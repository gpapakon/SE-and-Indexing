<ABSTRACT>
Viridin, viridiol, demethoxyviridin, 
demethoxyviridiol, virone, and wortmannolone, and analogs 

thereof, are inhibitors of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase. The 
compounds are particularly useful for inhibiting 

phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase in vertebrates and for treating 
phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase-dependent conditions, especially 

neoplasms, restenosis and atherosclerosis, and bone disorders in 
vertebrates.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method of 
inhibiting cytoplasmic phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI 3-kinase) 
in a lysed cell, whole cell, tissue preparation, or 
organism with viridin, demethoxyviridin, viridiol, 
demethoxyviridiol, virone, or wortmannolone, or an analog of one 
of the named compounds. Such compounds also can be used to 
selectively inhibit phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase in 
vertebrates, particularly humans, and to treat 
phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase-dependent conditions, particularly 
neoplasms, in humans. The metabolism of inositol phospholipids is believed 
to be an essential part of the receptor-mediated signal 
transduction pathways in response to various hormones and growth 
factors [see, e.g., Berridge, M.J., et al., Nature, 312: 315-321 
(1984); Nishizuka, Y., Science, 225: 1365-1370 (1984)]. In this signaling pathway, two intracellular second 
messengers, inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate and diacylglycerol are 
generated through the hydrolysis of phosphatidyl 4,5-bisphosphate 
by phospholipase C. Inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate 
releases Ca²⁺ from intracellular Ca²⁺ stores leading to the 
activation of Ca²⁺/calmodulin-dependent kinase; diacylglycerol 
activates protein kinase C. Following breakdown, 
phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate is rapidly resynthesized 
by stepwise phosphorylation of phosphatidylinositol by 
phosphatidylinositol 4-kinase and phosphatidylinositol-4-phosphate 
kinase. These 2 kinases appear to play important 
roles in the production of second messengers (see, e.g., Duell, 
T.F., US Pat. No. 5,001,064 (1991); Shibasaki, F., et al., J.Biol. Chem., 266 (13): 8108-8114 (1991).  More recently, the existence of another 
phosphatidylinositol kinase has been identified and associated 
with certain activated tyrosine kinases [Courtneidge, S.A., et 
al., Cell, 50: 1031-1037 (1987); Kaplan, D.R., et al., Cell, 50: 
1021-1029 (1987)]. This kinase, identified as 
phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase, has been found to phosphorylate 
the 3-position of the inositol ring of phosphatidylinositol (PI) 
to form phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphate (PI-3P) [Whitman, D., 
et al., Nature, 332: 664-646 (1988). In addition to PI, this enzyme also can phosphorylate 
phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate and phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate 
to produce phosphatidylinositol 3,4-bisphosphate 
and phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate (PIP₃), 
respectively [Auger, K.R., et al., Cell, 57: 167-175 (1989)]. PI 3-kinase physically associates with tyrosine 
kinases such as pp60v-src, polyoma
