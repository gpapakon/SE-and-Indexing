<ABSTRACT>
To optically reproduce digital speech data recorded on an emulsifier surface 
(3) of a motion picture film (1), the film is illuminated with light (6) from the side of 

a base surface (2) of the film, and the light transmitted through the emulsifier surface 
(3) is collected as incident light by a reproducing lens (4). In this way, it is possible 

to reduce variations in the volume of light of the reproduced digital data which would 
otherwise be caused by scratches or dust present on the base surface (2) of the film 

(1).

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to reproducing digital signals, for example digital speech 
data, optically recorded on a film, such as a motion picture film, or the like. If, in a transmission optical system, such as a microscope, the illumination 
efficiency is to be taken into account, it is desirable to equate the numerical aperture 
NA of the reproducing light with the numerical aperture of the illuminating light. In 
addition, for maximizing the resolution, it is preferred to set the numerical aperture 
of the illuminating light to 1.5 times that of the reproducing light. Consequently, in 
the conventional transmitting optical system, such as the microscope, the numerical 
aperture of the illuminating light is set so as to be not more than 1.5 times that of the 
reproducing light. The numerical aperture of the illuminating light is given by the 
sine of a divergence angle of a light ray with respect to the optical axis 
with a pinhole placed on an illuminated surface. It is now assumed that speech data is read from a conventional motion picture 
film 1 on which speech data has been recorded as a digital pattern, and signals are 
read from the side of a base surface 2 of the motion picture film, as shown in Fig. 1. 
In such case, should there exist a scratch 5 on the base surface 2, and should 
the numerical aperture of the illuminating  
 
light be larger than the numerical aperture of the reproducing 
lens 4, the scratch tends to be defocused to a lesser extent, so 
that the light of the image of the scratch 8 on the base surface 
2 is collected by the reproducing lens 4. Consequently, when the 
light beam collected by the reproducing lens 4 is converted into 
electrical signals (digital signals), the resulting signals are 
corrupted significantly by the scratch 5. On the other hand, if the numerical aperture of the 
illuminating system is set to not more than 1.5 times of the 
numerical aperture of the reproducing system, the illuminating 
optical system of a complex structure is required, because a 
light guide having a larger divergence angle cannot be employed. In addition, if the digital speech data recorded on the 
motion picture film 1 is to be reproduced, with the numerical 
aperture of the illuminating system being set so as to be not 
more than 1.5 times as large as that of the reproducing system, 
the scratch or dust is raised in modulation factor, so that the 
reproduced digital signals are affected in an increasing amount. 
Furthermore, if the speech data on the motion picture film 1 is 
to
