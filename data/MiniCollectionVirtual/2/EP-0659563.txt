<ABSTRACT>
An ink jet recording apparatus includes an ink 
jet recording head as an essential component, and 

the ink jet recording head has a wiring structure 
which assures that a quantity of electricity loss 

induced by wiring resistance can be reduced. A 
plurality of substantially rectangular heaters 2 are 

formed at the positions in the vicinity of one end 
edge 1a of a device substrate 1 while they are 

arranged in an array in parallel with the one end 
edge 1a of the device substrate 1 with a 

predetermined distance held between adjacent heaters 
2. Each heater 2 is composed of heaters 2a and 2b 

in the form of a pair. A common wiring portion 3 
made of a metallic material such as aluminum or the 

like is formed between a pair of heaters 2, and it 
is electrically connected to electrodes of the 

heaters 2 on one side of the latter on the common 
basis. In addition, separated wiring portions 4 

each made of a metallic material such as aluminum or 
a similar material are formed on electrodes of the 

heaters 2 on the opposite side to the foregoing one.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an ink jet recording head
according to claim 1, to an ink cartridge according to claim
9 or 10 and to an ink jet recording apparatus according to
claim 11 or 12.From the document US-A-4 847 639 a generic ink jet recording
head is known in which each of the thermal energy generating
elements is connected with the common connecting portion via
one wiring portion, respectively.From the documents US-A-4631555 and EP-A-549 211 other wiring
structures can be gathered in which - as in the US-A-4 847
639 - each of the thermal energy generating elements is
connected with the common connecting portion via one
individual wiring portion.Here, it should be construed that a word
"recording" means a technical concept of applying
ink to all kinds of recording mediums each adapted
to receive ink from the ink jet recording head,
e.g., cloth, thread, paper and various kind of
sheet-shaped material, or of performing the ink
application independently on meaning of an image to
be recorded. Further, it should be construed that a
word "recording apparatus" includes a technical
concept defined by various kind of information
processing apparatus and a printer serving as an
outputting unit for the information processing
apparatus. The present invention can be applied to
each of the above apparatuses for practical use of
the latter.A recording apparatus having a function of
serving as a printer, a copying machine, a facsimile
and so forth or a recording apparatus operable as an 
outputting unit for a complex type electronic
equipment and a work station such as a computer, a
word processor and so forth is constructed such that
an image is recorded on a recording medium in
conformity with an image information. For example,
an ink jet recording system has been hitherto known
as one of recording systems usable for the
apparatuses as mentioned above. The ink jet
recording system makes it possible to record an
image on a recording medium with more excellent
fineness than any other type of recording system.
For this reason, attention has been hitherto paid to
the ink jet recording system in additional
consideration of a possibility that each recording
operation can be performed at a comparatively high
speed while generating a low intensity of noisy
sound.As is heretofore known in the art, an ink jet
recording head usable for practicing the ink jet
recording system (hereinafter referred to simply as
a recording head) is constructed such that a
plurality of square or rectangular heaters (each
serving as a
