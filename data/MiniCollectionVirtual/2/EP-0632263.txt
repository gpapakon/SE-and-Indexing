<ABSTRACT>
A method for examining a gas is proposed, in which the gas to be examined is fed through a measuring arrangement (13) which is subject to contamination by particles in the gas to be examined. Determination of the CO2 concentration in the undiluted gas which is then admixed with ambient air (15) is provided. The CO2 concentration in the diluted gas is subsequently redetermined. The examination result (28) determined by the measuring arrangement (13) is corrected as a function of the two results of the CO2 concentration measurements. The method according to the invention is suitable for the examination of soot-containing exhaust gases, especially exhaust gases of a diesel internal-combustion engine.

Method for analyzing a gas, having a measuring
arrangement through which the gas to be analyzed is

conducted, characterized in that firstly the CO
2
 content
of the gas to be analyzed is determined, in that ambient

air (15) is then mixed in with the gas to be analyzed, in
that subsequently the CO
2
 content of the diluted gas to
be analyzed is determined again, and in that the result

(28) of the analysis determined by a measuring arrangement
(13) is corrected in a signal-processing arrangement

(29) as a function of the two results of the CO
2

determinations.
Method according to Claim 1, characterized in
that the ratio of the two results of the CO
2
 determinations
is calculated.
Method according to Claim 1, characterized in
that the mixture is within the range of 1:1 to 1:450,

preferably up to 1:100.
Method according to Claim 1, characterized in
that the measuring arrangement (13) contains an optical

route through which the gas to be analyzed runs.
Method according to Claim 4, characterized in
that the measuring arrangement (13) carries out a

turbidity measurement and/or a scattered-light
measurement.
Method according to Claim 1, characterized by the
use for analyzing exhaust gases containing soot.
Method according to Claim 6, characterized in
that the exhaust gas of a diesel internal combustion

engine is provided as gas to be analyzed.
