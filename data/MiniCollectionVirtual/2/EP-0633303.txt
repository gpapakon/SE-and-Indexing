<ABSTRACT>
An integrated gasification combined cycle power 
generation system in which a carbonaceous material, such 

as coal, is gasified combusted in a gasifier to provide 
synthesis gas which mixes with ash produced as a result of 

the gasification. The mixture is cooled below the 
softening temperature of the ash before the gas is 

separated from the ash and is used to drive a gas 
turbine. Heat from the combustion process is removed from 

the gas and the ash and is used to produce steam.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to an combined cycle power 
generation system and method utilizing a coal fired 
gasifier and, more particularly, to such a system and 
method in which synthesis gas is produced and is used to 
provide heat for a steam cycle and to drive a gas turbine. In order to reduce sulfur dioxide emission levels in 
fossil fuel power stations, a generation of stack gas 
clean up equipment has evolved which removes, or scrubs, 
sulfur dioxide from the steam generator flue gases prior 
to their release into the atmosphere. However, this is 
expensive largely due to the equipment required and the 
high volume of gases that must be processed.  As a result, a gasification process has evolved in 
which a carbonaceous material, such as particulate coal, 
is gasified in, for instance, an entrained flow gasifier. 
A combustible synthesis gas ("syngas") is produced by the 
gasification of the carbonaceous material. 
Desulfurization is accomplished after the syngas is cooled 
sufficiently using well known syngas scrubbers. The gas 
is then passed to a gas turbine combustor and then to the 
gas turbine expander which drives an electric generator. In the production of electric power, improved 
efficiencies can be achieved by utilizing a combined gas 
turbine and steam turbine cycle. In these arrangements 
the syngas is used to drive a gas turbine as described 
above while a steam turbine cycle is carried out with 
steam which is produced from cooling the syngas and the 
combustion gas leaving the gas turbine. However, in these arrangements the gasification of 
the carbonaceous material produces a bulk ash which, due 
to the fact that it is in an environment in which the 
temperature is above it's softening temperature, becomes 
sticky and molten causing fouling on reactor and heart 
exchanges surfaces. The soft ash particles are also 
extremely difficult to handle and transport which is a  
 
major problem since heat must subsequently be removed from 
the particles and from a mixture of syngas and the 
particles. It is therefore an object of the present invention to 
provide a system and method utilizing a coal fired 
gasifier in a power generation system. It is a further object of the present invention to 
provide a system and method of the above type in which 
syngas is produced which is utilized to drive a gas 
turbine. Is is a still further object of the the present 
invention to provide a system and method of the above type 
in which the bulk ash produced as a result of the 
gasification of the
