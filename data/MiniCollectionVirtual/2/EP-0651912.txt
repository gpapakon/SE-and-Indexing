<ABSTRACT>
The purpose of the present invention is to provide a miniature housing for semiconductor components and/or passive electronic components which can be introduced into thin flexible printed circuit boards, in which the electronic components can be contacted via microwire and which can withstand the pressures and temperatures arising in plastic board lamination or injection moulding. According to the invention, this purpose is attained in that the upper side of a plastic housing frame (9) has a shape rising from the inside to the outside in three stages, the innermost stage comprising through holes, the underside of the housing frame being connected to a metal conductor frame (1) and in that there are through holes (8) in the housing frame (9) at those points beneath which are located the contact surfaces of the conductor frame terminals which taper in the lower region. The invention relates to a miniature housing for electronic components, preferably for the protected arrangement of electronic components like semiconductor chips and the like.

<CLAIMS>
Circuit board with a miniature casing for electronic components with two
casing shells being designed as base shell (16) and cover shell (17) and

present a cavity (18) in their centre which cavity is greater than the surface
of the electronic components to be held, wherein


the casing shells (16;17) consist of a material which is dimensionally stable
at a temperature of up to 200Â°C, resistant to bending, and electrically

insulating,
the lower side of the circuit board (22) is fixed by means of circuit-board
glue (25) to the surface of the edge of the base shell (16),
the circuit board (22) has a structure made of metallic conductor runs (23)
and connection pads (24) on the upper side, and it is provided with an

opening (26) which is of the same size as the cavity in the base shell (16),
electronic components are arranged on the bottom of the cavity (18) of the
base shell (16),
cavities (18) are filled out with casting resin (14), and
the edges of the casing shells (16;17) are glued together by means of the
casting resin (14).
Miniature casing as claimed in claim 1, 
characterized in that
 the
connection pads (24) of the electronic components (11) and the connection

pads (24) of the circuit board (22) are connected via microwires (12). 
Miniature casing as claimed in claim 1 or 2, 
characterized in that
 the
shell edges of the base shell (16) and of the cover shell (17) present adjusting

holes (20) and adjusting pins (19) which engage into one another when the
casing shells (16;17) have been assembled.
