<ABSTRACT>
Inspection machines are preferably designed as rotary units and equipped with various test devices and inspection devices, through which the bottles run. It is necessary to monitor these inspection devices from time to time. For this purpose, test bottles are moved through the machine. In these systems, it is not possible to ascertain which test bottle has been selected for which inspection device, so that, for example in the absence of one or more test bottles, the particular system is not checked and this deficiency cannot be indicated. The object of the present invention is to provide a method by which the inspection devices to be checked can be addressed, evaluated and monitored in a controlled manner. This object is achieved in that a recognition system for the test-bottle type is arranged upstream of, at or downstream of the particular inspection device and transmits the recognition signal to an allocation system which monitors the inspection device allocated to the test signal for its inspection result and which triggers a fault signal if the particular inspection device does not respond.

Method for testing the working capacity of inspection units (6,7,8) in bottle inspecting
machines wherein test bottles of various types with respective markings

pass through the bottle inspection machine and are tested by the associated inspection
units (6,7,8), wherein an identification system (9) emits an identification

signal corresponding to the respective test bottle type, characterised by the fact
that the identification system (9) and the inspection units (6,7,8) are associated

with each other, and wherein the identification signal is transferred to a coordination
and control system, wherein the inspection result of the inspection unit associated

with the test bottle type recognised by the identification system (9) is
controlled and in case of non-operation of the respective inspection unit, an error

signal is triggered off.
Method as claimed in claim 1, characterised by the fact that the inspection units
(6,7,8) are provided with one identification system (9) each.
Device for testing the working capacity of inspection units in bottle inspecting machines,
characterised by the fact that the conveying route of the test bottles is provided

with a sensor and a coordination and control system and identifying the respective
markings to which (system) the sensor signals are transmitted to, and

which controls the inspection result of the inspection unit associated with the identified
test bottle type.
Method and device for testing the working capacity of inspection units in bottle
inspecting machines, characterised by the fact that the conveying route of test

bottles are provided with sensors identifying the respective markings, each
(sensor) being specially associated with the inspection unit and with the help of

which the respective inspection unit is independently controlled during passage of
an associated test bottle.
Device as claimed in claim 3 or 4, characterised by the fact that a light receiver
with a photo conductor serves as sensor.
