<ABSTRACT>
Disclosed are Agonists and Antagonists of bombesin which are derivatives of naturally occuring bombesin possessing modified derivatives of phenylalanine. Agonist and antagonist activities are confirmed using conventional competitive binding and biochemical assays as well as conventional physiological tests and the use of these derivatives in a variety of conditions. Use of these peptides may be useful for stimulating or antagonizing growth of tissues, especially lung, and of digestion. Treatment comprises administering to a patient in need thereof, an effective amount of a bombesin analog.

<DESCRIPTION>
 PHENYLALANINE ANALOGS OF BOMBESINFIELD OF INVENTIONThis invention relates to novel phenylalanine analogs of Bombesin which are potentially useful as pharmaceuticals.BACKGROUND OF INVENTION Bombesin (ID#2) is a 14 amino acid peptide, originally isolated from the skin of the frog Bombina bombina. Bombesin is also structurally related to a number of other peptides including Gastrin Releasing Peptide (ID#1), and Litorin (ID#3) (See Sequence Identification).Bombesin is known to have a range of effects including stimulation of the nervous system, reduction of renal blood flow, secretion of pituitary hormones, growth promotion, memory retention, induction of myoelectric and contractile activity of intestinal myocytes, induction of gastric and pancreatic secretion, and bolster the immune system. There has been considerable interest in modulating these activities in the design and development of bombesin analogs as possible mimics or inhibitors of bombesin action in the body. 

 The bombesin-dependent responses occur through a class of high-affinity (KD=lnm) cell surface receptors that bind bombesin. Binding of bombesin to its cell surface receptor elicits cell mitogenic responses in a number of tissues. The mitogenic response has been demonstrated in a number of cell types including Swiss 3T3 embryo fibroblast cells, human bronchial epithelial cells, human small cell lung carcinoma cells, rat gastrin cells , and rat pancreatic cells. Similarly, bombesin induction of gastric and pancreatic secretions, important for digestive functions, occur through the receptors found on cells of pancreatic (B-Cells) and intestinal gastrin cells (G-cells).Binding of bombesin to its extracellular receptor evokes a number of intracellular signals including activation of G-proteins, which in turn activates phospholipase C (PLC). PLC in turn converts phosphatidylinositol phosphate (PI) into inositol 1,4,5,- triphosphate (IP3) and diacylglycerol (DAG). IP3 and DAG are believed to be intracellular signals for cellular mediated events.• Structure-activity studies indicate that receptor- binding generally requires a peptide ligand containing an amidated C-terminus, and generally the presence of the last eight a ino acids. Recent work has concentrated on modifying the carboxy terminal (C-terminal) region of bombesin to selectively modulate the receptor interaction utilizing a variety of different types of C-terminal modified analogs. These modifications have included, for example, incorporation of D-amino acids, non-peptide bonds,
