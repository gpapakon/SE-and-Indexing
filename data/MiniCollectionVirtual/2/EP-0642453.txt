<ABSTRACT>
A lining (1) for a block-shaped container, which lining is made of flexible material and can be placed folded in the container, and can then be brought to the desired shape in the container through filling. The lining is folded up or rolled up to the form of an elongated strip, which can be placed in the container in a position in which it extends with its lengthwise direction at least between the top edge and the bottom wall thereof, in such a way that during filling the lining can unfold relative to said lengthwise direction towards the two opposite sides.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a method of folding a lining for a 
block-shaped container, which lining is made of flexible material and can 
be placed folded in the container, and can then brought to the desired 
shape in the container through filling. Such linings, which are known 
from EP-A-326730, are generally used when a liquid or a powdered material 
has to be packed in a container which itself is not completely tight. The 
lining provides the desired barrier properties (tightness), while the 
container supplies the desired strength for supporting the packed 
material. Such containers can be many different sizes, for example their 
capacity can be 1 cubic metre or a number of cubic metres. The known lining comprises at least two identical sheets, with 
the filling aperture in one sheet, and a shut-off valve/tap holder in the 
other sheet. During its fitting, the lining is folded together in such a 
way that it can be placed flat on the bottom of the container. During the 
subsequent filling of the lining, the top surface rises up, and the wall 
must gradually unfold in the vertical direction. This known lining and the method of filling thereof give rise 
to problems. The internal pressure occurring during the filling, however 
small it may be, causes the unfolding wall to be pressed against the container. 
This produces friction, which increases as the internal excess 
pressure increases during the filling. The result of all this can be that 
the lining is not unfolded completely, and that folds remain in the side 
wall of the container. Such folds give rise to tension concentrations in 
the lining material, which can lead to leakage. When filled, the lining 
can easily tear or become porous at those folded places, with the result 
that the contents can leak out. In practice, the filling of such linings 
must also be carried out with great care, which means that the filling 
has to be carried out by experienced personnel. The object of the invention is to provide a method of folding a 
lining which can be filled without problems in a block-shaped container.  
 
This object is achieved by correspondingly folding a lining of flexible 
plastics material into an elongate strip having a width which is substantially 
smaller than the width of a side wall panel of a block-shaped 
container, of placing said folded lining against a side wall panel of 
said container to extend in its lengthwise direction at least between the 
top and the bottom wall of said container, and of unfolding said folded 
lining in

Method of folding a lining of flexible plastics 
material into an elongate strip having a width which is substantially 

smaller than the width of a side wall panel of a block-shaped container, 
of placing said folded lining against a side wall panel of said 

container to extend in its lengthwise direction at least between the 
top and the bottom wall of said container, and of unfolding said folded 

lining in directions towards both the adjacent side wall panels and the 
opposite side wall panel of the container. 
Method according to claim 1, in which the strip continues beyond 
the top edge of the side wall panel (13) as well as over the bottom 

wall with a piece of which the size, in the lengthwise direction of the 
strip, corresponds essentially to half the length of the bottom wall, 

in such a way that when folded the strip can be placed over the entire 
length of said side wall panel (13) of the container and over half 

the length of the bottom wall adjacent thereto. 
Method according to Claim 2, in which the lining (1) is made 
of at least two identical rectangular or square pieces (2, 3) of 

flexible sheet material which are welded to each other at their peripheral edges 
(23), one sheet being provided with a fixing means for positioning the lining with respect 

to the container. 
Method according to Claim 3, in which the fixing means point is positioned with respect 
to the bottom wall of the container, said fixing means being an emptying outlet (5) 

of the liner. 
Method according to Claim 4, in which the pieces of sheet material 
are divided into at least two equal square halves by a bisecting 

line, the four corner parts (6) of the halves are each folded towards 
the centre of the pieces, and the parts lying to the sides of the bisecting  

 
line are folded over or rolled up one or more times, in such a 

way that the lining forms a strip made up of several layers lying on 
top of one another. 
Method according to Claim 5, in which the four corner parts (6) 

are folded over or rolled up, leaving clear at least a narrow space (7) 
between them, in which space the fixing means lies. 
Method according to one of the preceding claims, comprising the 
step of providing a pack in which the lining is accommodated, 

said pack comprising a number of panels (11, 13-17) which in the collapsed 
position enclose the lining (1), and in the opened-out position 

cover a number of walls and the bottom of the container. 
Method according to Claim 7, in which the pack comprises a central 
panel (11), the dimensions of which correspond to the bottom of 

the container, and side panels (13, 14) which are provided at two opposite 
edges of the bottom, and the dimensions of which correspond to 

those of two opposite walls of the container, in such a way that the 
side panels (13, 14) can be opened out on said walls when the central 

panel (11) is placed on the bottom, and the lining (1) is fixed to one 
of the side panels. 
Method according to Claim 8, in which the side panels (13, 14) 
of the pack have at both sides auxiliary panels (15, 16) which can be 

opened out on the other two walls of the container.
