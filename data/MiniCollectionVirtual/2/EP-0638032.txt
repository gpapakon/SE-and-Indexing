<ABSTRACT>
The present invention relates to an apparatus for imparting a movement to an actuation of an object, such as a brake, and comprising a bracket (2) with an operating device (4), preferably in the form of a handle (24), a stirrup, an arm or a lever which is disposed in connection with the object via a connecting device (5), the connecting device (5) including an element (6) which is rotatably disposed in the bracket (2) about a first pivot (9), a shaft or the like, and a coupling device (7) which is anchored with the said element (6) in a portion (8) a distance from the said first pivot (9), and that the operating device (4) is secured with the said element (6).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an apparatus for imparting a 
movement to and actuating an object and comprises a bracket with 
an operating device, preferably in the form of a handle, stirrup, arm or 
lever and which is disposed in connection with the object via 
connection devices. The object may, for example, consist of a brake for 
a wheel on a vehicle, implement or other wheeled apparatus. Such an actuating apparatus or regulator may be employed within a 
multiplicity of different fields, for example, for triggering or operating 
an apparatus, an object such as the exemplified brake, a contactor or 
for tightening a line or other elongate object. On occasions, such 
apparatuses are provided for being able to actuate an object or the 
like to assume two different operative positions. An apparatus of this general kind is known from DE-A 1 803 891 
which discloses a device for operating an object, which apparatus 
comprises a bracket with an operating device which is pivotally 
disposed in relation to the bracket via a connecting device, said 
connecting device being in the form of an element which is rotatably 
disposed in the bracket about a first pivot, a coupling device being 
disposed between the element and the object, said operating device 
further including a first abutment for cooperation with the element. 
This device presents the features recited in the introductory part of 
claim 1 annexed hereto. In this prior-art device which is designed for actuation of the brake as 
well as of the throttle valve of motorbikes, the operating device, 
referred to as a brake lever, is used to simultaneously actuate the 
throttle and the brake. The lever may be set in different positions for 
normal speed, slow speed, and braking. However, there is no possibility of fixing the operating device or brake 
lever in the brake-application position, omitting the need for the user  
 
to continuously exert a force on the operating device in order to keep 
the brake operative. Nor are any means provided to allow adjustment 
of the force required to actuate the lever or operating device to the 
strength of the user. There is, however, a need for such an apparatus. The apparatus 
should be simple to handle, also by people that suffer from restricted 
powers of movement, in particular in the hands and/or suffer from 
reduced strength in the hands. Furthermore, there is a need in such 
apparatuses to be able to cause the apparatus to assume a position of 
rest in an operative position, i.e. in a position in which the

<CLAIMS>
Apparatus for operating an object, which apparatus comprises a 
bracket (2) with an operating device (4) which is pivotally disposed in 

relation to the bracket (2) via a connecting device (5), said connecting 
device (5) being in the form of an element (6) which is rotatably 

disposed in the bracket (2) about a first pivot (9), a coupling device (7) 
being disposed between the element (6) and the object; said operating 

device (4) further including a first abutment (14) for cooperation with 
the element (6), 
characterized
 in that the operating device (4) 
is pivotally disposed on the element (6) about a second pivot (10) and 

in that it is formed with a second abutment (17) for cooperation with 
the bracket (2). 
Apparatus according to claim 1, 
characterized
 in that the 
first abutment (14) on the operating device (4) is arranged to 

cooperate with the element (6) for pivoting the element (6) by means of 
the operating device (4) about the first pivot (9) to a second position 

(12). 
Apparatus according to claim 1 or 2, 
characterized
 in that 
the bracket (2) is formed with a first abutment (18), with a second 

abutment (20), and with a face (19) or sliding surface extending 
between said abutments for cooperation with the second abutment 

(17) on the operating device (4) for pivoting the element (6) about the 
first pivot (9) by means of the operating device (4) and the second 

pivot (10) to a third position (13). 
Apparatus according to any one of the preceding claims, 
characterized
 
in that a stop member (22) in the form of a separate 

body may be positioned in the bracket (2), said body being replaceable 
by one or more other stop members (22) having other dimensions, 

differently positioned abutments (18, 20), a different extent of the 
sliding surface (19) between said abutments (18, 20) a different 

radius, curvature or the like of the sliding surface (19) or a rounded  
 

edge (21) located along the sliding edge (19), and/or a different 
position for the said rounded edge (21).
