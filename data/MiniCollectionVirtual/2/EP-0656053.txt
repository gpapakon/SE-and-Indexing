<DESCRIPTION>
 AUTOMATIC DISHWASHING DETERGENTField of inventionThe invention relates to a shear thickening aqueous liquid composition which is especially useful as an automatic dishwasher detergent composition. If the water content is low enough, shear thickening is exhibited.This invention also relates to liquid, aqueous, stable, effective, safe, detergent cleaning compositions which have shear thickening properties and are commonly referred to as detergents for cleaning of fabrics. The compositions are physically stable, do not separate, whereby the user is assured of the optimum performance to be expected from the various components and their amounts and ratios with respect to one another.Background of the InventionLiquid automatic dishwasher detergent compositions, both aqueous and nonaqueous, have recently received much attention, and the aqueous products have achieved commercial popularity. The acceptance and popularity of the liquid formulations as compared to the more conventional powder products stems from the convenience and performance of the liquid products. However, even the best of the currently available liquid formulations still suffer from two major problems, product phase instability and bottle residue, and to some extent cup leakage from the dispenser cup of the automatic dishwashing machine.Representative patent art in this area includes Rek, U.S. Patent 4,556,504;Bush, et al., U.S. Patent 4,226,736; Ulrich, U.S. Patent 4,431 ,559; Sabatelii.
