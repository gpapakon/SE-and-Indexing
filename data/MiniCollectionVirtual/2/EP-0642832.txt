<ABSTRACT>
Crushing machine with jaws (4,5) regulating the size of the material 
in exit by means of a controlled distance, between the fixed (5) and 

mobile jaw (4) and with a safety device against uncrushable material 
blocks, composed of interposed oleo-hydraulic cylinders (7) between 

one of the jaws and the body (1), the said cylinders (7) being connected 
to an oleo-hydraulic circuit with valves of maximum pressure.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention refers to an evolution of the patent entitled
"Frantumatore alternativo", (reciprocating crusher) filed on 19th
December 1990 at the Provincial Office of Industry, Commerce and
Artisanship of Venice with number IT-A-61977 B/90 and concerns
a new crushing machine with mouth opening adjustable jaws to
allow exit of different sizes of the material, by means of the
control of the distance between a fixed and mobile jaws, and with a
safety device against uncrushable material blocks that may
accidentally enter into the crushing chamber.The crushing machines with traditional jaws exploit the principle
of the breaking of the material that is being compressed between
two jaws, of which one is fixed and the other mobile, the mobile
jaw being operated by an eccentric power-operated shaft that acts
on the upper side and by an articulation of a connecting rod that
acts on the lower side, in the crusher called "a simple toggle", or
the hinged mobile jaw being linked to the frame in the upper part
and operated by an eccentric power-operated shaft through a
double articulation connecting rod, in the crusher called a
"double toggle". As is known, the traditional crushing machines
have an adjusting system for the size of the material in exit which
is awkward to use, being composed of a series of thicknesses
inserted or removed between the connecting rod and the casing
when the machine is standstill, this causes laboriousness and it is
known that in such machines the use of the safety device for
blocks of uncrushable material is remarkably unsuitable and 
wasteful, this device being composed of a well known connecting
rod or other breakable means that allows the mobile jaw to space
itself from the fixed one beyond the adjusting value, in order to
eliminate the uncrushable material without giving rise to further
and more serious damages to the machine. Since the security
system is based on the breaking of a component, the relative reset
involves a non-functional machine for many hours, for the
replacement of the damaged or broken components and a high
cost for the material and working.US-A-3099406 (H.A.P.KAUTZ) discloses an Ore Crusher
having two opposed reciprocating jaws. The jaws being hinged
upwards in the entry mouth and the reciprocation being operated
backwards in their exit mouth; in which there is a release
cylinder to allow accidental enlargement.
This solution does not allow adjusting the exit mouth opening, but
only safety against overpressure of a larger block not crushed.
Furthermore
</DESCRIPTION>
<CLAIMS>
A crushing machine with a fixed jaw (5) and a mobile jaw (4),
reciprocable in its upper mouth opening by a rotating eccentric

shaft (3), said mobile jaw (4) being connected to an oleo-hydraulic
adjustable cylinder means to vary the distance between

the jaws at their exit mouth opening for regulating the size of the
material in exit and for acting as a safety device against uncrushable

material blocks, wherein said cylinder means (7) is placed
between the body of the crusher and an intermediate lever means

(10), said intermediate lever means (10) being hinged on one
side to the structure of the machine (34), and on the other side

connected to the said mobile jaw (4) at its lower back end by means
of a connecting rod (14), a tie rod (15) associated with a

helical spring (16) being further provided,

characterized in that:

the intermediate lever means (10) is hinged on the crusher body
(1) at its upper end (34);
said tie rod (15), on one side is hinged to the end of said mobile
jaw (4) and on the opposite side, it is elastically connected to the

lower end of said lever means (10), to pull the lower end of the
intermediate lever means (10) towards the end of said mobile jaw

(4);
an oleo-hydraulic circuit to control said cylinder means (7) is
provided with over-pressure and no-return check valves (31,33)

to restore in the normal working position said mobile jaw (4),
when it is moved by passing uncrushable material that creates

said over-pressure.
A crushing machine according to claim 1, characterized in that
it further comprises in its oleo-hydraulic control circuit an oleo-pneumatic

accumulator (32).
