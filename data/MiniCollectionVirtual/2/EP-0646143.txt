<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to soluble macromonomers
having rigid-rod backbones, pendant, flexible,
solubilizing organic groups attached to the backbone, and
pendant reactive groups attached to the backbone of the
macromonomer chains. They can be chemically incorporated
into other polymer and monomer systems to yield
strengthened, stiffened polymer compositions.It is well known that the stiffness and strength of
a polymer are related to the flexibility of the polymer
chain on the molecular level. Thus, if the chemical
structure of the main chain restricts chain coiling and
flexing, the resulting polymer will be stiff and strong.
An example of a stiff polymer is poly-1,4-phenylene-1,4-terephthalamide
(PPTA). While PPTA can coil in solution,
the amide linkages and para-phenylene groups favor an
extended chain conformation. Fibers can be prepared in
which the chains are essentially all extended into rod-like
conformations, and these fibers are extraordinarily
strong and stiff. Unfortunately, PPTA is difficult to
process (except for fiber spinning) and cannot be molded
or extruded. In general, the more rigid the polymer main
chain the more difficult it is to prepare and process. Some applications require strong, stiff materials
that can be easily processed by molding or extrusion. A
widely used approach to obtain such stiff materials is to
add fillers such as carbon or silica, or to incorporate
fibers, such as glass and carbon fibers, into a relatively
flexible polymer, thereby forming a stiff, strong
composite material. The most widely utilized, high-performance
fiber-polymer composites are composed of
oriented carbon (graphite) fibers embedded in a suitable
polymer matrix.The improvements in strength and stiffness of
composites are related to the aspect ratio of the filler
or fiber, i.e., the length to diameter ratio of the
smallest diameter cylinder that will enclose the filler
or fiber. To contribute reasonable strength and stiffness
to the composite, the fibers must have an aspect ratio of
at least about 25, and preferably at least 100.
Continuous fibers have the highest aspect ratio and yield
the best mechanical properties but are costly to process.
Low aspect ratio materials, such as chopped fibers and
fillers, give limited improvement in mechanical
properties, but are easy and inexpensive to process. The
success of composites is demonstrated by their wide use
as structural materials.There are several drawbacks associated with composite
materials. Composites are often more costly than the unreinforced
poly
