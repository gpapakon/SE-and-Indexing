<ABSTRACT>
The electromechanical accelerometer for triggering (tripping) an occupant restraining system in vehicles has a sensor body (12) which is guided such that it can be displaced in a translatory fashion in a housing (10) and is prestressed into a rest position by means of a return spring (18). The sensor body (12) releases a spring-loaded striker (firing pin) or actuates by means of an actuating plunger (16) a pair (26, 28) of contacts which is situated in the circuit of an electric firing device. The prestressing force of the return spring (18) is already overcome at a low acceleration of approximately 2 g. After an initial stroke of approximately 2 mm, the movement of the sensor body is counteracted by an additional spring (24) whose spring force is a multiple of the force of the return spring (18). The following actuation stroke is only approximately 0.5 mm. A short response time is achieved in conjunction with good reliability against erroneous triggering.

<CLAIMS>
An acceleration sensor for activating a vehicular passenger
restraining system, having a sensor body (12) which is slidably

guided translatorically in a housing (10) and preloaded to a
rest position by a return spring (18) and movable against the

force of the return spring (18) into an actuating position due
to its mass inertia, wherein immediately prior to reaching the

actuating position the sensor body (12) is subjected to the
force of an additional spring (56) in the direction of its rest

position, characterized in that a firing pin (54) of the
acceleration sensor loaded by the additional spring (56) can be

moved out of a secured position into a release position by the
sensor body (12), in which it is perpendicularly movable with

respect to the direction of movement of the sensor body.
A sensor according to claim 1, characterized in that the
firing pin (54) is in its secured position supported, with a

ramp face (58) formed at a lateral projection (54), at a
corresponding support face (60) at the housing (10).
A sensor according to any one of the preceding claims,
characterized in that from its rest position up to the

additional spring (56) becoming effective the sensor body (12)
executes an initial stroke of approx. 2 Â± 1 mm followed by an

actuating stroke of roughly 0.3 to 0.8 mm up to reaching the
actuating position.
A sensor according to any one of the preceding claims,
characterized in that the spring force of the return spring

(18) in the rest position of the sensor body (12) can be 
overcome by the inertial force occurring at the sensor body

under the effect of an acceleration of approx. 2 g.
A sensor according to any one of the preceding claims,
characterized in that the combined spring force of the return

spring (18) and of the additional spring (56) can be overcome
by the inertial force occurring at the sensor body (12) under

the effect of an acceleration of approx. 12 g.
A sensor according to any one of the preceding claims,
characterized in that the sensor body (12) has an actuating pin

(16) on its side facing the actuating position.
