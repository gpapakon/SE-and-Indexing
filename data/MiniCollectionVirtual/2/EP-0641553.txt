<ABSTRACT>
The wound dressing securement device has one or more 
flexible adhesive base member strips (12,14) that are secured to the 

skin around or at opposite sides of a wound (50) with sufficient 
clearance for a wound dressing (60). A plurality of sheet 

retention members (30) joined to one or more of the base members (12,14) 
project vertically from an exposed surface of the base 

member. A flexible, foldable, stretchable hold-down sheet (40) 
member has a plurality of openings to engage with engagement 

heads provided on the sheet retention members (30). The hold-down 
sheet member is sized to form a cover for the underlying 

wound dressing and bears against the wound dressing to hold 
it in position on the wound. When the wound dressing is to 

be changed, the hold-down sheet member is disengaged from the 
sheet retention members to uncover the wound dressing, and 

make it accessible for removal and replacement. The adhesive 
base member(s) remain in place during repeated changes of the 

wound dressing.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention pertains to medical devices for the
care of wounds, and more particularly to a wound dressing
securement device that securely holds a dressing on a wound
and permits easy removal and interchange of the wound
dressing.A wound is generally manifested by a breach in the
skin that may be due to injury or surgery. The healing
process is normally promoted by treating the wound with an
antiseptic and dressing the wound with suitable bandage.
The wound dressing is usually secured by applying a self-securing
attachment member such as adhesive tape directly
over the dressing.As healing progresses it is often beneficial to
periodically change the wound dressing. Thus the adhesive
tape that secures the wound dressing must be removed,
generally by peeling the tape from the skin in the area of
the wound. In many instances, the peeling of adhesive tape
from the area of the wound can irritate or aggravate a
condition of soreness that is a common characteristic of a
wound.In order to minimize any discomfort and irritation
that may accompany the change or removal of a wound dressing,
it is well known to utilize wound dressing securement devices 
that do not require adhesive attachment of the dressing. One
known wound dressing securement device includes a pair of
remotely positioned adhesive strips with releasable ties or
laces such as the DermicelÂ® Montgomery strap made by Johnson
& Johnson. The adhesive strips are secured to the skin at a
predetermined distance from opposite sides of a wound and
have a marginal non-adhesive perforated portion for the
lacing.The wound dressing or bandage for the wound is held
in place between the spaced adhesive strips by tying together
the lacing that extends from each adhesive strip such that
the tied lacing secures the wound dressing on the wound.U.S. Patent 4,423,731 shows a similar construction
of two spaced adhesive strips with lacing bonded to the
strips. The wound dressing is held in position on the wound
beneath the tied lacing rather than being held in place by
adhesive securement.When the wound dressing is to be changed, the lacing
is untied. The wound dressing can then be accessed and
changed without the need to remove the oppositely disposed,
remotely positioned adhesive strips or the untied lacing
since they do not interfere with the changing of the wound
dressing.Thus the adhesive strips and lacing can be used
again and again to secure each of the new replacement wound 
dressings. The prospect of wound irritation due to removal
of self-securing adhesive

<CLAIMS>
A wound dressing securement device comprising,

(a) a flexible base member (12) having an adhesive attachment surface
and a non-adhesive obverse surface,
(b) a plurality of sheet retention members (30) joined to the base
member in a predetermined pattern and projecting from the obverse surface of

said base member, characterised by
(c) a flexible and stretchable hold-down sheet member (40) haying a
predetermined size for superposition over a wound dressing, said sheet member

having engagement means formed as openings (42) in said sheet member for
receiving respective ones of said sheet retention members to engage said sheet

member with said sheet retention members, said openings being in a grid-like
pattern in said sheet member.
The wound dressing securement device as claimed in claim 1 wherein said
openings (42) are of diamond shape.
The wound dressing securement device as claimed in claim 1 wherein said
sheet member includes openings (42) in the shape of diamonds, said openings

forming a grid-like pattern in said sheet member.
The wound dressing securement device as claimed in any preceding claim
wherein said sheet member is in the form of an elastic mesh.
The wound dressing securement device as claimed in any of claims 1-3
wherein said sheet member is in the form of an elastic netting.
The wound dressing securement device as claimed in any preceding claim
wherein the non-adhesive obverse surface of said base member (12 or 14) is

formed with plastic material. 
The wound dressing securement device as claimed in claim 6 wherein said
sheet retention members are formed of plastic and are ultrasonically welded to

the non-adhesive surface of said base member.
The wound dressing securement device as claimed in any preceding claim
wherein said sheet retention members include a stem portion (32) having an

engagement head (36) that is receivable in the engagement means of said sheet
member.
The wound dressing securement device as claimed in claim 8 wherein
said sheet member includes openings (42) and the engagement heads (36) of said

stem portions are receivable in respective ones of said openings of said sheet
member such that reception of the engagement heads in the respective openings

of said sheet member normally prevents disengagement of the sheet member from
said sheet retention members.
The wound dressing securement device as claimed in any preceding claim
wherein said openings have a smaller dimension than said engagement head and

said sheet member is stretchable to engage respective said openings with
respective said engagement heads.
The wound dressing securement device as claimed in any preceding claim
including a pair of said base members adapted to be spaced a predetermined

distance from each other and said sheet member is formed of a stretchable
material for stretchable engagement with the sheet retention members of each

said base member.
The wound dressing securement device as claimed in any preceding claim
wherein said sheet retention members are rigid and project vertically from said

base member.
The wound dressing securement device as claimed in any preceding claim
wherein said adhesive is a hydrocolloid adhesive. 
The wound dressing securement device as claimed in any preceding claim
wherein said base member is in the form of an elongated strip.
The wound dressing securement device as claimed in claim 1 wherein said
base member (102) is of annular form.
The wound dressing securement device as claimed in claim 1 wherein said
hold-down sheet member (128) is joined to another flexible base member (130).
The wound dressing securement device as claimed in claim 16 wherein
said hold-down sheet member (128) is bonded to said other flexible base member
