<ABSTRACT>
A device (10) for sensing electrical current in a conductor (11) utilises a material (22) exhibiting the Faraday magneto-optic effect as the sensitive element. The material (22) is located between two polarisers (23, 24) to receive via a graded index collimator lens (25) an optical signal from a source (18) and to deliver via a graded index collimator lens (26) an optical signal to a detector (20). The optical signals are guided by multi mode optical fibres (14, 16). The change in rotation of the polarisation is a measure of the electrical current in the conductor (11). Errors in the measure may arise due to the effects of temperature, vibration or cross-talk and specific arrangements for compensating against these errors are disclosed both individually and cumulatively.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to the measurement of electric
current using optical techniques.The measurement of electrical current is
conventionally undertaken by current transformers utilising
an iron core with a toroidal winding but a number of
disadvantages arise from these devices which lead to
operational incompatabilities with modern compact medium or
high voltage electrical systems.More recently it has been proposed to use a current
measuring device comprising a sensor which is coupled
optically to source and detection circuitry and which
incorporates a material exhibiting the Faraday magneto-optic
effect. A linearly polarised light signal is
incident on the material and the quantum of rotation in the
plane of polarisation imposed on the signal emerging from
the material is a measure of the electrical current flowing
through an electrical conductor located adjacent the
material. JP-A-57 35760 suggests use of two different
magneto-optic materials in one sensor for independent
measurement of small and large electrical currents.The present invention is directed to provision of a
current measuring device utilising magneto-optic materials
and which is compensated against temperature variations
which affect the sensitivity of such materials.According to the present invention there is provided
an electrical current measuring device, for measuring the
alternating current in an electrical conductor, comprises
first and second measurement channels, each channel
comprising
a sensor adapted to be located adjacent the conductor
and coupled via optical fibres to source circuitry and
detector circuitry, the sensor incorporating a material
which exhibits the Faraday magneto-optic effect and the
source circuity being arranged to deliver an unpolarised
light signal which is subsequently polarised by a first
polariser to enable a linearly polarised light signal to 
be incident to the material and the quantum of rotation in
the plane of polarisation imposed on the signal emerging
from the material being monitored via a second polariser
by the detector circuitry as a measure of the electrical
current flowing in the conductor,
wherein the sensor material of the first channel
is different from the sensor material of the second
channel, having a differing Verdet constant, and a
differing temperature behaviour of the Verdet constant,
characterised in that each measurement channel is
arranged to maintain a constant light intensity incident on
its detector circuitry via a DC feedback loop from the
pertaining detector circuitry,
