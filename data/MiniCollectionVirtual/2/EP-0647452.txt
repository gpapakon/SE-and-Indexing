<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to black, infection-resistant
surgical devices and to a method for preparing such
devices.Surgical devices for use externally or internally
with humans or animals can serve to introduce bacterial,
viral, fungal or other undesirable infections. To prevent such
contamination, surgical devices can be treated with an
antimicrobial agent. For example, U.S. Patent No. 5,019,096
to Fox, Jr. et al. describes applying a coating to a medical
device, the coating containing a matrix polymer and
antimicrobial agents, preferably a combination of a silver
salt and chlorhexidine. EP-A2-328421 discloses using a
combination of a silver salt and chlorhexidine in the
preparation of medical devices, to improve their resistance to
infection. Other examples of antimicrobial devices include
U.S. Patent Nos. 3,674,901; 3,705,938; 3,987,797; 4,024,871;
and 4,612,337.Many surgical devices are made from one or more
filaments. The filaments can be woven, braided, knitted or
combined to provide a non-woven filamentary structure. The
filaments used to form surgical devices can be made from
natural or synthetic materials which may be absorbable or non-absorbable.
Where filaments of a synthetic absorbable polymer
are used to form the surgical device, steps must be taken to
ensure stability of the polymer if the device is to be stored
in a package for extended periods. Methods for improving the
storage stability of polymeric articles subject to hydrolytic
degradation are described, for example, in U.S. Patent Nos. 
5,037,429 and 5,051,272. US-A-5037429 discloses using
glycerol to improve the storage stability of surgical devices.Surgical devices can be dyed to impart a desired
color to the device. Frequently, the dye is incorporated
directly into the polymer from which the surgical device is
manufactured. It is sometimes desirable to employ a black
colored surgical device in surgical procedures. Currently,
logwood extract and carbon black are believed to be the only
materials employed to manufacture black colored surgical
devices.The present invention is defined in claim 1
hereinbelow. Dependent claims define optional or preferred
features.In a particularly useful embodiment, the
antimicrobial agent employed is silver lactate.Thus, according to the invention, a black-colored
surgical suture can be prepared by providing a substrate
having interstices or pores contacting the substrate with a
composition comprising glycerine and a silver salt, and
contacting the impregnated substrate with ethylene oxide. In

<CLAIMS>
Use of an impregnating agent to simultaneously impart
anti-microbial properties and a black colour to a synthetic surgical

suture which includes a substrate having interstices or
pores, by


(a) impregnating the surgical suture with the impregnating
agent, and
(b) contacting the impregnated surgical suture with ethylene
oxide,

the agent essentially being composed of a silver salt, a

soluble hygroscopic polyhydroxy compound, and a solvent.
Use of an impregnating agent as claimed in claim 1,
wherein the silver salt is silver lactate, the soluble

hygroscopic polyhydroxy compound is glycerine, and/or the
solvent is water.
Use of an impregnating agent as claimed in claim 1 or 2,
wherein the weight ratio of the silver salt and the soluble

hydroscopic polyhydroxy compound ranges between about 1:1 and
about 1:10, and is preferably 1:7.
Use of an impregnating agent as claimed in claim 2 or 3,
with water as the solvent, wherein the solvent is employed in

amounts to provide a solution concentration of from about 20%
to about 50%, preferably from about 30% to about 45%, by

weight of the compound of the soluble hygroscopic polyhydroxy
compound and based on the total weight of the solution.
Use of an impregnating agent as claimed in any one of
the preceding claims, wherein the surgical suture is a

braided yarn. 
Use of an impregnating agent as claimed in any one of
the preceding claims, wherein in step (a) said surgical

suture is impregnated with from about 0.005 to 0.100 grams of
said impregnating agent per gram of said surgical suture.
Use of an impregnating agent as claimed in any one of
the preceding claims, wherein said surgical suture is formed

at least in part of a bio-absorbable material.
