<ABSTRACT>
The saw, which in particular is for use when cutting carcases such as porkers and cattle, has a continuous saw blade (6) led round a driving wheel (2). The other end of the blade is guided in two fixed abutments (8) presenting therebetween a free operative length of the saw blade. The blade is pulled by a belt, a band or the like (10) pressing it against the driving wheel when the belt or band be tightened. The curve of the operative length of the saw blade can be adjusted in the fixed abutments. The complete saw is suspended from two axes perpendicular to each other.

<DESCRIPTION>
 Saw, in particular for use when cutting carcases such as porkers and cattle.The present invention relates to a band saw for use among others for cutting ribs of porkers, to be more specific carcases, but having capabilities for other sawings.In connection with rationalization and attempts to reduce the human physical stress within the slaughter¬ house industry research has been made to develop machines for cutting ribs and the like of carcases. Thus a circular saw has been developed for this rib sawing, but the saw has the disadvantage that a subsequent fine cutting of the bones is needed.The present invention provides a compact and handy saw, first of all being efficient by allowing the cutting to be performed in one single operation, such that one person can carry out the hard physical labour of three to four persons.The invention is characterized in that an endless saw blade is only guided around a single larger wheel in contrast to ordinary band saws, e.g. known from the wood working industry, which have two or several wheels, around which the saw blade is guided, tensioned and driven.By the saw according to the invention the exceeding wheels of the known band saws have been replaced by two arms having hard metal lining as abutment for the saw blade. The sawing takes places between the two arms. In the free area, where the sawing takes place, the blade can be adjusted to different curvatures according to the shape of the object. The main principle of the saw is the manner in which the power transfer and the rotation of the saw blade takes place. The power transfer takes place by the blade being urged against the edge of a 

 rotating wheel, on a part of the circumference by means of a toothed belt or other form of belt. This belt is guided by a number of pulleys arranged such that the blade is forced against the intended part of the circum¬ ference of the driven wheel. Cleaning is essential among others within the slaughterhouse industry and it appears that the use of a toothed belt reduces cleaning. Also, the saw is open downwardly, such that saw dust and the like is not stuck in the saw. Furthermore the saw is gyro suspended and counterbalanced, such that the opera¬ tor only should turn the saw following the bones, and should not lift, turn nor rotate the saw.An embodiment of the saw according to the invention particularly designed for cutting ribs of porkers' car¬ cases shall be described in the following with reference to the accompanying drawing. On the drawing is shown:Fig. 1 a schematically

C L A I M S :
1. Saw, in particular for use when cutting carcases such as porkers and cattle, and having an endless blade (6) guided around a driven wheel (6) having a relatively large diameter, characterized in that the opposite part of the blade is guided in two fixed guides presenting therebetween a free operative length of the saw blade, and where the blade can be forced in firm contact against the driven wheel by a belt, a band or the like (10) on the outer side of the blade on the driven wheel.
2. Saw according to claim l, characterized in that the fixed guides are designed as two arms (8) , terminat¬ ing in a curved portion having the same or approximately the same radius as the driven wheel.
3. Saw according to claim 2, characterized in that the opposite ends of the arms are retracted a short distance from the saw blade, such that the saw blade is in contact only with the curved end portions of the arms.
4. Saw according to claims 1,2 or 3 characterized in that the arms are designed such that the radius can be adjusted for adjustment of the curvature of the oper¬ ative length of the saw blade.
5. Saw according to claim 4, characterized in that the arms (8) being fixed, and that at least one is hav¬ ing an adjustable fitting in which or onto which the saw blade is guided, whereby the curvature of the saw blade can be modified.
6. Saw according to claim 1, characterized in that the belt, band or the like (10) is guided around turning 


 pulleys (12) placed at the free distance of the saw blade between the driven wheel and the fixed abutments, such that the blade is supported by the belt.
7. Saw according to claims 1 or 6, characterized in that the belt, band or the like (10) is led around a tension pulley wheel (14) placed above and displaceable towards and away from the driven wheel (2) respectively for slackening and tightening of the belt.
8. Saw according to claim 7, characterized in that the tension pulley device (14) is link motioned and displaceable by a compressed air cylinder (16) .
9. Saw according to claim 1, characterized in that the saw is pivotal around the drive axle (4,26) of the driven wheel as well as around an axis (12) perpendicu¬ lar in relation thereto.
10. Saw according to claim 1, characterized in that it comprises two manoeuvring handles (28) at the side of the saw and having activating switches.
