<ABSTRACT>
An encoder includes an electrically 
conductive reference scale having surface steps formed 

at predetermined positions; an electrically conductive 
probe having a tip disposed opposed to the reference 

scale; wherein the reference scale and the probe are 
relatively movable in a direction different from the 

opposing direction of the tip of the probe and the 
reference scale; a portion for applying an electric 

voltage to between the reference scale and the probe; 
a portion for detecting a change in a tunnel current 

between the reference scale and the probe, to between 
which the electric voltage is applied by the voltage 

applying portion at the time of the relative movement 
between the scale and the probe, the detecting portion 

detecting the change in the tunnel current when the 
probe passes a position opposed to a surface step of 

the reference scale; and portion for detecting the 
amount of the relative movement between the scale and 

probe, on the basis of the detection by the change 
detecting portion.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to an encoder for use
in the detection of positional information upon fine
positioning, dimension measurement, distance measurement,
velocity measurement or otherwise. More
particularly, it is concerned with an encoder for use
in the measurement control for which resolution of an
order of atoms (a few angstroms) is required.Usually, encoders of the type described
comprises a reference scale, which bears information
related to the position or angle, and detecting means
movable relatively to the reference scale, for
detecting the information related to the position or
angle. In respect to the reference scale and the
detecting means used, the encoders may be classified
into different types, e.g., optical encoders, magnetic
encoders, electrostatic capacitance type encoders, etc.Of these encoders, those that assure highest
resolution are optical encoders which use, for example,
the principle of grating interference. Figure 1 shows
the structure of a known type optical encoder. In this
example, light source 3001 emits a monochromatic light
3002 which is projected upon diffraction grating 3003
that functions as a reference scale. Of the light
diffracted by the grating, positive and negative first-order 
diffraction light components 3004 and 3005 are
directed by reflection mirrors 3006 to enter into a
half mirror 3007. By this half mirror 3007, the
diffraction light components are combined and, thus,
there occurs interference. Interference fringe caused
thereby is detected and photoelectrically converted by
photodetector 3008. In this manner, the relative
displacement between the optical system and the
reference scale is detected on the basis of the
interference fringe.In the grating interference type optical
encoders, having the highest resolution as compared
with those of the other encoders described above, the
performance (resolution) is determined chiefly by the
pitch of the grating. Thus, how to precisely fabricate
the grating with minute pitch and how to precisely
detect it are important factors. Current fine
machining technique (for example, electron beam pattern
drawing technique or ion beam technique) can at the
best assure the precision of 0.01 micron (100
angstroms). Also, in the detecting technique (for
example, optical heterodyne method), the resolution is
limited to 0.01 micron. Therefore, it is difficult to
satisfy the requirement of higher resolution encoder,
particularly for use in a semiconductor microcircuit
manufacturing apparatus. Document JP 62 209 302 discloses an
