<ABSTRACT>
Prior art cross-country ski shovels have only simple curvature and thus always make an angle of about 90 DEG  to the sides of the tracks. When a conventional cross-country ski shovel comes into contact with the track, the shear resistance forces and the snow pushed by this shearing action into the tracks reduce the speed of the skier. The use of ski shovels with dual curvature as proposed by the invention converts the shear resistance forces into lower sliding resistance forces, considerably reduces the amount of snow pushed into the tracks when the skis make contact with the track walls, thus increasing the potential speed of the skier. The fact that the track walls and the dual-curvature running surface of the ski shovel make contact tangentially improves ski control and significantly reduces the danger of falling.
