<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a lightening element for floors and 
staging of reinforced concrete (this material being indicated 
hereinafter as r.c. in the usual manner). One example of floors comprising lightening elements is the known 
floors formed from lattice slabs, consisting of prefabricated 
rectangular r.c. slabs in which reinforcement lattices formed from 
steel rods are partially embedded during the slab prefabrication, 
the lattices being arranged parallel to two sides of the slab at a 
predetermined distance between axes. When these lattice slabs 
have been installed side by side, corresponding rows of modular 
lightening elements, normally polystyrene or tile blocks, are 
arranged between the lattices of the individual slab. The floor 
is then completed with a concrete casting of suitable thickness 
covering the entire assembly. When the concrete has set a 
monolithic floor is obtained in which said lightening elements 
remain incorporated. As a substitute for these latter, channel-shaped 
electric welded meshes clad with a plastics sheet have been 
proposed, these channels being arranged between two adjacent 
lattices with their concavity facing downwards, so that when the 
finishing casting has been laid a sort of lightening tunnel is 
obtained. Another type of floor or staging comprising lightening elements of 
one of the said types is that in which r.c. is cast in situ to 
form a lower plate and an upper plate spaced apart from each other 
and connected together by a series of parallel ribs or two series  
 
of crossed ribs, the lightening elements remaining trapped between 
the two plates. All the aforesaid floors have various drawbacks, including: 
the cost of currently used lightening elements; the fact that the polystyrene or tile blocks absorb the water 
contained in the concrete casting, which water can remain stagnant 
within the floor for a considerable time, with all the serious 
deriving problems; in the case of in-situ cast double plate floors or staging, 
the need to make the casting in two stages at least twentyfour 
hours apart to allow sufficient setting of the lower plate in 
order to be able to arrange the polystyrene blocks on it means 
that steel connectors have to be positioned projecting from the 
first plate to achieve a monolithic floor, with the cost that this 
involves; in the case of polystyrene blocks, the difficulty of 
maintaining them in position while laying the finishing casting; the fact that in the case of fire the polystyrene produces 
toxic gases even
