<ABSTRACT>
In the numerical contouring control method for multiple axis machines, contour control data (X, Y) in tabular form are stored for selected precalculated points of a workpiece contour (C). A one-dimensional, axis-independent point (Z1...Zn) is assigned to each contour control datum (X, Y). The contour control values can be logically linked with weighting factors (a...e) to correct the geometrical tool wear. The compensation of the position deviations is ensured by means of correction values (X', X'', Y') stored in correction tables (K', K'').

Method for numerical continuous-path control
of multi-axis machines, having the following steps:


1.1 for a path line which is to be travelled over
by the machine, continuous-path control data (X, Y) are

determined at selected and/or precalculated positions
and stored in a memory (H),
1.2 there is allocated to each related set of
continuous-path control data a one-dimensional pointer

(Z1 ... Zn),
1.3 in order to control the path line, the
continuous-path control data (X, Y) are called up by

input of a pointer-value sequence (Z1 ... Zn),

   characterised by the following further steps,

1.4 there is added to each item of continuous-path
control data (X, Y) in a pointer-value-related

manner as many correction values (X', X", Y', Y") as
there are error variables to be taken into account,
1.4 each item of continuous-path control data (X,
Y) and each correction value (X', X", Y', Y") can be

combined with a weighting variable (a, b, c, d, e),
1.5 the weighted continuous-path control data (X,
Y) are output as manipulated variables (SX, SY) to the

continuous-path control devices of the axes involved,
1.5 for periodically recurring axis movements,
the continuous-path control data (X, Y) with the

associated pointers (Z1 ... Zn) are plottable only for
one period and the successive periods are generated by

addition of the continuous-path control data (X, Y) of
the pointer value (Zn) which is last in each case to

the first pointer value (Z1).
Method according to claim 1, characterised in
that additional continuous-path control data are

determined by interpolation between two successive
pointer values (ZI, ZI+1).
