<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a system (1) for carrying a light weapon (2), comprising a rigid support plate (4), a locking device (20) for blocking the weapon (2) against the support plate (4), and at least one strapping band (40). The locking device (20) comprises a manually controlled movable finger (21) and an elastic member for the return of the said finger (21) into a blocking position, in which it is accommodated in a groove (23) of the weapon (2) in order to block the latter against the support plate (4). The movable finger (21) is operated automatically by the finger of the hand of the fitet when he grasps his weapon in order to release the locking finger (21) from the groove (23). The invention is used particularly in a light weapon, such as an automatic pistol or a submachine gun.
