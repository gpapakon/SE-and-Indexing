<ABSTRACT>
The flange fastens pipes (1) to an engine block. It has a sealing plate (2), with an aperture (4) for each pipe. The sealing plate is connected to a hood (5), which has apertures coinciding with those in the sealing plate. Hood and plate enclose a sealed hollow chamber (8). Plate and cover have aligned fastening bores (3,9). They may be welded or soldered to each other. The hood is formed as a deep drawn part. It engages flat on the plate, esp. along the edge. The sealing plate has an aperture (12) into the chamber, and the hood has a socket, which also extends into the chamber. The pipe is fastened to plate and hood.
