<ABSTRACT>
2.1 Stepped mould inserts are produced using structured irradiation masks with X-ray absorption which varies from area to area; to this end, extensive calculations are necessary. Furthermore, a plurality of masks can be used one after the other and the penetration depth of the X-rays varied for each exposure step; these masks must be positioned with high precision. The novel process allows the production of stepped mould inserts in a simple manner. 2.2 The areas of a structured resist layer which have been produced lithographically and bared by development are filled with metal on a flat plate. The layer is removed mechanically to the prespecified thickness. After the remainder of the resist has been dissolved out, this procedure is repeated a number of times, if desired. The bared areas in the resist layer applied last are filled with metal and covered and separated from the resist layer, giving the multistep metallic mould insert. 2.3 Production of microstructure elements of high precision having a multistepped structure.
