<ABSTRACT>
A high-speed information service system is provided which uses 
Primary Rate Interface 

(PRI) Integrated Services Digital Networks (ISDN) signaling and 
temporary, "out-of-band" 

signaling to improve information retrieval capability. ISDN signaling 
permits electronic 

addressing of information requested by the subscriber, thereby 
eliminating the delays which 

accompany DTMF signal processing. Communications between an 
information service provider (110,112,108) 

and an individual information source are conducted using out-of-band 
signaling. That is, call 

setup and information request are processed using a channel other 
than the channel which 

carries data between the information service provider, the information 
source and the subscriber.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to information services systems and, more particularly, to
information services systems which process information requests received via telephone lines.Currently available information services systems permit a subscriber to the service to
obtain information about subscriber-selected topics, such as weather, sports, and stock prices.
Several systems enable the subscriber to access the desired information in real-time, via
telephone lines. Typically, the subscriber requests information by entering keystrokes from a
telephone keypad to transmit a sequence of dual-tone multifrequency (DTMF) telephone signals.
The DTMF tones are received at a central processor operated by an information service
provider. The information service provider then places one or more telephone calls to various
information sources, also via DTMF signaling, to obtain the requested information. The
information service provider then transmits the requested information back to the subscriber.Information retrieval systems which use DTMF signaling to communicate between the
information service provider and the information sources suffer several performance
disadvantages. In particular, the subscriber must endure long delays while the information
service provider obtains the requested information from the information sources. The
information retrieval process is slow because specifying information to be retrieved typically
may require transmission of twenty five or thirty DTMF tones for each element of information 
requested. In-band DTMF signaling between the information service provider and the
various information sources results in further delays because call setup and other control
signals can pass between the information service provider and the information sources
only when information is not being delivered to the subscriber.EP-A-0127 138 describes a conventional telecommunications
information services system.According to the present invention, there is provided a method as defined
in claim 1 or apparatus as defined in claim 10. A high-speed information service system is provided which overcomes the deficiencies
of the prior art by using Integrated Services Digital Networks (ISDN) signaling and temporary,
"out-of-band" signaling to improve information retrieval capability. ISDN signaling eliminates
the need for DTMF signaling within the information service provider's network, thereby
avoiding the delays which accompany DTMF signal processing. Communications between the
information service provider and the
