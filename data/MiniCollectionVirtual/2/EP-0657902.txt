<ABSTRACT>
A horizontal linearity correction coil is used 
for a television receiver having a cathode ray tube of a 

wide deflection angle and has excellent productivity, 
quality and loading respectively. The ferrite magnetic 

core has the flanges (16, 17 and 18) at both ends and the 
middle and has a hollow shape at one winding core portion 

(19) of the ferrite magnetic core. The windings (22 and 
23) are wound around the winding core portions (19 and 

20) and the permanent magnets (24 and 25) are combined to 
both end flanges (16 and 18).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a horizontal 
linearity correction coil to be used for a television 
receiver or the like. In a television receiver using a cathode ray 
tube which has a wide deflection angle of 112 degrees and 
which has a plane fluorescent screen called a flat face, 
when a lattice-shaped cross hatch pattern 1 is displayed 
on the screen as shown in Fig. 4, a distortion occurs to 
widen the distance in the horizontal direction of the 
screen as shown by 1a and 1b at portions between the 
center and the left end portion and between the center 
and the right end portion of the screen. As shown in Fig. 5, a horizontal deflection 
current 2a is linear with respect to time t (that is, 
this current shows a constant change rate with the change 
of time), and cathode rays (electron beams) of a cathode 
ray tube 3 shown in Fig. 6 are electromagnetically 
deflected at a constant angle ( a1 = a2 = a3 = a4). 
Since the fluorescent screen of the cathode ray tube 3 is 
plane, the displayed positional dimensions of the 
fluorescent screen of the cathode ray tube 3 become 
la1 ≠ la2 ≠ la3 ≠ la4 .  
 In order to correct this distortion, first and 
second linearity correction coils 6 and 7 are connected 
in series to a horizontal deflection coil 5 which is 
connected to a horizontal deflection output circuit 4 and 
a capacitor 8 is connected to this second horizontal 
linearity correction coil 7 so as to form a horizontal 
deflection circuit as the circuit is shown in Fig. 7. Fig. 8 shows the electrical characteristics of 
the first and second horizontal linearity correction 
coils 6 and 7. The characteristic of the first 
horizontal linearity correction coil 6 is designated by L6 
and the characteristic of the second horizontal linearity 
correction coil 7 is designated by L7. The characteristic 
L6 of the first horizontal linearity correction coil 6 
shows a peak value of inductance in the middle between 
"0" of a horizontal deflection current IH and a maximum 
value at the minus side. The characteristic L7 of the 
second horizontal linearity correction coil 7 shows a 
peak value of inductance in the middle between "0" of the 
horizontal deflection current IH and a maximum value at 
the plus side. Thus, the peak value of the characteristic 
L6 is larger than the peak value of the characteristic 
L7. In order to obtain a characteristic designated 
by L8, by combining the characteristic L6 and the 
characteristic L7, the first and second horizontal 
linearity correction coils 6 and 7 are connected
