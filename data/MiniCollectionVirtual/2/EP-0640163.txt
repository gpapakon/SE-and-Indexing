<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to office panelling 
systems and, in particular, relates to methods of 
interconnecting office panels. Office panelling systems typically are designed about 
individual office panels which can be interconnected and 
joined to subdivide what would otherwise be an open space. 
Initially, individual free-standing panels were used, however, 
integrated panelling systems now also serve as passageways for 
conduits, for power and communications wiring, as well as for 
supporting office components such as desks, filing cabinets, 
etc. The interconnected panelling systems typically rely on 
the series of connected panels for stability. 'T' junctions 
of panels typically occur at a junction of panel ends and 
various connections methods have been proposed at such a 
junction. A junction intermediate a panel length is difficult 
to interconnect and causes problems with passage of wires 
between panels. Although a 'T' shaped junction is the most 
typical, other angled junctions are used. Panelling systems are designed to allow for both 
flexibility in initial design as well as flexibility in 
changing the design should the needs of the space change in 
the future. One such design is shown in United States Patent 
4,120,124. In this system, the panels are joined at the ends. There remains a need for a panelling system having 
improved flexibility. An office panelling system according to the present 
invention has a plurality of interconnected panels where 
adjacent panels are rigidly connected by means of a 
structural connection therebetween. Each panel has a frame 
with a plurality of horizontal members extending in the  
 
length of the panel with each horizontal member having a 
slot extending in the length of the member. Each slot is 
accessible at an exterior face of the panel. At least some 
of the panels are arranges to form angled panels which are 
connected at an angle to one another and intermediate a 
length of one of the angled panels. The angled panels are 
positively secured by means of securing arrangements where 
each securing arrangement releasably engages opposed 
horizontal slots of the angled panels and locks therewith. 
Each securing arrangement includes at a first end thereof a 
first engaging member for receipt in the opposed slot of 
one of the angled panels and a locking member for movement 
from a position accommodating placement of the first 
engaging member in the slot of the panel to a position 
cooperating with the horizontal member to fixedly retain 
the

<CLAIMS>
An office panelling system (2) having a plurality 
of interconnected panels (6) where adjacent panels are 

rigidly connected by means of a structural connection (20) 
therebetween, each panel having a frame (10) with a 

plurality of horizontal members (40) extending in the 
length of said panel (6), characterized in that
 
   each horizontal member (40) has a slot (8) 

extending in the length of said member which slot is 
accessible at an exterior face of said panel (6); at least 

some of said panels (6) forming angled panels (6) which are 
connected at an angle to one another and intermediate a 

length of one of said angled panels (6), said angled panels 
(6) being positively secured by means of securing 

arrangements (20) where each securing arrangement (20) 
releasably engages opposed horizontal slots (8) of said 

angled panels (6) and locks therewith, each securing 
arrangement (20) comprising at a first end thereof a first 

engaging member (22) for receipt in the opposed slot of one 
of said angled panels and a locking member (26) for 

movement from a position accommodating placement of said 
first engaging member (22) in said slot (8) to a position 

cooperating with said horizontal member (40) to fixedly 
retain said first engaging member (22) in said slot (8), 

each securing arrangement (20) including at a second end 
thereof a second engaging member (22) and locking member 

(26) for engaging the slot (8) in the other panel (6) of 
said angled panels to form a strong mechanical connection 

therebetween. 
An office panelling system as claimed in claim 1 
wherein said first engaging member and said second engaging 

member (22) each has an offset flange (22) for engaging one 
of said slots (8) of said panels (6) and each locking 

member (26) is of variable thickness which cooperates with  
 

said horizontal member (40) in a wedging manner for fixedly 
securing said respective engaging member (22) in a slot (8) 

of said panels (6). 
An office panelling system (2) as claimed in claim 
1 or 2 wherein each slot (8) is open on one side,and closed 

at the top (46) and bottom (44) and each locking member 
(26) engages said slot (8) to wedge said respective 

engaging member (22) in said slot (8). 
An office panelling system (2) as claimed in claim 
3 wherein each slot (8) is closed on one side (48) and has 

a lower rail (40) with an upturn for engaging a downwardly 
extending flange (22) at one end of said engaging members 

(22), and wherein each locking member is a cam (26) which 
engages both the top (46) and closed side (48) of said slot 

(8) and forces said downwardly extending flange (22) into 
pressure contact with said upturn of said lower rail (40). 
An office panelling system (2) as claimed in claim 
1 wherein said angled panels (6) are connected at two 

horizontal positions. 
An office panelling system (2) as claimed in claim 
1 wherein said angled panels (6) are connected at two 

horizontal positions and wherein said horizontal positions 
are each intermediate the height of said respective panels 

(6). 
An office panelling system (2) as claimed in claim 
1 wherein each panel (6) has horizontal members (40) which 

are vertically spaced approximately 38 cm (15 inches). 
An office panelling system (2) as claimed in claim 
7 wherein said securing arrangements (20) fixedly secure 

said angled panels (6) at a predetermined angular 
orientation.  

 
An office panelling system (2) as claimed in claim 
8 wherein each slot (8) is closed on one side (48) and said 

locking member (26) is a cam which engages both the top 
(46) and closed side (48) of said slot (8). 
An office panelling system (2) as claimed in claim 
9 wherein each slot (8) has a lower rail (40) behind which 

a downwardly extending end flange (22) of an engaging 
member (22) is located. 
An office panelling system as claimed in claim 1 
wherein said frame (10) of each panel (6) has said 

horizontal slots (8) for receiving one of said securing 
arrangements (20) at about 15 cm (6 inches) above a lower edge of 

said frame (10) and intervals of 38 cm (15 inches) thereafter. 
An office panelling system (2) as claimed in any 
preceding claim wherein each office panel has a series of 

cover elements (12) supported by said frame with said slots 
(8) accessible between adjacent cover elements (12).
