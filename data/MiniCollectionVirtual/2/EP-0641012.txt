<ABSTRACT>
The present invention relates to an electron-optical imaging system, in particular for electron microscopes, having magnetic lenses (11-14, 16-19), associated current or voltage sources (20-29), a computer (31), a hard disk memory (32) and an operating panel (7). During commissioning, the electron microscope is calibrated (adjusted, corrected) manually in a discrete sequence of different operating conditions. Second-degree polynomials are matched to the parameter values, calibrated experimentally, for the lens currents. The calculated polynomial coefficients are stored in the disk memory (32). Operating states can be set via a keyboard panel (7) at the operating console of the electron microscope, which operating states lie between the calibrated operating conditions. The lens currents required in these operating states are calculated in the computer (31) using the function coefficients stored in the memory (32) and are subsequently issued by the computer (31) to the current sources (21-29). The step size (spacing) in which the operating states can be set can in this case be preselected via a keyboard (5) and independently of the position of the calibrated operating conditions.

Electron-optical imaging system comprising a plurality controllable elements (11, 12,
13, 14, 16, 17, 18, 19) with corresponding current or voltage sources (21, 22, 23, 24,

26, 27, 28), a memory (32) and a computer (31), whereby values are stored in the
memory which are determined from experimentally adjusted parameter values of the

imaging system in a discret series of different adjusted operating conditions, whereby
a step width 6 for changing the operating conditions is selectable independently of

the position of the adjusted operating conditions and whereby, when operating a
control element (7a, 7b), starting from the actual adjusted operating condition a

change of the operating condition according to the selected step width 6 into a new
actual operating condition is performed, for which the control signals of the current

and voltage sources (21, 22, 23, 24, 26, 27, 28, 29) corresponding to the actual
adjusted operating condition are calculated from the stored values by the computer

(31).
Electron-optical imaging system of claim 1, whereby the stored values are
coefficients of approximation functions and whereby the control signals are

calculated by the aid of these coefficients and the corresponding approximation
functions.
Electron-optical imaging system of claim 2, wherein the approximation functions
each are steady functions in an interval and whereby the intervals in which each two

approximation functions are steady are mutually overlapping.
Electron-optical imaging system of claim 2 or 3, whereby the approximation
functions are polynomes of second degree.
Electron-optical imaging system of one of the claims 1 to 4, whereby the elements
(11, 12, 13, 14, 16, 17, 18, 19) acting on the electron beam are magnetic lenses.
Electron-microscope comprising an electron-optical imaging system of one of the
claims 1 to 5. 
Electron-microscope of claim 6, whereby the operating conditions are changeable at
the operating console (2) of the electron microscope.
Electron-microscope of claim 7, whereby the operating conditions are changeable by
the aid of a touch panel (7) at the operating console (2) of the electron microscope.
Electron-microscope of one of the claims 6 to 8, with at least one imaging system
(11, 12, 13, 14) between an electron source (10) and a sample plane (15) and a

second imaging system (14, 16, 17, 18, 19) between the sample plane (15) and a
projection plane (30) and wherein the first and second imaging systems are coupled

one to the other so that with a change of the operating conditions of the second
imaging system (14, 16, 17, 18, 19) also the operating conditions of the first imaging

system (11, 12, 13, 14) are changed in a manner that the brightness of the image in
the projection plane (30) is constant.
