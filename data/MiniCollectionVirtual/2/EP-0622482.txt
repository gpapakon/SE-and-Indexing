<ABSTRACT>
When a residual amount 
R
 of a roving required to make a 
bobbin full at a desired stopping position 
A
 of the bobbin 
rail which moves upwardly is smaller than the amount (4Ã—L) 

corresponding to remaining four layers of the roving for a 
normal winding process, a desired amount Q is calculated as 

the residual amount 
R
 divided by 4. The switching of the 
roving during the downward movement of the bobbin rail is 

done when the amount of the roving from the top end of the 
bobbin rail is equal to the desired spinning amount Q. This 

operation is repeated until a full bobbin amount is detected 
by an encoder, and the flyer frame is stopped.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method and 
apparatus for controlling the winding of a roving in a flyer 
frame, where the roving from a front roller is wound on a 
roving bobbin, while the direction of the movement of a 
bobbin rail is alternately switched. In a spinning factory, flyer frames produce roving 
bobbins, which are conveyed to fine spinning frames, where 
the roving from the bobbins are subjected to a fine spinning 
process for producing spun yarns on cops, while emptied 
roving bobbins at the fine spinning frames are returned back 
to the flyer frames for re-use. Various automated operations 
have been developed in this field. Namely, in order to obtain 
an automated conveyance of full bobbins from the flyer frames 
to the fine spinning frames and of empty bobbins from the 
fine spinning frames to the flyer frames, a system has 
proposed, wherein a rail conveyor is provided for conveying 
full bobbins, being carried by bobbin carriages in a 
suspended condition, from the flyer frames to auxiliary rails 
of creels of the fine spinning frames, almost emptied bobbins 
held by the creels are replaced by the conveyed full bobbins, 
while rovings from the full bobbins are pieced to respective 
ends of rovings supplied to respective spinning units of the 
fine spinning frames, a roving stripper is provided for 
stripping residual roving on the almost emptied bobbins after 
the replacement, and the completely emptied bobbins are 
returned to the flyer frames for re-use. In this system, the piecing of the full bobbins can 
be automatically executed as disclosed by Japanese Un-Examined 
Un-Examined Patent Publication No. 62-53425 and Japanese 
Patent Publication No. 64-52828. In such an 
automated piecing apparatus, an end of the roving on a bobbin  
 
is found and held by an air sucker, and a end of the roving 
shaped as a pointed brush shape is, while being held by a 
nipper, moved so as to be contacted with a roving supplied to 
a spinning unit from the almost emptied bobbin. A 
disengagement of the nipper causes the roving end of the full 
bobbin to be freed, causing it to be entrained by the 
supplied roving from the almost emptied bobbin to the 
spinning unit, thereby the roving from the full bobbin to be 
pieced to the roving from the emptied bobbin. Finally, the 
roving from the almost emptied bobbin is broken. In order to 
execute this kind of the piecing properly, it is required 
that the end of the roving in a full bobbin should be located 
on a predetermined vertical position, which

wherein the roving issued from a front roller (16) of a draft part (10) 

is taken up by a bobbin (24) on a bobbin rail (20), which is normally 
reciprocated between vertically spaced locations to create a 

package of the roving (19) with vertically spaced shoulders (24-1, 24-2), and 
the bobbin rail (20) is stopped at a desired vertical location 

when a predetermined amount of the roving is wound on the 
bobbin (24), the method comprising the steps of:

roving (19) issued from the front roller (16); 
providing means (S7-S12) of obtaining a switching of 
the movement of the bobbin rail (20) which is different from said 

normal reciprocating movement; generating a signal for stoppage of the flyer 
frame when a predetermined full amount (D) of the roving is 

wound on the bobbin (24) from an empty state of the bobbin,

full bobbin condition minus the actual amount (d) of the roving 
on the bobbin measured by the measuring means (100); 
determining a condition where the calculated 
residual amount (R) is equal to or less than the amount (4xL) of the 

roving (19) corresponding to layers of a first predetermined 
number during the normal winding process;

the calculated residual amount (R), a modified amount (Q) of the 

roving for layers of a second predetermined number until the 
full bobbin state is obtained, each of which corresponds to a 

stroke of the bobbin rail (20) from a shoulder location, exceeding 
said desired vertical location for the stoppage and which 

makes the end of the roving (19) to be situated on said desired 
location for the stoppage when the full bobbin state is 

obtained;
