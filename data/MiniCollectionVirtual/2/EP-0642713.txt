<ABSTRACT>
In a circuit for deriving a signal indicating interference in a received stereo multiplex signal, in which the stereo multiplex signal is in the form of a digital signal with a first scanning rate which is substantially greater than twice the upper limit of the useful frequency range of the stereo multiplex signal, the received stereo multiplex signal is taken via a high-pass filter. The high-pass-filtered stereo multiplex signal is subjected to decimation at a second scanning rate which is greater than twice the upper limit of the useful frequency range of the stereo multiplex signal.

<CLAIMS>
Circuit arrangement for deriving a signal which
indicates interference in a received stereo multiplex

signal, the stereo multiplex signal being present as a
digital signal with a first sampling rate, which is

significantly greater than twice the upper limit of the
useful frequency range of the stereo multiplex signal,

characterized in that the received stereo multiplex
signal is conducted via a high-pass filter (6) and in

that the high-pass-filtered stereo multiplex signal is
subjected to a decimation (7) to a second sampling

rate, which is greater than twice the upper limit of
the useful frequency range of the stereo multiplex

signal.
Circuit arrangement according to Claim 1,
characterized in that the received stereo multiplex

signal is furthermore conducted via a low-pass filter
(3), and in that the low-pass-filtered stereo multiplex

signal is subjected to a decimation (2) to the second
sampling rate.
Circuit arrangement according to Claim 2,
characterized in that the low-pass filter (3) has a

frequency response that falls gradually within the
useful frequency range.
Circuit arrangement according to Claim 3,
characterized in that the low-pass-filtered stereo

multiplex signal with the second sampling rate passes
through a filter (4) in order to compensate for the

falling frequency response of the low-pass filter (3), 
and in that the output signal of the filter (4) can be

fed, for the purpose of compensation, via a circuit
(15) for interference suppression, which can be

controlled by the signal which indicates interference,
to a stereo decoder (16).
Circuit arrangement according to one of the
preceding claims, characterized in that the first

sampling rate is 456 kHz and the second sampling rate
is 228 kHz.
