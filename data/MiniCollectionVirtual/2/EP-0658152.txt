<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a preparation of a concrete having a compression resistance of at least 400 MPa and a fracturation energy of at least 1 000 J/m
<

>
. A mix containing substantially cement, fine sand, amorphous silica, crushed quartz, steel wool, a fluidifying agent and water in specific proportions is mixed and, after setting, the concrete is fired at a temperature of at least 250  DEG C. The figure is a micrography showing the microstructure of concrete according to the invention. The invention provides particularly for the making of concrete parts in replacement of steel, for example anchoring heads for prestressed cables.

not less than 400 MPa and fracture energy of not less than 

1,000 J/m

, characterized in that it includes operations consisting 
in mixing a mixture comprising the following proportions expressed in 

parts by weight (p): 

a) 100 p of Portland cement; 
b) 30 p to 100 p or better 40 p to 70 p of fine sand having a 
grain size of not less than 150 micrometers; 
c) 10 p to 40 p or better 20 p to 30 p of amorphous silicon 
having a grain size of less than 0.5 micrometers; 
d) 20 p to 60 p or better 30 p to 50 p of ground quartz having 
a grain size of less than 10 micrometers; 
e) 25 p to 100 p, or better 45 p to 80 p of steel fibers; 
f) a thinning agent; 
g) optionally other additives; 
h) 13 p to 26 p or better 15 p to 22 p of water; 
 
   and, once the mixture has set, the concrete is cured at a 

temperature of not less than 250°C for a period of time sufficient to 
transform the cement hydration products into crystalline hydrates of 

the xonotlite type, so as to eliminate substantially all of the free 
water, and so as to eliminate at least the major part of the absorbed 

and chemically bonded water. 
A method according to claim 1, characterized in that the fine sand 
has a grain size less than 800 micrometers. 
A method according to claim 2, characterized in that the fine sand 
has a grain size in the range 150 micrometers to 400 microm
eters. 
A method according to any one of claims 1 to 3, characterized in 
that a steel fiber is used constituted by steel chips ground to 1 mm 

to 5 mm (size of the cutting grid of the grinder). 
A method according to claim 1 or 4, characterized in that a 
stainless steel fiber is used.  

 
A method according to claim 5, characterized in that said mixture 
contains not less than 0.6 p, or better still not less than 1.4 p by 

weight of a superplasticizer.

micrometers, and preferably in the range 100 micrometers to 200 
micrometers, and the volume of said fibers lying in the range 1% to 

4%, or better in the range 2% to 3% of the volume of the concrete 
after setting.

Portland cement: 50 p of sand, 23 p of silica, 39 p of quartz, 2 p of 
super plasticizer, 63 p of steel fibers, and 18 p of water. 
A method according to any one of claims 1 to 8, characterized in

or better to a temperature of not less than 400°C, at ambient 
pressure and at ambient humidity. 
A method according to any one of claims 1 to 9, characterized in 
that the fresh concrete is subjected, while setting, to a pressure of 

not less than 5 MPa, or better to a pressure of not less than 50 MPa.
