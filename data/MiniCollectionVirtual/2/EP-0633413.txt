<ABSTRACT>
Seal made of water-swelling material, such as, for example, an arch stone seal or construction joint seal, characterised in that it comprises a core (10) consisting of a web or sheet (14) of substantially inextensible material, such as a fabric for example, located within a backing layer (12) of non water-swelling material and a layer (16) of water-swelling material on each of the faces of the core (10).

<CLAIMS>
A sealing gasket of water-swelling material, such as a gasket for 
a tunnel-lining voussoir segment or for repairing concrete, the 

gasket being characterized in that it comprises a core (10) made of a 
sheet (14) of substantially inextensible material disposed in a 

support layer of non-water-swelling natural or synthetic rubber. 
A gasket according to claim 1, characterized in that said core 
(10) is coated with a surface layer (16) of water-swelling material 

on at least one of its faces, and preferably on both of them. 
A gasket according to claim 1 or 2, characterized in that said 
sheet (14) of inextensible material is a textile material. 
A gasket according to claim 3, characterized in that said sheet of 
inextensible material is a close- or wide-meshed woven cloth, e.g. of 

polyester or of cotton. 
A gasket according to any preceding claim, characterized in that 
it is made by hot calendaring, followed by vulcanizing superposed 

layers (16, 12) of water-swelling material and of non-water-swelling 
material, and a sheet (14) of non-extensible material. 
A gasket according to any one of claims 1 to 4, characterized in 
that it is made by co-extrusion.
