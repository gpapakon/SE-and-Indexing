<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to certain substituted 
derivatives, in particular, certain 1-pyrimidinylacetamide compounds, 
which are inhibitors of human leukocyte elastase (HLE), also known as 
human neutrophil elastase (HNE), making them useful whenever such 
inhibition is desired, such as for research tools in pharmacological, 
diagnostic and related studies and in the treatment of diseases in 
mammals in which HLE is implicated. For example, HLE has been 
implicated in the pathogenesis of acute respiratory distress syndrome 
(ARDS), rheumatoid arthritis, atherosclerosis, pulmonary emphysema, 
and other inflammatory disorders, including airway inflammatory 
diseases characterized by increased and abnormal airway secretion such 
as chronic bronchitis and cystic fibrosis. Also, HLE has been 
implicated in certain vascular diseases and related conditions (and 
their therapy) in which neutrophil participation is involved or 
implicated, for example, in hemorrhage associated with acute 
non-lymphocytic leukemia, as well as in reperfusion injury associated 
with, for example, myocardial ischaemia and related conditions 
associated with coronary artery disease such as angina and infarction, 
cerebrovascular ischaemia such as transient ischaemic attack and 
stroke, peripheral occlusive vascular disease such as intermittent 
claudication and critical limb ischaemia, venous insufficiency such as 
venous hypertension, varicose veins and venous ulceration, as well as 
impaired reperfusion states such as those associated with 
reconstructive vascular surgery, thrombolysis and angioplasty. The 
invention also includes intermediates useful in the synthesis of these 
substituted derivatives, processes for preparing the substituted 
derivatives, pharmaceutical compositions containing such substituted 
derivatives and methods for their use. In U.S. Patent 4,499,082, of 12 February 1985, assigned to 
E. I. DuPont De Nemours and Company, there is disclosed a series of 
peptidyl boronic acid derivatives as reversible inhibitors of 
proteolytic enzymes, including HLE. It is well known that boronic 
acid derivatives, such as for example the a corresponding esters, 
readily may be hydrolyzed under the in vitro and in vivo conditions in  
 
which they are tested and used. 
European Patent Application, Publication No. 0528633 discloses certain 
pyrimidinyl acetamides as elastase inhibitors. U.S. Patent 4.963,655 
discloses certain boronic acid analogues of amino acids, dipeptides and 
tripeptides and their use in inhibiting
