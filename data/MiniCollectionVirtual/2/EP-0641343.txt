<DESCRIPTION>
Enkephalinase or, more specifically, endopeptidase-24.11,
is a mammalian ectoenzyme which is involved in the
metabolic degradation of certain circulating regulatory
peptides. This enzyme, which is a Zn+2-metallopeptidase,
exerts its effect by cleaving the extracellular peptides at
the amino group of hydrophobic residues and thus
inactivates the peptides as regulatory messengers.Enkephalinase is involved in the metabolic degradation
of a variety of circulating regulatory peptides including
endorphins, such as β-endorphin and the enkephalins, atrial
natriuretic peptide (ANP), bradykinin and other circulating
regulatory peptides.Endorphins are naturally-occurring polypeptides which
bind to opiate receptors in various areas of the brain and
thereby provide an analgesic effect by raising the pain
threshold. Endorphins occur in various forms including α-endorphin,
β-endorphin, γ-endorphin as well as the
enkephalins. The enkephalins, i.e., Met-enkephalin and Leuenkephalin,
are pentapeptides which occur in nerve endings
of brain tissue, spinal cord and the gastrointestinal tract.
Like the other endorphins, the enkephalins provide an
analgesic effect by binding to the opiate receptors in the 
brain. By inhibiting enkephalinase, the metabolic
degradation of the naturally-occurring endorphins and
enkephalins is inhibited, thereby providing a potent
endorphin- or enkephalin-mediated analgesic effect.
Inhibition of enkephalinase would therefore be useful in a
patient suffering from acute or chronic pain. Inhibition of
enkephalinase would also be useful in providing an
antidepressant effect and in providing a reduction in
severity of withdrawal symptoms associated with termination
of opiate or morphine administration.ANP refers to a family of naturally-occurring peptides
which are involved in the homeostatic regulation of blood
pressure, as well as sodium and water levels. ANPs have
been found to vary in length from about 21 to about 126
amino acids with a common structural feature being one or
more disulfide-looped sequences of 17 amino acids with
various amino- and carboxy-terminal sequences attached to
the cystine moiety. ANPs have been found to bind to
specific binding sites in various tissues including kidney,
adrenal, aorta, and vascular smooth muscle with affinities
ranging from about 50 pico-molar (pM) to about 500 nanomolar
(nM) [Needleman, Hypertension7, 469 (1985)]. In
addition, it is believed that ANP binds to specific
receptors in the brain and possibly serves as a
neuromodulator as well as a
