<DESCRIPTION>
* 5 DELIGNIFYING PREPARATION EXHIBITING g-L-ARABINOFURANOSIDASE ACTIVITY. PRODUCTION AND APPLICATION THEREOFThe invention relates to a preparation exhibiting enzymatic activity comprising a substantial portion of α-L-arabinofurano-10 sidase activity having the capability of delignifying wood pulp at a pH of 8 - 9 and a temperature of 65°C. Further, it relates to a method of producing said preparation by aerobic fermenta¬ tion of a selected Bacillus stearothermophilus strain. The invention also comprises said selected strain. Moreover, it15 relates to a process comprising treatment of wood pulp with a preparation of the invention and also wood pulp that has been treated with said preparation. Additionally, it relates to the use of an enzyme expressed by the deposited Bacillus stearother¬ mophilus strain NCIMB 40494 in the treatment of wood pulp. Also,20 it relates to α-L-arabinofuranosidase having an amino acid sequence which comprises one or two specified partial amino acid sequences or homologues thereof.BACKGROUND25Due to environmental reasons, the pulp and paper industry has shown increasing interest in bleaching sequences aiming at delignification and bleaching of pulp without use of any chlorine-containing compounds.30To that end, many patent applications disclosing new enzymes for delignification of pulp have been filed recently. One such application is our WO 91/10724 (Swedish priority application was * issued as patent on December 19, 1991), which i.a. claims a 35 preparation exhibiting enzymatic activity and having the capability of delignifying wood pulp at a temperature of at least 65°C and a pH of at least 9. Said preparation is obtain¬ able by aerobic fermentation of a Bacillus stearothermophilus strain having the capability of producing said preparation, such 

as one of the two deposited strains NCIMB 40221 or NCIMB 40222. Purification of the enzymatic activity resulted in a xylanase of MW 41 000 - 42 000 Da.Efforts were made to isolate another strain of Bacillus s earo hermophilus which could be used for purification of other delignifying enzymatic activities than xylanase activity. It was envisaged that e.g. an α-L-arabinofuranosidase being capable of delignifying wood pulp at a high temperature and a high pH would be an additional useful tool in the development of a bleaching sequence without any chlorine-containing bleaching chemicals.Recently WO 91/18976 (filed by Novo Nordis A/S) was published. Claim 14 thereof is directed to an arabinofuranosidase enzyme produced by Bacillus
