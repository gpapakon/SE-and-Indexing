<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention refers to a front loading laundry washing, of the type described
in the preamble of the annexed claim 1.As is known, domestic laundry washing machines can be of the top loading or front
loading type, according to the arrangement of the opening for the loading and
unloading of the clothes from the machine; the existence of two such categories of
machines is due to various factors, from among which it is to be remembered the
availability of space within the house, the aesthetic needs and, last but not least, the
simple preference of the user for one type of laundry washing machine compared to
the other.Generally laundry washing machines are made up of a parallelepiped cabinet
containing a tub assembly; such tub assembly includes a container for the washing
liquid, or a tub in a strict sense of the word, within which a basket for the laundry is
mounted in a way so as to enable it to rotate around a substantially horizontal axis.In the case of the front loading machines the basket, of a cylindrical form, has an
opening in its frontal wall, substantially coaxial to two openings respectively present
on the frontal wall of the tub and of the cabinet of the machine; the laundry is thus
loaded and unloaded in relation to the basket through such openings that, during the
functioning of the machine, are closed by a door, generally of a circular shape.Inside the cabinet, appropriate means are provided for producing the rotation of the
basket (electric motor, belts and pulleys), means for the supply and the discharge of
the washing liquid from the tub (hydraulic conduits and one or more pumps) and a 
distributor device of washing agents, able to supply over determined times of the
functioning cycle of the laundry washing machine the detergent or eventual additives
inside the tub.In front loading washing machines of the known type, the detergent distributor, which
is usually arranged in the upper part of the cabinet of the machine, has the form of a
drawer with several distinct compartments, and has a conduit which connects the
drawer vane with the upper zone of the washing tub. The drawing of the detergent
from the distributor usually occurs by means of a water flow which conveys the
detergent in the tub in a time varying within 60" and 120"; most of the detergent is of
course drawn in the initial seconds and therefore the detergent concentration in water
is initially very high. This detergent, that has not been able to dissolve, mixed with
water, deposits in the lowermost parts of the tub,

<CLAIMS>
Front loading laundry washing machine, of the domestic type, comprising a
cabinet (1), a washing chamber (8) arranged within said cabinet (1), a basket (9) for

the laundry and a washing agents distribution device (14), the basket (9) being
mounted in the washing chamber (8) so as to rotate around a substantially horizontal

axis, the cabinet (1), the washing chamber (8) and the basket (9) each having an
aperture (11;12;13) in the respective frontal walls for allowing the loading and the

unloading of the laundry in the basket (9), the three apertures (11;12;13), during the
operation of the machine, being closed by a door (4-6), characterised in that the body

of the washing agents distributor (14) is mounted on the lower edge of the aperture
(12) being present in the frontal wall of the washing chamber (8) and in order to face

towards the inside of the basket (9) through the aperture (11) of the latter.
Front loading laundry washing machine, according to claim 1, characterised
in that the body of the distributor (14) has a portion protruding in the inside of the

basket (9).
Front loading laundry washing machine, according to claim 1, characterised
in that the body of the distributor (14) operates as an element which impedes the

exiting of the laundry from the basket (9) and/or the exiting of the washing liquid from
the tub (8) when the door (4) is opened.
Front loading laundry washing machine, according to claim 1 or 2,
characterised in that means are provided for producing the discharge of the washing

agents, contained in the body of the distributor (14), directly inside the basket (9).
Front loading laundry washing machine, according to claim 1, characterised
in that the washing chamber-basket assembly (8,9) is suspended within the cabinet (1)

so as that the aperture (13) in the frontal wall of the cabinet (1) extends to a great
extent, and in particular completely, in the upper half of the latter, in proximity of the

able to take on at least two positions:

a test position (figure 2), in which the surface (7) is in a vertical position and in
particular housed in an appropriate seat, so as that it does not overcome the frontal

dimensions of the cabinet (1). 
a work position (figure 3), in which the surface (7) is in a horizontal position so as
to function as a support, in particular for a container (20) of laundry to be loaded or

unloaded from the machine.

interior of the cabinet (1).
Laundry washing machine, according to the previous claim, characterised in
that the shapes of the body of the distributor (14) and of central part (6) of the door (4)
