<ABSTRACT>
A pen having a holder (10) and a mechanism (11) arranged in the pen, comprises a substantially hemispherical writing end and has such a mass distribution that its centre of gravity is located between the crest of the writing end and the meridian plane of the substantially hemispherical writing end, such that the pen, when put e.g. on a table and having its nib (12) retracted, will automatically rise so as to stand substantially on the crest of the writing end when in its resting position.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a pen of the type 
having a mechanism for extending and retracting a nib at 
the writing end. Such pens are commonly used for advertising 
purposes, but may also be placed in pen stands, e.g. 
on a reception desk. In the latter case, the pens have to 
be easily accessible as well easy to seize by the user. 
In a popular design, this is achieved by arranging a magnet 
in the penholder and then placing the pen in a separate 
stand in which a magnet is arranged in a projecting 
bracket, thereby using magnetic forces to make the pen 
stand up seemingly by itself. GB-A-2,164,004 teaches an 
instance of this technique. The present invention aims at simplifying such prior-art 
pens while maintaining the desired function, i.e. providing 
a pen which, in resting position, stands up so as 
to be easy to seize as well as expose advertising text, if 
any. A special aim is to provide such a pen which is in no 
need of any separate, specially-designed stand. The invention is based on the idea of designing the 
pen with a substantially hemispherical writing end and so 
locating the centre of gravity of the pen within the hemispherical 
writing end that the pen will occupy a stable 
resting position when erected. The characteristic features of the pen according to 
the invention are recited in appended claim 1. The appended 
subclaims define especially preferred embodiments. Thus, an inventive pen has a holder and a mechanism 
contained in the pen. The writing end of the pen is substantially 
hemispherical. At the writing end, there is 
provided a weight of such mass that the centre of gravity 
of the pen is located between the meridian plane of the 
substantially hemispherical writing end and the crest of 
the writing end, so that the pen, when put on e.g. a table 
and having its nib retracted, will automatically rise to 
an upright resting position.  
 The accompanying drawing illustrates an embodiment of 
the pen according to the invention. In the drawing, 
Fig. 1shows the pen when standing in its resting position, Fig. 2is a section taken along the line II-II in Fig. 1, Fig. 3shows the pen in use with the nib extended, and Fig. 4illustrates the rocking function of the pen when 
rising to the upright position (Fig. 1). The embodiment of the inventive pen shown in the 
drawing has a holder 10 in which is arranged a mechanism 
11. Although the illustrated mechanism is very simple, it 
will be appreciated that other and more complicated mechanisms 
may be used. The mechanism 11 adjusts

<CLAIMS>
A pen having a holder (10) and a mechanism (11) 
arranged in the pen and serving to retract and extend a 

nib (12) at the writing end (13) of the pen, 

characterised
 in that the writing end (13) of the 
pen is substantially hemispherical, is provided substantially 

at its crest with the extendible nib (12), and contains 
a weight (14) of such a mass that the centre of gravity 

of the pen is located between the crest of the writing 
end and the meridian plane of the substantially 

hemispherical writing end, so that the pen will in itself 
occupy a stable resting position when erected. 
A pen as set forth in claim 1, 

characterised
 in that the distance between the centre of 
gravity of the pen and the crest of the writing end (13) 

is shorter than the distance between the centre of gravity 
of the pen and the meridian plane of the substantially 

hemispherical writing end. 
A pen as set forth in claim 1, 

characterised
 in that the weight placed in the writing 
end (13) is in the form of a body (14) filling up only 

those parts of the substantially hemispherical writing 
end (13) that are closest to the crest of the writing end. 
A pen as set forth in claims 1 and 3, 

characterised
 in that said body (14) is substantially 
in the form of a spherical sector whose spherical end is 

located in the area of the crest of the writing end (13). 
A pen as set forth in claims 1 and 3, 

characterised
 in that said body (14) is substantially 
in the form of two coherent spherical calottes (14', 14") 

of different radius, the radius of the one calotte (14') 
being approximately of the same size as the radius of the 

hemispherical portion of the writing end (13) while the 
radius of the other calotte (14") is approximately half  

 
the size of the radius of the hemispherical portion of the 

writing end (13), and that the larger-radius end of the 
body (14) is located in the area of the crest of the 

writing end (13).
