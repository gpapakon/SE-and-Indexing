<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates in general to the exocellular production of
antibodies in single molecule form (scFv) from Bacillus subtilis
(B. subtilis).In particular, this invention relates to a recombinant vector
which comprises the promoter of the gene for neutral protease, a
new secretion sequence and a DNA sequence coding a scFv antibody
of interest, a strain of B.subtilis transformed with said
recombinant vector and a process for the exocellular production
of scFv antibodies by culturing of said strain of
B.subtilis.The possibility of obtaining antibody fragments (mini-antibodies)
by their expression in bacterial cells has opened up new
and interesting application prospects.In fact, their reduced dimensions allow an improvement in
pharmacokinetic characteristics for diagnostic and therapeutic
uses. In addition, the production of mini-antibodies in
microorganisms is economically more favourable than the production
of monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) in mammalian cells since greater
reproducibility of the preparations and a complete absence of 
possible contaminants from oncogenic viral DNA are guaranteed.The antibodies are tetrameric proteins formed from two heavy
chains (H) and two light chains (K or lambda). In the H chain a
variable region (VH) and three constant regions may be observed,
while in the light chain only one constant region is present in
addition to the variable region (VK). The variable parts, which
are at the amino-terminal end of each chain, are responsible for
binding to the antigen whereas the constant portions interact with
the other components of the immune system (effector function).The regions responsible for binding to the antigen and those with
an effector function may be separated by enzymatic digestion
without altering their functionality. Indeed, it is known that
the Fv portion of the antibody, ie VH + VK, isolated by means of
enzymatic digestion of IgG, maintains totally its ability to bind
to the antigen.The use of said portion of the antibody, which forms the entire
antigen-binding site, may present some stability problems for the
Fv in that the two chains, not being covalently bound, tend to
dissociate.Recently some strategies have been proposed to reduce the drawback
of the two chains dissociating.Of particular interest appears to be that described by Bird et
al., 1988 (Science, 242: 423-426) which consists of the expression
in E.coli of a molecule formed by the union of the variable
regions of the two chains by way of a suitable peptide (linker).The two regions VH and VK
