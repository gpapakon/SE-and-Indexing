<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to an electrical installation apparatus (10), having an apparatus base (14) with contacts (16, 18, 19) arranged thereon, and having control elements for operating the electrical installation apparatus, which apparatus base has physical dimensions which allow it to be used for standardised surface-mounted or flush-mounted installation, as well as having an additional module (28) which is arranged on the rear side of the apparatus base (14), facing away from the operating side, at least two contacts (16) having connecting pieces (30) being provided, which connecting pieces (30) interact with the additional module (28) and are used to hold it as well as for the electrical connection to it, the fitting of the board (28), which is provided as the additional module, being flat in terms of the physical dimensions of the components (32) which are to be arranged on it, specifically being provided parallel to the board (28), the cavities and intermediate spaces which exist in the standard base (14) not being used and resulting in only a small increase in the physical depth in comparison with the design without any additional module (28), so that the overall physical depth of the standard base (14) which is provided with the additional module (28) complies with the acceptable installation depth of 32 mm for standardised built-in boxes.

An electric installation device (10), comprising a base (14) with contacts (16, 18, 19)
arranged thereon and operating elements for actuating the electric installation device,

which base is provided with constructional dimensions which allows its use for
standardized surface or concealed mounting, as well as an additional module which is

arranged on the rear side of the base (14) which is averted from the actuation side, with at
least two contacts (16) being provided with connecting members (30) which cooperate with

the additional module (28) and are used for its electric connection, with the fitting of the
printed circuit board (28) which is provided as the additional module being provided in a flat

fashion, namely parallel to the circuit board (28), concerning the constructional dimensions
of the components (32) to be disposed thereon, 
characterized in that
 the at least two
contacts (16) with connecting members (30) are used for supporting the additional module

(28), that the hollow spaces or intermediate spaces as are present in the standard base
(14) are not used in order to house components of the additional module (28), that as

compared with the design without the additional module (28) there is an only small
increase of the overall depth, so that the overall depth of the standard base (14) provided

with the additional module (28) does not exceed the permissible installation depth of 32
mm with respect to standard mounting boxes, and that a conventional housing cover (20),

such as for devices without an additional module, is used such as central disk (22), cover
frame (24) and socket box (23).
An electric installation device as claimed in claim 1, 
characterized in that
 the connecting
pieces are shaped on the respective contacts (16, 18, 19) in an integral fashion.
An electric installation device as claimed in claim 1, 
characterized in that
 the connecting
pieces are welded together with the respective contacts (16, 18, 19).
An electric installation device as claimed in claim 1, 
characterized in that
 the connecting
pieces (30) are connected with the respective contacts (16, 18, 19) in a frictional

connection or in a frictional and positive-locking manner.
An electric installation device as claimed in one of the preceding claims, 
characterized in
that
 several connecting pieces (30) are provided which connect the additional module (28)
with the base (14), with the connecting pieces (30) being connected with the pole contacts

(16), protective earth contacts (18) and voltageless contacts which are used as connection
contacts.
An electric installation device as claimed in one of the preceding claims, 
characterized in
that
 the fastening of the connecting pieces (30) on the additional module (28) is provided
as a soldered connection.
An electric installation device as claimed in one of the preceding claims, 
characterized in
that
 an installation device for concealed mounting is concerned, that the overall depth of
the base (14) with the additional module (28) arranged thereon reaches not more than the

maximum permitted standard installation depth.
An electric installation device as claimed in claim 6 or 7, 
characterized in that
 the
constructional dimensions of the base (14) with the additional module (28) allow for its

mounting the use of accessories such as an installation device cover (20) or the like
according to conventional design. 
An electric installation device as claimed in one of the preceding claims, 
characterized in
that
 in the case of an arrangement as a concealed socket outlet with earthing contact, a
conventional central disk (22) can be used and that the distance of the upper side of the

socket-outlet box to the installation wall (21) corresponds to that of a conventional
concealed socket outlet with earthing contact.
