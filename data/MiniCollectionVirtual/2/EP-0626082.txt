<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a device for controlling, regulating and monitoring remote heating systems using exchange stations at the final users' premises. According to the invention, several exchange stations (25, 26, 27 or 28, 29, 30 or 31, 32, 33 or 34, 35, 36) are brought together to form groups of stations (37, 38, 39, 40) which are each connected to a central master computer (2) via a data concentrator (11, 12, 13, 14). Each station (25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36) has a remote heating meter and freely programmable electronic units. The central master computer (2) has a program for interrogation, diagnosis and value predetermination and for the graphic display of test and fault data and is coupled via a backbone LAN to an energy management computer (3) fitted with an energy optimising program. The device of the invention makes it possible for the remote heat generator to match the energy supply precisely to the current energy requirement on the basis of the information transmitted to the central master computer from the exchange stations via the data network and thus to make the best possible use of the available energy.
