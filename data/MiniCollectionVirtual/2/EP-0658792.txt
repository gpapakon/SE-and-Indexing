<ABSTRACT>
Optical processor intended to be subjected to a write radiation in order to treat a read radiation which it receives, comprising an electrooptic material (Q2), a first and a second material (Q1, Q3) distributed on either side of the electrooptic material (Q2), these first and second materials (Q1, Q3) being collecting quantum wells, materials (6, 8) forming quantum barriers being interposed between these two materials (Q1, Q3) and the electrooptic material (Q2), one (6) of these materials forming a quantum barrier constituting a filter. The charges of a certain sign, photoexcited by the write radiation in a material (4, Q1) on one side of this filter, pass through, in the absence of an external electric field, in order to relax in the collecting quantum well (Q3) located on the other side of this filter (6), the charges of opposite sign being blocked by this filter (6) in the other (Q1) collecting well.
