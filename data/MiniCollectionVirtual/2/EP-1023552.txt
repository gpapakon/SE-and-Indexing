<ABSTRACT>
A flexible pressure pipe (1), with an associated end-fitting (9) having an axially extending through opening (14), is of a non-bonded structure comprising a number of layers (2, 3, 4, 5, 7) including an extruded polymer inner lining (3) extending into the through opening (14). In the outer surface of the end part of the inner lining two annular grooves (23) are formed by rolling and two opposing grooves (28) are formed in the inner surface of the lock ring (27). By fitting two circlips (29) into both the grooves (23) in the inner lining (3) and in the lock ring (27), the latter is attached to the lining (3), whereafter the lock ring (27) is fitted into a holding groove (17) in the wall of the through opening (14) of the end-fitting (9). The joint between the inner lining (3) of the flexible pressure pipe (1) and the end-fitting (9) is a simple and cheap structure and provides a greater resistance to axial tensile loads acting on the inner lining (3) than has been know before.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention concerns a flexible pressure pipe with an
associated end-fitting having an axially extending through
opening, where the pipe is of a non-bonded structure comprising
a number of layers including an extruded polymer inner lining
extending into the through opening.Flexible pressure pipes are used for a variety of applications,
including water supply lines, sewage lines and lines for
transporting chemicals such as liquid ammonia and phosphoric
acid and also high pressure offshore flexible pipes for the oil
and gas industry.The joint between the inner lining and the end-fitting must be
able to resist the axial tensile load acting on the inner
lining, when the flexible pipe is descending over a great
length, and also such stresses which arise as a consequence of
temperature fluctuations.Conventionally, said joint is provided by squeezing the inner
lining between an outer conical ring and an inner conical ring
which is pressed in between the inner lining and the carcass of
the pipe. The effect of this squeezing will, however, diminish
gradually as the plasticizer disappears from the plastic
material of the lining.Another drawback is that temperature stresses can arise in the
joint because the plastic material has a high coefficient of
expansion.In the document GB 891 611 A is described a tamber-proof
fitting for attachment to the end of a hose having a liner of
substantially plastic material with a braided covering thereon.
By assembling, an end of the liner is squeezed between an inner
nipple and an outer body member having, on the innerside, sharp
ribs which by the squeezing is forced into the material of the
liner forming complementary sharp grooves in the liner. This known technique cannot be used for pipes having an inner
carcass which not allows the liner to be squeezed and the
nipple to be screwed in. Furthermore, the sharp grooves in the
liner functions with a dangerous notch effect which is not
acceptable for high-quality flexible pressure pipes exposed to
high loads.The object of the invention is to provide a flexible pressure
pipe with an associated end-fitting of the type mentioned in
the opening paragraph in which the joint between the inner
lining of the pipe and the end-fitting is a simple and cheap
structure and provides a greater resistance to axial tensile
loads acting on the inner lining than has been known before.This is achieved in that on the outer surface of the end part
of the inner lining at least one annular groove is formed, a
lock ring being subsequently
attached to
