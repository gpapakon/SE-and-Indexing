<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to an improved method for collecting yarn
in automatic winding machines according to the preamble of claim 1 and to an improved
device for implementing said winding method according to the preamble of claim 4.The invention relates particularly to yarn winding after its
controlled cutting, this winding being required to take place
within the central portion of the bobbin.It is known in the art that winding machines in general, and
bobbin winding machines in particular, are provided with bobbin
carrying arms. These arms consist essentially of a mandrel formed
from a fixed fixing centre and a movable fixing centre, the
purpose of which is to carry, centre and fix the tube onto which
the yarn is wound to form the bobbin, and to allow regular yarn
winding.The bobbin assumes either substantially cylindrical or
substantially frusto-conical shapes. Frusto-conical shapes are
often formed in order to facilitate yarn unwinding during the
subsequent fabric manufacture stages.At each request for controlled yarn cutting it can happen that the 
yarn end is winding onto one of the two ends of the bobbin under
formation and, suite frequently, that the yarn - having its cut
end suddenly without tension and uncontrolled - deposits in the
form of several turns about one of the fixing centres of the yarn
carrying mandrel. Alternatively, that yarn portion which escapes
from the side of a frusto-conical bobbin deposits about the
circumferential gripping line between the fixing centre and the
end of the tube.During the next joining or knotting cycle it can happen that not
all the yarn turns wound on the fixing centre are gripped, unwound
and removed by the suction port; on restarting the winding process
the bobbin under formation again accumulates wound yarn, but there
remains the presence of a more or less lengthy yarn portion
extending beyond the side of the bobbin.Even worse happens if the suction port is unable to suck-in the
yarn end because it is too distant. The unit is then compelled to
stop, to interrupt the winding process and to require the
assistance of a service operator. The cost of this assistance and
the reduction in the machine service factor considerably influence
the production cost calculation. The efficiency of service
operators is very low due to the randomness of the operations as
opposed to programmed intervention.A further serious drawback arises from the yarn portions extending
outside the bobbin, which can compromise correct use of the bobbin
during its unwinding in subsequent

An improved method for collecting yarn in an
automatic winding machine, such as automatic bobbin winding

machines, preferably consisting of a plurality of side by
side winding units in which the yarn is wound as cross-yarn

bobbins by the simultaneous action of a drive roller (3) and
a yarn guide element which induces a traversing movement in

the yarn (5), such method being directed to collect the end

of the cut yarn on the central portion of the bobbin under
formation when the yarn is caused to be cut by cutting

members of the winding units, and including the steps of:

determining the position of the winding yarn on the
bobbin (15) under formation, which moment by moment changes

its angular position (24) in the frontal plane of the winding
machine within a sector (28-29) with continuous to-and-fro

reciprocating traversing movement;
feeding into the machine control unit (1) the
characterising values for the bobbin under formation,

consisting of values representing the yarn being wound, the
desired bobbin quality;
preparing in said machine control unit (1) the required
yarn cutting request signals, following the presence of an

undesirable defect, on the basis of said characterising value
for the bobbin under formation, characterised by further

comprising the steps of:
continuously and simultaneously measuring both the yarn
winding speed and its transverse speed during its traversing

movement;
continuously and simultaneously detecting the angular
position (24) of the yarn (5) and its direction of movement;
transmitting the information from the sensors for said
measurements and detection to the computing centre of the

machine control unit (1) to exactly calculate, on the basis
of the values of the speed measurements, of the detected 

angular position and direction of movement of the yarn, and
of the length left free on controlled cutting of the yarn,

the time for cutting the yarn such that the yarn end left
free after cutting winds on a central portion of the bobbin

within a frontal angular sector (20).
An improved method for collecting yarn in an automatic
winding machine, such as automatic bobbin winding machines, as 

claimed in claim 1, characterised in that the characterising
values for the type of yarn being wound are values indicative of

the elastic behaviour of the yarn and its count, said values being
predetermined and being fed into the control unit via a control

keyboard.
An improved method for collecting yarn in an automatic
winding machine, such as automatic bobbin winding machines, as

claimed in claim 1, characterised in that the characterising
values for the bobbin quality consist of geometrical bobbin values

and values representing the allowable yarn count variation range,
the control unit eliminating those yarn portions which locally

fall outside a determined count range or present substantial count
variations contained within said range but of a significant length

or with an unacceptable frequency, based on the analysis of
defects indicated by a yarn feeler means which provides the

machine control unit with electrical pulses unequivocally
corresponding to the detection of defects. 
An improved device for implementing the winding method
claimed in claim 1, preferably consisting of a plurality of side

by side winding units, comprising:

means for determining the position of the winding yarn on
the bobbin (15) under formation, which moment by moment changes

its angular position (24) in the frontal plane of the winding
machine within a sector (28-29) with continuous to-and-fro

reciprocating traversing movement;
means for feeding into the machine control unit (1) the
characterising values for the bobbin under formation, consisting

yarn winding speed and its traversing speed during its traversing

movement ;
means for continuously and simultaneously detecting the
angular position (24) of the yarn (5) and its direction of

movement ; said means being associated with the control unit (1)
which processes the determined working parameters for the process

underway and the signals received from said measuring and
detecting means to exactly calculate the time for cutting the

yarn, and when a yarn cutting signal arises provides a control
signal to the cutting means so that they act at that precise

moment which enables the cut yarn end to wind onto a central
portion of the bobbin under formation.
An improved winding machine as claimed in claim 4,
characterised in that the means for instantaneously measuring the

winding parameters comprise a probe disc (2) for measuring both the
rotational speed and the angular position of the drive roller (3), and

a proximity sensor (6) which provides moment by moment a signal
identifying the angular position of the winding yarn during its

traversing reciprocating movement.
An improved winding machine as claimed in claim 4,

the effective yarn winding speed, as a transducer for the yarn
length effectively wound per unit of time, and as an element for

measuring the angular position of the drive roller (3).
An improved winding machine as claimed in claim 4,
characterised in that the proximity sensor (6) is used as a transducer

for the axial position, moment by moment, of the yarn winding
point on the bobbin.

and corresponding to the reversal points (38a, 38b) of the traversing

movement, so that the sensor (6) is at its minimum distance from one
of the limit stops (32, 34) when the yarn reaches one of its movement

reversal points (5a, 5b).
An improved winding machine as claimed in claim 4,
characterised in that the control unit (1) of each individual winding

unit is a minicomputer or microprocessor connected to the machine
central control unit into which the data relative to the process

underway are fed via a control keyboard (8), said minicomputer
processing the signals generated by a probe disc (2) which measures

both revolutions and revolution fractions of the bobbin drive
roller, the signals generated by a proximity sensor (6) which

identifies the angular position of the yarn during its traversing
reciprocating movement, and the signals from the monitoring of the

yarn within the yarn clearer (16) for detecting its defects, in order
to provide the yarn cutting command at the required moment for the

cut yarn end to be wound onto a central surface portion 20 of the
bobbin under formation.
