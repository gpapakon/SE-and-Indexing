<ABSTRACT>
A system and method for the classification of defects on 
electronic chips and the like. The effect image is 

extracted by image comparison techniques, visual features 
are computed and the best classification of the defect 

image is determined in a fuzzy logic based expert system. 
The system for carrying out such method comprises means for 

forming a "golden image" and a defect image, for obtaining 
a difference image of these and feature extraction, and 

means for the evaluation of the defects based on these.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a system and method for automatic 
defect classification on silicon wafers and similar 
products. It is especially suited for the automatic 
inspection and defect classification during the production 
of silicon wafer microelectronic chips (printed circuits), 
with a wide variety of chip patterns and also with a 
plurality of layers. The novel system operates in an 
essentially automatic manner, it has a high degree of 
accuracy and is able to effect inspections at a high speed. 
Due to the simplicity of operation of the system, it can be 
operated with ease and technicians can easily be taught how 
to correctly operate the system. Fab engineers can define defect categories without 
knowledge of Image processing using Defect Description 
Lanugage. The system of the invention is preferably interfaced with a 
commercially available review station. Inspection of wafers in order to determine the occurance of 
defects, and to classify these is of utmost importance in 
the production process of these. Semiconductor wafers are produced by complicated multi-step 
processes. Technologies in the submicron range are very 
delicate, and there is always a chance of error or 
malfunction at each of the many stages. These costly 
errors should be ascertained as soon as possible. On-line 
inspection and quality control measures are imperative 
stages of the production process.  There exists a real need for high speed, high volume, 
product capable of efficient automatic inspection and 
classification. There have been used various inspection techniques, but due 
to the rather large number of defects and the monotonous 
nature of this work, visual inspection causes fatigue and 
eye-strain and there are apt to occur mistakes after a 
certain period of time. There were introduced automatic inspection systems which 
analyze the inspected wafer and determine defect location 
in an automatic manner. The task of the operator with 
such systems is to classify the defects, to determine their 
severity, whether a wafer can be used or must be discarded, 
and if possible - to ascertain the source of the defects in 
the production line. In practice there were encountered up to about 4,000 
defects in a single 8" wafer and this makes the inspection 
and classification very monotonuous and time consuming. Hitherto there have not been commercialized any automatic 
defect classification systems, which carry out 
automatically all the steps of the classification, 
including location of defects, classification of
