<ABSTRACT>
A water-dispersible product, such as a tablet or briquette, comprises at least one active material and a binder wherein the binder includes one or more polyphosphate chains, borate ions or silicate ions. The polyphosphate chains, borate ions and silicate ions are respectively derived from a water-soluble phosphate glass, a water-soluble borate glass and a water-soluble silicate glass. The active material may be a pharmacologically-active substance, a pesticide or a herbicide.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to products which are dispersed 
by an aqueous medium. More particularly it relates to 
products which have a component that dissolves in an aqueous 
medium, the remaining product being dispersed by the aqueous 
medium. Furthermore it relates to a product in which the 
dissolving of the component and the dispersal of the 
remaining product is effected in a controlled manner in an 
aqueous medium. In some industries an active material is released into 
an environment in order to effect a controlled reaction in 
the environment. The active material is commonly stored as a 
solid or as solution, and usually has to be part of an 
aqueous medium to be released. In the agricultural industry crops of cultivated plants 
are protected by the use of pesticides and/or insecticides. 
Hereinafter the term "pesticide" includes insecticides and 
other such materials. Pesticides are usually stored in 
liquid form and sprayed directly onto the crop to destroy 
insects and/or other organisms which are harmful to the 
crop. The pesticide may be sold as a concentrated liquid 
which needs to be diluted prior to spraying of the crop.  
 Some pesticides seriously contaminate the material of 
the container in which they are held and this can lead to 
problems in the disposal of these containers. In some cases, 
the contamination is so bad that the containers are returned 
to the pesticide manufacturer who will arrange for proper 
disposal of the contaminated containers. This is 
significantly costly to the manufacturer and consequently 
there is a need to reduce or substantially eliminate the cost of 
contamination of the packaging of pesticides. In the pharmaceutical industry many drugs are 
administered by mixing a solid (i.e. a tablet) which contains 
an active material with an aqueous medium (i.e. water) which 
is then swallowed by the patient. Some tablets dissolve or 
break up to form a suspension in the water, and others are 
swallowed whole with the water being `used as an aid to 
swallowing the tablet. It will be appreciated that it is necessary to carefully 
control the dissolution rate or break-up rate of tablets 
which contain drugs depending on which drug is to be 
administered. Some tablets take a considerable time to 
fully dissolve or break up which is inconvenient and extends 
the discomfort felt by the patient. Consequently there is a 
need to control the dissolution rate or break-up rate of some 
pharmaceutical tablets. According to the present invention there is provided a  
 
product
