<ABSTRACT>
In a hollow section (1), especially for making ventilation control flaps in air-handling plants and devices, in which the hollow section (1) consists of two metal half-sections (2) secured together along the long edges, a system is to be provided by means of which, while retaining the advantages of prior art hollow aluminium sections, the advantages of a more economical production system are to be gained with a sheet-metal hollow section of the description. This is achieved in that the hollow section (1) consists of two identical, mirror-image-symmetrically joined half-sections (2a, 2b) forming an acceptance region (6) for a pivot, whereby each half-section (2) has in the central region two folded section shanks (3) facing inwards in the position of use which, in the closed position, side-by-side form the acceptance region (6) for the pivot.
