<ABSTRACT>
An apparatus and method for detecting the seam (98) in a photoreceptor belt (17) is 
provided. A sensor is positioned on one side of the belt in opposed relationship to a light 

source (12A) which can be a lamp dedicated solely to that purpose or light from an imager such 
as an LED array or a Raster Output Scanner. Illumination from the light source (12A) or the end 

of the array is detected by a sensor (40) when the seam (98) passes therebetween creating a 
characteristic output signal which is recognized by system software and used to control imager 

operation to ensure that latent images are not formed across the seam (98).

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates generally to an electrophotographic printing machine having a
seamed, web-type photoreceptor suitable for the exposure of one or more document latent
images on the surface thereof, and, more particularly, to a method and apparatus for detecting
the belt seam and for generating a signal useful for process control and machine timing.The features of the present invention may be used in the printing arts, and, more
particularly, in electrophotographic printing. In the process of electrophotographic printing, a
photoconductive surface is charged to a substantially uniform potential. The photoconductive
surface is then image-wise exposed to record an electrostatic latent image corresponding to
the informational areas of an original document being reproduced. Thereafter, a developer
material is transported into contact with the electrostatic latent image. Toner particles are
attracted from the carrier granules of the developer material onto the latent image. The
resultant toner powder image is then transferred from the photoconductive surface to a copy
sheet and permanently affixed thereto. The foregoing description generally describes a typical
single color electrophotographic copying machine.For many high speed copier applications a photoreceptor belt is preferred for the
photosensitive member. Belts have the capacity to form a plurality of images in a plurality of
image frames available on the photoreceptor surface during a single pass or revolution of the
belt. As is known in the art, belts are formed by a process which leaves a seam extending across
the belt width. The seam presents a discontinuity in the photoreceptor surface. In operation,
the photoreceptor belt is moved at a predefined velocity, and the rate of travel of the
advancing copy sheet is controlled so as to regulate the exposure and transfer operations in
accordance with the position of the advancing sheet. Minor variations in the speed of the belt
drive motor, due, for example, to variations in the power line voltage, result in a variation of
the position of latent images on the photoreceptor. These variations are cumulative in nature
and must be corrected to assure that the latent images are exposed at generally the same
positions on the photoreceptor each time. If not corrected, the cumulative variation would
eventually cause one or more of the exposed latent image areas to encroach on the
photoreceptor seam, subsequently resulting in an unacceptable copy.A number of techniques have been developed to overcome this
</DESCRIPTION>
<CLAIMS>
An imaging system for forming multiple image exposure frames on a light
transmissive photoreceptor belt (17) having a seam (98) extending across the width thereof, said

system including:

a photoreceptor belt (17) adapted to accommodate the formation of an integral number of
image exposure frames (I
1
-I
4
), said belt (17) having at least one registration mark (30) associated
with at least one image frame (I
1
), said mark (30) located outside of the exposure frame (I
1
),
at least one imager (12A) associated with the formation of one of said image exposure
frames (I
1
-I
4
), each imager (12A) having a first portion of light emitting pixels which are selectively
activated to form said image exposure frames and a second portion of light emitting pixels outside of

said exposure area which are activated for imager registration and seam detection purposes,
detecting means (40) associated with said second portion and on the opposite side of the
belt, said detecting means (40) generating a first set of output signals when said registration marks

(30) pass between said second portion and the detecting means (40) and a second set of output
signals when said belt seam passes between the second portion and the detecting means (40), and
control means (15) for comparing said output signals and generating at least a seam
identification signal upon detecting a second output signal associated with passage of the belt seam

(98).
An imaging system as claimed in claim 1, wherein said first portion of the imager
(12A) is a central portion of light emitting pixels and said second portion of the imager (12A) is an

end portion of light emitting pixels.
An imaging system as claimed in claim 1 or claim 2, wherein the imager is a LED
print bar.
