<ABSTRACT>
Multi-purpose exercise apparatus for exercising the muscles and training, having a vertical post (1) and an upper framework (3, 4) extending rearwards from the latter, a horizontal shaft (6) rotatably mounted therein, whose front end part is designed as a plug-in shaft (61) accessible from the front of the post, a cam wheel (7) arranged on the shaft (6) in a manner proof against rotation, a carriage (9) which is spring-loaded or weight-loaded and guided to be vertically displaceable along the post (1), and is connected to the circumference of the cam wheel (7) by a tensioning member (8), at least one training lever (20, 30) which can be optionally connected by plug-in fitting, in a manner proof against rotation, to the coupling shaft (61) of the shaft (6), and at least one plug-type coupling element (14) arranged at the front of the post (1) close to the shaft (9) for the optional plug-fitting of a part of the apparatus (40, 50) provided with a corresponding counter-fitting element.

Multi-purpose exercise machine for muscle and strength 
exercising, containing: 


a) a stand with a vertical support (1), a foot (2) and 
an upper frame (3, 4) arranged on the support and 

extending to the back of this, 
b) a shaft (6) mounted to rotate in the frame and 
running horizontally in a forwards-backwards 

direction, which is arranged substantially 
centrally in relation to the support (1), and the 

front end section of which is designed as an 
attachment shaft (61) accessible from the front of 

the support, 
c) an eccentric wheel (7) arranged non-rotatably on 
the shaft (6), the diameter of which intersecting 

the shaft runs approximately horizontal in the rest 
position of the machine, 
d) a slide (9) guided to move vertically along the 
support (1) and loaded with springs or weights, 
e) a tension element (8) connecting the slide with the 
periphery of the eccentric wheel (7), where the 

tension element is connected with the periphery of 
the eccentric wheel (7) in the area of an 

intersection with the horizontal diameter, or a 
point lying slightly below this, 
f) at least one exercise lever (20, 30) which can be 
connected non-rotatably to the coupling shaft (61) 

of the shaft (6), and 
g) at least one attachment coupling element (14) 
arranged close to the shaft (9) on the front of the  

 
support (1) for optional attachment of a machine 

part (40, 50) fitted with a corresponding counter-element. 
Exercise machine according to Claim 1, characterised in 
that handles (5) are arranged on the upper frame (3) on 

both sides of support (1). 
Exercise machine according to Claim 1 or 2, 
characterised in that the support (1) is designed as a 

rod-like column, and the upper frame as a horizontal 
frame (4) with a front cross piece (41) connected with 

the column (1), a rear cross piece (42) running parallel 
with this at a distance which can be attached to the 

wall, and connecting bars (43) running in between, where 
the shaft (6) runs between the front cross piece (41) 

and the rear cross piece (42). 
Exercise machine according to Claims 2 and 3, 
characterised in that the upper frame also has an upper 

cross piece (3) arranged above the horizontal frame (4) 
on the support (1), at both ends of which are arranged 

the handles (5). 
Exercise machine according to any of Claims 1 to 4, 
characterised in that the upper frame or at least the 

upper cross piece (3) is fitted with holes (15) for 
optional insertion of a stop pin (16) which lies to the 

front in the swivel path of an exercise lever (20, 30) 
attached to the coupling shaft (61). 
Exercise machine according to Claim 3, characterised in 
that the slide (9) essentially consists of a tubular 

body which surrounds the rod-like column (1) and can be 
slidably displaced on this, and attached to this a cross 

bar (91) extends symmetrically to both sides of the 
column, which serves for suspension of the upper spring 

ends of helical tension springs (11) suspended at their  
 

lower end on the foot (2), or for the attachment of 
weight discs (12). 
Exercise machine according to Claim 3, characterised in 
that below the eccentric wheel (7) but above the 

displacement path of the slide (9) is arranged a pair of 
guide rollers (10) on the column (1), between which the 

tension element is guided. 
Exercise machine according to any of Claims 1 to 7, 
characterised in that the tension element (8) is a 

chain. 
Exercise machine according to any of Claims 1 to 8, 
characterised in that the attachment shaft (61) of the 

shaft 6 is formed as a hexagonal bar and each attachable 
exercise lever has a corresponding hexagonal hole. 
Exercise machine according to any of Claims 1 to 9, 
characterised in that the exercise lever (20, 30) 

consists of a bar (22, 32), one end of which is fitted 
with a counter element for attachment to the attachment 

shaft (61), a sleeve (24, 34) guided to be 
longitudinally moveable on the bar, a locking element 

(25, 35) for locking the sleeve at a selected position 
along the bar, and a handle body (21, 31) arranged on 

the sleeve. 
Exercise machine according to Claim 11, characterised in 
that the handle body (21) is connected via a short crank
