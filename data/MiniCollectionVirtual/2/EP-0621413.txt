<ABSTRACT>
Rotationally resilient coupling for a machine part rotating about an axis (1), comprising an inner ring (2) with a groove (3) which is open axially in one direction and is bounded by two flank surfaces (4, 5) and a bottom surface (6), an outer ring (7) with an annular web (8) which extends parallel to the axis (1) and is accommodated in the groove (3), supported on one flank surface (4) by the guide ring (9) and connected to the other flank surface (5) by a damping ring (10) made of elastomeric material, the guide ring (9) and the damping ring (10) being designed to merge integrally into one another and being composed of elastomeric material.

<CLAIMS>
A torsionally elastic coupling for a machine 
component rotating about an axis (1), comprising an inner 

ring (2) with a groove (3) which is open axially in one 
direction and is bounded by
 two axially extending flank 
surfaces (4, 5) and a radially extending bottom surface 

(6), further comprising an outer ring (7) with an annular 
web (8) which extends parallel to the axis (1) and, 

having been accommodated in the groove (3), is supported 
on one flank surface (4) by a guide ring (9) designed as 

a sliding-contact bearing and is connected to the other 
flank surface (5) by a damping ring (10) made of 

elastomeric material, characterized in that the guide 
ring (9) and the damping ring (10) are designed to merge 

integrally into one another and are composed of a 
matching elastomeric material. 
A coupling according to claim 1, characterized in 
that the guide ring (9) and the damping ring (10) are 

connected by at least one extension (11), which passes 
through the web (8) - accommodated in the groove (3) - of 

the outer ring (7). 
Coupling according to either of claims 1 and 2, 
characterized in that the guide ring (9) and the damping 

ring (10) are connected by a supporting ring (13) which 
reaches around the web (8) - accommodated in the groove 

(3) - of the outer ring (7) in the region of its end (12) 
and in that the supporting ring (13) touches the bottom 

surface (6) of the groove (3), resting against it. 
A coupling according to any of claims 1 to 3, 
characterized in that the guide ring (9) has, on the side  

 
facing the flank surface (4) of the groove (3), lubricant 

pockets (14) which are distributed uniformly in the 
circumferential direction and are filled with a 

lubricant.
