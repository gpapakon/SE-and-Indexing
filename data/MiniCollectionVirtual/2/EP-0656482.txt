<ABSTRACT>
A blind rivet (2) comprises a rivet body (8) with an axial 
through bore (12), a head (16) at one end and inwardly extending lugs 

(24,26) at the tail end (14) which are provided with recess (32,34). 
The rivet (2) 

may be set by a tool (6) having lugs (46) adapted to engage in the 
recesses (32,34), and may be used as a drainage passage or as part 

of a releasable fastener.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention is concerned with blind rivets.Blind rivets, that is to say rivets which can be set
into a workpiece with access only to one side of the
workpiece, have been suggested in many different
configurations and for many different purposes. They can
conveniently be divided into two classes, those which have
an expendable mandrel assembled with a rivet body and those
which are set with a mandrel which is part of a tool.It is sometimes required, for example in the
manufacture of automobiles, to secure a small tube to a
workpiece for example to provide a drain hole. Such a small
tube may conveniently be provided by a blind rivet but,
because it is required to have a passage right through the
rivet, blind rivets of the first class, that is to say those
with an expendable mandrel, are not satisfactory as a head
portion of the mandrel is often left in the rivet after
setting, thus obstructing the passage through the rivet.It is therefore desirable to provide a blind rivet
which is set with a mandrel which is part of a tool which
may conveniently be set in a workpiece to provide a small
tube.A rivet is described in GB-A-584286 which is adapted to
be set by a mandrel of a setting tool comprising a rivet
body having a tubular wall surrounding an axial bore which
extends from a tail end portion to a head end portion of the
rivet, a head flange at the head end portion of the rivet
extending outwardly from the rivet body, abutment means at
the tail end portion of the rivet and comprising
diametrically opposed lugs extending generally radially
inwards of the wall of the rivet body. When it is desired
to set such a rivet, a mandrel having a cylindrical stem and
outwardly extending setting lugs complementary in shape to
the lugs of the rivet is passed through the axial bore of 
the rivet from the head flange outwardly of the tail end
portion, the lugs of the mandrel passing between the lugs of
the rivet. The mandrel is then rotated through a small
angle to bring the lugs of the mandrel into line with the
lugs of the rivet, and relative axial movement is then
caused between the rivet and the mandrel to cause the rivet
to be set, and the mandrel is then again rotated so that its
lugs are in line with the gaps between the lugs of the rivet
and the mandrel is withdrawn.This procedure suffers from a serious disadvantage. By
the nature of blind riveting the tail end portion of a rivet
being set, and the lugs on the mandrel being used to set it,
are not visible. For a reliable setting of the rivet it is
an essential

<CLAIMS>
A blind rivet adapted to be set by a mandrel of a
setting tool, comprising


a rivet body (8) having a tubular wall surrounding an axial
through bore which extends from a tail end portion to a head

end portion (16) of the rivet
a head flange (18) at the head end portion of the rivet
extending outwardly from the body,
abutment means at the tail end portion of the rivet
comprising two diametrically opposed lugs (24,26) extending

generally radially inwards of the wall of the rivet body characterised in the
lugs comprising diametrically aligned recesses (32,34) located in the axially outer surface of the lugs to face

outwardly towards the tail end of the rivet body.
A blind rivet according to Claim 1 wherein a portion of
the wall adjacent the head end portion of the rivet is

thinner than the remainder of the wall of the rivet body.
A blind rivet according to one of Claims 1 and 2 which
is made of aluminium alloy.
A method of setting a blind rivet according to any one
of the preceding claims comprising the use of a setting tool

comprising

a nosepiece (40)
a mandrel (4) extending through the nosepiece and
comprising a cylindrical stem and two diametrically opposed

outwardly extending setting lugs
a supporting member (42) mounted on the mandrel forwardly of
the nose piece
a spring (44) urging the supporting member and the nosepiece
apart
 
   and actuating means (36) for causing relative movement of

the nosepiece and the mandrel

   and comprising the steps of

(a) placing the rivet on the mandrel with the head of
the rivet engaging the supporting member with the mandrel

extending through the rivet with the setting lugs of the
mandrel located in the recesses of the lugs of the rivet
(b) positioning the rivet on the mandrel in a hole in a
workpiece
(c) causing relative movement of the mandrel and the
nosepiece to set the rivet and
(d) rotating the mandrel to disengage the lugs of the
mandrel from the lugs of the rivet and withdrawing the

mandrel from the set rivet.
