<ABSTRACT>
A fluid cutting system of improved configuration provides a high-velocity 
fluid that is 

rotated about a first axis (preferably a horizontal axis) on a moving 
trolley (21). The trolley is 

rotationally supported about a second axis (preferably vertical). The trolley travels upon a 
pair of arc-shaped tracks (19,20,29,30) and is driven by a motor drive. 

The trolley has a pair of arc-shaped 
tracks that support the fluid jet nozzle (38). The fluid nozzle is thus 

rotatable about two axes, 
thereby emitting a high-pressure stream of fluid for adjustable cutting. A workpiece 

positioning frame (12) has a fish section holder (46) that can be 
elevated or moved laterally with 

respect to the cutting system.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an improved fluid jetting knife robot apparatus having 
a fluid jet knife pivotally movable upon a trolley that is rotatable upon a fluid jet support 
flame. The fluid jet targets a movable frame holding a workpiece so that the fish processing 
uses the cutting action of the jet knife in combination with lateral and elevational movement 
of the workpiece in a plane that faces the fluid jet knife.  
 In the processing of food items, (such as fish or meat), undesirable bone, viscera, 
bloodmeat and the like must often be separated from edible parts. In the processing of fish 
such as tuna, it is common to freeze a catch of fish at sea, and to process the catch on shore. 
The processing normally involves thawing the fish followed by manual operations of slicing 
the fish belly and the removal of viscera. The visceral cavity is then washed with water, and 
the tuna inspected for spoilage. The tuna is then usually cooked whole in a batch type 
precooking operation. Manual prior art methods of processing tuna are described in greater detail in U.S. 
Patent 3,594,191 issued to J.M. Lapeyre. The '191 Lapeyre patent discloses the concept of 
cutting the tuna in lateral sections at spaced intervals and thereafter separating the edible loin 
portions to provide discrete cannable portions. A later U.S. patent 3,593,370 entitled "Method of Butchering Tuna" issued to J.M. 
Lapeyre, describes a method for processing such transverse tuna sections while frozen. The 
method of butchering frozen tuna described in the '370 Lapeyre patent includes the 
subdivision of the whole fish into a plurality of transverse cross-sections 
and subsequently 
subdividing the cross-sections into frozen segments. The junctures between the segments are 
along lines generally parallel to the longitudinal axis of the fish and to the backbone thereof. 
Each lateral fish section is skinned and the skinned sections operated on to effect a 
separation of the scrap parts of the segments from the loin meat parts, while the latter were 
still in at least a partially frozen condition.  
 U.S. Patent 3,800,363 issued to J.M. Lapeyre entitled "Tuna Butchering Method and 
System" describes an automated butchering method and system for separating the edible loin 
portions of transverse tuna slices provided by subdivision of a frozen whole tuna. Three additional, more recently issued U.S. Patents that are owned by The Laitram 
Corporation, assignee of the present application, and relate to transverse fish section 
processin

<CLAIMS>
A fish cutting apparatus for processing transversely cut fish sections having 
generally flat opposing surfaces connected with a peripheral curved surface comprising: 


a) a fluid jet frame with a fluid jetting knife movably supported with respect 
to the frame, and the knife having a nozzle that can emit a high velocity jet of fluid for 

cutting the fish sections to be processed, the nozzle having a fluid discharge orifice; 
b) means for rotating the fluid jetting nozzle about a selected pivot that 
rotates the knife about a pair of intersecting axes; 
c) a workpiece support frame spaced from the fluid jet frame so that the fluid 
jet knife is positioned to cut a workpiece supported upon the workpiece frame; and 
d) means for translating a workpiece with respect to the fluid jet flame during 
simultaneous jetting of the workpiece by the jet of fluid. 
The apparatus of Claim 1 wherein the fluid jet support frame includes a fixed 
portion and a moving sub-frame portion. 
The apparatus of Claim 1 wherein the support frame includes a fixed portion and 
a moving sub-frame portion that can be rotated with respect to the fixed portion. 
The apparatus of Claim 2 wherein the support frame includes a first fixed portion 
having multiple arcuate tracks, and a second portion that is movable upon the arcuate tracks. 
The apparatus of Claim 1 further comprising holder means for supporting the 
workpiece during cutting and which engages the workpiece at a position in between the flat 

opposing surfaces.  
 
The apparatus of Claim 1 wherein the knife can be rotated about a generally 

vertical axis, and about a generally horizontal axis. 
The apparatus of Claim 1 wherein the knife can be rotated simultaneously about 
generally horizontal and generally vertical axes. 
The apparatus of Claim 1 further comprising means for simultaneously moving a 
workpiece into multiple elevational and multiple laterally spaced apart positions with respect 

to the knife. 
The apparatus of Claim 1 wherein the workpiece can be moved laterally and 
elevationally with respect to the fluid jet frame.
