<ABSTRACT>
There is provided an apparatus for fast 
fermentation treatment in which temperature of organic 

industrial waste is rapidly increased to effect fast 
fermentation to allow a low running cost to be achieved. 

Hot water is circulated inside a rotary shaft (3) of a main 
body (1), while a sheath heater (21) is provided on an 

exterior surface of the main body (1). Organic industrial 
waste and ferment bacilli are put from an inlet into the 

main body (1) to increase temperature of the organic 
industrial waste up to 60°C within one hour by means of the 

hot water inside the rotary shaft (3) and the sheath heater 
(21). Subsequently, the sheath heater (21) may be operated 

intermittently or stopped because natural fermentation heat 
is generated from the organic industrial waste.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an apparatus for 
fast fermentation treatment which quickly ferments organic 
industrial waste or the like in an optimum condition. There are daily produced unimaginably huge amount 
of organic industrial wastes from the food processing 
industry, bean curd manufacturing industry, pharmaceutical 
industry, stock-raising industry, and fishing industry. 
These organic industrial wastes are currently dumped on a 
reclaimed land or incinerated. However, the dumping and incineration of the 
wastes disadvantageously require much energy resulting in 
cost increase, and may cause a secondary environmental 
pollution. In view of the above-mentioned problem, it has 
been tried to treat the organic industrial wastes with a 
fermentation accelerating agent (ferment bacillus). 
However, due to its slow fermentation, the above-mentioned 
method has been unable to be put into practice.  The object of the present invention is therefore 
to provide an apparatus for fast fermentation treatment 
capable of producing fermented manure and fermented feed by 
rapidly fermenting organic industrial waste and the like. In order to achieve the aforementioned object, 
the apparatus for fast fermentation treatment according to 
the first aspect of the present invention is characterized 
by comprising a main body which has an inlet and an outlet 
and receives therein organic material to be treated; a 
rotary shaft through which hot water circulates and which 
is rotatably provided in the main body with a paddle for 
stirring the organic material to be treated; a drive unit 
for driving the rotary shaft, an electric heater provided 
on an exterior surface of the main body; a temperature 
sensor for detecting temperature of the main body; a 
control section for controlling the electric heater so that 
the main body comes to have a specified temperature based 
on a signal representing the temperature of the main body 
from the temperature sensor; and a blower for discharging 
gas from the main body to supply air through an opening 
into the main body. The apparatus for fast fermentation treatment 
according to the second aspect of the present invention is 
characterized in that a hot water jacket is provided on the  
 
exterior surface of the main body so that the jacket covers 
the electric heater. The apparatus for fast fermentation treatment 
according to the third aspect of the present invention is 
characterized in that the main body is formed by connecting 
two containers each of which has an
