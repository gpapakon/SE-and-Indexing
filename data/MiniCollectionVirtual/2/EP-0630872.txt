<ABSTRACT>
A process for the production of ceramic materials 
having high compressive strength is disclosed which 

comprises admixing 100 weight parts of fly ash in about 15 
to 40 weight parts of NaOH water solution of about 5 to 60 N 

concentration, molding the admixture under pressure, and 
immediately, sintering at a temperature without drying and 

curing. The process is capable of making use of fly ash, 
pollutant, in enormous amounts, and ceramic materials 

produced thereby are utilized as useful materials such as 
construction materials, so that it is contributed to the 

reuse of industrial waste materials.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to ceramic materials having 
high compressive strength in which fly ash is in amount that 
may constitute a major proportion of the ceramic materials, 
and to a process for the production of the same. The present 
invention also relates to a process for the disposal of 
particulate waste materials which are resulted from the 
combustion of coal, such as fly ash, whereby these materials 
are converted into ceramic materials. In the devices utilizing coal as a power source, such as 
black coal-fired burners, enormous amounts of fly ash are 
generated and escape to the atmosphere, and thus, may cause 
polluting effects. Accordingly, in both aspects of solving 
the pollution problem through the reuse of the industrial 
waste materials and of developing substitute materials, 
measures have been steadily undertaken to reuse as much fly 
ash as possible. Prior art has sought ways of utilizing or disposing of  
 
the fly ash in a satisfactory manner through the following 
process. A process for the preparation of solid aggregate 
materials is disclosed in Japanese Patent Laid-Open No. Sho 
63-107853 that comprises pouring an admixture of fly ash and 
5 N concentration of NaOH water solution into a mold, 
pressuring the mixture with a high pressure air of about 300 
atm., and then heating at about 200 to 400°C for a water 
heating reaction and cooling in order to make heat-insulating 
panels. Another process is disclosed in Japanese Patent Laid-Open 
No. Sho 63-310716 that comprises autoclaving an admixture of 
50 g of fly ash and 50 ml of 1 to 4 N concentration NaOH or 
Na₂CO₃ water solution to extract SiO₂ from the fly ash in a 
form of water glass which is then recovered, cleaning remnant 
fly ash with water and drying subsequently, and curing with a 
cement curing agent. A similar technique is described in Japanese Patent Laid-Open 
No. Sho 64-90079 which comprises the water-heating 
reaction of about 70 to 80 % by weight of fly ash and about 30 
to 15% by weight of 5 N concentration NaOH water solution 
under the condition of above 100 kg/cm² of pressure and 200 to 
400°C of temp. and curing until solid aggregate materials are 
formed. And, a further process is described in International  
 
Patent Publication No. WO92/22514. As described, solid 
aggregate materials such landfill and bricks are produced by 
making use of fly ash in combination with NaOH, a water 
soluble silicate, water, a binder and other additives to 
prepare an admixture which is subsequently molded and then
