<ABSTRACT>
The present invention provides a frozen dough 
conditioner for preventing the freezing damages, such as 

reduced loaf volume of bread and deteriorated texture and 
taste, on the frozen dough caused in freezing and thawing 

processes. The invention is directed to a powdery or granule 
conditioner for frozen dough. The composition is prepared by 

spraying and drying an aqueous solution or dispersion having 
pH 4 through 9, wherein the aqueous solution or dispersion 

contains: (A) a sucrose fatty acid ester having HLB of not 
less than 5; (B) diacetyl tartaric acid monoglyceride; (C) 

a fatty acid monoglyceride; and (D) one or a plurality of 
sugars.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to frozen dough
conditioners for preventing the freezing damages on the frozen
dough caused in freezing and thawing processes.The frozen dough has been highly demanded with shortage
of hands and reduced working hours in the bread baking
industry and with needs of consumers for fresh-baked bread.Freezing and thawing processes give freezing damages,
such as reduced volume of bread and deteriorated texture and
taste, on the frozen dough. In order to find countermeasure
against the freezing damages, various studies including
development of freezing-resistant yeast have been undertaken.
Since there is a doubt of safety in potassium bromate
conventionally used as a dough conditioner composition,
L-ascorbic acid and other compounds are currently used as
conditioners though they do not have sufficient
effects. The newly developed conditioners are applied only
to pastries having relatively high freezing resistance like
Danish pastry. These conditioners cannot be used for breads
having a lean composition like French bread since such breads
have short shelf life and extremely low freezing resistance.Edible emulsifiers are known to have conditioning
effects. The emulsifiers improve the property of dispersing
and swelling of fats, oils, and other ingredients, and have 
appreciable interactions with lipids, starch, and proteins,
thereby exerting the conditioning effects in each process of
bread-making. More concretely, emulsifiers improve the
machine resistance of the dough, increase the loaf volume of
bread, and prevent excessive pores caused by freezing, thus
functioning to bake bread of fine texture and good taste. The
emulsifiers also improve shelf life.However, the emulsifiers conventionally used should be
pre-heated prior to dispersing or dissolving in water to make
its effects exerted. This requires time and labour, and
nevertheless the conventional emulsifiers do not have
sufficient conditioning effects.The object of the invention is to provide a frozen dough
conditioner for preventing the freezing damages on the frozen
dough caused in freezing and thawing processes.As a result of extensive study, the inventors have found
a frozen dough conditioner prepared by spraying and drying
specific edible emulsifiers and sugars. The invention is
directed to a powdery or granule conditioner for frozen dough.
The conditioner is prepared by spraying and drying an aqueous
solution or dispersion having pH 4 through 9, wherein the
aqueous solution or dispersion contains: (A) a sucrose fatty
acid
