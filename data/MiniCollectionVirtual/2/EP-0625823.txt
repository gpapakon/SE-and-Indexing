<ABSTRACT>
Semiconductor device including a UHF integrated circuit with at least one transistor stage equipped with a UHF matching circuit and with a direct-current bias circuit which are connected together at a junction node A, this stage being equipped moreover with stabilisation means comprising an open line applied to this junction node A. In this device, the open line applied to the junction node A is a quarter-wave line at the working frequency, so as to impose the presence of a short-circuit at this junction node A, and, at this junction node A, a stabilisation circuit is also applied, comprising a low-value resistor linked to earth in terms of UHF through a DC-isolating capacitor. For wideband applications, the quarter-wave open line is of radial type. Applications: telecommunications, MMICs.

<CLAIMS>
A semiconductor device including a microwave integrated circuit with at
least a transistor stage which comprises:


a microwave matching circuit (L1, L2) and a d.c. bias circuit (R1, C1) interconnected at
a link node A, and
and stabilizing means which include an open stub (SL) connected to this link node (A),
said open stub (SL) forming a (λ/4) stub having the nominal frequency to the transistor

stage (T) that imposes a short-circuit to ground on said link node (A) at said nominal
frequency,

characterized in that said stabilizing means include a stabilizing circuit comprising a
small resistor (R2) connected to ground in the microwave mode across a d.c. isolating

capacitor (C2) and connected to said link node (A),

and characterized in that at the nominal frequency, the d.c. bias circuit (R1, C1) and the
stabilizing circuit (R2, C2) are effectively isolated from the transistor stage (T) by means

of the short-circuit to ground imposed by said open stub (SL) and in that, at frequencies
different from the nominal frequency, the stabilizing circuit (R2) is effectively coupled

to the transistor stage (T) for short-circuiting in practice said link node (A) to ground
and preventing any oscillation.
A device as claimed in Claim 1, characterized in that the λ/4 open stub is
a radial stub.
A device as claimed in Claim 1 or 2, characterized in that the small
resistor has a value of the order of or less than 5Ω.
