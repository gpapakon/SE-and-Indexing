<ABSTRACT>
A method and apparatus for satellite station 
keeping is disclosed in which four thrusters (20-26) are 

mounted on the anti-nadir face of the satellite with 
their direction of thrust passing through the center 

of mass of the satellite. The thrust lines of the 
north pair of thrusters (20-22) and the south pair of 

thrusters (24-26) make an angle ϑ with the satellite north-south 
axis in a northern and southern direction 

respectively. The thrusters are laterally separated 
and slewed by an angle α about the north-south axis. 

Each thruster produces three components of ΔV, i.e. 
normal, tangential and radial (toward the Earth), 

thereby providing complete control of the three orbit 
vectors, inclination, eccentricity and mean motion. 

In the event of failure of a thruster, the thruster 
diagonally opposite the failed thruster is shutdown 

and the remaining diagonal pair of thruster is used to 
maintain station keeping.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a method of station keeping for
a three-axis stabilized satellite moving along an orbit about
the earth having an ascending node and a descending node, the
satellite comprising a north and a south pair of thrusters
mounted in a generally rectangular configuration on an anti-nadir
face of the satellite, the lines of thrust of each
thruster being directed through the center of mass of the satellite
and the pairs of thrusters being configured to comprise
a northwest thruster, a northeast thruster, a southwest
thruster and a southeast thruster , wherein:
the north pair and the south pair of thrusters are
canted away from the anti-nadir face in a north and
a south direction, respectively by a first predetermined
angle  from a north-south axis passing
through the center of mass of the satellite;the northeast and southeast thrusters are slewed in
an east direction about the north-south axis by a
second predetermined angle α and the northwest and
southwest thrusters are slewed in a west direction
about the north-south axis by the second predetermined
angle α;the south pair of thrusters is fired in a first position
near the descending node to produce a first
predetermined satellite velocity component ΔVN in a
normal direction; the north pair of thrusters is fired in a second position
near the ascending node to produce a second
predetermined satellite velocity component ΔVN in a
normal direction.A method of the afore-mentioned kind is disclosed in document

"ION PROPULSION - A TECHNOLOGY FOR IMPROVING THE COST-EFFECTIVENESS
OF LARGE COMMUNICATION SATELLITES".Synchronous satellites orbit the earth with the same revolution
rate as that of the earth. Accordingly, the satellite
appears above a fixed point on the earth. Hence, synchronous
satellites are often referred to as geostationary satellites
and operate within a stationary orbit. Synchronous satellites
are useful for many applications including weather and communication
applications.It is generally well-known in the art that various forces
act on synchronous satellites to move the satellite out of stationary
orbit. These forces are due to several sources including
the gravitational effects of the sun and moon, the elliptical
shape of the earth and solar radiation pressure. To counter
these forces, synchronous satellites are equipped with propulsion
systems that are fired at intervals in order to maintain
station in a
