<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates generally to computer systems
and more particularly to devices used to drive signals onto
and receive signals from a computer bus.As it is known in the art, computer systems generally
include a device referred to as a central processor unit
which is used to execute computer instructions to perform
some function. The central processing unit generally referred
to as a CPU communicates with other devices in the
computer system via a communications network generally referred
to as a computer bus or system bus. Other devices
commonly coupled to the system bus include memory systems
such as main memory and more persistent type of storage
systems such as magnetic disk type storage systems. These
devices including the CPU are generally not connected directly
to the system bus but rather are coupled to the bus
through a device called a bus interface. The bus interface device for a CPU may be quite different
than that for a main memory or for a magnetic disk device.
Moreover, for persistent storage such as magnetic
disk, an interface module called a I/O bus adapter is often
used to interface the system bus to an I/O bus (input/output
bus) to which are connected several disk storage devices.In general however, all of these interfaces on a particular
bus use a common set of devices called bus drivers
and bus receivers to send and receive logic signals with
proper voltage levels and appropriate drive capacity to
insure -reliable transfers of data on the bus.As it is also known, system buses generally carry
information including address information, control information,
and data. Buses transfer this information in a
logical manner as determined by the design of the system.
This logical manner is referred to as the bus protocol.
Buses can be so-called synchronous buses in which all transfers
are synchronized to a common timing signal referred to
as a clock signal or the buses can be asychronous buses in
which hand-shaking signals are used to transfer information
as quickly as possible.Several problems are associated with improving bus
performance whether the bus is synchronous or asychronous.
One problem that is common with system buses is that as CPUs
process information faster, it is necessary to provide a
concomitant increase in bus transfer rate to permit more 
address, control, and data to be transferred at correspondingly
faster rates on the bus so as not to obviate the
advantages obtained by use of a faster CPU. A characteristic
called cycle time gives an indication of the speed of a
bus.F
