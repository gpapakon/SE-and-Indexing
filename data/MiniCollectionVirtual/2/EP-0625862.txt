<ABSTRACT>
A network control apparatus having a coil (2) for 
performing a DC capture or the like of a communication 

line such as a telephone line for a communication 
terminal such as a facsimile apparatus for 

communicating a signal which was modulated in 
accordance with communication data is provided. A 

rectifying circuit such as a diode bridge is provided 
between a retardation coil for the DC capture and the 

communication line so that a current in the same 
direction always flows in the retardation coil for the 

DC capture irrespective of the polarity of the 
communication line. The apparatus comprises a data 

communication unit, a transformer provided in parallel 
between the retardation coil and the data communication 

unit, a capacitor provided in series between the 
retardation coil and the transformer, a shunt relay 

provided in parallel between the communication line and 
the rectifying circuit, a dial pulse generating relay 

provided in series between the communication line and 
the shunt relay, and a relay to connect a telephone or 

the rectifying circuit to the communication line.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a network control
apparatus for performing a direct current capture or
the like of a communication line for a communication
terminal to communicate the signal which was modulated
in accordance with communication data.Fig. 3 is a circuit diagram showing a construction
of a main section of a conventional network control
apparatus. A network control apparatus N is connected
to a terminal 7 to which a telephone line L is
connected. A main control unit 18 of a facsimile
apparatus is connected to the network control apparatus
N through a modem 15. A switching relay 4 is provided
on the terminal 7 side of the network control apparatus
N. A telephone T is connected to the switching relay 4
through a terminal 8. A detection circuit 16 to detect
a call signal is connected to the terminal 8. A spark
killer in which a capacitor 9, a resistor 10, and a
varistor 11 are mutually connected in parallel is
serially connected at the post stage of the relay 4,
thereby preventing the generation of a spark at the
time of operation of the facsimile apparatus.A pulse relay 5 is connected in parallel with the 
spark killer. A shunt relay 6 is connected in parallel
with the post stage of the pulse relay 5. A
retardation coil (RET coil) 2 is connected in parallel
with the post stage of the shunt relay 6. A blocking
capacitor 13 is serially connected to the post stage of
the RET coil 2.A primary winding of a transformer 3 is connected
to the post stage of the capacitor 13. A signal
processing circuit 14 to convert the signal level and
filter the signal is connected to both ends of a
secondary winding of the transformer 3. The modem 15
is connected to the signal processing circuit 14. A
main control unit 18 of the facsimile apparatus is
connected to the modem 15.The receiving operation of the conventional
facsimile apparatus with such a construction will now
be described. When the detection circuit 16 detects a
call signal, a detection signal is output from the
detection circuit 16. The switching relay 4 is
energized by the detection signal, so that its contact
is closed and the facsimile apparatus is set into a
receiving operation state.In the receiving operation state, an image signal
which is transmitted from a terminal on the partner
side through the telephone line L is input from the
terminal 7 through the switching relay 4 and pulse
relay 5. The input of the multiplexed DC component of 
the image signal to the transformer 3 is blocked by the
blocking capacitor 13. The DC component flows into
