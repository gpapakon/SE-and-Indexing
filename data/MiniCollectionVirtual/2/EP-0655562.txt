<ABSTRACT>
The improved slide bearing assembly comprises at least a 
shaft (10) and a bush (9) that is formed of a porous
 iron-base 
sintered material. The bush (9) is impregnated with a 

lubricant oil having a viscosity of 2.4 to 15 cm
2
/s. The 
bearing assembly can be operated in slow- and high-pressure 

applications without oil refillings for a prolonged period of 
at least several years. The shaft is preferably formed of an 

iron or a steel member that have been subjected to a treatment 
of surface modification. The slide bearing assembly is 

preferably used in such an environment that the working pressure 
applied to the sliding surface is at least 600 bar and 

that the sliding speed is in the range 2 - 5 cm/sec.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a slide bearing assembly and,
more particularly, to the use of a slide bearing assembly
in slow- and high-pressure applications without oil
refillings for a prolonged period.To operate the drive mechanism of excavators such as
construction machines, the respective parts of the mechanism
are coupled together in a rotatable or swingable manner so that
they can be driven with a cylinder and other actuators. Take,
for example, a hydraulic shovel having a bucket coupled to the
arm at the distal end. To perform excavation with the bucket,
the bucket cylinder is reciprocated so that the bucket rotates
or swings about the point where it is coupled to the arm. To
this end, the bucket is coupled to the arm by means of a slide
bearing assembly comprising a shaft and a bush.Fig. 14 is a cross-sectional view of a known slide
bearing assembly. As shown, a boss 1 has a bush 2 fitted
therein. A dust seal 3 is pressed against both ends of the
bush 2. A bracket 6 is provided at both ends of the boss 1 and
a shim 5 is inserted in the gap between the boss 1 and each
bracket 6. An O-ring 4 is fitted around each of the gaps. A
shaft 7 is inserted through the bracket 6 at one end, the bush
2 and the bracket 6 at the other end. The shaft 7 is prevented
from rotating by means of an engagement bolt 8 passing through
the shaft 7 and the bracket 6 at one end. A grease feed hole
30 is formed that runs from the other end of the shaft 7 to the
middle of the bush 2. A stopper 32 is threaded into one end of
the feed hole 30, which is filled with grease 34.During excavation, a slow but extremely large pressure is
applied to the surfaces of the slide bearing assembly. Under
the circumstances, the sliding surfaces must be amply supplied
with a thick lubricant such as grease in order to prevent the
occurrence of sticking, galling, uneven wear and other troubles
in early periods. To this end, frequent grease refillings are
necessary but the refilling operation is not always easy to
perform. Another problem with grease refilling is that the old
grease which has turned liquid must be discharged out of the
bearing before it is refilled with new grease. Such discharge
and refilling operations are usually performed at excavation
sites. The discharged liquid grease is disposed of by being
scattered over the surface of the soil at the site but this can
cause a pollution problem. With the recent concern over
environmental protection, it is particularly desired to refrain
from discarding or scattering the liquid grease over

Use of a slide bearing assembly, which comprises a shaft
(10) and a bush (9), the bush being formed of a porous iron-base

sintered material impregnated with lubricant oil having
a viscosity in the range from 2.4 to 15 cm
2
/s (240 to 1500
cSt) at 40°C, for swinging motions with a pressure of at

least 600 bar between the sliding surfaces and a sliding
speed of 2 to 5 cm/s, wherein a mechano-chemical reaction

product is formed between the sliding surfaces as a result of
the sliding of said shaft (10) relative to said bush (9).
