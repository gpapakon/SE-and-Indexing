<ABSTRACT>
The subject of the invention is a storage and dispensing (distribution) tube (C) for a product, for example a water-containing product which may be flavoured or perfumed, comprising a dispensing head which is fixed onto a flexible multilayer skirt, this skirt essentially containing an intermediate polymer layer (20) which has a barrier effect with respect to oxygen and flavours or perfumes, the said layer being sensitive to humidity, as well as, on each face of this intermediate layer, one or more polymer layers (1; 12,14,10) based on polyolefins, all of the said layers being bonded together in a continuous manner, characterised in that the set of layers situated on the inner face of the said intermediate layer having a barrier effect (1,21) has a total thickness of between 40 and 150 micrometres, so as better to conserve the flavour or the perfume which is or may be contained therein. This tube preferably includes one or two means which render the dispensing of the contained product easier and more complete. It applies to the industries for packaging products which are, for example, liquid, creamy or pasty.

<CLAIMS>
A tube (B, C, 34, 36) for the storage and distribution of a 
product which is for example flavoured or scented and which contains 

water, comprising a distribution head (38 and 35) which is feed on a 
flexible multi-layer skirt, said skirt essentially comprising an 

intermediate polymeric layer (20) with a barrier effect relative to 
oxygen and flavouring or scents, said layer being sensitive to 

moisture, and on each face of said intermediate layer one or are 
polymeric layers (1, 100, 13, 11 and 12, 14, 10) based on polyolefins, 

all said layers being continuously joined together, characterised in 
that the assembly of the layers which are disposed on the internal 

face of said intermediate barrier-effect layer (1, 21; 100, 13, 11, 
21) is of a total thickness of between 55 and 140 micrometres, so as 

better to preserve the flavouring or the scent of a product which is 
or may be contained therein. 
A tube according to clam 1 wherein said total thickness of the 
layers (1, 21; 100, 13, 11, 21) which are disposed on said internal 

face of the intermediate layer is between 65 and 130 micrometres. 
A tube according to either one of claims 1 and 2 wherein said 
polymeric layers based on polyolefins consist on the one hand of an 

internal surface layer of low density (1) or very low density or 
linear low density (100) polyethylene, of a specific mass of between 

0.86 and 0.93 g/cm
3
, and on the other hand other layers which are 
respectively either of low density polyethylene (LDPE) of a specific 

mass of between 0.90 and 0.93 g/cm
3
 or high density polyethylene 
(HDPE) of a specific mass of between 0.935 and 0.97 g/cm
3
 (13, 14). 
A tube (B, 34, 36) according to claim 3 wherein said layers of 
polyethylene contain one or more layers of HDPE (13, 14) of a total 

thickness which is at least equal to 90 micrometres.  
 
A tube according to claim 4 wherein said sum of the 
thicknesses of the layers of HDPE (13, 14) is between 100 and 140 

micrometres, the thickness of said skirt being between 260 and 380 
micrometres. 
A tube according to claim 4 wherein the sun of twice the 
thickness of said barrier layer (20) and said thicknesses of the 

layers of HDPE (13, 14) is between 130 and 180 micrometres, the 
thickness of said skirt being between 260 and 380 micrometres. 
A tube according to any one of claim 3 to 6 wherein said 
layers of polyethylene comprise a first layer (13) of HDPE which is 

inserted between said internal surface layer (100) and a first 
intermediate layer (11) of LDPE which is itself disposed on the 

interior of the intermediate barrier-effect layer (20). 
A tube according to any one of claims 3 to 7 wherein said 
layers of polyethylene comprise a second layer (14) of HDPE which is 

inserted between an external layer (10) of LDPE and a second 
intermediate layer (12) of LDPE which is itself disposed on the 

exterior of the intermediate barrier-effect layer (20). 
A tube according to either one of claims 7 and 8 wherein said 
first layer (13) of HDPE and/or said second layer (14) of HDPE is or 

are in a condition of continuity of fusion with said layers of LDPE 
(100, 11; 12, 10) between which it or they is or are inserted. 
A tube (B, 34, 36) according to claim 8 when appended to claim 
7 wherein the thicknesses of said first and second layers (13, 14) of 

HDPE are respectively between 10 and 50 micrometres and between 60 and 
140 micrometres.  

 
A tube (B, 34, 36) according to claim 10 wherein said first 
and second intermediate layers (11, 13) of LDPE are each joined to a 

face of said intermediate barrier-effect layer (20) by a bonding 
layer (21, 22) of EAA or EMA. 
A tube according to any one of claims 1 to 11 wherein said 
intermediate barrier-effect layer (20) of the skirt is of one of the 

materials of the group formed by: EVOH, PVOH, PA, and modified PA, 
and is of a thickness of between 0.01 and 0.05 mm. 
A tube (34, 36) according to any one of the preceding claims 
wherein said distribution head (38 and 35) comprises a neck (35) of 

smaller diameter than the skirt and an annular shoulder (38) 
connecting the neck (35) to the skirt, said shoulder being of a 

thickness of between 0.9 times and 1.35 times the thickness of the 
skirt and affording continuity of structure with said skirt and 

comprising folds which are squashed and welded to each other, said 
shoulder (38) being squashable laterally. 
A tube (36) according to claim 13 wherein the folds of said 
shoulder which are squashed and welded together contain folded and 

squashed prolongations (39, 41) of said intermediate barrier-effect 
layer (20) of the skirt.
