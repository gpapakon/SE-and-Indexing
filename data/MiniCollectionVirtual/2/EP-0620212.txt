<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to novel polyamines of the following composition: 
<
IMAGE
>
  where 1 
<
/= n 
<
/= 6,   R: is the hydrocarbon radical of a (cyclo)aliphatic or aromatic diisocyanate having 6-20 C atoms or its trimers, R
<
1
>
: if 2 
<
/= n 
<
/= 6, is an n-valent organic radical as is formed by removal of n OH groups from a polyhydroxy compound optionally containing ether oxygen atoms and having an average molecular weight of between 60 and 5000 or  if n = 1 is 
<

     It additionally relates to a process for the preparation of the polyamines, specific diisocyanates or adducts of diisocyanates with polyols or their trimers being reacted with the Schiff's base of the following composition: 
<

  where     R
<
2
>
 = H or C1-C8-alkyl and   R
<

>
 = C1-C8-(cyclo)alkyl, and after reaction has taken place the polyazomethine (poly-Schiff's bases) formed being completely hydrolysed with excess water and the carbonyl compound formed being distilled off. The polyamines according to the invention are employed for the hardening of epoxy resins.
