<ABSTRACT>
A plurality of comparators are arranged in 
parallel, and novel constructions are employed for 

emitter followers or like circuits of input circuits of 
the comparators or for reference voltage supplying 

circuits for use for those circuits, thereby to improve 
the differential linear distortion or some other 

characteristic and reduce noise without the input 
capa
citance. Further, an ECL circuit for use for signal 
processing is provided with a power saving function to 

reduce the power dissipation.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to an emitter follower circuit
which includes an emitter follower stage, a differentiation
circuit and a first current mirror circuit as specified in
the precharacterizing part of claim 1.An analog to digital converter of the parallel
comparison type called flash analog to digital converter
of the construction wherein a number of comparators,
which have comparison voltages of different voltage
values, equal to the number of bits of a digital signal
are arranged for collectively determining the comparison
voltages to find out a reference voltage equal to an
analog input voltage commonly employs, at an input stage
of each of the comparators, an emitter follower circuit
which has the characteristics that the input impedance 
is comparatively high and that it is superior in
interference suppressing capability for the preceding
and following stages.An example of the construction of an analog to
digital converter of the parallel comparison type is
shown in FIG. 1. Referring to FIG. 1, a reference
voltage generation circuit 1 includes, where a digital
signal is constituted from, for example, 8 bits, 256
resistors r1 to r256 connected in series, for example,
between lines VRT and VRB and generates reference
voltages of different voltage values at 255 junctions
between adjacent ones of the registers by potential
division of the resistors.The reference voltages serve as comparison
voltages for 255 comparators COP1, ... of a comparison
circuit 2. An analog input voltage VIN is inputted
commonly as an object voltage for comparison to the 255
comparators COP1, ... The 255 comparators COP1, ...
collectively determine one of the comparison voltages
which is equal to the input voltage VIN.The comparison outputs of the comparators COP1,
... are supplied by way of a gate circuit 3 to an
encoder 4, by which they are converted into a digital
signal D1 to D8 of 8 bits to be outputted. A conventional example of the circuit
construction of the comparators of the analog to digital
converter of the parallel comparison type described
above is shown in FIG. 2.Referring to FIG. 2, an NPN transistor Q1 of an
emitter follower to the base of which an analog input
voltage VIN is inputted, another NPN transistor Q2 to
the base of which a bias voltage VBIAS is inputted and a
resistor R1 are connected in series between a GND line
and a VEE line to construct an emitter follower stage 11
on the analog input side.A further NPN transistor Q3 of another emitter
follower to the base of which a reference voltage VREF
is
