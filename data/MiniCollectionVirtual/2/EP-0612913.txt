<ABSTRACT>
A connector assembly (26) for connecting coiled 
tubing (20) to downhole equipment in an earth well, includes 

a tubular housing (28) for connecting the coiled tubing (20) 
to the equipment, the housing including a bore for receiving 

fluid from the coiled tubing. At least one passage 
(28a,28c,28b,28d) extends through the housing (28) and 

communicates the bore with said well, and a valve (38a,38b) 
is provided for controlling the flow of fluid through the 

passage between the housing (28) and the well. The assembly 
can accommodate an elongated member, such as an electrical 

cable, or the like.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a connector 
assembly for connecting coiled tubing to a tool for 
operating in an oil and gas earth well and, more 
particularly, to such an assembly for selectively 
controlling the flow of fluid from the coil tubing into the 
well. In the operation of subterranean oil and gas earth 
wells, it is often necessary to perform several downhole 
operations in the well. To this end, many different types 
of downhole tools have evolved which often are inserted in 
the well by wireline to a predetermined depth where they 
perform their functions. Coiled tubing is now often being used in these 
types of downhole applications in place of the wireline 
since the coiled tubing has several advantages. For 
example, coiled tubing can traverse highly deviated or 
horizontal wells and fluids or gases can be discharged 
through the coiled tubing and into the well for various 
purposes such as actuating hydraulic equipment, cleaning 
and/or replacing any fluids displaced as a result of the 
insertion of the coiled tubing and the associated tool, etc. 
Also, radioactive fluids, foam, paraffin, nitrogen, mud, 
corrosion inhibitors, spotting acid, cement, and the like, 
can be introduced into the well for performing various 
functions. Further, in certain circumstances, fluid, such 
as water, can be circulated through the coiled tubing to 
maintain a pressure balance across the wall of the coiled  
 
tubing when well fluids are acting on the outer surface of 
the wall. In order to provide for discharge of the fluid or 
gas into the wellbore, a tubular adapter- or housing is 
usually connected between the coiled tubing and the downhole 
tool. One or more passages are provided through the wall of 
the adapter for receiving the fluid or gas from the coiled 
tubing and discharging it into the wellbore. For example, 
in our U.S. patent specification no. 5,040,598, a pulling 
tool is disclosed which is connected to reeled, or coiled, 
tubing by an assembly including an inner mandrel and a 
tubular core. A plurality of angularly spaced passages 
extend through the core for discharging fluid from the bore 
of the core externally of the core. However, in situations 
when the wellbore often contains fluid or gas under 
pressure, the fluids or gas could escape through the passage 
in the adapter and backflow through the coiled tubing to the 
ground surface. This, of course, could present a safety 
hazard, especially in the event of failure of any of the 
above-ground equipment. The above problem is

<CLAIMS>
A connector assembly (26) for use with coiled 
tubing (20) in an earth well, said assembly comprising a 

tubular housing (28) for connecting said coiled tubing 
relative to equipment for operating in said well so that 

operating fluid from above ground can pass through said 
coiled tubing and into the bore of said housing, passage 

means (28a,28c;28b,28d) extending through said housing (28) 
and communicating said bore with said well, and valve means 

(34a,34b) associated with said passage means (28a,28c; 
28b,28d) for controlling the flow of fluid between said bore 

and said well. 
An assembly according to claim 1 wherein said 
valve means (34a,34b) is arranged normally to prevent the 

flow of well fluid from said well, through said passage 
means (28a,28c,28b,28d) and into said bore, and to respond 

to a predetermined pressure of said operating fluid in said 
bore for permitting the flow of said operating fluid from 

said bore, through said passage means (28a,28c,28b,28d) and 
into said well. 
An assembly according to claim 1 or 2, wherein 
said passage means (28a,28c,28b,28d) extends from the inner 

surface of said bore to the outer surface of said housing 
and wherein said valve means comprise at least one passage 

extending through the wall of said housing (28). 
An assembly according to claim 1, 2 or 3, wherein 
said passage means (28a,28c,28b,28d) comprise at least one 

passage extending through the wall of said housing (28). 
An assembly according to claim 1, 2, 3 or 4, 
wherein said valve means (34a,34b) comprises a ball valve 

and spring means (36a,36b) for urging said ball valve to 
 

said flow-preventing position in said passage (28a,28c, 
28b,28d). 
An assembly according to any of claims 1 to 5, 
wherein there are two diametrically opposed passages 

(28a,28c;28b,28d) formed through said housing wall and two 
ball valves (34a;34b) respectively associated with said 

passages. 
An assembly according to any of claims 1 to 6, 
wherein said housing (2
8) is connected to said coiled tubing 
(20), and wherein an elongated member (32) extends through 

said coiled tubing (20) and said bore of said housing (28) 
for connection to said equipment. 
An assembly according to claim 7, wherein said 
elongated member (32) is a data transmission line, a power 

transmission line, or a fluid transmission line. 
An assembly according to claim 7 or 8, wherein the 
housing is connected to equipment for working in the well. 
The use of a connector assembly (26) as claimed in 
any of claims 1 to 6, for connecting coiled tubing (20) to 

downhole equipment and for controlling flow of fluid from 
the tubing (20) into the well.
