<ABSTRACT>
A tongue-like portion (14) is formed in one end 
portion (12) of a base (10) to extend toward an end of 

the one end portion. A wristwatch (23) having a paired 
watchbands (24, 27) with a band keeper (25) being 

provided on one band, is placed on the base, and the 
tongue is inserted into an opening of the keeper through 

a gap of the keeper and the one watchband. A pillow 
portion (15) is formed in the one end portion at a 

region nearer to the end of the one end portion than the 
tongue. The pillow covers the tongue, and an extending 

end of the one watchband lays on the pillow in a longitudinal 
direction of the base.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a packaging
structure for preventing an article which is placed on a
base from displacing on the base.FIG. 11 shows a conventional packaging structure
for packaging a wristwatch. In FIG. 11, the packaging
structure is constructed by arranging a wristwatch 4
with a pair of wristbands in a recess 3 formed in an
upper surface 2 of a base 1 made of a paper tray and an
unexpanded plastic tray or an expanded polystyrene
block, and by inserting the base 1 into a clear case 5 a
front portion of which faces the wristwatch 4 is
transparent.According to the above-mentioned packaging
structure, the wristwatch can be protected by the
base 1 during transportation and can be displayed by
hanging an upper end portion of the clear case on a
peg-like hook member in a display corner.In the conventional packaging structure, the recess
3 of the base 1 must be formed to correspond to a shape
and size of the wristwatch 4 with a pair of wristbands.
Therefore, many types of bases 1 having recesses 3 of
different shapes and sizes must be prepared. This leads
to a rise in a cost of packaging. Further, since the
wristwatch 4 is only set in the recess 3 of the base 1,
the wristwatch 4 is displaced out of the recess 3 when
great vibration is applied to the packaging structure 
during transportation. This injuries an outer appearance
of those packaged articles when these packaging
structures are displayed.It is known from document GB-A-1 135 339 to attach watchbands
by providing runners which are moveable in longitudinal slots
wherein one runner comprises a hook for receiving and holding
one end of a watchband and the other runner, which is
positioned in the other slot at the outer end of a storage
container, comprises a clasp.This invention is derived from the above described
circumstances, an object of the present invention is to
provide a packaging structure which can be used commonly
for different kinds of articles of various shapes and
sizes, prevent an article placed on a base from displacing
out of a predetermined position on the base, lowers a
cost of packaging and can maintain a good outer
appearance.In order to achieve the above-mentioned object, the
packing structure of the present invention is so made
that a tongue-like portion is formed in one end portion
of a base to extend toward this end of the
one end portion, the base having an upper surface on
which an article having a circular portion may be placed,
and the tongue-like portion is insertable into an opening
of the circular member of

characterized in that an extending end (30) of the

tongue-like portion (14) is bent in a side of the
surface (16) of the base (10) in an upright position

after the tongue-like portion (14) is inserted into
the opening of the circular member (25), and the bent

extending end (30) prevents the article (23) from
displacing toward the extending end (30) of the base

(10).

characterized by further comprising a pillow portion

(15) provided in a region of the one end portion (12) 
of the base (10) which is located nearer to the end

of the end one portion (12) than the tongue-like
portion (14), and preventing the bent extending end

(30) of the tongue-like portion (14) from lying flat.
