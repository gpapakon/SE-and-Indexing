<ABSTRACT>
The present invention relates to a device for fastening and quick three-dimensional adjustment of any component on a support. This device comprises a first washer (4) equipped on one face with an axially split hollow shaft (5) which can be mounted on a stud (1) and interact with it, as well as a second washer (9) mounted freely on the hollow shaft (5), this hollow shaft (5) being externally threaded (10) and bearing a nut (8) which, when tightened, allows the component to be fastened between the two washers (4, 9) and on the stud (1) at the chosen position and which, when slackened off, allows the component (3) to be adjusted by shifting it in a plane between the two washers (4, 9) and by shifting the washers (4, 9) - nut (8) assembly along the stud (1), that is to say in a direction orthogonal to the said plane. The device of the invention applies for example to the fitting of head lamps on a motor vehicle.

Device for a fastening and a three-dimensionally quick
adjusting of any work piece (3) on a pin shaped support

(1) or the like, and of the type comprising a first
washer (4) one of the faces of which is provided with an

axially slit shaft (5) able to be mounted on the pin (1)
and to cooperate therewith, which shaft (5) is outwardly

threaded (10) and carries a nut (8) which, upon
tightening, enables the fastening of the work piece (3)

on the pin (1) at the chosen position and which, upon
untightening, enables an adjustment of the work piece (3)

by moving it in a plane between the first washer (4) and
the nut (8) and, by moving the washer (4) - nut (8) unit

on the pin (1), i.e. according to a direction that is
orthogonal to said plane, characterized in that it

comprises a second washer (9) that is freely mounted on
the shaft (5) of the first washer (4) so that the work

piece (3) is tightened between the two washers (4, 9),
and in that the shaft (5) of the first washer (4) is

innerly provided with asperities (7), such as for example
a threading, able to permit to hook the shaft (5) on a

pin (1), that is outerly provided with asperities (1a),
after screwing the nut (8), as well as the relative

displacement of the shaft (5) on the pin (1) after
unscrewing the nut (5).
Device according to claim 1, characterized in that the
outer threading (10) of the shaft (5) is interrupted on

the side of the free end of the shaft for forming an
outerly smooth annular area (11) for receiving the nut

(5) after unscrewing. 
Device according to claim 2, characterized in that the
free end of the shaft (5) of the first washer (4)

comprises a rim (12) for retaining the nut (8) in an
inactive position in said annular area (11).
Device according to one of the preceding claims,
characterized in that said work piece (3) comprises a

hole (3a) of a size that is greater than the outer
diameter of the shaft (5) belonging to the first washer

(4).
