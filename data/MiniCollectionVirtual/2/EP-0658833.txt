<ABSTRACT>
The device according to the invention for guiding the technical process contains a device for the cyclic detection of sets of measured values of the on-line process measured values of the operating means of the technical process. The on-line process measured values are stored in a first memory. A further device serves for the cyclic detection of sets of measured values of the off-line process measured values of the technical process at a sampling rate which is reduced in comparison with the detection of the on-line process measured values. These (off-line process measured values) include at least the characteristics of the final product. A case generator assigns to each set of measured values of the off-line process measured values sets of measured values of the on-line process measured values, which were stored in the period of time in which the characteristic of the final product was decisively influenced in the corresponding operating means. From this, by means of mathematical operations, compressed sets of assigned measured values are formed and are stored in a third memory. A case selector finally transmits the set of assigned measured values as desired values to operating means with which actual production targets can be reached.

Apparatus for controlling an industrial process 
with 


a) an apparatus for the cyclical acquisition of sets 
of measurements of the on-line process measurements 

of items of the industrial process, 
b) a first memory for the on-line process 
measurements, 
c) an apparatus for the cyclical acquisition of sets 
of measurements of the off-line process 

measurements of the industrial process which 
comprise at least the parameters of the end product 

at a scanning rate which is reduced in comparison 
with the acquisition of the on-line process 

measurements, 
d) a case generator which 

d1) allocates to each set of measurements of the 
off-line process measurements the sets of 

measurements of the on-line process measurements 
from the first memory which have been stored in the 

first memory in a period when an intermediate 
product of the industrial process passed through 

the item through whose influence the characteristic 
values of the end product have been decisively 

influenced, and 
d2) compresses the associated sets of measurements 
of the on-line process measurements by means of 

smoothing mathematical operations to a set of 
allocation values pertaining to the respective set 

of measurements of the off-line process  
 

measurements and files them in a third memory, and 
with 
e) a case selector which delivers a set of allocation 
values as manipulated variables to items of the 

industrial process with which current existing 
production targets can be achieved. 
Apparatus according to Claim 1, wherein the sets of 
measurements of the off-line process measurements 

contain parameters of the starting materials in addition 
to the parameters of the end product. 
Apparatus according to Claim 1 or 2, wherein the 
sets of measurements of the off-line process 

measurements additionally contain load and economic 
efficiency characteristic values. 
Apparatus according to one of the preceding claims, 
with a further memory in which, for each item of the 

industrial process, the average dwell times which an 
intermediate requires in order to pass from the 

respective item to the end of the industrial process as 
an end product are entered, and these average dwell 

times are used by the case generator to form the sets of 
allocation values. 
Apparatus according to one of the preceding claims, 
with a case classifier which divides the value ranges of 

off-line and/or on-line process measurements into 
segments with selected range widths, replaces a process 

measurement by a centre of gravity value of the 
associated segment and, in this way, reduces the sets of 

allocation values contained in the third memory to 
classified sets of allocation values with which an end 

product having clearly specified characteristic values  
 

can be reproducibly manufactured after being delivered 
by the case selector. 
Apparatus according to Claim 5, wherein the 
segments of a value range have different range widths.
