<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to novel azo compounds useful
as dyestuffs and to their preparation and use. The compounds
of the invention are particularly useful for dyeing paper and
other cellulosics.Dyestuffs based on aminonaphtholsulfonic acids, such
as "J acid", are known. E.g., H.M. Parmelee, "Naphthalene
Intermediates" in The Chemistry of Synthetic Dyes and Pigments,
American Chemical Society Monograph Series, edited by H.A. Lubs
(Malabar, Florida: Robert E. Krieger Publishing Company,
1955), pages 88-91. Azo dyestuffs based on dehydrothic-p-toluidinesulfonic
acid ("DHTPTSA") are also known. E.g, U.S.
Patent 5,173,086. The structural features of both starting
materials have not previously been combined in a single azo
dyestuff. Azo dyestuffs which contain a phenylbenzothiazole
moiety are known from FR-A 2 536 082.It has now been found that azo compounds prepared
from certain aminonaphtholsulfonic acids and DHTPTSA (and
derivatives thereof) provide red dyestuffs having excellent
coloristic and dyeing properties for cellulosic materials.This invention relates to azo compounds useful as a
dyestuff having the formula (I)

wherein
R1is C1-C6 alkyl, C5-C8 cycloalkyl, halogen, or nitro;R2 and R3are independently hydrogen, C1-C6 alkyl, C5-C8
cycloalkyl, C6-C10 aryl, C7-C16 aralkyl, C2-C6 alkanoyl, 
(C5-C8 cycloalkane)carbonyl, or C7-C11 aroyl;R4is hydrogen, C1-C6 alkyl, or C2-C6 alkanoyl; andMn+is
(a) RaRbRcRdN+, wherein Ra, Rb, Rc, and Rd are
independently hydrogen, C1-C6 alkyl, or C2-C6
hydroxyalkyl,(b) 1/n moles of an n-valent metal ion per mole of the
azo compound, or(c) H+.The color properties of the dyestuffs of formula (I)
of the invention can be varied somewhat by varying the
substituents R1, R2, R3, and R4 and, in some cases, the ionic
cations Mn+. In general, however, the dyestuffs are red.The term "C1-C6 alkyl" refers to straight or branched
chain aliphatic hydrocarbon groups having from 1 to 6 carbon
atoms. Examples of C1-C6 alkyl are methyl, ethyl, propyl,
butyl, pentyl, hexyl, and the isomeric forms thereof.The term "C2-C6 hydroxyalkyl" refers to straight or
branched chain aliphatic hydrocarbon groups having from 2 to 6
carbon atoms and substituted with a hydroxy group. Examples of
C2-C6 hydroxyalkyl are hydroxyethyl, hydroxypropyl, hydroxybutyl,
hydroxypentyl, hydroxyhexyl, and isomeric forms thereof.The term "C5-C8 cycloalkyl" refers to cycloaliphatic
hydrocarbon groups having from 5 to 8 carbon atoms. Examples
of C5-C8 cycloalkyl are cyclopentyl, cyclohexyl, cycloheptyl,
and cyclooctyl.The term
