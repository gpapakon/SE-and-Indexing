<ABSTRACT>
A compressed-air-operated percussion mechanism includes a housin g (1), a percussion body (2) and a balancing body (3). Between said bodies there is an operating chamber (11) in which an inlet passage (8) emerges for the supply of high-pressure air to the chamber with the purpose of separating the bodies against the action of spring means (23, 58). A primary valve device (45) is separated from the operating chamber (11). Between the percussion and balancing bodies (2, 3) a secondary valve device (38) is acting, said device (38) on one hand keeping the operating chamber sealed during the operating stroke and on the other hand after the termination of an operating stroke opens the chamber to evacuate compressed air therein. The primary valve device (45) includes a valve element (51) that is movable between opening and closing positions and is kept in opening position by a first force generated by input high-pressure air, said element (51) being guided to a closing position by a counter-acting second force that is able to overcome the first force, said second force being generated by evacuated low-pressure air.

<DESCRIPTION>
COMPRESSED-AIR-OPERATED PERCUSSION MECHANISMTechnical Field of the InventionThis invention relates to a compressed-air-operated per- cussion mechanism including a housing and two bodies movable axially to-and-fro therein, i.e. a first body or percussion body and a second body or balancing body for the purpose of outbalancing the striking movements of the percussion body and thus de-vibrate the entire mechanism, an operating chamber defined between said bodies, an inlet passage emerging in said operating chamber for supplying compressed air, below called high-pressure air, to the chamber for the purpose of separat¬ ing, against the action from spring means, the bodies from each other while executing an operating stroke, wherein compressed air of reduced pressure, below called low-pressure air, is evacuated from the operating chamber to at least one outlet during a return stroke, said supply of high-pressure air to the operating chamber being regulated by an intermittently opening, primary valve device. Percussion mechanisms of this type are in practice used for devices of quite different types within quite different areas. As an example ram devices, hand tools for drilling, chiselling, engraving, hammering and surface treatment, devices for vibrating screens, feeding chutes and the like may be men- tioned. An especially frequent field of use for the percussion mechanisms is as driving arrangements for chisel or needle sealers .Since the percussion mechanisms require quick sequences of operation they are fed pneumatically, i.e. by compressed air.Prior ArtA percussion mechanism of the type defined in the pream¬ ble is previously known in different versions from SE 9203456-0 and SE 9403729-8. In practice this known percussion mechanism operates with a primary valve device in the shape of a spigot connected with the percussion body, said spigot being movable through a through-going hole in an end wall of the balancing body. The spigot has on one hand a thin shank and on the other 

hand a thickened end portion having a diameter corresponding with the diameter of the hole in the end wall. When the percus¬ sion and balancing bodies are approached to each other and the operating chamber has a minimal volume, the high-pressure air in an inlet passage in the balancing body is allowed to flow into the operating chamber in order to initiate the operating stroke. When the bodies are distanced from each other to a cer¬ tain degree the thickened end portion of the spigot is however entered into the hole in the end

2. Percussion mechanism according to claim l, c h a r a c t e ¬ r i z e d in that the primary valve device (45) includes at least two axially separated, radial holes (48, 49) through which high-pressure air may flow radially between on one hand a by-pass passage (50) common for both holes and on the other 


hand each one of two different sections (8' , 8") of the inlet passage (8) , and that the valve element is constituted of an axially to-and-fro movable slide element (51) that in a first end position keeps both of the radial holes (48, 49) open and thus allows high-pressure air to flow from a first passage sec¬ tion (8') to a second one (8") , via the by-pass passage (50) , and in an opposite second end position closes at least one of the holes and thus makes it impossible for high-pressure air to flow from the first section to the second one.
