<ABSTRACT>
This patent discloses a secondary fluid supply 
system
 for a steam generator (1) used in nuclear reactor 
power plants. The secondary fluid supply system comprises 

a secondary fluid (feedwater) inlet nozzle (14) near the 
base of the steam generator shell (2), a feedwater riser 

pipe (15) spaced between the shell of the steam generator 
and the tube bundle wrapper (16), the upper end of the 

feedwater riser pipe being connected to a distribution ring 
(17) having a plurality of spray nozzles positioned in the 

recirculating pool (28) above the top of the U-shaped heat 
exchanger tubes.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to steam generators used in 
nuclear reactor power plants. It relates particularly to 
a secondary fluid supply system used to introduce the 
feedwater into the steam generator. Steam generators used in nuclear reactor power 
plants are very large heat exchangers where heat from a 
primary fluid heated by the nuclear reactor is transferred 
to a secondary fluid (water) which is converted into steam 
and used to drive a turbine generator. Steam generators 
are housed inside a tall, generally cylindrical steel 
shell. A large number of U-shaped heat exchanger tubes are 
enclosed in the shell and have their ends inserted in holes 
formed in a horizontal tube sheet or plate near the bottom 
of the steel shell. The tubes are used to convey the 
primary fluid which has been heated in the nuclear reactor. 
The secondary fluid or feedwater used to generate the steam 
is introduced into steam generator in such a manner that 
the secondary fluid flows around the outside of the heated 
tubes thereby converting much of the secondary fluid into 
steam which is allowed to exit the steam generator through 
an outlet nozzle at the top of the steel shell. Many early model steam generators (often called 
preheat steam generators or steam generators with economizers) 
were designed to introduce the secondary fluid or 
feedwater through a feedwater inlet nozzle positioned near 
the bottom of the steam generator where it was introduced 
directly to the tube bundle. The incoming secondary fluid  
 
then rose upwardly around the tubes where it was heated and 
converted into steam. The secondary fluid that was not yet 
converted into steam was captured by the moisture separators 
and redirected into a steam generator recirculating 
pool. Recirculating water from this pool flowed down 
between the tube bundle wrapper and the inside wall of the 
steel shell to the bottom of the steam generator where it 
was directed back into the tube bundle where it then was 
mixed with additional incoming secondary fluid or 
feedwater. Other designs of steam generators (often called 
feedring steam generators or non-preheat steam generators) 
have been designed with the feedwater inlet nozzle positioned 
in the upper part of the steam generator to introduce 
the secondary fluid or feedwater into the recirculation 
pool where it mixes with the recirculating water 
before flowing down between the tube bundle wrapper and the 
inside wall of the steel shell to the bottom of the steam 
generator where it is directed back into

<CLAIMS>
In a steam generator (1) comprised of a 
generally cylindrical steel shell (2) containing a plurality 

of U-shaped heat exchanger tubes (11) connected to a 
heated primary fluid inlet and outlet in the base of the 

steel shell and having a steam outlet (27) at the top of 
the steel shell, the improvement being a secondary fluid 

supply system comprising a secondary fluid inlet nozzle 
(14) in the steel shell near the base thereof and connected 

to a riser pipe (15) spaced between an inside surface of 
the steel shell and a cylindrical tube bundle wrapper (16) 

and connected to a distribution ring (17) positioned in an 
upper recirculating pool (28) above the top of the U-shaped 

heat exchanger tubes, said distribution ring having a 
plurality of spray nozzles adapted to introduce the secondary 

fluid into the recirculating pool. 
The secondary fluid supply system of Claim 1 
in which said riser pipe is restrained laterally by one or 

more lateral support means (19) secured to the inside 
surface of the steel shell. 
The secondary fluid supply system of Claim 2 
in which the lateral support means comprises parallel 

plates (21,22) on either side of said riser pipe and 
provided with wedge shaped bearing pads (23). 
The secondary fluid supply system of Claim 1 
in which a steel wrapper (16) is positioned between the 

riser pipe and the U-shaped heat exchanger tubes.
