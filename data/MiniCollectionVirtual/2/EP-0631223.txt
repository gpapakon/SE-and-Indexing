<ABSTRACT>
A data processing system is comprised of a display; a cursor control 
means connected to the display for displacement of a cursor represented on the display; 

and a user-interface means coupled to the cursor control means for user-manipulation of 
the cursor via the cursor control means. The cursor control means is operative to 

displace the cursor at a relatively low speed relative to the display during a 
predetermined time interval upon activation of the user-interface means and to displace 

the cursor at a relatively high speed after the predetermined time interval has elapsed.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a data processing system comprising a display, a
cursor control means connected to the display for displacement of a cursor represented
on the display; and a user-interface means being coupled to the cursor control means for
user-manipulation of the cursor via the cursor control means. In particular, the
invention relates to a CD-I system.Systems as mentioned in the preamble, among which CD-I systems in
particular, are widely known. With the advent of CD-I there has been created a
considerably user-friendly medium, which enables interactive handling of information in
an ergonomic manner. CD-I systems are particularly, but not exclusively, designed for
consumer applications in domestic environments. CD-I applications, e.g., software on
compact disc information carriers, are available in a large variety of titles, ranging from
video games and reference books to teaching and training applications. User-interface
aspects are considered among the key issues that govern the wide acceptance of CD-I.
For further information on technical issues, see "Compact Disc-Interactive;
A
Designer's Overview", Kluwer, Nov. 1988, ISBN 9020121219.In many program applications, user-interaction with the data processing
system is achieved through cursor control. A cursor is a figure, which is displayed on
the display screen and whose position can be changed relative to the screen by the user
manipulating the user-interface means, e.g., a manoeuvring device. The user moves the
cursor across the screen as in a video game, or positions the cursor in a particular area
shown on the screen, e.g., to select a particular program option as in a menu. The user-interface
means may be provided with a manoeuvring functionality such as, for
example, a plurality of buttons, each for control of the cursor movement in a particular
direction, a joy-stick, or a single thumb-controlled button for selective multiple-direction
control of the cursor. The inventors have found that in conventional systems the cursor speed within a
single application is some sort of a compromise, i.e., either it is too low for rapidly transferring
the cursor over large distances, leading to a tedious behaviour of the system, or too high for
accurate positioning, resulting in a rather difficult manipulation of the cursor homing-in on a
chosen target.It is an object of the invention to provide a data processing system of the kind cited in
the preamble, in particular a CD-I system, whose cursor positioning control is more user-friendly
and whose

<CLAIMS>
A data processing system being comprised of:

a display (102);
a cursor control means (110) connected to the display for displacement of a cursor
represented on the display;
a user-interface means (106) being coupled to the cursor control means for user-manipulation
of the cursor via the cursor control means;

characterized in that
the user-interface means comprise user-operable means (402, 404, 406, 408) for varying the
speed of said displacement within a speed range which is limited by an upper speed (v1, v2)

limit,
the cursor control means is operative to set the upper speed limit at a relatively low speed
relative to the display during a predetermined time interval (t1, t2) upon activation of the user-interface

and set the upper speed limit at a relatively high speed after the predetermined time
interval has elapsed.
The system of claim 1, wherein the user-interface means (106) is operative to
control the cursor control means (110) by transmitting data effecting the relatively low speed

(v1) to the cursor control means during the predetermined time interval (t1), and by
transmitting data effecting the relatively high speed (v2) to the cursor control means after the

predetermined time interval has elapsed.
The system of claim 1, wherein data transmission from the user-interface (106)
to the cursor control means (110) involves a temporal basis in terms of repetitive events, and

wherein the cursor control means or the user-interface is operative to measure the
predetermined time interval in terms of a number of the events.
The system of claim 3, wherein a respective one of the repetitive events
involves a respective update of a cursor position, and wherein the relatively low speed is 

effected by a relatively short displacement of the cursor per update, and wherein the relatively
high speed is effected by a relatively large displacement of the cursor per update.
The system of claim 1, wherein the user-interface means (106) is operative to
render at least the relatively low speed (v1) or the relatively high speed (v2) variable in

response to the user manipulating the user-interface.
The system of claim 3, wherein the cursor control means (110) or the user-interface

means (106) is provided with a resettable counting means (440) to count the number
of events elapsed since the user-interface was last activated.
The system of claim 1 or 3, comprising a CD-I system.
A user-interface means adapted for use in the system of claim 2, 5 or 6.
