<ABSTRACT>
A trailer, in particular for transporting containers, comprising a front 
chassis (2) which has a set of wheels and is to be coupled to a tractor 

unit, a rear chassis (3), which has a set of wheels and is to be coupled 
to the front chassis, and coupling means (4) for rigidly coupling the 

front and rear chassis to one another. The wheels of the set of wheels on 
the front chassis (2) can be lifted off the road and/or can hinge freely 

about a vertical swivel. An accommodating sleeve (12) (female coupling 
element) is fixed to the front chassis (2) for coupling with the rear 

chassis (3), which sleeve does not protrude with respect to the rear of 
the front chassis. The rear chassis (3) has at least two sets of wheels 

as well as a push-in component (9) (male coupling element) which 
protrudes forwards with respect to the front of the rear chassis and can 

be pushed into the accommodating sleeve (12) of the front chassis. The 
accommodating sleeve (12) and the push-in component (9) are provided with 

various openings (15, 16; 17), which can be brought into register with 
one another to allow the passage of a coupling pin or bolt. By this means 

the two chassis can at least be coupled in a first position, in which the 
combination is suitable for transporting a 40' container and two 20' 

containers, and in a second position, in which the combination is 
suitable for transporting a 45' container.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to an articulated vehicle trailer, in particular 
for transporting containers, comprising a front chassis which has a set 
of wheels and is to be coupled to a tractor unit, a rear chassis which 
has a set of wheels and is to be coupled to the front chassis, coupling 
means for rigidly coupling the front and rear chassis to one another, 
said coupling means comprising an accommodating sleeve acting as female 
coupling element fixed to the front chassis and not protruding with 
respect to the rear of said front chassis, and a push-in component 
acting as male coupling element protruding forwards with respect to the 
front of said rear chassis and meant to be pushed into the accommodating 
sleeve, whereby the wheels of the set of wheels on the front chassis may 
have such a position or mounting that the trailer can take a bend with 
appreciable speed without difficulty, one of the possibilities to obtain 
this being the free hinging of these wheels about a vertical king pivot. A trailer of this type is disclosed in US-A-3481629. The trailers seen in practice are mainly trailers which comprise a single 
mobile chassis which is suitable for transporting either a single large 
container (40' or 45') or a medium size container (30') or two small 
containers (20'). In the case where two 20' containers are transported, 
the container which is located closest to the tractor unit of the trailer 
can be unloaded only after the other container has been removed. 
Simultaneous unloading of the two small containers would be possible only 
if the rearmost container were to be placed on a separate vehicle which 
brings said container with its end section to be opened to the unloading 
location. In practice what it comes down to is that the two small 
containers are unloaded one after the other, which incurs loss of time. If a combination of two chassis according to said US-A-3481629 would be 
used for transporting two small containers, simultaneous unloading of the 
two containers could take place without any problem. However the coupling 
means only permit coupling of the two chassis to one another by the ends 
facing one another so that the maximum longitudinal dimension of the 
coupled chassis is fixed. If said dimension is 40', a 45' container can 
not be transported with this construction.  
 The aim of the invention is to overcome this disadvantage and to this end 
the trailer mentioned in the preamble is characterised in that the rear 
chassis has at least two sets of wheels, in that in

and is to be coupled to a tractor unit, a rear chassis (3) which has a

means (4) for rigidly coupling the front and rear chassis to one

without difficulty, one of the possibilities to obtain this being the 

free hinging of these wheels about a vertical king pivot, 
characterized in that the rear chassis has at least two sets of 

wheels, in that in addition or in stead of the free hinging of the 
wheels of the set of wheels on the front chassis, these wheels could 

be lifted off the road, and in that the accommodating sleeve (12) and 
the push-in component (9) are provided with various openings (15, 16; 

17), which can be brought into register with one another to allow the 
passage of a coupling pin or coupling bolt, in such a way that the two 

chassis can at least be coupled in a first position, in which the 
combination is suitable for transporting a 40' container and two 20'

suitable for transporting a 45' container. 
Trailer according to Claim 1, characterised in that further 
openings are provided in the push-in component (9) and the 

accommodating sleeve (12) in order to bring the chassis apart into a 
Customs position in which access can be obtained to a container 

located on the front chassis. 
Trailer according to Claim 1, characterised in that openings are 
present in the push-in component (9) and the accommodating sleeve (12) 

in order to move the chassis into a position with respect to one  
 

another such that two rail containers each having a length of about 
7.15 metres can be transported.
