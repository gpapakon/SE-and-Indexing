<ABSTRACT>
The invention provides new compounds of formula (I) wherein n is an integer of 1 to 4; each of R and R1, which may be the same or different, is hydrogen, halogen, trifluoromethyl or C1-C4 alkoxy; R2 is hydrogen or C1-C4 alkyl; and a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof; and wherein when, at the same time, R is hydrogen, R1 is hydrogen or halogen and n is one, then R2 is other than hydrogen or methyl; and of formula (IA) wherein R3 is halogen, and a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof, which are active on the central nervous system (CNS) and can be used in therapy as anti-epileptics, anti-Parkinson, neuroprotective, antidepressant, anti-spastic and hypnotic agents.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to substituted (phenylalkylaminobenzyl)aminopropanamide 
derivatives, to their 
use as therapeutic agents, to a process for their 
preparation and to pharmaceutical compositions containing 
them. Other N-substituted α-amino carboxamide derivatives 
are known as having pharmacological properties, for 
instance those described by British patent No. 1140748. 
The compounds according to this prior art document are 
useful in the treatment and prophylaxis of such diseases 
as coronary artery disease and atherosclerosis; moreover 
they are useful in the treatment of inflammatory conditions 
such as rheumatoid arthritis. Further substituted amino acid derivatives are known as 
enkephalinase inhibitors, analgesics and hypotensives 
from EP-A-0038758. Still other substituted glycine and alanine derivatives 
are disclosed by US-A-4049663. The compounds according 
to this document have utility as oral analgesics. 
International patent application WO-90/14334 discloses 
N-phenylalkyl substituted α-amino carboxamide derivatives 
active on the central nervous system. It has now been found that new substituted (arylalkylaminobenzyl)aminopropanamide 
derivatives, which are a  
 
selected class of those disclosed in WO-90/14334 by the 
present applicants, have valuable biological properties, 
in particular as anti-epileptic, anti-Parkinson, neuroprotective, 
antidepressant, antispastic, and/or hypnotic 
agents. Accordingly the present invention provides a new compound 
of formula (I) 
 
wherein n is an integer of 1 to 4; 
each of R and R1, which may be the same or different, is 
hydrogen, halogen, trifluoromethyl or C1-C4 alkoxy; 
R2 is hydrogen or C1-C4 alkyl; or a pharmaceutically 
acceptable salt thereof; and wherein when, at the same 
time, R is hydrogen, R1 is hydrogen or halogen and n is 
one, then R2 is other than hydrogen or methyl. A halogen atom is preferably fluorine, chlorine or bromine, 
in particular fluorine or chlorine. A -(CH2)n - group may be a branched or straight alkylene 
chain. A C1-C4 alkoxy group may be a branched or straight group, 
typically methoxy, ethoxy, propoxy, isopropoxy, butoxy 
or tert-butoxy, preferably methoxy or ethoxy. 
A C1-C4 alkyl group may be a branched or straight group, 
typically methyl, ethyl, propyl, isopropyl, butyl or  
 
tert-butyl, preferably methyl or ethyl. Preferred compounds of the invention are the compounds of 
formula (I) wherein, subject to the above proviso, 
n is 1, 2, 3 or 4; R is hydrogen; R1 is hydrogen, halogen, C1-C4 alkoxy
