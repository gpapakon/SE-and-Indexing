<ABSTRACT>
This invention relates to polymer particles that are acid-free in the swellable polymer core and to hollow polymer particles derived therefrom, and to a process for the production of these particles. The acid-free core advantageously decreases the polymer particle's affinity to water. Applicants have discovered that non-carboxylated latexes having a variety of Tg's will swell at temperatures higher than the Tg of the polymer. These latex particles are useful as opacifying plastic pigments for various coatings and particularly as gloss-enhancing plastic pigments for paper and paperboard coatings. Preparation of the hollow polymer particle comprises the use of (meth)acrylate ester monomers, vinyl esters of carboxylic acids or a mixture thereof which are hydrolyzable and swellable at higher temperatures in alkaline environments. The particles may be encapsulated with a hard shell.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to hollow polymer latex particles and a process for the 
production of the particles which are useful as opacifying plastic pigments for various coatings 
and particularly as gloss-enhancing plastic pigments for paper and paperboard coatings. Hollow particles are known to be useful as opacifying agents in coating 
applications such as in paint or paper coating. They also improve paper coating gloss. The use 
of the hollow latex in such coatings reduces the need for expensive pigments, such as TiO2, 
without adding excessive and undesirable weight to the coating. The hollow latex particle 
provides opacity because the hollow structure in a latex particle scatters light more efficiently 
than a corresponding particle of uniform density. The light scattering properties are related to 
the difference in refractive index between the shell and the internal void. Such hollow latexes 
have additional utility in areas other than coatings such as in processes involving 
microencapsulations to prepare, for example, control release agents. U.S. Patent 4,427,836 and U.S. Patent 4,594,363 disclose two different processes 
for making hollow latexes by swelling core-shell polymer particles having acid-containing cores 
with a volatile base or a permanent base. U.S. Patent 4,880,842 describes several disadvantages 
of having high levels of copolymerized acid in the core polymer and discloses a process for 
making hollow latexes by introducing a non-polymeric acid to an early stage of the multi-stage 
polymer particles instead of copolymerizing acid to make swellable cores. These known methods for preparing hollow latexes require cores containing acid 
or acidic monomers to enable swelling to occur at room temperature. The existence of acid in 
the polymer disadvantageously increases the polymer's affinity to water. The sensitivity to the 
effects of water undesirably renders the coating into which the latex is formulated sensitive to 
moisture as well; an undesirable property in coating applications. An acidic core is also 
thought to impart polarity to the polymer and because of such polarity the polymer is thought  
 
to not adsorb surfactants well rendering the polymer unstable or prone to coagulation or 
aggregation in larger particles. The water sensitivity of the core or high affinity for water by 
the core is thought to make it difficult to encapsulate the core with the shell polymer because 
the core tends to remain at the polymer-water interface on the surface of the particle rather 
than
