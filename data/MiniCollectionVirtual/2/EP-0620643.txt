<ABSTRACT>
In a circuit for generating a stop signal for a scanning action in a broadcast receiver, in which a received signal is demodulated and also a signal dependent on the respective field strength is derived, the direct-voltage component of the demodulated signal is formed. A stop signal is generated when the direct-voltage component is below a predetermined value and the field strength is above a predetermined value.

Circuit arrangement for generating a stop signal
for a transmitter search in a broadcast radio receiver,

in which a signal which is dependent on the respective
received field strength is derived, and in which a

received signal is demodulated and the DC voltage component
of the demodulated signal is formed, a stop signal

being generated if the DC voltage component lies below a
predetermined value and the received field strength lies

above a predetermined value, characterized in that the
demodulated signal, which is present in digital form, is

fed to the circuit arrangement at a first sampling rate,
which is reduced to a second sampling rate within the

circuit arrangement, the demodulated signal at the second
sampling rate being used for the purpose of generating

the stop signal.
Circuit arrangement according to Claim 1, characterized
in that the first sampling rate is an integer

multiple of the second sampling rate.
Circuit arrangement according to one of the
preceding claims, characterized in that the demodulated

signal is a stereo multiplex signal.
Circuit arrangement according to one of the
preceding claims, characterized in that the DC voltage

component of the demodulated signal is determined at the
level of the second sampling rate.
Circuit arrangement according to one of the
preceding claims, characterized in that an absolute-value

generator (5) is used to obtain the DC voltage component
of the demodulated signal. 
Circuit arrangement according to one of the
preceding claims, characterized in that a low-pass

filter (2) is provided upstream of the sampling rate
reduction (3), which filter is designed as an FIR filter,

in which a number of signals, which are each delayed with
respect to one another by a sampling period in accordance

with the first sampling rate, are added, in a manner
weighted with coefficients (K), and the number of signals

is equal to the ratio of the first sampling rate to the
second sampling rate.
Circuit arrangement according to one of the
preceding claims, characterized in that the first sampling

rate is 228 kHz, in that the second sampling rate is
equal to 9.5 kHz, and in that, given 23 delay elements,

the number of signals is 24.
Circuit arrangement according to one of the
preceding claims, characterized in that the field

strength signal is filtered by means of a low-pass
filter (10) upstream of the threshold value

decision (11).
