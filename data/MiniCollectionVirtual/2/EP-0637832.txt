<ABSTRACT>
An electron beam device comprises a cold cathode 1, modulation means 2 and an 
anode 3. The components of the device have a longitudinal configuration and enable an 

electron beam produced by the cathode 1 to be transversely modulated with a microwave 
signal transmitted along the modulator waveguide structure 2. The modulated output may be 

propagated along the elongate anode 3 or may be arranged to propagate through the anode 
substrate 5 and interface directly with an antenna or other circuit element.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to electronic devices employing cold cathodes, and 
particularly, but not exclusively, to cathodes of the field emission type. Most electronic devices operate as the result of longitudinal modulation of the electric 
current in the direction of the current. This is particularly true of solid state devices but it is 
also true of many classes of vacuum electronic devices. In these, the modulation of the 
velocity in the direction of the current produces little immediate modulation of the current 
unless the electrons of the beam are of very low velocity. For such low velocity beams 
modulation results in some electrons being returned to the cathode. For higher velocity beam 
devices the resulting velocity modulation is converted to current modulation only if the beam 
is permitted to traverse a sufficiently long path. Both of these features are undesirable. In 
the former case, with a field emission cold cathode in particular, the returned electrons will 
be collected by extraction grids biased at about 100V and will result in significant energy 
dissipation. In the latter case, the long drift tube path length results in ungainly device 
geometries which are difficult to manufacture. In contrast, transverse modulation does not suffer from either of the above drawbacks. 
Firstly, the net forward velocity of the electron beam is not reduced by the 
modulation and there is thus no increased likelihood of electrons being captured by the 
extraction grid of a cold cathode. Secondly, the conversion of velocity modulation to  
 
current modulation is not directly related to the path length of the beam but rather to its 
width. The longitudinal velocity of the beam is thus not a critical parameter and the size and 
scale of the device is governed mainly by the degree of control of the beam profile. Indeed 
higher beam velocities would be an advantage rather than a disadvantage, resulting in lower 
charge densities, reduced space charge repulsion, more easily controlled beams and higher 
output power. A number of vacuum electronic devices do exploit transverse modulation, notably 
magnetrons and cathode ray tubes (CRTs). Both of these are characterised by high efficiency 
and relatively compact geometry. These transverse modulated devices do, however, have limitations. In the case of the 
magnetron a magnetic field is required to control the beam close to the cathode. The 
magnetic field is essentially fixed and as a result output power and frequency are not widely 
tunable within a single
