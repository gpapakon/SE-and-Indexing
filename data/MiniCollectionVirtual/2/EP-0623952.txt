<ABSTRACT>
A cooling member (10) for semiconductor elements or similar components, especially ones made of extruded light metal, having cooling fins (20) of approximately bar-shaped cross-section extending upwards, apart and approximately parallel to each other, from a baseplate (12), the baseplate having retention grooves (16) on one surface (14), in which grooves one cooling fin is in each case fixed to a support section. A plurality of through holes (26) is in each case formed in the cooling fins and the surface area of the through hole running between two bars is a little smaller than the flow cross-section between two neighbouring cooling fins, provided by the slight fin separation.
