<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a semiconductor device,
and in particular, provides a high performance semiconductor
integrated circuit which is capable of comparing the magnitudes
of a plurality of inputted data at a high speed using hardware.In the fields of data processing or automatic control, the
comparison of data expressed as numerical values and the
classification of the magnitudes thereof is extremely important.These include, for example, the determination of the larger
of two numbers, the selection, from a plurality of input data,
of data having the maximum value, or the arrangement by size and
numerical value of a plurality of data, that is to say, sorting,
etc.Such separations can be conducted using a standard
calculator; however, in order to conduct a large number of
calculations, a large period of time is required, and this is
thus very difficult to use in real-time control. In particular,
in the case of use in the control of robots or the like,
installation in the robots is required, so that realization in
terms of a small LSI chip has been desired.Using a microprocessor, when the programming thereof was
attempted, an enormous amount of time was required, so that the
application thereof was essentially impossible. Research and 
development has been conducted in order to produce a circuit
which conducts direct magnitude comparison by means of hardware;
however, a great number of elements are required for the
realization of such a circuit and because calculations are
carried out via a number of stages of circuits, large-scale
integration which is small in size and is capable of high speed
calculation has not yet been realized.The present invention has as an object thereof to provide a
semiconductor device which is capable of carrying out
calculations for comparing the magnitude of a plurality of data
at high speed using simple circuitry.A CMOS inverter having nMOS and pMOS transistors with a common floating gate
(neuron MOS transistors) are described in JP-A-300 6679.
A "winner-take-all" circuit employing feedback is described in Electronics
Letters, vol. 27, No. 11, 23rd. May 1991, pp. 957 - 958.The semiconductor device in accordance with the present
invention is defined in claim 1. Further embodiment are defined in the dependent claims.Fig. 1(a) is a circuit diagram showing a first example useful for understanding
the present invention; Fig. 1(b) is a modified example using a
CMOS switch; and Fig. 1(c) is a modified example using a three-bit
digital signal in place of the analog signal
