<ABSTRACT>
Method for controlling a fuel pump (5) equipping the fuel circuit (10) of a motor vehicle internal combustion engine (1), the fuel pump (5) being of the electrically-driven type and being controlled by the engine management system (3), consisting in actuating the fuel pump (5) in an anticipated (early) fashion when the electronic engine management system (3) is switched on for a predetermined timed period, characterised in that the duration of the time period is adjusted as a function of predetermined criteria.

<CLAIMS>
A process for controlling a fuel pump (5) equipping the fuel
circuit (10) of a motor vehicle internal combustion engine (1), the fuel

pump (5) being of the electric drive type and being pilot-controlled by
the engine management system (3), comprising actuating the fuel pump (5)

in anticipatory manner when voltage is applied to the electronic engine
management system (3) for a predetermined time delay period (T),

characterised in that the duration of the time delay period is adjusted in
dependence on predetermined criteria (PAPF).
A process for controlling a fuel pump (5) according to claim 1
characterised in that said time delay period (T) is adjusted in accordance

with predetermined operating criteria of the engine (1).
A process for controlling a fuel pump (5) according to claim 2
characterised in that said time delay period (T) is adjusted only subject

to an enablement protocol (PAPF) triggered by an operator.
A process for controlling a fuel pump (5) according to claim 2
characterised in that said time delay period (T) is adjusted in dependence

on the pressure of the fuel obtaining in the fuel circuit.
A process for controlling a fuel pump (5) according to any one
of claims 1 to 3 characterised in that the time delay period (T) can

assume two values, a first value (Tc) used normally each time voltage is
applied to the electronic engine management system (3) and a second value

(Tl) which is used only under predetermined circumstances, the first time
delay period (Tc) being substantially shorter than the second time delay

period (Tl).
A process for controlling a fuel pump (5) according to claim 5
characterised in that the second time delay period (Tl) is more

particularly intended to be used when the fuel line (10) is empty. 
A process for controlling a fuel pump (5) according to claim 6
characterised in that the second time delay period (Tl) is more

particularly intended to be used before the engine (1) is started for the
first time.
A process for controlling a fuel pump (5) according to claim 7
characterised in that said second time delay period (Tl) is used after the

engine management system (3) has detected the despatch by an operator of a
predetermined signal (PAPF) and provided that the engine (1) has never

operated previously.
A process for controlling a fuel pump (5) according to claim 8
characterised in that said predetermined signal is defined by the foot

hard-down position of the accelerator pedal.
A process for controlling a fuel pump (5) according to either
one of claims 8 and 9 characterised in that the engine is considered as

having operated when it has reached a predetermined speed of rotation.
