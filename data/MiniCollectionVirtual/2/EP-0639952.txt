<ABSTRACT>
A process and device are disclosed for verifying the authenticity and/or identifying the spatial structure of an object to be inspected. A layer or surface (6) which is transparent to ultrasonic waves but which reflects or diffracts electromagnetic waves is arranged in the body (4). This layer or surface (6) in the body (5) is locally and time-dependently deformed by the ultrasonic waves according to the form and intensity of the reflected or diffracted ultrasonic waves, and this layer (6) is irradiated at an angle with electromagnetic waves. In the area of the reflected and/or diffracted electromagnetic radiation located under the reflection angle (9) said radiation is sensed and its modification caused by its reflection or diffraction on the layer (6) is evaluated. In order to implement this process, a device is designed so that said layer (6) is arranged in the body (4) and that the device (1) has a source (7) of electromagnetic radiation whose rays are directed towards the layer (6), and at least one radiation receiver (8) is pprovided in the area of the reflected or diffracted electromagnetic radiation in order to evaluate this radiation.

A method for determining the authenticity and/or for identifying the respective 
spatial structure of an object (2) to be inspected, particularly the epithelial structure 

of the skin e.g. of a human finger, whereby said object (2) to be inspected is placed 
on a plane or curved surface (5) and is exposed to ultrasonic waves traversing a 

body (4) contiguous with said surface (5) and the ultrasonic waves reflected and/or 
backscattered at the object (2) reproduce a different structure in each case of 

different objects (2) and are evaluated, characterized in that provided in the body 
(4) is a layer or surface (6) which is transparent to the ultrasonic waves and reflects 

and/or diffracts electromagnetic waves, that said layer or surface (6) in the body (4) 
is deformed in a locally different and time-dependent way by the ultrasonic waves 

according to the form and intensity of the backscattered or diffracted ultrasonic 
waves, and that said layer (6) is exposed to radiation of electromagnetic waves at 

an angle, and in the area of the electromagnetic beams reflected and/or diffracted at 
the angle of emergence (9) the same are intercepted and their change caused by 

their reflection or diffraction at the layer (6) is evaluated.
