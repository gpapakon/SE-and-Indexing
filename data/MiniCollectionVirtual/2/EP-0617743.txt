<ABSTRACT>
The dirt-repellent monofilament with a toughness of at least 36 cN/tex and an extension of under 44 % has a soiling index AI
>
2 after five soiling and cleaning cycles. To manufacture the dirt-repellent monofilaments, a copolymer with a melting point of 255 to 275  C and consisting of alkenes and perfluoroalkenes is added to a polymer melt of polyethylene terephthalate before extrusion. The dirt-repellent monofilament is advantageously used in the manufacture of cleaning filters for the dry section of a paper machine, i.e. paper machine fabric filters. It may also be used to produce fabrics for general use as technical fabrics which have to be cleaned in difficult conditions.

Soil-repellent monofilament for paper machine
wire-cloths, having a diameter from 0.2 to 0.7 mm,

consisting of a polyester comprising at least 85% by
weight of polyethylene terephthalate and having a

viscosity index (V.I.) of at least 96 dl/g and a
copolymer, characterized in that the monofilament contains

from 1.5 to 5% by weight of a polynary copolymer
prepared from alkenes and perfluoroalkenes and has a

homogeneous composition over the entire cross-section.
Monofilament according to claim 1, characterized
in that the copolymer consists of ethene and tetrafluoroethene.
Monofilament according to claim 1, characterized
in that the copolymer has a melting point from 255°C to

275°C.
Monofilaments according to claims 1 to 3, characterized
by a tenacity of at least 36 cN/tex, an elongation

of 
<
 44%, based on the unextended filament, and at
the same time a soiling index 
<
 2 after 5 soiling/washing
cycles.
Process for producing a soil-repellent monofilament
from 0.2 to 0.7 mm in diameter for paper machine

wire-cloths from a polymer melt consisting of a mixture
of a polyester comprising at least 85% by weight of

polyethylene terephthalate and having a viscosity index
(V.I.) of at least 96 dl/g and a copolymer, characterized

in that the polymer melt of polyethylene terephthalate
has mixed into it, prior to the extruding, from 1.5 to 5%

by weight of a copolymer prepared from alkenes and
perfluoroalkenes and the monofilament has a homogeneous 

composition over the entire cross-section.
Use of the soil-repellent monofilaments having a
diameter from 0.2 to 0.7 mm, comprising a polyblend

comprising a polyester comprising at least 85% by weight
of polyethylene terephthalate and having a viscosity

index (V.I.) of at least 96 dl/g and from 1.5 to 5% by
weight of a polynary copolymer of alkenes and

perfluoroalkenes and having a homogeneous composition
over the entire cross-section, for producing wire-cloths

for of paper machines.
