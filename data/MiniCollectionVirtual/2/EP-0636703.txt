Method for depositing a layer on a substrate
wafer using a sputtering process,


in which the substrate wafer (3) is arranged in a
sputtering reactor (1) with a target (2) and a collimator

(4) in such a way that the collimator (4) is
arranged between the substrate wafer (3) and the target

(2),
in which a vertical and a lateral component occurs in
the particle flux during the sputtering, the vertical

component being inhomogeneous over the substrate wafer
(3),
in which the collimator (4) is provided with cylindrical
holes (5) whose cylinder axis is aligned essentially

perpendicular to the surface of the substrate
wafer (3) and which transmit essentially only the

vertical component of the particle flux,
in which the collimator (4) has holes (5) with different
values of hole radius,
in which the hole radii in regions of the sputtering
reactor (1) with higher vertical flux components are

smaller than in regions of the sputtering reactor (1)
with smaller vertical flux components.
Method according to Claim 1,

in which the substrate wafer (3) is positioned in the
reactor (1) in such a way that the centre of the

reactor and the centre of the wafer coincide,
in which the hole radii decrease constantly from the
centre of the sputtering reactor (1) to the point of

maximum sputtering rate on the target (2), and increase 
again from this point to a distance from the centre

corresponding to the edge of the wafer, and are constant
outside the edge of the wafer.
Method according to Claim 2, in which the hole
radii r(x) have the following distribution as a function

of the distance x from the centre of the sputtering
reactor:


r(x) =

Method according to Claim 3, in which x
m
, a

 and
a

 are determined by taking measurements of the erosion
profile of a target after it has been used for a relatively

long time.
Method according to Claim 3 or 4,

in which x

, with b less than/equal to 0.9,
in which a
0
 is between 0.1 and 0.7,
in which a
1
 is between 0.1 and 0.7.
Method according to one of Claims 3 to 5, in
which the minimum hole radius is chosen in such a way

that the aspect ratio (2r
m
)/d of the collimator is essentially
equal to the aspect ratio of those structures in

the surface of the substrate wafer which have the
smallest diameter, d being the thickness of the

collimator.
Method according to one of Claims 1 to 6, in
which the sputtering rate in the sputtering reactor is

modified by applying a magnetic field in such a way that
the lateral flux density is set homogeneously.
Method according to one of Claims 1 to 7, in
which the distance between adjacent holes on the collimator

takes different values.
Method according to one of Claims 1 to 8,

in which a shade (9), which protrudes from the collimator
(6) in a plane perpendicular to the cylinder axis

of the holes (7), is provided between each pair of
adjacent holes (7) on the collimator (6),
in which the holes (7) of the collimator (6) are each

annularly enclosed by shades (9),
in which the collimator (6) is arranged in such a way
that the shades (9) point towards the target, so that

part of the lateral flux component is intercepted by
the shades (9).
