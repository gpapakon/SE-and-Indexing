<ABSTRACT>
A foamable organic composition comprising a compound 
foamable to 50% or more comprising an organic polymer and a 

chemical foaming agent, and, as a physical foaming agent, at 
least one member selected from the group consisting of rare 

gases and carbon dioxide; and a method for producing a foamed 
article having a high expansion ratio by using said 

composition. According to the present invention, a foamed 
article having a uniform and fine foam structure and a high 

expansion ratio of not less than 75% (which is as high as when 
freon gas is used) can be obtained without causing 

environmental problems such as depletion of the ozon layer. 
When applied, in particular, to a foamed layer for an insulated 

conductor, such as foam-insulated electric wire which is 
required to have high performance insulation and is occasionally 

installed under severe conditions, the composition of the 
present invention advantageously provides an insulated 

conductor with no potential buckling.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a foamable organic polymer 
composition capable of forming a uniform and fine foam having a 
high expansion ratio of, for example, not less than 75%, which 
is suited for use as an insulating layer of coaxial cables, and 
to the production of a foamed article using said composition. Traditionally, various fluorocarbon gases (freon) have been 
used as foaming agents to obtain foamed articles having high 
expansion ratios. The use of freon is, however, gradually 
restricted in view of its harmful influence to the environment, 
such as depletion of the ozon layer. While there have been studied various foaming agents to 
take the place of freon, they are associated with difficulties 
in obtaining an article foamed in a uniform fashion and having a 
high expansion ratio. Accordingly, a method for producing, 
without using freon, a uniformly and finely-foamed article 
having a high expansion ratio, which causes no environmental 
problems such as depletion of the ozon layer, or a foamable 
composition capable of providing such foamed article is 
demanded. The present invention relates to a foamable organic polymer  
 
composition comprising a compound (A) foamable to 50% or more 
comprising an organic polymer (A-1) and a chemical foaming 
agent (A-2), and, as a physical foaming agent, at least one 
member (B) selected from the group consisting of rare gases and 
carbon dioxide; and to a method for producing a foamed article 
having a high expansion ratio by using said composition. Fig. 1 shows one embodiment of the extrusion foaming of the 
present invention. Fig. 2 shows a discharge end of a die and a sizing die of 
Fig. 1. Fig. 3 shows a sizing die and a cooling device of Fig. 1. The physical foaming agent (B) to be used in the present 
invention is at least one member selected from the group 
consisting of rare gases of helium, neon, argon, cripton, xenon 
and radon, and carbon dioxide. Specifically, argon gas is 
desirable in that foams having higher expansion ratios and 
higher levels of uniformity can be obtained, that it does not 
destroy the ozon layer as do freons, that it is extremely 
stable and does not react chemically, and that it is free of 
explosion. As used herein, the expansion ratio was measured by 
specific gravity method and is defined by the following 
formula: 
wherein ρ₀ is the density of a polymer before foaming and ρ 
is the density of the obtained foam. When a mixed gas of a rare gas and carbon dioxide is used 
as a (B) component, the ratio (volume
