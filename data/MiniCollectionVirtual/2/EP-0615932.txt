<ABSTRACT>
In the case of a transfer apparatus for books, blocks, brochures, layer stacks, block stacks or the like into a new orientation, preferably arranged in front of a stacker, having a rotating device which clamps the products (A) and is intended for selective rotation through 180@, use is made, with regard to functionally reliable rotation of the products (A) in a very confined space, of a clamping conveyor (1) which non-positively takes over the products (A) from a supply conveyor (3, 18) and is rotatable about a vertical axis (2) through 180@, and the conveying movement of which can be braked to a standstill and is coordinated with the rotational movement in such a way that, when the braking is discontinued, the centre of gravity of the product (A) lies above the axis of rotation in the 90@-position of the clamping conveyor (1). The conveyor movement of the clamping conveyor (1) is reversible after the standstill, and the clamping conveyor (1) can be further rotated into the 180@-position. Lastly, means (20) for controlling the conveying and rotational movement of the clamping conveyor (1) are provided.

<CLAIMS>
A conveying apparatus for transferring books, blocks, 
brochures, stacks of sections, stacks of blocks or similar 

products to a new, rotated position, preferably located in 
front of a stacker, said conveying apparatus having a 

rotation device which clamps the products in order to 
effect selective rotation through 180째, wherein a gripping 

conveyor (1) is provided, which acquires the products (A) 
from a feeding conveyor (3, 18) by means of frictional 

adhesion, and which can be rotated through 180째 about a 
vertical shaft (2), it being possible to slow the conveying 

movement of said gripping conveyor (1) to a standstill, and 
said conveying movement being harmonized with the rotation 

in a manner such that when the slowing-down ends, the 
centre of gravity of the product (A) is above the rotation 

axis, with the gripping conveyor (1) in the 90째 position, 
wherein the conveying movement of the gripping conveyor (1) 

can be reversed after the standstill, and said gripping 
conveyor (1) can be rotated further, to the 180째 position, 

and wherein means (20) of controlling the conveying 
movement and rotation of said gripping conveyor (1) are 

provided. 
The conveying apparatus as claimed in claim 1, 
wherein the gripping conveyor (1) and the feeding 

conveyor (3, 18) can be driven at the same conveying 
speed.  

 
The conveying apparatus as claimed in claim 1 or 2, 
wherein the gripping conveyor (1) comprises a lower 

transport belt (7) which can be driven so as to 
circulate endlessly, and further comprises an upper 

array of freely rotatable rollers (10), mounted in 
a structural component (14) which is freely slidable 

in the upward direction. 
The conveying apparatus as claimed in claim 3, 
wherein the transport belt (7) and the structural 

component (14) carrying the rollers (10) are mounted 
on a common supporting frame (13) which can be 

rotated about a shaft (2). 
The conveying apparatus as claimed in claim 3 or 4, 
wherein the vertical movement of the structural 

component (14) with the rollers (10) can be limited 
in the downward direction, according to the height 

of the current product (A), this movement limitation 
being effected by positioning means (15-17). 
The conveying apparatus as claimed in any one of 
claims 1 to 5, wherein a belt conveyor (3) is located 

upline of the gripping conveyor (1) and is provided 
with an upper pressure roller (18) which can be 

drive-rotated and raised or lowered through the 
agency of control means (20). 
The conveying apparatus as claimed in any one of 
claims 3 to 6, wherein the lower transport belt 

of the gripping conveyor (1) is configured as 
a toothed belt (7), its carrying side running 

between semicircular lateral supporting plates 
(8, 9).
