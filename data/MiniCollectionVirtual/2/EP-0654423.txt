<ABSTRACT>
Two-level pallet-holder container (1) of the type that 
is used to transport merchandize, having all of the surfaces 

thereof closed, and with some standard measurements 
in order to be transported by sea, railroad or highway, 

having a false intermediate bottom (6), formed by two pairs 
of brackets (13,14) with their corresponding guides (7,8), that define 

two top compartments (11,12) in such a way that one of the pairs 
of brackets (13) is integral with the side walls of the container (1), 

and the second pair of brackets (14) remains supported 
by a plate (5) positioned in relation to the bottom (4) of the 

container (1) in a center longitudinal position that defines 
the two bottom compartments (9,10) with their corresponding guides (2,3).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a two-level
pallet-holder container
for transporting merchandize,
the container being
of the type that, having standard measurements,
can be transported by sea, rail or highway,
and all of the surfaces thereof are closed.In numerous conventional containers used to transport
merchandize, no compartment is defined therefore the
entire surface thereof remains smooth along the entire
height in order to allow insertion and stacking of the
goods to be transported.Hence, certain containers have on their bottom two
pairs of guides on which the respective shoes are located
on which the pallet is placed with the goods stacked on
it, in order to subsequently push it with the minimum 
effort towards the inside, the pallets remaining abutted
to each other, taking up the entire space thereof.Upon transporting certain goods, or materials, there
is the possibility of stacking several pallets, taking
up the entire height of the container with the corresponding
goods or materials, without them being damaged at all.On the contrary, in transporting certain goods, there
is no possibility to stack them according to the entire
height of the container.In this case the container has 50% of its capacity
taken up, whereby transportation becomes considerably
more expensive, since for a certain amount of goods to
be transported twice as many trips have to be made than
if the container were 100% full.On the other hand, in those containers that have an
intermediate bottom, this takes up the entire surface
of the same and it is loaded at the two free side surfaces
thereof, which will remain closed by the respective
sheets.GB-A-2 223 742 discloses a container according to the preamble
of claim 1 of the present application The present invention as claimed consists in
a two-level pallet-holder container of the type that is
used to transport merchandise, with all the surfaces
thereof closed and with an intermediate bottom, and that,
having some standard measurements, can be transported by
sea, railroad or highway. The invention is characterized in
that the container has a false intermediate bottom,
formed by two pairs of brackets and, each bracket
having a guide for pallet shoes, said brackets
defining two top compartments and, a first pair
of the brackets being integral to the side walls of
the container and a second pair of the brackets being
supported by a vertical plate positioned on the bottom
of the container in a center longitudinal position,
said vertical plate defining two bottom compartments
and,
