<ABSTRACT>
Vinyl chloride polymer is prepared by 
suspension polymerization of monomeric vinyl 

chloride or a mixture of vinyl chloride and 
another monomer in an aqueous medium while 

agitating the suspension. A first partially 
saponified polyvinyl alcohol having a degree of 

saponification of 60 - 80 mol% and an average 
degree of polymerization of 500-1,000 is added 

as a suspension stabilizer at the start of 
polymerization, and a second partially 

saponified polyvinyl alcohol having a degree of 
saponification of 75 - 85 mol% and an average 

degree of polymerization of 1,500-2,700 is 
added while the conversion is 30% to 60%. The 

agitating power is controlled to 80 - 120 
kg·m/s·ton from the start of polymerization to a 

conversion of 20 to 50%, and to 130-200 
kg·m/s·ton from then to the completion of 

polymerization. The resulting vinyl chloride 
polymer is of quality as demonstrated by a high 

bulk density and improved free flow, monomer 
removal, gelation, and plasticizer absorption as 

well as minimal fish eye. Scale build-up on 
the reactor wall is minimized.

<DESCRIPTION>
This specification relates to processes for preparing 
vinyl chloride polymers. Vinyl chloride polymers are useful resins 
having excellent physical properties and find 
widespread application whether they are rigid or 
flexible. Vinyl chloride polymers are generally 
shaped by calendering, extrusion molding and 
injection molding techniques. In an advanced 
rigid extrusion molding technique, it is desired 
to increase the throughput of a molding machine. 
It is then desired to have a vinyl chloride 
polymer having a high bulk density. In preparing vinyl chloride polymers by 
suspension polymerization in aqueous media, many 
attempts were made to produce vinyl chloride 
polymers having a higher bulk density, for  
 
example, by feeding an addition monomer during 
polymerization as disclosed in Japanese Patent 
Application Kokai (JP-A) No. 16800/1984, using 
highly saponified polyvinyl alcohol as disclosed 
in JP-A 7600/1982, and feeding an additional 
suspending agent during polymerization as 
disclosed in JP-A 39309/1993 or USSN 922,187. Although these processes are successful in 
producing polymers having a high bulk density, 
the polymers are less porous, so that 
moulded parts have many "fish eye" defects 
and gelation is difficult. The low porosity 
also hinders monomer removal, which means that 
the polymer grains have a high concentration of 
residual unreacted monomer, with bad effect on 
the working environment associated with polymer 
preparation or molding and working processes. 
There is a possibility that the unreacted 
monomer be left in molded parts, and the 
presence of residual monomer is detrimental in a 
particular application associated with food. On the other hand, improvements were made 
in polyvinyl alcohol as the suspending agent. 
There were developed oil-soluble polyvinyl  
 
alcohols having a low degree of polymerization 
and a low degree of saponification and modified 
polyvinyl alcohols having various modifying 
groups introduced therein. Among them, the 
oil-soluble polyvinyl alcohols are effective 
for improving monomer removal and fish eye 
control, but result in a lowering of bulk 
density and deteriorated free flow due to 
electrostatic charging. The modified polyvinyl 
alcohols fail to keep suspension systems stable 
with conventional techniques, leaving the 
problems of scale build-up and substantial 
particle size variation. JP-A 311708/1992 or USSN 08/060,596 
proposes a dispersion polymerization method by 
which a vinyl chloride polymer having
