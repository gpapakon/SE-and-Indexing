<ABSTRACT>
A shoe comprising preformed upper (3) and sole 
members joined by stitching and a method of making the 

same, in which a narrow periphery member (7) is disposed 
between the upper and sole members and along the outer 

periphery of the sole member (1), and the periphery member 
is adhered to the sole member with adhesive agent after 

the upper member is first stitched to the periphery 
member. The periphery member has an L-shaped cross-section 

and includes a flat and narrow horizontal 
adhesive margin portion (9) conforming to the periphery of 

the sole member and a side wall portion (10) extending 
vertically therefrom, and it is stitched to the upper 

member in the side wall portion and adhered to the sole 
member in the adhesive margin portion. It is very easy 

to use a sewing machine for stitching the periphery 
member to the upper member since the periphery member 

surrounds a large opening therein.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a shoe, especially, 
of such a kind as to be made by joining preformed upper 
and sole members and a method of making the same. Such a shoe is generally made by bending the 
lower edge of an upper member, made of natural or 
artificial leather or synthetic resin and formed through 
such steps as sewing, adhering and heat-pressing, and 
joining it to a preformed sole member, made of natural 
or artificial leather or synthetic resin or rubber, by 
stitching or adhering, or by stitching a similar upper 
member to a separately prepared insole member and, 
thereafter, adhering the insole member to the sole 
member. In a simplified method as disclosed in U.S. 
patent No. 4,505,055 as shown in Figure 1, a sole member 
1 is provided with a peripheral wall 2 and the lower 
edge of an upper member 3 is stitched thereto with a 
thread 4. Thereafter, an insole 5 is laid therein to 
complete a shoe. In order to stitch the upper member in a shoe 
according to the prior art mentioned above, it is 
necessary to insert the upper or lower jaw of a sewing 
machine into the shoe through an opening 6 formed in its 
upper member 3. However, it is difficult for a usual 
shoe sewing machine to gain access to every working 
position, so that the stitching work may be disabled or 
the working efficiency may be remarkably reduced, unless 
the opening 6 extends to the vicinity of the toe as in 
the case of basket ball shoes. In the prior art shoes, 
therefore, their design is restricted by the sewing 
machine to be used and, for free design, it is necessary 
to use a sewing machine designed especially and 
exclusively for each design. This has been a bar to  
 
cost reduction of shoes. Accordingly, an object of this invention is to 
provide an improved structure of shoes and a method of 
realizing it, which enables stitching work of the upper 
member to be effected more easily and efficiently with a 
usual shoe sewing machine regardless of the design of 
shoes, especially, of their upper members. The shoe according to this invention, which 
can achieve the above-mentioned objective, comprises 
preformed upper and sole members and a periphery member 
disposed between the upper and sole members. The 
periphery member has an L-shaped cross-section composed 
of a flat and narrow horizontal adhesive margin portion 
conforming to the periphery of the sole member and a 
side wall portion standing erect therefrom and is 
stitched to the upper member with a thread in the side 
wall portion and adhered to the sole

<CLAIMS>
A shoe comprising an upper member and a sole 
member, characterised in that a periphery member is 

disposed between said upper and sole members and has a 
horizontal adhesive margin portion conforming to the 

outer periphery of said sole member, and a side wall 
portion extending upwardly from said adhesive margin 

portion, said side wall portion of said periphery member 
being stitched to the lower edge of said upper member 

and said adhesive margin portion of said periphery 
member being adhered to said sole member.

that said periphery member is made of synthetic resin. 
A shoe as claimed in claim 1 or claim 2, 
characterised in that said periphery member has an L-shaped 

cross-section. 
A method making a shoe by joining preformed 
upper and sole members, characterised by the steps of
