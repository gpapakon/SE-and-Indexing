<ABSTRACT>
The present invention provides a sterilization system that includes a low
frequency power feedback control system for controllably adjusting a power applied to

a low frequency plasma within a vacuum chamber of the sterilization system to remove
gas or vapor species from the article. The power has a frequency of from 0 to

approximately 200 kHz. The low frequency power feedback control system includes a
power monitor adapted to produce a first signal indicative of the power applied to the

low frequency plasma within the vacuum chamber. The low frequency power feedback
control system further includes a power control module adapted to produce a second

signal in response to the first signal from the power monitor, and a power controller
adapted to adjust, in response to the second signal, the power applied to the low

frequency plasma to maintain a substantially stable average power applied to the low
frequency plasma while the article is being processed.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to systems and methods for controlling gas discharge
plasmas in sterilization systems that employ gas discharge plasmas.Plasmas produced using radio frequency (RF) generators in particular have
proven to be valuable tools in processes for the sterilization of medical devices. For
example, in U.S. Patent Nos. 4,643,876 and 4,756,882, which are incorporated by
reference herein, Jacobs, et al. disclose using hydrogen peroxide as a precursor in a low
temperature sterilization system that employs RF plasma. The combination of hydrogen
peroxide vapor and a RF plasma provides an efficient method of sterilizing medical
devices without using or leaving highly toxic materials or forming toxic by-products.
Similarly, Jacob, U.S. Patent No. 5,302,343, and Griffiths, et al., U.S. Patent No.
5,512,244, teach the use of RF plasmas in a sterilization process.However, there are problems associated with the use of an RF plasma in a
sterilization process. The RF plasma may leave residual hydrogen peroxide on the
sterilized article. The residual amount of hydrogen peroxide remaining on the sterilized
article depends upon the RF power applied to the article, the amount of time exposed to
the RF plasma, and the material of the article. For example, while some plastics (e.g.,
polyurethane) absorb hydrogen peroxide, other materials (e.g., Teflon) absorb relatively
little, thereby yielding less residual hydrogen peroxide after sterilization.In addition, inherent inefficiencies in the energy conversion from the low
frequency (e.g., 60 Hz) line voltage to the RF (e.g., approximately 1 MHz - 1 GHz)
voltage used to generate the RF plasma limit the power efficiency of such systems to
typically less than 50%. Energy efficiency is further reduced by typically 5 - 20% by
virtue of the losses from the required impedance matching network between the RF 
generator and the load. Such low energy efficiency significantly increases the cost per
watt applied to the sterilized articles. The required instrumentation for using RF
electrical energy (e.g., RF generator, impedance matching network, monitoring
circuitry) is expensive, which also increases the cost per watt applied to the sterilized
articles.One aspect of the present invention is a sterilization system that comprises a low
frequency power feedback control system for controllably adjusting a power applied to
a low frequency plasma within a vacuum chamber of the sterilization system to remove
gas or vapor species from the article. The power has a frequency of from
