<ABSTRACT>
An optical connector is provided which requires less accurate machining during manufacture, can reduce the number and/or complexity of component parts required and can achieve a standard industrial product which nevertheless maintains very stable connections. In a receptacle (2) for the optical connector, an alignment sleeve (13) aligns and optically connects an optical fibre unit (18) to another optical fibre unit or to an input/output window of other optical elements in a housing (16). The housing (3) of the receptacle (2) holds the sleeve (13) in an alignment and is comprised of a plurality of housing halves (3a and 3b, 31 and 31b) joined along a major plane extending through the axis of the sleeve (13). The housing halves may include mating surfaces, projections or indents offset from said major plane.

<DESCRIPTION>
 Optical ConnectorsThe present invention relates to optical connectors. It relates in particular though not exclusively to receptacles for optical connectors. Optical connectors may serve for optically connecting an optical fibre unit to another fibre unit or an optical fibre unit to other optical elements. The invention has an important application in optical fibre communications apparatus.Optical connectors which make a mating connection are known for communications and for short-distance data links. Such connectors are suitable for optical cable transmission systems (simply called "FC connectors") and for optical subscriber systems (simply called "SC connector").Conventional optical connectors, such as for example SC connectors, comprise a plug and an associated socket or receptacle (which is also sometimes referred to as an 'adapter').The basic arrangement of these components is as follows: The plug comprises a ferrule with an optical fibre unit at its centre. The fibre is concentrically surrounded by sleeve and by a cylindrical jacket, in that order, made from ceramics, metal or polymer. The ferrule is held in a frame, and a positioning key is disposed on the periphery of the frame. A compression spring pushes the ferrule towards its forward end, and the frame itself is fixed to an inner wall surface of a plug housing.Typically, a conventional receptacle comprises a resin housing which is injection-molded as a single unit. The housing has a cylindrical alignment sleeve extending within the housing in an axial direction. When the plug described above is fitted into the receptacle, the ferrule of the plug becomes aligned with the alignment sleeve. In this manner the end face of the optical fibre unit can be optically connected to and aligned with another optical fibre unit or to other optical elements on the same axis.Generally, in an optical connector for data links the optical fibre unit is often connected directly to a light emitting device or a light receiving device. In the case of such an opto-electronic transducer module (or "active component"), the housing usually contains optical elements, such as light emitting and/or light receiving devices, and electric circuits, 

which together perform the conversion between optical and electric signals. The module is incorporated into the receptacle and the receptacle is connected to the plug so that the optical fibre unit is connected to the optical devices to enable the transmission and/or reception of data.

Claims
1. A receptacle for an optical connector which includes an alignment sleeve receiving an optical fibre unit and end face of optical elements to optically connect the optical fibre unit to another optical fibre unit or the end face of an optical fibre unit to a light input/output window of the optical elements, the receptacle comprising a housing holding the alignment sleeve in an aligned relation and comprised of a plurality of housing halve divided with the alignment held on a centre axis of the housing. 2. A receptacle for an optical connector which includes an alignment sleeve capable of receiving an optical fibre unit having an endface by which optically to connect the optical fibre unit to another optical fibre unit or to a light input and/or output window of an optical component comprising one or more optical elements, the receptacle including a housing which comprises a plurality of sections each divided into half- sections such that each half-section holds the alignment sleeve on the axis of the housing.
3. A receptacle for an optical connector which includes an alignment sleeve capable of receiving an optical fibre unit having an endface by which optically to connect the optical fibre unit to another optical fibre unit or to a light input and/or output window of an optical component comprising one or more optical elements, the receptacle including a housing which comprises a plurality of sections each divided into half- sections such that the axis of the alignment sleeve lies in the dividing planes of the housing sections.
4. The receptacle according to any preceding claim, wherein the housing holds an active component in an aligned relation with the alignment sleeve incorporated therein and, upon the assembling of the housing halves into the housing, the housing holds the active component between opposing sides of the housing halves.
5. The receptacle according to any preceding claim, wherein a flange is formed on a housing section of the active component and recesses are provided as a one-end face side of the mating housing halves to hold the flange in place, upon the assembling of the housing halves into the housing, so that the housing section of the active component is held between the opposing sides of the housing halves. 


6. The receptacle according to any preceding claim, wherein one of the housing halves has a projection at its mating side surface and the other housing half has a corresponding hole at its mating side surface so that, upon the assembling of the housing halves into the housing, the projection of said one housing half is fitted into the hole of said other housing half to achieve a positional alignment.
7. The receptacle according to any preceding claim, wherein the housing halves have associated latch sections, respectively, and, upon the assembling of the housing halves into the housing, the latch sections define a latch in which a support frame is fitted.
8. A component for an optical transmission system including an optical connector which comprises a receptacle according to any preceding claim.
