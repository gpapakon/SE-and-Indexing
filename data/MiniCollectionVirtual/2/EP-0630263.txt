<ABSTRACT>
Use of  alpha -hydroxy acids and poly- alpha -hydroxy acids as spacer between a therapeutically and/or diagnostically active compound and a soluble macromolecular carrier in pharmaceutical compositions having site-specific delivery. In one embodiment glycolic acid, L-lactic acid or tetra-L-lactic acid is used as spacer between a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory substance and a carrier of low molecular protein (LMWP).

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a conjugate
having site-specific and in particular tissue-specific
delivery, in addition to a method for producing same.Pharmaceutical compositions having site-specific
delivery are sometimes made by starting from an inactive
variant ("prodrug") of a therapeutically or diagnostically
active substance which is converted into the active form
only after reaching a determined place in the body such as a
specific organ or tissue. Another possibility is the combining
of the active substance with a pharmaceutical carrier in
particle form, such as liposomes for instance, or a soluble
macromolecular carrier, such as polypeptides for instance,
which have a preference for a specific place in the human or
animal body and there release the active substance.In the case that a polypeptide or other soluble
macromolecular material is used as carrier for the active
substance, it is preferred to couple this carrier with the
active substance by covalent bonds. On arrival at the desired
location in the body these covalent bonds then have to
be broken, this such that the active substance is released.
Problems can however occur here. Despite the fact that many
macromolecular carriers are biologically degradable, they
sometimes do not release the active substance in the correct
form or at the desired rate. In order to obviate this problem
molecules of a compound serving as spacer can be linked
between the active substance and the carrier, but the selection
of a suitable spacer results in turn in new problems.
With a view to an efficient and/or controlled decoupling of
the active substance and the carrier, particular attention
must be given to the nature of the active substance, the
type of covalent bond of the active substance to the spacer
and also to the length and branching degree of the spacer.
The spacer itself and its breakdown products must further be
non-toxic. It has now been found during further research that
α-hydroxy acids and poly-α-hydroxy acids are eminently
suitable for use as spacer between an active substance and a
soluble macromolecular carrier provided the active substance
has a terminal carboxyl group. The α-hydroxy acids can
namely be bonded by esterification (between the α-hydroxy
group of the α-hydroxy acid and the carboxyl group of the
active substance) to the active substance and be moreover
coupled by any covalent bond (between the carboxyl group of
the α-hydroxy acid and a reactive group of the macromolecular
carrier) to the soluble macromolecular carrier. Both
types of
