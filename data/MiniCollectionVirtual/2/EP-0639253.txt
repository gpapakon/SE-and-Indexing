<ABSTRACT>
A forced flow steam generator with an evaporator heating surface (4) has a control device for the furnace piloted by a reference value L allocated to the steam generator output and a control device (6) for the mass flow M of the supply water into the evaporator heating surface (4). To prevent any overshoot of the specific enthalpy at the outlet of the evaporator heating surface (4), a device (8) is superimposed on the supply water regulating device (6) which is used as a reference Ms for the mass flow of the supply water to form the quantity Q(L1)/(hsA(L2) - hiE). Here, hiE is the specific enthalpy at the inlet of the evaporator heating surface (4), Q(L1) is the value of the flow of heat into the evaporator heating surface (4) taken at a first power figure L1 from a function generator (10 to 14) and hsA(L2) is the reference derived with a second power figure L2 from the function generator for the specific enthalpy at the outlet from the evaporator heating surface (4). L1 is a first power figure which is delayed in relation to the reference L allocated to the steam generator output and L2 is a second power figure which is delayed in relation to the first power figure L1.
