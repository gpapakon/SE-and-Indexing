<ABSTRACT>
The disclosure is directed to improved techniques and devices employing an aluminum-bearing III-V semiconductor material and a native oxide of aluminum that is formed in the semiconductor material. In a form of the disclosure, two linear arrays of end-coupled minicavities, defined by a native oxide of an aluminum-bearing III-V semiconductor material, are arranged side by side to obtain a two dimensional array, with resultant lateral coupling between the linear arrays. The two dimensional array exhibits mode switching and multiple switching in the light power (L) versus current (I) characteristic (L-I) with increasing current. In another form of the disclosure, a stripe laser (1210) is transversely coupled (or side-coupled) with a linear array of end-coupled minicavities (1221-1275). Bistability and switching are demonstrated in the light versus current (L-I) characteristic of a native-oxide-defined structure of this type.

<DESCRIPTION>
 SEMICONDUCTOR OPTICAL DEVICES AND TECHNIQUESFIELD OF THE INVENTIONThis invention relates to semiconductor devices and, more particularly, to techniques which employ a grown native oxide of aluminum to obtain improvements in III-V semiconductor lasers and waveguides, and also relates to semiconductor lasers which exhibit improved properties, including improved single mode operation, optical switching and bistability.The present invention was made, in part, with U.S. Government support, and the U.S. Government has certain rights in this invention.BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTIONSemiconductor lasers in the shape of a ring, or a partial ring, have been known in the art for a number of years. Reference can be made, for example, to J. Carran et al., IEEE J. Quantum Electron. QE-6 367 (1970); A.S.H. Liao et al., Appl. Phys. Lett. 36, 801 (1980); and P. Sansonetti et al.. Electron Lett. 23, 485 (1988). These types of devices have various applications and proposed applications. For example, it has been proposed that a semiconductor ring laser, in which light circulates in both clockwise and counter-clockwise directions, could be used as a very small and inexpensive gyroscope. Briefly, certain motion of the gyroscope would have a different effect on the clockwise and counter-clockwise light components, and the effect can be measured to determine the motion or orientation of the device. Ring lasers, or "circular resonators" have also been proposed for applications such as filtering and multiplexing in so-called opto¬ electronic or integrated optical circuits. Fractions of a ring, such as a half-ring or a quarter-ring, with cleaved 

 facets, have been used for various applications in optical communications.In a ring laser the curved light path makes optical confinement more difficult. Because of the greater incident angles the light subtends with respect to the confining walls (particularly for a small radius of curvature), the difference in indices of refraction must be relatively large to ensure internal reflection of sufficient light in the ring laser "waveguide". It is among the objects of the present invention to overcome difficulties in the prior art of producing a laser in the shape of a ring or having a curved light path, for example part of a ring or a non-circular arc.Another application where control of index of refraction is important is in coupled-stripe laser diode arrays. These arrays offer the possibility of obtaining high output powers with decreased beam divergence and single-longitudinal mode
