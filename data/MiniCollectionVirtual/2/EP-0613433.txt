<ABSTRACT>
A device for transporting passengers and goods has at least one stationary magnetic track (2) for carrying a vehicle (1) provided with a magnetic levitation device. The vehicle (1) can also be provided with a driving mechanism for street traffic. The vehicle (1) is designed as an individual vehicle with an interchangeable energy supply block (13) for street traffic. The energy supply block (13) may be removed in the area of coupling points of the magnetic track (2) and loaded in the area of uncoupling points of the magnetic track (2). After passing the coupling points and joining the magnetic track (2), the vehicle can be accelerated by magnetic fields acting along the magnetic track (2) in high speed areas. After leaving the magnetic track (2), the vehicle (1) may be driven by another driving system.
