<ABSTRACT>
An improved process for making pigmented, microcellular polyurethane elastomers by reacting a resin component and an isocyanate-terminated prepolymer is disclosed. The resin component includes a polyol and two chain extenders, one of which is 1,3-propanediol or a branched C3-C5 diol. The chain extender combination enables successful elastomer processing throughout a broad range (at least a 5  DEG C) of molding temperatures and surprisingly overcomes pigment-induced problems with processability and physical properties. The process is ideal for making polyurethane shoe soles and midsoles.

<DESCRIPTION>
 PROCESS FOR MAKING MICROCELLULAR POLYURETHANE ELASTOMERS WITH IMPROVED PROCESSABILITYFIELD OF THE INVENTION The invention relates to a way to improve processability in the preparation of microceliular elastomers. In particular, the invention improves the processing characteristics and physical properties of microceliular elastomers that contain a pigment.BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTIONMicroceliular polyurethane elastomers are well known, as is illustrated, for example, by U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,728,745 and 5,250,582. These references and others teach the value of using polyether polyols having very low unsaturation levels to make the elastomers. In making shoe soles, these microceliular products are valuable because of their reduced shrinkage compared with elastomers made with conventional polyols that have higher unsaturation levels (see column 22 of U.S. Pat. No. 5,728,745).A typical microceliular polyurethane elastomer formulation reacts a polyol or mixture of polyols with water, an amine blowing catalyst, an organometallic urethane catalyst, one or more chain extenders, and a surfactant with an organic polyisocyanate (e.g., TDI, MDI, or the like).Various processes are known for combining the reactants. In the common"one-shot" approach, the "B side" components (polyols, surfactants, catalysts, chain extenders, and water) are pre-mixed before combining and reacting them with the polyisocyanate ("A side"). Another approach is called the "prepolymer method." In this method, a prepolymer is prepared, usually by reacting the polyisocyanate with a portion of the polyols, chain extenders, or both to give an NCO-terminated intermediate. The NCO-terminated prepolymer is then reacted with a resin component or "B side" (a mixture of water, catalysts, surfactant, and the remaining amounts of polyol and/or chain extender) to produce the microceliular elastomer. 

 A pigment is often included in the formulation. Typical pigments are carbon black, titanium dioxide, iron oxides, or the like. While pigments are often a necessary part of the formulation, they can adversely affect both elastomer processability and physical/mechanical properties. We found that black pigments (e.g., carbon black) can interfere with processability of an otherwise acceptable microceliular elastomer formulation. Moreover, when products can be made, they often lack the required physical properties for high-performance applications.A possible solution is to use a mixture of chain extenders.
