<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a process for the production of inorganic diffractive elements, in particular of glass, by etching, in which a substrate is covered by a mask which is resistant to the etch medium and covers the areas not to be etched and corresponds to the relief structure to be produced, the desired relief is then produced in the substrate in the areas not covered by the mask by means of an etching process, and subsequently, if necessary, the mask is removed again. The invention consists in that, before application of the mask, an interface between two different materials having different etching behaviour which is utilised as an etch resist is produced in the substrate in order to fix a defined etching depth at a defined distance from the substrate surface which corresponds to the structure depth to be produced. This has the advantage that even planar relief structures having low structural depth can be produced in high accuracy and reproducibility.

Method for the production of inorganic
diffractive elements, in particular from glass, by

etching, in which a substrate is coated with a mask which
covers those parts which are not to be etched, is resistant

to the etchant and corresponds to the relief structure
to be produced, the desired relief is then produced

in the substrate at the points not covered by the mask,
using an etching method, and if necessary the mask is

subsequently removed, an interface, which is used as an
etch stop, between two different materials having different

etching characteristics, being produced in the
substrate before application of the mask, in order to set

a defined etching depth, at a defined distance from the
substrate surface, which corresponds to the structural

depth to be set, characterized in that, in order to
produce the interface, the substrate is provided with an

etch-stop coating and a further coating that is to be
structured, the thickness of the coating that is to be

structured corresponding to the structural depth of the
relief structure.
