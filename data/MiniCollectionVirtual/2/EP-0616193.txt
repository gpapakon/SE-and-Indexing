<ABSTRACT>
A force-sensing system suitable, for example, for atomic force 
microscopy. This system includes a rocking beam (10), a base (40), and means (20) 

for supporting the beam adjacent a surface of the base such that the beam can pivot 
about at least one axis parallel to the base surface. In contrast to rocking-beam 

systems of the prior art, the support means comprise at least one pivot element that 
can be held against the base surface by a magnetic field.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to the field of force-sensing systems such as those 
used in scanning force microscopy. More particularly, this invention relates to those 
systems that incorporate a force-sensing element comprising a rocking beam. Force-sensing elements are widely used in scanning force microscopy. 
Rocking beam techniques have been applied in some of these systems. Rocking 
beam sensors are potentially advantageous because, in principle, they can be 
mechanically simple, rugged, highly sensitive, and relatively inexpensive to 
manufacture. In particular, these sensors offer high performance because they can be 
stabilized by a force-feedback servo loop. A further advantage of rocking beam 
sensors is that they can be used for a variety of microforce-sensing applications, 
including the measurement of tilt or acceleration. However, previous attempts to 
provide a rocking beam sensor have not been entirely satisfactory. Practitioners 
have found that pivoting mechanisms that offer sufficient sensitivity in the rocking 
direction generally tend to be fragile and too easily damaged during routine 
handling. At least some sensors have been found to be difficult to fabricate. The 
rocker elements of at least some of these sensors have proven difficult to remove and 
replace. (Rapid replacement is important in scanning force microscopy, for 
example. This is because the finely pointed probe tips, which are permanently 
mounted on the rocker elements, break or wear out relatively quickly.) Moreover, 
practitioners have encountered difficulties in stabilizing the rocker elements against 
undesired modes of mechanical motion. For example, a rocking beam sensor fabricated from a thin sheet of 
beryllium-copper alloy is described in S.A. Joyce et al., "A new force sensor 
incorporating force-feedback control for interfacial force microscopy," Rev.Sci. 
Instrum.62 (1991) 710 - 715. This sensor is a differential capacitance displacement 
sensor in which a common capacitor plate is suspended by torsion bars. The 
common capacitor plate and the torsion bars are integral with the beryllium-copper 
alloy sheet. Practitioners using this sensor have found that planarity of the rocker, 
which is essential to proper operation, is difficult to maintain because the beryllium-copper 
sheet tends to bend. Practitioners have also found that sensitivity is limited 
by stiffness of the torsion bars in the rocking direction, and that unwanted degrees of  
 
mechanical freedom make a substantial contribution to measurement
