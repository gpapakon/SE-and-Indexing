<ABSTRACT>
In this method, the received signal is sampled, it is filtered with a band-pass filter which exhibits complex-valued coefficients, is then differentiated and the desired phase increment is then obtained after an absolute value has been formed. A very inexpensive method which is recommended for use, in particular, in the demodulation of VHF FM signals.
