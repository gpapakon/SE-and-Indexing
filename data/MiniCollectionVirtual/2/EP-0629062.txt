<ABSTRACT>
A digital input signal (S1) has a break in transmission, dephasing the N signal sampling clock by T/N, where T is the period. The signal passes to a local clock, with a monitoring system (3) across it, sampling at a rate CK1,..,CK10. A high bit rate (155 Mb/s) is considered. If a break is found an intermediate signal (5) is generated, and is then replaced by rephasing circuits (7-10) which operate with respect to the local clock frequency.
