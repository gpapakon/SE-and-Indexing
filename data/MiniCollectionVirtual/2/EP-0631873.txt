<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an ink jet printer
for printing by jetting ink droplets, and more particularly
relates to a maintenance station employed therewith to cap and
apply suction to a nozzle of an ink jet head in order to achieve
and maintain printing quality.Non-impact recording methods recently have been
employed because printing noise is reduced and such methods are
suitable for color printing. Many new ink jet printers employ
such methods and provide high speed recording and can be
employed to be an ordinary paper. Drop-on-demand type ink jet
printers widely are used as output equipment of personal
computers because means for recovering waste ink are unnecessary
and because such type printer can be miniaturized and of simple
structure. This type of ink jet printer may be divided roughly
into the heat machine transformation type and the electric
machine transformation type.The heat machine transformation type has an electric
circuit mounted along the path of liquid passing to a nozzle.
Ink is ejected by steam pressure on applying electric current
and heat. This type of ink jet printer is suitable for miniaturization.
However, scorching can occur over long periods of
use. Therefore, special ink must be used to prevent such
scorching.The electric machine transformation type uses deformation
occurring by applying an electric field to energy supply
means in the form of a piezoelectric element. Use is not
limited to a particular ink and this ink which is most suitable
to obtain quality printing for a particular use can be employed.
This type printer however requires a large space for the energy
supply means and therefore is not suitable for miniaturization.For resolving this problem, an ink jet for supplying
energy to liquid by deformation of a side wall by utilizing 
electric deformation of a shear node type is shown in Japanese
Laid Open Patent Application 150355/1990. The most important
feature is to give eject energy to liquid by deformation of a
side wall which opens to a nozzle. Therefore, liquid paths may
be arranged in a plane with an interval between nozzles.In such ink jet printer, when an ink jet head is
changed, when the printer is started after a long period of
time, or when printing quality is reduced during printing, old
ink is exhausted from the ink jet head by applying suction to a
nozzle hole from a rubber cap pressed to a face of a plate of
the nozzle. The circumference of the cap is pressed against the
nozzle plate to seal the interior of the cap. At such time, an
interior
