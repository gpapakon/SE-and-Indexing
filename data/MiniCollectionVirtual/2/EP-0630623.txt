<ABSTRACT>
A stent-loading mechanism for automatically 
loading a stent onto a balloon delivery catheter of the 

kind used in typical percutaneous transluminal coronary 
angioplasty (PTCA) procedures. The device comprises a 

pair of plates (120,100) having substantially flat and parallel surfaces 
(125,130) that move in a rectilinear fashion with respect to each other. 

A stent-carrying catheter can be disposed between these surfaces to 
affix the stent onto the outside of the catheter by providing relative 

motion between the plates. The plates may have multiple degrees of 
freedom and force-indicating transducers to measure and indicate the 

force applied to the catheter during affixation of the stent. 
Another embodiment of the stent-loading machine 
comprises a tubular member housing (5) an elongated elastic bladder (20) 

that surrounds the stent to be loaded. The distal end of the balloon 
catheter assembly and the stent are placed inside the tubular member and 

pressurized fluid is applied to the bladder to compress and affix the 
stent onto the outside of the catheter assembly.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a stent-loading 
device that will automatically load a stent onto the 
distal end of a balloon dilatation catheter assembly, for 
example, of the kind used in typical percutaneous 
transluminal coronary angioplasty (PTCA) procedures. In typical PTCA procedures, a guiding catheter 
is percutaneously introduced into the cardiovascular 
system of a patient through the brachial or femoral 
arteries and advanced through the vasculature until the 
distal end of the guiding catheter is in the ostium. A 
guidewire and a dilatation catheter having a balloon on 
the distal end are introduced through the guiding 
catheter with the guidewire sliding within the dilatation 
catheter. The guidewire is first advanced out of the 
guiding catheter into the patient's coronary vasculature 
and the dilatation catheter is advanced over the previously 
advanced guidewire until the dilatation balloon 
is properly positioned across the lesion. Once in 
position across the lesion, a flexible, expandable, 
preformed balloon is inflated to a predetermined size 
with a radiopaque liquid at relatively high pressures to 
radially compress the atherosclerotic plaque of the 
lesion against the inside of the artery wall and thereby 
dilate the lumen of the artery. The balloon is then 
deflated to a small profile, so that the dilatation 
catheter can be withdrawn from the patient's vasculature 
and blood flow resumed through the dilated artery. As 
should be appreciated by those skilled in the art, while 
the procedure just described is typical, it is not the 
only method used in angioplasty.  In angioplasty procedures of the kind referenced 
above, there may be restenosis of the artery, which 
may require another angioplasty procedure, a surgical 
bypass operation, or some method of repairing or 
strengthening the area. To reduce the chance of 
restenosis and strengthen the area, a physician can 
implant an intravascular prosthesis for maintaining 
vascular patency, typically designated by the term called 
a stent, inside the artery at the lesion. The stent 
typically is expanded to a larger diameter, often by the 
balloon portion of the catheter. The stent may be of the 
self-expanding type. This invention is directed to a vascular 
prosthesis loading device, which automatically loads a 
stent onto the distal end of a catheter assembly with a 
minimum of human handling, to better and more 
consistently secure the stent onto the catheter before 
the stent is delivered through the patient's vasculature. The
