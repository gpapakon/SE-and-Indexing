<ABSTRACT>
The fixture incorporates further fixture components for connecting the bridge beam with the bearer. The guide component (4) engages around the bearer (1) with laterally extending downwards holding strips (6) on both sides, which are connected with the guide strips (5) to form a hollow box. At least one intermediate plate (7) is arranged between the bridge beam (2) and the bearer (1). The bridge beam is of steel and above the underside of a strap (8) locating on the bearer has laterally open areas. The fixture components are screws passing through the strap of the bridge beam, the intermediate plate and the bearer, joining them all together.

Bridge girder (2) with means for connection to supports 
(1) of a steel railway bridge, wherein the connection means 

comprise a guide element (4) releasably connected to the 
support, with guide rails (5) disposed laterally next to the 

base of the bridge girder and further connection elements for 
connection of the bridge girder to the support, characterised 

in that 

the guide element (4) surrounds the support (1) with 
lateral holding rails (6) protruding downwards from both 

sides which are connected with the guide rails (5) to a 
hollow casing, 
at least one intermediate plate (7) is disposed between the 
bridge girder (2) and the support (1), and 
the bridge girder (2) consists of steel and comprises 
laterally open regions above the lower side of a flange (8) 

lying on the support (1). 
Bridge girder according to claim 1, characterised in that 
the connection elements are screws (11) which pass through 

the flange (8) of the bridge girder (2), the intermediate 
plate (7) and the support (1) and connect them to each other. 
Bridge girder according to claim 1, characterised in that 
the connection elements are connected to the guide element 

(4). 
Bridge girder according to claim 3, characterised in that 
at least one of the holding rails (6) is provided with a 

clamping device (14) which braces the guide element (4) 
against an under-side or a profile projection of the support 

(1) and/or at least one of the guide rails (5) is provided 
with a holding down device (18) overlapping the flange (8) of 

the bridge girder (2) and bracing it.  
 
Bridge girder according to one or more of claims 1 to 4, 
characterised in that it is formed as an I-beam. 
Bridge girder according to claim 4, characterised in that 
the clamping device (14) and/or holding down device (18) is 

formed as a screw connection. 
Bridge girder according to claim 4 or 6, characterised in 
that the holding down devices (18) protruding into the open 

regions of the bridge girder (2) are releasably connected to 
the holding rails (6). 
Bridge girder according to one or more of claims 1 to 7, 
characterised in that between the support (1) and the bridge 

girder (2) a plurality of intermediate plates (7, 10) of 
equal or different thickness are inserted. 
Bridge girder according to claim 1 or 8, characterised in 
that at least one of the intermediate plates (7, 10) is 

wedge-shaped. 
Bridge girder according to one or more of claims 1, 8 or 
9, characterised in that at least one of the intermediate 

plates (7, 10) consists of a noise or vibration damping 
material.
