fitting member (19) and mounting fitting member

(15),
c) said lifting means including a rolling body

means (33) having at least one rolling body,
d) said rolling body means having a rolling body
path that is inclined at least in a portion with

respect to the normal plane of the pivot axis
(43),
e) said lifting means (20) having a supporting member
(21) for axial connection of the door fitting

member (19) to the mounting fitting member
(15),
f) the rolling body arrangement (33) being disposed
between supporting member (21) and mounting fitting

member (15), and
g) of said mounting fitting member (15) and said
supporting member (21), one thereof being provided

with a rolling body receiving means (35)
and the other one thereof being provided with a

rolling body receiving trough (36), with at
least one thereof constituting a part of the

rolling body path,

characterized in
h) that said door fitting member (19) is axially
displaceable with respect to said supporting

member (21).
The door fitting of claim 1,

characterized in that said rolling body receiving
trough (36) is formed in said supporting member (21)

and constitutes a part of a rolling body path.
The door fitting of claim 1 or 2,

characterized in that said rolling body receiving
means (35) is formed in said mounting fitting member

(15) and constitutes a part of a rolling body path.
The door fitting of one or several ones of claims 1
to 3,

characterized in that the supporting member (21) and
the door fitting member (19) are designed to be axially

displaceable in interengaging manner and that
the door fitting member (19) is provided with an

adjusting means (89) acting axially on the supporting
member (21).
The door fitting of claim 4,

characterized in that the supporting member (21), at
least in a portion (guiding portion 25), is adapted

to be received in axially movable manner in a supporting
member receiving means (23) of said door

fitting member (19).
The door fitting of claim 4 or 5,

characterized in that the adjusting means (89) comprises
an adjusting screw (93) adapted to be received
