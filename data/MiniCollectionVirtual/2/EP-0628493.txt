<ABSTRACT>
The improved inner sealing material comprises basically a 
membrane layer (15) having at least a metal layer (12) and a 

reseal layer (14) having at least an elastic sheet layer (3) 
with said membrane and reseal layers (15, 14) being superposed 

in such a way that one can be separated from the other. The 
topmost part of the membrane layer (15) comprises a release 

layer (9) that is made of a mixture of an acrylic resin and a 
chlorinated vinyl acetate base resin and which is overlaid with 

an adhesive layer (10) made of a chlorinated polypropylene base 
resin, whereas the bottommost part of the reseal layer (14) 

comprises a polypropylene base resin layer (8). The inner 
sealing material can be subjected to high-frequency sealing 

without losing the inherent capability of assuring smooth 
separation between the membrane (15) 
and reseal (14) layers.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to an inner sealing material
for closing the mouth of a container and, more
particularly, to an inner sealing material of a type that
is to become effective by high-frequency sealing.The mouths of containers of powdered or granular
materials such as instant coffee, powder milk and
flavorings are fitted with inner sealing material which is
fitted into the cap of container for protecting the
contents from deterioration in quality due to various
factors such as contact with moisture and oxidation. The
inner sealing material is the combination of a reseal layer
that is based on an elastic sheet such as cardboard and a
membrane layer (seal layer) that is based on a metal foil
such as aluminum foil. When the container is uncapped, the
reseal layer is separated from the membrane layer and
remains in the cap whereas the membrane layer is left on
the mouth of the container. When the cap is replaced on the
mouth of the container, the reseal layer is superposed on
the membrane layer (which may be removed either partly or
entirely) so that it combines with the cap to prevent the
entrance of moisture, oxygen, etc. into the container.To bond the membrane layer onto the mouth of the
container, emulsion base adhesives have heretofore been 
used, but this has involved several problems when the user
attempts to open the container by peeling the membrane
layer from its mouth; to name a few, "picking", or the
destruction of the glassine paper used in the membrane,
occurs, and difficulty is encountered in peeling the
membrane layer neatly. With a view to solving these
problems, a high-frequency sealing method has been
developed as a technique that enables the mouth of a
container to be sealed with a thin film that can be bonded
to the mouth in a fast and easy way and which yet can be
peeled neatly as required at a later time (see, for
example, Japanese Patent Publication (kokoku) Nos.
Sho 61-9181 and 63-28019, and Hei 3-2754).This high-frequency sealing method causes the metal
layer in the inner sealant to generate heat when it is
placed in a magnetic field and the thus generated heat is
utilized to fuse the thermal bonding resin layer (glass
seal layer) at the bottom of the membrane layer, thereby
providing an effective seal. However, if this method is
applied to the conventional inner sealants, serious
problems have occurred in association with the ability to
insure effective separation between the reseal and membrane
layers, as exemplified by the loss in the ability of the
release layer (which
