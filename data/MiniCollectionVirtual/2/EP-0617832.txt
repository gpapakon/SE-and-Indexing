<ABSTRACT>
The shutter device proposed comprises a sliding shutter (5) located behind the front shutter (1) covering the front of the data-processing unit except for the storage units (2), the sliding shutter having a tab (7) which projects out through a lit between the front shutter (1) and the casing (6). Located on at least one of the edges of the sliding shutter (5) parallel to the direction in which the shutter moves is a notch-like recess (10) into which the arm (9) of a rotating-arm lock (8) can be turned and locked in place.

<CLAIMS>
Data processing unit with at least one storage 
unit for portable data media which can be loaded in and 

removed from the data processing unit via the front side, 
and with a horizontally movable slide shutter which 

covers the storage unit and can be locked in the closed 
state by means of a key-operable swivel-lever lock, 

characterized in that the slide shutter (5) is arranged 
behind a front panel (1) covering the front side of the 

data processing unit with the exception of the storage 
unit (2) and has a gripping element (7) protruding out of 

a separating slit between front panel (1) and the housing 
(6) of the data processing unit, and in that the slide 

shutter (5) has on at least one of the bounding edges 
running parallel to the sliding direction a groove-like 

clearance (10) for a swivel lever (9) of the swivel-lever 
lock (8), which lever can, in the blocking state, be 

swivelled in and locked. 
Data processing unit according to Claim 1, 
characterized in that, with a front panel (1) having a U-shaped 

cross section, the slide shutter (5) has at least 
one leg extension which is angled off in an L-shaped 

manner, runs parallel to the U-leg of the front panel (1) 
and reaches as far as the separating slit bet
ween front 
panel (1) and housing (6) of the data processing unit. 
Data processing unit according to Claim 1 or 2, 
characterized in that the slide shutter (5) is designed 

to be of such a size that it extends beyond the covering 
region of the storage units (2) such that a switch (4) 

for switching the unit on and off is additionally 
covered.
