<ABSTRACT>
A vertical wall in constructions such as swimming pools may be formed using a composite sheet (4) made up of three layers, viz. a first flat layer (2), a second corrugated layer (2) and a third thin layer (3) which, in use, acts as left-in formwork for casting reinforced concrete piles in the space (21) formed at intervals between sheets (2) and (3). This method is suitable for building swimming pools of any shape or size.
