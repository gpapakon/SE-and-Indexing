<ABSTRACT>
The invention concerns a stabilized culture of proembryogenic cellular aggregates of vine rootstock 41B filed under no PL92042917 with the ECACC collection, their variants and derived cultures, a process for the multiplication of this culture enabling it to preserve its embryogenic power and its stabilized state, a process for the development of embryos from a proembryogenic strain for use in vine regeneration techniques, a regenerated vine and use of the stabilized culture, especially for the transformation of proembryogenic cells by a suitable vector.

<CLAIMS>
Process for developing embryos from a
proembryogenic strain intended for the

regeneration of vine, 
characterized in that
 the
strain is cultured between 3 and 7 days in an

auxin-free liquid culture medium and then
subcultured daily until plantlets are obtained in

which two generally green well-developed
cotyledons and a long root are distinguished.
Process according to Claim 1, 
characterized in
that
, on each subculturing, the density of the
culture is brought back to the initial inoculation

density.
Process according to either of Claims 1 and 2,

characterized in that
 the cell inoculation density
is between 0.5 and 2 µl/ml, preferably between 1

and 2 µl/ml.
Process according to one of Claims 1 to 3,

characterized in that
 the strain consists, during
the initial inoculation, of cellular aggregates

between 200 and 500 µm in size.
Process according to Claim 4, 
characterized in
that
 the aggregates are obtained by culturing the
strain, preferably in an appropriate liquid

culture medium in the presence of auxin, then they 
are filtered successively using a filter having a

porosity of about 500 µm in order to remove the
larger-size aggregates, then using a filter having

a porosity of about 200 µm and finally washed
preferably with the appropriate auxin-free liquid

culture medium so as to remove all traces of
auxin.
Process according to one of Claims 1 to 5,

characterized in that
 the strain is a stabilized
culture of proembryogenic cellular aggregates

deposited under No. PL92042917 at the ECACC
collection, their variants and derived cultures

which have preserved comparable proembryogenic
properties.
Process according to Claim 6, 
characterized in
that
 the stabilized culture can develop at least
100 embryos per mg of cells.
