<ABSTRACT>
Sheets with images are scanned to determine if 
the images are acceptable. Sheets with unacceptable 

images are marked with a reject mark. The images 
may define banknotes,
 securities, traveler checks, 
stamps, and so on.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention pertains to an apparatus for checking
printed matter, and more particularly for checking continuous
or discrete sheets with multiple images, such as
banknotes, stamps, securities and so on.Certain printed matter or documents such as banknotes,
stamps, securities, travelers checks and so forth
require complicated printing procedures to prevent unauthorized
duplication, copying or counterfeiting. Inherently,
this material must be printed accurately, since mistakes
are taken as an indication that the material is not
genuine. Of course complicated printing processes increase
the chances of producing printed matter which
has mistakes. Thus after completion, these documents
must be checked carefully, and the documents with mistakes
must be rejected. To the knowledge of the applicants,
to date this checking is performed manually, on
a one to one basis. The applicants are unaware of any
automated systems capable of checking printed matter
on line and of rejecting the unaccepted documentsThe EP-A-0 485,694 discloses a printed document
checker for checks, bonds etc. The apparatus contains
a scanner and a data processing means in the form of
a comparison unit which compares the data from the
scanner with stored models.In view of the above-mentioned problems, it is an
objective of the present invention to provide an apparatus
for automatically checking and rejecting printed matter.A further objective is to provide a apparatus which
can perform document checking continuously on line
without the need for human intervention.Yet a further objective is to provide a flexible system
which can perform its function at high speed.Other objectives and advantages of the invention
shall become apparent from the following description. A
printed matter checking apparatus in accordance with
this invention is defined in claim 1. The printed matter
to be checked consists of images which are printed normally
in two dimensional arrays on sheets. These
sheets are sequentially fed to the subject apparatus,
where they are scanned and if necessary to a reject station
for rejection. Preferably, the reject station is adapted
to receive specific identifying data from the microprocessor
which identifies a specific document on the sheet
to be rejected. The identified document is rejected for
example by printing thereon a specific word or a message.A printing and checking apparatus in accordance
with the invention is defined in claim 6 and a method of
checking in accordance with the invention is defined in
claim 10.

</DESCRIPTION>
<CLAIMS>
Printed matter checking apparatus comprising a scanning
station (18,20) for receiving sequentially a plurality of

sheets (10) having printed images (16) arranged in a two-dimensional
array, said scanning station (18,20) generating

data (26,28) descriptive of said images and data processing
means (30) receiving said data for analyzing said data to

determine whether said images meet preselected criteria,
wherein each sheet (10) has a plurality of documents each

document being defined by an image (16) either on one
surface or on both surfaces (22,24) of the sheet (10), and

wherein the apparatus comprises a marking station (32)
coupled to said data processing means (30) for receiving

sheets sequentially (10) from said scanning station
(18,20), 
characterised in that
 said marking station (32)

comprises a set of printer devices (34) arranged in an
array identical to said array of images (16) for marking

with a reject mark any documents defined by at least one
image (16') which said data processing means (30) has

determined does not meet said criteria.  
The apparatus of claim 1 wherein each said sheet (10)
has a top surface (22) with top images (16) and a bottom

surface (24) with bottom images (16), each top image being
registered with a bottom image to define one document.
The apparatus of claim 1 wherein said marking station
(32) marks said top image.
The apparatus of claim 3 wherein each of said printing
heads (34) consists of an impact printer. 
The apparatus of claim 3 wherein each of said printing
heads (34) consists of an ink jet printer.
A printing and checking apparatus comprising a printing
device (12,14) for printing a plurality of documents on a

sheet (10), each document being defined by an image (16)
either on one surface or both surfaces (22,24) of the sheet

(10), said images (16) being arranged in a two-dimensional
array, scanning means (18,20) for receiving said sheet (10)

from said printing device (12,14) and for generating data
(26,28) descriptive of said images (16), data processing

means (30) for receiving said data and comparing said data
to a preselected criteria to determine if each of said

images is acceptable and marking means (32,34) for
receiving said sheet (10), 
characterised in that
 said
marking means (32,34) comprise a set of printer devices

(34) arranged in an array identical to said array of images
(16) for marking with a reject mark any documents defined

by at least one image (16') which said data processing
means (30) has determined does not meet said criteria.
The apparatus of claim 6 wherein said sheet (10) has a
top (22) and a bottom surface (24) and said printing device

prints top (12,14) and bottom images (16) on said top and
bottom surfaces respectively.
The apparatus of claim 7 wherein said scanning means
includes a top (18) and bottom scanner (20) for scanning

said top (22) and bottom (24) surfaces respectively.
The apparatus of claim 7 wherein each said top image
(16) is in register with each said bottom image (16) to 

define a document, and wherein said marking means (34)
marks said top image (16) of said document when one of said

top and bottom images (16') of said document are
unacceptable.
A method of checking images (16) on sheets comprising
the steps of scanning said sheets (10) sequentially to

generate data descriptive of said images (16), comparing
data for each image (16) to preselected criteria to

determine if the image meet the preselected criteria,
wherein the sheet comprises a plurality of documents each

of which is defined by an image (16) either on one surface
or both surfaces of the sheet (10), the images of the

documents being arranged in a two-dimensional array and
wherein the method includes the step of marking with a

reject mark any documents defined by at least one image
(16') which have been determined do not meet preselected

criteria 
characterised in that
 the step of marking is
carried out with printer devices arranged in an array

identical to said array of images.
The method of claim 10 wherein each document is defined
by a top and bottom image (16) disposed on a top (22) and

bottom (24) surface of said sheet (10), and wherein said
top image of a document is marked with said reject mark if

one of said top and bottom images of said document is
unacceptable.
The method of claim 10 wherein said sheet (10) has a
top and bottom surface with top and bottom images, said top

and bottom images being scanned during said scanning step.
