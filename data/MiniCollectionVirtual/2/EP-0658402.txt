<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a device which can be fitted onto a robotic vehicle for negotiating obstacles when going up and when coming down. This device comprises at least one bearing bar (6) which can rotate about an axle (A2) parallel to the axle of rotation (A1) of the wheel (4) and which is fixed to the chassis (2) of the vehicle. Rotation means include either two actuators or one actuator associated with a freewheel system allowing independent rotation of the bearing bar with respect to the wheel. Application to robotic industrial vehicles.
