vehicle, consisting essentially of a binder which is a
thermoplastic elastomer, an energetic plasticizer, an

oxidizing charge and additives designed to regulate
combustion, characterized in that the said binder is an

oxygenated thermoplastic elastomer, in that the said
plasticizer is a product of the polymerization of glycidyl

azide and in that at least 85 % of the weight of the
oxidizing charge consists of ammonium nitrate.
Pyrotechnic composition according to claim 1,
characterized in that the said binder is an aliphatic block

copolymer mainly consisting of polyamide units and
polyether units.

characterized in that the said binder is an aliphatic block

copolymer having the formula :


in which :

C, H, O represent carbon, hydrogen and oxygen
respectively,
PA represents the polyamide block obtained by
condensation of dodecanedioic acid with 1,12-dodecanediamine,
PE represents a polyether block obtained by
condensation of tetramethylene glycol,
n represents a whole number between 2 and 10.

combination represents between 5 and 15 % of the total
weight of the composition.
Pyrotechnic composition according to claim 7,
characterized in that the weight of the energetic

plasticizer represents approximately 30 % of the weight of
the binder/plasticizer combination.
