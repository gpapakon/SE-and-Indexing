<ABSTRACT>
In order to measure differences in height between a base unit 10 and a mobile unit 14 movable relative to the former, in particular for measuring height differences in tunnelling cutter machines, in the case of which a bored tunnel or a drain is lined by compressing tubes, the base unit and mobile unit are connected together by a hose 18. The hose 18 is connected to an open liquid reservoir 20, the liquid level 22 of which is above the hose 18, and is thereby filled with liquid under pressure. Pressure sensors 24 and 28 are fitted respectively to the base unit 10 and to the mobile unit 14, and responds to the pressure of the liquid in the hose 18. In addition, a device 30 for forming a pressure-difference signal, reproducing the pressure difference, from signals of the two pressure sensors 24, 28 is provided. The movement of the mobile unit 14 can be controlled in accordance with the pressure-difference signal.

A device for steering of tunnel boring machines, 
wherein a bored tunnel or a sewer is lined by pressing 

tubes into it, comprising means for measuring the level 
difference between a base unit (10) and a mobile unit 

(14) in the form of a tunnel boring machine movable 
relative thereto, characterized in that 


(a) the base unit (10) and the mobile unit (14) are 
interconnected by a hose (18), 
(b) the hose (18) communicates with an open liquid 
reservoir (20), the liquid level (22) of which lies 

above the hose (18), the hose, thereby, being 
filled with liquid under pressure, 
(c) pressure sensors (24,28) are attached to each the 
base unit (10) and the mobile unit (14), 

respectively, the pressure sensors responding to 
the respective pressures of the liquid under 

pressure, and 
(d) a device (30) for forming, from the signals of the 
two pressure sensors, a pressure difference signal 

representing the pressure difference, and 
(e) the movement of the mobile unit (14) is steered 
depending on the pressure difference signal. 
A device as claimed in claim 1, characterized in that a 
display (32) is present, to which the pressure 

difference signal is applied and which indicates the 
deviation of the pressure difference signal from a 

setpoint value.
