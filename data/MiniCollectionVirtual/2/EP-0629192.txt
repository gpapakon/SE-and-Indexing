<DESCRIPTION>
 Herbici dal ly active pyr1ra1d1ny1 and tr1az1nyl compoundsThe present invention relates to novel, herbicidally active pyrimidinyl and triazinyl ethers and thioethers, to processes for their preparation, to compositions comprising them as active ingredients, and to their use for controlling weeds, especially selectively in crops of useful plants.Pyrimidinyl and triazinyl ethers and thioethers having herbicidal action are generally known. Such compounds are described, for example, in European Patent Applications Nos.0400741 and 0409 369. The compounds disclosed therein are not always capable, however, of fulfilling requirements in terms of strength of action and selectivity. Novel herbicidally active pyrimidinyl and triazinyl ethers and thioethers have now been found.The pyrimidinyl and triazinyl ethers and thioethers according to the invention have the formula Iwherein Q is
