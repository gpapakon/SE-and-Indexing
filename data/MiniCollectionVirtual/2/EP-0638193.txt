<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a method for supervising the level of alertness of a person, especially a vehicle driver, and indication of a non-permitted increase or decrease of the level of alertness in order to generate a warning signal at such an indication. This is performed by registering an (EEG), which is continuously frequency analyzed. At simultaneous deviation in opposite directions from the normal awake state values within the frequency ranges 3-8 Hz and 9-12 Hz an alarm is arranged to be released.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method for supervising the level of
alertness of a person or individual, especially a vehicle driver, and
indication of a non-permitted increase or decrease of the level of alertness
in order to generate a warning signal at such an indication.It is wellknown that the level of alertness of certain individuals might
be too low with respect to the work they have to carry out. For certain
professional groups, e.g. certain vehicle drivers, as air craft pilots,truck-drivers
and locomotive drivers, it is very important that they have a very
high level of alertness when they are driving their respective vehicles.
It has become apparent, that especially air craft pilots after having been
subjected to hard strain often are affected by rapid fall into a state
of inactivity, which might be fatal. Similar phenomenons may affect air
craft pilots when they are subjected to so called gravity attraction action
during heavy accelerations. It is also known to locomotive drivers that
monotony and loneliness during long nightly working periods creates need
of sleep that moreover is amplified at the presence of infrasonic sound
at the working place. A study has recently been performed on locomotive
drivers wherein their EEG-signals were registered during nightly drivings
along a specific route. Especially towards the morning hours it happened
that they slumbered for up to 2-3 minutes. The registrations showed, that
the drivers were running the red lights and missed traffic signs. Not until
later they waked up and wondered what had happen. The tired or sleepy
individual thinks that the body should give a last warning signal and then
he intends to have a break. But no more warning signals appear, the sleepiness
per se is an attempt by the brain to stop activity, and at last it is
successful. Sleepiness is an underestimated cause of inability, and yet
we know the consequences: Tiredness makes us careless. In a gas generating
plant the routine readings were checked over a time period of 20 years.
A significant increase of misreads were observed during the night shifts.
Tiredness results in slow reactions. The worst ability was observed between
4 and 7 a.m. In this early time the one-car accidents are five times more
than later in the day. Also for many other professional groups, e.g. nuclear
power plant supervising personnel a too low level of alertness can result
in fatal consequences. We know now for instance that the Tjernobyl meltdown 
occurred at 01.35 a.m. and was caused by a fault

<CLAIMS>
Method for supervising the level of alertness of a person or
individual, especially a vehicle driver, and indication of non-permitted

increase or decrease of the level of alertness in order to generate a warning
signal at such an indication, 
characterized
 in that the electric
activity of the brain is supervised by registering an electroencephalogram,

which is continuously frequency analyzed, and in that an alarm (2,3) is
arranged to be released at a predetermined simultaneous deviation of said

registering in opposite directions from the normal awake state values within
two specific frequency ranges, a lower range (4) and a higher range (5),

where the deviations should amount to certain critical relative values.
Method according to claim 1, 
characterized
 in that
a specific type of alarm (2) representing a non-permitted low level of

alertness of the individual is used for being released if values representing
an increase of the activity of the brain are registered in the lower frequency

range (4) at the same time as values are registered representing a decrease
of the activity of the brain in the higher frequency range (5), and the

change as compared to the normal condition amounts to the predetermined,
critical relative values.
Method according to claim 1 or 2, 
characterized
 in
that a specific type of alarm (3) representing a non-permitted high level

of alertness of the individual is used for being released if values
representing a decrease of the activity of the brain are registered in

the lower frequency range (4) at the same time as values are registered
representing an increase of the activity of the brain in the higher frequency

range (5), and the change as compared to the normal condition amounts to
the predetermined, critical relative values.
Method according to any of the preceding claims, 
characterized
 in that the change relative to the normal condition includes
a change per unit of time of the activity of the brain that exceeds

stipulated, critical limit values.
Method according to any of the preceding claims, 
characterized
 
in that the lower frequency range is set to 3-8 Hz and the

higher one to 9-12 Hz.
