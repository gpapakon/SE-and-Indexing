<ABSTRACT>
In the method for operating heat exchangers by means of hot gas streams which have constituents capable of being condensed, the hot gas stream (1) is subdivided into component streams (4) by means of obstacles (3) at a temperature T which is low by comparison with the inlet temperature TE of the hot gas stream (1), in particular lower than the dew point temperature TT of the hot gas stream (1), and cooled. The component streams (4) are brought together with one another after leaving the obstacles (3) and are subdivided at their cores (8) into other component streams (6) by means of further obstacles (3) at the temperature T, and cooled. This process is repeated until the hot gas stream (7) leaving the heat exchanger (2) has reached an outlet temperature TA of 200 DEG C to 60 DEG C, preferably from 120 DEG C to 80 DEG C.
