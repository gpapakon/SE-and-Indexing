<ABSTRACT>
A serial printer has a pulse generator (25, 25a, 31) for generating timing pulses in a number 
proportional to the movement of a carriage mounting the printer's recording head. The pulse 

generator comprises an encoder (25) and a detector (31) moved relative to each other as the 
carriage is moved. The detector is responsive to marks (25a) provided on the encoder (25) for 

generating the timing pulses. Blocking means (33) are provided to block the detector (31) when 
the carriage is at a predetermined position such that the detector cannot detects any marks of 

the encoder as long as the blocking condition is maintained. Signal processing means are 
provided to recognize the blocked condition of the detector and to output a home position 

detection signal in response to it. In this way the pulse generator also functions as a home 
position detector obviating use of a separate home position detector.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a serial printer and, more particularly, it relates to means for detecting a
home position of the recording head of a serial printer. The invention also pertains to a method of
controlling the printer.US 4,869,609 A and US 5,158,379 A discloses a serial printer which comprises a recording
head, a carriage on which the recording head is mounted, a motor that drives the carriage, a dot
pulse generator composed of a slotted disc as a rotary encoder attached to the motor axis as
well as a first photo interrupter, and a home position detector composed of a second photo
interrupter for detecting a shield plate attached to the carriage. In this prior art, dot or timing
pulses put out by the first photo interrupter are required and used to detect the relative print
position (dot-to-dot distance) of the recording head during the printing operation. The output of
the second photo interrupter, i.e., the home position detector is needed to detect the home
position (the reference start-of-print position) for determining the recording head's absolute print
position. Thus, this prior art requires at least two separate detectors for its operation.JP 5-077 514 A discloses a serial printer similar to the one explained above. In this prior art,
however, a single detecting means is used for generating timing pulses on the one hand and for
detecting the home position of the carriage on the other hand. The detecting means comprises a
scale plate arranged to extend parallel to the direction of the reciprocating movement of the
carriage. The length of the scale plate substantially corresponds to the length of stroke of the
carriage. The scale plate has transmissive portions regularly spaced by opaque portions along the
length of the plate. No transmissive portions are provided in the scale plate at a position
corresponding to the home position of the carriage. A photo interrupter is mounted to the
carriage to engage with the scale plate and to generate timing pulses as the carriage moves
along the scale plate. From the fact that no timing pulses are generated for a certain period of
time longer than the normal interval between two successive timing pulses, a CPU detects that
the carriage is at its home position.While the prior art of JP 5 077 514 A needs only a single detector it has several disadvantages
such as the following. If a scale plate, i.e. a linear encoder of reasonable costs is employed, the
resolution that may be achieved, i.e. the number of timing pulses per unit travel distance of the
