<ABSTRACT>
A toll call service center accessible by subscribers to the service. Subscribers have their own set of identifiers uniquely associated with a plurality of called stations desired to be accessed. The center comprises a voice command system (10) having a storage (16) for storing representations of the identifiers at storage locations uniquely identified with the subscriber. Command system (10) also includes an announcing circuit and a processor (30). Processor (30) is responsive to reception of an incoming call from a subscriber for controlling the announcing circuit to request the subscriber to speak an identifier associated with one of the plurality of called stations. A voice recognizer (48) is responsive to receipt of the identifier for determining whether the identifier is valid. If the identifier is recognized as belonging to the subscriber, the processor controls an outdialer (24) to dial the telephone number of the called station associated with the identifier.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates generally to
telephone calling card services for permitting
telecommunications customers to access and effect
toll calls over a telephone network.Telephone "calling" cards are well-known in the
prior art. Such cards typically include a memory
comprising a magnetic tape or other storage media
affixed to the card. Data in this storage media
typically identifies the card number and the account
to which the card has been assigned, and it may also
comprise an authorized user's personal
identification number or "PIN." To effect a toll
call, the card is inserted into a cardreader (or the
bearer is prompted to enter the card data via the
telephone keypad) and relevant information is read
from the card for subsequent billing.Some cards include a data processing capability
in the form of a microprocessor and an associated
control program. Such "smart" cards have been used
in prior art voice command systems wherein it is
important to limit access to certain services to
only authorized users. For example, U.S. Patent No.
4,827,518 to Feustel et al describes a speaker
verification and voice command system wherein speech
templates are stored in the card. To verify the
user's identity, a comparison is made between a
plurality of reference speech templates stored in
the card and a test template formed from a word or
words spoken by the user at a transaction terminal.
A similar'system is described in U.S Patent No.
3,896,266 to Waterbury.Such prior art systems are effective but are
significantly complex and somewhat expensive. They
require the use of specialized hardware to generate
and store the coded information on the cards, as
well as the use of precise verification algorithms 
to discriminate the voice of an authorized user from all unauthorized users. Moreover,
prior art voice verification schemes do not always work effectively over the telephone
network. Generally, this is because the telephone network is a challenging environment
that degrades the quality of speech through the introduction of various types of noise and
band-limitations. Such economic and technological limitations have in large part
prevented voice command calling systems from being commercialized.In ELECTRICAL COMMUNICATION, vol. 59, no. 3, May 1985, Brussels BE,
pages 273-280, XP002013994, H. Mulla et. al.: "APPLICATION OF SPEECH
RECOGNITION AND SYNTHESIS TO PABX SERVICES" a PABX (private automatic
branch exchange) is described which comprises a speech recognition system for voice
dialling. Speaker-independent

<CLAIMS>
Toll call service center means accessible by subscribers to a toll call service via a toll
network (5), the subscribers (1, 4) each having a unique set of identifiers (13) uniquely

associated with a plurality of stations (2) predetermined to be accessible by the respective
subscriber, comprising:


storage means (16) for storing representations of said identifiers at storage locations
uniquely identified with the subscribers (1, 4) and for storing special identifiers, whereas

each special identifier is related to a subscriber;
announcing means (38);
processor means (30), responsive to reception of incoming calls from the subscribers, for
controlling the announcing means (38) and voice recognition means (14), the announcing

means (38) and the voice recognition means (14) provided for prompting a subscriber to
state his or her special identifier, carrying out a verification procedure with respect to an

entered spoken special identifier, upon verification of the entered spoken special identifier
prompting the subscriber to state one of his or her identifiers of his or her set of identifiers

(13) and determining whether the stated identifier is valid for the respective subscriber;

dialer means (24), operative under the control of the processor means (30) and responsive
to recognition of a valid identifier (1, 4), for dialing a telephone number of the station (2)

associated with the valid identifier for accessing this station (2) via the toll network (5);
verification means (50) for checking a spoken identification code entered by a subscriber

before the subscriber obtains access to his or her set of identifiers (13).
Method for running a toll call service center means accessible by subscribers to a toll
call service via a toll network (5), the subscribers (1, 4) each having a unique set of

identifiers (13) uniquely associated with a plurality of stations (2) predetermined to be
accessible by the respective subscriber, comprising the following steps: 


storing representations of said identifiers at storage locations uniquely identified with the
subscribers (1, 4) and storing special identifiers, whereas each special identifier is related to

a subscriber;
prompting a subscriber to speak his or her special identifier;
carrying out a verification procedure with respect to an entered spoken special identifier;
upon verification of the special identifier prompting the subscriber to speak one of his or

her identifiers of his or her set of identifiers (13);
determining whether the stated identifier is valid for the respective subscriber;
in case of a spoken valid identifier of the respective set of identifiers dialing a telephone
number of the station (2) associated with the valid identifier for accessing this station (2)

via the toll network (5);
checking a spoken identification code entered by a subscriber by means of verification
means (50) before the subscriber obtains access to his or her set of identifiers (13).
