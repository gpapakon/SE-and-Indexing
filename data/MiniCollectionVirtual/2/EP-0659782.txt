<ABSTRACT>
Applicants have discovered an improved photodefined dielectric 
materials comprising poly(aromatic diacetylenes). The preferred poly(aromatic 

diacetylenes) are copolymers of aromatic diacetylenes. Specific examples are 1) a 
copolymer of 4,4'-diethynyldiphenyl ether and 
m
-diethynyl benzene and 2) a 
copolymer of 4,4'-diethynyldiphenyl ether and 4,4'-bis(3-ethynylphenoxy)-2,2',3,3',5,5',6,6'-octafluorobiphenyl. 

These copolymers can be photochemically 
crosslinked in patterns with exposure of 30 mJ/cm²µm and 60 mJ/cm²µm, 

respectively, and patterns have been produced in 10 µm thick films with features as 
small as 12 µm.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to photodefinable dielectric layers for use in the 
fabrication of electronic circuits. There is a substantial need in the microelectronics industry for high 
quality, photodefinable dielectric materials. In many applications, such as in 
multichip modules, the dielectric polymer is ideally tough, resistant to 
thermoxidation, adherent and has good insulating capability. An ideal material 
exhibits low moisture absorption, a high dielectric constant and a low coefficient of 
thermal expansion. The material should be capable of low temperature processing, 
simple photodefinability and preferably be applicable from solution. Polyimides, the materials conventionally used, leave much to be desired. 
Polyimides typically require high curing temperatures on the order of 300°C and 
evolve water during curing. They have high moisture absorbance which makes their 
dielectric constant vary with humidity. Accordingly, there is a need for an improved 
material for making photodefinable layers. Applicants have discovered a improved photodefined dielectric 
materials comprising poly(aromatic diacetylenes). The preferred poly(aromatic 
diacetylenes) are copolymers of aromatic diacetylenes. Specific examples are 1) a 
copolymer of 4,4'-diethynyldiphenyl ether and m-diethynyl benzene and 2) a 
copolymer of 4,4'-diethynyldiphenyl ether and 4,4'-bis(3-ethynylphenoxy)-2,2',3,3',5,5',6,6'-octafluorobiphenyl. 
These copolymers can be photochemically 
crosslinked in patterns with exposure of 30 mJ/cm²µm and 60 mJ/cm²µm, 
respectively, and patterns have been produced in 10 µm thick films with features as 
small as 12 µm.  In the drawings: 
FIGs. 1A - 1F are a sequence of schematic cross sections illustrating the 
conventional use of photodefinable dielectrics in the fabrication of multichip 
modules; FIGs. 2A and 2B illustrate poly(aromatic diacetylenes) useful as 
improved photodefinable dielectrics; FIGs. 3A - 3D illustrate monomers useful in making the poly(aromatic 
diacetylenes) of FIGs. 2A and 2B. Referring to the drawings, FIGs. 1A through 1F are a sequence of 
schematic cross sections illustrating the conventional use of photodefinable 
dielectrics in the fabrication of multichip modules. These illustrations are useful in 
showing how the photodefinable dielectric of the invention can be used. As shown in FIG. 1A, the fabrication of a multichip module typically 
begins with provision of a substrate 10 such as a substrate of ceramic, polymer or 
silicon. The next step shown in FIG. 1B involves
