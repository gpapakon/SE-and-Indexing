<ABSTRACT>
This invention relates to the obtaining of a new 
natural mixture composed of higher primary aliphatic 

alcohols, where appropriate with an extended range from 
22 to 38 carbon atoms, especially those having between 24 

and 34 carbon atoms and more especially those with an 
unbranched chain of 24, 26, 28, 30, 32 and 34 carbon 

atoms. This mixture has a relative composition, with 
respect to each of the alcohols, which is highly reproducible 

from batch to batch, and is extracted from 
beeswax. 
The said natural mixture has been used efficaciously 
as an active principle of various pharmaceutical 

formulations, as anti-ulcer drugs and/or for the protection 
of the gastric and duodenal mucosa, and also as 

anti-inflammatories, both topically and orally or 
parenterally.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to the obtaining of a new 
natural mixture composed of higher primary aliphatic 
alcohols, where appropriate with an extended range from 
22 to 38 carbon atoms, especially those having between 24 
and 34 carbon atoms and more especially those with an 
unbranched chain of 24, 26, 28, 30, 32 and 34 carbon 
atoms. This natural mixture of alcohols has a relative 
composition, with respect to each of the alcohols, which 
is highly reproducible from batch to batch. The present invention relates essentially to the 
pharmaceutical industry, and especially to the development 
of pharmaceutical formulations with specific properties, 
since the formulations in question may be used 
against gastric and duodenal ulcers and also as anti-inflammatories. These formulations contain as active ingredient 
a new natural mixture composed of higher primary 
aliphatic alcohols with an unbranched chain of 24 to 34 
carbon atoms, especially ones with 24, 26, 28, 30, 32 and 
34 carbon atoms, which are obtained from beeswax 
(hereinafter designated M.H.A.A.B.W.). Medicinal products with specific pharmacological 
properties based on the use as active ingredient of these 
saturated higher primary aliphatic alcohols with an 
unbranched chain of 24 to 34 carbon atoms have not often 
been reported; only the case of the natural mixture 
obtained from sugar-cane waxes (EP-A-0,488,928) has been 
reported previously. The use of products produced by bees in empirical 
medicine has been known since before the present era. 
With the development of new methods of analysis, it has 
been possible to identify in many instances the active 
principle or principles present in the said products,  
 
which has enabled some of their biological and 
pharmacodynamic effects to be elucidated. Among bee-keeping 
products with therapeutic properties, royal 
jelly, honey, pollen and beeswax may be mentioned. The 
latter product is widely used in the pharmaceutical and 
cosmetics industry for its nutritive, cleansing and other 
medicinal properties, as well as for use in face packs. 
Beeswax is essentially composed of the following types of 
compound: 
saturated and unsaturated, long-chain hydrocarbons 
(55-75%) in a range from 21 to 37 carbon atoms, fatty esters (approximately 30%); these contain 
long-chain unbranched alcohols (between 16 and 30 
carbon atoms), free fatty acids (approximately 1-5%) in a range of 
between 16 and 30 carbon atoms, plus the 18:1 acid 
which constitutes 30% of this fraction, free long-chain alcohols
