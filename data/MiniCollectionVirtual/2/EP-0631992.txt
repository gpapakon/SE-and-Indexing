<ABSTRACT>
In the conditioning and homogenising of a glass stream (32) consisting of coloured glass, at least one cooling zone (K) and subsequently a homogenising zone are arranged in a pre-furnace between an inlet point and a removal point. In the pre-furnace, the glass temperature is lowered from an inlet temperature T1 to a removal temperature T2. For the purpose of intensifying the cooling action with simultaneous homogenising of the glass temperature, a maximum bath depth Tmax of 120 mm is set in the at least one cooling zone (K), at a throughput of at least 70 tonnes per day, by a sill-shaped raised part (23a) of the floor (23), which extends over the length of the cooling zone(s) (K). Furthermore, the cooling power is set in such a manner that, in the cooling zone (K), the temperature 20 mm above the floor is reduced by at least 40 DEG C. In the apparatus used, the raised part (23a) of the floor (23) extends over the entire length of the cooling zone(s) (K). The maximum depth Tmax of the flow channel is 120 mm above the raised part (23a) and the depth of the flow channel in the homogenising zone if at least 30 mm deeper.

continuously flowing glass flow (32) of coloured 

glass, in particular of brown glass or green glass, in 
a treatment section (16) disposed in a forehearth (13, 

14, 15) between an entry point (VE) and a removal 
point (E) and comprising at least one cooling zone (K; 

17, 18, 19) and a homogenising zone (H, 20, 21, 22)

base (23) extending over the length of the cooling 

zone(s) (K; 17, 18, 19), and that in the cooling zone
