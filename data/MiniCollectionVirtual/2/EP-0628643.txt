<ABSTRACT>
A process and apparatus for the manufacture of 
chemical vapor deposited materials such as silicon carbide 

which comprises conveying the reaction gases to a 
triangular chemical vapor deposition cell (12) where 

material is deposited by chemical vapor deposition. The 
triangular cell provides a large surface area for 

deposition while occupying a minimum amount of the furnace 
floor surface area. The triangular cell has the added 

benefit in that deposited structure (50) is of negligible 
thickness at the edges (48) thereby permitting easy 

separation of material with a minimum of post deposition 
machining.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to an improved method of and apparatus
for the manufacture of stiff, strong, lightweight structures, and
more particularly, to an improved method of and apparatus for the
manufacturing of silicon carbide and/or silicon lightweight
structures by the utilization of improved vapor deposition
techniques. Further, this invention relates to a triangular
chemical vapor deposition arrangement which can provide high yields
of thick ceramic materials or parts from a vapor deposition system.In the manufacture of ceramic materials by chemical vapor
deposition, gases are introduced into a hot furnace where they
react at the walls of the furnace or at the surface of a substrate
or mandrel positioned in the furnace to form a solid deposit or
coating thereon. Typically, a vacuum furnace designed in the shape
of a tubular cylinder having a circular cross section is used for
chemical vapor deposition. In the formation of a coating of a
ceramic material such as silicon carbide (hereinafter referred to
as "SiC"), methyltrichlorosilane (CH3SiCl3, for convenience termed
as "MTS" hereinafter), hydrogen (H2) and argon (Ar) gases are
introduced in the reaction chamber through stainless steel
injectors. Since MTS is a liquid at room temperature, Ar gas is
bubbled through the MTS and carries MTS vapor to the injectors.
Unreacted gases, products of reaction, and undeposited solids are
evacuated from the furnace and cleaned in a gas scrubber. Thick 
deposits (greater than 254 µm, 10 mils) of SiC can be manufactured using
this process. Typical conditions for the manufacture of SiC by
chemical vapor deposition are:
Substrate Temperature1350°C (2462°F)  Furnace or Reaction Chamber Pressure 26.7 kPa (200 torr) Partial Pressure of GasesAr16.7 kPa (125 torr)H28.0 kPa (60 torr)MTS2.0 kPa (15 torr)SiC parts are fabricated by the aforementioned process on a
mandrel which is placed perpendicular to the flow, i.e., an
impinging flow configuration. The reagents are introduced from
several injectors which impinge on the mandrel at different
locations and thus produce a more uniform deposit over the whole
mandrel area. Efficient recovery of the deposited material without
cracking or stressing is an important issue. In order to prevent
deposited material from cracking, the mandrel may be isolated from
the rest of the furnace using a gas shroud technique as disclosed
in Keeley et al., U.S. Patent No. 4,990,374; or a flexible body is
used to prevent backside growth on the mandrel as disclosed in
Goela et al., U.S. Patent No.
