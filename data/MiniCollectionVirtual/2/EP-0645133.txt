<ABSTRACT>
A bathtub for hydromassage, in particular for hydromassaging the back, is 
described. The bathtub comprises a series of nozzles 12 for delivering 

liquid under pressure, aligned longitudinally on the backrest 10 thereof 
in a substantially median position. Said nozzles 12 have associated with 

them control means for supplying them in succession with the liquid under 
pressure in one direction or in the opposite direction. This sequence is 

repeated cyclically for a predetermined period of time. The control 
means comprise a distributor which receives the liquid under pressure 

from a supply source and which is provided with a first substantially 
stationary member 20,34 and a second member substantially movable 24,52 

with respect to the first member. The second member is provided with at 
least one opening 28,56 designed to be positioned, as a result of 

displacement of the movable member 24,52, opposite openings of the fixed 
member 22,44 communicating in succession with the series of nozzles 12. 

In this way the liquid under pressure is allowed to flow into the latter, 
supplying of the nozzles 12 being performed in one direction or in the 

opposite direction according to the direction of displacement of said 
movable member 24,52.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to bathtubs for hydromassage in general and
more particularly to bathtubs provided with means for hydromassaging the
back.Hydromassage of the abovementioned type differs from that carried out. on
other parts of the body on account of the special way in which it is
achieved. In fact, whereas with hydromassage in general all the supply
vents or nozzles function simultaneously, in the case of hydromassaging
of the back the nozzles in question, which are aligned longitudinally in
at least one series along the backrest of the bathtub, must be activated
in a predetermined sequence. More precisely, they are supplied in
succession in one direction (from the bottom upwards) or in the opposite
direction. After the desired sequence has been chosen, it is repeated
cyclically for a predetermined period of time, depending on the effects
which are to be obtained.The nozzle activation cycle, as described here, can be explained in that
the action of this type of hydromassage reproduces the action of a
traditional manual massage performed by Shiatzu masseurs or
physiotherapists. It is sufficient to mention just one of the advantages
offered by this type of hydromassage, i.e. the significant reduction in
cost, to understand the huge success of bathtubs which can be used for
this purpose and the consequent research efforts by manufacturers to
achieve reliable and competitive technical solutions.Bathtubs which allow the user to undergo hydromassaging of the back are
in fact known and it is also known that generally they are provided with
suitable programming means for activating and supplying the vents or
nozzles delivering the liquid under pressure, as described above. These
programming means, which are for example of the electronic type in the
more sophisticated models of bath, control sequential opening and closing
of solenoid valves inserted in the supply ducts of the various nozzles.These tubs, however, while achieving satisfactory results in terms of
performance, are delicate and difficult to maintain, precisely on account 
of the frequently used components which are subject to wear. In fact,
these components operate in a damp environment and therefore require
frequent maintenance. From an economic point of view, therefore, they
are not convenient to use.Mention should also be made of the frequent interruptions in operation,
arising for the same reasons referred to above, which cause the user a
considerable amount of inconveniences.EP-A-0 154 935 discloses a kind of hydromassage device
</DESCRIPTION>
<CLAIMS>
A bath tub for hydromassage having a device for the hydromassage of the back of the user,
comprising at least one series of nozzles (12) for delivering a liquid under pressure, each

series of nozzles (12) being at least approximately parallel to the median axis of the backrest
wall (10) of the tub, and a distributor adapted to feed - according to a predetermined sequence

repeated cyclically for a predetermined period of time - the nozzles (12) with the liquid
delivered by a supply source (27), the said distributor comprising :


a first stationary member (20) which is connected to said source (27) and provided
with openings (22) suitable to allow the liquid under pressure to flow from the the source (27)

to the said nozzles (12) and
a second member (24) which is arranged inside the said first member (20) and
rotata
bly movable with respect to the same, the said second member being provided with a
plurality of holes (28), whereby the rotating movement of the second member (24) with respect

to the first member (20) causes the holes (28) provided in the second member to come into
and out of alignment with the openings (22) provided in the first member (20), 
characterized in
that
:

said distributor also comprises a duct or case (16) surrounding the said first member (20)
and a plurality of chambers (14) on which the nozzles (12) are mounted in communication

therewith,
and 
in that
 the arrangement of the holes (28) provided in the said second member (24) is
such that the rotation of the latter with respect to the said first member (20) causes the liquid

under pressure to be introduced in succession into the various chambers (14) when the same
holes (28) are aligned with the corresponding openings (22) provided in the first member (20)
