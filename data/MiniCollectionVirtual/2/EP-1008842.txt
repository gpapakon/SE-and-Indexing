<ABSTRACT>
The rinsing unit (12) is connected to the outlet pipe for the measured gas (5) by means of the inlet pipe for the rinsing agent (13) and to the removal sensor (1) by means of the inlet pipe for the rinsing agent (6). Apparatus for continuous removal of exhaust gases, particularly dust-containing hot gases comprises (a) a removal sensor (1) having an opening (3), outlet pipe for the measured gas (5), an inlet pipe for the rinsing agent (6), a water jacket (7) and flow barrier (8) for removal of particles; (b) protective cover (9); and a rinsing unit.

Apparatus for continuously drawing off waste gases, in particular for dusty hot gases, comprising

a) an off-take probe (1) with an orifice (3), a discharge line (5) for the test gas, a water jacket (7), at least one flow barrier (8) for particle precipitation,
b) a protective housing (9),
c) a purging unit (12) with a first supply line (6) and a second supply line (13) for the purging medium,
characterized in that
 the purging unit (12) is connected to the discharge line (5) for the test gas via the second supply line (13) for the purging medium, and to the off-take probe (1) via the first supply line (6) for the purging medium.
Apparatus according to Claim 1, 
characterized in that
 the diameter d
B
 of the discharge line (5) for the test gas lies in the range of 1.2 to 1.6 times the diameter d
E
 (4) of the orifice (3).
Apparatus according to Claim 1 or 2, 
characterized in that
 the input diameter D (10) of the protective housing (9) lies in the range of 15 to 20 times the diameter d
E
 (4) of the orifice (3) of the off-take probe (1).
Apparatus according to one of Claims 1 to 3, 
characterized in that
 the total length of the flow barriers (8) is at least 75% of the circumference,
 referred to the outside diameter d
A
 (2) of the off-take probe (1).
Apparatus according to one of Claims 1 to 4, 
characterized in that
 two flow barriers each of a length of approximately 50% of the annular gap (35) lying between the outer surface of the off-take probe (1) and inner surface of the protective housing (9) are arranged offset from one another along the longitudinal probe axis, the two surfaces completely covering the cross-sectional surface of the annular gap (35).
Apparatus according to Claim 5, 
characterized in that
 the first flow barrier (8) is withdrawn from the base of the protective housing (9) approximately by 1.2 times (L1) the protective housing diameter D, and the second flow barrier (8) is withdrawn from the base of the protective housing (9) approximately by 2.1 times (L2) the protective housing diameter D.
Apparatus according to one of Claims 1 to 6, 
characterized in that
 the flow barriers (8) are arranged as spacers between the protective housing (9) and off-take probe (1).
Apparatus according to one of Claims 1 to 7, 
characterized in that
 the protective housing (9) has a cooling water jacket (11).
Apparatus according to one of Claims 1 to 8, 
characterized in that
 the apparatus has control devices for applying continuous purging to the discharge line (5) for the test gas and pulsed purging to the off-take probe (1), this being done according to a prescribed timing cycle.
Method for continuously drawing off waste gases, in particular for dusty hot gases, in which the test gas is drawn off from an off-take probe (1) via a
 discharge line (5), in which the off-take probe (1) is fed a purging medium via a first supply line (6), while a purging medium is guided into the discharge line (5) for the test gas via a second supply line (13), in which the off-take probe (1) is cooled with the aid of a water jacket (7), and in which at least one flow barrier (8) is used to set the supply of the hot gas into the off-take probe (1) such that the supplied volume flow of the waste gas into the off-take probe (1) lies in a range of between 0.5 1/min to 5 1/min.
Method according to Claim 10, in which continuous purging is applied to the discharge line (5) for the test gas and pulsed purging is applied to the off-take probe (1), this being done according to permanently prescribed timing cycles.
Method according to Claim 10 or 11, in which the timing cycle for the purging with test gas lies in a range of 5 min to 15 min.
Method according to one of Claims 10 to 12, in which the time interval of the pulsed purging lies in a range of 0.5 min to 5 min.
Use of an apparatus according to one of Claims 1 to 9 or of a method according to one of Claims 10 to 13 for measuring the waste gas during metallurgical melting processes.
Use according to Claim 14 for waste gas measurements in an electric-arc furnace.
