<ABSTRACT>
A glycol-based deicer composition having ice adhesion repression properties is provided. Ice adhesion control derives from the presence of a film of the composition which is retained on the deiced surfaces and interferes with adhesion of new ice. The composition includes one or more anionic or nonionic surfactants selected to provide a spreading wetting value of 0 to about -5 degrees per centimeter.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to the use of water/glycol
compositions which have both deicing, anti-icing and
ice adhesion control properties when applied to
surfaces. More particularly, it relates to
compositions which can be applied to aircraft
surfaces to remove ice, snow and frost from the
surfaces and remain on the surfaces to provide
protection from ice, and/or snow build-up, yet be
readily removed from the surfaces by the shear
stresses generated during the takeoff of the
aircraft. Even if, under heavy precipitation and/or
during long waiting time, snow and/or ice accumulate
on the aircraft, a residual film of the fluid still
prevents the bonding of ice on the surface. This
allows an easy and quick redeicing, using a minimum
amount of deicing fluid in a minimum amount of time.Aircraft are subject to the buildup of ice,
frost and/or snow on their surfaces while the
aircraft are on the ground during cold weather in
the presence of relatively high humidity, rain
and/or snow. Ice and snow form strong bonds to
metal surfaces. Once a strong bond is formed
between ice and metal surfaces, it takes a
significant period of time and a high volume of
deicing fluid to melt the snow and ice and remove
them from the surface. Because the buildup of ice,
frost and/or snow on the aircraft surfaces can
adversely affect the functioning of the aircraft, 
such buildups should be removed from the airplane,
and aircraft surfaces must be free from
contamination before takeoff.Deicing solutions, such as those based upon
ethylene glycol and water, have been used for many
years to remove ice, frost and/or snow from aircraft
surfaces. These deicing compositions can
effectively remove the buildup of ice, frost and/or
snow from the surfaces, but since they have low
viscosities and have weak interfacial interactions
with aircraft surfaces, they do not form a film and
stay on the aircraft surfaces. Thus, they provide
limited protection against the formation of further
frost and ice or accumulation of snow on the
surfaces. Furthermore, conventional deicing fluids
do not decrease the bonding strength of ice on the
metal aircraft surfaces, once the snow and/or ice
build-up occurs. This makes the deicing a long and
high volume deicing fluid consumption process.Anti-icing fluids are those that will
prevent the formation of frost and ice or the
accumulation of snow on surfaces over extended
periods of time. The use of anti-icing fluids would
be particularly desirable for overnight frost
protection and for use during bad weather operation

Use of a composition comprising from 25 to
95 % by weight based on the weight of the

total composition of glycol selected from the group
consisting of ethylene glycol, diethylene glycol,

triethylene glycol, polyethylene glycol, propylene
glycol, dipropylene glycol, glycerol, and mixtures

thereof; a pH-adjusting agent in an amount sufficient
to provide a pH of 7 to 10; and at least one

nonionic or anionic surfactant, or mixtures thereof,
in an amount sufficient to cause the composition to

have a contact angle  on aluminum of 0 to 35°
and a surface tension δ of 15 to 40

dynes per centimeter, to provide a spreading wetting
value w of 0 to -5 dynes per centimeter in the

equation w = δ(cos  - 1); optionally, a corrosion inhibitor;
the remainder of the composition having no thickener and being

water

serves to remove ice, snow and frost from the surfaces and
remain on the surfaces to provide protection from ice, and/or

snow build-up, yet be readily removed from the surfaces by the
shear stresses generated during the takeoff of the aircraft.
The use of claim 1 wherein the glycol is

diethylene glycol, and mixtures thereof. 
The use of claim 2 wherein ethylene glycol and
diethylene glycol are present in a weight ratio to each other

anionic.
The use of claim 1 wherein the surfactant is a
mixture of anionic and nonionic surfactants.
The use of claim 4 wherein the surfactant is
selected from the group consisting of polyethylene glycol

ethers of molecular weight of 250 to 650, or mixtures
thereof.
The use of claim 1 wherein the corrosion
inhibitor comprises a composition comprising a phosphate

ester, an aromatic triazole and a chelating agent. 
A process for providing ice adhesion
repression on aircraft surfaces, comprising applying

to such surfaces a composition of claim 1, and
allowing such composition to coat such surfaces by

the action of spreading wetting, thereby providing on
such surfaces a thin film of such composition to

which ice does not adhere or adheres only weakly.
A process for deicing aircraft surfaces
comprising applying to such surfaces a composition of

claim 1, and subsequently providing an additional deicing
using a substantially lesser quantity of deicing

fluid than that needed for the initial deicing.
