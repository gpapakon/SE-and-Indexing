<ABSTRACT>
A process for preparing a glycolipid of formula (I): [(sac)m+n]-O-CH2-CHX-CH(OQ)-Y wherein Q is H or a blocking group; X is N3 or NH2; Y is a lipid residue; each sac is a saccharide; and m and n are each integers; comprises reacting a corresponding glycolipid of formula (II): (sac)n-O-CH2-CHX-CH(OQ)-Y with the corresponding saccharide (sac)m or a reactive derivative thereof, in the presence of an enzyme that catalyses the reaction. Compounds of formulae (I) and (II) are suitable for elaboration to a variety of saccharide ceramides.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to glycolipids and to their
preparation and use.Glycolipids are compounds of importance in therapy.
In particular, glycosphingolipids are naturally-occurring
compounds found in the membranes of all animal cells and in
some plant cells. One such compound is cytolipin H, a pure
lipid hapten, which has been isolated from human epidermoid
carcinoma extracts.Cytolipin H is N-lignoceroyl-1-sphingosyl lactoside.
This is a compound of formula I (see formulae below) when
Q is H, X is -NH-CO-C23H47, Y is -CH=CH-C13H27 and (sac)m+n is
a lactose residue. A synthesis of such compounds is
reported by Nicolaou etal, JACS (1988) 110:7910-7912, and
comprises coupling a protected di- or trisaccharide with a
protected sphingosine azide which is then elaborated.Yu etal, J. Biol. Chem. (1976) 251(1):198-203,
discloses that a sialyltransferase in mouse brain
microsomes catalyses the synthesis of sialosylgalactosylceramide
from added galactocerebroside and CMP-NANA.
The product, i.e. NeuNAc(α,2-3)gal(β,1-1)cer, and the
substrate, are compounds of formulae I and II in which X is
-NH-CO-C12H25 and Y is -CH=CH-C13H27. The enzymatic activity
is apparently dependent on the ceramide structure of the
glycolipids.Products of the ceramide type, i.e. containing two
hydrophobic residues, have serological activity that
depends on the nature of Y; see Graf etal, Chemistry and
Physics of Lipids (1974) 13:367-371.EP-A-0212400 discloses a chemical synthesis of
compounds of formula II wherein n=1, sac is glucopyranose,
X is -NH-CO-(C14-24 alkyl) and Y is -CH=CH-C13H27 or an
analogous group. Intermediates in this synthesis are of
the same structure except that X is N3 or NH2. The latter
is suitable for elaboration to a variety of groups X. WO-A-9116449 discloses the enzymatic coupling of one
or more saccharide units, i.e. a saccharide or a reactive
derivative thereof, to a preselected saccharide unit which
is previously attached to an acceptor moiety such as
glycolipid. The coupling utilises a glycosyl transferase. Zimmermann etal, J. Carbohydrate Chem. 7(2):435-452
(1988), disclose similar compounds, and also analogous
compounds wherein n=2. For example, in order to prepare
lactosylceramide, the per-O-acetylated trichloroacetimidate
of lactose is first coupled with a hydroxysphingosineazide;
the product is reduced and elaborated.The present invention is based on the discovery that
a glycolipid of the type obtained by coupling a saccharide
and a sphingosine, but not a ceramide, i.e. X is N3 or NH2,
is a satisfactory
