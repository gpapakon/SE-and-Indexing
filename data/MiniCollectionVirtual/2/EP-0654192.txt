<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates generally to radio communication
devices, and more specifically to radio communication devices
using time division multiplexing.Many modern communication systems use time division
multiplexing. Radios in such multiplexed systems switch rapidly
between the receive and transmit modes. Such radios may
include oscillators that provide reference waveforms for both the
receiver and transmitter portions of the radios. A problem may
arise in such radios when an oscillator in the radio produces a
signal having a frequency equal to the receive frequency, or to an
intermediate frequency of the receiver, because in many cases,
the oscillator cannot be turned off sufficiently fast to prevent its
output from being received by the receiver when the radio goes
into its receive mode. These oscillator signals interfere with the
performance of the radio because the receiver receives the
oscillator signals instead of desired signals. This phenomenon is
known as self-quieting, and is obviously undesirable. One
possible solution to the self-quieting problem is to shield the
receiver portion of the radio so that the oscillator signals are not
received during the receive mode. However, shielding of a
receiver requires space and may not be as effective as desired. The prior art includes United States patent numbers 4,903,257,
4,926,441 and 3,3,24,396. US patent number 4,903,257 discloses a
conventional transceiver which communicates with a remote transceiver
using a single frequency. This reference does not provide a solution to the
self quieting problem. US patent number 4,926,441 discloses a phase shift
keying transmitter. This reference does not address the problem of self-quieting
in a radio transceiver including both a transmitter and a receiver.
US patent number 3,324,396 discloses a transceiver that uses dividers to
avoid spurious signals and to further minimize the required number of
reference oscillators. Again, this reference fails to disclose a solution to the
problem of self quieting.Thus, a need exists for a method and apparatus for reducing self-quieting
that avoids the detriments of the prior art, including shielding.Briefly, according to a first aspect of the invention, a radio
communication device has a receive mode and a transmit mode and
includes a receiver for receiving signals having a selected frequency and a
transmitter for transmitting signals at the selected frequency. The receiver
includes means for converting received signals to at least one intermediate
frequency. The radio
