<ABSTRACT>
A method and apparatus are provided for creating a ladder 
program for a programmable controller by incorporating into 

the ladder program (52) a common ladder diagram (51) 
previously created and stored in a storage means (23). 

Means (5a, 7a) are provided for reading a device comparison 
table (53) from the storage means (23), which relates the 

first type device numbers (FD) used in the common ladder 
diagram (51) to second type device numbers used by the 

ladder program (52) to be created. In addition, editing 
means (6a) replace the first type device numbers (FD) with 

the corresponding second type device numbers obtained from 
the device comparison table (53), whereafter the edited 

common ladder diagram (51) is incorporated into the ladder 
program (52) to be created.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a process of 
programming a programmable controller (hereinafter referred 
to as a "PC"). In particular, the invention concerns a 
method and apparatus for writing a ladder diagram for display on a CRT 
screen. Figure 1 is a block diagram showing the conventional 
hardware configuration of a PC programming unit. In. 
Figure 1, a microprocessor 21 is connected by a bus 20 to 
a main storage device 22 comprising RAM, ROM, an 
auxiliary storage device 23 such as a hard disk or a floppy 
disk, a keyboard 24, acting as an input means, a display 
device 25, and a printer 26. Figure 2 is a block diagram illustrating the flow of 
processing and data during the writing of a ladder diagram 
in a conventional programming unit. Referring to Figure 2, 
the keyboard 24 is used to input data, which is temporarily 
stored in a keyed-in data buffer 12. The buffer 12 is 
connected to a ladder symbol data extraction processor 13 
for extracting a ladder symbol part from the input data in 
the keyed-in data buffer 12, and to a device name 
extraction processor 14 for fetching a device name from the  
 
input data in the keyed-in data buffer 12. An instruction 
code conversion processor 15 communicates with the ladder 
symbol data extraction processor 13 and converts the ladder 
symbol data into a PC instruction. Similarly, a device 
code conversion processor 16 communicates with the device 
name extraction processor 14 and converts device name data 
into an internal code. Both of the code conversion 
units 15 and 16 provide outputs to screen image table 
creation processor 17, which generates data for displaying 
the ladder diagram on the display device 25 in accordance 
with the data obtained in the code conversion process 
conducted by the units 15 and 16. A block position control 
processor 18 is operative to indicate the position on the 
display device 25 where the ladder diagram image is to be 
created, and is responsive to inputs of line and column 
data from code conversion unit 15. Information from screen 
image table creation processor 17 is used to update the 
information stored in processor 18. A screen display data 
converter 19 will convert screen image table data from 
processor 17 for display on the display device 25 and will 
control display of that data at specified locations on the 
screen of display device 25. Figure 3 illustrates a display screen 70 having a 
ladder area 71, along with ladder symbol and keyed-in data 
display area 72. For each of screens 70A-70F, there
