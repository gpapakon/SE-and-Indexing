<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method for the
quantitative determination of D-3-hydroxybutyric acid
and acetoacetic acid utilizing an enzymatic cycling
reaction. The present invention also relates to a
novel analytical reagent for use in the above-mentioned
quantitative determination.In clinical examination, it is important to determine
ketone bodies, such as D-3-hydroxybutyric acid and
acetoacetic acid, as criteria for detecting metabolic
failure. In addition to the above-mentioned two types
of ketone bodies, acetone can also be mentioned as a
ketone body. However, acetone is volatile and unstable.
In addition, the concentration of acetone in
blood is considerably low as compared to the concentrations
of D-3-hydroxybutyric acid and acetoacetic acid.
This means that a metabolic failure can be successfully
detected even by determining only D-3-hydroxybutyric
acid and acetoacetic acid among ketone bodies.Examples of conventional methods for the determination 
of ketone bodies include the diazonium method in
which acetoacetic acid is reacted with a diazonium salt
to thereby produce a hydrazo compound or an azo compound,
and the absorbance of the produced hydrazo or
azo compound is measured; the nitroprusside method in
which acetoacetic acid and acetone are reacted with a
nitroprusside reagent to thereby convert acetoacetic
acid and acetone to respective colorimetrically-detectable
forms; the gas chromatographic method in which
D-3-hydroxybutyric acid and acetoacetic acid are
converted to acetone and all of the ketone bodies are
quantitatively determined in terms of acetone by gas
chromatography; and the enzymatic method.Although the diazonium method exhibits high sensitivity,
the method requires deprotenization of a biological
sample before conducting the reaction of acetoacetic
acid with a diazonium salt. Further, for
determining D-3-hydroxybutyric acid by the diazonium
method, the following cumbersome operations are required.
Acetoacetic acid in a biological sample is
determined and then, D-3-hydroxybutyric acid in the
sample is converted to acetoacetic acid by 0-3-hydroxybutyrate
dehydrogenase, followed by measurement of the
acetoacetic acid (which is converted from the D-3-hydroxybutyric
acid), thus quantitatively determining 
both of the D-3-hydroxybutyric acid and acetoacetic
acid in the sample. Then, the quantity of D-3-hydroxybutyric
acid is obtained by subtracting the quantity of
acetoacetic acid from the above-mentioned total quantity
of D-3-hydroxybutyric acid and acetoacetic acid.
