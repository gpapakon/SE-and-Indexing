particle includes (i) 100 wt. parts of a binder resin
having a glass transition point (Tg) of 50 - 70 °C,

(ii) 0.2 - 20 wt. parts of solid wax, and (iii)
colorant particles or magnetic powder carrying a

liquid lubricant, so that the toner particle retains
at its surface the liquid lubricant gradually released

from the particles (iii). The toner may be further
blended with an organically treated inorganic fine

powder to provide a developer. The toner or
developer retains good lubricity and releasability so

that it is suitable to be used in an image forming
method including means contacting a latent image-bearing

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a toner and
a developer for developing electrostatic images used
in image forming methods, such as electrophotography,
electrostatic recording and magnetic recording, a
process for production thereof, and an image forming
method.Hitherto, a large number of electrophotographic
processes have been known, inclusive of those
disclosed in U.S. Patents Nos. 2,297,691; 3,666,363;
and 4,071,361. In these processes, in general, an
electrostatic latent image is formed on a
photosensitive member comprising a photoconductive
material by various means, then the latent image is
developed with a toner, and the resultant toner image
is, after being transferred onto a transfer material
such as paper, as desired, fixed by heating, pressing,
or heating and pressing, or with solvent vapor to
obtain a copy. The residual toner on the
photosensitive member without being transferred is
cleaned as desired by various methods, and then the
above steps are repeated.Accordingly, it has been required to provide 
a toner excellent in releasability, lubricity, and
transferability. For this reason, toners containing a
silicone compound have been disclosed in Japanese
Patent Publication (JP-B) 57-13868, Japanese Laid-Open
Patent Application (JP-A) 54-48245, JP-A 59-197048,
JP-A 2-3073, JP-A 3-63660, U.S. Patent No. 4,517,272,
etc. However, in such a toner containing a silicone
compound directly added thereto, a silicone compound
lacking mutual solubility with the binder resin shows
a poor dispersibility and cannot be uniformly
contained in individual toner particles, thus being
liable to result in a fluctuation in chargeability of
toner particles and a toner showing an inferior
developing performance in a continuous use.A corona discharger has been generally widely
used in a printer or a copying machine utilizing
electrophotography, as a means for uniformly charging
the surface of a photosensitive member (electrostatic
image-bearing member) or a means for transferring a
toner image on a photosensitive member. On the other
hand, a contact charging or transferring method of
causing a contact charging member to contact or be
pressed against a photosensitive member surface while
externally applying a voltage has been developed and
commercialized.Such a contact charging method or a contact
transfer method has been proposed in, e.g., JP-A 63-149669 
and JP-A 2-123385. In such a method, an
electroconductive elastic roller is abutted against an
electrostatic image-bearing member and is supplied
with a voltage to
