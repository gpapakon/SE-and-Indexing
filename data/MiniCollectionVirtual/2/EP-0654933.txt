<ABSTRACT>
A document handling system particularly suitable for electronic 
imaging by sequentially feeding uppermost document sheets (18) stacked 

in an input 
tray (20) to be imaged in forward serial order at an imaging station (16) 

and restacked 
collated in an output tray (22), with a short and compact "U" shaped 

common 
document feeding path  also providing the majority of a duplex 

document 
feeding path (24) for returning duplex document sheets imaged on 

their first sides 
back to the imaging station for imaging their second sides. 

The input and output 
trays are in a space saving closely superposed relationship 

defining a protective 
confining inverter chute space therebetween within which the 

duplex document 
sheets may be fed out over the output tray by a dual mode 

reversible output 
sheet feeder at the "U" shaped path output and then reversed 

to feed back 
through a short linear duplex document feeding path into the 

entrance of the 
same "U" shaped document sheet feeding path for simplex document 

sheets to 
provide a duplex loop path.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a document handler according to the preamble of claim 1, being adapted
for feeding and imaging sets of duplex (as well as simplex)
document sheets.A system according to the preamble of claim 1 is known from
US 4 066 252.Similar document handler, which however, use a single tray both
as input tray and as output tray are known from JP-A-58
040 971 and US 5 203 554.Another document handler having an inverter loop branched off at the
document input path is known from US 5 201 505.EP-A-0 639 917 (prior art according to Art 54(3) EPC) shows
a document handler which has an inverter loop including a
switch back path rather than a dual mode reversible output sheet feeder
capable of feeding a sheet out over the output tray. By way of background, on the general subject of a duplex automatic
document handler (DADF) with a stacking input tray at least partially overlying a
stacking output tray and the platen, but for a light-lens copier, there is noted the
Xerox Corporation "5034" copier document handler, and illustrative Xerox Corp.
patents thereon such as 5,000,438 or 5,001,124. However it may be seen that this
is disadvantageously an N to 1 system, with a bottom feeder, and the document
path is longer and more complex, including feeding, stopping and refeeding the
documents across a full width platen to the end of the output tray which is
opposite from the input end of the input tray. Another DADF is disclosed in
Xerox Corp. U.S. 4,941,023, and other art is noted therein on DADF's and their
coordination with trayless duplex copy sheet loops.Further by way of background, it is known that a CVT (constant velocity
transport or moving document) scanner can provide rapid (and more closely
spaced) document exchange times at the imaging station, to help, e.g., provide
scanning at greater than 50 scanned documents per minute. Xerox Corporation
has made CVT [slit scan] type document handlers for copiers with otherwise
normal large stationary document moving optics platens, such the Xerox
Corporation "3100 LDC" [see, e.g., U.S. 4,017,172 issued April 12, 1977 to Thomas
Lynch]; and even earlier CVT only large document or engineering drawing
copiers. A recent example of a Xerox Corporation commercial large document
copier with a dual nip and dual speed reversible CVT is disclosed in U.S. 4,996,556
(D/89229) issued Feb.26, 1991 to G.A. Grey, Jr.There is extensive art on two tray simplex or duplex document feeders for
light-lens copiers in which the documents are fed by a constant velocity transport
