<ABSTRACT>
A method and apparatus for concurrent communication of analog information and 
digital information. In general terms, when the communication channel is viewed as a 

multi-dimensional space, the digital information signal is divided into symbols, and the 
symbols are mapped onto the signal space with a preset distance between them. The 

analog signal, generally limited in magnitude to less than the distance separating the 
symbols, is converted to component signals and added (i.e., vector addition) to the 

symbols. The sum signal is then transmitted to the receiver where the symbols are 
detected and subtracted from the received signal to yield the analog signal components. 

The transmitted analog signal is recreated from those components. Both half-duplex and 
full-duplex operation is available in accordance with this invention.

<DESCRIPTION>
This application is related to an application titled SIMULTANEOUS ANALOG AND DIGITAL COMMUNICATION, filed on even date hereof.This invention relates to simultaneous transmission of analog and digital signals and, more particularly, to simultaneous transmission of analog signals and digital signals in a non-multiplexed manner and in a generally co-extensive frequency band.In the prior art, when voice and data is transmitted simultaneously over a channel, it is typically transmitted either via frequency-division multiplexing or time-division multiplexing. In frequency-division multiplexing, the data channel and the voice channel are allocated different sub-bands of the channel's bandwidth. Examples of that are U.S. Patent No. 4,757,495, U. S. Patent 4,672,602, and U. S. Patent 4,546,212. In time-division multiplexing arrangements, voice signals are sampled, digitized and interleaved with digital data to form a single information stream which is communicated over the available channel. Practically every digital carrier system (e.g. the T1 carrier system) is an example of that.U.S. Patent No. 4,512,013, issued April 16, 1985, presents an interesting approach that is close to a frequency division multiplexing arrangement for simultaneous voice and data. The arrangement filters the speech signal and adds thereto a modulated narrowband signal to form the transmitted signal. The narrowband modulated signal derives from a narrowband digital input signal that is modulated with a carrier, thereby shifting the narrow-band up in frequency to a position in the spectrum where there is little speech energy. At the receiver, in reliance of the fact that the speech power is low in the narrowband occupied by the modulated digital signal, the digital signal is recovered through appropriate demodulation. Thereafter, the recovered digital signal is remodulated to replicate the transmitter's operation, adaptively filtered to account for channel characteristics, and subtracted from the received signal. The result is the received speech. As indicated above, one salient characteristic of that arrangement, as stated in col. 2, lines 13-18, is that "...an entire analog speech signal and a modulated data signal are capable of being transmitted over a normal analog channel by the multiplexing of the data signal within the portion of the normal analog speech signal frequency band where the speech signal is present and the power density characteristic thereof is low". As an aside, the 4,517,013 arrangement is half duplex.In the modem
