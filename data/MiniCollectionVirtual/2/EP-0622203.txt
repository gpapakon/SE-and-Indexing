<ABSTRACT>
To prevent rubbing of the printing mechanism against still wet ink on a buckled 

or curled sheet of an absorbent print medium after an inkjet printer has printed one 
swath of a high density image, printing of the next swath (404) is delayed as a 

function of the maximum density of the ink drops deposited on the print medium for 
the printed swath(s). The required delay (416) in printing the next swath is dependent 

on print mode and preferably uses a formula with empirically derived constants to 
allow sufficient time for the solvent in the ink to evaporate or otherwise disperse and to 

permit any buckling or curling of the print medium to stabilize. In one preferred 
embodiment, a maximum density is calculated by counting drops of ink in each of 

several overlapping grids, and the magnitude and location of the maximum density 
grid on a prior page is also used to limit the throughput of a next page until a 

sufficient delay has elapsed to ensure that ink on the prior page will not be smeared 
when it comes into contact with the next page.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates in general to inkjet printers and in
particular to printing high quality images having densely inked areas without
smearing the print media.The following commonly assigned U.S. patent application filed
concurrently herewith claims an invention which, although believed to be
patentably distinguishable, has objectives and which is based on principles
that are closely related to those of the present invention:
J.R. Arbeiter et al, "Adaptive Control of Second Page Printing to
Reduce Smear in an Inkjet Printer"
(European Patent Publication No.0622204).Inkjet printers operate by sweeping a pen with one or more inkjet
nozzles above a print medium and applying a precision quantity of liquid ink
from specified nozzles as they pass over specified pixel locations on the
print medium. In EP-A-0 423 820 there is disclosed an ink jet
printer having a sheet conveying mechanism which changes the
speed of conveyance of a recording sheet in accordance with
the density of characters or a pattern to be printed. The
recording sheet is conveyed in such a manner that all
printed portions are properly dried before the sheet is
conveyed to a subsequent position. The recording head of
the printer performs a printing operation while pushing the
front end portion of the recording sheet against the platen
with a sheet retaining lever.When a number of pixels in a particular area of an absorbent print
medium such as bond paper absorb the liquid solvent constituent (typically
water) of the ink, the paper fibers in that area will expand until the solvent
has evaporated or otherwise dispersed. Because the dampened area of the
print medium is typically constrained in the plane of the paper by adjacent
less damp areas and/or by the paper advance mechanism and from below
by a platen, the dampened area has a tendency to buckle upwards towards
the nozzle (a problem referred to as "cockle"). If the height of the buckle
exceeds the nominal spacing between the pen and the paper, then the ink
in that area will be scraped by the pen as the pen retraces over some or all
of the buckled area during a subsequent sweep over the same in the
opposite direction (bidirectional and certain color printing modes) or prior to
printing a sweep over an overlapping area (multiple pass printing modes).
Such scraping causes smearing of the still damp ink and a degradation of
image quality.A related problem is "curling" of the paper. As a result of the
differential absorption of solvent on the two sides of the paper, once the
paper

<CLAIMS>
An inkjet printer (100) for printing an image on a
sheet of print media (101), comprising a carriage supporting

an inkjet print head (103) for applying liquid ink to said
sheet under said print head (103) as successive columns of

dots contained within each of a plurality of horizontal
swaths to thereby print a plurality of respective horizontal

portions of said image, a carriage drive mechanism to move
said carriage horizontally relative to said sheet (101) to

thereby sweep said print head across a horizontal swath to
thereby print a horizontal portion of said image within said

horizontal swath, a sheet feeding mechanism (106,107)
independent of said carriage drive mechanism to move said

sheet vertically relative to said carriage to thereby print
a first said horizontal portion of said image within a first

said horizontal swath and then a second said horizontal
portion of said image within a second said horizontal swath

vertically displaced from said first horizontal swath, and
a controller (120) for inhibiting (433) said carriage drive

mechanism (122) from moving said print head (103,123)
horizontally over said first horizontal swath after said

first horizontal portion has been printed until a first
delay (431,432) has elapsed following the printing of said

first horizontal portion, wherein said first delay is
determined by said controller from how much of said ink is

applied in at least one predetermined area of said first
horizontal swath (304), whereby any localised dampening o
f
the sheet within said predtermined area will have dissipated

to a point where any remaining cockle will not cause the
sheet to come into contact with the print head when the

print head makes a second pass over said predetermined area.
A printer as in claim 1, wherein the controller (120)
comprises means (303) for counting how many dots of said

dots of ink are applied in a plurality of different
predetermined areas of said first horizontal swath, and said

first delay is based (308) on a maximum value of the number 
of said dots in any one of said areas.
A printer as in claim 2, wherein said predetermined
areas are defined by a plurality of horizontally overlapping

grids (G(1,1), G(1,2)) within the first horizontal
swath, each of said grids having a length equal to a first

number of columns of said dots and a width equal to a second
number of rows of said dots.
A printer as in claim 3, wherein a first set of said
horizontally overlapping grids (G(1,x)) vertically

overlaps a second set of said horizontally overlapping grids
(G(2,x)).
A printer as in claim 2, wherein said controller
comprises means for using said maximum value (308)

to retrieve a corresponding delay factor from a stored table
(126).
A printer as in claim 2, wherein said controller (120)
comprises a calculator (128), which calculates said first

delay from a delay factor equal to the sum of a first
coefficient times a first maximum value representing a

density of a first type of ink plus a second coefficient
times a second maximum value representing a density of a

second type of ink.
A printer as in claim 6, wherein the first type of ink
is black ink and the second type of ink is colored ink.
A printer as in claim 6, wherein between a
predetermined minimum (Smin) and a predetermined maximum

(100%), said delay factor is given by the formula

Sc - {K1*BDen + K2*CDen}

where

Sc, K1 and K2 are constants,
BDen is said first maximum value, and
CDen is said second maximum value.
A printer as in claim 8, wherein at least the
predetermined minimum delay factor (Smin) is dependent on

print mode.
A printer as in claim 9, wherein said print mode is a
multiple pass print mode in which the carriage (122) makes

multiple sweeps across each horizontal swath, and said
maximum value is a maximum value for a single sweep.
A printer as in claim 2, wherein said calculator (128)
calculates the first delay (432) in

accordance with the formula:

{nominal_advance_time_}/{delay_factor}

where

nominal_advance_time is a predetermined minimum time between
the printing of subsequent said swaths, and
delay_factor is a predetermined linear function of said
maximum value.
A printer as in claim 11, wherein said delay factor
is not more than 100% and not less than 0.
