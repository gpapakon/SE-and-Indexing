<ABSTRACT>
A multiple exercice unit (10) capable of providing a user with a wide range of strength and conditioning exercises. The exercice unit (10) provides resistance through an isokinetic device (20) such as a centrifugal brake which utilizes a clutch mechanism. Lines (22, 24) extend out of the isokinetic device and attach to various exercice elements (26, 30) such that a variety of upper and lower body strength exercices may be performed.

<DESCRIPTION>
 MULTI-EXERCISE APPARATUSField of the InventionThe present invention relates to a multi exercise unit which encompasses both upper and lower body training exercises. The unit is designed for home use and provides a wide array of different exercises. The unit has a resistance mechanism which provides resistance for upper and lower body exercises.Background of the Invention The prior art shows various types of exercising devices that use cables, pulleys, elastic mechanisms, free weights and other loading devices. The devices may be used for bench presses, lat pulls, butterfly reps, arm and leg curls, sguats, leg extensions as well as other exercises.U.S. Re-examination Patent No. 4,072,309 discloses a multi-purpose exercise device. The device provides for a variety of exercises using spring means such as shock cords to provide resistance. As the user moves a lever arm, the spring means resists the movement. However, this device has the drawback of an uneven force applied throughout the stroke. The uneven force results from the mechanics of a spring which applies little resistive force when stretched a short way, but applies an extremely high resistive force when stretched close to its maximum. Furthermore, these types of resistance devices can also be unsafe in that if the user loss his/her grip, the lever arm snaps guickly back into place, possibly injuring the user. Another disadvantage of this exercise unit is the angular displacement that the bench press/squat bar travels during the stroke. The pivot point of the bar is on the vertical member. As the bar is moved upward, it reduces the resultant angle between the bar and the vertical member, until at its maximum the bar touches the vertical member. This is not the desirable travel path a bar moves in a bench press or squat exercise. 

 Other exercise devices utilize free weights which are lifted with cables. Examples of this technology- include U.S. Patent No. 4,678,185. However, these devices often result in injuries on the eccentric or down stroke of the lever arm. This is due to the fact that most weight lifting injuries occur after the user has forced the resistance mechanism to a maximum. The user is lowering the resistive force by returning the lever or pivot arm to its resting position and injuries tend to occur during this motion. Thus, it is preferred not to have any resistance on this eccentric portion of the exercise repetition.Other resistance devices include isotonic devices which utilize a cam in conjunction with a stack of weights.

WHAT IS CLAIMED IS:
1. An exercise apparatus comprising:
(a) a positionable bench;
(b) a horizontal member extending below said bench;
(c) a vertical member extending upwardly from a first end of said horizontal member;
(d) a loading device operable to apply a drag on a moveable element forming part of the loading device, said loading device situated on said horizontal or vertical member, said loading device comprising a rotatable centrifugal force sensitive force generating brake member that provides a resistive force proportional to the speed of rotation of the rotatable member; and
(e) an exercise operable, element connected to said loading device by a flexible line means, said exercise operable element being mounted such that upon movement of said exercise element, said line means is pulled away from said loading device, said moveable element of said loading device is moved and said line means is loaded.
2. The exercise apparatus of claim 1 wherein said exercise operable element is configured so it is suitable for grasping and displacing in a vertical direction, said exercise element extending over said bench and comprising a slidable carriage, said carriage having said line means secured thereto, said carriage configured such that it slides in an essentially vertical plane on said vertical member.
3. The exercise apparatus of claim 2 wherein said resistance force is adjusted by extending the length of said line means outside of said loading device through at least one pulley located on said carriage. 


 4. The exercise apparatus of claim 2 wherein said carriage has at least two roller bearings and at least two caster wheels, said bearings and wheels suitable for operational movement of said carriage on said vertical member.
5. The exercise apparatus of claim 1 wherein said exercise element comprises a butterfly configuration, said butterfly configuration being secured to said vertical member and comprising two arms extending in a horizontal plane away from said vertical member, said arms moveable in an arcuate manner about at least one pivot point.
6. The exercise apparatus of claim 5 wherein said resistance force is adjusted by extending the length of said line means through at least one pulley located on said butterfly configuration.
7. The exercise apparatus of claim 1 wherein said line means is wound around a loading pulley on the loading device, said loading pulley being drivably connected to the rotatable force generating member through a one-way clutch means.
8. The exercise apparatus of claim 3 having a second pulley positioned closer to said horizontal member, a third pulley positioned in proximity to said first pulley, all pulleys being of size to guide said line means, whereby said line means is guidable out of said loading device around said first pulley, back toward said horizontal member, and then guided by said second pulley upwardly to said third pulley such that said line means may be guided around said third pulley and thereafter said line means secured to a pin means on said carriage. 


 9. The exercise apparatus of claim 1 wherein said exercise element comprises a bar configured so as to provide resistance force about an axis perpendicular to said bench, said exercise element positioned at a second end of said horizontal member.
