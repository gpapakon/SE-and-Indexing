<ABSTRACT>
A nerve stimulation apparatus includes a waveform 
generator (14) capable of generating a waveform comprising 

a sequence of pulses (20), and a controller (12). The 
pulses (20) have parameters as follows, a repetition rate 

of 150 to 200 Hz, a pulse width of 0,8 to 1,2 ms, a pulse 
decay which is exponential, an amplitude of between 40 to 

60 volts with a negative DC off-set, and an output current 
of 0,01 to 10 mA. The controller (12) controllably varies 

the parameters of the pulse generator. A method of 
controlling pain in a human subject includes applying the 

waveform to the human subject.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a nerve stimulation apparatus. It 
relates in particular to a nerve stimulatiton apparatus for 
controlling pain in a human subject. EP-290126 describes a low frequency curing apparatus which 
is directly applied to the skin to assist in healing. GB-A-2099705 describes a pain blocking generator which has 
a pulse generator. The pulse generator causes pulses to be 
applied to a patient. According to the invention there is provided a nerve 
stimulation apparatus which includes a waveform generator for 
generating a waveform comprising a sequence of pulses which are 
operatively fed to a first output terminal and a second output 
terminal of the apparatus, characterized in that the waveform 
generator comprises current regulating means connected to the 
first output terminal and operable to regulate an output current 
of the waveform generator, and a voltage source connected to the 
second output terminal so that a load connectable to the first 
and second output terminals provides a series connection between 
the current regulating means and the voltage source, said 
apparatus further being characterized in that a controller is 
provided, said controller being connected to the 
waveform generator said controller being 
operable to control the current regulating means and the voltage 
source so that the pulses generated by the waveform generator 
have a repetition rate of 150 to 200Hz, a pulse width of 0,8 to 
1,2 ms, an amplitude of between 40 and 60 Volts with a negative 
DC offset, and an output current of 0,01 to 10 mA, the 
wave form generator being arranged so that the pulses each have 
an exponential decay. The voltage source may have voltage off-set means 
operable to adjust the negative DC off-set of the waveform 
so that each pulse has a positive peak of 10 to 600 mV. The controller may include signal generating means 
for generating a current control signal, the current 
regulating means being responsive to the current control  
 
signal thereby to vary the output current from the waveform 
generator. The voltage source may include a switching circuit 
which comprises 
a high frequency oscillator for generating a high 
frequency output signal; a coil connected to an output of the high frequency 
oscillator and to which the high frequency output signal is 
applied in use; and rectifier means connected to the coil and arranged to 
rectify the high frequency output signal to provide a 
rectified output voltage at an output of the voltage source. The voltage source may
