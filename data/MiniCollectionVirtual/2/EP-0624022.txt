<ABSTRACT>
The time stage modules (TSCI, TSCO) are fitted out in such a way that they can also act as test pattern generators or test pattern receivers. The same applies to the space switching stage modules (R1, R2, R3) with regard to test pattern transmission. Furthermore, a time stage module (TSC-E; TSC-S), designed solely as a test pattern generator or receiver, is provided at a central point. A flexible testing system is achieved in conjunction with a test bus (TBi, TBo) and feed-in and coupling-out points.

An arrangement for voice path testing for use in a switching
network of a digital time division multiplex telephone switching

centre, containing time switching stage units or combined time/space
switching stage units and space switching stage units, with a test

facility which enables test patterns to be supplied to the
respective switching stage units of the aforementioned switching

network and enables the test patterns routed by way of the switching
stage units in question to be received and evaluated,
characterised in that

the test facility contains a test pattern generator which is formed
by means of one of the time switching stages or time/space switching

stage units (TSCI, TSCO, R1, R2, R3) of the aforementioned switching
matrix that can be used as an alternative to call processing mode in

a test operational mode in conjunction with a test sender register
(RDTI), and contains a test pattern receiver which is formed by

means of one of the time switching stage units or time/space
switching stage units (TSCI, TSCO) of the switching matrix in

question that can be used as an alternative to call processing mode
in a test operational mode in conjunction with a test receive

register (RDTU),

that the test facility comprises a separate time, time/space or
space switching stage unit (TSC-S, SSM-S) which is contained in an

associated switching group controller and takes the form of a
further test pattern generator, and also comprises a separate time

or time/space switching stage unit (TSC-E) which is likewise
contained in the aforementioned associated switching group

controller and takes the form of a further test pattern receiver,

and that the arrangement comprises at least one test pattern input
point assigned to the switching network and at least one test

pattern output point assigned to the switching network and a test
bus (TBi, TBo) by way of which the test pattern input and output

points are accessible from the switching group controller.
The arrangement according to Claim 1, 
characterised in that
 in
addition to the test sender register (RADR) for supplying a desired 

test pattern a test control register (RDTI) for supplying a write
control address in each case for an information memory (SM) of the

switching stage unit in question is assigned to the time switching
stages or the combined time/space switching stage units,

that the test pattern contained in the test sender register (RADR)
can be written into the relevant information memory (SM) instead of

telephone information delivered on multiplex lines (ME1 to ME4) for
the incoming transmission direction under random control by the

write control addresses contained in the test control register
(RDTI) instead of a cyclical control by a counter and can then be

read out as in call processing mode randomly under the control of a
control memory (CM),

and that the information memory (SM) can be operated in a switching
stage unit serving as a test pattern receiver in such a way that a

test pattern can be written in it as in call processing mode under
cyclical control and that its memory contents can be read out at

random whilst further write operations are suppressed and under the
control of an access address located in the associated test control

register (RDTI) instead of an access address supplied by the control
memory (CM), but to a test receive register (RDTU) instead of to a

multiplex line for the outgoing transmission direction (MA1 to MA4),
from where a comparison can be performed with the written test

pattern.
The arrangement according to Claim 2, 
characterised in that
 a
test input register for the storage of a number of test pattern bits

equal to the number of switching stage inputs in input-specific
register locations is assigned to the respective space switching

unit utilized as a test pattern generator,

and that the control memory present in the space switching stage
unit in question serves as an access address memory into which can

be written, instead of the through-connection addresses used for
call processing, access addresses which result in a through-connection

of test pattern bits such that groups of outputs of the
space switching stage units supplying successive bits having the

same binary value are defined in each case.
