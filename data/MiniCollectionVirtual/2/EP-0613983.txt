<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to an excavator (1) for specifically picking up material by suction, in particular for excavating earth at buried lines. The excavator (1) has a pneumatic suction pipe (3) for picking up the material. The suction pipe (3) opens out in a collecting tank (2) for the sucked-up material. A suction fan (4) is attached to the collecting tank (2). In the collecting tank (2), the material is separated from the suction-air flow and is then passed through a filter device (6) arranged between the opening of the suction pipe (3) and the suction fan (4). In order to ensure effective separation by the filter device (6) for as long a time as possible, the filter device (6) is formed by a coarse filter (6a) and an adjoining fine filter (6b), the coarse filter (6a) being formed by a labyrinth- or cascade-shaped flow passage which is defined by dividing walls (7a) offset from one another and whose cross-section of flow increases in the direction of flow. A conveyor device (23) can be provided at the base of the collecting tank (2). The material separated from the air flow can be discharged continuously or at intervals from the collecting tank (2) by means of the conveyor device (23).

Dredge for the planned taking up of suction material, particularly for 
digging out soil on underground lines having a pneumatic suction tube (3) 

for taking up the suction material, the storage tank (2) for the sucked up 
material, into which issues the suction tube (3) and in which the suction 

material is separated from the suction air flow, an exhaust fan (4) connected 
to the storage tank (2) and a filtering mechanism (6), incorporating a fine 

filter (6b), located between the opening of the suction tube (3) in the 
storage tank (2) and the exhaust fan (4), characterized in that upstream of 

the fine filter (6b) is positioned a coarse filter (6a) formed by a labyrinth-like 
flow channel (8, 9, 10), in which the suction air flow is strongly 

multiply deflected, in which the flow channel (8, 9, 10) is bounded by mutually 
offset partitions (7a, 7b, 7c), which are positioned with different 

spacings in such a way that the flow cross-section of the flow channel 
increases in the flow direction. 
Dredge according to claim 1, characterized in that the partitions (7a, 
7b, 7c) are arranged substantially vertically and parallel to one another. 
Dredge according to claim 1 or 2, characterized in that the deflections of 
the flow channel (8, 9, 10) alternately occur close to the upper wall (2a) 

and close to the bottom (2b) of the storage tank (2). 
Dredge according to one of the claims 1 to 3, characterized in that the 
fine filter (6b) is formed by several flowed-through filtering bags (16). 
Dredge according to claim 4, characterized in that the filtering bags 
(16) are substantially vertically oriented and the flow therethrough is from 

bottom to top. 
Dredge according to claim 4 or 5, characterized in that at the upper end 
the filtering bags (16) are provided with air and/or water nozzles (17) by 

means of which the filtering bag (16) can be blown or rinsed out under 
pressure. 
Dredge according to one of the claims 4 to 6, characterized in that the 
filtering bags (16) are fitted to a support frame (15) mounted in floating 

manner.  
 
Dredge according to claim 7, characterized in that the support frame (15) 
is vibrated by means of a vibrating mechanism (18, 19). 
Dredge according to one of the claims 1 to 8, characterized in that on 
the bottom (2b) of the storage tank (2) is provided a conveying mechanism 

(23) by means of which the suction material separated from the air flow can 
be removed from the storage tank. 
Dredge according to claim 9, characterized in that the conveying mechanism 
is a screw conveyor (23). 
Dredge according to claim 10, characterized in that the screw conveyor 
(23) runs substantially in the longitudinal direction of the dredge. 
Dredge according to claim 10 or 11, characterized in that with the feed-side 
end of the screw conveyor (23) is associated an opening (24) in the 

bottom (2b) of the storage tank (2) through which the suction material drops 
onto a transporting mechanism (26) located below the same. 
Dredge according to claim 12, characterized in that the opening (24) is 
close to the rear end of the storage tank (2). 
Dredge according to claim 12 or 15, characterized in that the transporting 
mechanism incorporates a first conveyor belt (26). 
Dredge according to claim 14, characterized in that at the free end of 
the first conveyor belt (26) is located a second conveyor belt (27), the 

suction or feed material being transferable from the first conveyor belt 
(26) to the second conveyor belt (27). 
Dredge according to claim 15, characterized in that the second conveyor 
belt (27) is fitted in pivotable manner to the chassis of the dredge (1) 

and/or is displaceable relative to the chassis. 
Dredge according to one of the claims 1 to 16, characterized in that a 
settli
ng chamber (2c) is positioned upstream of the filtering mechanism (6)  
 

in the storage tank (2). 
Dredge according to claim 17, characterized in that the settling chamber 
(2c) is subdivided by a partition (28) into two tank portions (31, 32) and 

that flow guidance devices (30) are provided by means of which the suction 
air flow entering the storage tank (2) through the opening of the suction 

tube (3) can be passed into one or other of the two tank portions (31, 32). 
Dredge according to claim 18, characterized in that at its lower end 
each tank portion (31, 32) has a sealable opening (34) through which the 

separated suction material drops onto an underlying transporting mechanism 
(34). 
Dredge according to claim 19, characterized in that the transporting 
mechanism is a conveyor belt (35). 
Dredge according to claim 20, characterized in that the conveyor belt 
(35) is pivotably fitted to the chassis of the dredge (1) and/or is displaceable 

relative to the chassis.
