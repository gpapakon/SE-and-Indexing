<ABSTRACT>
The preformed piece (V) after the first pressing is transferred without additional compression into an intermediate position, from which it is fed to a second press process. A bush (3) is provided which has an ID (3a) corresp. to the OD of the preformed piece and which is movable between a receiving position located behind the press tool and a transfer position in front of the forming tool (4) displaced to the press tool (1). A second press thruster (6) working in conjunction with the bush (3) in the transfer position has a dia. which approximately corresponds to the outlet dia. (4b) of the form tool (4).
