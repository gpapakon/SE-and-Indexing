<ABSTRACT>
A process for removal of solid organic matters 
formed and deposited in the reaction system when an 

unsaturated aldehyde or an unsaturated aldehyde-containing 
gas is subjected to catalytic gaseous oxidation in 

the presence of an oxidizing catalyst to prepare an 
unsaturated carboxylic acid corresponding thereto, which 

process comprises contacting the solid organic matters 
with a mixed gas containing at least 3 volume % of molecular 

oxygen and at least 0.1 volume % of steam at a 
temperature of 260 to 450°C.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a process for safe 
and efficient removal of solid organic matters formed and 
deposited in instruments such as the piping and the 
reactor in the reaction system or on the oxidizing catalyst 
layer in the catalytic gaseous oxidation reaction of 
an unsaturated aldehyde or an unsaturated aldehyde-containing 
gas. Further, this invention relates to a process 
for efficient regeneration of an oxidizing catalyst 
whose catalytic activity was lowered by reduction caused 
by performance of oxidation reaction over a long term, 
without causing any damage due to its complete oxidation. Many proposals have hitherto been made on a 
process for preparation of an unsaturated carboxylic acid 
from a corresponding unsaturated aldehyde or a corresponding 
unsaturated aldehyde-containing gas by catalytic 
gaseous oxidation reaction. For example, there can be 
mentioned GB-A-1 106 648, GB-A-1 360 819, US-A-4 365 087, 
EP-B-257 565 and EP-A-253 409, etc. for reaction conditions 
therefor, and US-A-3 567 772, DE-A-20 50 155, DE-B-20 
50 155, DE-A-24 49 991, GB-A-1 482 686, GB-A-1 466 654 
and GB-A-1 468 005, etc. for oxidizing catalysts therefor. However, it is the actual state of things that 
any of these proposals aims at preparation of unsaturated 
carboxylic acids in high yields, and therefore cannot 
solve problems at all encountered in performance of the 
catalytic gaseous oxidation reaction in an industrial 
scale, that is, blocking of the piping, pressure loss in 
the reactor, etc. caused by solid organic matters, solid 
carbides, etc. (in this invention, these are generically 
referred to as "solid organic matters") formed and deposited  
 
in the reaction system due to the unsaturated 
aldehyde or the unsaturated aldehyde-containing gas as 
the raw material gas, impurities in this raw material gas 
or by-products by the reaction. More detailedly, these solid organic matters 
are formed in the piping for connection of one reactor 
with the other reactor, the portion for quenching of the 
reaction gas, or the portion for preheating of the oxidizing 
catalyst layer, or in some case on the oxidizing 
catalyst in the reaction system, and are deposited thereon, 
and cause blocking of each portion of the plant or 
abnormally increase pressure loss to hinder the running 
of the plant, or even have a danger to cause abnormal 
heat evolution or ignition at the time of stop or reoperation 
of the plant. It is the present state of things 
against these problems that the running of the plant is 
reg
