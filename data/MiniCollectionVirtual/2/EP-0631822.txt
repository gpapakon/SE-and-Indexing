<ABSTRACT>
With the aid of an application nozzle device (14), pasty material is applied to a surface (18) to be coated. The pasty mass is supplied under pressure via a conveying tube (12). The application nozzle device (14) has a shut-off device, which can be actuated by compressed air, for preventing adhesive mortar material flowing out. When the application nozzle device (14) is switched on, the compressed air supplied via a compressed-air line (16) is diverted into a flow-off line (36) in order to strike the surface (18) from the outlet opening (38) thereof. The flow-off line (36) ends, in the application movement direction (46) of the application nozzle device (14), in front of the application opening (24) thereof. The surface (18) to be provided with the pasty mass is thus cleaned of loose mechanically adhering impurities by compressed air immediately before the application of the pasty mass.

A device for mechanically applying a pasty material onto a 
surface to be processed, particularly for applying adhesive 

mortar and reinforcing mortar onto insulating boards made of 
mineral fibers, comprising 


an application nozzle device (14) which is connectable 
to a feed hose (12) for transporting the pasty material 

submitted to a feed pressure and comprises an application 
opening (24) for exhausting the pasty material, 
a pneumatic blocking device (44) for preventing the 
pasty material from exhausting when the compressed air 

acts upon the blocking device (44), and 
a compressed air control means (26;54) for optionally 
directing the compressed air either to the blocking device 

(44) for preventing the pasty material from exhausting 
from the application nozzle device (14), or 

into a drain line (36) comprising an outlet opening (38) 
which, like the application opening (38) of the application 

device (14), is directed to the surface to be processed, 
characterized in
 
that the outlet opening (38) of the drain line (36) and the 

application opening (24) of the application nozzle device 
(14) are arranged relative to each other such that the compressed 

air and the pasty material flow out separate from 
each other. 
The device according to claim 1, characterized in that the 
compressed air control means (26) comprises a manually operable 

switching valve with an inlet (28) and two outlets 
(30,32), a line (16) carrying compressed air being connectable 

to the inlet (28), and that the one outlet (30) of the 
switching valve (26) is connected with the blocking device 

(44) and the outer outlet (32) with the drain line (36).  
 
The device according to claim 1, characterized in that the 
compressed air control means comprises a manually operable 

blocking valve (54) arranged in the drain line (36), and that 
the drain line (36) and the blocking device (44) are connected 

with a line (16) carrying compressed air. 
The device according to one of claims 1 to 3, characterized 
in that the drain line (36), seen in the direction of movement 

(46) of the application nozzle device (14), ends before 
the application opening (24) thereof, the outlet opening (38) 

being directed at an acute angle to the direction of movement 
of the application nozzle device (14). 
The device according to one of claims 1 to 4, characterized 
in that the end (40) of the drain line (36) is arranged such 

that the outlet opening (38) thereof is directed away from 
the application opening (24) of the application nozzle device 

(14). 
The device according to one of claims 1 to 3, characterized 
in that the outlet opening of the drain line surrounds the 

application opening of the application nozzle device. 
The device according to claim 6, characterized in that the 
outlet opening of the drain line coaxially surrounds the 

application opening of the application nozzle device. 
The device according to one of claims 1 to 7, characterized 
in that the compressed air is either exclusively directed to 

the blocking device (44) by means of the control device 
(26;54) or can be drained via the drain line (36) when the 

blocking device (44) is relieved.
