<ABSTRACT>
In order in the case of side branch resonator to achieve good damping (attenuation) of the suction noise cost effectively in a wide frequency range, the natural frequency of the resonator is adapted (matched) to the respective excitation frequency by automatically changing the geometry of its vibrating space (treadmill). For this purpose, the resonator is preferably designed as a bellows (4) having a defined spring characteristic.

Side branch resonator for sound damping in the 
air intake section of an internal combustion engine or a 

compressor, with an excitation frequency determined by 
the oscillation frequency of the air mass in the intake 

section, in which the natural frequency adapts automatically 
during the operation of the engine to the respective 

excitation frequency, without the interposition of a 
control system, in order to achieve optimum damping in 

all operating states, characterized in that the resonator 
comprises overall a bellows (4) which has a defined 

volume or a defined length at an internal pressure 
corresponding to the atmospheric pressure and contracts 

with a reduction in volume and length when a vacuum is 
applied in the intake section (3), building up a restoring 

force in the process. 
Side branch resonator according to Claim 1, 
characterized in that the spring characteristic of the 

bellows (4) or of the travel-dependent build-up of the 
restoring force varies in such a way that, when the 

excitation frequency changes by a certain factor, the 
volume of the resonator (4) changes in inverse proportion 

to the square of this factor.
