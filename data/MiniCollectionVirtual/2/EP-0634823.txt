<ABSTRACT>
An array of semiconductor diode lasers (11, 12) is a very suitable 
radiation source for various applications such as optical read and write systems and 

laser printers. Such an array comprises a semiconductor body (10) with a substrate (1) 
and a layer structure provided thereon in which at least two lasers (11, 12) are formed 

which are mutually separated by a groove (20). In the known array, the groove (20) 
reaches down into the substrate (1), so that the lasers (11, 12) are electrically separated 

from one another. 
According to the invention, the array of lasers (11, 12) is provided with a 
groove (20) which is situated within the substrate (1) with a major portion (d) of its 

depth (D). As a result of this, the lasers (11, 12) of the array show a surprisingly low 
crosstalk. Preferably, the portion (d) of the groove (20) situated in the substrate (1) is at 

least 3 µm deep. The best results are obtained with depths (d) of approximately 10 up to 
at most 40 µm. In a very favourable embodiment, the device is provided at the upper 

side with a comparatively thick electrically and thermally well-conducting layer. In a 
preferred embodiment, the groove (20) is formed by reactive ion etching so that the 

groove (20) can be narrow and deep and the lasers (11, 12) will lie close together. A 
plasma comprising SiCl₄, Ar and CH₄ forms a particularly suitable etchant for lasers 

(11, 12) in the InGaP/InAlGaP material system.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to an optoelectronic semiconductor device 
comprising an array of at least a first and a second semiconductor diode laser - often 
referred to as laser for short hereinafter - with a semiconductor body which comprises a 
semiconductor substrate of a first conductivity type on which a semiconductor layer 
structure is situated which comprises at least in that order: a first cladding layer of the 
first conductivity type, an active layer in which a first and a second active region of the 
first and the second laser, respectively, are present, and a second cladding layer of a 
second conductivity type opposed to the first, the first and the second cladding layer 
being provided with means for electrical connection of the first and the second laser 
which are mutually separated by a groove which extends from the surface of the 
semiconductor body down into the substrate. Such a device is particularly suitable for use, for example, in a system for 
optical glass fibre communication in which the lasers of the array can act as radiation 
sources for two parallel glass fibres. The first laser of the array may be used for writing 
in an optical disc system while the second may be used for reading of the information. 
Such a device may also be advantageously used in a laser printer. Thanks to the 
presence of two lasers, a larger portion of a character to be printed can be pictured in a 
single line movement of the device than if the device were to contain only one laser. Such a device with radiation-emitting diodes is known from JP(A)2-122584 
published in Patent Abstracts of Japan, vol. 14, no. 348 (E-957)[4291] on July 
27th 1990. The device described therein comprises an array of three AlGaAs lasers on 
an n-type GaAs substrate which are separated from one another by a groove which 
extends from the surface of the semiconductor body down into the substrate. A disadvantage of the known device is that the lasers are not optimally 
separated from one another. When the device is used, crosstalk between two (adjoining) 
lasers is observed. This means that, when the voltage across one laser is raised so as to 
increase the current through and the optical power of this laser, it is observed that the  
 
optical power of an adjoining laser changes. This latter effect is undesirable in many 
applications. The present invention has for its object inter alia to provide an 
optoelectronic device with an array of lasers which does not have the said disadvantage, 
or at least to a much lesser degree,
