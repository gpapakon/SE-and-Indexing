<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a press shoe for a press 
of shoe type with extended pressure nip, said press 
comprising 
(a) a continuous, rotatable, liquid-impermeable, 
flexible endless belt member; (b) a stationary, non-rotatable support beam 
extending axially through the endless belt member; (c) said press shoe being adjustably supported by 
said support beam and having a concave surface portion; (d) hydraulic means to press the concave surface 
portion of the press shoe against the belt member so that 
the belt member and a counter roll together form an 
extended nip in the direction of rotation of the belt 
member; (e) means for the supply of a liquid lubricant to a 
surface of the press shoe being in close contact with the 
belt member; (f) said press shoe having one or more hydrostatic 
pressure pockets, each of which is preceded and followed 
by a leading land surface and a trailing land surface, 
respectively; (g) said means for the supply of lubricant 
comprising a channel opening into the hydrostatic 
pressure pocket in order to supply lubricant under 
pressure into the pressure pocket; (h) and said land surfaces having a dimension in the 
direction of rotation of the belt member that is 
sufficient for the press shoe to be of combined 
hydrostatic and hydrodynamic type.  Known press shoes of the type described above have 
hydrostatic pressure pockets the depth of which being 
substantially constant between their leading forward and 
trailing ends seen in the direction of rotation of the 
belt. Press shoes with this type of pressure pockets are  
 
shown, for instance, in US-A-5,084,137. With a pressure 
pocket shaped like this, the transition to the trailing 
land surface is very steep and this causes a number of 
problems. In order to cut out the pressure pocket the 
milling tool must be set in at least two different 
machining positions, thereby complicating manufacture of 
the press shoe and consequently increasing manufacture 
costs. During operation a hydrodynamic pressure is 
created within the region of the trailing land surface 
and the steep transition between the pressure pocket and 
this land surface induces the hydrodynamic pressure to 
increase very rapidly when it commences immediately after 
the pressure pocket. This in turn means that the paper 
web and press felts are subjected to relatively strong 
compression within a relatively short path of movement 
where this rapid increase in the hydrodynamic pressure 
occurs. Such a rapid compression of the press felts may 
at
