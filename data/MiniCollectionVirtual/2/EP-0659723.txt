<ABSTRACT>
Crude hydrocarbons with a high sulphur content of up to 1,500 ppm, of which up to 500 ppm are in the form of mercaptans, disulphides or a mixture of these can be reacted simultaneously with an alkanol or alkanediol and hydrogen in the presence of a catalyst in such a way that, at the same time, the tert-olefins are etherified, highly unsaturated compounds partially hydrogenated and the alkenes partially isomerised if the catalytic agent employed is a cation exchanger having SO3H groups and which furthermore contains 0.2-20 g of Ni, Pd or a mixture of a metal of a first group consisting of Pd, Ru, Rh and Pt and a metal from a second group consisting of Fe, Co, Ni, Cu, Ag and W, calculated as metal, per l of cation exchanger, where, in the case of a mixture, the metals from the first and the second group are present in a ratio by weight of 1:4-4:1.
