<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates generally to systems for sustained release
of active substances in the intestinal tract and more specifically to
microcapsules in suspensions as a system for delivering an active substance
for sustained release in the intestinal tract.Some medical conditions are best treated by administration of a
pharmaceutical or other active substance which is formulated to allow the
active substance or ingredient to act as quickly as possible. Such a
formulation may comprise an injectable solution, suspension, or a readily
dissolvable tablet or capsule. This type of formulation is useful, for
instance, for treating acute pain, such as headaches, or pain associated
with sudden trauma, such as an accident.Other medical conditions are best treated by administration of a
pharmaceutical or other active substance in such a way as to sustain its
action over an extended period of time. This type of administration is
usetul, for example, for treating chronic pain, such as that associated with
rheumatic or arthritic conditions, for the treatment of a chronic
cardiovascular condition, or for administering an antibiotic in a course of
treatment covering several days. Sustained action can be achieved by
related administration of an immediate-release tablet or capsule at
frequent intervals, for instance every four hours. However, this is
generally inconvenient, especially during the night, when it is often
necessary to awaken a patient to administer the suspension, tablet or
capsule. In addition, such multiple dosing may lead to undesirable
fluctuations in the plasma concentration of the active substance.It has previously been proposed to produce a formulation which will
release the active substance therein at a controlled rate such that the
amount available in the body to treat the condition is maintained at a
therapeutic level over an extended period of time. Particularly suitable
periods are twelve hours and twenty-four hours, since such formulations need
only be taken once or twice a day to maintain an effective treatment of the
condition. Such formulations are generally known as "sustained-release
formulations."Many sustained-release formulations are already known, but there is 
no generally applicable method by which such formulations can be designed.
Generally speaking, each sustained-released formulation is dependent on the
particular active substance incorporated therein. In designing a
formulation, it is generally necessary to take into account many factors,
including the rates of

<CLAIMS>
A system for the delivery of an active substance for sustained
release in the intestinal tract, comprising a particle having a core

containing an active substance, said core being encapsulated by at
least two separate layers of coating materials, in which the first layer

of coating material is immediately adjacent to the core and consists
essentially of prolamine and optionally at least one material selected

from the group consisting of plasticizers and hydrophobic
substances and said first layer is encapsulated by a second exterior

layer of a coating material consisting essentially of an enteric
compound and optionally at least one material selected from the

group consisting of plasticizers and anti-tackiness agents and such
that said exterior layer is generally resistant to disintegration in

human gastric juices, but will disintegrate in human intestinal fluids.
A system according to Claim 1 wherein said prolamine is
present in an amount from 10 to 70% of the total weight of the core

and said enteric compound is present in an amount from 10 to 70%
of the sum of the weights of the core and the first coating.
A system according to Claim 1 or 2 comprising a plurality of
said particles wherein the particles have a size of not greater than

about 700 Âµm (microns), and the system further comprises a liquid
medium, said particles being disposed within said liquid medium.
A system according to any one of Claims 1-3 wherein said
prolamine is zein. 
A system according to Claim 4 wherein the zein has an ash
content of not greater than about 2% by weight.
A system according to any one of Claims 1-5 wherein the
active substance is an antibiotic.
