<ABSTRACT>
A system of managing in MSC/VLR supplementary service procedures directed towards HLR, comprises the following steps: MSC/VLR is aware only of those operations that shall be terminated in MSC/VLR; when receiving a forward direction message within an operation from an MS, a check is made with regard to the operation intended; when the operation is known to MSC/VLR, the procedure is terminated in MSC/VLR; when the operation is not known to MSC/VLR, MSC/VLR makes no further check of the invoke component in the received forward message, but forwards the message to HLR in the condition in which it was received in MSC/VLR.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention generally relates to cellular
mobile radio systems based upon the so called GSM standard
(GSM - Global System for Mobile communication) and more
particularly to a method of managing supplementary service
procedures.A GSM network basically comprises at least one base
station system BSS including a base station controller BSC
and base station tranceivers BTS. The GSM network furthermore
includes a mobile services switching centre MSC, a home
location register HLR and a visitors location register VLR.Each subscribing mobile station MS belongs to a HLR in a
home network, wherein permanent subscriber data is stored.
When a mobile station is registered in a MSC/VLR as a new
visitor, that mobile station's HLR sends a copy of the
relevant subscriber data to MSC/VLR.Supplementary service procedures are those procedures
that are used by an MS (Mobile Station) in the GSM-system
either to change supplementary service data or to question
the network about current supplementary service data. This
procedure may, for instance, involve activating a
supplementary service, registering data for a supplementary
service, inquiring about data for a given supplementary
service, etc.In a GSM-network, subscriber data is stored permanently
in HLR as indicated above. This implies that procedures used
by an MS to request changes in subscriber service data will
preferably be terminated in HLR, which is responsible for
such data. The MSC/VLR responsible for signalling with MS
store only copies of the supplementary service data. This
data is received in MSC/VLR from HLR in conjunction with a
report from MS that the mobile is a new "visitor" in MSC/VLR.Since it is MSC/VLR that communicates directly with MS in 
conjunction with supplementary service procedures, it is
MSC/VLR that terminates these procedures as seen from MSC.
However, as mentioned, the GSM-network is distributed so
that, in the main, it is the HLR which is the actual
recipient or target of these procedures. MSC/VLR merely
constitutes a procedure transfer point. This is an exception
rather than a rule however, since certain procedures are
terminated in MSC/VLR and not all of the procedures are
transferred to HLR. An example in this respect is found in a
query which concerns data that is applicable at that time for
a given supplementary service, this query being terminated in
MSC/VLR and not in HLR. This applies, however, only to those
services that are controlled by MSC/VLR.When signalling between MS and MSC/VLR, the supplementary
service procedures

<CLAIMS>
A method of managing in a Mobile services Switching
Center/Visitor Location Register, MSC/VLR, supplementary service

procedures directed towards a Home Location Register, HLR,
characterised by the steps of


a) letting the MSC/VLR be aware only of those operations that
shall be terminated in the MSC/VLR,
b) checking the intended operation when receiving a forward
direction message within an operation from a mobile station, MS, for deciding

whether the operation is known to the MSC/VLR, and
c) if the operation is known to the MSC/VLR, terminating it in the
MSC/VLR,
d) if the operation is not known to the MSC/VLR, making no
further check of it but forwarding the message to the HLR in the

condition in which it was received in the MSC/VLR.
A method according to Claim 1, comprising

checking in step b) the invoke component of said operation by
analysing an Operation Code,
terminating in step c) the operation if the value of the
Operation Code coincides with a value known to the MSC/VLR,
making in step d) no further check of the received invoke
component if the value of the Operation Code is not known to the MSC/VLR

but forwarding it to the HLR in the condition in which it was
received in the MSC/VLR.
