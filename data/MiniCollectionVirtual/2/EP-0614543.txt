<ABSTRACT>
It is known to oscillate hollow processing drums to increase the agitation of the processing solution within the drum. However, these drums require a relatively large amount of processing solution to operate effectively, and are therefore unsuitable for unstable and/or single use processing chemistry. Described herein is a drum arrangement (10) in which a drum (14) oscillates within a generally U-shaped vessel (12), a processing tank (18) being defined between the drum (14) and the vessel (12). Photographic material (30) is driven through the tank (18) by a pair of drive rollers (24, 26) situated at the inlet (28) to the tank (18). The drum (14) is oscillated through an angle between 5 DEG  and 90 DEG  for effective processing.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to photographic 
processing apparatus and is more particularly 
concerned with the processing of photographic 
materials using low volumes of processing solution. Rotating drum arrangements are well-known 
for the processing of photographic material. 
US-A-4 613 223 discloses an arrangement in which a 
flexible sheet of photographic material is driven 
along an endless curved path within a processing tank 
by passing the sheet through nips formed between at 
least one pair of driven rollers. At least one of the 
driven rollers is the drum itself. During processing, 
the emulsion (sensitive) surface of the sheet is 
arranged not to come into contact with any stationary 
part of the processing vessel as it is being 
processed. This prevents damage to the surface during 
processing. After driving the sheet around the 
endless path for a predetermined number of cycles, 
which defines the processing time, the sheet is then 
directed out of the processing tank. The arrangement described above, has the 
disadvantage that little or no agitation is applied to 
the emulsion surface of the photographic material 
being processed. This may result in uneven processing 
of the material and variable sensitometry. It is known to provide rotating drum 
arrangements in which a secondary oscillatory motion 
is applied to the drum to improve agitation of the 
processing solutions. US-A-4 302 092 discloses a hollow rotating 
drum mounted in a support in which material to be 
processed is placed with processing solution inside 
the drum. The drum is axially slidable relative to 
the support and is driven by a hand crank against the  
 
action of a soft spring. During rotation of the drum, 
it is displaced axially relative to the support 
against the soft spring to cause the processing 
solution inside the drum to oscillate axially. US-A-3 981 488 discloses an arrangement in 
which a hollow cylindrical processing tank is mounted 
on a support for rotation. A disc is eccentrically 
mounted on a drive shaft at one end of the support to 
provide a vertical oscillating motion to the tank at 
one end. US-A-3 977 876 discloses a rotating drum 
arrangement in which oscillatory motion is provided by 
the engagement of an oblique slot with a roller or a 
circumferential rib, the slot either being carried by 
the drum itself or by the base on which the drum is 
mounted. In either case, an axial oscillatory motion 
is applied to the drum as it is rotated. US-A-3 595 156 discloses an arrangement in
