<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a new silacyclohexane compound,
a method of preparing it, and a liquid crystal composition
which contains it as well as a liquid crystal display element
which contains said liquid crystal composition.A liquid crystal display element utilizes the optical
anisotropy and dielectric anisotropy of liquid crystal substances.
Display methods include the TN mode (twisted nematic mode),
the STN mode (super twisted nematic mode), the SBE mode (super
birefringence mode), the DS mode (dynamic scattering mode),
the guest-host mode, the DAP mode ("deformation of aligned
phase" mode) and the OMI mode (optical mode interference mode).
The most common display device has a twisted nematic structure
based on the Schadt-Helfrich mode.Properties required of the liquid crystal substance
used in these liquid crystal displays are somewhat different 
depending on the display mode. However, a wide liquid crystal
temperature range and stability against moisture, air, light,
heat, electric fields, etc. are commonly required in all display
methods. Furthermore, it is desirable for the liquid crystal
material to have a low viscosity, and also to have a short
address time, low threshold voltage and high contrast in the
cell(s).Currently, there is no single compound which satisfies
all of these requirements. In practice, liquid crystal mixtures
are obtained by mixing several to more than ten liquid crystal
compounds and liquid crystal like compounds. Because of this,
it is also important that components of a liquid crystal composition
mix easily each other.Among liquid crystal compounds which can be components
for these, one of the basic components conventionally known
which controls the electro-optical performance is a compound
which has a so-called cyclohexyl ring-ethylene-cyclohexyl ring
-phenyl ring structure (CECP structure) such as those shown
by the fallowing general formulas:
In recent years, along with the expansion of the applications 
of liquid crystal displays, the characteristics required of
liquid crystal materials are becoming more and more advanced
and demanding. In particular, superior characteristics such
as a lower driving voltage, a wider temperature range for automobile
onboard use and improved low temperature performance, compared
with conventional liquid crystal substances, are desired.From such a viewpoint, this invention is a newly developed
liquid crystal substance targeting improvement in characteristics
of liquid crystal substances, and its object is to provide
a liquid crystal
