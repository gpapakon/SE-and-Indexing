<ABSTRACT>
A resistor having a novel physical geometry is provided. The 
physical geometry of the resistor minimizes the current paths through 

the resistor such that the reactance components of the resistor is 
minimized for radio frequency operation. The resistor is made from a 

resistive material such as chrome silicon oxide, nichrome. The 
physical geometry of the resistor layout reduces the physical area 

occupied by the resistor, and also results in lower sensitivity to a DC 
trimming procedure used in the manufacturing process.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates, in general, to resistors and more 
particularly to resistors that enhance the performance of radio 
frequency (RF) amplifiers. In RF operation the response characteristic of a resistor is 
determined by a resistive component and a reactance component 
wherein the reactance component is caused by, for example, parasitic 
inductance and capacitance occurring in the leads of the resistor. 
Moreover, at high frequency operation this reactance component of the 
resistor acts to reduce the effective operation of the RF amplifier. In prior art resistors, as frequency is increased, for low 
resistance values, typically less than 20 ohms, the lateral dimension 
of the resistor becomes very long compared to the wavelength of the 
current flowing through it. Since the current flow is distributed 
throughout the resistor, some current paths through the resistor are 
very long, causing long time delays. This results in a substantial 
degradation of response in radio frequency operation. Hence, there exists a need for a resistor that results in enhanced 
frequency response in radio frequency operation. The present invention provides for the physical layout geometry 
of the resistor that effectively shortens the current paths through the 
resistor and allows for a more uniform current distribution in the 
resistor. The inductive and capacitive components of the resistors are 
reduced thereby enhancing the frequency response of the resistor to 
radio frequencies. The physical geometry of the resistor layout 
reduces the physical area occupied by the resistor, and also results in 
lower sensitivity to a DC trimming procedure used in the 
manufacturing process.  FIG. 1 is a pictorial diagram illustrating a physical layout of a 
resistor in accordance to the present invention; FIG. 2 is a detailed schematic diagram illustrating an equivalent 
circuit of the resistor of FIG. 1; FIG.'s. 3 and 4 are graphical diagrams illustrating computer 
simulated response characteristics of the resistor of FIG. 1 in 
comparison to prior art resistors; and FIG. 5 is a detailed schematic diagram illustrating an RF 
amplifier utilizing the resistor of FIG. 1. Generally, the present invention provides a method and 
apparatus for producing a resistor that has enhanced frequency 
response. This can be understood by analyzing the behavior of the 
electromagnetic fields in a given resistor geometry. At frequencies 
where the maximum dimensions of the resistor are small compared 
to a wavelength, a lumped element or
