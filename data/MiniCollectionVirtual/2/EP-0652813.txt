<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a metal drilling tool and to an indexable
cutting insert for use in the drilling tool according respectively to the preambles
of claims 1 and 17. The tool according to the invention
has one or more indexable cutting inserts and is particularly designed for use in
drilling, boring, sinking, hole formation or enlarging and similar rotary
cutting operations. Such a tool is hereinafter generically referred to as a
drilling tool.It is well known, in particular in drilling holes having a large
depth-to-diameter ratio, that the drilling efficiency in terms of output, chip
flow and tool life is significantly influenced by the efficiency of chip
evacuation. In order to ensure efficient drilling and to have the chips readily
removed from a cutting zone, a width-to-thickness ratio of the chip
produced by a cutting edge of a drill should be kept within a certain
optimum range, and to this end it has been proposed to split the chip into
relatively narrow strips. Among such prior proposals is that disclosed in GB 2030487.
Here there are disclosed square inserts having cutting edges in which are
respectively formed pairs of chip splitting notches. Each notch has radially
innermost and outermost edges such that, when the insert is mounted in the
drill in a position slightly slanted with respect to an axis of the drill, the
radially innermost edge of the outermost notch of the indexed cutting edge
extends substantially parallel to the axis of the drill. The disclosure asserts
that in this way chip splitting is ensured. However, even if such chip
splitting is achieved, it is very energy consuming seeing that the workpiece
is in continuous contact with the notch. Besides, the construction of the
cutting edge cannot provide for chip splitting over the entire length of the
cutting edge as only one of the notches can be so positioned as to meet the
requirements of the disclosure.JP-59-196107, which forms the basis of the preambles of claims 1 and 17,
proposes a chip splitting solution similar to the
one described above. Here a cutting edge of an insert is formed with chip
splitting steps slightly projecting in a cutting direction. As these steps are
also in a continuous contact with a machined workpiece, the chip separation
provided by this drill is extremely energy consuming. Furthermore, in view
of the fact that it is designed for drilling deep holes, the drill is provided
with guide pads, making the whole construction more complicated and
expensive.With drilling holes of large
