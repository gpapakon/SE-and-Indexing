<ABSTRACT>
A process for preparing bean jams with adzuki 
beans soaked in water for preparing the bean jam, 

comprising applying first high voltage negative electrons 
without flowing any electric current to the beans used as 

a starting material and/or the water while a pole at the 
secondary high voltage side of a high voltage electrostatic 

transformer is completely sealed and insulated and 
a high output resistance is provided at another pole.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a process for
preparing a bean jam. More particularly, the present
invention relates to a process for preparing a bean jam,
in which adzuki bean (Vigna angularis) or the other beans
including soybeans (referred to hereinafter as "adzuki
beans") and water used for preparing bean jams are
applied with high voltage negative electrons.The operation for removing the astringent
ingredients contained in adzuki beans has been conventionally
conducted by washing the starting beans with
water and repeating the cooking of the beans in a cooker.
It is generally required for removing cyanic compounds
contained in beans to soak the starting beans for at
least four hours in warm water, to cook the beans for
several hours and to refine the resulting bean jams in
water at least three times. Soybeans have being
unsuitable as a starting material for bean jams, because
of having a high content of water-soluble ingredients.
Moreover, they are not used entirely as the starting
material, because of their having a peculiar beany
flavor.For producing bean jams of adzuki beans, a 
large amount of water is used, a high level of heat
energy is lost accordingly, and a period of at least 4-6
hours is required for preparing one batch of bean jam, so
that the daily production amount per unit is limited.In addition, as the astringent ingredients of
adzuki bean or the cyanic compounds cannot be removed
sufficiently during the soaking and cooking steps, a
large amount of water is also required for the refining
step. However, criteria for discharging waste water has
recently become severe and drainage from factories is
restricted. It has also been considered impossible to
remove astringent ingredients or cyanic compounds by
using water and to remove the beany flavor even by soaking
and cooking the soybeans according to the conventional
method.The use of the application of electrostatic potentials
for purposes not related to the present invention are known.
For example, JP-1013959 discloses the use of electrostatic
treatment of soybeans and water to improve the taste and
texture of the curd produced from soy milk. JP-63042662
discloses the use of electrostatic treatment of soybeans to
activate protein. JP-56061992 discloses the use of
electrostatic treatment in a fermentation tank to promote
fermentation and aging. "Soybean utilization" by Harry E.
Snyder and T.W. Kwon published by Van Nostrand Reinhold in
New York in 1987 gives background information on the use of
foods based on soybeans in the Orient.

<CLAIMS>
A process for the preparation of a bean jam which
comprises using an electrostatic transformer having a

first output pole which is completely sealed and
insulated and a second output pole including a high

output resistance, said electrostatic transformer
applying a 5,000 V to 20,000 V electrostatic potential,

without passing an electric current, to adzuki beans or
other beans as a starting material and/or to water for

preparing bean jam, and soaking said beans in said water
at room temperature, whereby solubility in water of

astringents or toxins associated with the beans is
improved, and further processing the soaked beans into

bean jam.
A process according to claim 1 wherein said beans
are soaked in said water for 6-12 hours.
A process according to claim 1 or 2 wherein said
water for preparing bean jam comprises water for soaking

beans and water for cooking said beans.
A process according to claim 4 wherein the other
beans comprise soybeans.
