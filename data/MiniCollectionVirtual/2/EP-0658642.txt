<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a device for removing yarn turns (8) in the underwinding region (7) of spindles (1) of a ring-spinning or ring-twisting machine, the device (5) movable along the machine having a milling element (9) acting on the thread turns (8) and a spacer (12) resiliently connected to the milling element (9) and bearing in each case on the outer circumference (10) of at least one spindle wharve (11). According to the invention, the milling element (9) is provided with at least one milling cutter (13) loading the thread turns (8). The device is assigned, furthermore, a monitoring means (14) which triggers a signal when the distance between the milling cutter (13) and underwinding region (7) falls below an intended minimum value.

Device for removing thread spirals in the 
underwind region (7) of spindles (1) of a ring spinning 

or ring twisting machine, wherein the device (5), which 
can travel along the machine, has a milling element (9) 

acting on the thread spirals (8) and also a spacer (12) 
connected to the milling element and bearing resiliently 

against the outer circumference of in each case at least 
one spindle wharve (11), characterized in that the 

milling element (9) is provided with at least one milling 
cutting edge (13) acting on the thread spirals (8), and 

in that the device has associated with it a monitoring 
device (14) which triggers a signal when the distance 

between the milling cutting edge (13) and the underwind 
region (7) falls below a given minimum. 
Device according to Claim 1, characterized in 
that the monitoring device (14) operates electrically and 

is in the form of a contacting, capacitive or inductive 
distance sensor. 
Device according to Claim 2, characterized in 
that a contact bar (16) is provided, which, when the 

distance between the milling cutting edge (13) and the 
underwind region (7) falls below a given minimum, makes 

contact with the outer circumference (10) of a spindle 
wharve (11) or of a test pin (17) and thereby triggers a 

signal via another part (18) of the monitoring device 
(14). 
Device according to Claim 1, characterized in 
that the milling cutting edges (13) are arranged 

obliquely relative to the longitudinal axis (A-A) of the 
spindles (1).  

 
Device according to Claim 4, characterized in 
that the oblique arrangement of the milling cutting edges 

(13), in relation to the direction of rotation of the 
spindle, is such that thread parts milled off drop off 

from the underwind region (7). 
Device according to Claim 1, characterized in 
that the spacer (12) extends over more than one spindle 

pitch. 
Device according to Claim 6, characterized in 
that the spacer (12) has run-up skids (20, 21) at both 

ends. 
Device according to Claim 1, characterized in 
that the milling element (9) is arranged between the 

spacer (12) and the pivot point (22) of the mounting. 
Device according to one of the preceding claims, 
characterized in that the device is equipped with at 

least one catcher tip (64, 65) which points in the 
direction of movement of the device and which engages 

behind and separates a piecing thread (60) stretched 
between the underwind region (7) and the cop (15). 
Device according to Claim 9, characterized in 
that a catcher tip (64, 65) is arranged at each of the 

two ends of a cutting beam (63) connected to the device. 
Device according to Claim 9 or 10, characterized 
in that cutting edges (66, 67) are attached to the 

catcher tips (64, 65). 
Device according to Claim 11, characterized in 
that the cutting edges (66, 67) are each given a ground 

surface. 
Device according to Claim 10, characterized in 
that the cutting beam (63) is mounted, on a carriage (19) 

movable along the spindles (1), in such a manner that it 
can move until the spacer (12) bears against the spindle 

wharve (11). 
Device according to Claim 13, characterized in 
that the carriage (19) has a pivotable lever (23) on 

which the cutting beam (63) is arranged.
