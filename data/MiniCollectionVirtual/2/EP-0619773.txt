A method for manufacturing blocks from a
mixture of a hydraulic binder, such as plaster, an

inert filler, such as sand, and water, the hydraulic
binder increasing in volume during its hydration and

the said mixture being molded under pressure during a
period of time that is sufficient for obtaining

hydration under pressure of the hydraulic binder and
obtaining a densification of its crystal lattice, the

method consisting in placing a measured quantity of
the mixture in a mold having undeformable side walls

(30) and top and bottom horizontal plates (38, 40)
that are movable in vertical translation inside the

mold with small clearance relative to the side walls,
in slowly displacing at least one of the plates in

the mold on successive predetermined strokes so as to
settle the mixture inside the mold and to impart a

predefined height to the block to be obtained by
progressively compressing the mixture in the mold, in

keeping said plates in place during the above
hydration period of the hydraulic binder by resisting

its volumic expansion, and then in moving one of the
plates away for the purpose of unmolding the block by

displacing the other plate towards the inside of the
mold.
A method according to claim 1, characterized
in that it consists in detecting the pressure

increase in the mold that results from the hydration
of the hydraulic binder for defining the end of the

above period and then in unmolding the building block
once this pressure has reached a predetermined value.
A method according to claim 1 or 2,
characterized in that it consists in displacing some 

of the side walls of the mold over a short distance
in an outward direction in order to facilitate

unmolding.
An apparatus for carrying out of the method
according to claims 1, 2 or 3, comprising a mold

having undeformable side walls (30) and top and
bottom horizontal plates (38, 40) which are movable

in translation inside the mold with a small clearance
relative to the side walls, means (52, 90) for

positioning the bottom plate in the mold, means (54)
for filling the mold with a measured quantity of said

mixture, means for installing the top plate (38) in
the mold, at least one hydraulic press (62) for

displacing at least one of the plates (38, 40) inside
the mold to settle the mixture inside the mold and to

compress it under high pressure until the desired
height of the block to be obtained, means for

withdrawing at least one of the plates from the mold,
and hydraulically actuated unmolding means (80) for

extracting the block from the mold, characterized in
that the press (62) is controlled for slowly

displacing one or both of said plates inside the mold
over successive predetermined settling and

compressing strokes and in that the device comprises
means (70,74,90,92) independent from the press for

keeping the plates in place in the mold during the
expansion of the hydraulic binder resulting from its

hydration.
An apparatus according to claim 4,
characterized in that it comprises means (76) for

detecting a pressure increase of the mixture in the
mold that results from the hydration of the hydraulic

binder. 
An apparatus according to claim 4,
characterized in that the vertical walls of the mold

are surrounded by at least one rigid support frame
(86) which includes means (88) for transverse

displacement of at least two adjacent vertical walls
of the mold over a short distance.
An apparatus according to any one of claims
4 to 6, characterized in that it comprises at least

one station (A) for filling the mold, a station (C)
for compressing the mixture inside the mold and an

unmolding station (F) and means for transferring the
mold between these three stations.
An apparatus according to any one of claims
4 to 7, characterized in that it also comprises means

(84) for grasping and transferring the block
extracted from the mold.
An apparatus according to any one of claims
4 to 8, characterized in that at least the top plate

(138) of the mold includes an oblique rim (44) over
at least a fraction of a periphery of its face that

comes into contact with the mixture in the mold for
forming a chamfer (28) over at least a fraction of a

top peripheral edge of the building block.
An apparatus according to any one of claims
4 to 9, characterized in that the bottom plate of the

mold includes at least one projecting core (46) on
its face that comes into contact with the mixture in

the mold, the core enabling at least one cavity (18)
to be formed in the building block.
An apparatus according to any one of claims
4 to 10, characterized in that said press comprises 

top and bottom plates (58, 60) between which the mold
is placed, and which are connected by a mechanical

transmission suitable for positively defining a
minimum distance between the plates of the press that

corresponds to the height desired for the building
block, and for ensuring that the plates of the press

are parallel.
An apparatus according to any one of claims
4 to 11, characterized in that the means (70, 74, 90,

92) for keeping the mold plates in place in the mold
are mechanical and/or hydraulic means.
An apparatus according to any one of claims
4 to 12, characterized in that the means for keeping

the mold plates in place comprise bearing means (70,
72) or locking means (92).
An apparatus according to any one of claims
4 to 13, characterized in that at least one of the

large vertical walls (30) of the mold is designed to
receive a plate for decorating the building block.
An apparatus according to any one of claims
4 to 14, characterized in that it is disposed at an

outlet from an installation for producing plaster.
