<ABSTRACT>
An ultrasonic probe having one or more piezoelectric ceramic elements, each having a respective 
bulk acoustic impedance. Each element has a respective front face and a respective piezoelectric 

ceramic layer integral therewith to provide efficient acoustic coupling between the probe and a 
medium under examination by the probe. The respective piezoelectric layer of each element 

includes shallow grooves disposed on the respective front face of each piezoelectric element. A 
groove volume fraction of the piezoelectric layer is selected to control acoustic impedance of the 

piezoelectric layer so as to provide a desired acoustic impedance match between the bulk acoustic 
impedance of the element and an acoustic impedance of a medium under examination by the probe. 

Electrodes extend into and contact the grooves, imposing electrical boundary requirements that 
support a desired electrical field distribution within the element.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention generally relates to ultrasonic probes and more specifically to 
ultrasonic probes for acoustic imaging. Ultrasonic probes provide a convenient and accurate way of gathering information about 
various structures of interest within a body being analyzed. In general, the various structures of 
interest have acoustic impedances that are different than an acoustic impedance of a medium of 
the body surrounding the structures. In operation, such ultrasonic probes generate a broadband 
signal of acoustic waves that is then acoustically coupled from the probe into the medium of the 
body so that the acoustic signal is transmitted into the body. As the acoustic signal propagates 
through the body, part of the signal is reflected by the various structures within the body and then 
received by the ultrasonic probe. By analyzing a relative temporal delay and intensity of the 
reflected acoustic waves received by the probe, a spaced relation of the various structures within 
the body and qualities related to the acoustic impedance of the structures can be extrapolated from 
the reflected signal. For example, medical ultrasonic probes provide a convenient and accurate way for a 
physician to collect imaging data of various anatomical parts, such as heart tissue or fetal tissue 
structures within a body of a patient. In general, the heart or fetal tissues of interest have acoustic 
impedances that are different than an acoustic impedance of a fluid medium of the body surrounding 
the tissue structures. In operation, such a medical probe generates a broadband signal of acoustic 
waves that is then acoustically coupled from a front portion of the probe into the medium of the 
patient's body, so that the signal is transmitted into the patient's body. Typically, this acoustic 
coupling is achieved by pressing the front portion of the probe into contact with a surface of the 
abdomen of the patient. Alternatively, more invasive means are used, such as inserting the front 
portion of the probe into the patient's body through a catheter. As the acoustic signal propagates through the patient's body, portions of the signal are 
weakly reflected by the various tissue structures within the body and received by the front portion 
of the ultrasonic medical probe. As the weakly reflected acoustic waves propagate through the 
probe, they are electrically sensed by electrodes coupled thereto. By analyzing a relative temporal 
delay and intensity of the weakly reflected waves received by the medical probe,
