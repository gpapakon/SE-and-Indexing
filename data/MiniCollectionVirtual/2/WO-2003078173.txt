<ABSTRACT>
The present invention generally relates to a convenient and aesthetically pleasing way to label a wide variety of objects. The invention includes both an adhesive image transfer sheet assembly and a method for labeling a disc using standard computer equipment typically found in a home or office, such as an ink jet printer. One embodiment of the invention relates to an adhesive image transfer sheet assembly having a backing sheet that is coated with an ink-receptive coating. The coating is activatable to a tacky state by the application of light pressure or heat, and/or by wetting the coating with ink jet ink. The assembly may also be pre-cut to a particular shape, so as to correspond to the shape of a disc, for instance. An other embodiment of the invention relates to a method of labeling an object using the adhesive image transfer sheet assembly. After receiving printing, the ink-receptive coating is placed against the upper surface of the disc, and the user lighty rubs the backing sheet. The light rubbing activates the ink-receptive coating to a tacky state, causing the ink-receptive coating to adhere to the disc. The user can then pull away the backing layer, which may be release-coated for easily separating the backing from the ink-receptive coating. An additional water-resistant layer may be provided on the assembly, in between the ink-receptive coating and the backing sheet, to provide a protective layer over the image after the image has been transferred to the disc.

<DESCRIPTION>
 SHEET STRUCTURE AND METHOD FOR ADHESIVE IMAGE TRANSFERRELATED APPLICATIONS[0001]This application claims priority of U.S. Provisional Application Serial No. 60/252,174 entitled "Structure and Method for Adhesive Image Transfer," filed November 16, 2000, which is incorporated by reference in its entirety.BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION[0002] General Background and State of the Art: There are a wide variety of applications for labels, such as labeling files, folders, and various storage media (e.g. compact discs and floppy discs), as well as other items, including personal effects. Manufacturers also use labels to label bottles, jars, boxes and the like. Other various packaging, shipping and storage containers require some sort of labeling for identification purposes. A label is typically imprinted with alpha-numeric characters and/or graphics.[0003] Standard label assemblies include a release liner that is coated with a release layer such as silicone. The release liner is removably adhered to a die-cut face stock label that is coated with a pressure-sensitive adhesive. The facestock is typically paper but can alternatively be coated plastic, metallic film, or any of a variety of sheet materials known in the art. In use, one removes the label from the release liner, such as an envelope, packaging or other surface to be labeled, and then applies the label to the substrate that is to be labeled.[0004] Methods have recently been developed that do not require the use of the facestock component that is usually found in label constructions. Instead, text and/or graphics are transferred directly onto a substrate by using ink-receptive, activatable polymers that hold the printed image and that are directly transferred onto a substrate. This "label-less" approach to image transfer prints the image into the activatable, ink- receptive polymer rather than onto a facestock that is coated with adhesive.[0005] U.S. Patent Nos. 5,969,069 and 6,124,417 to Su et al., which are both incorporated by reference herein, disclose some water-activatable acrylic compositions and various constructions for transferring images onto substrates. Each of the constructions generally includes a polymer layer upon which an ink jet printer prints with water-based ink. The polymer layer becomes tacky within the regions of a 

wetted printed image, for example, but not in the non-printed regions. While the adhesive is still wet from printing, the adhesive is applied to a substrate and the backing or liner layer is removed.[0006] U.S. Patent No.
