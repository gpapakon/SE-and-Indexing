<ABSTRACT>
A sheet material handling apparatus having a 
rotatable drum and clamps (16,45) for holding the sheet 

material on the drum (11) during high speed rotation. The 
clamps are arranged to rely on centrifugal force as the 

primary operational clamping force during the high 
speed rotation. One clamp (16) is eccentrically mounted on 

a pivot axis with a greater mass on a segment of the 
clamp adapted to pivot away from the drum surface 

during high speed rotation. A second clamp (45) is 
contacted by a slidable counterweight mounted on the 

drum opposite the central rotation axis of the drum 
from the second clamp such centrifugal force of the 

counterweight (40) enhances clamping of the sheet material 
to the drum surface.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to the field of high speed 
rotatable drum sheet handlers and more specifically to 
apparatus for securing flexible sheet material to such 
sheet handlers used, for example, in electrostatic 
copier or photographic film or print read/write 
apparatus. Many applications require the temporary securing 
of a flexible sheet of material to a rotatable drum. 
Apparatus such as electrostatic copiers and facsimile 
machines as well as photographic and graphic film/print 
apparatus are examples of equipment requiring the 
supporting of a sheet of paper or film during the 
reading and writing processes. Specific examples of such apparatus are found in 
U.S. Patent 4,033,575-Fujimoto and U.S. Patent 
4,807,868-Lippold which show two types of automatic 
sheet feed and delivery apparatus employing rotatable 
cam and lever mechanisms for controlling clamps that 
hold the sheet material on the drum. The apparatus 
shown in the '575 patent has the disadvantage that very 
complex and costly apparatus is employed in the 
clamping arrangement that becomes difficult and 
expensive to operate and maintain. In the '867 patent, 
less complex leading and trailing edge clamps are shown 
for securing the sheet to the drum which relies on the 
spring tension of the clamps themselves for the  
 
securing force. This latter arrangement has the 
disadvantage of having the clamps being susceptible to 
centrifugal force, reducing the spring tension applied 
to the sheet clamps and, as a consequence, reducing the 
sheet holding properties of the clamp arrangement which 
can be a particular problem at higher rotational 
speeds. It is apparent from the foregoing that there is a 
need for relatively simple and easy to operate and 
maintain apparatus for a rotating drum sheet handler 
that reliably retains the sheet material on the drum in 
the face of centrifugal forces encountered during 
rotation of the drum that adversely affect the clamping 
action of the sheet material clamps. The present 
invention satisfies this need. It is therefore an object of the invention to 
provide a new and improved apparatus for mounting a 
flexible sheet of material securely onto a rotatable 
drum. It is another object of the invention to provide 
an apparatus for supporting a flexible sheet of 
material securely on a rotatable drum with minimal 
contact to the major area of the outfacing sheet 
surface. A further object of the invention is to provide an 
apparatus for securing a sheet of flexible material to 
a drum which is

<CLAIMS>
Apparatus for rotating a flexible sheet of 
material about a central axis of rotation, the 

apparatus including a drum having a cylindrical surface 
rotatable about said central axis, a sheet material 

clamp for clamping an edge of the flexible sheet onto 
the drum surface, spring bias means for providing said 

clamp with an initial clamping force on the sheet 
material and clamp releasing means for selectably 

releasing the clamp from the sheet material; 
   the apparatus characterized by: 

   the clamp having a mass so associated therewith as 
to transfer operational centrifugal force to the clamp 

which serve as the primary clamping force for securing 
the sheet to the drum at operational rotating speeds of 

the drum. 
The apparatus of claim 1 wherein said clamp 
comprises an elongated bar eccentrically mounted on the 

drum about a pivot axis such that a greater mass of the 
bar is on a side of the pivot axis that pivots away 

from the drum during operational rotation of the drum 
and a lesser mass of the bar is on a side of the pivot 

axis that pivots toward the drum for clamping of the 
sheet material to the drum. 
The apparatus of claim 1 wherein the clamp is 
pivoted about a clamp pivot axis parallel to said 

central axis and has a first segment on one side of the 
pivot axis adapted to pivot toward said drum surface in 

response to said spring bias means to apply said 
initial clamping force to said sheet material and a 

second segment, opposite the clamp pivot axis from said 
first clamp segment, adapted to pivot away from the 

drum surface when clamping force is applied to said 
 

sheet material, the second segment having greater mass 
than said first segment such that centrifugal force 

exerted by said second segment during rotation of the 
drum increases the clamping force on the sheet material 

beyond said initial clamping force with increasing 
rotational speed of the drum. 
Apparatus according to claim 3 wherein said 
clamp releasing means comprises at least one follower 

roller adapted to engage said second segment of the 
clamp during sheet material loading and unloading 

operations to pivot the first segment of the clamp away 
from the drum surface against the restoring force of 

said spring bias means. 
Apparatus according to claim 1 wherein the 
initial clamping force of said spring bias means is 

sufficient to secure the sheet material to the drum 
during low speed sheet loading and unloading operation 

but is insufficient to secure the sheet material to the 
drum surface during relatively higher operational 

rotating speeds of the drum. 
Apparatus according to claim 1 further 
including a counterweight in contact with said clamp, 

the counterweight being slidably mounted to said drum 
on an opposite side of the drum central axis from the 

clamp and being rotatable with the drum to cause said 
clamp to exert increasing clamping force on the sheet 

material with increasing rotational speed of the drum. 
Apparatus for rotating a flexible sheet of 
material about a central axis of rotation, comprising: 

   a drum having a cylindrical surface rotatable 
about said central axis, 

   a first sheet material clamp having an edge for 
 

engaging an end of the flexible sheet on the drum 
surface, said first clamp being comprised of an 

elongated bar eccentrically mounted on the drum about a 
pivot axis such that a greater mass of the bar is on a 

side of the pivot axis that pivots away from the drum 
during operational rotation of the drum and a lesser 

mass of the bar is on a side of the pivot axis that 
pivots toward the drum for clamping of the sheet 

material to the drum;; 
   first spring bias means for urging said first 

clamp edge against the sheet material with an initial 
clamping force; 

   first clamp releasing means for selectably 
releasing said first clamp edge from the sheet 

material; 
   a second sheet material clamp having an edge 

adapted to engage another end of the sheet material on 
the drum surface; 

   second spring bias means for urging the second 
clamp edge against the sheet material with an initial 

clamping force; 
   second clamp releasing means for selectably 

releasing said second clamp edge from the sheet 
material; and 

   a counterweight in contact with said second clamp, 
the counterweight being slidably mounted to said drum 

on an opposite side of the drum central axis from said 
second clamp and being rotatable with the drum to cause 

said second clamp to exert increasing clamping force on 
the sheet material with increasing rotational speed of 

the drum.
