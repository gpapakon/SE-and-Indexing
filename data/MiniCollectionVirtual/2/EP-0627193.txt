<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to the field of disposable biomedical 
electrodes for establishing an electrical connection between the 
skin of the human anatomy and an electromedical apparatus such as 
a high impedance electromyograph, electrocardiograph, 
electrostimulator for pain relief and the like. More 
specifically, the present invention is directed to a disposable 
biomedical electrode having a secured one-piece conductive 
terminal which is formed using less material, resulting in 
decreased manufacturing expenses. The biomedical electrode can 
also include an improved electrolytic gel which provides more 
comfort for the patient while maintaining electrical performance. 
Many types of disposable biomedical electrodes have been 
introduced in recent years. Typically they comprise: (1) a 
metallic or electrically-conductive carbon terminal member having 
means for electrical connection to an electromedical apparatus 
such as an electrocardiograph; (2) an adhesive tape or pad for 
holding the terminal member in place on the skin; and (3) an 
electrically-conductive, conformable interfacing material such as 
an electrolyte gel or paste over the surface of the terminal 
member which contacts the skin to reduce skin impedance and to 
improve electrical contact between the skin and the terminal 
member. Disposable biomedical electrodes have been improved in the 
last few years by the introduction of electrically-conductive, 
pressure-sensitive adhesives to replace conventional electrolyte 
gels and creams. Such gels were generally unpleasant to use and, 
because of their high water content, required elaborate packaging 
to prevent "dry-out" problems. The electrically-conductive, 
pressure-sensitive adhesives are not as comfortable for patients 
when attached to their skin in that they do not provide a 
soothing or moist feeling and hair tends to be torn away from the  
 
patient's body upon removal of the electrode. It would be 
desirable, therefore, to have a disposable biomedical electrode 
which includes an electrolyte gel which is more comfortable for 
the patient, yet does not experience "dry-out" problems or 
reduced electrical performance. For ease of connection to the lead wire of an electromedical 
device, the terminal member of many disposable biomedical 
electrodes is formed in the shape of the male portion of a snap 
fastener adapted to engage the female portion of the snap 
fastener attached to the lead wire of the electromedical device. 
Such a terminal member comprises a flat, circular portion
