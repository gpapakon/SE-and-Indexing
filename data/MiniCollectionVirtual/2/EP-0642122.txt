<ABSTRACT>
A recordable optical disc (20) on which information 
is recorded by applying a light beam on the surface thereof, 

includes: a first recording area (22 - 25) on which information 
is recorded and reproduced while the disc is rotated at a first 

linear velocity; and a second recording area (26- 28) on which 
information is recorded and reproduced while the disc is 

rotated at a second linear velocity. Each of the first 
recording area and the second recording area includes a test 

recording area (22, 26) for use in determining optimum 
recording power of the light beam for recording information in 

the recording area, respectively.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a recordable
optical disc and a recording apparatus therefor, and more
particularly to a recordable optical disc and a recording
apparatus suitable for recording signal according to CDV
(Compact Disc Video) format.Conventionally, there is CD (Compact Disc), known as
a media for reproduction only, on which music information is
recorded. There has recently been developed a recordable
compact disc (CD-R:Recordable Compact Disc). Recording format
of CD-R is generally referred to as "Orange Book", and it is in
conformity with recording format of CD. FIGS. 1A and 1B
illustrate physical format of CD-R. In CD-R, a lead-in area 4,
a program area 5 and a lead-out area 6 are formed from inner
circumference of the disc to outer circumference thereof, like
the format of CD. In addition, in CD-R, a PCA (Power
Calibration Area) 2 and a PMA (Power Memory Area) 3 are
provided radially inwardly of the lead-in area 4, as
illustrated in FIG. 1.Recording track on the R-CD is provided with guide
groove that is wobbled by the frequency of a carrier of 22.05
kHz which is frequency-modulated by data indicating absolute 
time information (ATIP: Absolute Time In Pregroove). A laser
beam for recording desired information is moved to follow the
guide grooves under tracking servo control, and rotational
speed of spindle motor which rotates the R-CD is controlled so
that the wobbling guide groove pattern has a central frequency
of 22.05 kHz. In this manner, tracking servo and spindle-motor
servo controls can be effected on unrecorded R-CDs as well as
recorded R-CDs.The PCA 2 is an area where test recording is carried
out prior to an actual information recording process, so that
the power of the recording laser beam will be optimized for
recording desired information in the information recording
process. The PCA 2 is composed of a count area and a test area.
The count area has a plurality of subareas corresponding respectively
to a plurality of subareas of the test area, and
each containing a suitable EFM signal recorded therein. Test
recording for measuring an optimum recording laser beam power
is carried out in the subareas of the test area. One of the
subareas of the test area is consumed by a single test
recording.Any subarea of the test area which has once been used
by test recording is not available for a next test recording.
It is therefore necessary to search for an unused subarea
positioned radially inwardly of the used subarea for use in the
next test recording. The count area is provided to
