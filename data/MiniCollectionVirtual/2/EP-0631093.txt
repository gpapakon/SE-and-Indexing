<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a combustion chamber comprising: two annular walls (2, 3) connected by a bottom (4), delimiting a combustion enclosure (5); fuel injectors (10) of a first group which are intended for the idling mode, and fuel injectors (14) of a second group which are intended for full-gas mode; and a gas-separating assembly (19) fixed on said bottom and interposed between the fuel injectors (10, 14) of the two groups. According to the invention, the separating assembly comprises a plurality of elementary sectors (19) which are separate from one another, each being fixed (34) on the bottom (4) independently of the other sectors. One application is the production of a combustion chamber, in which the problems of fixing the separating assembly on the bottom are solved in a satisfactory manner and which, as a result, is reliable.

Combustion chamber assembly having a structure 
comprising two annular walls (2, 3) spaced apart, joined 

together by an end (4) and delimiting therewith a combustion 
chamber (5); an axis (1) of almost symmetry of the 

said annular walls; fuel injectors (10, 14) split into 
two distinct groups, the fuel injectors (10) of a first 

group being intended to supply fuel during a first 
operating mode, such as idling speed, and the fuel 

injectors (14) of the second group being intended to 
supply fuel during a second operating mode, such as wide-open 

throttle; passages (12) for letting in oxidizing 
agent formed in the said end (4); and, a gas separator 

assembly (16) comprising a plurality of elemental separator 
sectors (19) distinct from one another, one adjacent 

to the next, arranged annularly, each being fixed (34) to 
the end (4) independently of the other elemental separator 

sectors and fixed to the said structure and interposed 
between the fuel injectors (10, 14) of the two said 

groups, each separator sector (19) being shaped into an 
elongate body having two transverse ends (30, 31), each 

of them arranged facing and separated from a transverse 
end of an adjacent separator sector (19) by a defined 

space (32), characterized in that at least one of the two 
adjacent separator sectors (19) is hollow and capable of 

containing a gas under pressure, while at least one (30, 
31) of the transverse ends of the said separator sector 

is perforated with holes (37, 38) allowing the said gas 
under pressure to escape from this separator sector into 

the said defined space (32), therein creating a screen of  
 

gas under pressure. 
Combustion chamber assembly according to Claim 1, 
characterized in that the transverse ends (30, 31) of the 

various separator sectors have identical shapes, the 
transverse ends of each separator sector constituting a 

first transverse end (30) and a second transverse end 
(31) which are arranged facing a second transverse end 

(31) and a first transverse end (30) of the separator 
sectors adjacent to the said separator sector and being 

perforated with a first set (37) and with a second set 
(38), respectively, of holes, the axes of the holes of 

the second set (38) of a second transverse end (31) being 
offset with respect to the axes of the holes of a first 

set (37) of an adjacent first transverse end (30) and 

vice versa so that the axes of the holes of one set of 
perforations in one transverse end interfere with the 

transverse end arranged facing it and so that the gas 
under pressure passing through the said holes plays a 

part in cooling the transverse end with which the axes of 
the said holes interfere. 
Combustion chamber assembly according to Claim 2, 
characterized in that the axes of the holes (38) of a 

second set of perforations of a second transverse end 
(31) are arranged in a staggered configuration with 

respect to those of the first set of perforations (37) of 
the first end (30) arranged facing it and belonging to an 

adjacent separator sector. 
Combustion chamber assembly according to any one 
of Claims 1 to 3, characterized in that the perforated 

set of holes (37, 38) in one transverse end (30, 31) of 
one separator sector (19) are configured in such a way 

that the gas under pressure passing through the said 
holes plays a part in cooling the said transverse end 

(30, 31). 
Combustion chamber assembly according to any one 
of Claims 1 to 4, characterized in that the transverse 

ends of one separator sector (19) extend into the combustion 
chamber from the end (4) of the combustion chamber 

assembly, having their ends (141, 142) furthest from the  
 

said end diverging from one another in an axial plane.
