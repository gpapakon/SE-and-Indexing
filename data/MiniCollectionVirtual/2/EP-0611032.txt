<ABSTRACT>
An apparatus for dipping tablets (10) into gelatin coating 
material and for spreading and setting the coating 

immediately after dipping is provided. Carrier plates (50) having 
a plurality of tablet holders (30) are transported from a tablet 

loading station to a dipping station along a transport guide. 
At the dipping station, a carrier plate is mounted to a 

vacuum chamber (60). A set of vacuum tubes in the vacuum chamber 
are extended through the tablet holders to contact and lift 

the tablets off of the holders and secure the tablets to the 
tubes. In a preferred embodiment, the vacuum chamber is 

rotated 180° and a second carrier plate (50') is mounted onto the 
housing and a second set of tubes secure the tablets to the 

plate. The carrier plates are alternately dipped and 
returned to the guide means where new plates with uncoated 

tablets replace the plates with coated tablets. Immediately 
after dipping the carrier plates enter a rotating station 

where the plate is rotated 360° and then replaced on the 
guide means for transportation to further processing 

stations. Preferably, the rotating station includes a 
similar vacuum chamber with vacuum tubes that are extended 

into the holder for securing the tablet during rotation.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to methods and apparatus for 
forming a coating on a product and, more particularly, to 
methods and apparatus for forming a coating comprised of a 
gelatinous substance on a tablet. The present invention 
further relates to a methods and apparatus for dipping 
tablets into the coating material. The present invention is related to US-A-4,921,108; 
US-A-4,867,983; US-A-4,820,524; US-A-4,966,771; and 
EP-A-0,448,231. The present invention is also related to European Patent 
applications EP-A-0611563, EP-A-0614654, EP-A-0607009 and 
EP-A-0607008, all filed concurrently herewith.  
 Many products, from prescription drugs to commonly available 
vitamin tablets to candy, are manufactured in a form which 
may be described as a "tablet." The primary function of a 
tablet is to provide a single dose or "serving" of the 
product in a manner which is convenient to manufacture, 
package and consume. As pointed out in my previous patents 
and applications, referenced above, it has been found that 
certain individuals suffer from physiological and 
psychological problems which impede their ability to swallow 
tablets. It has also been found that by providing tablets 
with a smooth coating, such as a coating comprised of gelatin 
or a gelatinous substance that the "swallowability" of a 
tablet is greatly enhanced. Such coatings and the general 
considerations involved in their application, such as 
preparation and drying time, are well known to those of 
ordinary skill. In addition to enhanced swallowability, there are numerous 
other reasons that it is desirable to provide a coating on a 
tablet. Such coatings protect the underlying product from 
deterioration and also serve to permit identifying colors or 
markings to be incorporated onto the design of the product, 
promoting product differentiation and brand identification. 
As pointed out in my previous patents and applications, it is 
also desirable in some instances to overlap two or more 
coatings to form a seam, thereby simulating the appearance of 
a hard gelatin capsule while providing a coated, solid (and 
thus tamper resistant) product.  
 Methods and apparatus for applying a gelatinous coating or 
other coating to a product which is in the form of a tablet 
are well known to those of ordinary skill. Such methods may 
include pan dipping or vacuum spraying of the coating 
material on to the tablet. Such methods are crude, however, 
producing uneven coatings which are generally unacceptable 
for commercial use. In an effort to
