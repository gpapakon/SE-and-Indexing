<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to apparatus for testing wound components such 
as a transformer. In order to test thoroughly a wound component such as a transformer, 
it is necessary to measure a variety of parameters such as: the 
winding resistance (of both the primary and secondary windings), the 
turns ratios, the winding inductance or magnetising current and the 
interwinding capacitance. It is also usual to test the insulation at both 
high and low voltage levels. These parameters are conventionally 
measured by sequentially connecting the transformer to a series of 
separate pieces of test equipment each of which is dedicated to testing 
one particular parameter. Such testing thus requires several, usually 
expensive and relatively large pieces of equipment, to test fully the 
transformer. At each stage, the transformer has to be electrically 
connected to the relevant test equipment, the test carried out, then 
electrically disconnected and moved on to the next piece of test 
equipment and the operation repeated for each test to be carried out. 
This procedure is time consuming and error prone as wires may be 
wrongly connected, measuring equipment mis-read, results incorrectly 
recorded etc. Apparatus has also been provided for automatically and sequentially 
connecting a transformer to a plurality of separate pieces of test 
equipment using a matrix of relays under the control of a computer. 
This automates the connecting and disconnecting of the various pieces 
of test equipment but a separate piece of equipment is still required to 
carry out each test. This means that a benchful of equipment is still 
required to test a component which itself may be relatively small, 
e.g. with maximum dimensions in the order of 10-20cms. The lengthy 
leads required to connect the different pieces of equipment also makes 
some measurements difficult, e.g. high frequency tests with leads over  
 
2 m in length. This form of test apparatus is also still relatively 
slow, e.g. taking 30 seconds or more to test a transformer fully, and 
is of necessity relatively expensive. GB-A-2157837 discloses circuit testing apparatus comprising an array 
of bi-directionally current conducting analog switching networks each 
of which defines a test point for connection to a node of a circuit 
board and connectable under software control of the respective 
switching network to a stimulus source or ground and simultaneously 
to an input of a measurement facility. This invention aims to provide test apparatus which is much more 
compac

Apparatus for testing a wound component comprising a plurality 
of connectors (9,10,11,12...) for connecting to the component to 

be tested; signal generating means (19,21) selectively connectable 
to one or more of the connectors (9,10,11,12...) for applying a 

variety of different test signals to the component to be tested; 
measuring means (23) selectively connectable to measure a variety 

of different outputs from the component to be tested; and control 
means (22) for controlling which of the connectors (9,10,11,12...) 

are connected to the signal generating means (19,21) and the 
connection of the measuring means (23) to one or more outputs of 

the component being tested, for controlling the signals applied by
