<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an improvement in opthalmic lens design and more 
specifically relates to such a lens which provides bifocal vision. Presbyopia is a vision defect associated with advancing age. The presbyopic patient lacks 
visual accomodation, i.e. the ability of the eye to adjust to clearly see objects that are close 
to or at intermediate distances from the eye without the aid of a corrective lens. The common correction for presbyopia is to use bifocal eyeglasses which have an upper 
portion ground for distance viewing, having most commonly, a correction for myopia or 
hyperopia, and a lower portion with diopters added for near viewing. However, this 
solution does not readily lend itself to contact lenses, which tend to move with the eyeball 
and disrupt vision. To overcome this problem, bifocal contact lenses have been used 
which have a thick lower edge which is engaged by the lower eyelid when the wearer 
looks down, causing the contact lens to slide upwards on the cornea relative to the pupil. 
Such lenses which move relative to the eye are hard to fit because the lens must be sized 
properly to be engaged by the lower lid. Also, the amount of movement of the lens must 
be accurately measured to determine the desired height of the bifocal segment. There have been a number attempts at providing bifocal lenses which avoid the problems 
of the above-described, thick edged lens. One group of attempts provides a multifocal 
diffractive lens constructed by means of a series of concentric, phase manipulating annular 
rings. The rings provide simultaneous focal powers for near and distant vision having 
sharp transitions. Diffractive ophthalmic lenses are known from e.g. US-A- 5 120 120, US-A-5 071 207, or EP-A-0 109 753. A second group of attempts relates to a multifocal ophthalmic lenses 
having a plurality of concentric rings with a continuously varying power within each zone 
as well as in transition form one zone to another. The zones are accomplished either by 
continuously changing curvature of the posterior surface of the lens, or by creating 
non-homogeneous surface characteristics having refractive material indices which  
 
continuously vary in the lens radial direction. A problem exists, however, in that the concentric ring configurations described above are 
closed and form sealed regions around the cornea. The central portion of the human 
cornea is a very important optical component to vision. Proper tear flow at the central 
portion is critical to corneal health. Contact
