<ABSTRACT>
A fixing roller for use in an electrophotographic 
apparatus wherein copy paper carrying a toner image formed 

thereon is passed between a pair of rollers so that the toner 
image is thermally fixed on the copy paper. The fixing 

roller includes a roller substrate (1) having a hollow core, an 
elastic layer (2) made of silicone rubber formed on an outer 

surface of the roller substrate (1), a fluororubber layer (4), and 
a release layer (5) consisting of fluororesin are provided in 

this order. An adhesion layer (3) for silicone rubber and 
fluororubber is provided between the silicone rubber elastic 

layer (2) and the fluororubber layer (4).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a fixing roller of 
the general type used in the fixing part of an 
electrophotographic copier, laser printer, facsimile machine, 
etc. The electrophotographic process generally includes a 
step in which a light-sensitive body is exposed to an image 
to form an electrostatic latent image on the light-sensitive 
body. Then, a colored charged particles toner powder is made 
to adhere to this electrostatic latent image so as to develop 
the image. The toner image is then transferred onto a piece 
of copy paper (sheet-like transfer material or recording 
material) in an un-fixed state. Finally, the unfixed toner 
image is fixed onto the copy paper by a method such as 
heating. With regard to the fixing method, there are various 
methods such as heat roller fixing, fixing by the oven method 
(using the radiated heat of the heater), and pressure fixing. 
Among these, the most often-used fixing method in recent 
years is the heat roller fixing method wherein a pair of 
rollers internally provided with heating sources such as 
electric heaters and having their outer surfaces coated with  
 
rubber or resin of excellent releasability are urged against 
each other, and copy paper carrying a toner image formed 
thereon is passed between these rollers so that the toner 
image is fused onto transfer paper. In this case, a heating 
source may be provided in only one of the rollers so that the 
one roller is used as a heat fixing roller, while the other 
is used as a pressing roller. Compared to other fixing methods, the heat roller 
fixing method has a very high thermal efficiency, and is 
suited to high speed operations, but it has a defect that the 
life of the heat roller is short. Ordinarily, a fixing roller is configured so that an 
elastic layer and a resin layer are provided for purposes of 
offset prevention on the outer surface of a metallic roller 
(core) which is formed by metal such as stainless steel or 
aluminum. Conventionally, as an improved fixing roller, 
Japanese Patent Post-examination Publication No. Hei-1-24311, 
for example, proposes a fixing roller with a configuration 
where the outer surface of the metal roller is coated with an 
elastic layer consisting of fluororubber or silicone rubber, 
and, further, a layer consisting of fluororesin on top of 
this elastic layer. With regard to this fixing roller, not 
only is it superior in terms of the non-stickiness of the 
surface, but also abrasion or injury of the fluororesin layer 
is inhibited in the case where a
