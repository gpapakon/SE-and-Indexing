<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to compositions for construction 
materials suitable for use in the building industry and 
in particular for bitumen or bitumen-like compositions 
subjected to strains at lower temperatures such as road 
surfaces. Bitumen and bitumen-like materials have been modified 
with a variety of polymers in order to add strength in 
a variety of environmental conditions encountered in 
for example road paving and roof membranes. Both 
polymer-type and blending/mixing process must be 
selected to accommodate prevailing requirements in the 
industry. As examples of such modification, there can be 
mentioned : 
1. Bitumen sheeting. Styrene-butadiene block 
copolymers and ethylene-propylene rubbers have 
been added to provide increased strength. 2. Synthetic binders. Formulations including 
hydrocarbon tackifier resins which are transparent 
and can be colored having been made less brittle 
by including polymers. 3. Road surfaces. Bitumen or asphalt has been 
modified with styrene-butadiene block copolymers, 
ethylene propylene rubber, ethylene vinyl acetate  
 
and methylacrylate copolymers, propylene-butene 
copolymers to improve wear resistance. Propylenebutene 
copolymers (Vestoplast made by Huels AG) 
have been used to improve physical properties at 
low temperatures. 4. Thermoplastic road marking. Formulations include 
hydrocarbon tackifiers ethylene vinyl acetate 
(EVA) and styrene-isoprene-styrene block copolymer 
(SIS). Examples of patent specifications include :
 
   FR 1 368 242 ; US 3395110 ; US 3459695 ;
 
   US 4263186; US 3 444 117 ; GB 2 164 344 ;
 
   GB 1247247 ; GB 1522852. EP 174 795 ; EP 351736.
 
   US 3 669 918 ; US 3 790 519. Dow EP 416 815 discloses the modification of asphalt or 
bitumen using polymers made with monocyclopentadienyl 
derivatives and a suitable cocatalyst but no particular 
polymer types are identified for this application. US 4263186 relates to bitumen and polymer containing 
compositions for making sheets which employs high 
amounts of ethylene based elastomers and varying 
amounts of a partially crystalline polyolefin. There 
is no disclosure of the use of a limited amount of a 
particular ethylene based copolymer having a 
crystallinity of less than 18 %. EP 351736 discloses waterproof sheets containing major 
amounts ethylene based copolymers. Example 9 uses a 
polymer having a density of 0.88.  GB 1522852 discloses an adhesive composition containing 
bitumen, block copolymer and a small amount of a 
thermoplastic polymer having a crystallinity
