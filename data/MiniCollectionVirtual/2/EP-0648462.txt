<ABSTRACT>
The structure of the machine comprises a small bell-shaped work-head to the polar area 
of which is secured the drive unit (2) and whose mouth is closed by means of a base plate (3) 

corresponding to the operative area of the machine. The drive shaft (4) projects axially from the 
drive unit and is also axially arranged within the frame (1) and having at its end a conical plate (5) 

which sets in motion a plurality of satellite gears (8). Said machine is intended to the treatment 
of staircases, floors, walls, ceilings, beams, etc., carrying out various operations such as polishing, 

sanding, cleaning, etc.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a machine that has 
been particularly devised to treat staircases, floors, 
ceilings, walls, beams or any other surfaces whatsoever, 
that is capable of carrying out various operations upon 
such surfaces, namely polishing, sanding, cleaning and so 
forth, concurrently serving a sucking function, or 
eliminating the resulting waste, and by merely fitting on 
it at each time the type of brush that is most suitable 
for the job that is to be carried out. The market naturally has a wide range of machines 
capable of performing any of the jobs aforesaid, viz. 
cleaning, sanding, polishing as well as sucking, and yet 
every machine is designed for a specific job and moreover 
machines devised to work on the floor are unable to work 
or unsuitable for working upon walls and ceilings, and 
vice versa. It is therefore necessary to have a machine specific 
to each particular kind of job, with the bother that this 
entails from the standpoint of investment, storage, 
maintenance and manipulation. The multi-use machine subject of the invention is  
 
capable of undertaking all the jobs aforesaid, upon 
staircases, floors and walls, ceilings or any other 
surface whatsoever, its structural features being such as 
to render the machine extremely handy at all times and 
moreover to provide a high working efficiency. More specifically and in order to achieve the above, 
the machine structurally comprises a small generally cup-shaped 
head the polar end of which is fitted with the 
power unit and the mouth of which is closed by means of 
a base plate constituting the operative area of the 
machine. The drive shaft projects axially from the power unit 
and lies axially within the shell, ending in a conical 
plate through which movement is transmitted to a number 
of satellites, which are preferably four and likewise 
conical, co-planar with the said plate and related 
thereto through a resilient ring associated to the centre 
plate that acts as the drive means for the said 
satellites, the shafts of which cross the base plate with 
the assistance of bearings and are externally fitted with 
respective tools. In accordance with another characteristic of the 
invention the said conical plate is mounted to turn 
axially about the drive shaft, and is hence duly keyed 
thereto, the said conical plate being biased by springs 
that work as a clutch to define the extent of pressure 
with which the repeatedly mentioned conical plate leans 
through the resilient ring upon the likewise conical 
satel
</DESCRIPTION>
<CLAIMS>
A multi-use machine for the treatment of 
staircases, floors, walls and ceilings, characterised by 

comprising a head wherein a cup-shaped shell is 
established, the power unit of the machine being fitted 

to its polar end and its mouth being closed by a base 
plate constituting the operative plane of the machine, 

the handle or stem of the machine being hinged to such 
head through a fork, being especially particular in that 

the shaft of the power unit, that runs from the inside of 
the head to the neighbourhood of the base plate, receives 

a conical plate provided with a peripheral groove on its 
circumference or conical surface in which a resilient 

ring is fitted to constitute the transmission means by 
friction from such conical plate to a number of likewise 

conical satellites, coplanar with such plate, which 
shafts cross through the said base plate with the 

assistance of bearings and are externally fitted with the 
respective tools, which can be exchanged depending upon 

whether the machine is to perform a polishing, sanding or 
merely cleaning job. 
A multi-use machine for the treatment of 
staircases, floors, walls and ceilings, as in claim 1, 

characterised in that the conical plate is mounted upon 
the drive shaft and can slide axially, to which end it is 

duly keyed thereto, the said shaft having an end 
projection that serves as an abutment to limit the travel 

of such plate, resilient means being in turn provided 
between such plate and the shell of the head, preferably 

comprising a pair of springs that bias the central 
conical plate against the external conical satellites 

through the resilient transmission ring linking the same. 
A multi-use machine for the treatment of 
staircases, floors, walls and ceilings, as in the above 

claims, characterised in that the power unit 
contemporaneously acts upon a suction unit likewise 

provided within the shell and designed to eliminate the 
waste produced by the machine whilst working normally, to 

which end the base plate, that is the operative surface 
of the machine, is profusely perforated to define a 

suction grid.
