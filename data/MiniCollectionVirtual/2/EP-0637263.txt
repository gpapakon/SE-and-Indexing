<ABSTRACT>
A conical-bottom (2) silo, particularly suitable for small-sized plastic material with properties of high elasticity, comprises a conical screw stirrer (8) inserted axially in the conical bottom (2) of the silo. The conical screw (12) of the stirrer (8) is discontinuous and divided into several sections. Moreover the silo has means of discharging the material arranged below an outlet port positioned laterally in relation to said stirrer and consisting of two co-operating cylindrical screws (17).

<DESCRIPTION>
 SILO WITH CONICAL STIRRER SCREW FOR ELASTIC GRANULES* * * *D E S C R I P T I O N The present invention relates to a conicaL-bottom silo which is particularly, albeit not solely, suitable for small-sized plastic material and rubber with characteristics of high elasticity as in the case of plastics of the "stretch" type (LLPE, linear, low, polyethylene). Silos for small-sizecl plastic material are already known, such as the silo described in the Italian patent no. 1078053. This patent relates to a conical-bottom silo with a conical screw stirrer inserted axially in the conical bottom of the silo and a cylindrical screw delivery and outLet part situated at an outlet port arranged laterally in relation to the stirrer at the lower end of the conical bottom of the silo itself. A silo of this type functions perfectly for the various kinds of small-sized plastic material except in the case wherein particularly elastic plastics and rubber are being dealt with. With a* material having these properties areas of compression can in fact form in the conical bottom of the silo due to the action performed by the stirrer. Blocks of materials, which prevent the conical screw and the relative motor from moving, are then created in these areas. As a result thereof there is discontinuity of operations and feed (metering) of the material during delivery and strong mechanical stress of the screw with subsequent damage thereto and possible breakage of the motor.The main object of the present invention is therefore to provide a conical-bottom silo with a conical screw stirrer, 

particularly suitable for plastic materials and rubber with high elasticity.In accordance with the invention the main object is achieved by means of a conical-bottom silo with a conical screw stirrer inserted axially in the conical bottom of the silo, characterised in that the conical screw of the stirrer is discontinuous and divided into several sections.The use of a thus discontinous conical screw-allows the action of compression on the material, which occurs during the movement of the stirrer itself, to be released: the divisions of the screw, enabLing the material to expand, in fact prevent the formation of compressed blocks of material inside the lower conical body of the silo.The features of the present invention will be made clearer by the following detailed description of its possible embodiments, shown by way of a non-limitative example in the accompanying drawings, in which:Fig. 1 shows in an axial section the lower part of a silo according
