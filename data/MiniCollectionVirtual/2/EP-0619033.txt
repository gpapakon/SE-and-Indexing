<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to controllers for photographic 
lighting. For normal photography fairly simple illumination may be 
required from time to time to enhance or make it possible 
to take a picture satisfactorily. For more complex 
situations, a photographer may require especial lighting to 
show one side of an object more brightly than another, to 
take a number of related sequence pictures or to expose the 
same film frame a number of times and so on. At the present time operation of lighting arrangements have 
generally or always to be carried out "by hand", often 
requiring the photographer to employ assistants or take a 
great deal of time for each picture. Further, conventional 
flash lamps requires re-charging periods of say one to five 
seconds between each flash, and this has to be catered for. 
This may represent a special problem for "location" 
pictures as the photographers will transport only 
relatively small capacity or small output lamps and will 
need to flash them twice or several times for each exposure 
so that the film is exposed to sufficient light. Earlier proposals for controllers are disclosed in EP-A-5016037, 
where two modes of operation are provided using a 
microprocessor, and in "General Radio Experimenter" Vol. 44, 
No. 7-9, July 1970, pages 15-17 and "Elektor Electronics"  
 
Vol. 5, No.11, November 1979, pages 14-15, where sequence 
modes of flashing lamps are disclosed. According to the invention there is provided a controller 
for photographic lighting comprising a housing 
and being arranged to provide a plurality of output 
signals at output sockets provided in the housing for initiating operation 
of a number of different flash lamps, the 
controller further comprising a microcomputer incorporated within the housing and programmed to provide the 
output signals to cause a number of lamps to be turned on 
automatically and selectively according to at least two modes to illuminate an object to be 
photographed characterised in that in the first 
mode the lamps are turned on together a number of times 
but not necessarily all the lamps are turned on the same 
number of times, and in the second mode the lamps are turned on 
sequentially with an equal time interval between the turning on of the lamps 
in the sequence, and in that the controller further comprises manually operable buttons mounted to 
the housing for selecting the number, sequence and relative 
timing of the output signals. The microcomputer may be programmed to provide a third mode 
in which the lamps

<CLAIMS>
A controller for photographic lighting 
comprising a housing (1) and being arranged to provide a 

plurality of output signals at output sockets (15) provided in the housing for 
initiating operation of a number of different flash lamps, 

the controller further comprising a microcomputer incorporated within the housing and programmed to 
provide the output signals to cause a number of lamps to be 

turned on automatically and selectively according to at least two modes to illuminate an 
object to be photographed, 

characterised in that in the first mode the lamps are turned on 
together a number of times but not necessarily all the 

lamps are turned on the same number of times, and in the second mode 
the lamps are turned on sequentially with an equal time 

interval between the turning on of the lamps in the sequence, and 
in that the controller further comprises manually 

operable buttons (11) mounted to the housing for selecting the 
number, sequence and relative timing of the output signals. 
A controller according to claim 1, characterised by 
the microcomputer being programmed to provide a third mode 

in which the lamps are turned on sequentially 
with at least some of the time intervals between the turning on of the lamps 

being different. 
A controller according to claim 1 or 2, characterised 
in that the controller is arranged to respond to camera 

operating signals for synchonising automatically the 
operation of the camera and the turning on of the lamps.
