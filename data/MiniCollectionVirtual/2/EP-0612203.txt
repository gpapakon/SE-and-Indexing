<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to an automatic soldering 
apparatus for performing soldering automatically to 
effect electrical connections in order to mount 
electronic parts on a printed circuit board, an 
apparatus for a method of teaching soldering condition 
information, which is necessary for soldering, to the 
automatic soldering apparatus, a soldering inspection 
apparatus and method functioning to judge whether a 
soldered location is acceptable or not and generate 
information indicative of soldering correction 
conditions in order to correct a defective location in a 
case of a soldering defect, and an automatic soldering 
correction apparatus and method for automatically 
correcting a faulty soldered location. Soldering apparatus presently available include a 
soldering apparatus that relies upon a flow soldering 
method in which a board on which electronic parts have 
been mounted in advance is dipped in a soldering bath to 
perform soldering, and a soldering apparatus that relies 
upon a reflow soldering method in which electronic parts 
are placed on a soldering cream that has been applied to  
 
part mounting positions on the surface of a board and 
the electronic parts are welded by application of heat. However, each of these conventional soldering 
apparatus can be applied only to cases in which 
identical soldering conditions hold for all parts; they 
cannot be applied to cases where parts having markedly 
different thermal capacities or parts having a very 
small pitch between their leads are mounted on a board. 
These apparatus require that such parts be soldered 
individually manually or by robot. The development of electronics manufacturing 
techniques has been accompanied by a diversification in 
the form of the electronic parts used. An increase in 
specially ordered parts and parts of a type different 
from the standard type has been accompanied by an 
increase in soldering locations that are unsuited to 
blanket soldering by soldering apparatus of the above-mentioned 
kind, and boards appear which require that all 
parts be soldered under individual conditions. Practical application of an automatic soldering 
apparatus capable of performing soldering on a board 
automatically under soldering conditions that differ for 
each part is desired. In such an automatic soldering 
apparatus, it is required that the positions at which 
parts are to be soldered, the kinds of parts and the 
kinds of soldering conditions be instructed for each 
type of board before the soldering operation. The
