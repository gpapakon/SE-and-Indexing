<ABSTRACT>
A laser imaging apparatus includes a laser 
diode (16) which is controlled to produce a laser beam 

the power of which varies linearly as a function of a 
digital image input signal (12). The laser beam is 

deflected by scanning optics to expose photosensitive 
media such as film. When the digital image input 

signal (12) is in a first range of values to operate 
the laser diode (16) in its linear region, the laser 

diode (16) is controlled (24),(28) to operate in an 
amplitude modulation mode. When the digital image 

input signal (12) is in a second, lower, range of 
values which would operate the laser diode (16) in its 

non-linear operating region, the laser diode (16) is 
controlled (26),(30) to operate in the linear region 

but in a pulse amplitude modulation mode.

<DESCRIPTION>
In general, the present invention relates to
laser printer apparatus for exposing photosensitive
media by means of a scanning laser. More particularly,
the present invention relates to laser diode printer
apparatus wherein the exposure characteristics of a
laser diode are optimized so that the maximum range of
exposure (Emax -Emin) is obtained without the use of
the light emitting diode (LED) region of the laser
diode.A laser diode operates in two distinct
regions which includes a laser region and a LED region.
As shown in FIG. 1, the laser region is characterized
by a linear relationship between the laser diode drive
current above a threshold current, and the output
illuminative power. In the LED region, the
relationship between the drive current and the output
illuminative power is non-linear, and the change in
output illuminative power is very small for a change in
current, relative to the laser region of operation. A
means of using laser diodes for exposure in laser
printers, is to drive the laser diode with a digital to
analog converter (DAC) which equally divides the
current into 2N-1 values, where N equals the number of
bits input to the DAC. Because the laser diode
efficiency (which is measured as milliwatts output
power, per unit milliamp of input current) is very
small in the LED region, a large range of input signal
code values results in very little change in exposure.One type of laser printer uses an n bit (for
example, 12 bit) DAC which drives an exposure device (a
He-Ne gas laser and acoustooptic modulator or laser
diode). The exposure device then prints exposures upon
photosensitive media such as film. An output lookup
table is constructed, through which the data is mapped 
prior to digital to analog conversion. The lookup
table is calculated to force a linear mapping from code
value to film density.In the high density region of the Density vs.
Log Exposure (D LogE) film curve, the delta exposure
for a constant delta density is much greater than in
the low density region. As a result, the output lookup
table maps a number of input code values to a single
output code value in the high density or high exposure
region. This results in an inefficient use of code
values for exposure.It is known that the threshold of visibility
for a small change in luminance is relatively constant
in the luminance region over which radiographs are
viewed (see M.I. Sezan, K. Yip, S.J. Daly, "Uniform
Perceptual Quantization: Applications to Digital
Radiography," IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and
Cybernetics

A laser imaging apparatus comprising a laser

a lower nonlinear LED region, said apparatus having means

first range of digital values above a predetermined
transition value which would operate the laser diode (16)

in the linear region and having a second lower range of

is an amplitude modulation (AM) mode, and the second

modulation mode is a pulse amplitude modulation (PAM)
mode, and that the predetermined transition value between

the linear region and the nonlinear region is lowered by
injecting an RF (radio frequency) signal into the AM mode

means (24, 26) for comparing the value of the digital image
input signal to a predetermined digital transition value,

such that when the compared value is greater than the
predetermined transition value, the laser diode (16) is

operate in the pulse amplitude modulation mode. 
The apparatus of claims 1 or 2 wherein in the
PAM mode the pulse location within a pixel period is

randomly distributed within the pixel period to minimize
banding effects.
