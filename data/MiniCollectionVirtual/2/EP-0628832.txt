<ABSTRACT>
In order to test an integrated circuit having a sequential logic, the register stages contained therein are switched in series as a shift register. In this case, running time problems can arise which can be avoided by a two-phase operation of the register stages, as is the case, for example, with the known LSSD technology. For a high processing speed, however, edge-triggered register stages are more favourable. According to the invention, register stages are therefore proposed which can easily be switched over between a two-phase operation during testing and edge triggering in normal operation. In this case, only one additional clock line is required.

clock input causing a signal applied to the data input to be stored and to be supplied to the
output,
