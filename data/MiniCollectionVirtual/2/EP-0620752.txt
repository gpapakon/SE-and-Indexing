<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to the field of swim fins. More 
particularly this invention relates to the modification of swim 
fins which can vary the effect of the swimmers foot and leg 
stroke on the water through which the swimmer swims, for 
various end results. Human beings, with proper training, are capable of swimming 
on the surface of the water. For brief periods, and with 
proper equipment for extended periods, swimmers can also swim 
under the surface of the water. People have long recognized, 
however, that the human anatomy is not designed to facilitate 
rapid and easy movement through the water. Most aquatic 
animals can swim much better and faster than the speediest 
human being. In an effort to improve man's swimming abilities, a number 
of inventors have designed and produced fins adapted to be worn 
on the feet while swimming. Generally, fins have a foot 
retaining portion and a relatively large blade extending in a 
forward direction with respect to the body. Most are made from 
elastomeric materials such as rubber, polyurethane or 
silicones. Newer fins are made from combinations of these 
materials and may be reinforced with strengthening fillers such 
as graphite. Some fins were designed to emulate the anatomy of aquatic 
animals. An example is U.S. Patent No. 2,423,571 granted to 
Wilen in 1947. Wilen's designs are graceful and fluted and the  
 
inventor specifically states that he intended to copy the 
design of fish tails. Other fins were designed to take advantage of hydrodynamic 
principles. One example is U.S. Patent No. 4,209,866 granted 
to Loeffler in 1980. Loeffler presents a fin with a pivotally 
mounted blade which increases swimming efficiency. Another 
example is U.S. Patent No. 3,183,529 granted to Beuchat in 
1965. This design has a series of slots in the blade which jet 
water in the direction of swimming when the swimmer executes 
his downstroke. This is claimed to increase swimming speed. Still others are designed to take advantage of the 
properties of newly available materials. U.S. Patents 
4,929,206 and 4,857,024 describe fins with upwardly curving 
blade tips. This design results in an opening of the blade as 
the swimmer executes a power or downstroke and a snapping 
action of the tips as the swimmer executes an upstroke. The 
opening action on the downstroke increases propelling force 
while the snapping action on the upstroke decreases the amount 
of energy needed by the swimmer to reposition his leg for 
another downstroke. Much of the prior art equates
