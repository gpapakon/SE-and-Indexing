<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a dormer window, composed of a front wall (24), of two side walls (42) and of a roof (36), provision being made for a supporting frame (10) which comprises two frame parts (8, 9) which are each made up of a supporting case (12, 14) and a transverse load-bearing member (37) which is arranged at the upper end of the supporting case, both the supporting case (12, 14) and the transverse load-bearing member (37) being adjustable in length. The two frame parts (8, 9) are connected to one another on the front side by at least one transverse strut (16, 18). Front (25) and side windows (40) or side elements can be introduced into the supporting frame (10), which forms a structural unit. Due to the capacity for length adjustment, in particular the supporting case (12, 14) and the transverse load-bearing member (37) - thus the entire dormer window - can be aligned during mounting.
