<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to aqueous compositions containing 
calcium chloride intended for use particularly (but not exclusively) in 
the drilling of wells in subterranean formations, e.g. for oil or gas 
exploration/recovery. It is known to use a solution of calcium chloride (a so-called 
calcium chloride brine) as a fluid for use in the course of oil-well 
drilling, both as a drilling fluid and as a workover fluid/completion 
fluid after an oil-well is in production. However, solutions containing 
calcium chloride as the only dissolved salt have a maximum practical 
density of about 1.35 g/cm-3 which may not be sufficiently high for 
drilling at great depths or into high pressure formations. To increase 
the density of calcium chloride solutions, it is known to include 
calcium bromide and/or zinc bromide but the zinc bromide component 
has acute environmental and economic disadvantages. A further problem is that the low ambient temperatures 
encountered in oil/gas/hydrocarbon exploration in some areas of the 
world (e.g. the North Sea) can result in crystallisation of the calcium 
chloride from solutions containing more than 35% calcium chloride so 
that the fluid cannot be used. US-A-4 609 476 states that high density brine fluids for drilling 
operations may be solutions containing 10-60% by weight of salts such 
as CaCl2, NaBr, NaCl, KSCN, Ca(NO3)2, ZnCl2, ZnBr2, CaBr2, KI, LiCl, 
CaI2, Ca(SCN)2 and their mixtures having densities up to about 2.4g/cc. 
Although one possible mixture which is covered by this statement 
would comprise calcium chloride and calcium nitrate, there is no 
specific disclosure of such a formulation in the patent and therefore 
no suggestion as to the relative proportions in which these two 
components would be used. According to a first aspect of the present invention there is 
provided an aqueous composition comprising water in which are 
dissolved calcium chloride and caicium nitrate wherein the composition 
has a density of at least 1.35g cm-3, and the weight ratio of calcium 
chloride to calcium nitrate is in the range 5:95 to 95.5, e.g. 5:95 to 
85:15. Although the compositions of the invention are defined as 
comprising dissolved calcium chloride and calcium nitrate, it should  
 
be appreciated that (at least in certain cases) it may be possible to 
formulate the compositions by dissolving other compounds which 
together provide the necessary calcium, chloride and nitrate ions. 
Therefore the terms dissolved calcium chloride and calcium nitrate are 
not to be
