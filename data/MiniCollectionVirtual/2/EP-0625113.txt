Process for manufacturing a fluid-tight boat-shaped packaging
tray from a cardboard blank comprising a bottom (2) surrounded by sides

(3, 4, 5, 6) connected in pairs by means of bellows (7) comprising two
portions (8, 9) intended to bear against the internal face of one of said

sides (3, 4, 5, 6), the first portion (8) of the bellows, adjacent to the side (3,
4, 5, 6) receiving said bellows, having a cut-out (11) in its upper portion,

the process comprising :

providing the tray with first portion (8) of bellows extending over
substantially half of the height of the sides (3, 4, 5, 6),
applying an adhesive on one side only of the cardboard blank, to the
zones (14) of the sides (5, 6) intended to receive the portions (8, 9) of the

bellows (7),
erecting the sides (3, 4, 5, 6),
folding back the two portions (8, 9) of the bellows (7) against the
receiving side (5, 6) in order to rigidly lock one of the faces of the first

portion (8) of the bellows in the lower zone, and the other face of the
second portion (9) in the upper zone,

the corresponding gluing means being adjusted in order to prevent or stop
any liquid that may rise by capillary action from reaching the cut edges of

the cardboard blank.
The process according to claim 1, characterized in that it
consists of applying glue to the sides (5, 6) by means of two spots of glue

(15, 16), one (15) at the level of the upper edge (12) of the first portion (8)
of the bellows in order to block the transition line between the first and

second portions (8, 9) of the bellows, and the other (16) in the upper
portion in order to rigidly lock the second portion (9) of the bellows.
Fluid-tight boat-shaped packaging tray obtained by the process
according to any one of the claims 1 or 2, said tray comprising a bottom

(2) surrounded by sides (3, 4, 5, 6) connected in pairs by means of 
bellows (7), said bellows comprising two portions (8, 9) which bear against

the internal face of one of said sides (3, 4, 5, 6) by means of an adhesive
applied on one side only of the cardboard blank, to the zones (14) of the

sides (5, 6) intended to receive the portions (8, 9) of the bellows (7), the
first portion (8) of the bellows extending over substantially half of the

height of the sides (3, 4, 5, 6).
The fluid-tight tray according to claim 3, characterized in that it
comprises first portions (8) of bellows (7) of which all the upper portion is

cut away.
The fluid-tight tray according to claim 4, characterized in that it
comprises first portions (8) of bellows provided with a cut-out (11) which

allows said bellows (7) to be retained over a height of at least 1
centimeter.
The fluid-tight tray according to any one of claims 3 to 5,
characterized in that the bellows (7) are folded back on two opposite sides

(5, 6).
The fluid-tight tray according to any one of claims 3 to 6,
characterized in that it comprises an internal face treated so as to be

impermeable.
The fluid-tight tray according to any one of claims 3 to 7,
characterized in that it does not comprise any prepared folds between the

second portion (9) of the bellows and the side (3, 4) adjacent to that (5, 6)
which receives said bellows (7).
