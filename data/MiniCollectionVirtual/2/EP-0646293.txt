<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a charge electrode (6) with a metal casing (11) housing two or more individual electrodes as well as protective resistors (1) arranged therein, which can be connected to a high-voltage source (U). The individual electrodes have points (3), which project from the correspondingly open electrode housing (7). Each point (7) can be covered by an electrically conductive cover device (4) connected to the casing (11), and the latter and the cover device (4) are connected to the terminal of a resistor, the other terminal of which can be earthed.
