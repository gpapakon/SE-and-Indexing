as to straddle a portion of a rotary brake disc (20) secured 
for a road wheel, a friction pad (50) supported on 

the caliper member by means of a pair of hanger pins (41,42) 
to be moved toward and away from one side surface of

therefrom, the friction pad (50) having a backing plate 

(52) secured thereto to be engaged at one side end face 
thereof with a torque receiving portion (30b) of the caliper 

member (30) in braking operation and a fluid actuator 
(33) mounted within the caliper member (30) to press the friction 

pad (50) against the one side surface of the brake disc (20), a 
side projection (53a3,52c,30b1,30c1) is provided on 

at least an upper or lower portion of the one side end face 
of the backing plate (52) for engagement with the torque 

receiving portion (30b) of the caliper member (30) or on at 
least an upper or lower portion of the torque receiving 

portion (30b) of the caliper member for engagement with the 
one side face of said backing plate (52). The side projection 

(53a3,52c,30b1,30c1) is arranged to apply a rotational force to the 
backing 

plate (52) in a rotational direction of the brake disc (20) when 
engaged with the torque receiving portion (30b) of the caliper

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a disc brake assembly
in which a friction pad is applied to one or each side
surface of a rotary brake disc secured for rotation with a
road wheel of a wheeled vehicle, and more particularly to
an improvement in the disc brake assembly for reducing
braking noises caused by vibration of the friction pad.Disclosed in Japanese Utility Model Examined Publication No. 57-55550
is a disc brake assembly of this kind which includes
a caliper member mounted on a vehicle body structure in
such a manner as to straddle a portion of a rotary brake
disc secured for rotation with a road wheel, a pair of
friction pads supported on the caliper member by means of a
pair of hanger pins and opposed to each side surface of the
brake disc to be moved toward and away from the brake disc,
and a pair of fluid actuators mounted within the caliper
member to press the friction pads against each side surface
of the brake disc. In the conventional disc brake assembly, 
as shown in Fig. 14(A), a backing plate 12 of the
friction pad carried by hanger pins 11a, 11b is drawn in a
rotational direction of the brake disc when the friction
pad is pressed into contact with the brake disc by depression
of a brake pedal. In this instance, as shown in Fig.
14(B), the backing plate 12 is engaged at its one side end
face with a torque receiving portion 13a formed on an inside
face of the caliper member, while the other side end face
12b of the backing plate 12 is separated from a torque
receiving portion 13b formed on the opposite inside face of
the caliper member. This causes vibration of the friction
pad in the axial direction of hanger pins 11a, 11b, resulting
in occurrence of braking noises in braking operation.It is, therefore, a primary object of the present
invention to provide an improved disc brake assembly wherein
the backing plate of the friction pad is applied with a
rotational force in braking operation and engaged at its
different two positions with the caliper member or a member
assembled therewith to restrain vibration of the friction
pad for reducing the braking noises.According to the present invention, the object is
attained by providing a disc brake assembly for a wheeled
vehicle which includes a caliper member mounted on a vehicle
body structure in such a manner as to straddle a portion
of a rotary brake disc secured for a road wheel of the 
vehicle, a friction pad supported on the caliper member 
to be moved toward and away from one side
surface of said brake disc in an axial direction for
