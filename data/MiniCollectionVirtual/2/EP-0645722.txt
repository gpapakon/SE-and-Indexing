<ABSTRACT>
A data processing apparatus (1) has a data and program 
structure (20) which includes category files (23) for fast 

and automatic identification and retrieval of relevant 
formula files (30) containing the necessary program 

commands. A data processing instruction includes the 
address of one or more data files (21, 22, 24, 25), the 

combination providing for fast identification of the 
relevant formula files (30) via an inter-linked category 

file (23). Codes identifying relevant formula files (30) 
are written to an array structure (40), which is hard 

coded into disks (4). Formula files are automatically 
written to an empty formula file array structure (41) 

having a corresponding result array structure (42) with 
rows corresponding to each row of the formula file array 

structure (41). The result array structure (42) provides 
for fast writing of results to files (21-25). A fast 

response time is achieved and there is versatility in the 
nature of the processing.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a data processing apparatus of
the type having a user interface, and central processing
unit (CPU) connected to a storage device and to a random
access memory. In particular, the invention relates to
the technical electronic structure of the data storage
device and also to the technical steps carried out by the
CPU accessing the storage devices in order to provide the
following technical results:-
1. An improved response time, particularly where
complex processing must be carried out on a large
amount of stored data;2. improved data processing versatility, whereby the
processing operations may be easily changed by a
user; and3. improved data security, whereby stored data may
not be easily over-written with incorrect data.Heretofore, many particular data processing apparatus
constructions have been provided in order to improve
response time and processing efficiency generally. For
example, European Patent Specification No. EP-B1-0074390
(Unisys Corp.) describes a data processing system
including caches having fast access times and various
processing units communicating with the caches. Such an
arrangement is of use in most data processing situations.
However, in particular situations where there is a very
large amount of data, where very complex processing must
take place and where a large amount of versatility must be
provided for modification of the processing operations
carried out, such an arrangement still does not on its own
provide the necessary technical results. An example of 
the type of situation where this would arise is in data
relating to inter-linked units where the processing may
relate to individual units or sets of units grouped
together according to different criteria. For each
individual unit there may be a set of processing
operations which must be carried out, this depending on
many different variables. In a situation where there is
a large number of variables and complex processing is
required in addition to there being a large amount of
data, unless extremely expensive computer systems (such as
massively parallel systems) are used the response time
would be inadequate using presently available data
processing apparatus.The invention is directed towards providing a construction
of data processing apparatus which provides the above-mentioned
technical results without the need for a very
powerful and expensive computer installation. An
important point is that the invention relates to the
technical steps which are carried out to achieve these
technical

<CLAIMS>
A data processing apparatus comprising a user
interface, a central processing unit (2) connected

to a storage device (4) and to a random access
memory (3), characterized in that the central

processing unit (2) comprising means for :-

(a) receiving at the user interface an instruction for
output of data, the instruction including names of

data files within a hierarchical structure (20) in
the storage device of linked group (21), sub-group

(22), status (24) and unit (25) files, the
structure also comprising category files (23)

linked to upper and lower level data files and
wherein each category file (23) has a set of codes

in which:-

each code is linked with at least one unit
file (25);
there are a plurality of sub-sets of codes,
each sub-set being linked with a status file

(24); and
all codes are linked with all higher-level
data files (21,22) linked to the category

file (23) in the structure;
(b) retrieving a category file (23) linked to the data
files addressed in the instructions;
(c) writing the category file (23) to a category array
structure (40) in the memory (3) having a row and

column capacity corresponding to the codes of the
category files (23); 
(d) determining by way of the addressed data files and
the manner of their being linked to the category

file (23) relevant codes in the category array
structure (40), and for each such code in turn
