<ABSTRACT>
The present invention provides a heterojunction bipolar 
a collector layer (3), a base layer (4), an emitter layer (6), 

a transition 
layer (5) formed between the base (4) layer and the emitter 

layer (6), a collector electrode (8) connected to the collector 
layer, a base electrode (9) connected to the base layer, and an 

emitter electrode (10) connected to the emitter layer, wherein 
the emitter layer (6) and the transition layer (5) are formed of a 

composition including elements forming the base layer (4) and at 
least one element different from the elements, a composition 

of the different element in the transition layer at the 
emitter side is substantially equal to that of the emitter 

layer, a composition of the different element in the transition 
layer at the base side is smaller than that of the 

emitter side and varies abruptly towards the base layer, and 
the composition of the transition layer varies in a continuous 

or discontinuous grading from the base side to the 
emitter side.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a heterojunction bipolar
transistor. In particular, it relates to a heterojunction
bipolar transistor in which the material composition of the
emitter-base heterojunction region is graded, thereby resulting
in a high reliability.Conventionally, an AlGaAs/GaAs heterojunction bipolar
transistor is formed using a semi-insulating GaAs substrate,
doped GaAs base and collector layers and a doped AlGaAs
emitter layer. In such a conventional heterojunction bipolar
transistor, the material composition of the emitter-base
junction region is varied to achieve the desired electric
potential barrier. For example, in a device having an
emitter-base junction region of which the composition is
graded linearly or parabolically, the aluminum content is
varied in the emitter-base junction region, namely a transition
layer is provided between the emitter layer and base 
layer as shown by a broken line A in Figure 4. In the case
of a device having an emitter-base junction region of which
the composition is graded abruptly, the aluminum content is
varied as shown by a solid line B.Hereinafter, the conventional NPN-type device having an
emitter-base junction region of which the composition is
graded linearly or abruptly is described in detail with
reference to figures. Herein, the term "a grading or abrupt
emitter-base junction region" refers to the emitter-base
junction region which includes the emitter, transition and
base layers and of which the composition is graded linearly,
graded parabolically or changes abruptly.Fig. 5 shows a bipolar transistor having an emitter-base
junction region in which the aluminum composition is
graded linearly. The bipolar transistor of Fig. 5 has the
following layers sequentially formed on a semi-insulating
GaAs substrate 31: n+-GaAs layer 32, n-GaAs layer 33, p+-GaAs
layer 34, n-AlXGa1-XAs layer 35 (0≤X≤0.3), n-Al0.3Ga0.7As
layer 36 and n+-GaAs layer 37. A collector
electrode 38 is formed on n+-GaAs layer 32. A base electrode
39 is formed on p+-GaAs layer 34. An emitter electrode
40 is formed on n+-GaAs layer 37.Fig. 6 shows an energy band of the above described
bipolar transistor of Fig. 5 in which the emitter-base 
junction region has a linearly graded aluminum composition.
In the bipolar transistor with the graded emitter-base junction
region, a barrier between the emitter and base is
released owing to the emitter-base junction region of which
the composition is graded linearly or parabolically. In
that case, the injected electron density is varied in accordance
