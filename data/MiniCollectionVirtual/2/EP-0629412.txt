<ABSTRACT>
An artificial heart has a driving section (5) and a 
pump section (4), and a sealing section (31) forming a 

seal for a driving shaft extending from the driving section 
(5) for driving the pump section (4). A sealing 

liquid chamber (30) filled with a sealing liquid is 
formed around the driving shaft (26) between the sealing 

mechanism (31) and the driving section (5). The sealing 
liquid in the sealing liquid chamber (30) maintains the 

sealing mechanism (31) in a liquid-tight state and 
lubricates the sealing mechanism (31), whereby blood is 

prevented from entering the driving section (5). Even 
if blood happens to enter the sealing liquid chamber 

(30), the blood is mixed with the sealing liquid and 
does not coagulate. Thus, the operation of the artificial 

heart is not suppressed.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to an artificial heart, and
more particularly an auxiliary artificial heart of an
embedded type, embedded in the left or right ventricle
of the heart in a human body, and operated at high
reliability by preventing body fluids such as blood from
adversely entering the artificial heart.Conventional artificial hearts are of a diaphragm
type, of a sack type, of an axially symmetric type, of a
centrifugal type, of a pusher plate type or the like.
Each of these conventional artificial hearts delivers
blood in place of a human heart or by bypassing it.Recently, there has been developed an auxiliary
artificial heart which is embedded in a ventricle of a
human heart and has the tip end of a nozzle passing
through an aorta valve or the like such that blood is
delivered from the ventricle into an aorta through the
nozzle. The artificial heart has such a structure that
it does not suppress any function of the human heart
when it is provided in the human heart and it delivers
additional blood into the aorta when blood pumped out
from the human heart due to its beats is insufficient.
The blood is delivered not only by the artificial heart
but also by the pulsing human heart due to its beats.
Even if the operation of the artificial heart happens to
stop, blood is delivered by the human heart due to its
beats. Naturally, the volume of the part of the artificial
heart which is inserted in a ventricle of the human
heart must be smaller than the volume of the human heart
when it is contracted most. Such an artificial heart
has a pump body comprising a cylindrical axial-flow pump
section, a nozzle section provided on its distal end and
a driving section provided on the proximal end of the
axial-flow pump section. The cardiac apex of a
ventricle of a human heart is cut and a short cylindrical
cardiac apex ring is embedded therein. The pump
section and the nozzle section are inserted in the
ventricle through the cardiac apex ring, and the distal
end of the nozzle section is inserted in an aorta
through its aorta valve or the like. The driving section
which has a large volume is embedded in a portion
of the thorax which is outside of the human heart.The artificial heart has the following problem in
connection with the function of a shaft-sealing mechanism
provided between the pump section and the driving section.
With the artificial heart, a motor and other elements
are housed in the driving section, and the rotor
of the pump section is driven via driving shaft
extending from the driving section to the
