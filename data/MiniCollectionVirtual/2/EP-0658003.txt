<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to an optoelectronic 
apparatus and a method for receiving optical signals. In 
particular, the present invention relates to an optical 
receiver which utilizes a photoconductor to reset an input 
stage field-effect transistor before an optical input beam 
is received. Optical receivers are illuminated with optical 
input beams and respond by generating either optical or 
electrical output signals. These receivers are now being 
fabricated as the input stages of very large scale 
integrated (VLSI) circuits on semiconductor chips for use in 
communications equipment, and thus their performance 
characteristics must be improved. A typical prior art optical receiver circuit has 
a detector stage comprising two photo-diodes connected in 
series having a first electrical node between them, and an 
input stage comprising two field-effect transistors (FETs), 
a load FET and an input FET, connected in series. The gate 
input of the input FET is connected to the first electrical 
node. The output of the receiver circuit is taken from a 
second electrical node located between the FETs. A first 
optical input beam incident on the first photo-diode causes 
a first logic level output to be generated, and a 
complementary optical input beam alternately incident on the 
second photo-diode causes a second logic level output to be 
generated. One problem that arises in VLSI circuit arrays is 
controlling the allowed voltages and voltage swings that are 
present at such optical receivers. If these voltages are  
 
not controlled, the input light beams must have large 
optical energies to ensure sufficient voltage swings to 
switch the input FET to the desired state. One approach for 
controlling the voltage swing is to use clamping diodes at 
the detector stage. However, additional clamping diode 
voltages are then required, which complicates system design 
since two additional voltage power supplies for each 
receiver circuit are then typically needed. Further, the clamping diode voltages must be 
carefully set relative to the local voltage levels of the 
circuit. These local voltages may vary from place to place 
on a semiconductor chip. Therefore, maintaining optimum 
clamping conditions across an entire chip may be difficult. Yet further, the input FET threshold must be 
considered when setting the clamping diode voltages. Since 
threshold variations may exist across a chip or between 
chips, and since different chips may require different 
voltages, system design is further complicated. The
