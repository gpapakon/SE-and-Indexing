<ABSTRACT>
A device for controlling the voltage drop across an appliance, particularly an electromagnetic appliance, is described. The appliance and a controlling element are connected in series between earth and supply voltage. First means provide an actual current which corresponds to the voltage present across the appliance. Second means define a nominal current. Control means define a quantity to be applied to the controlling element in dependence on a comparison of the actual current with the nominal current.

<CLAIMS>
Apparatus for controlling a voltage which is
dropped across a load (100), in which the load (100)

and a control element (110) are connected in series
between earth and the supply voltage, 
characterized by

first means (421, 422, 410) which convert the potential
values across the load (100) into current values and

form an actual current which corresponds to the
difference between the two converted current values,

having a second means (450) for presetting a nominal
current, and having control means (400) which preset a

control variable, in order to act on the control
element, depending on a comparison of the actual

current and the nominal current.
Apparatus according to Claim 1, 
characterized
in that
 the first means comprise at least one current
mirror which produces a current which corresponds to

the voltage dropped across the load.
Apparatus according to Claim 1 or 2,

characterized in that
 the control means comprise at
least one current mirror.
Apparatus according to one of the preceding
claims, 
characterized in that
 the difference between
the actual current and the nominal current is applied

to the control element.
Apparatus according to one of the preceding
claims, 
characterized in that
 a field-effect transistor
is used as the control element. 
Apparatus according to one of the preceding
claims, 
characterized in that
 the load is a solenoid
valve for determining the amount of fuel injected into

an internal combustion engine, and the apparatus is
used for determining a variable which characterizes the

start of injection and/or the end of injection.
