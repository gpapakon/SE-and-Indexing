<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a solid
electrolyte for use in solid electrochemical elements
including a solid cell, and more particularly to a
lithium ion conductive solid electrolyte whose ion
conductive species is lithium ion, and a process for
synthesizing the same.With recent development of portable appliances
such as personal computers, portable telephones, etc., a
demand for cells as their power source has been
considerably increased. Particularly, lithium cells
have been extensively studied in various fields as cells
capable of giving a high energy density, because lithium
is a substance having a small atomic weight and a large
ionization energy.On the other hand, the cells so far used in
these fields are based substantially on a liquid
electrolyte and thus it has been impossible to eliminate
such problems as leakage of liquid electrolyte, etc. To
solve these problems, thereby enhancing the reliability
and also to make the elements smaller and thinner,
attempts for replacing the liquid electrolyte with a
solid electrolyte and making an entirely solid cell have 
been extensively made in various fields.The above-mentioned lithium, when brought into
an abnormal state, has a fear of ignition due to the
high energy density. Thus, development of an entirely
solid lithium cell using a solid electrolyte made from a
non-combustible solid has been desired to ensure the
safety of the cell. Lithium halide, lithium nitride,
oxy acid salts of lithium, and their derivatives are
known as solid electrolytes for use in such a cell.
Lithium ion conductive sulfide-based amorphous solid
electrolytes such as Li2S-SiS2, Li2S-P2S5, Li2S-B2S3, etc.
are known as solid electrolytes having a particularly
high ion conductivity such as more than 10-4 S/cm.Ion conductivity of a solid electrolyte, when
made into a cell, gives an influence on the internal
impedance. For example, a solid cell made from a solid
electrolyte having a high ion conductivity has a lower
internal impedance than that from a solid electrolyte
having a low ion conductivity, and thus can work (i.e.
can be charged or discharged) with a larger quantity of
electric current. Thus, attempts to increase the ion
conductivity have been extensively made in various
fields, and it was reported that the above-mentioned
sulfide-based solid electrolyte had a high ion conductivity
such as 1 x 10-3 S/cm, when doped with LiI.However, the sulfide-based solid electrolyte
having an increased ion conductivity by doping with LiI
still has the following problem. That is,
