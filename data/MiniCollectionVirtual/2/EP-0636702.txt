<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method for
producing a transparent conductive film, whereby a
transparent conductive film useful for e.g. a transparent
electrode film for a liquid crystal display, a plasma
display, an EL display, a touch panel or an anti-fogging
glass for vehicles, or an optical thin film useful for a
building window having various optical properties, is
formed by sputtering.The present invention also relates to a method for
forming a silicon oxide film having an alkali barrier
property or a silicon nitride film having various
functions.As a method for forming the above transparent
conductive film, there has been proposed a chemical film-forming
method such as a sol-gel coating method, a
spraying method or a chemical vapor deposition (CVD)
method, or a physical film-forming method such as a
vacuum deposition method or a sputtering method. However, for the industrial production of such
transparent electrode films, the physical film-forming
method such as a vacuum evaporation method or a
sputtering method has been mainly employed for the reason
that a transparent conductive film excellent in
electrical properties and optical properties can thereby
be readily obtained. Especially, in recent years, the
sputtering method has been widely used for the reason
that a film can be formed uniformly on a substrate having
a large area, and yet the film can be constantly formed
even on a relatively low temperature substrate.The sputtering method is a film-forming method,
wherein argon gas is ionized by direct current (DC)
discharge or radio frequency (RF) discharge and bombarded
to a negatively biased metal or oxide target, and the
substance sputtered from the target is precipitated on a
substrate.For example, when a tin oxide film is to be formed,
tin oxide containing from 0.1 to 10 wt% of antimony or a
tin alloy containing from 0.1 to 10 wt% of antimony may
be used as the target material.Likewise, when an ITO film is to be formed, indium
oxide containing from 5 to 10 wt% of tin oxide (ITO
target) or an indium-tin alloy containing from 5 to 10
wt% of tin (IT target) may, for example, be used as the
target material.Likewise, when a zinc oxide film is to be formed, 
zinc-oxide containing from 0.1 to 10 wt% of aluminum,
zinc oxide containing from 0.1 to 15 wt% of gallium, a
zinc alloy containing from 0.1 to 10 wt% of aluminum, or
a zinc alloy containing from 0.1 to 15 wt% of gallium,
may, for example, be used as the target material.As the sputtering gas, an inert gas such as argon,
which may contain
