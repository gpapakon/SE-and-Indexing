<ABSTRACT>
Method for processing signals, in particular for treating 
audio signals, characterized in that it mainly consists 

in the supply of an input signal (3) to be treated; in 
the isolation of a number of signals (5) from the input 

signal (3) which are mainly situated in a predetermined 
part of the sound range; in the additional generation of 

higher harmonics on the basis of the isolated signals 
(5); and in the formation of an output signal (9) by 

combining the signal (7) which contains the generated 
higher harmonics with at least part of the above-mentioned 

input signal (3), whereby this input signal (3) 
was either or not treated before being combined.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention concerns a method and device for
processing signals.In particular, it concerns a method and device for
processing audio signals, particularly in order to
improve the sound quality and/or to create special
effects.It is known that audio signals can be subject to
different types of interferences. An important type of
interference hereby is noise. Moreover, various other
types of interferences may occur such as distortions
which have a negative effect on the sound clarity.The present invention concerns a method and device for
processing signals which makes it possible to
significantly improve the sound quality of audio signals,
irrespective of the source of the signal to be improved. A known manner for improvement is disclosed in document
JP-A-02 311006. The present invention aims a further
improvement.To this end the invention concerns a method for processing
signals, in particular for treating audio signals, whereby
an input signal is subjected to a treatment, and whereby
said treatment comprises the steps of isolating signals
from the input signal, said signals forming a portion of
the input signal, which portion represents a predetermined
part of the sound frequency range; of forming a signal by
generating higher harmonics on the basis of the isolated
signals; and of forming an output signal by combining the
signal which contains the generated higher harmonics with
at least part of said input signal, whereby this input
signal was either or not treated before being combined,
whereby this method is characterized in that the passage of
the signal comprising the generated higher harmonics is
controlled as a function of the input signal.According to a preferred embodiment, in order to produce
the signal on the basis of which the higher harmonics are
generated, the tones the frequency of which exceed a certain
value are 
isolated and transmitted. The pass limit, in other words
the frequency as of which the tones are allowed to pass,
is preferably situated between 3000 and 5000 Hz, and
better still at about 3 500 Hz.Moreover, it is preferable that only those tones the frequency of which
is situated under a cert in value are isolated, in other
words that the tones the frequency of which is situated above said value
are eliminated or at least considerably abated. The pass
limit, in this case the limit above which the tones are
eliminated or considerably abated, is preferably situated
between 4 000 and 19 000 Hz and better still at about
7 000 Hz.According to a special embodiment of the
