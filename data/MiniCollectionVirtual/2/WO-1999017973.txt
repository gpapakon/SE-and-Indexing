<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to an electronically controllable brake booster (21) comprising a vacuum chamber (23) and a pressure chamber (24) which are separated from one another by a movable wall (22). The invention also comprises a control valve assembly which can be actuated by an electromagnetic actuating device (26) and can be adjusted by a pressure differential between the pressure and vacuum chambers. According to a current flowing through the electromagnetic actuating device, the control valve assembly occupies a stopping position in which the current lies in a region between a higher value and a lower value such that the control valve assembly does not abandon the stopping position. Said control valve assembly also occupies a first pressure change position in which the current is greater than the higher value and a second pressure change position in which the current is less than the lower value. According to the invention, a characteristic value is detected for the actual march of pressure in the pressure chamber. The actual march of pressure is examined on the existing periodic vibration components of a predetermined frequency band with a predetermined minimum amplitude. During the existence of such periodic vibration components of the predetermined frequency band, the current is reduced to a predetermined value for the first pressure change position and the current is increased to a predetermined value for the second pressure change position.
