<ABSTRACT>
An intermodal transportation system for hauling bulk materials, particularly municipal solid waste, by rail and truck utilizes multiple rectangular, open-top boxes (12) each having a removable lid (16). The system includes a forklift (20) with an articulated frame (46, 50, 54) actuated by hydraulics which engages channels (18) formed in the box (12) or in the lid (16). Lock bars (26) on the box (12) are clamped by locking members (72) carried on the forklift (20) to hold the box on the forks (22) during an over-the-side dumping movement. The forklift (20) empties the box (12) with a roll-out motion combining a forward rotation of a lifted box (12) with a backward movement of the box (12). A reinforced flatbed railcar (10) receives up to four 21 foot long boxes (12) and lids (16) with a total carrying capacity of up to 100 tons. Each car contains upright corners (14) that guide the boxes onto the railroad car and then restrain it. The containers are flush with the upper surface of the railroad car when engaged in the corners. A tractor trailer (86) with a tilt-up roller bed (84) and winch hauls the boxes on highways.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates in general to
transportation systems and in particular to an
intermodal railway system utilizing closed
containers to carry bulk materials, particularly
municipal solid waste, by truck and rail.The disposal of municipal solid waste (MSW)
such as common garbage and trash as well as sludge
produced by water treatment facilities is becoming
an increasingly important and difficult problem as
landfilled sites convenient to urban centers are
becoming full and environmental protection concerns
are foreclosing the ocean dumping of solid refuse.
At present, the most common MSW disposal system is
to simply haul the MSW by tractor (transfer) trailer
from an urban collection point or treatment plant to
a landfill. Given the capital cost of a "transfer
trailer" and typical current operating costs per
mile for a typical 22 ton load, currently there is
approximately a 300 mile one way haul distance limit
on economically feasible disposal sites.Because the tonnage that can be hauled by
truck in a single load is limited by highway and
bridge laws, the cost of transporting bulk waste by
truck is inherently limited as to its volume and
weight. While railroads can carry larger loads,
measured both in volume and in weight, over long 
distances, to date efforts to use railway cars for
hauling low value bulk materials, particularly loose
MSW, has proven to be financially uneconomical. At
present there is substantially no use of railroads
to haul municipal solid waste. Indeed, at present
the maximum payload that is carried by any standard
railway car is about 60 tons, regardless of the type
of car or the nature of its load.One known approach to utilizing railroads
for bulk transportation is a convertible trailer
which has detachable rail wheels and specialized
interconnections so that the highway trailer can be
converted into a railroad car. An example of this
type of unit is a product sold by the Thrall Car
Company under the trade designation "Roadrailer".
While the system has found some market for hauling
high value items, it is not economical for
transportation of bulk materials. The detachable
wheels and special interconnection systems to
convert the "transfer trailer" into a "railroad car"
significantly increases the capital cost of each
unit required to transport a given weight, e.g., the
22 tons normally carried by a "transfer trailer"
when hauling MSW. Also, the converted "cars" do not
operate in conjunction with existing railroad
service; they must operate as a complete train and
there is

<CLAIMS>
A system for transporting bulk materials comprising

a flatbed railway car (10) extending in a first direction
a plurality of boxes (12) carried on said flatbed railway car (10)
that can hold tons of the bulk material, said boxes (12) having a bottom

(12a) and four side walls (12b,12c) which define an interior therein and
which are formed of a high strength, rigid structural material;

characterised in that said boxes (12) are interconnected with one another
to form an open top container (12), said bottom (12a) being substantially

flush with the flatbed of said railway car (14) and there is provided
passive restraint means (14) secured to the flatbed of said railway
car (10) for locating and securing said boxes (12) on said railway car

(10),
a plurality of replaceable lids (16) each adapted to seat on and
enclose the open tops of an associated one of said boxes (12), said lids

(16) each being formed of a rigid structural material,
at least one horizontal double open-ended channel (18) formed in
said box (12) adjacent said bottom wall (12a) and extending transversely

with respect to said first direction between first and second of said side
walls (12b,12b),
a tractor (20) for carrying and dumping said boxes (12) and
manipulating said lids (16) including (i) at least one fork (22) that engages

said channel (18), (ii) an articulated frame mounted on one end of said
tractor (20) that mounts said forks (22), and (iii) hydraulic actuator means

to drive said articulated frame to lift and rotate the forks (22), in co-ordination
with a movement of said forks (22) toward said tractor (20) to

dump the bulk material from the box (12) with a forward roll-out motion
that produces a downward and rearward travel arc of said fork (22) while

stabilizing the combined weight of the tractor (20) and said box (122)
carried on said fork (22),
