<ABSTRACT>
Process for the transmission of heat energy, in which one or more sealed cylinders turn on bearings by means of the action of a motor, the cylinder(s) having a tubular shaft capable of receiving a body which is capable of heat exchange with a gaseous fluid situated close to the latter inside the cylinder, this gaseous fluid being capable, with the centrifugal acceleration of said cylinder, of increasing the speed and the temperature of its molecules in the direction of the periphery of this cylinder, being capable of bringing about in said zone a heat exchange with another body external to the cylinder by virtue of the temperature gradient which is caused along the radius thereof as a result of the centrifugal acceleration which is transmitted to the molecules of the gaseous fluid with a minimum energy supply.
