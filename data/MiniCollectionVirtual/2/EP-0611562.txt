<ABSTRACT>
A digital tampon (20) for feminine hygiene, 
having a round dome (33) and a recovery tape (24), 

consists of a blank which is shaped by winding up a 
length of continuous random fibre web and which is 

pressed to produce a preform having a fibre core, 
longitudinal ribs and longitudinal grooves. The 

longitudinal ribs are subsequently lightly pressed to the final shape 
of the tampon (20; 28). The preform, before being 

pressed to the final shape of the tampon (20), is 
shaped as a result of the separate, but simultaneous 

radial pressing of directly adjacent sectors of its 
entire circumferential surface to form a longitudinal 

groove and a longitudinal rib respectively on each 
sector of the circumferential surface. 

The fibre material is pressed radially to a lesser extent in the 
region of the end (22) provided with the recovery tape 

(24). The invention also relates to an 
apparatus for producing the tampon.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a digital tampon for
feminine hygiene in accordance with the preamble of
claim 1, to a process for producing such a tampon in
accordance with the preamble of claim 5 and to an
apparatus in accordance with the preamble of claim 14.Tampons of this generic type are known from
DE 3,934,153 C2. They are, as a rule, packaged individually
and are introduced into the body cavity by hand,
without an introduction aid. In the proper position or
even in any position, the recovery tape bears against
the recovery end of the tampon or has been pressed
into this. After the individual pack has been opened,
therefore, the recovery tape first has to be detached
from the recovery end of the tampon, before the digital
tampon can be introduced. This detachment of the
recovery tape from the recovery end of the tampon
becomes a troublesome manipulation when the recovery
tape is anchored to a greater or lesser depth or
firmly in the pressed fibre composite of the tampon during
its production. There is provided for producing this
tampon a so-called progressive press, in which two different
groups of press jaws press the tampon in succession
to produce a preform, before the latter is
subsequently brought to the final shape of the finished
tampon in a die. This progressive pressing causes an
expansion of the tampon which is similar to the shape of
a quadrangle and as a result of which it is not always
possible to prevent some risk of leakage when the tampon
is employed. The tampon necessitates the use of a
relatively large amount of material, by means of which a
high stability or buckling strength of the tampon desired
for digital tampons is achieved. However, this advantage
is afforded at the expense of a lower activatability of the
fibre material, compacted in the axial fibre core of the
tampon, by fluid coming into contact with this fibre material,
thus contributing, in conjunction with a heating of
the fibre material during the pressing of the latter, to an
impairment of the absorbency and speed of absorption.Once the recovery tape has been detached
from the recovery end of the tampon before the introduction
of the latter, the tampon, after being inserted
into the body cavity, is introduced into the body cavity
completely by means of a finger by the exertion of pressure
on the recovery end of the tampon. This complete
introduction of the tampon can also present difficulties,
because a finger can slip off from the recovery end of
the tampon as a result of deficient guidance. Moreover,
relatively firm
