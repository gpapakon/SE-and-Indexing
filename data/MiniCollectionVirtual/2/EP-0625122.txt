<ABSTRACT>
The device proposed has a first conveyor element (1) with a gap (11) in it into which the front end of a second conveyor element (2) engages. The second conveyor element (2) conveys the printed matter at an angle to the first conveyor element and has a lower and an upper extraction belt (13, 14). The front end of the upper extraction belt (14) is telescopically adjustable.

Device for conveying and separating folded printed products 
(A, B) supplied in an overlapping stream (S) on a conveyor, 

at least two printed products (A, B) being laterally offset 
from one another and respective conveyor elements (1, 2) 

being arranged laterally of the overlapping stream (S) and 
the conveyor elements (1, 2) diverging and drawing the 

printed products (A, B) apart, characterised in that the 
first conveyor element (1) has a gap (11) in which the 

second conveyor element (2) engages via its front end and 
this second conveyor element (2) conveys the printed 

products obliquely relative to the first conveyor element 
(1) and has a lower delivery belt (13) and an upper 

delivery belt (14) and that the upper delivery belt (14) is 
telescopically adjustable at its front end in the conveying 

direction of the second conveyor element (2). 
Device according to claim 1, characterised in that the 
first conveyor element (1) has a clamping bar (21) and a 

plurality of parallel belt sections (8) laterally alongside 
the latter. 
Device according to claim 2, characterised in that the belt 
sections (8, 10) are interrupted in their longitudinal 

direction in order to form the gap (11). 
Device according to claim 3, characterised in that the 
interruption is greater as the distance from the clamping 

bar (21) increases. 
Device according to one of claims 1 to 4, characterised in 
that the second conveyor element (2) has a plurality of 

parallel belt sections, at least two belt sections (13a) of  
 

the lower delivery belt (13) cooperating with two belt 
sections (14a) of the upper delivery belt (14). 
Device according to one of claims 1 to 5, characterised in 
that the second conveyor element (2) conveys the printed 

products at substantially the same speed as the first 
conveyor element (1) in the direction of the first conveyor 

element (1). 
Device according to one of claims 1 to 6, characterised in 
that the lower delivery belt (13) has two parallel belt 

sections (13a) arranged alongside one another for drawing 
apart printed products (B) from the overlappinq stream (S) 

and that further belt sections (13b, 13c) are arranged 
alongside these belt sections (13a) as supports for the 

printed products (B) to be drawn apart. 
Device according to one of claims 1 to 7, characterised in 
that the support of the second conveyor element (2) is 

arranged slightly below the support of the first conveyor 
element (1). 
Device according to one of claims 1 to 8, characterised in 
that the second conveyor element (2) extends at an acute 

angle and preferably substantially at an angle of 45Â° 
relative to the first conveyor element (1). 
Device according to one of claims 1 to 9, characterised in 

that the first conveyor element (1) conveys the printed 
products in a rectilinear manner upstream and downstream of 

the gap (11).
