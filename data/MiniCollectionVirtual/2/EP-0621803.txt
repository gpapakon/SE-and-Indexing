<ABSTRACT>
Assay apparatus comprises a first assay zone constituted by a foam pad (26) on a first solid support component (10) constituted by a plastics card having a channel (14) on one face thereof bordered by undercut walls (12) receiving a plastics slide (18) as a second solid support component having as a second assay zone a window (24). The support components fit together for relative sliding movement such that said zones are slidable with respect to one another from a first position in which said zones are separated from one another to a position in which said zones are brought into mutual contact by sliding motion. An antibody may be bound to the foam pad. An enzyme antibody conjugate may be unbound on the pad. An assay reagent which takes part in an observable reaction with the conjugate or a species to be assayed is present beneath window (24).

<DESCRIPTION>
 ASSAY APPARATUS AND METHODThe present invention relates to assay apparatus and a method of assay and has particular but not exclusive relevance to immuno-diagnostic assays.Diagnostic tests based on the specificity of antibodies (e.g. monoclonal antibodies) and DNA technology are continually being developed and provide means for the identification of undesirable infections (bacterial, fungal or viral), or chemical entities, thus facilitating appropriate treatments.In addition to improvements in the chemistry of diagnostic tests, there has been considerable development in the way in which the tests are formatted. Initially, most diagnostic tests.were conducted in the laboratory due to the constraints imposed by the requirement for equipment, materials and trained operators. There have however been significant developments in format design which allow tests to be carried out in relatively short timescales, e.g. ten minutes or less, whilst requiring minimal input in terms of manual manipulations and operator skill.Current immuno-diagnostic tests rely on multi-step processes requiring several manipulations and reasonably accurate timing of the steps. This is a major disadvantage in tests for use outside the laboratory such as in doctors surgeries, in the field or in the home. In these circumstances, test procedures may not be followed very accurately by the end user. Although some test kits currently available do not require many steps, they tend to be expensive as the technology needed to achieve these requirements is inherently expensive. There is therefore a need for a simpler device reducing manufacturing costs whilst maintaining simplicity of operation. The present invention provides assay apparatus comprising a first assay zone on a first solid support component for 

capturing a species to be assayed thereon and a second assay zone on a second solid support component having an assay reagent thereon, means mounting said first and second solid support components together for relative slidingmovement such that said zones are slidable with respect to one another from a first position in which said zones are separated from one another to a position in which said zones are brought into mutual contact by sliding motion.The first and second support components may be different parts of a single member or may be separate members mounted together. For instance, a single strip may be folded over to bring to end portions together and means may be provided to hold the end portions face to face whilst allowing
