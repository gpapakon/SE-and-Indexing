<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a method of making heat-insulating material from silicate-containing (siliceous) material, calcium hydroxide (hydrated lime, slaked lime), water, foam and a rapid-setting cement containing reactive aluminates, from which there is produced a castable raw mixture which is cast into moulds, with the green bodies formed in the moulds being removed from the moulds after sufficient setting and autoclaved. To achieve very low bulk densities, it is provided for the silicate-containing material used to be a quartz flour having a specific surface area by BET of at least about 3 m

Method of making a heat-insulating material from material 
containing silicate, calcium hydroxide, water, foam and a fast-setting 

cement containing reactive aluminates, from which is made 
a raw mixture capable of being poured, which is poured into 

moulds, the blanks formed in the moulds being released after 
sufficient solidification and autoclaved, characterised in that 

as the material containing silicate, a quartz powder with a 
specific surface according to BET of at least 3 m

a weight ratio of water/solid (without foam) of at least 1.25 to 
approximately 1.85 and a substantially stoichiometric quantity 

of calcium hydroxide with respect to the practically complete 
transformation of the quartz powder and of the reactive 

aluminates, with a surface according to BET of at least 15 m
