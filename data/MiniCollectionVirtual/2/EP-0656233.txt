<ABSTRACT>
The present invention provides a return system for 
processing returned packagings, comprising: 


one or more packagings provided with identification 
means; and 
recognition means for recognizing the 
identification means on the packagings. 
In the case the packaging has environmentally contaminating 
contents such as paint or glue, the return system 

also comprises an inner packaging so that the (outer) 
packaging is returned clean. The inner packaging can then 

preferably comprise a tapering portion so that when the 
inner packaging is disposed of as waste as little material 

as possible with an environmental impact remains behind 
therein.

<DESCRIPTION>
Manufacturers of packagings, or their customers, 
are being compelled to an increasing extent to take back the 
packagings from the users thereof and re-use them as much as 
possible, or to ensure processing with as little unnecessary 
waste as possible. In a competitive market with different 
manufacturers of packagings, collection of the used 
packagings will present a great problem. The present invention provides a return system for 
processing returned packagings, comprising: 
one or more packagings provided with identification 
means; and recognition means for recognizing the 
identification means on the packagings. In the case the packaging has environmentally contaminating 
contents such as paint or glue, the return system 
also comprises an inner packaging so that the (outer) 
packaging is returned clean. The inner packaging can then 
preferably comprise a tapering portion so that when the 
inner packaging is disposed of as waste, as little material 
as possible with an environmental impact remains behind 
therein. The present invention further provides a packaging 
in the form of a container on which identification means are 
arranged, and an inner packaging in the form of a bag of 
plastic material and provided with a tapering portion on the 
underside thereof. Further advantages, features and details of the 
present invention will become apparent in the light of the 
following description with reference to the annexed 
drawings, in which: 
fig. 1 shows a partly cut away view in perspective 
of an embodiment of a packaging according to the present 
invention;  fig. 2 shows a view in perspective of the 
packaging of fig. 1 in opened situation; fig. 3 shows detail III of fig. 1; fig. 4 is a schematic view of use of the inner 
packaging of the embodiment shown in fig. 1 and 2; and fig. 5 is a schematic view in perspective of an 
embodiment of a return system according to the present 
invention. A packaging 1 (fig. 1) comprises an outer 
packaging 3 (also known as a container pack), preferably in 
the form of a bucket or pail of plastic, for instance high 
density polyethylene, and a cover 2 placed thereon which is 
preferably formed from a slightly flexible plastic, for 
instance lower density polyethylene, so that an outside edge 
7 thereof is movable from a hermetically closable position 
against a rim 4 on the outer wall 5 of the pail in order to 
open the packaging (fig. 2). The packaging 1 preferably also comprises an inner 
packaging 12 (fig. 2, 4) in the form of a bag 6 of plastic 
foil in
