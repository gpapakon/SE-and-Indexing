<ABSTRACT>
Methyl tertiary butyl ether (MTBE) is formed by 
reaction of methanol with tertiary butyl ether in two catalyst 

beds. A feedstock mixture comprising methanol and tertiary 
butyl alcohol in a molar ratio of 2 to 3 moles of methanol per 

mole of tertiary butyl alcohol is reacted in a first 
etherification reaction zone at a liquid hourly space velocity 

of 1 to 10 volumes of feedstock mixture per volume of catalyst 
per hour. A first reaction product mixture is fractionated to 

remove unreacted methanol, isobutylene and MTBE overhead. 
This isobutylene is passed to a second etherification reaction 

zone at a liquid hourly space velocity of 1 to 10. A second 
reaction product mixture is fractionated to recover additional 

MTBE.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a process for the 
manufacture and purification of methyl tertiary butyl ether. 
More particularly, the invention relates to a process for the 
reaction of tertiary butyl alcohol with methanol and 
purification of the methyl tertiary butyl ether containing 
reaction product mixture formed by the reaction. Concern for environmental pollution and human health 
disorders caused by lead from exhaust gases of internal 
combustion engines has motivated a reformulation of automobile 
gasoline to remove lead containing compounds. In order to 
make an unleaded gasoline of the same octane number, high 
octane oxygenated hydrocarbon compounds have been substituted 
for tetraethyl lead in the automobile gasoline formula. A number of oxygenated hydrocarbon compounds are 
known to have high octane numbers. In particular, methyl 
t-butyl ether (MTBE), ethyl t-butyl ether (ETBE), isopropyl 
t-butyl ether, t-amyl methyl ether (TAME) and t-butyl alcohol 
(tBA) are used commercially to increase the octane number of 
automobile gasoline. The preparation of these ethers by the 
catalytic addition of an alcohol to an olefin having a double 
bond adjacent a tertiary carbon atom has been extensively  
 
studied. Macroreticular acid resin catalysts are Preferred 
catalysts for the process. US-A-5243091 teaches 
a method for preparing methyl tertiary butyl ether from 
methanol and tertiary butyl alcohol. Isobutylene is used 
downstream of the etherification reaction zone as an 
extractant in the purification of methyl tertiary butyl ether. 
Isobutylene is also reacted with methanol to yield additional 
methyl tertiary butyl ether. There is a need for a process which provides a high 
recovery level of MTBE in comparison to the prior art which is 
simple to perform. In the present invention, tertiary butyl alcohol is 
reacted with methanol to produce methyl tertiary butyl ether. 
The reaction is carried out in two catalytic reaction zones. The feedstock comprises a mixture of methanol and 
tertiary butyl alcohol in a molar ratio of 2 to 3 moles of 
methanol per mole of tertiary butyl alcohol. All of the feedstock is passed to the first reaction 
zone at a liquid hourly space velocity of 1 to 10 volumes of 
feedstock per volume of catalyst per hour. The first reaction 
product mixture is fractionated to yield a first lighter 
distillate fraction comprising isobutylene, methanol and 
methyl tertiary butyl ether and a second heavier distillate 
fraction comprising methanol, tertiary butyl alcohol and 
water.

<CLAIMS>
A process for reacting tertiary 
butyl alcohol with methanol to produce methyl tertiary butyl 

ether comprising the steps of: 

a) passing a feed mixture comprising methanol 
and tertiary butyl alcohol in a molar 

ratio of 2 to 3 moles of methanol per mole 
of tertiary butyl alcohol through a first 

etherification reaction zone containing 
etherification catalyst under 

etherification conditions at a liquid 
hourly space velocity of 1 to 10 volumes 

feed mixture per catalyst volume per hour 
to form a first reaction product mixture 
b) passing the first reaction product mixture 
to a first distillation zone and 

separating into a first lighter distillate 
fraction comprising isobutylene, methanol 

and methyl tertiary butyl ether and a 
second heavier distillate fraction 

comprising methanol, tertiary butyl 
alcohol and water ; 
c) passing the first lighter distillate 
fraction to a second etherification 

reaction zone containing etherification  
 

catalyst under etherification conditions 
at a liquid hourly space velocity of 

1 to 10 volumes feed mixture per catalyst 
volume per hour to form a second reaction 

product mixture ; 
d) separating the second reaction product 
mixture to produce a raffinate comprising 

isobutylene and methyl tertiary butyl 
ether and an extract comprising unreacted 

methanol, tertiary butyl alcohol and 
water. 
A process as claimed in Claim 1, additionally comprising: 

e) passing the raffinate to a second 
distillation zone and separating it 

therein into a third lighter distillation 
fraction comprising isobutylene and water 

and a fourth heavier distillation fraction 
consisting essentially of methyl tertiary 

butyl ether. 
A process as claimed in Claim 1 or Claim 2, 
wherein the second heavier distillation fraction comprises 

less than 1 wt.% methyl tertiary butyl ether.  
 
A process as claimed in any one of Claims 1 to 3, 
wherein step (d) the separating is carried out by solvent 

extraction with water.
