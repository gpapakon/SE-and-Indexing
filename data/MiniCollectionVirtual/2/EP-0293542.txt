<ABSTRACT>
The present invention has for its subject a device facili­
tating the dimensioning of work tables, especially desks, 

and the choice of suitable location of related equipment. 
It makes it possible quickly and conveniently to illust­

rate different layout alternatives. The device comprises 
a number of members,carrying symbols (10, 16, 12, 20, 26), 

each representing one of the implements and at least one 
(9) of them representing the table top (10), said members 

being relatively each other rotatable around a common 
pivot (2), the position of which corresponds to the posi­

tion of a chair for the person working at the table, the 
symbols being all in the same reduction scale and located 

at selected distances from the pivot (2).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention concerns a device for facilitating 
the dimensioning of work tables and the location of re­
lated equipment. More particularly, the subject of the 
invention can be used to demonstrate and/or to determine 
space requirement and alternative locations of working 
equipment, such as apparatus and furniture, to be placed 
on the top of or near a work table, especially a desk. 
The invention is especially useful in connection with 
tables which can be made up of a number of standardized 
sections, or modules, and which have a table-top exhibit­
ing at least one curved side, generally the side nearest 
the person who is to work at the table sitting on a chair 
behind it. The creation of work tables, particularly desks, of the 
type having a table-top with at least one, and often two, 
curved sides has involved a very substantial progress in 
respect of the possibilities to increase the efficient 
working area that can be utilized by a person working at 
the table, generally sitting on a chair behind a concave 
side of the table. It should already here be emphasized 
that the term "working area" as used in this context does 
not only refer to the total area within the direct reach 
of the person but also to the other parts of the table-­
top which he cannot, at least not comfortably, reach in 
his sitting position but which can be used to support 
various types of auxiliary equipment. The extremely rapid 
development of computers and other electronic apparatus  
 
which has taken place during recent years has as one of 
its results made it usual for many groups of staff work­
ing at a desk as compulsory working aids to use viewing 
screen terminals, personal computers and the like. Added 
to this requirement is the remaining need of traditional 
equipment such as binders to be placed on the desk-top. 
The optimum way of satisfying such large space require­
ments is to use a table-top shaped like a portion of a 
ring. Using such a table configuration one can provide 
the large working area in the one or both of the follow­
ing ways. The one possibility is to make the annular table-top 
extend along a great circular sector. While, theoretic­
ally, it is possible to use a completely closed ring 
practical requirements as a rule limit the maximum sector 
angle to about 270°, namely to make it possible for the 
person working at the table comfortably to move to and 
from his chair. The second possibility is to increase the radial dimen­
sion of the table-top. This expedient is based on the 
fac

<CLAIMS>
1. A device for demonstrating and/or determining space 
requirement and alternative locations of working imple­

ments, such as apparatus and pieces of furniture, to be 
positioned on or at the top of a working table, especi­

ally a desk, at least one of the contour lines of the 
top exhibiting non-linear form, preferably the line 

adjacent the chair of a person working at the table, 
characterized in that it comprises a number 

of members (9, 15, 18, 19, 25) carrying symbols (10, 16, 
12, 20, 26) each representing one of the implements and 

at least one (9) of them representing the table top (10), 
said members being relatively each other rotatable around 

a common pivot (2), the position of which corresponds to 
the position of said chair, the symbols being all in the 

same reduction scale and located at selected distances 
from the pivot (2). 
2. A device as claimed in claim 1, character ­
ized in that said members are constituted by transpa­

rent sheets having holes (27) for the pivot (2). 
3. A device as claimed in claims 1 or 2, charac ­
terized in that the member (25) having the working 

chair symbol (26) has an elongate hole (21) traversed by 
the pivot (2) and permitting variation of the radial dis­

tance between the symbol and the pivot (2). 
4. A device as claimed in any of claims 1-3, 
characterized in that the pivot (2) is 

supported by a foot-plate (1). 
5. A device as claimed in claim 4, charac ­
terized in that the top surface of the foot-plate 

(1) has symbols representing the table-top.
