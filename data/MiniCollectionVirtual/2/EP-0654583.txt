<ABSTRACT>
An eccentric fluid displacement sleeve (40',40'') is disclosed 
for use with a measurement-while-drilling instrument (10), to 

convert the instrument for use in different size boreholes. 
The sleeve is made eccentric by either increasing or 

decreasing the thicknesses of 
positioning blades (44',44'',46',46'') 

on the 
periphery of the sleeve, while maintaining the thickness of 

the fluid displacement blade (42',42'') aligned with the 
detectors (14,16).

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a formation evaluation
tool and alternatively to a positioning sleeve for such
a tool. The positioning may be in a borehole, such as
an oil well borehole.Oil well logging has been known for many years and
provides an oil and gas well driller with information about
the particular earth formation being drilled. In one type
of oil well logging, after a well has been drilled, a
probe, or sonde is lowered into the borehole to measure
certain characteristics of the formations through which the
well has passed. The probe hangs on the end of a cable
which gives mechanical support to the sonde and which
provides power to the sonde. The cable also conducts
information up to the surface. Such "wireline"
measurements are made after the drilling has taken place.A wireline sonde usually contains a source which
transmits energy into the formation as well as a suitable
receiver for detecting energy returning from the formation.
The energy can be nuclear, electrical, or acoustic.
Wireline "gamma-gamma" probes, for measuring formation
density, are well known devices incorporating a gamma ray
source and a gamma ray detector. During operation of the
probe, gamma rays emitted from the source enter the
formation to be studied, and interact with the atomic
electrons of the material of the formation by the
photoelectric absorption, by Compton scattering, or by pair
production. In photoelectric absorption and pair
production phenomena, the particular gamma rays involved in
the interaction are consumed in the process. In the Compton scattering process, the involved gamma
ray loses some of its energy and changes its original
direction of travel, the amount of energy loss being
related to the amount of change in direction. Some of the
gamma rays emitted from the source into the formation are
scattered by this process toward the detector. Many of
these rays fail to reach the detector, since their
direction is again changed by a second Compton scattering,
or they are absorbed by the photoelectric absorption
process or the pair production process. The scattered
gamma rays that ultimately reach the detector and interact
with it are counted by the electronic circuitry associated
with the detector.Wireline formation evaluation tools such as the
aforementioned gamma ray density tools have many drawbacks
and disadvantages, including loss of drilling time and the
expense involved in pulling the drillstring so as to enable
the wireline to be lowered into the borehole. In addition,
a substantial mud cake can build

<CLAIMS>
A sleeve for positioning a formation evaluation
instrument radially offset from the centerline of a

borehole to allow use of the instrument in a second
borehole having a second diameter different from a nominal

first diameter of a first borehole for which the instrument
is calibrated, said sleeve comprising:


a generally cylindrical body for receiving the
formation evaluation instrument;
a fluid displacement blade (42) attached to said
body, said fluid displacement blade having a radially

outermost surface for contacting the wall of the second
borehole for displacing fluid from a space between a

detector within the instrument and the wall of the
borehole; and
at least one positioning blade (44,46) attached to
said body, said positioning blade having a radially

outermost surface for contacting the borehole wall to
position said outermost surface of said fluid displacement

blade against the borehole wall;
wherein said fluid displacement blade has a first
radial thickness to which the detector is calibrated; and
wherein said at least one positioning blade has a
second radial thickness different from said first radial

thickness, said second radial thickness being sized to
position said outermost surface of said fluid displacement

blade against the borehole wall, thereby positioning the
cylindrical body eccentrically with respect to the

centerline of the second borehole.

displacement blade projects radially from said body.
A sleeve as claimed in claim 1 or claim 2 wherein
said fluid displacement blade projects outwardly from said

body.

wherein said second radial thickness of said positioning

blade is greater than said first radial thickness of said
fluid displacement blade, adapting the instrument for use

in a second borehole having a second diameter greater than
the nominal first diameter of the first borehole.
A sleeve as claimed in any one of claims 1 to 3
wherein said second radial thickness of said positioning

blade is less than said first radial thickness of said
fluid displacement blade, adapting the instrument for use

in a second borehole having a second diameter less than the

returned by the formation through said window and a sleeve
