<ABSTRACT>
A headlamp mounting arrangement for an automotive 
vehicle comprises a mounting support panel (12) which forms a 

part of the vehicle and a lamp assembly (10) with mounting studs (16) 
extending outwardly from the rear wall thereof through 

first openings (30) in the support panel (12). A lock plate (14) is 
connected to the mounting support panel (12) on the side 

opposite the lamp assembly (10) for sliding movement between a 
first position for preventing withdrawal of the mounting 

studs from the first openings (30) in the mounting support plate 
and a second position for permitting withdrawal of the 

mounting studs (16) from the first openings (30). A latch type 
engagement is provided on the lock plate (14) for preventing 

undesired sliding movement of the lock plate toward the 
second position.

<DESCRIPTION>
The subject invention is directed toward the art
of automotive vehicle headlamps and, more particularly, to
a headlamp mounting arrangement that greatly simplifies
installation and removal of automotive headlamp assemblies.Vehicle headlamps are typically mounted by means
of bolts and nuts or similar threaded fasteners.
Consequently, installation and removal of headlamp
assemblies has generally required the use of tools and has
been time consuming and relatively difficult.Although various types of clip fasteners have
been used in addition to the more standard threaded
fasteners, the clips have often been difficult to use or
have been unsatisfactory for a variety of reasons.
Accordingly, a need exists for an improved system for
mounting vehicle headlamp assemblies.Further, attention is drawn to FR-A-2 662 981 which was used as
a basis for drafting the pre-characterising part of claim 1.The subject invention provides an improved system
which allows the headlamp assembly to be mounted and
removed without the use of tools while providing a rigid
and secure fastening of the headlamp assembly to the
vehicle body panels. In accordance with the subject
invention, a vehicle head lamp mounting arrangement as set forth in claim 1 is provided.
Preferred embodiments are claimed in the dependent claims.
A lamp assembly having a rear
exterior wall with a plurality of mounting studs extending
therefrom is arranged to be releasably joined to the
support panel. The mounting studs each have an outer end
portion with an enlarged head that extends through aligned
first openings in the support panel. A lock plate is 
connected to the mounting support panel on the side of the
mounting support panel opposite the lamp assembly for
sliding movement between a first position for preventing
withdrawal of the mounting studs from the first openings in
the mounting support panel, and a second position for
permitting withdrawal of the mounting studs from the first
openings. Latch means are formed on the lock plate for
limiting undesired sliding movement of the lock plate in a
direction toward the second position.Preferably, and in accordance with a more limited
aspect of the invention, the lock plate includes slotted
portions which engage between the enlarged heads and the
mounting support panel. Additionally, the latch means are
associated with the slotted portions and are arranged to
engage the enlarged head on at least one mounting stud.In accordance with yet another aspect of the
invention, the latch means include a resilient

A vehicle head lamp
mounting arrangement comprising:


a mounting support panel (12) forming a part of
the vehicle, a lamp assembly (10) having a rear exterior wall

with a plurality of mounting studs (16) extending outwardly
therefrom, the studs having an outer end portion with an

enlarged head extending through aligned first openings (30) in
the support panel; characterized by
a lock plate (14) connected to the mounting
support panel (12) on the side of the mounting support panel

opposite the lamp assembly (10) for sliding movement between a
first position for preventing withdrawal of the mounting

studs (16) from the first openings in the mounting support plate
and a second position for permitting withdrawal of the

mounting studs from the first openings; and,
latch means (58, 62) for limiting undesired sliding
movement of the lock plate (14) in a direction toward the second

position.
The lamp mounting arrangement as defined in
claim 1 wherein the lock plate (14) includes slotted portions (54)

which engage between the enlarged heads and the mounting
support panel (12).
The lamp mounting arrangement as defined in
claim 2 wherein the latch means (58, 62) is associated with the

slotted portions (54) and engages an enlarged head (26) on at least
one mounting stud (16).
The lamp mounting arrangement as defined in
claim 3 wherein the latch means comprises a resilient

shoulder (62) adjacent the slotted portions. 
The lamp mounting arrangement as defined in
claim 1 wherein the lock plate (14) is connected to the mounting

support panel (12) by post elements (40) which extend from the lock
plate (14) through second openings (44) formed in the mounting

support panel (12).
The lamp mounting arrangement as defined in
claim 5 wherein the lock plate (14) is formed of plastics

material and the post elements (40) are formed integrally
therewith.
The lamp mounting arrangement as defined in
claim 5 wherein the second openings (44) are elongated slots

sized to permit sliding movement of the lock plate (14) between
the first and second positions.
The lamp mounting arrangement as defined in
claim 5 wherein the post elements (40) include resilient head

portions (46) that can be collapsed to permit selective
insertion and removal of the post elements (40) from the second

openings (44).
The lamp mounting arrangement as defined in
claim 5 wherein the post elements (40) include shanks that

extend through the second openings (44) and are retained therein
by resilient head portions (46) that are formed on the shanks,

the second openings (44) being sized to permit free sliding
movement of the shank portions therein.
