<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a novel
ethylene.α-olefin copolymer which is superior to
conventional ethylene copolymers in transparency, heat-sealing
properties, resistance to environmental stress
cracking, and melt tension. The present invention also
relates to a film formed from the novel ethylene.α-olefin
copolymer.Linear low density polyethylenes (LLDPE), which
have a density of not higher than 0.94 g/cm3, are known to
be superior to high density polyethylene in transparency,
impact resistance, and environmental stress cracking
resistance (ESCR), and to be superior to low density
polyethylene in impact resistance and creep resistance.
Therefore, LLDPE is widely used in the field of packing
materials, especially as films and laminating films.The LLDPE, however, is inferior to high-pressure
low-density polyethylene in transparency and melt
elasticity, therefore having disadvantages of less
transparency of the film, less bubble stability in
inflation molding, and larger neck-in. Moreover, when the
ratio of α-olefin comonomer is increased to lower the
density of LLDPE, slip properties of the laminated film
are impaired, blocking of the film is caused, heat-sealing
properties are limited because of broad distribution of 
comonomer composition. The ESCR of LLDPE needs to be
improved further, although LLDPE is better in ESCR than
high-pressure low-density polyethylene. Furthermore,
throughput of LLDPE is low and energy consumption is high
disadvantageously in processing because of its narrower
molecular weight distribution than that of high-pressure
low-density polyethylene.On the other hand, high-pressure low-density
polyethylene exhibits low ESCR, and has low mechanical
strength to cause low tear resistance, and when the film
thickness is increased to raise the strength, the film
becomes coarse and stiff to the touch and adhesiveness
thereof becomes lower.JP-A-60-88016 (1985)
discloses adjustment of composition distribution
and other characteristics to improve transparency, low-temperature
heat-sealability, and anti-blocking
properties. However, it achieves neither uniformity of
the composition nor improvement of the melt elasticity.Thus, it is the object of the present invention
to solve the above problems and to provide a novel
ethylene.α-olefin copolymer which is excellent in
processability, melt elasticity, transparency, heat-sealing
properties, and environmental stress cracking
resistance.A further object is to provide a film formed from
the above ethylene.α-olefin copolymer.These objects have
