<ABSTRACT>
Plasma reactor for a deposition or etching method, comprising a vacuum chamber (1) intended to hold a substrate (5) to be treated and comprising means (3) for introduction of a gas to be ionised, the plasma being excited by an antenna (8) supplied by a radiofrequency power generator (14), the said antenna being composed of an electrical conductor (9) spreading out in a plane parallel to the said substrate to be treated, characterised in that, in the said plane, the antenna conductor (9) runs along a plurality of, at least three, forward (10) and return (11) paths in alternately opposite directions.
