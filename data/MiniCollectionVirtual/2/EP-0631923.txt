<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a closure cap for tightly sealing an opening in a supporting panel, in particular a motor-vehicle body, with a plastic cap part 2 and a plastic sealing part connected thereto. The closure cap 1 comprises two components with a core component 10 made of a hard material and a shell component 20 made of a softer material which surrounds the core component 10 and can be adhesively bonded at the outer edges 3 to the supporting panel.

<CLAIMS>
Closure cover (1, 1', 1'', 1''') for the 
leaktight closure of an opening in a support plate, in 

particular a motor vehicle body, with a plastic cover 
part and a plastic sealing part connected to the latter, 

the closure cover (1, 1', 1'', 1''') comprising two 
components, with a core component (10) composed of a hard 

material and a shell component (20) which is composed of 
a softer material and at least partially surrounds the 

core component (10), characterized in that the shell 
component (20) can be adhesively bonded to the support 

plate at outer rims (3) by the action of heat. 
Closure cover according to Claim 1, characterized 
in that the shell component (20) is composed of a 

flexible material. 
Closure cover according to Claims 1 and 2, with 
a sealing lip which delimits the cover part, 

characterized in that the sealing lip (4, 4') is 
constituted by the shell component (20). 
Closure cover according to Claim 3, with an 
annular flange which adjoins the cover part, passes 

through the opening in the support and has a latching 
ring which engages behind the opening in the support, 

characterized in that the latching ring (6, 6') is made 
up of the core component (10) and the shell component 

(20). 
Closure cover according to Claim 4, characterized 
in that the cover part is of cup-shaped design and merges 

at the outer rims into the flange (5) with the latching 
ring (6) and in that the flange (5) is delimited at the  

 
end by the sealing lip (4) (Fig. 1). 
Closure cover according to Claim 4, characterized 
in that the cover part (2') is adjoined underneath by the 

flange (5') together with the latching ring (6') 
(Fig. 2). 
Closure cover according to one of the preceding 
claims, characterized by production of the core component 

(10) and the shell component (20) by the two-component 
injection method. 
Closure cover according to one of the preceding 
claims, characterized in that the shell component (20) 

completely surrounds the core component (10). 
Closure cover according to one of Claims 1 - 7, 
characterized in that the shell component (20) partially 

surrounds the core component (10). 
Closure cover according to Claim 9, characterized 
in that the shell component (20) surrounds the core 

component (10) in the region of the outer ring (3). 
Closure cover according to one of the preceding 
claims, characterized in that the core component (10) has 

a wall (30) in the form of the lateral surface of a 
cylinder, on the outer surface (31) of which engagement 

elements (32) distributed around the circumference are 
arranged (Fig. 4). 
Closure cover according to Claim 11, 
characterized in that the engagement elements (32) are 

designed as obliquely arranged wings. 
Closure cover according to Claim 11 or 12, 
characterized in that the wings extend at an acute angle 

to radial lines of the wall (30) in the form of the 
lateral surface of a cylinder over a partial area. 
Closure cover according to one of Claims 12 or 
13, characterized in that each wing (32) is triangular, 

one side of the triangle being connected as inner end 
region (33) to the outer surface of the wall (30) in the 

form of the lateral surface of a cylinder, and the 
opposite point of the triangle forming the outer end 

region. 
Closure cover according to one of Claims 12 to  
 

14, characterized in that the wings (32) are arranged 
obliquely in one direction over the entire circumference 

of the wall (30) in the form of the lateral surface of a 
cylinder or two wings in each case are inclined relative 

to one another or wings of one quadrant are in each case 
inclined in a different direction to the wings of 

adjacent quadrants. 
Closure cover according to one of Claims 12 to 
15, characterized in that a sealing lip is arranged on 

the outer circumference of the wall (30) in the form of 
the lateral surface of a cylinder below the outer ring 

(3) and above the wings (32).
