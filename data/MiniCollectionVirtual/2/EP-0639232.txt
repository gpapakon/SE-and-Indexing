<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to iron-based, metallurgical
powder compositions and, more particularly, to powder
compositions which include an improved binder/lubricant.The use of powder metallurgical techniques in the
production of metal parts is well established. Such
techniques typically involve mixing iron-based powders with
an alloying element such as graphite, copper, or nickel in
powder form, compacting the mixture in a die, ejecting the
compact from the die, and sintering of the compact. The
presence of the alloying element permits the attainment of
strength and other mechanical properties in the sintered part
which could not be reached with iron-based powders alone.The alloying ingredients which normally are used in
iron-based powder mixtures typically differ from the basic
iron-based in particle size, shape, and density. For
example, the average particle size of the iron-based powders
used in the manufacture of sintered metal parts is typically
about 25-150 microns. In contrast, the average particle size
of most alloying ingredients used in conjunction with the
iron-based powders is less than about 75 microns and often
less than about 20 microns. Alloying powders are used in
such a finely-divided state to promote rapid homogenization
of the alloy ingredients by solid state diffusion during the
sintering operation. However, this extremely fine size, 
together with the overall differences between the iron-based
and alloying powders in particle size, shape, and density,
make these powder mixtures susceptible to the undesirable
separatory phenomena of segregation and dusting. Binding
agents frequently are added to bond the powder particles and
reduce the segregation. For example, U.S. Patent No.
4,834,800, in the name of Semel, discloses certain water-insoluble
resins as binding agents.Lubricants can also be admixed with a powder blend
to reduce internal friction between particles during
compaction, to permit easier ejection of the compact from the
die cavity, to reduce die wear, and/or to allow more uniform
compaction of the blend. Common lubricants include solids
such as metallic stearates or synthetic waxes. U.S. Patent
No. 4,106,932, in the name of Blanchford, discloses the use
of certain liquid lubricants in microencapsulated form.As will be recognized, most known lubricants reduce
the green strength of the compact. It is believed that
during compaction the lubricant is exuded between iron and/or
alloying particles such that it fills the pore volume between
the particles and interferes with
