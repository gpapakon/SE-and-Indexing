<ABSTRACT>
A process and apparatus for producing a gaseous oxygen product at a delivery 
pressure containing a low concentration of heavy impurities in which 

compressed and purified air is cooled in a main heat exchanger 26 to near its 
dew point temperatures and then introduced into a double rectification column 

28 comprising a high pressure column 30 and a low pressure column 32 in a 
heat transfer relationship with one another through a condenser-reboiler 40. A 

liquid oxygen fraction 45 separated in the low pressure column 32 and collects 
in the sump 42 of the column 32. Partial reboiling of the liquid in the sump 42 

results in its concentration of heavy impurities being enhanced relative to the 
liquid phase flowing into the sump through a downcomer 44. A main product 

stream is withdrawn from the liquid phase before it reaches the sump and is 
pumped to a delivery pressure and then vaporized within the main heat 

exchanger 26. A purge stream of liquid oxygen from the sump is removed so 
that the impurity concentration level within the main liquid oxygen product 

stream does not reach its solubility limit.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a process and apparatus for producing a
gaseous oxygen product at a delivery pressure by rectifying air.In cryogenic air separation plants that produce gaseous oxygen at a delivery
pressure by vaporizing pumped liquid oxygen within a main heat exchanger,
heavy impurities such as carbon dioxide and hydrocarbons can exceed their
solubility limits in the liquid oxygen as it vaporizes. As a result, carbon dioxide
contained within the liquid oxygen can solidify to plug heat exchange
passageways within the main heat exchanger and hydrocarbons such as
acetylene can come out of solution to present a safety hazard. This occurs
because the heavy impurities such as carbon dioxide and hydrocarbons have a
much lower vapour pressure than oxygen and as such, tend to concentrate in
liquid oxygen being produced within the air separation plant. When the liquid
oxygen is raised to a higher pressure by pumping and then vaporized by being
heated within the main heat exchanger of the air separation plant, the resulting
increase in vaporization temperature increases the vapour pressures of the heavy
impurities to a degree greater than the oxygen vapour pressure increase and
hence, the heavy impurities vaporize before the liquid oxygen is fully vaporized.
The heavy impurities may then freeze on heat exchange surfaces within the
main heat exchanger thus deleteriously affecting the performance of the heat
exchanger.EP-A-0 024 962 relates to an air separation process of the internal kind in which
the main oxygen product stream is taken from the sump of the low pressure
column.Both JP-A-3099190 and DE-A-3 016 317 disclose double column air separation
processes not of the internal compression kind in which oxygen product is taken 
from above the bottom stage of the low pressure column so as to diminish its
content of hydrocarbon impurity. JP-A-3099190 shows that a liquid oxygen
stream 16 is withdrawn from the sump of the low pressure column and the
preamble to claims 1, 2 and 7 below is based thereupon.As will be discussed, the present invention provides a process and apparatus for
the separation of air to produce a gaseous oxygen product at a delivery pressure
with a low level of heavy impurity concentration and without delivering the
product at a higher than necessary delivery pressure.The present invention provides a process for producing a gaseous oxygen
product at a delivery pressure and so as to contain a low concentration of heavy
impurities. As used herein, heavy impurities include carbon

A process for producing a gaseous oxygen product at a delivery pressure

the steps of cooling a stream of compressed air (70) in a main heat
exchanger (26) to a temperature suitable for its separation by rectification,

fractionating the air (or a fluid mixture separated therefrom) in a
rectification column (28) and thereby obtaining liquid oxygen, reboiling a

part of said liquid oxygen so as to create a volume of residual liquid
oxygen relatively rich in the heavy impurities, withdrawing a purge stream

(84) of said residual liquid oxygen, withdrawing a major stream (80) of
oxygen, relatively lean in heavy impurities, from the said rectification

column (28), characterised by taking the major stream in liquid state from
upstream of the reboiling, pumping the purge stream (84) to a sufficiently

high pressure level that on vaporisation the heavy impurities vaporise
substantially with the liquid oxygen contained within the purge stream
