<ABSTRACT>
Device for forming a special steel diaphragm for vacuum insulation elements in a press which has a bottom plate (1) that accepts a pressing pressure and a cover plate (12) which can be moved towards the said bottom plate and exerts pressing pressure, a rubber pad (5) which diverts the pressing forces in directions transverse to the direction of motion of the cover plate (12) being provided adjacent to a blank (3) to be formed. Method for forming special steel diaphragms in a press provided with a bottom plate (1) and a cover plate (12) which can be moved towards the said bottom plate and exerts pressing forces, the pressing forces exerted by the press ram (2) being diverted in directions transverse to the directions of motion of the press ram (2) by means of a rubber pad (5).

A press tool for forming stainless steel membranes for vacuum thermal insulation
elements in a press which comprises a baseplate (1) which absorbs a pressing pressure

and a top plate (12) which can travel in a direction towards the baseplate and which
exerts a pressing pressure, wherein a rubber plunger (5), which deflects the pressing

forces in directions transverse to the direction of movement of the top plate (12), is
provided adjacent to a blank (3) to be formed, characterised in that the blank (3) is

disposed between the rubber plunger (5) and a forming die (4) which forms a negative
mould, and that the forming die (4) has a bellows-like surface (6) which corresponds

to a stainless steel membrane to be produced and on to which the blank (3) is pressed after
or during the forming thereof, wherein the rubber plunger (5) has a central pressing face

(7) which faces the blank (3) and to which two flank faces (8, 9) are adjacent, which are
each bevelled in the opposite direction to the direction of pressing and which each have

dimensions larger than the central pressing face (7), and a cavity (23) is formed between
the rubber plunger (5) and the surface (6) of the forming die (4), which cavity is completely

filled by the rubber material of the rubber plunger (5) and by the finished stainless steel
membrane (24) on the completion of a pressing operation.
A press tool according to claim 1, characterised in that the forming die (4) is clamped, in
the directions of movement of the top plate (12), between a lower die support plate (12) and

an upper die cover plate (11).
A press tool according to claim 2, characterised in that rubber springs (13, 14) extend
between the baseplate (1) and the die support plate (10) and between the die cover plate (11)

and the top plate (12) which is acted upon by the press ram (2), via which rubber springs
the die support plate (10) and the die cover plate (11) are held in their positions during a

pressing operation.
A press tool according to claims 1 to 3, characterised in that the baseplate (1) and the top
plate (12) are provided with mutually facing rams (15, 16), between which and a bearing 

face (17, 18) of the rubber plunger (5) in each case there are platens (19, 20) which
transmit pressing forces.
A press tool according to claim 4, characterised in that the platens (19, 20) consist of a
constant-volume elastic synthetic material, preferably an urelast synthetic material.
A press tool according to claims 3 to 5, characterised in that the platens (19, 20) are
supported in horizontal directions on the die support plate (10), on the die cover plate (11)

and on a support block (21) facing these.
A press tool according to claim 6, characterised in that on its back face (22) remote from
the blank (3) the rubber plunger (5) is supported on the support block (21).
The use of the press tool according to claims 1 to 7 for forming stainless steel membranes,
characterised in that the pressing forces exerted by the press ram (2) are deflected, via a

rubber plunger (5), in directions transverse to the directions of movement of the press ram
(2), wherein the deflected pressing forces are first introduced by the central pressing face

(7) of the rubber plunger (5) into the blank (3) and the latter is pressed into the bellows-like
indentations in the surface (6) of the forming die (4), and the edge strips (25) of the blank

(3) which are not acted upon by the central pressing face (7) of the rubber plunger (22) are
first deformed towards the flank faces (8, 9) of the rubber plunger (22) and then, on the

further application of pressure, are laid by said flank faces round outer faces (26, 27) of the
forming die (4).
