<ABSTRACT>
A tape cassette (1) includes: a case (2) having an upper half (3) and a lower 
half (4), and having a recess (5) in a front side; two tape reels (19, 19') rotatably 

supported within the case (2); a recording tape (20) having opposite ends fastened to 
the two tape reels (19, 19'), respectively, and wound on the two tape reels so that a 

portion thereof extends along the front side of the recess (5); and a lid assembly (21) 
covering the portion of the tape (20) extending along the front side of the recess (5) 

while the cassette (1) is not in use. The lower half (4) is formed with locating contact 
protrusions which contact locating lugs formed in a recording/reproducing apparatus 

for locating a miniature tape cassette commonly used with the recording/reproducing 
apparatus. The locating contact protrusions engage with gaps formed on the lower 

edge of a front surface portion of the lid assembly (21) when the cassette is not in use 
and the lid assembly is in a closed position.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to tape cassettes. There is known a recording/reproducing apparatus capable of using both a large 
tape cassette and a miniature tape cassette, that is, the so-called compatible 
recording/reproducing apparatus. Such recording/reproducing apparatus are designed so as to use as many 
members and devices common to a large tape cassette and a miniature tape cassette 
as possible to simplify the construction thereof. For example, recesses, i.e., mouths into which a tape driving member is 
inserted when the tape cassette is loaded into a recording/reproducing apparatus, of 
substantially the same size are formed respectively in  
 
the large tape cassette and the miniature tape cassette 
to use the same tape driving member in the same 
operating mode for driving the recording tapes of both 
the large tape cassette and the miniature tape cassette. Fig. 15 shows, in a superposed view, a large 
tape cassette a and a miniature tape cassette b 
respectively having mouths c and d of substantially the 
same size to be used on such a recording/reproducing 
apparatus. Some compatible recording/reproducing 
apparatuses are provided with common locating lugs to be 
used for both locating the large tape cassette a and 
locating the miniature tape cassette b. When the miniature tape cassette is to be used 
on such a recording/reproducing apparatus, the miniature 
tape cassette must be provided with locating contact 
protrusions in ranges e. Naturally, the large tape cassette a also must 
be provided with locating contact protrusions in the 
ranges e to use the common locating lugs. However, as regards the large tape cassette a, 
it is preferable, in view of stable locating, that 
locating contact protrusions of the large tape cassette 
a to be brought into contact with locating lugs are  
 
separated from each other by a comparatively large 
distance and hence it is preferable to separate the 
locating contact protrusions of the large tape cassette 
a by a largest possible distance from each other when 
the large tape cassette a is used on a 
recording/reproducing apparatus designed for using only 
the large tape cassette a. Accordingly, the locating 
contact protrusions of the large tape cassette <a> are 
formed in ranges f. The tape cassette is provided with a lid to 
protect an exposed portion of the recording tape 
contained therein. If the locating contact protrusions are 
covered with the lid assembly, the tape cassette cannot 
be located with the lid assembly positioned at its 
closed
