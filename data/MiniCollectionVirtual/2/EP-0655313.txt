<ABSTRACT>
The process serves for moulding a container (45) from a thermoplastic material. Following a controlled-temperature phase, a preform (3) is fed to a blowing station (1), which has a blow mould (2) which is provided for contouring the container (45). The preform (3) of controlled temperature is introduced into the blow mould (2). By feeding in high-pressure blowing air, the preform (3) is expanded. In addition, at least one further pneumatic working step is carried out with low-pressure air, which is taken from a low-pressure air supply (15). The low-pressure air supply (15) has a lower pressure level than the high-pressure blowing-air supply (16). Following an expansion of the preform (3), high-pressure blowing air flowing out from the moulded container (45) secured in the blow mould (2) is fed during a transitional phase to the low-pressure air supply (15). In the region of the low-pressure air supply (15), pressure monitoring is carried out to limit a low air pressure provided as a maximum. Following the transitional phase, a venting of the container (45) held in the blow mould (2) is carried out with respect to an ambient pressure.
