<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to controlled-release soil granulates which can be obtained by depositing a coating containing active ingredients onto a solid carrier on a fluidized bed, a method for producing said soil granulates and a method for combating phytopathogenic fungi, undesirable vegetation growth or undesirable insect infestation and/or for regulating vegetation growth by means of the controlled-release soil granulates provided for in the invention.

<CLAIMS>
Soil-applied CR granules obtainable by applying an
active-ingredient-comprising coating to a solid carrier in a

fluidized bed with a defined heat input adjustable to 6000 to
25,000 kJ/kg of coating polymer, the coating comprising at

least one coating polymer from amongst butyl acrylate/styrene
copolymers, copolymer dispersions of acrylic and methacrylic

esters, polyethylene wax emulsions, polyesters composed of
the following units: 50 mol% dimethyl terephthalate + approx.

50 mol% adipic acid + 150 mol% 1,4-butanediol and
ethylene/methacrylic acid zinc salt.

   0-60% by weight of one or more additives,

the total of the % by weight of the compounds in the coating
being 100% by weight.
Soil-applied CR granules as claimed in claim 1 or 2,
obtainable by applying an aqueous polyethylene wax dispersion

which comprises - based on the aqueous wax dispersion - 5-40%

dicarboxylic acid with 3-8 C atoms and 90-75% by weight of

ethylene with an MFI value, measured at 190°C and a load of
2.16 kp, of 1-600 or an MFI value, measured at 160°C and

325 p, of 1-600, 0.1 to 5% by weight of alkali metal
