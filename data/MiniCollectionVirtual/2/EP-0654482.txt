<ABSTRACT>
New composition consisting of a mixture containing one or a number of cationic polygalactomannans and anionic xanthan gum. The mixture enables higher viscosities to be obtained when it is dispersed in a solvent. The mixture may be used in alimentary products, explosives, chemical products for oilfields, textile fibres and chemical products for agriculture and cosmetics.

or more cationic polymers and of approximately 99-1
parts by weight of substituted anionic xanthan gum, the

total of the cationic polymer or polymers and of the
substituted anionic xanthan gum being 100 parts by

weight.
Composition according to claim 1, characterized
in that the cationic polymer is one or more

polygalactomannans having a degree of substitution of
between 0.01 and 3.
Composition according to claim 2, characterized
in that the polygalactomannan or polygalactomannans are

cationic derivatives of guar gum or of locust bean gum.
Composition according to the preceding claim,
characterized in that the polygalactomannan or

polygalactomannans are cationic derivatives of guar
gum.
Composition according to any one of the
preceding claims, characterized in that the

polygalactomannan or polygalactomannans are substituted
by one or more cationic groups chosen from the

following groups: quaternary ammonium, acids salts of
primary, secondary or tertiary amines, sulphonium,

phosphonium and their mixtures.
Composition according to any one of the
precedin
g claims, characterized in that the substituted
anionic xanthan gum results from the substitution on

its molecular skeleton of one or more anionic groups 
chosen from sulphonates, sulphates, carboxylates and

phosphates.
Composition according to claim 6, characterized
in that the xanthan gum is substituted on its skeleton

by derivatives of ethylenically unsaturated monomers
which comprise one or more sulphonate groups.
Composition according to any one of claims 1 to
7, characterized in that it comprises a mixture of a

polygalactomannan having a degree of substitution of
between 0.01 and 1.00 and of an anionic xanthan gum,

the gum being substituted on its skeleton by
derivatives of ethylenically unsaturated monomers which

comprise sulphonate groups.
Composition according to either of claims 7 and
8, characterized in that the ethylenically unsaturated

monomers are chosen from the group comprising
2-acrylamido-2-methylpropanesulphonic acid and

1-allyloxy-2-hydroxypropanesulphonic acid and their
salts.
Composition according to one of the preceding
claims, characterized in that the amount and the degree

of substitution of the cationic polymer or polymers and
of the substituted anionic xanthan gum are proportioned

so that a composition comprising a neutrally charged
mixture is obtained.
Composition according to one of claims 1 to 8,
characterized in that the cationic polygalactomannan or

polygalactomannans and the substituted anionic xanthan
gum can be

mixed in the dry state in the desired
ratio and subsequently added to water;
Composition according to any one of claims 1 to 10,
characterized in that the cationic polygalactomannan or

polygalactomannans and the substituted anionic xanthan gum are each
suspended separately in a solvent or fluid, for the purpose of forming

solutions which are subsequently mixed.
Composition according to claim 12, characterized in that the
cationic polygalactomannan or polygalactomanns and the substituted

anionic xanthan gum are dispersed in a solvent or fluid, and then added to 
one another in relative amounts in order to obtain a neutrally charged

solution.
Composition according to one of claims 12 or 13, characterized
in that the solvent or fluid, is water.
Use of a composition according to any one of
the preceding claims for the manufacture of a viscous

liquid or of a gel, characterized in that, in order to
obtain 100 parts by weight of viscous liquid or of gel,

0.1 to 2.0 parts by weight of a composition as defined
above is/are added to the solvent.
Use of a composition according to the preceding
claim for the manufacture of a viscous liquid or of a

gel, characterized in that the solvent is water.
Use of a composition according to any one of
claims 1 to 14 or of a viscous liquid or of a gel

manufactured according to either of claims 15 and 16 as
thickeners in foodstuffs, explosives, chemicals for oil

fields, agricultural applications, cosmetic products,
textile fibres, body care products and the manufacture

of paper.
