<ABSTRACT>
Surface acoustic wave filter having a number of tracks (1 to 4) with an input transducer (70), an output transducer (71), a first reflector pattern (81) and a second reflector pattern (70) [sic] on each track, the reflector structures forming a resonator. The resonators of the individual tracks (1 to 4) are tuned to closely adjacent frequencies (f1 to f4) which are different from one another, and the input transducers, on the one hand, and the output transducers, on the other hand, are connected in parallel as input and output of the filter. The positioning and choice of phase for input transducers and output transducers is preferably selected in such a manner that direct transducer/transducer transfer for pairs of tracks at the output is eliminated by interference.
