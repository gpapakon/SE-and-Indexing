<ABSTRACT>
The sides are at right angles to the spine. The binder (1) or at least part of it, is made of shape memory material. At room temperature, the two side parts are pre-tensioned towards each other and clamping force exerted on the sheets (3) of the document stack (2) inserted between the side parts. Opening the binder element for inserting or removing sheets takes place by heating up the binder element to a temperature adjusted to the shape memory material and above room temperature.

A binding element for binding a stack of documents
consisting of loose sheets, with a spine part and

two side parts, wherein the side parts are disposed

substantially perpendicularly to the spine part,
characterised in that
 the binding element (1) is
made from a "shape memory" material
or in that
 at least a part of the binding element
(1) is made from a shape memory material.
A binding element according to Claim 1,
characterised in that
 at room temperature the two
side parts (5, 6) are pretensioned in relation to

one another, by which a clamping force is exerted on
the sheets (3) of the stack of documents (2)

inserted between the side parts (5, 6)
and in that
 the opening of the binding element (1)
for the purpose of the insertion or removal of

sheets (3) of the stack of documents (2) takes place
by heating the binding element (1) up to a

temperature lying above room temperature and set at
the shape memory material.
A binding element according to Claim 1 or 2,
characterised in that
 in the event that parts of the
binding element (1) are made from shape memory

material, said parts are inserted into the spine
part (15) and/or the side parts (16, 18) of a

binding spine (11) or are attached thereto. 
A binding element according to Claim 3,
characterised in that
 the binding spine (11) is
produced from a material whose expansive force (S1)

is less than the expansive force (S2) of the part
which is produced from the shape memory material.
A binding element according to Claim 3 or 4,
characterised in that
 the part or parts which are
produced from shape memory material have the form of

a spring (8), a strip (9) or a wire (10).
A binding element according to Claim 1 or 5,
characterised in that
 the spring (8) is fastened
between the two side parts (16, 17) above the spine

part (15) of the binding spine (11).
A binding element according to Claim 1 or 5,
characterised in that
 the spine part (15) is
provided in the central regions of the side parts

(16, 17) of the binding spine (11)
and in that
 the spring (8) is fastened between the
two side parts (16, 17) beneath the spine part (15).
A binding element according to Claim 1, 2 or 3,
characterised in that
 a part (15, 16, 17) or one of
the parts (15, 16, 17), which is made from shape

memory material, substantially has the shape of the
binding spine (11).
A binding element according to Claim 1, 2 or 3,
characterised in that
 a part (15, 16, 17) or one of
the parts (15, 16, 17), which is produced from shape 

memory material, consists of a spine part (4) and
two side parts (5, 6)
and in that
 the part (15, 16, 17) or the parts (15,
16, 17) is or are attached to a spine part (13) made

from any material (cardboard, plastic, metal, e.g.
spring steel).
A binding element according to Claim 8 or 9,
characterised in that
 a part (15, 16, 17) or one of
the parts (15, 16, 17) which are made from shape

memory material is or are an integral component of
the spine part (15) and/or of the side parts (16,

17) of the binding spine (11)
or in that
 the part (15, 16, 17) is attached by
means of suitable attachment means (12) to the spine

part (15) and/or the side parts (16, 17) of the
binding spine (11).
