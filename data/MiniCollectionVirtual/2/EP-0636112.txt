<ABSTRACT>
A silicon nitride sintered body has a composition consisting essentially of 85 to 94 % by weight  beta  silicon nitride, 6 to 15 % by weight grain boundary phase consisting essentially of (i) at least two rare earth elements, wherein yttrium is considered a rare earth, and, optionally, strontium which, calculated as SrO, is 0 to 2 percent by weight of the total body, and (ii) at least two of Si, N, O and C, and an additive consisting essentially of a metal carbon compound present in the amount of about 0.2 to 3.5 % by volume. The additive is substantially homogeneously dispersed within the sintered body. The sintered body has a microstructure wherein (i) the  beta silicon nitride grains are acicular and have an average grain width ranging from 0.5 to 1.5  mu m, (ii) at least 25 % of the grains have width greater than 0.7  mu m, and at least 10 % of the grains have width greater than 1  mu m, and (iii) no more than 5 % of grains have width greater than 3.5  mu m and apparent aspect ratio greater than 5, with the proviso that the average aspect ratio is at least 1.8 and a fracture origin, at least 90 % of which is comprised of large acicular  beta Si3N4 grains, the average size of which ranges from about 15 to 50  mu m. Such a ceramic has high strength, high toughness and long term durability, and is especially suited for industrial applications such as components for gas turbine and automotive engines.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a process for making a sintered silicon 
nitride ceramic having high fracture toughness, 
strength, and reliability. Silicon nitride ceramics are well known for their 
excellent strength at temperature in excess of 1000°C. 
However, at temperature greater than 1200°C for the 
advanced turbine engine applications, few silicon 
nitride ceramics meet the strength and reliability 
requirements. Furthermore, conventional silicon 
nitride ceramics have fracture toughness typically 
ranging from 4 to 6 MPa·m0.5, such low toughness makes 
them susceptible to significant strength degradation 
from the damage introduced during engine operation. It 
would be desirable to provide a silicon nitride having 
high fracture toughness, hence strong resistance to 
damage, high strength, and high reliability both at 
room and elevated temperature. Moreover, it would be 
most desirable to have a silicon nitride material with 
this combination of excellent properties which can 
easily be formed into near net shape parts of complex 
geometry.  
 Sintering silicon nitride requires sintering aids 
which form grain boundary phases. Rare earth oxides 
are effective sintering aids and form refractory grain 
boundary phases yielding silicon nitride ceramics with 
good high temperature properties. However, they often 
require high sintering temperature and/or the 
application of external pressure for complete 
densification. Hot pressing generally produces silicon nitride 
ceramics with excellent strength properties. U.S. 
Pat. No. 4,234,343 to Anderson discloses that hot 
pressed silicon nitride containing different rare earth 
oxides as sintering aids can have 250 MPa to 550 MPa 
strength at 1400°C with smaller rare earth element 
resulting in higher 1400°C strength. Ueno and Toibana 
report in Yogyo-Kyokai-Shi, vol. 9, 409-414 (1983) that 
hot pressed silicon nitride containing yttria (Y2O3) in 
combination with other rare earth oxides exhibits 
strength of over 600 MPa at 1300°C. U.S. Pat. No. 
5,021,372 discloses silicon nitridebased ceramic formed 
by hot pressing having room temperature 4-point bend 
strength ranging from about 600 to 1200 MPa and 
fracture toughness greater than 6 MPa·m0.5, but the 
additives used in the fabrication restrict the 
applications of this silicon nitride to relatively low 
temperature. Furthermore, it is well known in the 
field that the process of hot pressing has limited 
value in the production of structural ceramics because 
of its shape and size limitations. It is
