<DESCRIPTION>
ELECTRICAL CONNECTOR FOR A LIQUID LEVEL INDICATOR.TECHNICAL AREA The present invention relates to an electrical connection for feeding current to a fluid level transmitter, compri¬ sing a rod-shaped carrier for two parallel resistance wi¬ res wound spirally around the rod and a float, displace¬ able along the rod by the fluid level variations, having a contact device for creating a current circuit through the wires, whereby the resistance will vary depending on the position of the float along the carrier.STATE OF THE ART Through US 5 020 366, a fluid level transmitter according to the above description is known, which is primarily used in vehicle fuel tanks.The rod wires, usually consisting of a nickel alloy are, according to the known technique, connected through sol¬ dering of the loose ends to contact devices subsequently connected to the vehicle wire harness for current supply and for measurement of the float level related re¬ sistance. The soldering is manual, and cumbersome and ti- me-consuming as the wire is not wet by tin solder. Bad connections, so called dry joints, are the primary cause of malfunction on these instrument transmitters.THE TECHNICAL PROBLEM One purpose of the present invention is therefore to ob- 

tain a reliable connection which does not create such high demands on the manual assembly work.THE SOLUTION This is achieved, according to the invention, by a socket made of an electrically insulating material for holding one rod end, which socket comprises two oblong connector plates made of an electrically conductive material, loca¬ ted one on each side of the rod, right across the long- itudinal direction of the rod, each of them being separa¬ tely fixed by at least two holding points so as to press against one each of the two resistance wires.Advantageous embodiments of the invention are shown in the below patent claims.FIGURE DESCRIPTIONOne embodiment of the invention will now be described with reference to the enclosed drawing, in whichFig. 1 shows a fluid level transmitter according to the invention, seen from below, Fig .2 is a section along the line II-II in Fig.l, and Fig. 3 is a section along the line III-III in Fig.l.PREFERRED EMBODIMENTSThe fluid level transmitter for which the invention is intended to be used has been described in US 5 020 366 and therefore needs no detailed presentation here.In short, the fluid level transmitter comprises a rod 10 and, not shown in the figures, a float encircling the rod, which is vertically mobile along the rod in depen¬ dence of

PATENT CLAIMS 1. Electrical connection for feeding current to a fluid level transmitter comprising a rod-shaped carrier (10) for two parallel resistance wires (11, 12) wound spirally around the rod, and a float, displaceable along the rod (10) by the fluid level variation, having a contact devi- ce for creating a current circuit through the wires (11, 12) , whereby the resistance will vary depending on the position of the float along the carrier, c h a r a c t e r i z e d b y a socket (13) of electri¬ cally insulating material for holding one rod (10) end, which socket comprises two oblong connector plates (14, 15) made from an electrically conductive material, loca¬ ted one on each side of the rod, right across the long¬ itudinal direction of the rod, each of them being fixed at least at two holding points (16, 17) so as to press against one each of the two resistance wires (11, 12) .
2. Electrical connection according to claim 1, c h a r a c t e r i z e d b y the resistance wires (11, 12 ) running with a comparatively higher pitch and a lar¬ ger reciprocal distance past the connector plates (14, 15) than along the other parts of the rod (10) .
3. Electrical connection according to claim 2, c h a r a c t e r i z e d b y the wires (11, 12) run- ning at an angle of about 30 to about 50 degrees past the connector plates (14, 15) .
4. Electrical connection according to any of the pre¬ vious claims, c h a r a c t e r i z e d b y each con- nector plate (14, 15) resting on two angular shoulders 


(20) in the socket (13), the former being arranged in pairs on each side of the rod (10) .
5. Electrical connection according to any of the pre¬ vious claims, c h a r a c t e r i z e d b y a part of each connector plate (14, 15) being shaped as a flat pin connector (21), intended to fit into a female connector belonging to a wire harness.
