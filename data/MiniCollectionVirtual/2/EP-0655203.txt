<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a new feed for cultured fish 
containing 0.5 to 200 ppm neohesperidin dihydrochalcone 

which improves acceptability to the fish and leads to 
higher feed intake.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a new feed for cultured
fish characterized in that the feed provided to fish
contains neohesperidin dihydrochalcone.The incorporation of neohesperidin dihydrochalcone into
feed improves acceptability to the fish and this leads to
a higher intake.Reduction of fish availability due to extensive fishing
has lead to the development of the aquaculture industry,
which is devoted to produce fish and other aquatic
species in controlled bodies of water.One of the main problems associated with the development
of aquaculture is to provide an adequate feed which meets
all the nutritional needs of each particular cultured
fish. However, the successful use of a commercial fish
feed is also largely related to its palatability
characteristics, which depend upon its chemical
composition.As is typical of vertebrates, fish use their oral taste
buds to determine the palatability of feed and,
consequently, the choice for food. Accordingly, the
gustatory system of fish is sensitive to a variety of
chemical compounds. In effect, several species of fish 
have been shown to be responsive to various aminoacids,
betain, quaternary ammonium compounds, nucleotides,
organic acids and alcohols, amines and amides, urea,
taurine, dimethylthetin, indole, skatol, histamine, D-ribose,
D-glucose, D-fructose, sucrose and ractopamine
(Jones KA: "Journal of Fish Biology" (1989) 34, 149-160;
Jones KA: "Journal of Fish Biology" (1990) 37, 413-423;
Anderson DB & Veenhuizen EL: USA Patent No. 5,216,029, 1-6-93).Neohesperidin dihydrochalcone is an intense sweetener
which is prepared by procedures described in the prior
art (Horowitz RM & Gentili B. In: "Alternative
Sweeteners", 2nd edition, L.O.Nabors & R.C. Gelardi, Ed.,
pp.97-116, 1991, Marcel Dekker Inc., N.Y.) and has the
following structural formula:
At low concentrations it is several hundreds of times
sweeter than sucrose (Dubois GE et al: "Journal of
Medicinal Chemistry" (1981) 24, 408-428; Crosby GA et al:
"New Sweeteners". In: CRC Handbook of Food Additives,
T.E.Furia, Ed., Boca Rat√≥n, CA, CRC Press 1980, Vol.1,
203-216). It has a pleasant sweet taste and lacks any
bitter or metallic aftertaste (Schiffman SS et al:
"Physiology and Behaviour" (1970) 23, 1-9).The relative intense sweetness of neohesperidin
dihydrochalcone like that of other sweeteners decreases
with increasing concentrations. Thus, neohesperidin
dihydrochalcone is about 1800 times sweeter than sucrose
at concentrations that are near the threshold of
organoleptic perception (Horowitz RM &
