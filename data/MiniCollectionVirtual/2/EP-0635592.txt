<ABSTRACT>
The weft feeder comprises a fixed body (11), a 
rotatable disk (12) which winds a reserve of turns (S) on a 

fixed drum (13), and a fixed magnet supporting plate (14) 
which supports the drum and is rigidly coupled to the fixed 

body (11) by means of permanent magnets (15-16). The magnet 
supporting plate (14) has an annular perimetric blind 

groove (17) which receives the base (13a) of the drum (13) 
in order to center and retain it, and acts as a barrier 

against the accidental passage of the turns of thread into 
the fixed body (11) of the feeder.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a weft feeder for 
weaving looms and other textile machines, and more 
precisely to a weft feeder of the type comprising a fixed 
drum on which a movable hollow arm, associated with a 
rotatable disk driven by an equally hollow drive shaft, 
winds multiple turns of thread which form a reserve of weft 
for said loom or the like. A weft feeder of this kind in described e.g. in FR-A-2 127 934 and WO 92/01101. In weft feeders , the rotatable disk is 
arranged at the base of the fixed drum and is interposed 
between the fixed body of the feeder and a drum supporting 
plate which is mounted so that it can rotate freely on the 
drive shaft of the disk and is held in position by the 
action of permanent magnets which cooperate with magnets of 
opposite polarity which are supported by the fixed body; in 
the present description, said drum supporting plate is 
referenced as magnet supporting plate. In conventional weft feeders, the edge of the base of 
the drum externally surrounds the magnet supporting plate 
so that, as will become apparent hereinafter, an annular 
gap for connection to the inside of the fixed body of the 
feeder is delimited between the base of the drum and the 
rotatable disk. If the weft feeder is installed in areas where 
aspirating and/or blowing machines operate, or more 
generally is located in the presence of air jets typically 
used for cleaning, the turns wound on the drum can 
partially unwind from said drum, slip to its base and  
 
accidentally enter the fixed body of the feeder, passing 
through said annular gap. This is a severe drawback, since the thread can form 
tangles and jam the rotatable disk and/or the mechanisms 
arranged on the fixed body. A principal aim of the present invention is 
essentially to eliminate this and other drawbacks, and 
within the scope of this general aim said invention has the 
important and particular object of providing a weft feeder 
with a magnet supporting plate and a drum associated with 
said plate which are shaped and mutually arranged so as to 
prevent the thread, when affected by an air jet, from 
entering the fixed body of the weft feeder. With this aim, these and other objects in view, the 
invention provides a weft feeder provided with a magnet 
supporting disk and with a drum having the characteristics 
specified in the appended claims. Substantially, according to the invention, the magnet 
supporting plate is provided with an annular perimetric 
blind groove which accommodates the base of the drum to

<CLAIMS>
Weft feeder (10) of the type comprising a fixed 
body (11), a rotatable disk (12) which winds a reserve of 

turns (S) on a fixed drum (13), and a fixed magnet 
supporting plate (14) which supports the drum and is 

rigidly coupled to the fixed body (11) by means of 
permanent magnets (15-16), characterized in that the magnet 

supporting plate (14) has an annular perimetric blind 
groove (17) which receives the base (13a) of the drum (13) 

in order to center and retain it, said groove further 
acting as a barrier against the accidental passage of the 

turns of thread into the fixed body (11) of the feeder. 
Weft feeder according to claim 1, characterized in 
that the transverse and axial dimensions of said groove 

(17) are larger than the corresponding dimensions 
(thickness and axial depth) of the edge (13a) of the drum 

(13), so as to delimit a blind channel (18) for 
accommodating and retaining the turns of thread which slide 

at the base of said drum. 
Weft feeder according to claims 1 and 2, 
characterized in that said groove (17) has, at its outer 

edge, a flared portion (17a) for guiding the entry of the 
thread in said blind channel (18).
