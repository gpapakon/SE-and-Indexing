<ABSTRACT>
In a recording and/or reproducing apparatus (1, 1') with an apparatus housing (2, 2') and a chassis (43, 43') which is housed in the latter and on which at least one adjustable apparatus part (37, 37', 60, 60', 61, 61', 67, 67', 69, 69', 75, 75', 108, 108', 111, 111', 112, 112', 113, 113') is adjustably held, for controlling the adjusting of at least one adjustably held apparatus part there is provided an adjustable control device (70, 70', 86, 86') which can be swivelled about an axis (47, 47', 48, 48') and is coupled via a coupling device (79, 79', 102, 102') to an adjustable actuating device (80, 80', 103, 103'), which can be coupled in a predetermined relative position with respect to the chassis (43, 43') to the control device (70, 70', 86, 86') and is connected to a handle (17, 17', 18, 18') which can be operated manually. For the simple forming of two versions of the apparatus which differ with regard to the arrangement of the chassis (43, 43') in the apparatus housing (2, 2'), the control device (70, 70', 86, 86') has two coupling elements (81, 81', 104, 104') which are arranged offset with respect to each other by a certain angle and with each of these coupling elements of the control device (70, 70', 86, 86') there can be brought into operative connection a coupling element (83, 83', 105, 105') of one of two actuating devices (80, 80', 103, 103'), of which one actuating device (80, 103) can be coupled to the control device (70, 86) in one predetermined relative position with respect to the chassis (43) and the other actuating device (80', 103') can be coupled to the control device (70', 86') in a second relative position with respect to the chassis (43').

A recording and/or reproducing apparatus (1; 1') comprising an apparatus
housing (2; 2'), a chassis (43; 43') arranged inside the apparatus housing (2; 2'),

apparatus parts arranged on the chassis (43; 43') and including at least one apparatus
part arranged on the chassis so as to be movable, and at least one control device (70,

86; 70', 86') provided to control the movement of least one apparatus part arranged on
the chassis (43; 43') so as to be movable, which at least one control device is mounted

so as to be pivotable about a spindle (47, 48; 47', 48'), is movable between at least two
operating positions relative to the chassis (43; 43') and the apparatus parts 
arranged
thereon, and is coupled to a movable actuating device (80, 103; 80', 103') 
via
 a
coupling device (79, 102; 79', 102'), which actuating device can be coupled to the

control device (70, 86; 70', 86') 
via
 the coupling device (79, 102; 79', 102') in a given
position relative to the chassis (43; 43') and the apparatus parts arranged thereon, and

which is connected to a hand-actuated actuating member (17, 18; 17', 18') of the
apparatus (1; 1'), which member is disposed at least partly outside the apparatus

housing (2; 2'), the coupling device (79, 102; 79', 102') comprising a coupling element
on the control device (70, 86; 70', 86') and on the actuating device (80, 103; 80',

103'), characterized in that the control device (70, 86; 70', 86') comprises two coupling
elements (81, 81', 104, 104'; 81', 81, 104', 104) which are spaced apart by a given

angle relative to the spindle (47, 48; 47', 48'), and one of two actuating devices (80,
103; 80', 103') is engageable with each coupling element (81, 81', 104, 104'; 81', 81,

104', 104) of the control device (70, 86; 70', 86'), of which one actuating device (80,
103) can be coupled to the control device in a given position relative to the chassis (43)

and the apparatus parts arranged on the chassis (43), and the other actuating device
(80', 103') can be coupled to the control device in a position rotated through the given

angle with respect to the given position relative to the chassis (43') and the apparatus
parts arranged on the chassis (43').
An apparatus as claimed in Claim 1, characterized in that the two
coupling elements (81, 81', 104, 104'; 81', 81, 104', 104) of the control device (70,
