<ABSTRACT>
An injection device is adapted to eject a sequence of doses from the needle (8) of a capsule (5) carried within its barrel-like body (1). A plunger (11) extending rearwardly from the capsule (5) has ratchet teeth (12) along its length engaged by pawls (21) at the forward end of a drive tube (23) biased forwardly by a spring (29) and manipulable by a knob (24) at the rear end of the body (1). The capsule (5) is in a sleeve-like carrier (4) having limited longitudinal travel, a lost motion connection (18, 19) to the drive tube (23) and an engagement with the ratchet teeth (12) by pawls (13). The drive tube (23) can be releasably retained in a rearward position by a trigger mechanism (26). When released, the drive tube (23) urges the plunger (11), capsule (5) and carrier (4) forwards to project the needle (8). The liquid charge acts effectively as a solid. With the carrier (4) stopped, the plunger (11) carries on to eject a dose, clicking past the carrier pawls (13). The re-prime, the knob (24) is pulled to retract the drive tube (23) and the carrier (4), the lost motion connection (18, 19) allowing the drive tube (23) to move further and have its pawls (21) click back along the plunger (11) until the trigger mechanism (26) re-engages.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to injection devices.Often, when a sequence of injections is carried out,
each time the entire contents of a capsule are ejected
through the needle in a single stroke of a plunger. However,
there are other circumstances where only a small amount of
fluid should be used, and it is not always practical or
economic to make a number of very small capsules and
injection devices to cater for this. There is therefore a
need for an injection device which can produce repeated
measured doses from a single capsule.DE-A-3638984 describes an injection device in which the
dose to be administered can be set, the device 'fired', the
needle replaced, and the device re-primed, if desired with
a different setting for the dose. The cycle can be repeated
until the syringe is exhausted or has insufficient for
another shot. The sophistication of being able to adjust
the dose leads to a complicated construction. The adjustment
is done by a wheel which is rotated through a number of
"clicks" corresponding to the size of dose required, and
then by an adjacent knob which is rotated, until stopped at
a position determined by the wheel, to screw forwards a
plunger that will actuate the syringe. This is done with
the device primed, the member into which the plunger screws
being retracted against a powerful spring and held by a
trigger clip mounted next to the dosage setting wheel.
DE-A-3715258 describes a similar device.There is clearly a risk, due to the proximity of the 
dose setting elements and the trigger clip, that the device
will be fired prematurely, while the user is trying to set
it up. But in practice such elaboration is not always
necessary. Most injections are repeats of previous ones,
the same dose being administered each time.EP-A-0037696 describes an injection device with a
simple plunger and ratchet mechanism by which the plunger is
urged forwards on each actuation by a preset distance, thus
dispensing a set dose. However, the syringe is fixed and
the needle permanently projects from the forward end of the
barrel. This requires the user to push the whole device in
order to make the needle penetrate the flesh, which is often
very difficult for a person self-administering an injection.
It is preferable to have the needle 'fired' from a retracted
position, as in DE 3638984.The aim of this invention is an injection device
capable of generating repeated doses from a syringe, in
which the dose is pre-set into the construction of the
device and there is no need for any adjustments. The device
is

<CLAIMS>
An injection device with an elongate barrel-like
body (1) for giving a sequence of injections of liquid from

a capsule (5), the capsule (5) being carried therein in a
manner allowing longitudinal movement between limiting

positions, and having a needle (8) at one, forward end and
a piston (6) actuable through the other, rear end, the

device comprising a plunger (11), to cooperate with the
piston (6) and which is actuable to cause emission of doses

through the needle (8), spring drive means (23,29) with a
limited travel which, when energised, engages the plunger

(11) at a first position thereon and which, when released,
urges it forwardly, the drive in a first phase carrying the

capsule (5) from a rear to a forward limit, by virtue of a
substantial hydraulic lock, to project the needle (8) from

the body, and in a second phase forcing the piston (6) alone
on to eject a dose, manually operable priming means (24) to

re-energise the drive means (23,29), and means (25,28) for
releasably holding the spring drive means (23,29) energised

after priming, characterised in that the plunger (11) has
ratchet teeth (12) and the drive means (23,29) has a pawl

(21) to engage therewith positively in the drive direction,
in that the capsule (5) is mounted in a carrier (4) capable

of limited longitudinal movement within the body and having
a pawl (13) to engage the ratchet teeth (12), and in that

there is a lost motion connection (18,19) between the
carrier (4) and the drive means (23,29), the arrangement 

being such that the drive means, on being re-energised,
withdraws the carrier (4) with the capsule (5) to its rear

limit but, by virtue of the lost motion connection (18,19),
withdraws the drive means (23,29) further for its pawl (21)

to have its engagement with the teeth (12) shifted to the
rear, such that in the first phase of the drive stroke the

capsule (5) and its carrier (4) are moved forwards together
until arrested, and such that in the second phase of the

drive stroke, the drive pawl (21) continues to thrust the
plunger (11) forwards, the lost motion connection (18,19)

allowing relative movement between the drive means (23,29)
and the carrier (4), whereby the carrier pawl (13) has its

engagement with the teeth (12) shifted to the rear.
An injection device as claimed in Claim 1,
characterised in that the drive means (23,29) includes a

tubular member (23) sleeved over the plunger (11) with coil
spring means (29) encircling it and effectively reacting

against the body (1).
An injection device as claimed in Claim 2,
characterised in that the priming means is a knob (24) on

the end of the tubular member (23) accessible at the rear
end of the body (1).
An injection device as claimed in Claim 2 or 3,
characterised in that the means (25,28) for releasably

holding the drive means (23,29) is a trigger device (26)
carried by the body (1) and arranged to engage a detent (25)

on the tubular member (23) when that member is withdrawn
rearwardly from the body to a predetermined extent. 
An injection device as claimed in Claim 4,
characterised in that the trigger device (26) comprises

diametrically opposed pads (27) accessible outside the body
(1) and connected by springy webs (28) within the body which

encircle the tubular member (23) to engage diametrically
opposed detents (25) on that member when withdrawn, squeezing

of the pads (27) together causing the webs (28) to
diverge and release from the detents (25).
An injection device as claimed in Claim 4 or 5,
characterised in that the or each detent (25) has a snap

action engagement with the trigger device (26) when the
tubular member (23) reaches its predetermined withdrawn

position.
