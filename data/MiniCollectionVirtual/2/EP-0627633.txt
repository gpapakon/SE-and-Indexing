<ABSTRACT>
Nuclear or electron spin magnetic resonance method using multiple radial 
scans through frequency-space. The problem of insufficient sample density at the higher 

image frequencies is solved by deriving an edge image, determining a correction image 
therefrom by using a priori knowledge about the pixel value distribution and using the 

correction image after Fourier transformation to frequency-space.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention pertains to a method for deriving a magnetic resonance 
image of an object placed in a stationary and substantially homogeneous magnetic main 
field, comprising repeatedly exciting said object and sampling magnetic resonance signals 
in the presence of a read gradient superimposed on said main field thereby 
determining a first frequency image of said object on spherical or polar coordinates by 
radially scanning through frequency-space. The invention also pertains to an apparatus to perform such method. A method as described in the preamble is known from the US Patent 
4,070,411. In said patent is disclosed that magnetic resonance signals are induced in an 
object, notably a patient, present in a homogeneous magnetic field and are detected 
while exposing the region of the object to be imaged to a linear gradient superimposed 
on the homogeneous magnetic field. A resonance spectrum is obtained for each of a 
relatively large number of angularly displaced orientations of the linear gradient. The 
image is constructed by a mathematical process of back projection. This technique uses 
the fact that the Fourier transform of a one-dimensional projection of the spin density 
represents a one-dimensional cross-section of the three-dimensional Fourier transform of 
the spin density function. In the article "NMR Imaging Methods Seen as Trajectories in the 
Reciprocal Space" in Bull. Magnetic Resonance, 6, No. 3, Nov. 1984, p. 140-141, 
is 
disclosed that the values of the magnetic resonance signal S(t) fundamentally correspond 
to the values of the Fourier transform of the spin density function in frequency-space 
at 
positions given by 
dk/dt=γG 
, 
k=(kx,ky,kz)  
 determining the position in frequency-space 
(also called k-space), 
G=(Gx,Gy,Gz)  
 determining the magnetic gradient, and γ being the 
gyromagnetic ratio. So, in a method as described in the preamble, the values of a frequency 
image of an image to be produced are found as values of the detected signal assigned  
 
to points along a radial line in frequency-space. In US 4,070,611 mentioned above is explained that radially scanning 
through frequency-space has the distinct disadvantage that information is collected in an 
inhomgeneous way, i.e. because of the radial scanning the information is more dense 
near the origin of frequency-space, representing the lower frequencies, and there may 
be insufficient information of the higher image frequencies. In US 4,070,611 a method 
is disclosed in which frequency-space is scanned along
