<ABSTRACT>
An image forming apparatus includes a photosensitive 
drum rotatable, a developer disposed near the photosensitive 

drum for developing an electrostatic latent image into a 
toner image, a transfer disposed on a downstream of the 

developer for transferring the toner image onto copy paper, 
and a pre-transfer charger disposed between the developer 

and the transfer for charging the photosensitive drum at a 

specified level to assure a smooth transfer of the toner 
image from the photosensitive drum to the copy paper. the

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an image forming 
apparatus provided with a pre-transfer charger to improve 
the efficiency in transferring a toner image onto a copy 
sheet. Generally, an image forming apparatus comprises a toner 
image forming unit for forming a toner image, and a toner 
image transferring device for transferring the toner image 
onto a copy sheet dispensed from a cassette. The toner 
image forming unit has a photosensitive drum. Specifically, 
the copy sheet is transported near a surface of the photosensitive 
drum and the toner image is transferred onto the 
copy sheet from the photosensitive drum. The copy sheet is 
then discharged from the apparatus after the toner image is 
fixed on the copy sheet by a fixing unit. Recently, there have been marketed image forming apparatus 
which are provided with a charger before a toner image 
transferring device to improve the transferring efficiency 
of toner image from the surface of the photosensitive drum 
onto the copy sheet. Such a charger has been generally 
called a pre-transfer charger. Fig. 14 is a schematic diagram showing an arrangement  
 
of a photosensitive drum and its peripheral devices in a 
conventional image forming apparatus. A surface of a photosensitive 
drum 10 is positively charged at a specified level 
by a main charger 11, and exposed to a light image A reflected 
from an original document to form an electrostatic 
latent image. Thereafter, an unnecessary area of the 
charged surface of the photosensitive drum 10 is removed by 
a blank lamp 12. There is provided a developing device 13 containing 
negatively charged toner particles. Negatively charged 
toner particles are electrically attracted to the positive 
latent image on the photosensitive drum surface to develop a 
toner image. In synchronism with the exposure and developing operations, 
a copy sheet is transported to the photosensitive 
drum 10 by a pair of registration rollers 24. The copy 
sheet is guided through a sheet transport passage 25 up to 
the surface of the photosensitive drum 10. The sheet transport 
passage 25 is constructed by an upper guide plate and a 
lower guide plate. Upon being transported to the surface of 
the photosensitive drum 10, the copy sheet is applied with 
positive electric charges by a transferring device 14 to 
transfer the toner image onto the copy sheet from the photosensitive 
drum 10. The copy sheet bearing the toner image 
is separated from the surface of the photosensitive drum 10  
 
by a separating device 15 which is
