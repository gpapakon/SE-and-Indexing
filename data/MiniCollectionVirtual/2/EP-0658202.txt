<ABSTRACT>
A eukaryotic cell transformed with a DNA construct comprising a coding sequence encoding a polypeptide having the activity of a mammalian phospholipid kinase or a mammalian protein kinase activated by a phospholipid or its metabolite and regulatory elements to allow transcription of the coding sequence in the said cell wherein the regulatory elements include a repressible or inducible promoter and the expression of the said coding sequence is lethal or growth inhibitory to the cell. In a preferred embodiment the cells are (Schizosaccharomyce pombe). The cells are used as the basis of an assay for compounds involved in cell growth regulation. Such compounds can be used to treat cancers and the formation of blood vessel plaques.

<DESCRIPTION>
 EUCARYOTIC CELLS TRANSFORMED WITH A Mf ftLIAN PHOSPHOLIPID KINASEOR PROTEIN KINASE AND ASSAYS USING THEMThe present invention relates to assays for compounds involved in cell growth regulation, and more particularly to those involved in transducing signals from hormones, growth factors and oncogenes. Such compounds represent potential drugs or targets for drugs to treat cancers and to prevent the formation of plaques which cause heart disease.Phosphatidylinositol 3-OH kinase (Ptdlns 3-kinase) catalyses the phosphorylation of the 3-hydroxyl of inositol in Ptdlns, PtdIns-4-phosphate or in PtdIns-4,5-bisphosphate. This activity is involved in transducing signals from a number of hormones, growth factors and oncogenes. The standard assay for the activity of the Ptdlns 3-kinase involving lipid moieties does not readily lend itself to a screen for potential inhibitors (or activators) of catalytic function. Members of the protein kinase C family of enzymes are involved in transducing signals from a number of hormones, growth factors and oncogenes. The standard assay for protein kinase C does not lend itself to a screen for potential inhibitors (or activators) of catalytic function.Thus it has been desirable to investigate other means of searching for inhibitors.A first aspect of the invention provides a eukaryotic cell transformed with a DNA construct comprising a coding sequence encoding a polypeptide having the activity of a mammalian phospholipid kinase or a mammalian protein kinase activated by a phospholipid or its metabolite and regulatory elements to allow transcription of the coding sequence in the said cell wherein the regulatory elements include a repressible or inducible promoter and the expression of the said coding sequence is lethal or growth inhibitory to the cell. 

Polypeptides having the activity of a phospholipid kinase or a protein kinase activated by a phospholipid or its metabolite are involved in cell growth regulation.By "growth inhibitory" we mean that the growth rate of cells transformed with the said DNA construct is at least two to three fold lower than the same cells not transformed with the said DNA construct when grown in the same culture conditions.By "repressible" we mean that in the presence of a repressing agent the expression from the promoter is at least two-fold lower than expression from the promoter in the absence of the repressing agent.It is preferred if expression from the promoter in the presence of a repressing agent is at least five-fold lower, more preferably
