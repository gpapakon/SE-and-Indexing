<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a heat transfer image-receiving
sheet, and more particularly to a heat transfer
image-receiving sheet which can remarkably reduce troubles
during conveyance thereof in a printer.Heretofore, a heat transfer sheet comprising a
substrate sheet and a dye layer has been used when the
output printing of a computer or a word processor is
conducted by a sublimation-type heat transfer printing
method. This heat transfer sheet has a substrate sheet
which is heat resistant, and a dye layer which is formed on
the substrate sheet in such a manner that an ink prepared
by mixing a sublimable dye and a binder is coated onto the
substrate sheet and then dried. When heat is applied to
the back surface of the heat transfer sheet by a thermal
head, a large number of color dots of three or four colors
are transferred to an image-receiving sheet. A
multicolored image is thus produced on the image-receiving
sheet. Since a dye is used in the heat transfer sheet as
a coloring agent, the image produced is very sharp and
clear. In addition, a half-tone image with good gradation
can be obtained with high reproducibility. Thus, a high
quality image comparable to a multicolored photographic
image can be obtained.The above mentioned image-receiving sheet generally
comprises a substrate sheet and a dye-receptive layer. An
image-receiving sheet has recently been employed which has
a substrate sheet composed of an ordinary paper and a resin
film laminated on the paper. Such an image-receiving
sheet, whose substrate sheet is composed of paper and a
resin which are completely different in the degree of heat
shrinkage from each other, is very likely to curl. There
is often a case where an image-receiving sheet is already 
curled to a considerable degree when it is placed in the
sheet-feed section of a printer. In this case, the image-receiving
sheet is likely, to cause troubles while it is
conveyed in a printer, which makes it difficult to stably
receive an image on the sheet. EP-A3-0 348 157 teaches a support sheet for a thermal transfer image-receiving
sheet comprising a sheet substrate and multilayer front and back surface coating
plastic films bonded to the sheet substrate, said front and back surface coating
plastic films each comprising a pigment and olefin resin, and wherein the heat
shrinkage of the front surface film is less than or equal to half the heat shrinkage
of the back surface coating film. Contrary to the general teaching of this
document, the support sheet in Example 5 of this document is stated

A heat transfer image-receiving sheet comprising a substrate sheet and a
dye-receptive layer,


the substrate sheet comprising a core substrate; a first resin layer formed on
one surface of the core substrate, on which layer the dye-receptive layer is

formed; and a second resin layer formed on the other surface of the core substrate,
the difference in the degree of heat shrinkage between the first resin layer
and the second resin layer being in the range of 0.4% to 2.0%, said degree of

heat shrinkage determined by preparing a sample having dimensions of 12cm x
12cm, putting two marks on the sample in the longer direction at an interval of

100mm, allowing the sample to stand horizontally at 120°C for 5 minutes, then
cooling the sample in air to room temperature, measuring the distance between the

two marks, and then calculating the difference of the measured distance and
100mm as a percentage of 100mm, and
the degree of heat shrinkage of the first resin layer being higher than that of
the second resin layer,
provided that the first and second resin layers do not simultaneously have
heat shrinkages of 2% and 0.35% respectively, said heat shrinkages being determined

at 100∓2°C for 10 minutes in accordance with JIS K-6734-1975.6.6
Heat Shrinkage Test.
The heat transfer image-receiving sheet according to claim 1, further comprising
an intermediate layer between the substrate sheet and the dye-receptive

layer.
A method for reducing troubles during conveyance of a heat transfer image-receiving
sheet in such a type of printer that sheets are to be set in a sheet-feed 

tray of the printer with the dye-receptive layer of the sheets downward, which
comprises feeding to the printer a heat transfer image receiving sheet which

comprises a substrate sheet and a dye-receptive layer,

the substrate sheet comprising a core substrate; a first resin layer formed on
one surface of the co
re substrate, on which layer the dye-receptive layer is
formed; and a second resin layer formed on the other surface of the core substrate,
wherein the difference in the degree of heat shrinkage between the first
resin layer and the second resin layer is in the range of 0.4% to 2.0%, said degree

of heat shrinkage determined by preparing a sample having dimensions of 12cm x
12cm, putting two marks on the sample in the longer direction at an interval of

100mm, allowing the sample to stand horizontally at 120°C for 5 minutes, then
cooling the sample in air to room temperature, measuring the distance between the

two marks, and then calculating the difference of the measured distance and
100mm as a percentage of 100mm, and
the degree of heat shrinkage of the first resin layer is higher than that of the
second resin layer.
The method according to claim 3 wherein the printer has a thermal head and
a platen roll in the image-transfer section, and the sheets pass between the

thermal head and the platen roll while they travel around the platen roll to the
extent of approximately 1/4-3/4 of the circumference thereof.
