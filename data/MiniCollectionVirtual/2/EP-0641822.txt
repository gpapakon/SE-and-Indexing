<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a thermoplastic
resin composition improved in stability of
polyphenylene ether resin at the time of processing.Polyphenylene ether resin is a thermoplastic
resin superior in various characteristics such as
mechanical properties, heat resistance and dimensional
stability. However, it is apt to undergo coloration and
deteriorations such as crosslinking when processed at
high temperatures. Especially, in the presence of
oxygen, it undergoes serious deterioration due to the
heat to cause gelation or sometimes produce black
specks. Furthermore, polyphenylene ether resin readily
undergoes discoloration with light.In order to offset these defects of the resin,
it has been proposed to add various additives. For
example, phosphorus additives are proposed in Japanese
Patent Kokoku No. 44-29751 and phenolic additives are
proposed in Japanese Patent Kokoku No. 46-24782. Furthermore,
many attempts such as use of various compounds
including steric hindrance type amines or use of
compounds including steric hindrance type amines and
phenolic additives in combination have been made mainly
for inhibition of the discoloration with light as
disclosed in Japanese Patent Kokai Nos. 60-149646 and
60-203150, U.S. Patent Nos. 4232131, 4233410, 4233412,
4234699, 4260689, 4260691 and 4299926, EP0094048A2,
EP0134523A1, EP0146879A2, EP0146878A2, EP0151961A1,
EP0149454A2, EP0233153A2, EP0240723A2, EP0229363A2, and
EP0313118A1. Many of these attempts are for improving
evaporation at the time of processing or actual use, and
various compounds containing steric hindrance type amines
alone or copolymers (oligomers) with other components have 
been proposed. However, none of these proposals have
provided sufficient effects to inhibit deterioration at
heating.The present invention relates to a composition
inhibited from deterioration of the polyphenylene ether
at the time of processing, especially with heat.The inventors have found that a conspicuous
effect to inhibit the deterioration with heat can be
obtained by adding a compound containing steric hindrance
type amine having a specific structure to polyphenylene
ether resins.The present invention relates to a thermoplastic
resin composition comprising (a) 100 parts by
weight of a polyphenylene ether and (b) 0.001-15 parts by
weight of at least one 4-amino-2,2,6,6-tetramethylpiperidyl
compound represented by the following formula
(I) or (II).
