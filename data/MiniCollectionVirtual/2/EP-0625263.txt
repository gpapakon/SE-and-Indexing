<DESCRIPTION>
 "Contrast Agents Useful for both X-Ray and MRI"This invention relates to novel agents for4 enhancing diagnostic imaging and more particularly to novel compositions, methods of preparing the compositions and5 methods of using the compositions for enhancing both x-ray images and magnetic resonance images for in vivo diagnostic imaging of body organs and tissues.BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTIONThe techniques of magnetic resonance imaging 10 (MRI) encompass the detection of certain atomic nuclei utilizing magnetic fields and radio-frequency radiation. MRI is similar in some respects to x-ray computed tomography (CT) in providing a cross-sectional display of the body organ anatomy with excellent resolution of soft 15 tissue detail. In current use, the images produced constitute a map of the distribution density of protons and/or their relaxation times in organs and tissues. The MRI technique is advantageously non-invasive as it avoids the use of ionizing radiation.20 While the phenomenon of MRI was discovered in1945, it is only relatively recently that it has found application as a means of mapping the internal structure of the body as a result of the original suggestion of Lauterbur (Nature, 242, 190-191, 1973). The lack of any25 known hazard associated with the level of the magnetic and radio-frequency fields that are employed renders it"*> possible to make repeated scans on vulnerable individuals.Additionally, any scan plane can readily be selected& including transverse, coronal, and sagittal sections.30 In a MRI experiment, the nuclei under study in a sample (e.g. protons) are irradiated with the appropriate radio-frequency (RF) energy in a highly uniform magnetic 

field. These nuclei as they relax subsequently emit RF radiation at a sharp resonant frequency. The emitted frequency (RF) of the nuclei depends on the applied magnetic field.According to known principles, nuclei with appropriate spin when placed in an applied magnetic field [B, expressed generally in units of gauss or tesla (104 gauss) ] align in the direction of the field. In the case of protons, these nuclei precess at a frequency f=42.6 MHz at a field strength of 1 Tesla. At this frequency, an RF pulse of radiation will excite the nuclei and can be considered to tip the nuclei out of the field direction, the extent of this rotation being determined by the pulse duration and energy. After the RF pulse, the nuclei "relax" or return to equilibrium with the magnetic field, emitting radiation at the resonant frequency. The decay of the signal is
