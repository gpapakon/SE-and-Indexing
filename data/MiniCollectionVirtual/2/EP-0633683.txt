<ABSTRACT>
An improved telephone system (1) is controlled by an 
information processor (20) adapted to receive and transmit 

signals indicating various operating states of an associated 
telephone unit (10). Hook i
nformation is transmitted such that 
a distinction can be made between on-hook and off-hook states 

of the handset (15) of the telephone, enabling automatic 
logging of calls and automatic registering of telephone numbers 

in a directory. Data indicating the occurrence of data 
communication on the data network (4) is transmitted, enabling 

voice communication on the network (4), which would interfere 
with the data communication, to be inhibited. Data indicative 

of the charging state of a battery (132) associated with the 
system, and/or the presence of unread electronic mail, is 

transmitted enabling these factors to be checked without the 
need for powering-up of the information processor (20) or 

runnning of special software. The latter data may be used to 
activate LEDs (51-53). The information processor (20) may 

include a combined display/touch screen data entry device 
(111).

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a telephone system and a 
telecommunication system for controlling and realizing a new 
function of the telephone system. More particularly, it relates 
to a telephone system and to an information processing system 
(telecommunication system) having a telephone directory 
formulating function and a data communication function. There has recently developed an information processor, such 
as a terminal for communication of personal information 
controlling a telephone set, a so-called electronic memorandum 
or a small-sized computer. It is possible with such processor to manage addresses or 
telephone numbers or to perform data communication over a 
telephone network, such as so-called electronic mail. However, 
since the telephone set and the processor are not interconnected 
so as to provide bi-directional communication, a number of 
inconveniences have been raised. For example, in the telephone number management function in 
such processor, a telephone number is stored or registered as a 
telephone directory and, when the user makes a telephone call, 
the processor opens a page in which the telephone number of the 
called party is entered and reference is had to the telephone 
number shown therein to initiate a dialling operation.  
 There is also known an information processor in which, when 
the user designates one of registered telephone numbers, such 
telephone number is transferred to the telephone set to initiate 
the dialling operation. With the above-described conventional information processor, 
if the user makes a telephone call to a party whose telephone 
number is not recorded in the telephone directory and 
subsequently intends to have the telephone number of the called 
party registered in the telephone directory, it is necessary to 
re-enter the telephone number in the information processor, which 
means a redundant operation. In addition, the conventional information processor lacks 
the function of maintaining a log (record) of, for example, 
telephone numbers of the parties to whom the user made calls in 
the past, or the telephone call time. On the other hand, in the information processor designed for 
data communication, the conventional practice has been to connect 
a modem in the telephone network to which is connected the 
telephone set, and to make the data communication over the modem. Meanwhile, if the user inadvertently makes a telephone call, 
with the telephone being off-hook, during the time data 
communication is performed, the telephone call

A telephone system wherein telephone call and 
telecommunication message transmission are performed on a common 

telephone line (4), the system comprising: 

a telephone unit (10) connected to an external telephone line (4) 
and adapted to make telephone calls via the telephone line (4); 
an information processing unit (20) adapted to transmit and/or 
receive telecommunication messages via said external telephone line (4); 

and 
means (30/61,62/121) for connecting said telephone unit (10) to 
said information processing unit (20) for bi-directionally transmitting 

data therebetween; 
characterised in that
the information processing unit (20) comprises means for 
producing a first specific signal and communicating said first specific 

signal to the telephone unit (10) via the connecting means 
(30/61,62/121), said first specific signal indicating that the 

transmission or reception of a telecommunication message by the 
information processing unit (20) is going on via the external telephone 

line (4). 
The telephone system of claim 1, wherein the telephone unit 
comprises display means (52) for providing, responsive to reception of 

said first specific signal, a visual indication that data communication is 
going on via the telephone line (4). 
The telephone system of claim 1 or 2, wherein the telephone unit 
comprises a connecting circuit (143c) for selectively connecting and 

disconnecting the telephone unit (10) from the external telephone line 

(4), wherein the connecting circuit (143c) is adapted to disconnect the 
telephone unit (10) from the external telephone line (4) when data 

communication is going on via the telephone line (4), responsive to 
reception of said first specific signal.  

 
A telecommunications method wherein telephone call and 
telecommunication message transmission are performed on a common 

telephone line (4), the method comprising the steps of: 

providing a telephone unit (10) connected to an external 
telephone line (4) and adapted to make telephone calls via the telephone 

line (4); 
providing an information processing unit (20) adapted to transmit 
and/or receive telecommunication messages via said external telephone 

line (4); and 
providing means (30/61,62/121) for connecting said telephone 
unit (10) to said information processing unit (20) for bi-directionally 

transmitting data therebetween; 
characterised by
transmitting or receiving a telecommunication message by said 
information processing unit (20) on said external telephone line (4); and 
producing a first specific signal by said information processing 
means (20) and communicating said first specific signal to the
