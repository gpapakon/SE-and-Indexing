<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method of injecting 
lubricant into a space between the outside of double-wall pipes 
and the ground in laying a conduit comprised of double-wall pipes 
each of which comprises an inner pipe and an outer pipe by 
propelling the double-wall pipes, and to a method of injecting 
filler into a space formed between inner pipes and outer pipes, 
after the conduit has been laid. Laying sewer conduit or service water conduit in the ground 
is carried out by tunneling through the ground by a tunneling 
machine, while the tunneling machine followed by pipes such as 
Hume pipes and steel pipes is propelled by a pipe-jacking 
machine, wherein it is carried out to inject lubricant into a 
space between the outside of the tunneling machine and the ground 
and between the outside of pipes and the ground. Further, in the 
above-mentioned pipe-jacking method, it is also carried out to 
inject back-filling material into a space between the outside of 
pipes forming a conduit and the ground, after having laying the 
conduit. Each of pipes with diameter over 800mm used in the 
above-mentioned pipe-jacking method is formed with a hole at a 
given position. The hole is connected through a hose with a 
lubricant or back-filling material feeder, which is provided on 
the ground. While propelling pipes, lubricant is injected into a 
space between the outside of pipes and the ground, by supplying 
lubricant through the hose to the hole and injecting lubricant to  
 
the space through the hole so that frictional force can be 
decreased, or after having laid a desired conduit in the ground, 
back-filling material is injected into a space between the 
outside of pipes and the ground so that the space between the 
outside of pipes and the ground is filled with back-filling 
material. On the other hand, there is a case where a conduit for 
supplying gas such as coal gas or fuel gas and natural gas and 
others is laid in the ground. Since a gas pipe requires the 
higher gastightness, gas pipes are connected with each other by 
mutually welding the edges of pipes, wherein the weld is 
inspected by non-destructive inspection about whether a conduit 
for supplying gas without welding defect is formed. Since in such a way, a gas pipe requires the higher 
gastightness, it is thought that a gas pipe cannot be provided 
with a hole for injecting lubricant or back-filling material to a 
space between the outside of pipes and the ground. Further, it is 
thought that the edge of gas pipe cannot be brought into
