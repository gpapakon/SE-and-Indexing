<ABSTRACT>
A paging network having a master transmitter 
(MT) and several local radio transmitters (1 - 3) is 

shown. The network is designed to allow the transmission 
of local and global messages. Global messages must be 

sent by all radio transmitters (1 - 3) synchronously. Local 
messages are only sent by a single radio transmitter. 

The master transmitter (MT) generates a signal that contains 
the global messages and sends it to the radio 

transmitters (1 - 3). If a radio transmitter has no local 
messages to be sent, it emits the unchanged signal received 

from the master transmitter. If a radio transmitter 
has one or more local messages to be added to the 

signal, it will determine if there are suitable gaps in 
the signal received from the master transmitter where the 

local messages can be included. If such gaps are found, 
the local messages are added to the signal to generate a 

modified signal which is then emitted by the radio transmitter. 
In order to allow a forward recognition of gaps 

in the signal sent by the master transmitter, special gap 
markers or allocation messages can be added. 
 
The proposed method allows to make an optimum 
use of the capacity of the available radio channel.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a method for operating 
a radio transmitter sending digital messages, which 
radio transmitter receives high priority messages from a 
first source and low priority messages from a second 
source, wherein each high priority message is to be sent 
at a predefined time. The invention also relates to a 
network for sending local and global paging calls, which 
network comprises a plurality of local radio transmitters 
and one master transmitter. In such a radio paging network, the global 
paging calls (which have highest priority) must be sent 
by all transmitters simultaneously to avoid interference 
problems between neighbouring radio transmitters. Local 
paging calls are usually restricted to the range of only 
one radio transmitter. Therefore, a radio transmitter 
sending a local paging call is not required to be synchronized 
with the other radio transmitters. EP-A 0 536 539 describes a network where the 
radio transmitters are regularly switched between a local 
and a global transmission mode. In the global transmission 
mode, all transmitters are synchronized and send out 
the global paging calls. In the local transmission mode, 
each transmitter individually sends its local paging 
calls and is not synchronized with the other transmitters. 
The transmission of the global calls ends before 
the transmission of the local calls starts. Each transmission 
requires a completely new transmission sequence, 
independent of the previous transmissions. Furthermore, 
it is found that in this system there are unused gaps in 
the transmissions. These gaps occur because in existing 
standard paging codes such as POCSAG and ERMES, messages  
 
can only start at certain times, which are defined by the 
receiver's address. In a very large system with a variety 
of lengths of messages, these spaces are unusual. In 
small systems, however, which have only a few addresses, 
it is more likely that gaps occur. In systems where a few 
addresses are often used this problem may become severe, 
resulting in an inefficient use of the radio channel. Hence, it is a general object of the invention 
to provide a method and a network of the kind mentioned 
above that do not show these disadvantages and allow 
an efficient use of the radio channel. Now, in order to implement these and still 
further objects of the invention, which will become more 
readily apparent as the description proceeds, the invention 
is manifested by the features as described in the 
independent claims. By placing the local, low

A method for operating a radio transmitter 
(1, 2, 3) sending digital messages, which radio transmitter 

receives high priority messages (1a - 1e) from a 
first source (MT) and low priority messages (2a - 2g) 

from a second source (L1, L2, L3), wherein each high priority 
message is to be sent at a predefined time, characterized 

in that gaps between the high priority messages 
are determined and each low priority message is inserted 

in a gap of sufficient length. 
The method as claimed in claim 1, characterized 
in that a global signal (10, 13, 15) is fed to 

the radio transmitter, which global signal contains the 
high priority messages and substantially corresponds to 

the signal to be emitted by the radio transmitter in the 
absence of low priority messages. 
The method as claimed in claim 2, characterized 
in that at least part of the global signal (10, 

13, 15) is buffered by the radio transmitter for a predefined 
time, wherein the buffered part of the global 

signal is searched for gaps not used for the high priority 
messages and wherein the low priority messages are 

placed in these gaps. 
The method as claimed in one of the claims 
2 or 3, characterized in that gaps in the global signal 

(13, 15) fed to the radio transmitter are filled with 
predefined gap markers. 
The method as claimed in claim 4, characterized 
in that each gap marker indicates its distance 

from the end of the gap. 
The method as claimed in one of the claims 
2 - 5, characterized in that the global signal (13) fed 

to the radio transmitter contains at least one allocation 
 

message (16), which allocation message describes the 
lengths and positions of gaps in the following global 

signal.
