<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to an optical amplifier doped with lanthanide 
ions. Such an optical amplifier is known from EP-A2-0 437 935, which 
describes an optical amplifier composed of an erbium3+ doped fibre. 
The erbium ions are excited with the aid of a laser, giving a fibre 
containing a large number of excited Er3+ ions. When optical beams 
(photons) having the same wavelength as the emission wavelength of the 
excited Er3+ ions traverse the fibre, they effect the transition of 
the ions from the excited state to a lower energy level with 
transmission of light. As has been mentioned, this light will have the 
same wavelength and phase as the photons traversing the fibre. Such a 
process is called stimulated emission. In this way the light beams are 
amplified, with the optical fibre acting as amplifier. The optical amplifier as specified in EP-A2-0 437 935 is a glass 
fibre. For several years efforts have been made in the industry to 
replace optical glass fibres with optical polymeric material. Optical 
polymeric fibres have several advantages over optical glass fibres. 
They can be made by less complicated spinning processes and can easily 
be cut to the required size and attached to receiving and transmitting 
devices. Also, they are lighter and more flexible than glass fibres. 
An attendant advantage is that the shape of optical polymeric material 
need not be restricted to fibres. The polymeric material can also be 
shaped into so-called flat waveguides. In the remainder of the 
description the term optical waveguides refers to both fibres and flat 
waveguides. So far, it has not proved possible to replace lanthanide doped optical 
amplifiers with optical amplifiers of polymeric material. This is 
because polymeric waveguides cannot be doped with lanthanides just 
like that, without introducing co-doping with water. For, trivalent 
lanthanide ions are highly hygroscopic. In consequence, when 
lanthanide ions are doped, water of crystallisation which is present  
 
on the lanthanide salt is also introduced into the waveguide. 
Alternatively, lanthanide ions already present in the waveguide may 
interact with water or other OH-containing impurities. Water and other 
OH-containing impurities quench the excited state of the trivalent 
lanthanide ions. So, unless further steps are taken, a lanthanide 
doped optical polymeric waveguide will not have the above-indicated 
amplification, or have it in insufficient degree. Furthermore, light 
is absorbed to such an extent by OH-groups that polymeric
