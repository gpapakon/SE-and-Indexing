<ABSTRACT>
Device for sealing pits, consisting of a horizontal frame 
(2) and cover means (3) fitting in this frame (2), 

characterized in that the frame (2) has two concentric 
ducts (4, 5) which can each contain an amount of liquid 

(6); in that the cover means (3) have two ribs (7, 8) on 
their bottom sides which extend into the concentric ducts 

(4, 5) as the cover means (3) are applied, whereby these 
ducts and ribs are made such that two liquid seals (9, 

10) are created with an inclusion of air (11) in between 
which can prevent liquid (6) from entering in the pit; in 

that the outer rib (7) rests in the outer duct (4); and 
in that the outer rib (7) serves as a support for at 

least the part of the cover means (3) which serves as 
bearing surface (13).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention concerns a device for sealing pits,
in particular a device which consists of a horizontal
frame and cover means fitting in the frame, such as a
lid.It is known that devices for sealing pits can be provided
with odour seals. These usually consist of grooves in
the form of ducts which are provided in the above-mentioned
frames and ribs on the bottom side of the lids
which extend into the above-mentioned ducts, one and
other such that when the ducts are filled with water, a
barrier is formed for the odour rising from the pit.For certain applications it is also desirable that the
pit lids can seal in a watertight manner. This is among
other the case in control rooms which are situated above
the lid of a tank, such as a fuel oil tank. In order to
provide for such a watertight seal, various solutions
have already been suggested, including the use of elastic
sealing rings.The known devices for sealing pits, whereby an odour seal
and/or a seal to prevent the penetration of liquid, such
as rain water, is provided (see EP-A-0 390 767), are all disadvantageous in
that they no longer meet the above-mentioned requirements
after some time, especially when the pit lids used hereby
are heavily loaded, for example by vehicles driving over
them. Many of the usual defects hereby arise as the pit
lids bend and the seatings, where the lids rest in the 
frames, are damaged. This phenomenon particularly occurs
with synthetic lids.Also, the present invention aims a device for sealing
pits which does not have the above-mentioned
disadvantages, in other words whereby an optimum sealing
is provided on the one hand, in order to prevent that
odour escapes and/or that liquid seeps in the pit, and
whereby damages to the seal arising under an extremely
heavy load are optimally excluded on the other hand, even
when the frames and lids are made of synthetic material
and when the load is more than 12 tons.To this end, the invention concerns a device for sealing
pits, consisting of a horizontal frame and cover means
fitting in this frame, characterized in that the frame
has two concentric ducts which can each contain an amount
of liquid; in that the cover means have two ribs on their
bottom sides which extend into the concentric ducts as
the cover means are applied, whereby the ducts and ribs
are made such that two liquid seals are created with an
inclusion of air in between which prevents liquid from
entering; in that the outer rib rests in the outer duct,
preferably on the bottom thereof; in that the outer
rib

characterized in that the base (16) of the frame (2)

extends under the outer rib (7) of the cover means (3).
Device according to any of the above claims,
characterized in that the cover means (3) consist of one

single lid (14), onto whose bottom side both above-mentioned
ribs (7, 8) are provided.
Device according to any of claims 1 to 5,
characterized in that the cover means (3) consist of two

lids (24, 25) situated on top of one another, whereby the
