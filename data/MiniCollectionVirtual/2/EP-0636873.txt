<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a device for collecting dust, for particles contained in aerosols, by means of virtual impactors, at least one virtual impactor (4) having a first filter (7) arranged after the outlet opening, and an end nozzle (6) having an end filter (9) arranged after the outlet opening being arranged, one after the other in a housing (3), concentrically about an axis (21) forming the through-flow direction, having an inlet (2), for the aerosol flow, arranged on the housing, and outlets for the separated particle flows.

Dust collecting device for particles contained in aerosols
by means of virtual impactors in which device there are arranged

one behind the other in a housing (3) at least one virtual
impactor (4) with a centrally perforated first filter (7) which

is arranged after the discharge opening of its reverse nozzle
and which surrounds the subsequent nozzle concentrically, and a

final nozzle (6) with a final filter (9), which is arranged
after its discharge opening, is arranged concentrically around

the axis (21) forming the direction of through-flow, and there
are available an inlet (2) arranged in the housing for the

aerosol flow and outlets for the separated partial flows.
Dust collecting device according to claim 1,

characterised in that

two virtual impactors (4, 5) with two filters (7, 8) are
present.
Dust collecting device according to claim 1 or 2,

characterised in that

the virtual impactors (4, 5) and the nozzle (6) with the filters
(7, 8, 9) are arranged rotationally symmetrically around the

axis (21).
Dust collecting device according to claim 1 to 3,

characterised in that

the filters (7, 8, 9) are glass filters.
Dust collecting device according to claim 4,

characterised in that the glass filters are integrated in
commercially available filter cassettes.
Dust collecting device according to claim 1 to 5,

characterised in that

the respective undersides of the filters (7, 8, 9) are connected
to the outlets (16, 17, 18) via frits (22, 23, 24). 
Dust collecting device according to claim 1 to 6,

characterised in that

in front of the outlets (16, 17, 18) there are arranged nozzles
for drawing off the partial flows, especially capillary nozzles

(12, 13, 14) for adjusting the volume flows.
Application of a device according to claim 1 to 7 for
separating particles contained in aerosols, an aerosol flow Q

being directed via the inlet into the virtual impactor and a
separation into partial flows being effected by the virtual

impactor and the nozzle, the partial flows being directed
through the filters to the outlets.
Application of a device according to claim 8,

characterised in that

the aerosol flow Q is divided into three partial flows Q, Q and
Q by two impactors and a nozzle.
Application of a device according to claim 8 and 9

characterised in that

the volume flows of the partial flows are adjusted via capillary
nozzles by a pump connected to the dust collecting device.
