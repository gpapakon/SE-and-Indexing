<ABSTRACT>
Coupling capacitors (C1-C3) are connected between an 
input end (1) and an output end (2), a resonator (R1, R2) 

is connected between each of the coupling capacitor and 
the ground, and a capacitor (C4, C5) and a switch (S4, S5) 

are connected between one end of each resonator and the 
ground. When the capacitor is off, the frequency is set 

to the resonance frequency of the resonator, and when the 
switch is turned on, the capacitor is connected parallel 

to the resonator, so that the resonance frequency is 
shifted to a lower value, whereby a dielectric filter 

having multiple frequencies can be obtained.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a dielectric filter. 
More specifically, the present invention relates to a 
dielectric filter in which a capacitor or an inductance is 
connected in parallel to a dielectric resonator by means 
of a switch, so as to provide multiple frequencies by the 
switching of the switch. Fig. 1 shows a conventional dielectric filter. 
Referring to Fig. 1, coupling capacitors C1, C2 and C3 are 
connected in series between input and output terminals, a 
resonator R1 is connected between a node between coupling 
capacitors C1 and C2 and the ground, and a resonator R2 is 
connected between a node between coupling capacitors C2 
and C3 and the ground. Fig. 2 shows frequency-amplitude characteristic of 
the dielectric resonator shown in Fig. 1. The bandpass 
filter characteristic of the dielectric filter shown in 
Fig. 1 has one central frequency f₀, as shown in Fig. 2. 
Therefore, the dielectric filter cannot freely select the 
central frequency other than that. Fig. 3 is a schematic diagram showing a conventional  
 
duplex type dielectric filter. The duplex type dielectric 
filter shown in Fig. 3 includes a transmitting side 
dielectric filter 11, a receiving side dielectric filter 
12, a matching circuit 13 connected between the 
transmitting side filter 11 and an antenna terminal ANT, 
and a matching circuit 14 connected between the receiving 
side dielectric filter 12 and antenna terminal ANT. 
Transmitting side dielectric filter 11 is structured in 
the similar manner as the dielectric filter shown in Fig. 
1. Receiving side dielectric filter 12 is also structured 
in the same manner, and includes coupling capacitors C11, 
C12 and C13 as well as resonators R3 and R4. In the duplex type dielectric filter shown in Fig. 3, 
the characteristic of the transmitting side dielectric 
filter 11 and the receiving side dielectric filter 12 has 
one central frequency f₀ as shown in Fig. 2. It is 
necessary to provide two bandpass filter circuits, that 
is, transmitting side and receiving side dielectric 
filters 11 and 12, and also to provide matching circuits 
13 and 14 for matching these with the impedance of the 
antenna. Therefore, the required number of parts is 
considerably large. Therefore, the present invention aims to 
provide a dielectric filter which allows selection of  
 
multiple frequencies. Briefly stated, the present invention provides a 
dielectric filter formed of at least one dielectric 
resonator, and including a reactance element having one 
end connected to one end of
