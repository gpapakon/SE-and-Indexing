<ABSTRACT>
A magnetic recording system for recording signals onto a 
coat-type magnetic tape using magnetic powder by using a magnetic 

head, and a magnetic recording system for recording signals onto 
a coat-type magnetic
 disk using magnetic powder by running a 
magnetic head in contact with the disk, are disclosed. The 

magnetic tape has a coercive force Hc of 2000 to 3300 Oe in the 
former system, while the magnetic disk has a coercive force Hc 

of 2000 to 3500 Oe in the latter system. In both systems, 
signals are recorded by using a magnetic head using magnetic core 

members (1,2) having a saturation magnetic flux density of 15 kG or 
greater. The magnetic core member having the saturation magnetic 

flux density of 15 kG or greater is exemplified by a material 
expressed by a composition formula

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a magnetic recording system for
writing various information signals onto a magnetic tape or a
magnetic disk, and particularly to a novel magnetic recording
system to realize high recording density and high reliability.In the recording system using the magnetic tape, the
combination of the magnetic tape and the magnetic head has
evolved in the order of a γ-Fe2O3 coat-type tape and a ferrite
head, CrO2 and a ferrite head, Co-γ-Fe2O3 and a ferrite head,
metallic powder and a sendust head or amorphous head, and a CoNi
evaporation tape and a sendust head or amorphous head, to achieve
high density magnetic recording.This evolution depends largely upon evolution of the
magnetic recording medium. Stated differently, as the coercive
force and the residual magnetic flux density of the magnetic
recording medium have increased, reproduction output in a shorter
wavelength region is improved. Thus, higher density is achieved.As a novel recording system, a combination of a Co-Cr
vertical magnetic recording medium and a vertical magnetic head,
or a combination of a ring head and a Co-O vertical magnetic
recording medium, is proposed as in the 79th Studies of Japan
Applied Magnetics Institute, Reference 79-2, pages 9 to 16.However, any of the above combinations has a problem in the 
rubbing surface between the magnetic tape and the magnetic head.
The rubbing surface between the magnetic tape and the magnetic
head does not exhibit satisfactory durability and is damaged by
the medium.Thus, the vertical magnetic recording using Co-Cr and the
like has not overcome the problem in reliability for the novel
magnetic recording medium.Meanwhile, an attempt to raise the coercive force Hc of the
magnetic tape in an in-plane medium is described in the 79th
Studies of Japan Applied Magnetics Institute, Reference 79-2,
page 15, from line 9, as follows: "By arraying acicular particles
of an average coercive force of approximately 238,7 kA/m (3000 Oe) having
similar particle diameter and size, densely and without having
magnetic interaction in the longitudinal direction to have a
thickness of tens of nm, information can be written with ultra
high resolution of 10,000 bits/mm or higher with a bit interval
of 100 nm or smaller."However, the higher coercive force of the medium is limited
by writing capability of the magnetic head.A recording system using a magnetic head having a magnetic
core composed of sendust or Co based amorphous has been
conventionally employed, while it has not been conceived to raise
the
