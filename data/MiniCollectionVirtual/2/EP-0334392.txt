<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to an optical scanning unit for controlling and directing a beam on recording tracks of a surface to be scanned of an information carrier, the scanning unit having an objective which has an optical axis and is provided with an objective lens (601) for focusing the beam to a scanning spot on the said surface, the scanning unit also having an electromagnetic drive mechanism for constantly correcting the position of the objective with respect to the information carrier, the drive mechanism being provided with an objective mount (603) for the objective, this objective mount having a movable annular body which is arranged coaxially with respect to the optical axis, is provided with magnet poles at the ends and comprises permanently magnetic parts (603a; 603b) fitted axially one on the other, and the drive mechanism being provided furthermore with fixed coils (613; 615; 619) which magnetically interact with the said magnet body via an air gap and which have at least three sets of segment coils each having two segment coils, these sets being arranged next to one another at the same distances apart, seen in the circumferential direction of the magnet body, each individual segment coil having two active coil parts lying axially apart and extending around the magnet body at the same distance from it, one of these coil parts being located in the vicinity of one axial end of the magnet body in the central position and the other being offset axially in the direction of the magnet body centre, the two said coil parts being connected by axially running coil parts.

An optical scanning unit for controlling and directing of a radiation beam 
on recording trace of a surface to be scanned of an information carrier, the scanning 

unit comprising an objective having an optical axis, which objective comprises an 
objective lens for focusing the radiation beam so as to form a scanning spot on said 

surface, the scanning unit further comprising an electromagnetic actuating device for 
continuously correcting the position of the objective relative to the information carrier, 

which actuating device comprises an objective holder for the objective, which objective 
holder has a movable ring-shaped body (603) arranged to be coaxial with the optical 

axis, which body has oppositely magnetised magnetic poles at its axial ends and 
comprises axially superposed permanent-magnetic parts, the actuating device further 

comprising stationary coils which cooperate magnetically with said magnetic body 
via
 
an air gap and comprise at least three segmental coils sets of two segmental coils (for 

example 613.1, 615.1) each, which sets are arranged adjacent one another at equal 
distances viewed in the circumferential direction of the magnetic body, 
characterised in 
that
 each individual coil (for example 613.1) comprises two axially spaced-apart active 
coil sections (613a, 613b) extending around the magnetic body at equal distances, one 

of said coil sections being disposed in the proximity of an axial end of the magnetic 
body which is in its central position and the other coil section being axially offset 

towards the centre of the magnetic body, which two coil sections are interconnected by 
axially extending coil elements (613c, 613d). 
An optical scanning unit as claimed in Claim 1, 
characterised in that
 an 
annular coil (619) extends around the centre of the magnetic body in a radial plane, 

which coil is interposed between the said segmental coils of the coil sets. 
An optical scanning unit as claimed in Claim 2, 
characterised in that
 all 
the segmental coils of the segmental coil sets and the annular coil comprise flat 

conductors arranged on a cylindrical support surrounding the magnetic body. 
An optical scanning unit as claimed in Claim 1, 2 or 3, 
characterised in 
that
 an intermediate part (903c), which is non-magnetic, soft-magnetic or also  
 

permanent-magnetic, is interposed between the permanent-magnetic parts of the 
magnetic body (903a, 903b). 
An optical scanning unit as claimed in Claim 4, 
characterised in that
 the 
north poles of the parts of the magnetic body are oriented towards the intermediate part 

and the north poles of the intermediate part are oriented towards its outer wall. 
An optical scanning unit as in Claim 4, 
characterised in that
 the north 
poles of the parts of the magnetic body are oriented towards the axial ends and the 

north poles of the intermediate part are oriented towards its inner wall.
