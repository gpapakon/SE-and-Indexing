<ABSTRACT>
Bucket dredger, comprising: a swivelling ladder connected to 
a vessel, a driven upper wheel at the top end and a polygonal 

lower wheel (7) at the lower end of the ladder, one or 
more endless chains (6) which are guided along both wheels, 

and buckets (9) connected to the shackles (8) of these 
chains (6). For receiving the lateral force exerted on a 

bucket the bottom wall (12) of each bucket (9) is provided 
with two ribs (15) extending downwardly, which extend substantially 

parallel to the side walls (14) of the bucket and 
which, in the assembled state of the bucket, extend adjacent 

the chains (6) and between the chains and upright edges (16) 
placed on the lower wheel (7). The ribs (15) can extend 

along the length of two shackles (8).

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a bucket dredger, comprising:
a swivelling ladder connected to a vessel, a driven upper
wheel at the top end and a regular or irregular polygonal
lower wheel at the lower end of the ladder, one or more
endless chains which are guided along both wheels, and buckets
connected to the shackles of these chains.Such bucket dredgers are known from DE-B-29 09 272. While in the
bucket dredgers of old the buckets are connected to each
other either directly hingingly or through an intermediate
shackle, the use of endless chains, to which the buckets are
fixed to the shackles thereof, has the advantage that assembly
of the whole is simpler and that a bucket can be replaced
easily.Although, naturally, the chains on the wheels are also
guided in a lateral direction, this guiding is generally not
sufficient for bearing the loads exerted laterally on the
buckets without any problems. Because the chains will never
be able to be stretched compeletely taut, a chain will be
able to be lifted off the lower wheel when a lateral force
is exerted on the bucket, and it shall not experience sufficient
support from its lateral guide any more. This holds
true especially when large volume buckets are to be used.The bucket dredgers embodied in this fashion are therefore
in principle used as elevator dredgers; i.e. that the
dredging machine is displaced only in the direction of the
ladder and not sideways.The invention has the objective of making known dredging
machines more universally applicable, and to that end
it provides in that the bottom wall of each bucket is provided
with two ribs extending downwardly, which extend substantially
parallel to the side walls of the bucket and
which, in the assembled state of the bucket, extend adjacent
the chains to cooperate with upright edges placed on
the lower wheel, so that a lateral force exerted on a bucket
will be received by one of said upright edges.In this way it is achieved that with lateral swivelling
of the bucket dredger, conventionally as with bucket dredgers, 
the lateral force exerted on a bucket is passed directly
to the lower wheel through the rib connected to the
bucket.Although it is possible in principle to place the ribs
on a bucket such that they will be located on the outside of
the upright edges of the lower wheel, it is preferable to
provide in that each rib is located between a chain and an
upright edge of the lower wheel, the upright edges being
located on the outside of each of the ribs.Then the ribs can be more or less directly connected

<CLAIMS>
Bucket dredger comprising: a swivelling ladder (3) connected
to a vessel (1), a driven upper wheel (5) at the top

end and a regular or irregular polygonal lower wheel (7) at
the lower end of the ladder, one or more endless chains (6)

which are guided along both wheels (5,7), and buckets (9)
bound to the shackles (8) of these chains (6), 
characterized
in that
 the bottom wall (12) of each bucket (9) is provided
with two ribs (15) extending downwardly, which extend substantially

parallel to the side walls (14) of the bucket and
which, in the assembled state of the bucket, extend adjacent

the chains (6) to cooperate with upright edges (16) placed on
the lower wheel, so that a lateral force exerted on a bucket

(9) will be received by one of said upright edges (16). 
Bucket dredger according to Claim 1, 
characterised in
that
 each rib (15) is located between a chain (6) and an
upright edge (16) of the lower wheel (7), the upright edges

being located on the outside of each of the ribs.
Bucket dredger according to Claim 1 or 2, 
characterised
in that
 the distance between the supports (11), placed on
the bucket (9) for connecting it to the chains (6), is

adapted to the length of the shackle (8) of the largest
chain (6) normally commercially available, while the ribs

(15) placed on the bucket (9) extend to outwardly of the
supports (11) and along substantially the whole length of

the bottom wall (12) of the bucket (9), so that they can
extend along a shackle (8) following the shackle which is

connected to the bucket, the lower wheel (7) being embodied
such that at least two shackles (8) of the chain (6) come to

lie in line with each other.
