<ABSTRACT>
A fastening member for fastening a net to a tubular post has, on the one hand, a holder portion (2) for fixedly retaining the net and, on the other hand, an anchorage portion (1) for fixedly retaining the fastening member in the post. The anchorage portion (1) extends in through a hole in the wall of the post and is provided with barbs (7, 9) which snap in place in the fastening member. The anchorage portion (1) has a longitudinal passage (4) in communication with an accommodation space (3) in the holder portion (2). The passage (4) has a funnel-shaped flared mouth portion (5) to facilitate insertion of a wire included in the net in the accommodation space (3). On insertion of the wire, the passage (4) is flared in that the wall (12, 13) of the holder portion (2) facing away from the passage (4) is resiliently bendable.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a fastening member for fastening
an object such as a net, a steel wire, cable or the like to a
carrier such as a post, a wall or the like, comprising a holder
portion for fixedly retaining the object; one anchorage portion
for anchoring the fastening member in an opening in the carrier,
said anchorage portion having barb means located for securing the
fastening member to the carrier by snapping into engagement with
the carrier on insertion of the anchorage portion into the opening,
said anchorage portion further having a longitudinally
extending passage opening into an accomodation space provided in
the holder portion, said passage having a flared mouth portion at
its end distant from the accomodation space.On erecting fences along traffic arteries to prevent game from
getting on to the traffic artery, two methods are employed today
for securing the fence. As one alternative, use is made of sheet
metal lugs which extend about wires or cables included in the
fence and which, via blind rivets, are secured in holes in those
posts which support the fence. As another alternative, solutions
are also proposed in the art in which the post supporting the
fence is provided with welded projecting hooks on which the fence
is suspended, whereafter the hooks are bent so as to form a
closed ring which fixedly retains the fence.These prior art designs and constructions may function satisfactorily
of themselves, but are expensive to manufacture and
use.In EP-A-062 690 there is disclosed a plastic fastening member. This
fastening member has two parallel legs to be introduced into an
opening of a carrier, e g a tube. The legs are separated by a 
slot but also an axially extending passage for receiving a locking
pin. When the legs have been inserted into the carrier the
locking pin is driven into the passage so that the legs are
heavily bent and expanded from one another. Due to the considerable
stresses incured during the bending there is a great risk
that the legs, as time passes by, fracture and the fastening
member comes loose.DE 37 06 149 A1 discloses a stainless spring steel fastening
member with two spring legs connected via
narrow neck portions to a ring shaped portion for receiving a
wire or the like, according to the preamble of claim 1.Fastening members of the type mentioned by way of introduction are also
known within other technical fields, for example for fixedly securing different
small fittings in the automotive industry or the like However, these
constructions cannot be

<CLAIMS>
A fastening device for fastening an object, such as a
net, a steel wire, cable or the like, to a carrier comprising

a holder portion (2) for fixedly retaining the object; one
anchorage portion (1) comprised of two shanks for anchoring the fastening member in

an opening in the carrier, said shanks having barb
means (7, 8) located for securing the fastening member to the

carrier by snapping into engagement with the carrier on
insertion of the anchorage portion into the opening, said

anchorage portion further having a longitudinally extending
passage (4) between the shanks and opening into an accomodation space (3) provided

in the holder portion (2), said passage having a flared mouth
portion (5) at its end distant from the accomodation space, the anchorage portion

(1) being substantially rigid while the holder portion (2) is
resiliently yieldable to allowing deformation

when introducing the object into the accomodation space (3)
and when introducing the anchorage portion (1) into the opening

of the carrier

characterized
 in that the wall (12) of the
holder portion (2) facing away from the anchorage portion (1)

has an opening aligned with the passage (4), and a
locking pin for insertion into the passage to positively hold the shanks apart is provided.
A fastening member as claimed in claim 1, 
characterized

in that, the walls defining the passage (4)
have longitudinally extending grooves or notches on the

surfaces facing one another.
A fastening member as claimed in claim 1 or 2,

characterized
 in that, the passage (4) has a
bell shaped end portion (5).
A fastening member as claimed in either of claims 1-3,

characterized
 in that, the upper and lower
surfaces defining the passage (4) have mutually facing

projections (17, 18) at their portions located most proximal
to the accomodation space (3). 
A fastening member as claimed in either of claims 1-4,

characterized
 in that, it is provided, for
abutment against the front or outer side of the carrier, or

its rear or inner side, respectively, with planar surfaces
(9, 10).
A fastening member as claimed in either of claims 1-4,

characterized
 in that, it is provided, for
abutment against the front or outer side of the carrier, or

its rear or inner side, respectively, with substantially
cylindrical surfaces (15, 16).
