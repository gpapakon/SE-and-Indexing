<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to catalysts containing a
refractory oxide carrier and as catalytically active metals a metal
of Group VI-B and a metal of Group VIII, to a
process comprising contacting a hydrocarbon feedstock containing
aromatic compounds in the presence of hydrogen and at elevated
temperature and pressure with such catalysts, and to a process for
preparing such catalyst.In US patent specification 3,491,019 a catalyst has been
described for use in selective hydrogenation of aromatic
hydrocarbons which have more unsaturation than present in a single
benzene nucleus. The catalyst comprises a metal of Group VI-B,
preferably tungsten, and a metal of Group VIII, preferably nickel,
deposited on a silica-alumina composite comprising from about 35
weight percent to about 65 weight percent silica.In US patent specification 3,422,002 a platinum series metal-molybdena-alumina
catalyst is described which has good hydrogenation and hydrodenitrogenation activity.The present invention relates to catalysts which show improved
hydrogenation activity when used in a process in which hydrocarbons
containing aromatic compounds are contacted with the catalyst in the
presence of hydrogen and at elevated temperature and pressure, more
specifically when used in hydrotreating of hydrocarbon fractions
containing aromatic compounds and compounds containing sulphur
and/or nitrogen. At the moment, such hydrocarbon fractions are
usually subjected to a two-stage process in order to reduce the
amount of aromatic compounds. In such two-stage process the
hydrocarbon fraction is subjected to a first stage in which mainly
the amount of sulphur and/or nitrogen containing compounds present
in the fraction is brought down, and subsequently to a second stage
in which mainly the amount of aromatic compounds is reduced. Such
two-stage process is necessary as conventional hydrogenation
catalysts for reducing the aromatics content show poor hydrogenation
activity in the presence of substantial amounts of sulphur and/or 
nitrogen containing compounds. The catalysts according to the
present invention have a very good hydrogenation activity, even in
the presence of relatively large amounts of sulphur and/or nitrogen
containing compounds. Further, these catalysts have a good
desulphurization and/or denitrogenation activity. This makes that
the amount of both aromatic compounds and sulphur and/or nitrogen
containing compounds, can be reduced in a single stage process.The process of the present invention is especially advantageous
for
