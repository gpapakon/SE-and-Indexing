<ABSTRACT>
In accordance with a tire air-pressure reduction 
detecting apparatus of the present invention, if it is judged 

that tires all have a normal air pressure, it is judged 
whether or not a count value (C) is not less than a steady-state 

count (L
2
), and then if the count value (C) is not less 
than the steady-state count (L
2
), a counter (CNT) is 
decremented. That is, the count value (C) is kept to the 

steady-state count (L
2
) at the lowest, from which 
incrementation is started. On the other hand, if it is judged 

that a tire air pressure is reduced, it is judged whether or 
not the count value (C) is less than an upper counting limit 

(L
1
), and then if the count value (C) is less than the upper 

counting limit (L
1
), the counter (CNT) is incremented. That 
is, the count value (C) is kept to the upper counting limit 

(L
1
) at the highest, from which decrementation is started. 
Then, if the count value (C) is not less than a warning 

threshold count (N
1
), a warning is issued, and if the count 
value (C) is less than a warning stopping threshold count 

(N
2
), the warning is stopped. Thus, the frequency of the 
issuance of erroneous warnings can be reduced.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to apparatuses for detecting
and warning against a reduction in the air pressure of a tire
on a four-wheeled vehicle.In recent years, there have been invented tire air-pressure
reduction detecting apparatuses as a safety device
for four-wheeled vehicles such as automobiles, trucks and the
like, some of which have already been put into practical use.The tire air-pressure reduction detecting apparatuses have
been developed in recognition of the importance thereof for
the following reason. If the air pressure of a tire is
reduced, the tire has an increased flexure and the
temperature thereof rises, thereby reducing the strength of
polymer material of the tire. This will result in the burst
of the tire. However, a driver is hardly aware of the
reduction in the tire air pressure.A tire air-pressure reduction detecting process for use
in the tire air-pressure reduction detecting apparatuses is, for
example, based on a difference among the rotational angular
velocities F1, F2, F3 and F4 (which are generally referred to
as "rotational angular velocity Fi") of four tires W1, W2, W3
and W4 (which correspond to a front left wheel, front right 
wheel, rear left wheel and rear right wheel, respectively, and
are generally referred to as "tire Wi") attached to a vehicle.In accordance with this tire air-pressure reduction
detecting process, the rotational angular velocities Fi of the
tires Wi are detected on a predetermined sampling cycle ΔT,
for example, based on signals output from wheel velocity
sensors mounted on the tires Wi. If the dynamic load radii of
the respective tires Wi (radii as calculated by dividing by
2π a traveling distance of the vehicle for each turn of the
respective tires) are all the same, the rotational angular
velocities Fi of the respective tires Wi are also all the same
when the vehicle is traveling straight.The dynamic load radius of the tire Wi is changed, for
example, by a change in the air pressure of the tire Wi. That
is, if the air pressure of the tire Wi is reduced, the dynamic
load radius of the tire Wi becomes smaller than that observed
when the tire air pressure is normal. Accordingly, the
rotational angular velocity Fi of the tire Wi becomes higher
than that observed when the tire air pressure is normal.
Therefore, the reduction in the air pressure of the tire Wi
can be detected based on a difference in the rotational
angular velocity Fi. A determinant equation for detecting a
reduction in the air pressure of the tire Wi is shown below
(which is
