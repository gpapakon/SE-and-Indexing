<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to moisture-curable ethylene copolymer 
compositions useful as hot-melt adhesives, and more particularly it relates to such 
compositions containing hydrolysable silane groups. The moisture-curable 
copolymers are prepared from defined ethylene copolymers containing a specified 
level of carboxylic functionality, by reaction with epoxy-silanes. Use of adhesives applied as a hot melt is growing rapidly because hot 
melts allow fast production speeds, and solvents are unnecessary. Use of solvents is 
increasingly regarded as undesirable. However, for many applications limited 
temperature resistance of hot-melt adhesives is a major deficiency. Often, a 'soft' 
adhesive which maintains an adhesive bond well at ambient temperatures becomes 
weak at higher temperatures, and is not suitable for use at such temperatures. Ethylene copolymers are well known for use as inexpensive hot-melt 
adhesives. Comonomers such as vinyl acetate or alkyl acrylates improve adhesive 
qualities over polyethylene alone partly because of their polar nature. Alkyl 
acrylates however are known to provide more stable ethylene copolymers than vinyl 
acetate. The higher n-alkyl acrylates, which produce low glass transition 
temperature, also produce lower glass transition temperature ethylene copolymers. 
This contributes to 'softness' of the adhesive, imparting greater adhesivity, 
particularly at lower temperatures. Highly polar acidic monomers such as acrylic 
and methacrylic acid are also known to be excellent comonomers for ethylene 
copolymer adhesives. Reduction in crystallinity resulting from copolymerization also 
imparts adhesivity. In ethylene copolymers, both lower crystallinity and lower glass 
transition temperature result in 'softer' more adhesive polymers at ambient and low 
temperatures. However there will also be a tendency to creep more. Such ethylene 
copolymers exemplify the statement above, that 'soft' adhesives become weak at 
high temperature, and are less effective adhesives at higher temperatures. Various means have been used to counter this tendency. One means 
is use of block copolymers or graft copolymers with a soft and a hard segment. The 
segments are blocks or grafts consisting of a moderate to long polymeric sequence.  
 
Another approach is to crosslink the adhesive after it has been applied as a hot 
melt, by such means as radiation or chemical post-reaction techniques. Such 
techniques have long been known to reduce creep and improve other properties, 
particularly in wire
