<ABSTRACT>
The composition comprises a 2-acetaminoalkane-1, 3-diol or its
optical isomer having the formula:



in which R1 signifies a linear alkyl group having 9 to 17 carbon atoms;

a 2-acylaminoalkane-1, 3-diol or its optical isomer having the formula:



in which R1 has the same meaning as mentioned above and R2 signifies
a linear acyl group having 14 to 24 carbon atoms;


as well as cholesterol, and optionally a compound chosen from the group
consisting of a cholesterol derivative, a fatty acid and a derivative

thereof. This composition forms a lamellar liquid crystal phase which
can retain moisture. When the composition is applied to a human skin or

scalp, it prevents the skin and scalp from drying-out or deterioration.
The composition can thus be used as a cosmetic or pharmaceutical

product.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a novel composition containing a
liquid crystal phase, in particular a liquid composition comprising a
mixture of compounds belonging to the ceramide family and a medium
suited for cosmetic or pharmaceutical use.The lipid composition according to the invention may comprise a
racemic 2-acetamidoalkane-1,3-diol, i.e. N-acetylsphinganine, or an
optically active form thereof; a racemic 2-acylaminoalkane-1,3-diol or
an optically active form thereof; and cholesterol, and optionally a
cholesterol ester, e.g. cholesteryl hydroxystearate; iso-stearic acid; and /or
other higher fatty acids.The composition may further comprise a triglyceride, a
phospholipid or other cosmetically or pharmaceutically acceptable
vehicles or excipients. Such a composition may especially be appropriate
for use as a cosmetic product, an externally applicable skin preserver, a
bath additive, a hair-care product, or the like.The composition described above is capable of retaining moisture
on the subject to which it is applied. When it is applied on the skin, it
renders skin humid and fair, and reactivates skin cells. The composition
thus protects skin and provides a suitable cosmetic, dermatological or
bath-additive product. When applied to scalp or hair portion, subsequent
hair-washing does not cause a loss of water-soluble proteins or amino
acids from hair, so that the hair is protected from drying-out.To render the skin moist and smooth, the water content retained in
stratum corneum (horny layer) of the skin plays an important role. Water
seems to be retained in this stratum corneum by free amino acids,
organic acids, urea, inorganic ions or the like, contained therein. Such 
substances are actually used alone or in combination for preparing a
dermatological cosmetic product or medicine for external application, in
order to prevent or cure a rough skin.It has been found only recently that intercellular lipids contained
in the stratum corneum have a high water-retaining capacity and usually
contain about 30 % of water. These lipids control the evaporation of
corporal water and prevent external stimulants from penetrating, thereby
preserving a tender and smooth skin.Amongst the intercellular lipid components, a ceramide in
particular. but also a cholesterol ester, are known to improve rough skin,
when applied thereto. Especially, the ceramide serves as an efficient
barrier to a water migration.The intercellular lipids consist mainly of ceramides, cholesteryl
sodium sulphate, palmitic acid and cholesterol.
