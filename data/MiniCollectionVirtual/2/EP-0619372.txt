<ABSTRACT>
Human TNF muteins having higher binding affinity for human 
p75-TNF receptor than for human p55-TNF receptor include muteins 

having at least one deffect amino acid relative to wild-type human 
TNF at a position corresponding to position 33, 65, 67, 75, 87, 143, 

145 or 147 of the wild-type amino acid sequence. 
Such muteins can be used to characterise human p75-receptor 
and, together with known muteins with selective binding affinity for 

human p55-TNF receptor, can aid in distinguishing between TNF 
functions mediated via binding to human p75-receptor and those 

mediated via binding to human p55-receptor.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to Tumor Necrosis Factor Muteins. Tumor Necrosis Factor, or more specifically Tumor Necrosis 
Factor-alpha (for ease of reference, unless otherwise indicated, 
"Tumor Necrosis Factor" or "TNF" when used herein refers to TNF-α), 
is a cytokine, primarily produced by stimulated macrophages. It 
exhibits not only a striking cytotoxicity against various tumour cells 
[Carswell et al., Procd. Nat. Acad. Sci., USA 72, 3666-3670, (1975)] but 
also plays a multiple role as a mediator of inflammation and the 
immune response [for an overview see Beutler and Cerami, Ann. Rev. 
Immunol. 7, 625-655 (1989); Bonavista and Granger (eds.) "Tumor 
Necrosis Factor: Structure, Mechanism of Action, Role in Disease and 
Therapy, Karger, Basel (1990)]. The primary structure of human 
Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha (hTNF-α) has been deduced from the 
nucleotide sequence of a cDNA which has been cloned and expressed 
in E. coli [Pennica et al., Nature 312, 724-729 (1984); Marmenout et 
al., Europ. J. Biochem. 152, 515-522 (1985); Wang et al., Science 228, 
149-154 (1985); Shirai et al., Nature 313, 803-806 (1985)]. A striking 
homology in amino acid sequence (30%) was found between hTNF-α 
and human Lymphotoxin, often referred to as human Tumor Necrosis 
Factor-beta (hTNF-β), a cytokine mainly produced by activated 
lymphocytes [Gray et al., Nature 312, 721-724 (1984); Fiers et al., 
Cold Spring Harbour Symp. 51, 587-595 (1986)]. hTNF-α with modified amino acid sequences, so called TNF-α-muteins, 
have also been described in various publications - for 
example Yamagishi et al., Protein Engineering 3, 713-719, (1990); 
Fiers in "Tumor Necrosis Factors: Structure, Function and Mechanism  
 
of Action"; Fiers et al. in Bonavista and Granger, pp. 77-81 (see 
above); Goh et al., (1991) entitled "Structural and functional domains 
in human tumor necrosis factors." Prot. Engineering 4: 385-389; 
Kircheis et al., (1992) entitled "Biological activity of mutants of human 
tumor necrosis factor-alpha," Immunology 76: 433-438; Van Ostade 
et al., (1991) entitled "Localization of the active site of human tumor 
necrosis factor (hTNF) by mutational analyses," EMBO J. 10: 827-836;

activity on the p55 receptor," Nature 361: 266-269; Zhang et al.,

necrosis factor-α receptor binding site and structure-functional
