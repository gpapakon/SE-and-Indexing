<ABSTRACT>
The elastically deformable acetabular cup prosthesis comprises, on the one hand, a hollow hemispherical cap (2) which includes means for its external face (2h) to be elastically deformed whilst its internal wall remains rigid and undeformable and, on the other hand, an insert (3) made of plastic, for example polyethylene, which is provided with a collar (3d) having notches (3e) which interact, when it is fitted, with studs (2d, 2e and 2f) on the cap (2).

<CLAIMS>
Acetabular cup prosthesis, comprising a cup or
hollow hemispherical cap made of metal, composite or

similar, an insert made of plastic material such as
polyethylene, the hollow hemispherical cap including

means of deformation so that the outer face of the hollow
hemispherical cap deforms elastically while its inner

part remains rigid and non-deformable, characterized in
that the means of deformation consist of first slots (2
g
)
and second slots (2
i
) which are made in the thickness of
the cap (2) in such a way that each of the said first and

second slots opens out on the outer face (2
h
) and on the
edge (2
c
) thereof, while two of the said second slots
(2
i
) continue perpendicularly at one of their free ends
in the form of a groove (2
j
) extending towards the
outside of the cap in order to define two flexible wings

(2
k
).
Prosthesis according to Claim 1, characterized in
that the slots (2
g
, 2
i
) open out on the outer face (2
h
)
below a first row of open holes (2
a
) permitting the
passage of screws for fixing the cap (2) in the human

cavity.
Prosthesis according to Claim 1, characterized in
that the edge (2
c
) of the cap (2) includes three studs
(2
d
, 2
e
 and 2
f
) which are uniformly distributed around
half the circumference of the said cap (2) in such a way

that the first stud (2
d
) and the second stud (2
f
) are
aligned along one of the axes of symmetry of the said

cap, while the third stud (2
e
) is held by the other axis 
of symmetry.
Prosthesis according to Claim 3, characterized in
that the first slots (2
g
) are located, on the one hand,
between the first stud (2
d
) and the third stud (2
e
) and,
on the other hand, between the third stud (2
e
) and the
second stud (2
f
), while the second slots (2
i
) are
provided between the second stud (2
f
) and the first stud
(2
d
).
Prosthesis according to Claim 1, characterized in
that the outer face (2
h
) includes a zone (2
m
) for the
build-up of bone callus, which zone is located between

the edge (2
c
) and the first row of open holes (2
a
).
Prosthesis according to Claim 5, characterized in
that the zone (2
m
) includes a number of holes (2
n
) which
open out in the slots (2
g
 and 2
i
), and a number of blind
holes (2
p
).
Prosthesis according to Claim 1, characterized in
that the plastic insert (3) includes a cavity (3
a
)
centred on the axis of symmetry (X) of the prosthesis

(1), and an inner bevel (3
b
) which is inclined by an
angle α in relation to the axis (X) in order to

constitute a cylinder portion (3
c
) which prevents
luxation of the human or artificial hip ball.
Prosthesis according to Claim 7, characterized in
that the insert (3) includes a flange (3
d
) which is cut
with notches (3
e
) and whose thickness varies so as to
change the plane of its inclined outer face (3
f
) by
rotating the said insert inside the cap (2).
Prosthesis according to Claim 8, characterized in
that the notches (3
e
) of the flange (3
d
) cooperate with
the studs (2
d
, 2
e
 and 2
f
) of the cap (2) with a view to
making it possible to snap the insert (3) inside the cap.
Prosthesis according to Claim 8, characterized in
that the angle α of inclination of the inner bevel (3
b
)
is equal to 15° in relation to the axis (X) of the

prosthesis (1).
