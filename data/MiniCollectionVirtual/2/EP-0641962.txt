<ABSTRACT>
A diverter valve cartridge (34) adapted to be received 
in a cavity (50) in a solid body is provided said cartridge 

comprising a tubular elongated housing (60) adapted to be 
received in said cavity (50) to define a first compartment 

(B) between the inner end of said housing and the inner end 
of said cavity and defining a second compartment (A) within 

the housing (60), an inlet port at one side of the housing, 
and a first outlet port at the outer end of said housing; a 

shaft (64) mounted in said housing in coaxial relationship 
therewith for rectilinear movement along the longitudinal 

axis of said housing; a piston member (70) mounted on one 
end of said shaft (64) in sliding sealed relationship with 

the inner wall of said housing and serving to separate the 
first and second compartments; a valve member (66) mounted 

on the other end of said shaft (64) in position to open and 
close said first outlet port in response to rectilinear 

movement of said shaft (64); said housing defining a second 
outlet port (56) communicating with the interior of said 

first compartment (B); and means (60c) defining a passage 
from said second compartment (A) to said second outlet port 

(56), to provide for restricted water flow from said second

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a diverter valve
cartridge for use in conjunction with faucet assemblies such
as the type using the single operator mixing valve as
described, for example, in co-pending U S Application Serial
No (4686-25) (US-A-5 402 827).The diverter valve of the present invention is of the
same general type described, for example, in U S Patents
4,798,211; 4,609,006; and RE32,981.In kitchen faucets, it is common for water to pass
selectively through a spout or a handspray. As described in
Patent 4,798,221, diverter valves are commonly used in such
faucet assemblies to divert water to either the spout or the
handspray. The diverter valve automatically shuts off the
water flow through the faucet spout when the spray is turned
on. On the other hand, when the spray is turned off, the
diverter valve automatically permits water to flow to the
spout.As pointed out in U S Patent 4,798,221, cartridge-type
diverter valves are known in the prior art. For example,
U S Patent 4,577,653 disclosures a cartridge valve mechanism
with biasing prongs to bias the valve element to one
position.An objective of the present invention is to provide an
improved miniature diverter valve cartridge which is received in a cavity of a solid body and which operates
to shut off completely the flow of water from the spout of
the faucet when the spray is turned on, and to hold the
water flow to the spout completely off during operation of
the handspray to avoid annoying drips or trickles of water
stream from the spout when the spray is in operation. Another objective of the invention is to provide such
an improved diverter valve cartridge in which the foregoing
objective is achieved in an expeditious manner and by means
of an extremely simple mechanism.Yet another objective of the invention is to provide
such an improved diverter valve cartridge which is
constructed to minimise clogging of the assembly due to
contaminants.An assembly of a solid body and a diverter valve cartridge according to the
pre-characterising portion of claim 1 is known from
FR-A-2 444 872.The invention is defined in claim 1. The dependent claims define preferred embodiments of the invention.The invention invention will now be described, by way of example
only, in the accompanying Figures in which:
Figure 1 is a side elevational view, partly in section
of a single operator water mixing faucet assembly, including
a valve cartridge of the type described and claimed in the
co-pending application referred to above, also showing the

<CLAIMS>
An assembly of a solid body and a diverter valve
cartridge (34) received in a cavity (50) in

the solid body, in which said cartridge comprises

a tubular elongated housing (60) received
in said cavity (50) to define a first compartment (B)

between an inner end of said housing and an inner end of
said cavity and defining a second compartment (A) within the

housing (60), an inlet port at one side of the housing, and
a first outlet port at one side of the housing;
a shaft (64) mounted in said housing in coaxial
relationship therewith for rectilinear movement along the

longitudinal axis of said housing;
a piston member (70) mounted on one end of said shaft
(64) in sliding sealed relationship with the inner wall of

said housing and serving to separate the first and second
compartments;
a valve member (66) mounted on the other end of said
shaft (64) in position to open and close said first outlet

port in response to rectilinear movement of said shaft (64);
said solid body defining a second outlet port (56) communicating

with the interior of said first compartment (B); and
means (60c) defining a passage from said second
compartment (A) to said second outlet port (56) to provide

for restricted water flow from said second compartment (A)
to said first compartment (B) and to said second outlet port

(56),

   characterised in that said housing (60) defines an
integral annular rim (60a), said rim (60a) having a notch

(60c) therein to form said last-named means for providing
restricted water flow from said second compartment (A) to

said first compartment (B) and to establish a predetermined
pressure differential therebetween when said second outlet

port (56) is opened. 
An assembly according to Claim 1, characterised in that
said solid body is a casing (10) included in a water faucet

assembly and in which pressurised outlet water from said
faucet assembly flows to said inlet port.
An assembly according to claim 2, characterised in that
said first outlet port is coupled to a spout (30) included

in said faucet assembly.
An assembly according to Claim 2, characterised in that
said second outlet port (56) is coupled to a spray unit

(40), and in that water pressure is established in said
first compartment (B) and when said spray unit (40) is

turned off which acts to bias said piston member (70) and
said shaft (64) in a direction to cause said valve member

(66) to open said first outlet port, and in that water
pressure is developed in said first compartment (B) which is

less than the water pressure in said second compartment (A)
when said spray unit (40) is operated which acts to bias

said piston member (70) and said shaft (64) in a direction
to cause said valve member (66) to close said first outlet

port.
5 An assembly according to Claim 1, characterised in that
said integral annular rim (60a) has a peripheral bead (60b)

which engages the inner wall of said cavity in sealing
relationship therewith.
An assembly according to Claim 2, characterised in that
it further includes a check valve (36) mounted adjacent to

said inlet port to prevent backflow of water into said
faucet assembly in the event of failure of water pressure

therein. 
An assembly according to Claim 1, characterised in that
pressurised water is introduced into said inlet port, and in

that water pressure is established in said first compartment
(B) and when said second outlet port (56) is closed which

acts to bias said piston member (70) and said shaft (64) in
a direction to cause said valve member (66) to open said

first outlet port, and in that water pressure is developed
in said first compartment (B) which is lower than the water

pressure in said second compartment (A) when said second
outlet (56) is open which acts to bias said piston member

member (66) to close said first outlet port.
An assembly according to Claim 1 characterised in that
said shaft (64) is formed of metal having two integral

annular members at each end, and in that said piston member
(70) is formed of plastic having an annular resilient wiper

member (72) mounted thereon, and in which said valve member
(66) is formed of a resilient material, and which includes a

plastic retainer (68) for said valve member (66), said
piston (70) being mounted on said shaft (64) at one end

annular members at said other end.
