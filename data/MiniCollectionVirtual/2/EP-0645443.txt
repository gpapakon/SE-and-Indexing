<ABSTRACT>
A lubricant composition comprising as a base 
oil one or more ester oils, alkylbenzene oils and 

mineral oils, and a glycidyl ether compound having at 
least two epoxy groups is miscible in hydrofluorocarbon 

and hydrochlorofluorocarbon refrigerants such as R134a, 
etc. as replacing refrigerants of R12 and provides a 

stable operation of refrigeration compressor for a 
long period of time without causing corrosion and wear 

of a sliding portion of the compressor.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to refrigerant compressors and refrigeration apparatus comprising a lubricant composition 
miscible in hydrofluorocarbon and hydrochlorofluorocarbon 
refrigerants and a process for using such a 
lubricant composition in refrigerator compressors and 
refrigerator compressor built-in refrigeration apparatus. 
More particularly, the present invention relates to refrigerant compressors and refrigeration apparatus comprising a 
lubricant composition which is less deteriorated when 
contacted with a refrigerant in refrigerators at 
relatively high temperatures and suitable for enhancing 
reliability of compressors and a process for using such 
a lubricant composition in refrigerator compressors 
and refrigeration apparatus containing refrigerator 
compressors therein. Recently, the use of chlorofluorocarbons (CFC) 
is to be inhibited in order to prevent the ozone layer 
in the stratosphere from breakage. Such CFC's include 
R11 (trichloromonofluoromethane), R12 (dichlorodifluoromethane), 
R113, R114, R115, etc. For example, 
R12 which has been used in refrigeration cycle in 
refrigeration apparatus such as a refrigerator is an 
object to be inhibited. As replacing refrigerants, 
hydrochlorofluorocarbons (HCFC) containing one or more 
hydrogen atoms in the molecule such as R22, and R502 
(azeotropic mixed refrigerants containing 48.8% by  
 
weight of R22 and 51.2% by weight of R115) are studied. 
The ozone layer breakage coefficient of R22 is 0.05 and 
that of R502 is 0.3 taking the ozone layer breakage 
coefficient of R12 as 1. In the future, a hydrofluorocarbon 
(HFC) containing no chlorine atom in the 
molecule will be employed eternally. A typical example 
of HFC is R134a which has the ozone layer breakage 
coefficient of 0, is nonflammable and has almost the 
same thermodynamic properties as R12. Thus, R134a can 
be used practically without changing remarkably the 
structures of refrigeration apparatus such as refrigerators 
and dehumidifiers and refrigerator compressors. 
However, R134a (CH2FCF3) has very unique properties 
due to its special chemical structure, so that it 
is not miscible in refrigerating machine oils used in 
the refrigeration system of R12, e.g. mineral oils 
(naphthenic oils, paraffinic oils) and synthetic oils 
such as alkylbenzene. Thus, there arise various problems 
in that oil return becomes worse when the oil flows into 
the refrigeration system, resulting in retaining the 
oil in the heat exchanger to lower heat transfer 
ability, and in the worst case,
