<ABSTRACT>
Apparatus for wrapping loads in stretchable film 
comprising a pre-stretching unit (7) which is translated 

in a circular path around the periphery of a load (10) to 
be wrapped, whilst being reciprocated with respect to the 

height of said load (10). The said said unit (7) comprises 
a supply reel (18) for the stretchable film, a first pair 

of nipple rollers (21-22) positively driven at a first 
peripheral speed by a suitable motor, and a second pair of 

nipple rollers (35-36) driven at a second peripheral speed 
greater than the said first peripheral speed, by the said 

driving motor, through a suitable transmission. The film 
from said supply reel is passed through the said two pairs 

of nipple rollers (21,22-35,36) for being pre-stretched 
before being wound around the said load (10). The output 

from the said motor is transmitted through a reducer (37) 
directly to one pair of the said nipple rollers, and is 

transmitted to the other pair of nipple rollers from said 
reducer (37) through a suitable speed change gear (26).

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a process and an apparatus for 
wrapping loads in a pre-stretched film of subsequently 
shrinkable material, of the kind of the plastics "with a 
memory", which are elastic but require a certain time 
interval between stretching and contraction. From GB-A- 2083.002 it is known a process and apparatus 
for wrapping loads in stretch film comprising a roller 
assembly having two interconnected rollers rotatable by 
the web as it is drawn off a film supply upon being 
wrapped around a load on a turntable, according to which 
the said rollers are interconnected so that an upstream 
one of which rotates slower than the other to produce film 
elongation between the rollers, and in which the force on 
the film between the roller assembly and the load is 
relieved by the action of a positive constant torque 
device driving the rollers, so that the elongation between 
the roller assembly and the load is equal to or less than 
the elongation incurred between the rollers. According to the above prior art device, the load must be 
supported on a turntable, with the film feeding and pre-­
stretching device being fixed. This is a serious drawback, 
particularly whenever wrapping loads formed by a stacks of 
single articles, as for instance bricks or the  
 
like. Moreover, in order to wrap loads of different peripheral 
extension, with a film having a given pre-stretch, it is 
necessary to vary the speed at which the turntable is 
rotated, or to change the transmission ratio between the 
two film-stretching rollers, which later operation may not 
be performed easily and quickly with the said prior art 
device. Apparatuses are known, as for instance the apparatus 
described and shown in the Italian Utility Model 
Application 15283 B/83, according to which the load is 
supported on a fixed platform, and the film feeding and 
stretching device is carried by a rotatable arm, which is 
displaced all around the load to be wrapped. Although by 
this apparatus the problems depending from the rotation of 
the load are solved, nevertheless the other problems 
mentioned, viz easy and quick change of the load-wrapping 
speed and change of the pre-stretch amount of the film, 
are still unsolved. Moreover, with such a device it is difficult to overcome 
the problems arising at the very beginning of the wrapping 
operation, whenever the fast rotating pre-stretched film 
is engaged with the stationary load, which may result in 
tearing of the said film. From U.S.-A 3.589.091 it is known a method and

1) An apparatus for wrapping loads in stretchable film 
comprising a pre-stretching unit (7) which is translated 

in a circular path around the periphery of a load (10) to 
be wrapped, whilst being reciprocated with respect to the 

height of said load (10), said unit comprising a supply 
reel (18) for the stretchable film, a first pair of nipple 

rollers (21-22) positively driven at a first peripheral 
speed by a suitable motor, and a second pair of nipple 

rollers (35-36) driven at a second peripheral speed 
greater than the said first peripheral speed, by the said 

driving motor, through a suitable transmission, and in 
which the said film from said supply reel is passed 

through the said two pairs of nipple rollers (21,22-35,36) 
for being pre-stretched before being wound around the said 

load (10), characterized by the fact that the output from 
the said motor is transmitted through a reducer (37) to 

one pair of the said nipple rollers, and is transmitted to 
the other pair of nipple rollers from said reducer (37) 

through a suitable speed change gear (26). 
2) Apparatus according to claim 1, characterized by the 
fact that the said speed change gear (26) is disposed in 

the transmission line between the motor-reducer (37) and 
said first pair of nipple rollers (21,22). 
3) Apparatus according to claim 1, characterized by the 
fact that means (65-66) are provided which are responsive 

to the tension imposed to the pre-stretched web (118) 
being delivered to the load (10) to be wrapped, the said 

tension-responsive means (65,66) acting on control means 
(69, 69′, 69") electrically connected to a circuit

which is apt to control the rotational speed of the said 
nipple-rollers (21,22-35,36) driving motor (37). 
4) Apparatus according to claim 3, in which the said 
tension responsive means are in the form of dandy rollers 

(65,66), the said dandy rollers having associated 
therewith abutment means (67,68) cooperating with two or 

more sensors (69, 69′,69") electrically connected to the 
said motor speed-control circuit (79). 
5) Apparatus according to any one of the preceding claims, 
characterized by the fact that the said stretchable film 

supply reel (18) is positively driven at the same 
peripheral speed of the said first nipple-rollers pair (21, 

22), by frictional contact with one (21) of the said 
nipple rollers of said first nipple rollers pair. 
6) Apparatus according to claims 2 or 3, in which means 
(51,52,53,55,56) are provided for adjusting the tension
