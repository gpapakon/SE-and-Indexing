<ABSTRACT>
A system for evaluating a vehicle driving style of a motor vehicle is proposed, which system has sensors arranged in the motor vehicle for determining driving states of the motor vehicle and an evaluation unit which is isolated from the vehicle and has a computer which reads out driving state signals derived from the sensor signals and feeds them to a memory and/or a display unit. The sensors are connected to an encoder which converts the sensor signals into a serial data stream which is fed to a transmitter which is fixed to the vehicle. A receiver which is isolated from the vehicle receives the transmitting signals and feeds them to a decoder which reconstructs the sensor signals from the serial data stream and feeds them to the evaluation unit. Advantageously, at least one sensor detects striking features of the route and another sensor detects medically relevant data of the driver of the motor vehicle so that a complete online analysis of the journey is possible.
