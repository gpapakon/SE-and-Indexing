<ABSTRACT>
The surveillance system uses a cordless telephone with a base station coupled to the telephone network via a subscriber line (AL) and communicating with a number of mobile stations (MS1,MS2) via a free communication channel held in a memory (SP). The surveillance mode is selected via a switch (SM1) at one mobile station, with direct communication between the latter and a second mobile station via the identified free communication channels, so that the components not employed in the monitoring mode are disconnected, via a control device (ST1,ST2). When the surveillance mode is terminated via the mode selection switch in one of the mobile stations, the control devices in each mobile station are used to switch the disconnected components are switch back in.

Method of enabling an acoustic monitoring in the case of
the cordless telephone whose base station (BS) is connected

via a main exchange line (AL) to a communications network and
in the case of which a connection exists via transmission

channels to one or more of the mobile stations (MS1, MS2)
assigned to the base stations (BS), wherein the transmission

channels are checked for seizure by a search device (SU1,
SU2) disposed in the respective receiver (E1, E2), free

transmission channels are stored in a memory (SP, SPB) and
are used during a connection for the exchange of data

telegrams (D), 
characterized in that
 the monitoring mode is
initiated under user control by actuating switching means

(SM1) of a first mobile station (MS1) and a second mobile
station (MS2) is selected, 
in that
 a transmission channel is
automatically found that is detected as free by the search

device (SU1) of the first mobile station (MS1) and the search
device (SU2) of the second mobile station (MS2), via which

transmission channel transmission takes place directly
between the first mobile station (MS1) and the second mobile

station (MS2), 
in that
 assemblies not needed in the
participating mobile stations (MS1, MS2) in the monitoring

mode are disconnected by a control device (ST1, ST2), and 
in
that
 the monitoring mode is terminated by actuating switching
means (SM1) of the first mobile station (MS1) or of the

second mobile station (MS2) and assemblies disconnected in
the monitoring mode are switched on again by the control

device (ST1, ST2).
Method of enabling an acoustic monitoring in the case of
the cordless telephone whose base station (BS) is connected 

via a main exchange line (AL) to a communications network and
in the case of which a connection exists via transmission

channels to one or more of the mobile stations (MS1, MS2)
assigned to the base stations (BS) via transmission channels,

wherein the transmission channels are checked for seizure by
a search device (SU1, SU2) disposed in the respective

receiver (E1, E2), free transmission channels are stored in a
memory (SP, SPB) and are used during a connection for the

exchange of data telegrams (D), 
characterized in that
 the
monitoring mode is initiated by actuating switching means

(SM1) of a first mobile station (MS1) and a second mobile
station (MS2) is selected, 
in that
 a first transmission
channel is automatically found that is detected as free by

the search device (SU1) of the first mobile station (MS1) and
the search device (SUB) of the base station (BS) and also a

second transmission channel that is detected as free by the
search device (SU2) of the second mobile station (MS2) and

the search device (SUB) of the base station (SB), wherein the
receiver (EB) of the base station (BS) synchronizes to the

second transmission channel and the transmitter (SB) of the
base station (BS) synchronizes to the first transmission

channel, as a result of which the acoustic signals of the
second mobile station (MS2) are transmitted to the first

mobile station (MS1) via the base station (BS), 
in that

assemblies in the participating mobile stations (MS1, MS2)
not needed in the monitoring mode are disconnected by the

respective control device (ST1, ST2) and 
in that
 the
monitoring mode in the base station (BS) and the two mobile

stations (MS1, MS2) is terminated by actuating switching
means (SM1) of the first mobile station (MS1) or of the

second mobile station (MS2) and assemblies disconnected in 
the monitoring mode are switched on again by the control

device (ST1, ST2).
Method of enabling an acoustic monitoring in the case of
the cordless telephone whose base station (BS) is connected

via a main exchange line (AL) to a communications network and
in the case of which a connection exists via transmission

channels to one or more of the mobile stations (MS1, MS2)

in that
 the
assemblies (V2, L2) not needed in the transmission mode are

disconnected and
