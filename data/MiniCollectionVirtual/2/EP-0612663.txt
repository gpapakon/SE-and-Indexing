<CLAIMS>
Folding box made from cardboard or any similar
semi-rigid material, wherein the box body has folding

lines (ab, a'b') on two opposite sides which allow to
fold down flat this body, the folding lines of two

opposite panels being such that they do not meet each
other but that they define a rectilinear section (b, b')

between each other, the box having a stiffener (2, 3, 4)
which is adapted so as to also fold flat down on the

folded box body and which has a contour corresponding to
that of the bottom of this body, characterized in that

the stiffener consists of several panels (1, 2, 3, 4, 5)
which are articulated together so that they can be folded

down one another, in that the linear section (b, b') is
used for binding the stiffener with the box body and in

that this stiffener moreover doubles the two opposite
sides (C1, C2) of the box body on which it is fastened.
Box according to claim 1, characterized in that
the stiffener is held in place against the bottom of the

box body in virtue of cooperation between extensions (3a)
and slots (3b).
