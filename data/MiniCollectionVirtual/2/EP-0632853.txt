<ABSTRACT>
In the machine proposed, guide rods (24, 32, 34) with thread carriers (26, 36, 38) are disposed over the needles (4). In order to increase the number of guide rods possible and/or to improve access to the guide-rod area, the machine is fitted with at least one group (G1 to G7) of at least two superposed guide rods (36, 38), the guide rods being fitted in such a way that the thread carriers on the superposed guide rods (32, 34) do not cross each other.
