<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a method and a device (46) for controlling the voltage variation of the control voltage (uGS) during a switching-on process (tE) of a power semiconductor (30) which can be turned off and is controlled by means of an electrical field. According to the invention, the voltage variation of the control voltage (uGS) is controlled in dependence on the potential variation at the control electrode (G) of the power semiconductor (30), in such a manner that, at the beginning of the triggering dead time (tp) of the turning-on process (tE), the rise (dup/dt) of the control voltage (uGS) is very much greater than the rise (dur/dt) during the rise time (tr), controlled switching-over between these rises (dup/dt, dur/dt) being effected in dependence on the potential variation of the control voltage (uGS). Thus, the diode breakdown in the case of a fault is automatically controlled by means of the active gate resistor (46) so that no inadmissible drain-source voltage occurs and the turn-on time is not unnecessarily extended in normal operation.
