A desk structure (10) is provided that is adapted for use in a modular work environment. The desk structure has a transparent portion (19) in its top member (11) and incorporates pair of sidewalls (12, 13), a bottom shelf (28), and a back brace (32). The desk structure is cooperatively associated with an underdesk adjustable monitor support assembly (230). The support assembly incorporates a shelf member (231) and a pair of side supports (246a, 246b) and such are all preferably comprised of formed wire. Each side support is associated with desk components including adjacent portions of one sidewall, the top member, the bottom shelf, and the back brace. The shelf member is adjustably associated with the side supports.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a desk comprising in
combination a) structural components including (1) a
top member having a transparent portion and (2) a pair
of side walls supporting the top member; and b) a
monitor support assembly located under the top member. We have previously provided a new and very useful
type of underdesk monitor support assembly for desk
structures, computer work stations and the like that have a
transparent to portion through which a monitor can be
viewed; see European Patent Application Number 91920142.6 (EP-A-0552295).
Although
this type of monitor support assembly is well suited for use
in free standing desks, computer work stations, and the
like, we have observed that such a monitor support assembly
would also be suitable for use in work modules and the like
if a desk structure suitable for use in a modular
environment were available which was cooperatively
integratable with such a monitor support assembly.Although modular office structures are already in
extensive use, the field of use appears to be still growing.
In such structures, wall and even floor surfaces of cubicle
defining members are associatable where practical with
functional furniture components. A common objective in such
structures is to provide a maximized usable working area 
(volumetrically and also surface-area wise). A desk
structure that has a transparent top portion and is
associatable with an underdesk adjustable monitor
support would be well suited for such modular
applications.WO-A1-88/07826, considered during substantive
examination of this application, discloses a data
processing desk comprising in combination a)
structural components comprising: a top having a
transparent portion; a pair of side balls supporting
the top and defining a kneehole therebetween, each
side wall having a bottom edge and a rear edge; and a
desk back plate; and b) a monitor support assembly
located under the top member, the assembly comprising:
a shelf member including a bottom support portion and
an abutment and having lateral opposite ends. The
shelf is supported at its lower (rear) transverse side
by adjustable straps and at its upper (front)
transverse side by a hook for adjustably securing the
shelf to a pivotable kickboard, providing some
positional adjustment for a monitor on the shelf.The present invention provides a desk
comprising in combination
a) structural components comprising:
(1) a top member having a transparent portion;(2) a pair of side walls supporting said top 
member and defining a kneehole

<CLAIMS>
A desk (10) comprising in combination

a) structural components comprising:

(1) a top member (11) having a transparent
portion (19);
(2) a pair of side walls (12, 13) supporting
said top member (11) and defining a kneehole

therebetween, each side wall (12, 13) having a bottom
edge and a rear edge;
(3) a bottom shelf member (28) extending
laterally and rearwardly between said bottom edges of

said side walls (12, 13);
(4) a back brace means (32) extending laterally
across said rear edges of said side walls (12, 13);

and
(5) mounting means (46, 47, 48, 49) securing
said components (11, 12, 13, 28, 32) together;
b) a monitor support assembly (230) located under
said top member (11) comprising:


(1) a further shelf member (231) including a
bottom support portion (232) and a back support

portion (233) and having lateral opposite ends;
(2) a pair of side supports (246A, 246B), each
one positioned adjacent a different one of said

lateral opposite ends;
(3) fastening means securing each side support
(246A, 246B) to said structural components (11, 32);

and
(4) adjustable supporting means (52) for 
engaging said side supports (246A, 246B) with

respective adjacent said lateral opposite ends of said
further shelf member (231);
c) the interrelationship between said structural
components (11, 12, 13, 28, 32) and said monitor

support assembly (230) additionally being such that
each of said side supports (246A, 246B) is in

contacting association with adjacent portions of a
different one of said side walls (12, 13), and also

with said top member (11), said bottom shelf member
(28), and said back brace means (32).
A desk as claimed in claim 1 wherein said bottom
shelf member (28) is supportable in elevated spaced

relationship to a floor surface by a pair of laterally
spaced leg means (29).

second pairs of opposed shelf support means (242A,
242B, 243A, 243B) with a selected one of said load

bearing members (248); so that said further shelf
member (231) is adjustably supported in a desired

location by said pair of side supports (246A, 246B)
