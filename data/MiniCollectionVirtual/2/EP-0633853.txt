<ABSTRACT>
An anti-skidding process and device for vehicles with at least 2 wheels (1-4), of which at least one (1, 4) is steerable, are characterised in that the real rotational acceleration of the vehicle around its normal axis is measured by a rotational acceleration measurement device (7) and compared with the set rotational acceleration calculated by a computer (9) from the steering angle of the steerable wheels (1, 4) and the vehicle speed. The steering angle is measured by a goniometer (6), for example at a steering wheel (5). The speed is measured by a speed sensor (7) at at least one of the vehicle wheels (1-4). The thus calculated difference between the set and real values of the rotational acceleration is set to zero in real time by a device (10) which generates a compensating torque. The device (10) may for example consist of two counterrotating flywheels (12) driven by electric motors (11) which are controllably braked, stopping the skidding process.
