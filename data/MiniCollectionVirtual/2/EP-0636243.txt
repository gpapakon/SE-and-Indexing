<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to modular 
pressure transmitters with flame arresting or quenching 
headers coupled to process pressure lines. Flammable mixtures are often present in an 
atmosphere outside of a pressure transmitter or in a 
process fluid which is being sensed by a pressure sensor 
in the transmitter. Various types of protection reduce 
the likelihood that an ignition of flammable gas inside 
the transmitter will ignite a flammable mixture outside 
the transmitter. For example, transmitter covers are 
fitted with flame quenching threads that cool ignited 
gas as the gas is vented from the transmitter to a 
temperature below the temperature needed to ignite a 
flammable mixture outside the transmitter. Some transmitters are equipped with multiple 
protection arrangements to reduce the likelihood of 
igniting a flammable mixture outside the transmitter 
after one of the protection arrangements fails or is 
damaged. In some applications, a flame quenching path 
is desired that effectively contains ignition of a 
flammable mixture inside a transmitter housing even 
after resilient seals such as O-rings and thin foil 
barriers such as isolator diaphragms have been damaged 
or removed and after isolator fluids have leaked out and 
welds have failed. In the Walish et al. U.S. Patent 4,970,898, 
assigned to the assignee of the present application, a 
transmitter is shown in which a plug includes a liquid-filled 
passageway shaped to provide flame quenching. Some pressure transmitters utilize a modular 
construction such as the transmitter disclosed in the  
 
Frick et al. U.S. Patent 4,833,922, also assigned to 
the assignee of the present application, in which a 
tapered mechanical seal is used to couple process 
fluid from an isolator to a tube leading to a pressure 
sensor. DE-C-4031509 discloses a pressure sensor with a 
flameproof fitting forming an angled passageway 
between two non-aligned orifices. The passageway is 
selected to have a width and length so that it 
provides flameproof properties. The provision of the 
flameproof passageway as a two-section right-angle 
passageway minimizes the actual length or thickness of 
the manifold that is necessary for obtaining the 
flameproofing properties. The present invention includes a transmitter for 
sensing a pressure of a process fluid. A pressure 
sensor is enclosed in the transmitter for providing an 
output representative of pressure. A header includes 
a chamber on an outer face and a passageway extending 
from the chamber to a tapered

sensing means (18,84) disposed within the 
transmitter (8,80) for providing an output 

representative of pressure; 
a header (16,82) having a chamber (48,48A,48B) on 
an outer face and a passageway (54,54A,54B) 

extending from the chamber (48,48A,48B) to 
an opening (56,56A,56B) inside the 

transmitter (8,80), the passageway having a 
first portion (58) adjacent the opening 

(56,56A,56B) shaped to receive an inlet tube 
(52,52A,52B) leading to the sensing means 

and having a second portion (70,70A,70B) 
open to the chamber; 
a diaphragm (42,42A,42B) transferring the 
pressure of the process fluid acting on an 

outer surface of the diaphragm (42,42A,42B)

fluid that isolates an inner surface 
(46,46A,46B) of the diaphragm (42,42A,42B), 

the fill fluid filling the chamber
