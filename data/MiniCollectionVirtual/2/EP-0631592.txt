<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to energy curable
compositions comprising urethane precursors and a
bicomponent curing agent. In another aspect, it
relates to an enhancement of cure speed of polyurethane
precursors and performance properties of the resulting
polymer. The compositions may be used in, but are not
limited to, the following applications: abrasion
resistant coatings, protective finishes, pressure
sensitive adhesives, structural adhesives, coil
coatings, vehicular transportation coatings, automotive
refinish coatings, inks, and other applications
requiring high solids, low volatile organic compound
(VOC) formulations.Various polymeric coatings and articles are
produced in processes involving the use of organic
solvents. There is an intense effort by law makers,
researchers, and industry to promote high and 100%
solids formulations to reduce or eliminate the use of
such solvents and the attendant costs and environmental
contamination. These processes require a latent
catalyst or latent reaction promoter which can be
activated in a controlled fashion.Curing of polyurethane precursors using reaction
promoters such as tin salts or tertiary amines is known
in the art. Curing of polymerizable mixtures of 
polyisocyanates with polyols (referred to as
polyurethane precursors) using latent catalysts is
known in the art (see for example U.S. Pat. Nos.
4,521,545, and 4,582,861).Photocuring of urethane (meth)acrylates is well
known (see T.A. Speckhard, K.K.S. Hwang, S.B. Lin, S.Y. 
Tsay, M. Koshiba, Y.S. Ding, S.L. Cooper J. Appl.
Polymer Science 1985,30, 647-666. C. Bluestein Polym.-Plast.
Technol. Eng. 1981,17 83-93). Photocuring of
polyurethane precursors using diazonium salts, tertiary
amine precursors, or organotin compounds is also known
(see U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,544,466, 4,549,945, and EP
No.28,696, Derwent abstract). All of these methods
suffer from one or more of the following disadvantages:
sensitivity to oxygen, requirement of ultraviolet
and/or high intensity light, need for modified resins,
loss or dilution of urethane properties, low activity,
excessive cure time, poor solubility, and poor potlife.The photocure of urethane prepolymers using a
latent organometaliic salt as catalyst is described in
U.S. Pat. No. 4,740,577 and U.S. Patent No. 5,091,439.
Energy polymerizable compositions comprising, for
example, an ethylenically-unsaturated monomer and
polyurethane precursors and as a curing agent, a latent
organometallic salt, has been disclosed in EP 344,911.
Polyisocyanate coatings are disclosed to be
