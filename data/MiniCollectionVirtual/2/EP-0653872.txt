<ABSTRACT>
A simultaneous voice and data (SVD) modem is coupled to both a fax 
machine, which includes a fax modem, and a telephone set. When the fax machine 

initiates a fax-call, the SVD modem emulates signaling of the local loop. This 
allows the fax machine to operate without requiring modifications to the fax 

machine. After establishing a data connection with a far-end SVD modem, the 
near-end SVD modem demodulates the fax modulation signal from the fax machine 

to recover the fax data. The fax data is then re-modulated using a data modulation 
technique for transmission to the far-end SVD modem. The latter, demodulates the 

data portion of the signal to recover the fax data, which is then re-modulated using a 
fax modulation technique for transmission to a far-end fax machine.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to data communications equipment and, 
more particularly, to the use of a facsimile machine in a simultaneous voice and data 
communications system. The co-pending, commonly assigned, U.S. Patent application of Gordon 
Bremer and Kenneth D. Ko entitled "Simultaneous Analog and Digital 
Communication," serial No. 08/076505, filed on June 14, 1993, describes a 
simultaneous voice and data communications system in which a voice signal is 
added to a data signal for transmission over a communications channel to a receiving 
modem. In this simultaneous analog and digital communication system, the data 
signal to be transmitted is represented by a sequence of data symbols, where each 
data symbol is associated with a particular N-dimensional signal point value taken 
from a signal space. Similarly, the analog signal, which is represented by a voice 
signal, is processed so that it is mapped into the N-dimensional signal space to 
provide a voice signal point. This voice signal point defines the magnitude and angle 
of a voice signal vector about the origin of the signal space. The data symbol and 
the voice signal vector are then added together to select a resultant N-dimensional 
signal point, which is then transmitted to a far-end modem. This form of modulation 
is hereinafter referred to as simultaneous voice and data (SVD) modulation. Upon reception of the transmitted N-dimensional signal point, the 
receiver of the far-end modem detects the embedded data symbol and subtracts the 
data symbol from the received N-dimensional signal point to yield the voice signal 
vector. This voice signal vector is then used to recreate the voice signal. Unfortunately, any data communications equipment that uses the SVD 
modulation technique is not compatible with existing modulation standards for 
facsimile (fax) machines, i.e., fax modems, and standard data modems. For 
example, a fax modem may conform to International Telegraph and Telephone 
Consultative Committee (CCITT) standards T.4 and T.30, which define modulation, 
start-up, and handshaking signaling, etc., that is different from the above-mentioned 
simultaneous voice and data modulation technique. In accordance with the invention, I have realized an advantageous 
method and apparatus that allows an SVD modem to transmit and receive a fax 
signal. In particular, the SVD modem first demodulates the fax signal to recover the  
 
fax data, which is then re-modulated for transmission to a far-end SVD modem. In an embodiment of the
