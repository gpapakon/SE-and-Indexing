<ABSTRACT>
A changeover switch for a tap changer comprises a 
pair of load switches VBA/VBB. A diverter switch 

GTOA/GTOB allows load to be diverted along a second path 
when its associated main switch is opened or closed. An 

auxiliary circuit has an auxiliary switch GTOC and a 
varistor VR connected in parallel across the secondary of 

a transformer T. When the auxiliary switch is opened the 
varistor impedance is reflected onto the primary of the 

transformer which causes the current in the main switch 
to divert through the diverter switch so that the main 

switch can be opened or closed with substantially no load 
on it.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to electrical changeover switches. 
The invention is particularly applicable to switching 
heavy electrical loads, for example tap changers used in 
the regulation of the output of power transformers in, 
for example, electricity transmission and distribution 
networks. At present, star/delta connected power transformers used 
for three-phase electricity distribution networks have 
rated voltage levels in the range of 30 to 420 kV and 
rated currents up to 5000 A. Usually the voltage levels 
of the tap changers are +/- 5-10% of total rated 
transformer voltage, i.e. 22 kV or more, and the current 
ratings range from 300 to 3000 A. Tap changing is the main method of providing regulation 
and control of the output voltage from each phase of a 
power transformer in an electrical distribution system. 
By connecting and disconnecting groups of winding turns, 
the power transformer voltage can be controlled despite 
a varying incoming voltage. The tap changer comprises 
a pair of contacts for connecting a point on the power 
transformer output winding into the circuit. The 
contacts are mechanically driven in an insulating oil 
bath. Conventional tap changers can be divided into two 
categories, i.e. off-circuit tap changers and on-load tap 
changers. Off-circuit tap changers are those by which 
changes are made when the load current is off, while on-load 
tap changers are those in which the changes are 
carried out without interrupting load current. In order  
 
to control large high-voltage distribution networks and 
to maintain correct system voltages on industrial and 
domestic supplies, it is now common practice to use on-load 
tap changers. These have two main features: they 
have impedance in the form of either resistance or 
reactance to limit the current circulating between two 
taps; and a duplicate circuit is provided so that the 
load current can be carried by one circuit while 
switching is being effected in the other. Figure 1 shows an early form of reactor tap changer. 
There is only a single winding on the transformer. A 
current breaking switch is connected to each tap. 
Alternate switches are connected together to form two 
separate groups which are connected to the outer 
terminals of a separate mid-point reactor. The operating 
principle can be described as follows. At a first 
position, switch 1 is closed and the circuit is completed 
through half the reactor winding. To change taps by one 
position, switch 2 is closed in addition to switch 1. 
The reactor then

capable of bearing the said loads along respective first 
electrical paths; a pair of diverter switches,
