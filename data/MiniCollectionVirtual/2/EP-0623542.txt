<ABSTRACT>
The present device serves to form a compact stack of printed sheets compiled upright, in which partial imbricated flows are fed vertically one after the other to a stack support (3), and the stacks (7) are provided at the ends with end plates (5, 12) by means of an insertion device, for which purpose a guiding arrangement (6) for two displaceably driven carrying units (4, 11) is provided above the stack support (3) extending into the range of action of a press (25), which carrying units are assigned, on the stack-forming section, to the stack support (3) as an insertion device for end plates (5, 12), and, on the adjoining section, are designed for driving the stack (7) and as a press (25).

Device for forming a stack (7) which extends vertically to printed
sheets which are piled on edge, comprising a conveyer system

(2) which feeds printed sheets in the form of a scale flow or
successive partial scale flows vertically from the top of a virtually

horizontal stacking base (3), and a feeding device which is
arranged along a stacking base (3) which serves to form stacks

and which establishes the length of each stack by end plates (5)
inserted at the end, as well as a downstream pincerlike press

(25) which compresses the stack (7) and to which is associated a
strapping device (14), 
characterised in that
 above the stacking
base (3), which extends into the operational area of the press

(25), is provided a guide arrangement (6) of two displaceably
driven carrier units (4, 11) associated along the stack forming

section as feeding device of the end plates (5, 12) of the stack
(7), and these carrier units (4, 11) are designed to be effectively

conveying and on the downstream section of the stacking base
(3), which serves the strapping, designed as a press (25) which

compresses the stack (7) in the direction of extent.
Device according to Claim 1, 
characterised in that
 for the
purpose of forming a stack (7) is provided an at least two part

separating device (8), which engages from below at the inlet end
of the stacking base (3) between two printed sheets of a

delivered scale flow or two delivered partial scale flows, and its
part which moves ahead in the direction of stack forming is

associated with the rear end of a formed stack (7), and the
trailing part is associated with the front end of an upstream stack

(7).
Device according to Claim 2, 
characterised in that
 the parts of
the separating device (8) comprise separating (9) and support

elements (10), which are respectively associated with the rear
end or the front end of two successive stacks (7) and which can

be raised and lowered. 
Device according to Claim 3, 
characterised in that
 the section
of a separating element (9) which enters the stack (7) is shorter

than the scale gap of two printed sheets.
Device according to Claim 2, 
characterised in that
 the leading
part (9, 10) of the separating device (8) is designed to be

removable from the trailing part (9, 10).
Device according to Claims 2 to 5, 
characterised in that
 the
separating device (8) is designed to be driven from an idle

position upstream of the inlet end of the stacking base (3) along
the stack forming section and back.
Device according to Claims 2 to 6, 
characterised in that
 the
separating device (8) is driven synchronously with the forming of

stacks.
Device according to Claim 1, 
characterised in that
 the stacking
base (3) is, at least in the front area of the stack forming section,

formed by belts (45) which are continuously driven in the stack
forming direction.
Device according to Claim 1, 
characterised in that
 the support
units (4, 11) are designed to accommodate the end plates (5, 12)

which form the ends of a stack (7) and which are stored at the
side of the stack forming section in a plate magazine (13).
Device according to Claim 1, 
characterised in that
 the support
units (4, 11), which are designed as inserting devices of the end

plates (5, 12), comprise pressure plates (15 to 18) which are
transversely displaceably driven over the top edge of the stack

formed at the stacking base (3).
Device according to Claim 10, 
characterised in that
 the support
units (4, 11) are associated with two pressure plates (15, 16; 17,

18) which are arranged on guide rods (26) and which can be 
offset laterally of the stacking base (3) by means of a drive

element (30).
Device according to Claim 11, 
characterised in that
 the
pressure plates (15 to 18) are selectively designed to be driven

mechanically, pneumatically, hydraulically or electrically.
Device according to Claim 11, 
characterised in that
 the
pressure plates (15, 16; 17, 18) are mounted on the bottom side

of a support (21) which is mounted in the guide arrangement (6).
Device according to Claims 1 to 7, 
characterised in that
 the
guide arrangement (6) comprises two guide rails (19, 20) which

extend opposite each other in the direction of stack forming and
which accommodate the support units (4, 11).
Device according to Claim 14, 
characterised in that
 to at least
one guide rail (19, 20) is connected a toothed rod (39) which

meshes with a drive pinon (38) of a gearing motor (37, 40) which
is mounted to the support unit (4, 11).
Device according to Claim 15, 
characterised in that
 on the
guide rails (19, 20) is provided a respective toothed rod (39) the

associated drive pinon (38) of which is mounted on a common
shaft (41).
Device according to Claim 12, 
characterised in that
 the support
units (4, 11) are designed to be individually driven in the direction

of stack forming.
Device according to Claim 1, 
characterised in that
 they are
designed for single or multiple strapping of a stack (7).
