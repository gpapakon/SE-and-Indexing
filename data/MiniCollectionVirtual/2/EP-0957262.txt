<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a fuel injector for use in delivering fuel under
pressure to a cylinder of an internal combustion engine.In a fuel injector of the type intended for use in a common rail type fuel
system, a number of restricted flow passages must be provided to permit
fuel to flow to the bore within which the valve needle is slidable, and to a
control valve which controls the fuel pressure within a control chamber to
control operation of the injector. It is known to provide such restricted
flow passages by forming appropriate bores or drillings in the nozzle
body, distance piece or valve housing of the injector. However, the
provisions of such drillings or bores requires a high level of precision. As
a result, during manufacture the appropriate drillings and bores must be
machined into each component to form the necessary passages, and the
passages must be honed to the correct dimensions. Each component is
then tested and, if necessary, re-honed. It will be appreciated that such a
manufacturing process is time consuming and expensive.UK patent 2,112,065 (Daimler-Benz AG) describes an internal
combustion engine fuel injection valve filter arrangement. The
arrangement comprises valve elements which are clamped against
one another by a nozzle lock nut and which have inlet bores
leading to the injection needle. A disc-shaped fuel filter is
located between two valve elements whose faces bearing against
the fuel filter have annular grooves which are connected to
the inlet bores. The fuel filter is in the form of a sieve
plate whose sieve openings have a diameter of less than 0.15
mm.It is also desirable to provide a filter in the injector to prevent dirt particles
from flowing to and damaging or impairing the operation of the control
valve. The provision of such a filter increases the number of components
present in the injector thus increasing the cost of the injector and
increasing the complexity of the assembly process. According to the present invention there is provided a fuel
injector comprising a nozzle body, a nozzle holder, and an
adapter plate located between the nozzle holder and the nozzle
body, at least one of the upper and lower surfaces of the
adapter plate being shaped to include formations defining
recesses so as to form a restricted flow passage between the
recesses.Where the injector is to be used in a common rail system, the formations
conveniently define an orifice through which fuel can flow at a controlled
rate towards the bore of the nozzle body, a restricted flow path
</DESCRIPTION>
<CLAIMS>
A fuel injector comprising a nozzle body (10), a nozzle holder (46), and an adapter
plate (26) located between the nozzle holder (46) and the nozzle body (10), at least one of the

upper and lower surfaces of the adapter plate (26) being shaped to include formations
defining recesses (50,54,56,62,70,72,74) so as to form a restricted flow passage (28,60)

between the recesses (54,56,62).
A fuel injector as claimed in Claim 1, wherein the dimensions of the formations are
such that, where a recess formed in the upper surface of the adapter plate (26) aligns with a

recess formed in the lower surface, the recesses open into one another to define a passage
extending through the adapter plate (26).
A fuel injector as claimed in Claim 1 or Claim 2, wherein the adapter plate formations
define an orifice through which fuel can flow at a controlled rate towards the bore of the

nozzle body (10), a restricted flow path permitting fuel to flow at a restricted rate to a control
chamber, and a flow path connecting the control chamber to a control valve.
A fuel injector as claimed in any one of the preceding claims, wherein the adapter
plate formations define a filter (68) arranged to remove dirt particles from the flow of fuel.
An adapter plate suitable for use in a fuel injector of the type defined in any one of the
preceding claims.
A method of manufacturing an injector including the step of micro-machining at least
one of the upper and lower surfaces of an adapter plate (26) to produce formations defining

recesses therein which, in use, form a restricted flow passage between said recesses.
A method as claimed in Claim 6, wherein the dimensions of the formations are such
that where a recess in the upper surface of the adapter plate (26) aligns with a recess in the

lower surface, a passage is defined which extends through the adapter plate (26). 
A method as claimed in Claim 6 or Claim 7, wherein the micro-machining technique
includes at least one of photolithography, x-ray lithography, electroforming and laser micro-machining

techniques.
