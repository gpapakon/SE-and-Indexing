<ABSTRACT>
Apparatus for achieving an optical connection between 
an optical fiber (14) and electro-optic device (18) 

comprises a fiber optic connector comprising a pair of 
elongated connector elements (30,32) having facing 

substantially flat surfaces and an elongated groove (34) 
on at least one of the surfaces for receiving an optical 

fiber to be retained between the connector elements. A 
resilient clamping member (50) maintains the connector 

elements (30,32) in engagement with each other so as to 
retain the optical fiber (14) in the groove (34). A 

coupling portion (52) projecting from the clamping member 
(50) for joining the clamping member (50) with the 

electro-optic device (18) in such a manner that an optical 
fiber retained in the connector is in optical alignment 

with a predetermined portion of the electro-optic device.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention is directed
to an
apparatus for connecting
an optical fiber to an optical input of an electro-optic device according to the pre-characterizing part of claim 1.Electro-optic devices as the term is utilized herein
generally include light emitting diodes (LED's), laser
diodes and detector cells such as p-i-n diodes. In some
applications, it is desired to transmit light to an
optical input or from an optical output of such a device
by means of an optical fiber. Such optical fibers are
well known in fiber optic technology and transmit light
internally by principles of reflectance, based upon the
indexes of refraction of the materials utilized to
construct the fiber.Successful transmission of light energy between an
electro-optic device and an optical fiber is greatly
enhanced by alignment of the axis of the optical input (or
output) of the device with the axis of the fiber. This
alignment must be initially located and thereafter
maintained in order to assure the desired quality of
optical transmission between the fiber and the device
input.The present invention utilizes an optical fiber
connector element for receiving and holding optical fiber
which is to be aligned with an optical input of an
electro-optic device such as a p-i-n diode. Preferably,
the invention utilizes a pair of complementary aluminum
alloy elements of the type which heretofore have been
utilized as splice elements for splicing together a pair
of optical fibers. Such a splice element is shown and
described for example in U.S. Patent no. 5,121,456, which
is commonly owned herewith. However, these elements are
utilized in the present invention to receive and
grippingly engage a single fiber in order to align an end 
part of the fiber in coaxial alignment with an axis of an
optical input (or output) of an electro-optic device.The present invention utilizes mechanical means for
receiving and holding both the electro=optic device and
the connector elements in the proper alignment for
achieving coaxial alignment of an optical fiber end
portion held between the connector elements with the axis
of an optical input of the electro-optic device. While
the ensuing description describes two specific
arrangements for achieving this mounting and alignment
function, other equivalent arrangements might be utilized
without departing from the invention.In accordance with the pre-characterizing part of claim 1,
EP-A-343 964 discloses an apparatus for connecting an optical fiber to
an optical input of an electro-optical device. The
