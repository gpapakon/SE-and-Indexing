<ABSTRACT>
Anti-glare EC mirror comprises a transparent glass 
substrate (12) with ITO film (13), IrO
x
 film (14), 
SnO₂ film (15), Ta₂O₅ film (16), WO₃ 

film (17) and Al film (18) in the order written. Because of this layer 
arrangement, SnO₂ film insures an ample supply of water 

during the aging of IrO
x
 film, thereby allowing the aging 
operation to be completed within a short period of time.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an anti-glare electrochromic mirror in accordance with the
generic clause of claim 1, that is capable of causing electrical changes in reflectance by
utilizing the operating principle of electrochromic displays (ECDs).Such an anti-glare electrochromic (called EC hereinafter) minor is already well known and
will be discussed later on in combination with Fig. 8.Document DE-OS 361 537 911 also discloses an anti-glare electrochromic mirror having a
transparent front substrate with a first transparent electrode film, a back substrate with a
second electrode film, two electrochrome layers formed on the first and second electrode
layers and a liquid electrolyte between the electrochrome layers. The prior art thin-film anti-glare electrochromic mirror shown in Fig. 8 will now be discussed
in detail. As shown, the anti-glare mirror generally indicated by 1 comprises a transparent
glass substrate 2 which is overlaid, in superposition, with a transparent electroconductive
ITO film 3, an oxidatively coloring IrOx film 4, an electrolyte Ta2O5 film 5, a reductively
coloring WO3 film 6, and a reflective film 7 made of Al as an electroconductive material. In
the construction shown in Fig. 8, the ITO film 3 and the Al film 7 serve as electrodes,
between which a dc supply 8 is connected via a changeover switch 9.When contacts a and b of the switch 9, as well as contacts d and e are closed, the positive
terminal of the dc supply 8 is connected to the ITO film 3 whereas the negative terminal of
the same supply 8 is connected to the Al film 7, whereupon a dc voltage is applied across
the mirror 1 and an 
oxidation-reduction reaction occur to initiate a coloring
reaction in the IrOx film 4 and the WO3 film 6. As a result,
the reflectance of the mirror 1 is reduced by the colored
IrOx film 4 and the WO3 film 6 to provide anti-glare effect.
If contacts a and c of the switch 9, as well as contacts d
and f are closed, a dc voltage is applied with opposite
polarity and an oxidation-reduction reaction proceeds in
opposite direction, whereby the IrOx film 4 and the WO3 film
6 become transparent again an the reflectance of the mirror 1
is sufficiently increased to remove the anti-glare effect.The conventional EC mirror described above has had the
problem that if the "aging" of the oxidatively coloring IrOx
film 4 is inadequate, the refractive index difference at the
interface between the IrOx film 4 and the Ta2O5 film 5
increases so much as to develop an intense interference color
on the reflecting
