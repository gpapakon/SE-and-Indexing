<ABSTRACT>
Power supply control system for an asynchronous motor fed from AC mains via a speed controller (10); the speed controller including a rectifier bridge (11) linked to the mains, an intermediate DC circuit (12) (Vbus) equipped with a capacitor (16), an inverter (13) equipped with switches controlled by a control circuit (20), and linked to the phase windings of the motor, characterised in that it comprises a structure (24) with regulations in cascade equipped with a frequency regulator (25), with a current limiter (27) and with a current regulator (26) driving the control circuit (20); the frequency regulator being linked to the input of a ramp generator supplying the starting speed of the motor, and to the output of the current limiter (27), the latter being linked, on the output side, to the current limiter (26). The structure (24) with regulations in cascade is associated with the intermediate circuit in order to limit the DC voltage (Vbus) of the capacitor (16) by virtue of the current limiter.

System for controlling the supply of power to an 
asynchronous motor supplied with power from an AC line 

voltage through a variable speed drive including a 
rectifier bridge connected to said AC line voltage, a DC 

voltage intermediate circuit including a capacitor, and 
an inverter including switches controlled by a control 

circuit and connected to phase windings of said motor, 
wherein: 


said system includes a cascade regulation 
structure including a frequency regulator, a current 

limiter and a current regulator driving said control 
circuit, said frequency regulator input being connected 

to a ramp generator supplying a motor start speed and 
said frequency regulator output being connected to said 

current limiter, the output of the latter being connected 
to said current regulator; 
said cascade regulation structure is associated 
with said intermediate circuit to limit the DC voltage at 

said capacitor by means of said current limiter included 
in said cascade regulation structure. 
System according to claim 1 wherein in the event 
of interruption of the AC line voltage said regulation 

structure limits said DC voltage at the capacitor while 
said motor is operating as a generator. 
System according to claim 1 wherein said DC 
voltage is limited relative to a threshold voltage 

dependent on the nominal AC line voltage and on the 
maximal voltage that said capacitor is rated to 

withstand. 
System according to claim 1 wherein said current 
limiter peak limits positive and negative values of the 

output current of the frequency regulator. 
System according to claim 1 wherein said current 
limiter peak limits positive or negative values of the  

 
output current of said frequency regulator, depending on 

the sign of the motor speed. 
System according to claim 3 wherein in the event 
of interruption of the AC line voltage, in particular a 

very short term interruption, said regulation structure 
limits said DC voltage at said capacitor while said motor 

is operating as a generator if said DC voltage reaches a 
second threshold value less than said threshold voltage. 
System according to claim 1 including a 
processor for measuring said DC voltage and comparing it 

with said threshold voltage signal.
