<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to novel isoxazole derivatives,
compositions containing them, processes for their preparation and
their use as herbicides.EP-A-0 418 175 describes 4-benzoyl-isoxazole herbicides substituted at the 5-position
of the isoxazole ring and having up to five substituents on the benzoyl ring.
EP-A-0 487 357 describes 4-benzoylisoxazole herbicides substituted at the 3- position
and optionally substituted at the 5-position of the isoxazole ring and having up to 5
substituents on the benzoyl ring. Neither document discloses that two
substituents on the phenyl ring in the benzoyl grouping could be replaced by a 5- to 7-membered
ring fused to phenyl.EP-A-0 588 357 discloses 4-heteroaroyl isoxazole herbicides in which a
heterocyclic ring, optionally fused to a second ring, is attached via carbonyl to an
isoxazole ring. The application was filed after the earliest priority date of the present
application.The present invention provides isoxazoles of formula I:

wherein:
Ar represents phenyl optionally substituted by a group R1 and
wherein two substituents on adjacent positions of the phenyl ring,
together with the two atoms to which they are attached, from a
thiophene,
thiophene-S,S-dioxide, thiadiazole, oxazole or pyrrole ring
which ring is optionally substituted by one or two groups R2 which
may be the same or different;
R1 represents:-
a halogen atom or a group selected from -SR3, -SOR3,
-SO2R3, -CH2S(O)pR3, methyl and -OR3;R2 represents a halogen atom, C1-4 alkyl, -SO2R3 or -OR3;R3 represents methyl or ethyl; andp is zero, one or two; 
and agriculturally acceptable salts thereof, which possess 
valuable herbicidal properties.In certain cases the substituents R1, R2, R3 and R4
contribute to optical isomerism and/or
stereo isomerism. All such forms are embraced by the present
invention.Examples of the group Ar include the following optionally
substituted ring systems:
benzo-1,2,3-thiadiazole, benzo[b]thiophene, benzo[b]furan,
benzo[c]thiophene, benzo[c]furan, benzthiazole, 1,2-benzisothiazole,
2,1-benzisothiazole, 1,2-benzthiazin, 2,1-benzthiazin, 1,3-benzothiazine,
1,4-benzothiazine, benzimidazole, indazole, benzoxazole and indole, isoindole.By the term "agriculturally acceptable salts" is meant salts the
cations of which are known and accepted in the art for the
formation of salts for agricultural or horticultural use. Preferably the
salts are water-soluble.Suitable acid addition salts formed by compounds of formula I
include salts with inorganic acids, for example hydrochlorides,
sulphates,
