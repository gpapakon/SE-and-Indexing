A heater element (2), in particular for a toaster, comprising a tube (14)
made of electrically insulating material about which a heating resistive

wire (15) is wound, and at least one electrical connector (1) fixed to the
ends (2a) of the heater element (2) and welded to said heating resistive

wire (15),

said heater element being characterized in that the heating resistive wire
(15) includes at least one end with turns (15a) which is fixed by welding

onto the connector (1), the end with turns being wound helically
thereabout.
A heater element according to claim 1, characterized in that the end with
turns (15a) which is fixed by welding includes turns (15a) that are closer

together than over the remainder of the tube (14).
A heater element according to claim 2, characterized in that the
connector (1) inclu
des a tongue-forming portion (9) about which the end
having closer-together turns (15a) is wound and welded.
An element according to claim 3, characterized in that the tongue (9) is
engaged on the end (2a) of the heater element (2).
