<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to chemical 
modification of polypeptides by means of covalent 
attachment by strands of poly(alkylene glycol) in order 
to improve their delivery of drugs. The potential values of peptides and proteins 
as therapeutics has been recognized for a long time. By 
the same time, their delivery, still today, represents a 
challenge. Historically, before the development of large-scale 
manufacturing processes for human recombinant 
proteins, most proteins and polypeptides that were used 
for therapy were derived from non-human sources. Unfortunately, repeated administration of such 
non-human proteins often induced the development of 
immune responses that resulted in hypersensitivity or 
even death. Furthermore, the development of an immune 
response was also associated with increased protein 
clearance, thus necessitating the use of higher doses to 
maintain therapeutical efficiency. As a consequence, it often resulted in a 
viscious cycle of higher doses inducing immune response, 
increasing the clearance and thus giving rise to lack of 
efficacy. It was believed that the use of human proteins 
such as those produced by the recombinant technology 
would eleminate these problems.  
 An increasingly growing number of recombinant 
human proteins are now commercially available. Also, a 
number of the recombinant proteins have already been 
approved for use by the Food and Drug Administration 
(FDA). Nevertheless, as evaluation of these proteins was 
in progress, it became evident that the hope that 
recombinant technology would solve all the problems 
associated with the therapeutical use of proteins was not 
realized. The difficulty encountered with recombinant 
interleukine-2 (rIL-2) is a typical example. Human interleukine-2 (IL-2), a single 
polypeptide chain containing 133 aminoacids, is glycosylated 
on threonine in position 3, while rIL-2, produced 
in E.Coli is unglycosylated (R.Devos et al, Nucleic Acids 
Res., 1983, 11:4307 and S.A.Rosenberg et al, Science, 
1984, 223:1412). As a result of the lack of carbohydrate moiety, 
rIL-2 is poorly soluble in aqueous solutions at physiological 
pH and has a very short circulatory half-life 
(initial half-life of 7 to 13 minutes and final half-life 
of 70 to 85 minutes - M.T.Lotze et al, J.Immunol., 1985, 
135:2865.- M.W.Konrad et al, Cancer Res., 1990, 
50:2009.). Furthermore, antibodies to rIL-2 have been 
found in patients undergoing clinical trials with the 
recombinant cytokine (M. Allegretta et al, 
J.Clin.Immunol., 1986,
