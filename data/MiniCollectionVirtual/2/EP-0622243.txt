<ABSTRACT>
A media advancing mechanism (100A,100B) advances the print 
medium through a media path during print operations. 

Electrically energized heater elements (108) heat a portion 
of the print medium at the print area (104). A power 

supply (224) supplies electrical power to the heater 
elements and the media advancing mechanism. A single fan 

airflow system with multiple ducts evacuates air from the 
printer, including the print area. The airflow system 

evacuates excess ink spray and carrier vapor from the print 
area, provides cooling for the power supply and other electronics, 

and actively ventilates the preheater (72) and 
print heater (108) to avoid runaway temperatures.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to the field of ink-jet
printers.With the advent of computers came the need for devices
which could produce the results of computer generated work
product in a printed form. Early devices used for this
purpose were simple modifications of the then current
electric typewriter technology. But these devices could
not produce graphics or multicolored images, nor could they
print as rapidly as was desired.Numerous advances have been made in the field. The
impact dot matrix printer is still widely used, but is not
as fast or as durable as required in many applications, and
cannot easily produce high definition color printouts. The
development of the thermal ink-jet printer has solved many
of these problems. Commonly assigned U.S. Patent No.
4,728,963, issued to S.O. Rasmussen et al., describes an
example of this type of printer technology.Thermal ink-jet printers employ a plurality of resistor
elements to expel droplets of ink through an associated
plurality of nozzles. In particular, each resistor element,
which is typically a pad of resistive material about
50µm by 50µm in size, is located in a chamber filled with
ink supplied from an ink reservoir comprising an ink-jet
cartridge. A nozzle plate, comprising a plurality of
nozzles, or openings, with each nozzle associated with a
resistor element, defines a part of the chamber. Upon the
energizing of a particular resistor element, a droplet of
ink is expelled by droplet vaporization through the nozzle
toward the print medium, whether paper, fabric, or the
like. The firing of ink droplets is typically under the
control of a microprocessor, the signals of which are
conveyed by electrical traces to the resistor elements. The ink cartridge containing the nozzles is moved
repeatedly across the width of the medium to be printed
upon. At each of a designated number of increments of this
movement across the medium, each of the nozzles is caused
either to eject ink or to refrain from ejecting ink according
to the program output of the controlling microprocessor.
Each completed movement across the medium can print
a swath approximately as wide as the number of nozzles
arranged in a column on the ink cartridge multiplied times
the distance between nozzle centers. After each such
completed movement or swath, the medium is moved forward
the width of the swath, and the ink cartridge begins the
next swath. By proper selection and timing of the signals,
the desired print is obtained on the medium.In order to obtain multicolored printing, a

<CLAIMS>
An ink-jet printer (50), including a printhead for
ejecting ink droplets onto a print medium (90) in a

controlled fashion at a print area (104), the printer
including an electrically energized heater for heating a

portion of the print medium, apparatus for advancing the
medium through a medium path during printing operations to

position the medium in relation to the printhead, apparatus
for moving the printhead along a traversing direction

transverse to the advancing direction, wherein the print area
extends along a lateral extent along the traversing

direction, wherein the print medium is disposed between the
printhead and the heater at the print area, a single fan air

flow system comprising a single fan (220) and an air duct
system coupled thereto, the duct system comprising an

elongated duct inlet opening (226) disposed immediately
adjacent the printhead and extending along at least a portion

of the lateral extent, and wherein the heater includes an
elongated enclosure extending along a lateral extent of the

print area to define an enclosure space (272), the enclosure
