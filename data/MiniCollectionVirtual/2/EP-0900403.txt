<ABSTRACT>
Optical lens element with a prescription zone, suitable for use in wraparound or protective type eyewear. The element may also include a peripheral vision zone, with no prismatic jump between the zones. Design methods for the prescription zone include temporally rotating a prescription section about a vertical axis through the optical center thereof, and/or decentring the optical axis of said prescription section relative to the geometric axis thereof, and providing partial surface correction for astigmatic and/or mean power errors. For prescription powers in the range -6.0 to +6.0 diopters with 0 to 3 cyl, the optical lens element may be designed such that its front surface can be mounted in a frame of constant curvature of at least 5.0 diopters, with its back surface providing good clearance from temples and eyelashes. Applications include ophthalmic sunglass lenses.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to sunglass lenses,
in particular sunglass lenses with refractive power.It is known in the prior art to manufacture non-corrective
eyeglasses such as sunglasses or protective
eyeglasses having wrap-around segments designed to
shield the eye from incident light, wind, and foreign
objects in the temporal vision field of the wearer.
Goggles of this type are disclosed in EP 0446698
(Bezazel Research & Development).
Corrective wrap-around spectacles are known
from GB 680 400.Visible light and light in the UV region may enter
the eye from angles as high as 100° from the line of
sight.It has not been possible, however, in prior art
sunglasses or protective eyeglasses to provide spectacle
lenses with refractive power. The radii of curvature
required to provide an ophthalmic lens defining a
prescription zone is such that the spectacles would
produce a bug-eyed appearance, which would be
cosmetically unacceptable.Whilst attempts have been made in the prior art to
provide a wrap-around sun shield over otherwise
generally standard prescription eyeglasses, such
products are generally cosmetically unacceptable and
suffer from significant optical distortions.It is accordingly an object of the present
invention to overcome, or at least alleviate, one or
more of the difficulties and deficiencies related to the
prior art.According to a first aspect of the present
invention, there is provided a high curvature spectacle
lens element of positive or negative refractive power
including
   a front and back surface, at least one surface 
being continuous and forming a prescription (Rx) zone
providing a prescription (Rx) correction and a
peripheral temporal zone for providing a shield in the
area of the temples;
   the peripheral temporal zone optionally exhibiting
refractive power,
   wherein, when mounted, the lens element is rotated
towards the temples about a vertical axis through the
optical centre thereof;
   the front and/or back surface being designed to at
least partially adjust for errors induced by said
rotation, including astigmatic and mean power errors in
the prescription zone and having a correction to at
least partially adjust for prismatic errors; and
   wherein the front and/or back surface includes an
aspheric component
having non circular main sections
selected to at least partially adjust
for off-axis astigmatic and mean power errors.The rotation of the lens produces a number of
optical effects and errors, as discussed below.
However, by suitable selection of the combination of
