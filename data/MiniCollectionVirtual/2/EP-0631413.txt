<ABSTRACT>
The invention discloses a method and apparatus for assigning link 
"distance" metrics that result in near optimal routing for a network formed of nodes 

(routers) and links, where each link has a capacity associated with it, and where 
source-destination flows are given. The routing optimality is measured with respect 

to some objective function (e.g., average network delay).

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a method and apparatus for improved routing in
data networks. In particular, the invention discloses a method and apparatus for
routing in shortest path networks that utilize a centralized assignment of link metrics.Computer or data networks, i.e. interconnected collections of
autonomous computers, provide a variety of services such as electronic mail and data
transfer services. FIG. 1 illustrates the structure of a typical computer network. The
first part of the network typically comprises a collection of Machines 102, called
hosts, intended for running application programs. The network also includes
Communication Subnet 104 linking the hosts. The subnet's job is to carry messages
from host to host. The subnet typically comprises two basic components: Routers
(also called Switching Elements, Nodes or Interface Message Processors) 106 and
Links (also called Transmission Lines) 108. Each host is connected to one, or
occasionally several routers. See generally, Andrew S. Tanenbaum, Computer
Networks, Prentice Hall, Inc., Englewood Cliffs, NJ, 1981.The role of routing is to set up paths between nodes of the network for
the efficient utilization of network services and for the efficient transfer of data.
There are several classes of routing problems, e.g., routing in virtual-circuit
networks, routing in datagram networks and routing in shortest-path networks.There is extensive literature on the problem of optimal routing with
respect to a given objective function such as average delay, subject to known link
speeds or capacities and origin-destination (OD) offered traffic. Most efforts in this
area have been focused on the general routing problem. D. G. Cantor and M. Gerla,
"Optimal Routing in Packet Switched Computer Network," IEEE Transactions
Computers, Vol. C-23, pp. 1062-1069, Oct. 1974; Robert G. Gallager, "A Minimum
Delay Routing Algorithm Using Distributed Computation," IEEE Transactions on
Communications, Vol. COM-25, No. 1, pp. 73-85, January 1977; Thomas E. Stern,
"A Class of Decentralized Routing Algorithms Using Relaxation," IEEETransactions on Communications, Vol. COM-25, No. 10, pp. 1092-1102,
October 1977. A basic assumption in the general routing problem is that the flow
from an origin-destination (OD) pair (i.e. between specific nodes in a network) can
be randomized among several distinct paths, which makes the problem
mathematically tractable since the flows at links become continuous variables.
Although the general routing problem represents a large class of flow
