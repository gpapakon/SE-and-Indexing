<ABSTRACT>
In battery-buffered power supply units having a diode, which decouples an intermediate-circuit voltage and an accumulator voltage as a buffer voltage, there is a risk of explosion or of a fire of an accumulator as a consequence of overcharging in the event of the decoupling diode short-circuiting. An accumulator charging current is therefore inhibited when the power supply unit is switched on, and is not released again until a minimum reverse voltage has built up on the decoupling diode as a result of a test current. A voltage which is raised above the accumulator voltage by a predetermined basic amount is produced during operation of the power supply unit. In the event of a defect, the raised voltage is greater than the intermediate-circuit voltage. The accumulator is therefore disconnected.

Method for monitoring a diode (D), which 
decouples an intermediate circuit voltage (UZK) and an 

accumulator voltage (UAKKU), in a battery-buffered power 
supply unit having an intermedia
te circuit voltage (UZK) 
and an accumulator voltage (UAKKU) as the buffer voltage, 

having a series circuit comprising a controllable switch 
(K1), an accumulator and the decoupling diode (D), which 

series circuit is arranged between the intermediate 
circuit voltage (UZK) and a reference potential (GND), 

having a charging circuit (LS), which is connected 
between the accumulator, and the decoupling diode (D), is 

referred to the reference potential (GND) and is used to 
charge the accumulator, when the controlled switch (K1) 

is switched on, in an operating state of the power supply 
unit, and also having a battery protection logic unit 

(BBU), which has an output for a signal (for example 
BBU_ON) which indicates whether the accumulator is 

currently being charged or discharged, characterized in 
that, in a switching-on state of the power supply unit, 

the charging circuit (LS) is inhibited, a test voltage 
(UV) is applied in the reverse direction to the 

decoupling diode (D) via a series resistor (R1), monitoring 
is carried out to see whether a threshold value of 

the test voltage (UV) across the decoupling diode (D) is 
exceeded, after the threshold value is exceeded the 

controllable switch (K1) is switched on and the charging 
circuit (LS) is enabled again, and in that, in the

which corresponds to the accumulator voltage (UAKKU) is  

 
generated and is increased by a predetermined multiplication 

factor at least slightly and reaching at most, 
approximately, the intermediate circuit voltage (UZK) 

and, as a result, in the event of a short-circuited 
decoupling diode (D) with the associated collapse of the 

intermediate circuit voltage (UZK), the value of the 
increased voltage is set above the value of the intermediate 

circuit voltage (UZK), whereupon the controllable
