<ABSTRACT>
A machining unit for an automatic machine-tool comprises a hollow 
body (10) fixed 

to the frame of said machine. In its interior there is arranged a 
spindle (14) housed 

freely rotatably without axial sliding inside a sleeve (12) sliding 
axially inside the 

hollow body (10). The spindle 14 projects from the body (10) at the 
front end so as 

to hold a tool (16), while at the rear end it is supported in a 
rigidly rotatable manner 

and with the possibility of axial sliding by support means (20) made 
to rotate by 

actuating means (28). The axial displacements of the spindle (14) are 
performed 

together with those of the sleeve (12), owing to actuating means 
cooperating therewith. 
At the rear end of the sleeve (12) there is fixed an annular 
collar (30), coaxial with 

said support means (20) and having a greater diameter than the latter. 
Located axially 

opposite the collar (30) there is an internal annular shoulder (31) 
of the sleeve (12), 

coaxial with the spindle (14) and having a greater diameter than 
the latter. The collar 

(30) has at least one radial lug (34,34') sliding in a longitudinal 
slit (36,36') thereof 

when the sleeve (12) is displaced axially. At the rear of the collar 
(30) there is 

provided an annular cavity (38) communicating with the exterior of 
the body (10) via 

two rectlinear ducts (44,44a) for supplying and discharging a fluid 
under pressure and an additional annular cavity (40), coaxial with 

the support means (20), which communicates with the exterior of the body 
(10) via a radial passage (42).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates in general to machining units for automatic
machine-tools for example those with several stations wherein in each station there is
provided one of said units which must perform a specific machining operation on a
workpiece, generally different from that of the other units. These machines are
used when a plurality of machining operations must be performed in sequence on
the same workpiece.Each unit is provided with a spindle which holds a working tool and which is able
to perform, owing to the action of suitable actuating means to which it is connected,
both a rotational movement about its longitudinal axis and a rectilinear movement
towards the workpiece or away from the latter, depending on the type of tool and
the machining operation which the latter must perform.Machining units of the above type are known and it is also known that they consist
essentially of a hollow body inside which there is arranged the spindle supported at
its front end, i.e. that to which the working tool is fitted, in a freely rotatable
manner and without the possibility of axial displacements, by a sleeve also located
inside the aforementioned hollow body. The spindle, at its other end, is supported
by means which permit bidirectional axial displacements thereof and which at the
same time cause it to rotate. These means may be of any kind, such as for
example a longitudinally hollow and splined shaft or a splined bush, inside which the
rear part of the spindle is inserted in a sliding manner without the possibility of
mutual rotation. The rear end of the aforementioned splined shaft or bush projects
outside the hollow body of the unit and is generally formed as a gear so as to be
able to be connected, via a toothed belt or the like, to a drive motor which causes
rotation thereof and hence rotation of the spindle.The sleeve which supports the front end of the spindle, as mentioned above, is rigid
with or as one piece with means which effect its axial and bidirectional
displacements. In this connection it is known that these units, known in the specific
art as "sleeve-type" units, are classified in two quite separate categories depending on
the type of means which effect the displacements of the sleeve. There exist in fact,
as is known, mechanically operated units and hydraulically operated units.In the mechanical units of the first type the sleeve in question is made rigid or as
one piece with a nut which is screwed onto a screw made to rotate by suitable
actuating means. Since the screw is housed
