<ABSTRACT>
2.1 At least some of the electrical components used in an electrical control device are not pressure-resistant. The housing chamber of the control device accommodating these components must therefore be ventilated. For this purpose a ventilating device is usually provided, which also prevents dirt and moisture from getting into the housing chamber. This aim is not always satisfactorily achieved, which can result in operating malfunctions. 2.2 In order to improve the operating reliability of the control device the invention proposes to connect the housing chamber (2) to a pressure relief device (10) of a valve device (11) by way of a connecting device (6). 2.3 Those control devices, which serve for controlling the valve device having the pressure relief device, as are common, for example, in vehicle technology, are the preferred sphere of application of the invention.

<CLAIMS>
Arrangement having a control device (4; 29) and a 
valve device (11; 20), the control device (4; 29) having 

a housing (2; 24) provided with a housing chamber (3; 25) 
for receiving an electrical device (5; 26, 28) for processing 

electrical signals and the valve device (11; 20) 
having a pressure relief device (10; 34) allowing 

pressure equalisation with the atmosphere,
characterised in that
 
the housing chamber (3; 25) is connected directly to the 

pressure relief device (10; 34) 
via
 a connection line (6, 
30, 31, 32). 
Arrangement according to claim 1, in which the valve 
device (11; 20) is electrically controllable, 
characterised 
in that
 the control device (4; 29) is designed 
to control the valve device (11; 20). 
Arrangement according to any one of the preceding 
claims, 
characterised in that
 the control device (29) and 
the valve device (20) have a common housing (24, 37) and 

the connection device is in the form of a housing 
channel (30, 31, 32). 
Arrangement according to any one of the preceding 
claims, 
characterised in that
 a gas-drying device (7) is 
arranged in the connection line (6).  

 
Arrangement according to claim 4, 
characterised in 
that
 the gas-drying device (7) works according to a 
chemical principle.
