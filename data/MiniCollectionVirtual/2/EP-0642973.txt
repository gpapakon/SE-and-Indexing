<ABSTRACT>
Floating stretcher, in particular designed for recovering injured persons from the sea, of the type comprising a metal frame (1) which is suitable for helicopter winching and supports a composite plate (2) which ensures that the assembly floats, characterised in that the composite plate (2) is pivotally fixed to the front of the metal frame (1) and in that means (25, 34) are provided for holding the said plate (2) either in a position which is inclined by a defined angle with respect to the plane of the frame (1) and above the latter, or in the plane of the frame.

Floating stretcher, designed, in particular, for 
recovering injured persons at sea, of the type including a 

metallic framework (1), capable of being winched by 
helicopter and supporting a panel of composite material (2) 

ensuring the buoyancy of the whole, characterized in that the 
panel of composite material (2) is pivotably fixed to the 

front of the metallic framework (1) and in that means (25, 
34) are provided for maintaining said panel (2) either in a 

position inclined at a given angle in relation to the plane 
of the framework (1) and above the latter, or in the plane of 

the framework. 
Floating stretcher according to claim 1, characterized 
in that the means for maintaining the panel in a position 

inclined in relation to the framework is constituted by at 
least one folding prop (25) in two parts (26, 27) hinging 

respectively on the panel (2) and on the framework (1) via 
pins (29, 30). 
Floating stretcher according to claim 2, characterized 
in that the hinges (29, 30) of the prop (25) are disposed at 

the rear of the panel (2) and of the framework (1), with the 
prop (25) folding forwards. 
Floating stretcher according to claim 1 or 2, 

characterized in that a means (33) is provided for locking 
the prop (25) in its extended position. 
Floating stretcher according to any of claims 1 to 4, 
characterized in that the means for maintainaing the panel in 

the plane of the framework is constituted by a bolt member 
(34) mounted slidably in the framework (1) at the rear 

thereof and coming into engagement with a striking plate 
member (35) provided on the rear portion of the panel (2). 
Floating stretcher according to claim 5, characterized 
in that the bolt member (34) is biassed by a spring in the  

 
locking direction and it is designed to engage automatically 

in the striking plate member (35) when the panel (2) is 
placed in the plane of the framework (1). 
Floating stretcher according to any of claims 1 to 6, 
characterized in that a pin (20) is provided for pivotably 

fixing the panel to the front of the framework that 
cooperates with bearings (21, 24) fixed respectively to the 

panel (2) and to the framework (1). 
Floating stretcher according to claim 7 and any of 
claims 2 to 4, characterized in that the pin (20) for 

pivotably fixing the panel (2) to the front of the framework 
(1) and the pin (29) of the hinge of the prop (25) on said 

panel (2) are constituted by removable rods.
