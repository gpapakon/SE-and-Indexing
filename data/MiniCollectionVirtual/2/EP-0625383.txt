<DESCRIPTION>
This invention concerns a line to produce strip and/or
sheet, as set forth in the main claim.To be more exact, the production line according to the
invention is suitable for the balancing of the various
components and for optimising the yield of a production
plant for the rolling in line of strip and/or sheet,
starting from the continuous casting of thin or medium
slabs, and also for ensuring a high level of output.By thin slabs are meant slabs with a width of 700 to 2500
mm. and with a thickness of 30 to 60 mm., whereas by medium
slabs are meant slabs with a width of 700 to 2500 mm. and
with a thickness of 60 to 130 mm.Rolling lines to produce thin and medium strip or sheet
are disclosed in the state of the art; the types usually
employed in the state of the art are substantially two in
number.A first type of line arranges that the continuously cast
slab, after being sheared to size, is sent into a
temperature-restoration furnace of a combustion type.The slab passing through this temperature-restoration
furnace at a low speed has to stay therewithin until the
temperature of the material has been brought to the
necessary value most suitable for the subsequent processes.This method entails the use of furnaces of great sizes up
to 150 metres or more together with problems linked to the
costs of investment, the power employed for heating,
maintenance of the plant and also with problems connected
with an imperfect productivity of the plant.The segment of slab at the outlet of the combustion
furnace is accelerated and then sent for rolling.A second type of plant, such as those of EP-A-0107991 or 
US-A-5,156,800 for instance, provides a quick-heating
assembly, an induction furnace for example, located
downstream of the continuous casting plant and of the
shearing-to-size assembly and followed by a furnace which
makes homogeneous and equal the temperature of the slab.The slab is passes at a low speed through the induction
furnace so as to limit the requirement of power and is sent
thereafter to a rolling train located at the outlet of the
quick-heating assembly.The rolling train works at a low speed with problems of
thermal stress of the rolling rolls.This requires the use of a rolling train oversized as
compared to the other components of the plant.This entails also an imperfect exploitation of the working
assemblies of the production line.JP-A-60-18201 provides a rolling line for normal and
medium slabs, and not for thin slabs, where, downstream of
the casting machine, there is a first quick-heating
