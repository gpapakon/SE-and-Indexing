<ABSTRACT>
For simple and reliable disinfection of waste, in particular hospital waste, where the waste is exposed to heat in waste containers (9) that are tightly closed by removable lids (62), the method developed for the purpose envisages that superheated steam at not below 130 DEG C be fed from a steam boiler (3) from below to one or simultaneously to several waste container/s (9) which contain waste and are sealed in germ-proof manner by removable lids (62). At the same time, this supply of steam is effected over a predeterminable treatment time which only starts when a predetermined internal temperature of at least 110 DEG C is reached in the upper region of the waste container or of all waste containers (9). The temperature of the injected steam is preferably between 130 DEG C and 200 DEG C.
