<ABSTRACT>
The isolation of at least one water soluble glycoside comprising an aromatic moiety group conjugated to mono-, di-, and trisaccharides from hop plant parts other than hop cones is disclosed. A glycoside preparation made by extraction of hop plant leaves with an aqueous alcohol was discovered to confer a pleasant grape flavor to the beer to which the glycoside preparation was added. The glycoside composition of the glycoside preparation made from aqueous alcohol-extracted hop plant leaves was found to differ from a similar preparation made from hop cones.

<DESCRIPTION>
 USE OF GLYCOSIDES EXTRACTED FROM HOP PLANT PARTS TO FLAVOR MALT BEVERAGESCROSS REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONSNot applicable. STATEMENT REGARDING FEDERALLY SPONSORED RESEARCHNot applicable.BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION Hops used in brewing mainly add bitterness and impart a hop flavor (e.g., taste and smell) to the final product. Hops derived from the fruit (cones) of hop plants are composed of soft resins, hard resins, hop oils, waxes, lipids, and carbohydrates. The soft resins consist of -acids and β-acids. The soft resins and a hop oil fraction are extractable by organic solvents, or by liquid and supercritical C02. In conventional brewing, the α-acids are converted into iso-α-acids, which are responsible for the bitterness taste. Although there is a lack of concensus as to how best to describe the character of- hop flavor in beer, it is universally recognized that the hop flavor (or the kettle hop flavor) is an essential aspect of the total organoleptic impact of beer. U.S. Serial No. 08/838,217, which is incorporated by reference herein, disclosed that water soluble glycosides comprising an aromatic compound bonded to a mono-, di-, or trisaccharide may be extracted from hop or hop solids. The hop glycosides thus obtained are precursors to essences and flavorants and can be used to flavor beer.Hydrolysis of the glycosidic bond of the glycosides results in the formation of aglycons and free sugars. It is the volatile aromatic compounds that help confer flavor to beverages such as beer. Conversion of glycosides to their constituent aglycons and sugars can be achieved chemically by acid hydrolysis, enzymatically through the action of specific glycosidases, or 

fermentatively using whole cell biocatalysts such as yeast. The aromatic aglycons may be added to unhopped beer to impart a flavor after fermentation. The use of these kettle hop essences and flavorants provides economy, efficiency, consistency, flexibility, convenience, and quality to the brewing process.The isolation of hop glycoside flavor precursors from hop cones as a source of flavorants used as additives to flavor beer was an improvement over the prior art. However, there remains a need for further improvements in the brewing process.Traditionally, hops used in brewing are derived from the fruit or hop cones of hop plants, and the hop plant leaves and stems are discarded. However, the use of hop cones in brewing has certain disadvantages. The cones of hop plants contain certain hop resins, which can indirectly confer an excessively

(a) extracting a hop plant part other than hop cones with an aqueous alcohol to produce an extract containing polar, water soluble compounds;
(b) concentrating the polar, water soluble compounds in the extract; and
(c) purifying the kettle hop essence and flavorant precursor in the concentrated extract to obtain purified kettle hop essence and flavorant precursor.
2. The method of claim 1, wherein the hop plant part is selected from the group consisting of leaves and stems.
3. The method of claim 2, wherein the hop plant part is leaves selected from the group consisting of fresh leaves, frozen leaves, dried leaves, and spent leaves.
