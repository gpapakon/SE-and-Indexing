<ABSTRACT>
A method and apparatus is provided for improving adherence of metal seed layers (422)
to barrier layers (416) in electrochemical deposition techniques. The method includes depositing

an adhesion layer (421) continuously or semi-continuously without agglomeration onto a barrier
layer (416) prior to depositing a seed layer (422) by controlling the substrate temperature, the chamber

pressure, and/or the power delivered to a deposition chamber. Deposition of the adhesion
layer prevents layer delamination which leads to agglomeration of the deposited layers and

formation of voids in the high aspect ratio features.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a metallization process for manufacturing
semiconductor devices. More particularly, the invention relates to a method for adhering
metal layers to barrier layers.Consistent and fairly predictable improvement in integrated circuit design and
fabrication has been observed in the last decade. One key to successful improvements is
the multilevel interconnect technology, which provides the conductive paths between the
devices of an integrated circuit (IC) device. The shrinking dimensions of features,
presently in the sub-quarter micron and smaller range, such as horizontal interconnects
(typically referred to as lines) and vertical interconnects (typically referred to as contacts
or vias) in very large scale integration (VLSI) and ultra large scale integration (ULSI)
technology, has increased the importance of metal layer deposition and post deposition
treatment techniques of metal layers.The multilevel interconnects that lie at the heart of ultra large scale integration
(ULSI) technology require planarization of interconnect features formed in high aspect
ratio apertures, including the horizontal and vertical interconnects, and other features.
Reliable formation of these interconnects and features is very important to the success of
ULSI and to the continued effort to increase circuit density and quality on individual
substrates and die. As circuit densities increase, the widths of the instruments and other
features, as well as the dielectric materials between them, decrease to less than 0.25 µm,
whereas the thickness of the dielectric layers remains substantially constant, with the result
that the aspect ratios for the features, i.e., their height divided by width, increases.Many traditional deposition processes, such as physical vapor deposition (PVD)
and chemical vapor deposition (CVD), have difficulty filling structures where the aspect
ratio exceed 4:1, and particularly where it exceeds 10:1. Therefore, there is a great amount
of ongoing effort being directed at the formation of void-free, nanometer-sized features
having high aspect ratios wherein the ratio of feature height to feature width can be 4:1 or 
higher. Additionally, as the feature widths decrease, the device current remains constant or
increases, which results in an increased current density in the feature.Copper and its alloys are now being considered as an interconnect material in place
of aluminum, because copper has a lower resistivity (1.7 µΩ-cm compared to 3.1 µΩ-cm
for aluminum), higher
