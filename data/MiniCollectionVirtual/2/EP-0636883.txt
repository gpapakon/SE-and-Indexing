<ABSTRACT>
The present invention relates to a method for enhancing the agglutinating effect of antibodies in diagnostic agglutination tests and/or preventing the occurrence of the adhesive effect by adding casein to the reaction medium. It is possible in this way to detect agglutinates distinctly better because the last dilution stage is unambiguously recognised. The method is particularly suitable both for passive and for active haemagglutination.
