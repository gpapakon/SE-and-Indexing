<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to novel styrene 
derivatives having lipoxygenase inhibiting activity and 
cyclooxygenase inhibiting activity, salts thereof, and 
medical use thereof. It is considered that leukotrienes produced by 
lipoxygenase from arachidonic acid and prostaglandins 
produced by cyclooxygenase from arachidonic acid are 
deeply concerned in a crisis of allergic asthma, allergic 
rhinitis, inflammation, etc. Consequently it is desired 
to inhibit both lipoxygenase and cyclooxygenase in order 
to strongly and properly inhibit various allergic 
diseases, inflammations and other diseases. The 
development of a drug inhibiting both enzymes is 
earnestly desired. The present inventors have conducted a research 
in considering the foregoing problems in the background 
art, and found that novel styrene derivatives as 
indicated in the following formula (1) have an excellent 
lipoxygenase inhibiting activity and an excellent 
cyclooxygenase inhibiting activity, and are useful as a  
 
drug. Thus, the present invention has been accomplished. The present invention provides styrene 
derivatives represented by the formula (1) or a salt 
thereof: 
[wherein R₁ and R₂ are the same or different and each is 
a hydrogen atom, a lower alkoxy group, a halogen atom or 
a lower alkyl group; R₃ are the same or different and 
each is a hydroxy group, a lower alkoxy group, a lower 
alkyl group, a lower alkoxycarbonyloxy group, a lower 
acyloxy group, a di-loweralkyl phosphate residue or an 
amino acid residue which may have a protective group; 1 
is an integer of 0 to 5; m is an integer of 0 to 5. X 
represents a formula -N(Z)CO- {wherein Z represents a 
formula (CH₂)nA (wherein A represents a hydrogen atom, a 
carboxyl group, a di- or mono-loweralkylcarbamoyl group, 
a carbamoyl group, a lower alkoxycarbonyl group, a cyano 
group, a lower alkoxy group, a N-acylamino group, a 
phenyl group which may be substituted, a pyridyl group or  
 
a thienyl group, n is an integer of 0 to 5)} or a single 
bond, Y represents -C(Z')=CH-, -CH=CH-C(Z')=CH-, 
-C(Z')=CH-CH=CH- (wherein Z' is the same as Z), provided 
that when n=0, both Z and Z' are not hydrogen atoms, and 
that when 1 is 0, X represents a single bond]. The compounds of the present invention 
represented by the formula (1) has an excellent 
lipoxygenase inhibiting activity and cyclooxygenase 
inhibiting activity. Examples of lipoxygenases are 5-lipoxygenase, 
12-lipoxygenase and 15-lipoxygenase, etc. 
The compounds of the invention exhibit, in particular, a 
poten
