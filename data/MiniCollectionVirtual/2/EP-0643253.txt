<ABSTRACT>
To achieve simple and uniform production of an oil or grease/air mixture for a mist lubrication system, particularly for small delivery quantities with a high repetition rate, a mist lubrication system with the combination of the following features is proposed:   a. metering pump (P) for lubricants with a cylinder space in the pump casing (5), which cylinder space forms a working and metering chamber (17) and into which a spring-loaded control piston (4) projects from the outlet side and a delivery piston (8) spring-loaded in the same direction of action projects from the inlet side, which delivery piston passes through a lubricant intake space (20) which is connected in a coaxial arrangement to the working and metering chamber (17) and which is connected to an electromagnetic drive (12),   b. mixing element (ME) with a compressed-air and a lubricant connection to a mixing chamber (36) with an outlet passage (39), a swirl-inducing insert (38), preferably the spiral portion of a drill, being arranged in the outlet passage (39), preferably for the purpose of producing two lubricant/air mixture part flows, each of which is assigned one outlet and c. a spray nozzle (40) which is connected to each outlet of the mixing element and the nozzle hole of which has a swirl-inducing insert (41), preferably the spiral portion of a drill.   It is thereby possible, in particular, to achieve simple division of the mixture in the mixing element while retaining homogeneity, without moving parts, and variable use as a flange-lubricating system for rail vehicles is thus possible.

Mixer lubricating system for oil or liquid fat-air 
lubrication, with a lubricant pump (P, P
1
, P
2
), a 
compressed air supply (34) and a mixing element (ME,ME
1
, 
ME
2
) for mixing lubricant and compressed air,
 
characterised by the combination of the following 

features: 

a. Metering pump (P, P
1
, P
2
) for lubricants with a 
cylinder chamber in the pump housing (5) forming a 

working and metering chamber (17) into which 
projects from the outlet side a spring-loaded 

control piston (4) and from the inlet side a 
conveying piston (8) spring-loaded in the same 

direction, which cylinder chamber penetrates a 
lubricant suction chamber (10) which in coaxial 

arrangement is connected to the metering and working 
chamber (17) and which is associated with an 

electromagnetic drive (12) 
b. Mixing element (ME, ME
1
, ME2) with a compressed 
air connection (34) and a lubricant connection (33) 

to a mixing chamber (36) with outlet channel (39), 
whereby in the outlet channel (39) there is arranged 

a twist generating insert (38), preferably the drill 
bit of a drill, p
referably for producing two 
lubricant-air mixture partial streams, which is in 

each case provided with an outlet (45, 46), and 
c. a spray nozzle (40), connected to each outlet of 
the mixer element (ME, ME
1
, ME
2
), whose nozzle bore 
has a twist generating insert (41), preferably the 

drill bit of a drill. 
Mixer lubricating system according to claim 1, 
characterised in that between the mixing element (ME) and 

the nozzle (40) there is arranged a T-piece (47) which 
has in the mixture channel (48) a twist generating insert 

(49), preferably the drill bit of a drill to which are 
connected two outlet bores (50, 51). 
Mixer lubricating system according to claim 1 or 2, 
characterised in that the twist generating insert (38 or 

49) with one flow length for the mixture prior to the 
delivery to the two outlets (45, 46 or 50, 51) is 

provided with a full revolution corresponding to a twist 
of at least 360Â°. 
Mixer lubricating system according to one of the 
claims 1 to 3, characterised in that a backpressure valve 

(37) is arranged in the lubricant supply duct of the 
mixing element (ME) prior to the mixing chamber (36). 
Mixer lubricating system according to one of the 
claims 1 to 4, characterised in that in the mixing 

element (ME) the lubricant supply line is continued as a 
chamber-like drilling (mixing chamber 36) in which via a 

transverse running connecting bore (35) is carried out a 
compressed air supply, wherein the compressed air 

connection is arranged parallel to the lubricant 
connection and through transverse drillings (43, 44) on 

both sides in the region of the twist producing insert 
(38) two outlets (45, 46) are formed for the two mixture 

partial streams. 
Use of a mixer lubricating system according to one 
of the claims 1 to 5 as wheel flange lubricating system 

for rail vehicles, comprising of a magnetic piston pump 
(P) with a mixing element (ME) and a twist nozzle (40).  

 
Use accordihg to claim 6, characterised by a 
mixing element (ME) with two outlets (45, 46), a T-piece 

(47) connected thereto respectively and four twist 
nozzles (40). 
Use according to claim 6 and 7, characterised by 
two parallel operating magnetic piston pumps (P1, P2) with 

mixing elements (ME
