<ABSTRACT>
An apparatus adaptively executing image compression-coding and expansion-decoding, 
such as discrete cosine 

transformation (DCT), inverse discrete cosine transformation (IDCT), inner product operation, image data addition, 
and image data differential operation of the image data of a block of m x n. The apparatus comprises (a) operational 

units (1 to 4) which are arranged in parallel and execute addition, subtraction, various logic operations, comparison 
of sizes, differential operation of absolute values, butterfly addition and subtraction, multiplication, and cumulation, 

(b) mutual connecting pipe line memories (5 to 7) which are so arranged as to connect the adjacent operational units 
to each other among those operational units, and (c) data selector (41 to 44) which selectively apply input data to the 

operational units (1 to 4). Adjacent operational units are connected to each other through mutual connecting pipe line 

memories, and inner pipe line memories in the operational units are selected, forming predetermined data flow paths 
for executing video signal processing such as DCT.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a central processing
unit (processing apparatus) in a computer system used for
example for calculation of numerical values, image
processing, graphic processing, etc., and particularly
relates to an adaptive video signal processing apparatus,
for example, a digital signal processor (DSP), suitable
for video signal processing such as image compression and
encoding (CODEC).In recent years, a large number of digital signal
processors (DSP) for image codex have been proposed based
on image compression and encoding/expansion and decoding
standards such as the CCITT H. 261 recommendation, MPEG,
or the like.Among these DPS', the present invention relates to a
DSP of a "single instruction stream · multiple data stream
(SIMD)" control system which has a plurality of processing
units each comprising an arithmetic and logic unit,
multiplier, accumulator, etc., wherein these processing
units perform parallel processing on a plurality of data
by a single instruction flow, as disclosed in Yamauchi et
al, "Architecture and Implementation of a Highly Parallel 
Single-Chip Video DSP", IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON CIRCUITS AND
SYSTEMS FOR VIDEO TECHNOLOGY, VOL. 2, NO. 2, JUNE 1992,
pp. 207-220.The configuration disclosed in this reference is
shown in Fig. 1. The processing unit of this DSP can
connect processors in a pipeline and also performs
pipeline processing of computations.A simple explanation will be made first of a
principle of the computation pipeline.Figure 2 shows an example of the configuration of the
computation pipeline. This computation pipeline is one in
which two inputs X and Y are added at an arithmetic and
logic unit (ALU) A1, the result of addition and the
coefficient from a coefficient memory A3 are multiplied at
a multiplier A2, and the result of that multiplication is
then accumulated at an accumulator A3. Continuous
performance of a chain of such computations with respect
to a plurality of data is called "computation pipeline
processing".Figure 3 is a graph showing a timing chart of the
processing in the computation pipeline of Fig. 2. For
simplification, it is assumed that the processors A1, A2,
and A4 of the computation pipeline complete the
computation in one clock cycle.The "unit of processing" in Fig. 3 means a set (X, Y)
of the data input to a two-input terminal.As shown in Fig. 3, when looking for example at the 
i-th unit of processing,
in the (k-1)-th clock cycle, the ALU (A1) performs
addition processing;in the k-th clock cycle, the multiplier A2 performs
multipli
