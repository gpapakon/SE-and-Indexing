<ABSTRACT>
A method for treating an aqueous system comprising 
adding to the system a water-soluble or water-dispersible 

polymer containing an ultraviolet radiation sensitive 
moiety and having a CA 500 cloud point of greater than 10 

ppm. The polymers of this invention are directly 
monitorable in the treated aqueous system with 

conventional ultraviolet spectrometers and may be 
quantified by applying chemometrics algorithms to the 

measured spectra.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention is directed to certain novel 
polymers which are useful for treating aqueous systems 
and more particularly to water-soluble or water-dispersible 
polymers which are ultraviolet responsive and 
which are not easily precipitated by the presence of 
hardness in aqueous systems. Much of water used in cooling water systems is 
supplied by the rivers, lakes, ponds, or the like and 
contains various amounts of scale-forming salts. In 
cooling tower systems, the cooling effect is achieved by 
evaporation of a portion of the circulating water in 
passing over the tower. Because of the evaporation which 
takes place in cooling, the solids in the water become 
concentrated. Because of the inverse solubility of 
calcium carbonate, calcium sulfate and other hardness 
salts, the problem of the formation of water-insoluble 
scales on the heat transfer surfaces is intensified. 
Scaling is also a serious problem in steam generating 
systems. Water soluble polymers such as sodium 
polyacrylate and sodium polymethacrylate have been used 
as scale inhibitors and dispersants. However, many of 
these polymers are easily precipitated by hardness. In 
addition, these polymers are difficult to analyze to 
assure maintenance of proper dosage levels. For these 
reasons, the use of these polymers for treating water has 
not been completely satisfactory. It is an object of this invention to provide novel 
water-soluble or water-dispersible polymers which are  
 
useful for treating aqueous systems to inhibit scale 
and/or corrosion. It is another object of this invention to provide 
novel water-soluble or water-dispersible polymers which 
are useful for treating aqueous systems which are U.V. 
responsive and are thus easily and directly monitorable 
in the aqueous system with a U.V. spectrometer. It is another object of this invention to provide 
novel water-soluble or water dispersible, U.V. responsive 
polymers which are not easily precipitated in hard water 
systems. In accordance with the present invention, there have 
been provided certain water-soluble polymers which 
contain one or more ultraviolet radiation responsive 
moieties and which have a cloud point greater than 10 ppm 
as determined by a CA500 cloud point test. The present invention is directed to certain novel 
water-soluble or water-dispersible polymers which contain 
one or more ultraviolet (U.V.) responsive moieties and 
which are insensitive to hardness in the aqueous system, 
i.e., they do not easily precipitate in hard water 
systems.
