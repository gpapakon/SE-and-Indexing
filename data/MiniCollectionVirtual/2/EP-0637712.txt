<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a linear sequence of taps. The linear sequence consists of plates and of taps, each plate (1) being equipped on two opposite edges (1a, 1b) with fastening means (3-6) making it possible to fix the plates end to end, and each plate bearing on at least one face, one or more taps (2) or being equipped on this face with means (11, 14) for fitting one or more taps, and each tap including a plug (ball) (13) into which there emerges at least three joining pieces (7-9) secured to the said plug, two of the joining pieces (7-8) respectively a male one and a female one, being opposed and aligned along an axis which is perpendicular to the said opposite edges of the plate when the tap is fixed on to the plate, and the third joining piece (9) being arranged obliquely or perpendicularly relative to the two aligned joining pieces, the said tap being designed to control a communication of fluid between the aligned joining pieces and the third joining piece and the said aligned joining pieces being designed so that these male and female joining pieces gradually fit together when the plates (1) which bear the taps (2) are fastened end to end. The invention applies especially to linear sequences of taps for medical use.

<CLAIMS>
A strip of cocks, in particular for medical use, characterized in 
that it is constituted by plates and by cocks, each plate (1) being 

provided on two opposite edges (1a, 1b) with fastening means (3-6) 
enabling the plates to be fixed together end-to-end, and each plate 

carrying on at least one face one or more cocks (2) or being provided 
on said face with means (11, 14) to which one or more cocks can be 

mounted, and each cock comprising a plug (13) to which at least three 
endpieces (7-9) secured to said plug open out, two of the endpieces 

(7-8), respectively a male endpiece and a female endpiece, being in 
alignment and opposite to each other on an axis that is perpendicular 

to said opposite edges of the plate once the cock is fixed on the 
plate, and the third endpiece (9) being disposed obliquely or 

perpendicularly relative to the two aligned endpieces, said cock 
being designed to control fluid communication between the aligned 

endpieces and the third endpiece, and said aligned endpieces being 
designed so that said male and female endpieces engage mutually from 

cock to cock when the plates (1) carrying the cocks (2) are connected 
together end-to-end. 
A strip according to claim 1, characterized in that the fastening 
means comprise a tenon (3) on one edge (la) of the plate and a 

mortise (4) on the opposite edge (1b) of the plate. 
A strip according to claim 1 or 2, characterized in that the 
fastening means comprise two catches (5, 6), one on one edge (la) of 

the plate and the other on the opposite edge (1b) of the plate, in 
respective positions that enable the catch on one edge of one plate 

to co-operate with the opposite catch on the edge of a contiguous 
plate. 
A strip according to claim 1 or 2, characterized in that the 
fastening means comprise a vertical rib (17) on a tongue (18) 

extending an edge of the plate, and a vertical groove (19) on the 
opposite edge of the plate.  

 
A strip according to any one of claims 1 to 4, characterized in 
that the plate (1) includes, on a face thereof, at least one ring 

(11) for receiving the base (12) of a cock (2). 
A strip according to any one of claims 1 to 5, characterized in 
that the plates (1) are integrally molded out of a synthetic resin. 
A strip according to any one of claims 1 to 6, characterized in 
that the aligned endpieces (8, 7) of a cock respectively include a 

moving nut (29) and an end (10) having an outside thread, such that 
the nut-carrying endpiece of the cock on one plate can be fixed to 

the threaded endpiece of the cock on a contiguous plate by screwing 
the nut onto the threaded end. 
A plate as defined in any one of claims 1 to 7. 
A cock as defined in any one of claims 1 to 7.
