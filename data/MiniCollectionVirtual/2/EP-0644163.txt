<ABSTRACT>
The initial stages in the manufacture of a glass-like 
mineral fiber suitable for a multiplicity of industrial 

uses are essentially conventional; a charge of raw minerals 
(igneous rock, basalt, slag from a blast furnace or other 

metal working furnace, phosphate slag, etc.) is melted, then 
spun and collected to produce a fibrous mineral "blanket" (19). 

The "blanket" is chopped up, separated, and screened, 
producing a prilled material constituting a multiplicity of 

mineral fiber pellets (37) of given average size. These pellets (37) 
are subjected to brief, rapid acceleration, as by contact 

with a high-speed toothed rotary wheel (32, 33), to accelerate and 
stress the pellets (37) into an industrially usable material (39) 

constituting a multiplicity of shredded, flake-like mineral 
fiber elements, at least one such element for each pellet (37).

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a process and a system for the
manufacture of a flake-like mineral fiber material.Mineral fiber is a low cost, fibrous mineral
product that can be manufactured from a variety of materials
including igneous rock and basalt, from slag produced by the
blast furnaces used to make steel and other metals, and from
waste products from the phosphate industry. Generally
speaking, although mineral fiber has an appearance similar to
glass fiber, its chemical composition is significantly
different from that of glass fiber, due to high calcium and
magnesium content in the mineral fiber and a relatively low
proportion of silica and alumina in it. Mineral fiber is
suitable for use in many high temperature applications, 650 to
980°C
(1200° to 1800°F). Industrial uses are many and varied.Known processes for the manufacture of mineral
fiber material usually start by melting a mineral charge in
any one of a variety of different types of furnace, including
cupola melters similar to blast furnaces, electrical
furnaces, and gas fired furnaces. The molten material from
the initial furnace or melter stage is then spun by any of a
variety of means to form discrete fibers. The fibers are
then collected in a large chamber from which the output is a
fiber blanket, a fiber board, or even pellets of loose fiber.
One example is disclosed in US-A-2375284.Most known processes convert only approximately
fifty percent to seventy-five percent of the molten minerals
into usable mineral fiber. The remainder of the original 
molten mineral ends up as fine, substantially spherical shot
waste, which has little or no useful purpose and constitutes
a contamination in the finished product. Separation of this
fine, substantially spherical shot waste from the mineral
fibers has been attempted; typical techniques include
centrifugal air separation, air transport dropout devices,
and a variety of screening methods that have used gravity
driven inclined screens as well as screens with both
oscillating and rotary mechanical drives.These separation or cleaning techniques, however,
may also introduce some substantial problems. Thus, the high
aspect ratio (diameter in relation to fiber length) of the
fibrous material, in combination with the abundant mechanical
contact that occurs in any of the known separation
techniques, results in the mineral fiber product becoming
clumped or entangled (prilled) into relatively tight, small
nodules or pellets. These pellets can be quite difficult to
disperse into viscous liquids where they

A process for the manufacture of a
flake-like mineral fiber material, comprising the steps of:


A. melting a charge of raw mineral such as igneous
rock, slag from a metal furnace, or the like to produce a

molten mineral stream (44);
B. spinning and attenuating the molten mineral
