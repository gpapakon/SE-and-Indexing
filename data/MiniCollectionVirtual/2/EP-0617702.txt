<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a glaze for ceramic articles. 
In particular the invention relates to a high productivity 
ceramic glaze for sanitary ceramic articles. Hydrophobically modified hydroxyethylcellulose is known 
from U.S. 4,228,277 to be a clear effective thickener in 
latex paint compositions and shampoos. Since the time of 
the initial discovery of these associative thickeners, 
additional applications have been discovered such as paper 
coating compositions, etc. Ceramic greenware can be decorated and coated with a 
variety of glazes prior to firing. When sanitary ceramic 
articles are produced, the glaze must meet the same exacting 
requirements as for decorative ceramic articles. Sinks and 
toilets must be fired using glazes meeting sanitary 
requirements and be suitable for extended service. Cellulose ethers and xanthan gums have been used as 
thickeners and binders for such sanitary ceramic glazes. 
Upon firing, these polysaccharides decompose and form the 
glaze glass and metal oxide deposit on the ceramic article. 
Varial® ceramic glaze, for example, is a blend of 
approximately 20% xanthan gum with 80% sodium polyphosphate, 
available from Chemische Werk Tübingen of Germany. A particularly useful sanitary ceramic glaze comprises 
feldspars, clays, kaolin, quartz metal oxides and frits all 
together called ceramic raw materials. These ceramic raw  
 
materials are suspended in water and stabilized by a mixture 
of xanthan gum and sodium polyphosphate. Yet even with its 
advantages and demonstrated utility there were problems of 
high cost and limited workability. It remained for the 
present invention to provide a high value in use of sanitary 
ceramic glaze which could overcome the disadvantages of the 
prior art. It is an object of the invention to provide a sanitary 
ceramic glaze comprising a thickening amount of a 
hydrophobically modified hydroxyethylcellulose ether having a 
hydroxyethyl Molar Degree of Substitution (M.S.) between 1.5 
and 4.5 and a weight percent hydrophobic modification 
between 0.1 and 2.0. A preferred ceramic glaze comprises in percent by weight 
water 20 to 60, ceramic raw material 40 to 80, 
hydrophobically modified hydroxyethylcellulose 0.05 to 2.0, 
sodium polyphosphate optional 0 to 10, and preservative 0.01 
to 0.2. The advantages provided with the use of the glaze 
include lower cost, shorter drying time, improved sag and 
run resistance, reduced foam formation (reduced pinholes), 
and greater binder resistance. The glaze is storage stable 
for up to 3

<CLAIMS>
A ceramic glaze comprising a thickening amount of a 
hydrophobically modified hydroxy ethyl cellulose ether 

having a hydroxy ethyl molar degree of substitution 
(M.S.) between 1.5 and 4.5 and a weight percent 

hydrophobic modification between 0.1 and 2.0. 
The ceramic glaze of claim 1 where the hydroxy ethyl 
cellulose ether is hydroxy ethyl cellulose or ethyl 

hydroxy ethyl cellulose. 
The ceramic glaze of claim 1 used for sanitary ceramic 
articles. 
The ceramic glaze of claim 3 containing on a weight 
percent basis: 


Water
30-40 
Ceramic raw materials
60-70 
HMHEC
0.1-0.5 
Sodium Polyphospate
0-10 
A process for glazing sanitary ceramic articles 
comprising the steps: 


(1) spraying an unglazed ceramic article with an aqueous 
glaze of a ceramic raw material selected from the group 

of feldspars, clays, kaolin, quartz, metal oxides, frits 
and hydrophobically modified hydroxyethylcellulose as 

defined in claim 1 and optional sodium polyphosphate; 
(2) drying until the article can be handled without 
marring the surface glaze; and 
(3) firing to produce a glazed sanitary ceramic article. 
The process of claim 5 where the glaze has a percent 
solids of 40 to 80 and a flow viscosity of 4000-10000 

mPas at a shear rate of 10 sec⁻¹ and a viscosity of 700-1000 
at a shear rate of 100 sec⁻¹ at 20°C.
