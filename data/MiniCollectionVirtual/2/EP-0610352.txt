<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a device (51) for inserting elongated artificial grass fibres (30) into the ground. The device (51) is provided with a frame (40), which is movable across the ground and which has at least one planting pin (25) being movable up and down in the frame (40), as well as with means for placing an artificial grass fibre (30) to be inserted into the ground under said planting pin (25), in such a manner that the fibre in question can at least partially be pressed into the ground by the planting pin (25) subsequently moving downwards. Preferably the device is provided with a plurality of planting pins (25), which are arranged in a row extending transversely to the intended direction of movement of the device, and which can jointly be moved up and down with respect to the frame by setting means.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a device for inserting elongated 
artificial grass fibres into the ground. As explained in the prior Dutch Patent Application no. 9100202 
it may be desirable to insert artificial grass fibres into the ground in 
order to improve a field comprising natural grass, which is e.g. used for 
practising sport of the like. With such a construction the artificial grass fibres must be 
inserted into the ground individually. In view of the large dimensions of a 
playing field and the desired rather small spacing between the fibres, 
inserting the fibres by hand will take up too much time and be too costly. The object of the invention is therefore to provide a 
possibility to effect said inserting into the ground of individual 
artificial grass fibres by a device. This can be achieved in an efficient manner by means of a device 
which is provided with a frame, which is movable across the ground and 
which has at least one planting pin being movable up and down in the frame, 
as well as with means for placing an artificial grass fibre to be inserted 
into the ground under said planting pin, in such a manner that the fibre in 
question can at least partially be pressed into the ground by the planting 
pin subsequently moving downwards and which is characterised in that 
hold-down means for placing an artificial grass fibre are coupled to the 
up-and-down movable planting pin, said hold-down means being movable up and 
down with respect to the planting pin and cooperating with a guide plate 
disposed under the planting pin in the frame, over which guide plate the 
artificial grass fibre to be planted is passed.  
 It is noted that from US-A-3,937,158 there is known a device for 
supplying artificial yarns to a tufting station where said yarns are 
applied to a backing layer. Further from US-A-3,155,058 there is known a machine for the 
planting of rice seedlings wherein seedlings to be implanted are dropped 
into a chute. By means of a blade of a planting rod the seedlings are 
carried down from the chute and planted into the soil. The invention will be explained in more detail in the following 
description, wherein reference is made to the accompanying drawing, in  
 
which: 
Figure 1 diagrammatically illustrates the operation of an 
embodiment of a device according to the invention for planting artificial 
grass fibres into the ground; Figure 2 is a diagrammatic, perspective view of an embodiment of 
a device according to the invention for planting artificial grass fibres 
into the ground;
</DESCRIPTION>
<CLAIMS>
A device for inserting elongated artificial grass 
fibres (30, 80) into the ground, which device is provided with a frame 

(40, 53), which is movable across the ground and which has at least one 
planting pin (25, 61) being movable up and down in the frame (40, 53), 

as well as with means for placing an artificial grass fibre (30, 80) to 
be inserted into the ground under said planting pin (25, 61), in such a 

manner that the fibre (30, 80) in question can at least partially be 
pressed into the ground by the planting pin (25, 61) subsequently moving 

downwards, characterized in that hold-down means (66, 67) for 
placing an artificial grass fibre are coupled to said planting pin (25, 

61), said planting pin (25, 61) being movable up-and-down perpendiculary 
to said frame (40, 53), said hold-down means (66, 67) being movable 

up and down with respect to the planting pin (25, 61) and cooperating with 
a guide plate (70) disposed under the planting pin (25, 61) in the frame 

(40, 53) over which guide plate (70) the artificial grass fibre (30, 80) 
to be planted is passed and against which guide plate (70) said hold-down 

means (66, 67) are pressed.  
 
A device according to claim 1, characterized in that said device 
is provided with a plurality of planting pins (25, 61), which are arranged 

in a row extending transversely to the intended direction of movement of 
the device, and which can jointly be moved up and down with respect to the 

frame (40, 53) by setting means (59). 
A device according to claim 1 or 2, characterized in that said 
guide plate (70) is provided with recesses (72), extending in the 

longitudinal direction of the artificial grass fibre (30, 80), for 
receiving the artificial grass fibre (30, 80), passages (71) being provided 

near said recesses (72) in the guide plate (70) for passing said planting 
pins (25, 61).  

 
A device according to any one of the preceding claims, 
characterized in that clamping means (73, 74, 91, 94, 95) are provided on 

both sides of the guide plate (70), by means of which the ends of 
artificial grass fibers (30, 80) can be clamped down, whilst said clamping 

means (73, 74, 91, 94, 95), together with the guide plate (70), are 
provided on a support member (83) which can reciprocate in the intended 

direction of movement in the frame (40, 53). 
A device according to claim 4, characterized in that said 
support member (60) being reciprocatingly movable in the frame (40, 53) is 

provided with cutting means (89), which can reciprocate in vertical 
direction. 
A device according to any one of the preceding claims,

movable cutting means (89), said clamping means cooperating with clamping 
means (94, 95) provided on the support member (83). 
A device according to any one of the preceding claims, 
characterized in that the frame (40, 53) is provided with guide bushes (20, 

81) for threads (80), from which the artificial grass fibers (30, 80) are 
cut, and that clamping means (82) are connected to the bushes (20, 81) for 

clamping down the threads (80) in the bushes. 
A device according to any one of the preceding claims, 
characterized in that the device is provided with a reel (76), on which 

threads (80) are wound, from which the artificial grass fibers (30, 80) are
