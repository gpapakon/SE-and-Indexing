<ABSTRACT>
A trocar catheter (110) includes a trocar rod (121) having a stepped diameter distal end for use with a catheter having a stepped diameter lumen wherein the trocar (120) is inserted into the lumen (113) of the catheter and the trocar is used to incise a patient and install the catheter after which the trocar is removed from the lumen of the catheter. The distal end (130) of the trocar rod (121) is provided with a stepped coaxial bore (132) into which a piercing point rod, a spring (140) and a safety sleeve (144) are assembled. The piercing point rod (122) has a proximal small diameter portion (138) which is press fit into a correspondingly small diameter portion of the coaxial bore (132) in the distal end of the trocar rod (121). The spring (140) is carried on the small diameter portion of the piercing point rod (122) and biases the safety sleeve (144) in a distal direction. The distal end of the piercing point rod has a larger diameter portion (123) tapering to a piercing tip (125) and the safety sleeve has a stepped inner diameter which prevents it from moving beyond a predetermined distal position covering the piercing tip (125). The stepped coaxial bore (136) has a large diameter portion for receiving the safety sleeve when it is pressed proximally against the spring. A protrusion (150) on the distal outer surface of the safety sleeve (144) prevents the catheter (110) from accidentally slipping off the trocar (120).

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a surgical trocar catheter for
drainage. More particularly, this invention relates to a
trocar for use with a drainage catheter where the trocar has a
spring biased safety shield mechanism.Trocar catheters for drainage are well known in the
surgical arts. These devices generally include a flexible,
partially elastic catheter and a metal trocar which is
removably inserted into the catheter. One such known device
is a chest drainage trocar catheter shown schematically in
longitudinal cross section in prior art Figure 1. The prior
art chest drainage trocar catheter device 10 includes a
flexible partially elastic catheter 12 which is approximately
nine and one half inches long having a cross section of
approximately one quarter of an inch and an inner diameter
defining a lumen 13 of approximately one eighth of an inch.
The lumen 13 has a stepped smaller diameter portion 16 at the
distal end 14 of the catheter. The proximal end 18 of the
catheter is flared for coupling with a drainage conduit or
syringe (not shown). The distal end of the catheter
preferably includes a plurality of openings or ports (not
shown) for drainage. A metal trocar 20 approximately eleven
inches long having an outer diameter of approximately one
eighth of an inch is inserted into the lumen 13 of the
catheter 12. The distal end of the trocar has a piercing
point 22 and the proximal end of the trocar has a small
circular gripping or pushing plastic base 24. The piercing
point 22 of the trocar has a stepped smaller outer diameter 26
which mates with the stepped smaller inner diameter 16 of the
distal end of the catheter so that the piercing point extends
a predetermined fixed length beyond the distal end of the 
catheter. The trocar 20 is thereby prevented from passing
beyond that point through the catheter. The stepped diameters
of the trocar and catheter also insure that forward movement
of the trocar 20 carries the catheter 12 with it.In use, a sterile catheter with an inserted sterile
trocar is removed from a sterile package, taking care that the
catheter does not slip off the trocar. The surgeon grasps the
proximal end of the catheter typically with four fingers
wrapping around the catheter and thumb resting on the base of
the trocar. The device is thrust into a patient's chest
whereby the piercing point of the trocar incises the chest.
The catheter, carried by the trocar, is forced through the
incision into the chest cavity of the patient. After an
appropriate length of the catheter has been inserted into

A trocar (120) for use with a catheter (112)
having a stepped diameter lumen (113), wherein said trocar (120) is

inserted into the lumen (113) of the catheter (112) and said trocar (120) is
used to incise a patient (200) and install the catheter (112) after which

the trocar (120) is removed from the lumen (113) of the catheter (112), said
trocar (120) comprising:


a) a safety sleeve (142) having a distal larger inner diameter
portion (144) and a proximal smaller inner diameter portion (146);
b) a piercing point rod (122) having a distal larger outer
diameter portion (123) tapering to a piercing tip (125) and a proximal
