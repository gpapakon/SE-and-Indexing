<ABSTRACT>
Coatings based on copolymers of ethylene with glycidyl co-monomer, optionally containing a filler such as zinc powder or flake, provide corrosion protection for metals such as steel. They may be used alone as a sole coating, or as a primer coating with an outer coating of an olefin-based polymer.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to thermoplastic anti-corrosion coatings,
particularly primer coatings for metals. More particularly, it relates to
copolymers of ethylene with a co-monomer containing a glycidyl group,
optionally with a filler such as zinc, which can be applied as a thermoplastic
coating to prevent corrosion of metals. The coating may be used alone as a sole
coating but preferably is used as a primer coating under an outer coating that
provides mechanical protection for the primer coating.Metal vessels, pipes and other forms used for containing and
transporting a variety of materials are subject to corrosion or erosion by the
contained or transported materials. Metal objects are also subject to corrosion
or erosion by the environment with which they come into contact. For example,
soil, salt water or atmospheric and climatic conditions can have a harsh effect
on metal.To protect against such corrosion and erosion, metals are
commonly coated with plastic materials. In addition to providing protection
against corrosion or erosion, certain plastic coatings provide desirable
properties inherent in the plastic being used. For example, a very smooth
surface can reduce the coefficient of friction in a pipe thus reducing the energy
needed to pump a fluid through the pipe.To provide effective protection against corrosion, a coating
should have good adhesion to the metal and should be relatively impermeable
to agents which could, in themselves, cause corrosion of the metal or to agents
which cause a loss of adhesion of the coating to the metal. Poor initial adhesion
or subsequent loss of adhesion will allow the metal itself to become directly
exposed to corrosive environments. Thus, both impermeability and long term
adhesion are important characteristics of a good corrosion-prevention coating.Coating materials differ in their advantages, however. Polyolefin
thermoplastic coatings such as polyethylene or polypropylene are resistant to
water and chemicals, but they do not adhere well to metals. By contrast,
ethylene copolymer ionomers, which are ion-neutralized ethylene (meth)acrylic
acid copolymers, provide a high level of adhesion to metals, are tough and
provide good abrasion resistance, but are water sensitive and permeable. Adhesion and permanence of that adhesion to metals are
complex phenomena. Loss of adhesiveness may be due to mechanical or
chemical causes. Differential thermal expansion of the metal and the coating
can cause mechanical failure of the bond between them, while many agents can
attack
