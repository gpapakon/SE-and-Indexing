<ABSTRACT>
An electrical connector assembly (10) is provided 
for terminating an insulated electrical wire (12). The 

assembly includes a housing having a wire-receiving opening 
(52) adapted to receive the insulated electrical wire. The 

housing is defined by two housing halves (26, 28) which are 
relatively movable between an open condition for insertion 

of an insulated wire into the opening and a closed 
condition. A terminal is mounted in the housing and has an 

insulation displacement slot (38) positioned in the opening 
and adapted to displace the insulation of the wire and 

electrically engage an inner conductor of the wire. 
Opposing flexible portions (54, 56) of the housing halves 

provide strain relief to the insulated electrical wire by 
gripping the wire substantially entirely thereabout when 

the housing halves are in their closed condition.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention generally relates to the art of
electrical connectors and, particularly, to a connector
which incorporates an insulation displacement terminal
means in conjunction with an improved strain relief means.There has been a wide variety of electrical
connectors or connector assemblies adapted for insulation-displacement
termination of an insulated electrical wire.
Such connectors sometimes are called "solderless"
connectors. In other words, a typical insulated wire
includes a center conductor (which may be solid or
stranded) surrounded by an insulating cladding or cover.
The connector includes some form of terminal means which
pierces through the insulation and establishes direct
electrical engagement with the interior conductive core.
A typical insulation displacement terminal includes an
insulation-piercing slot defined by cutting edges for
cutting through the insulation and further defining an
electrical contact area for engaging the conductive core of
the wire.The terminals of such insulation displacement
connectors most often are fabricated of stamped and formed
sheet metal material and typically the forming and
"cutting" requirements of the material necessitate that the
material be relatively thin. Therefore, it can be
understood that the electrical contact area (i.e. the edges
of the insulation-piercing slot which contact the 
conductive core) is relatively small, particular in
comparison to a crimped wire connection, for instance.
Accordingly, when such an insulation displacement
connection is used in applications where it is subject to
vibration or shock, the conductive core of the insulated
wire is prone to move, bend or deform due to a high level
of stress at the contact interface. In fact, continuous
bending of the conductive core can result in "work
hardening" of the metal conductor which, in turn, causes
brittleness and even breakage of the core, and eventual
electrical failure. Therefore, in such applications,
various forms of strain relief means have been provided for
the insulated electrical wire, usually supporting the
insulation at a location remote from the electrical contact
area or interface.Among prior attempts to provide strain relief for
the electrical wire, one approach is to provide an
insulation crimping section on the insulation displacement
terminal itself. In other words, one portion (such as a
slotted portion) of the terminal pierces the insulation of
the wire, and another portion of the terminal is crimped
onto the outer insulation of the wire spaced from the
ins

An electrical connector assembly (10) for
an insulated electrical wire, the connector

assembly including:

housing means (26, 28) having a wire-receiving opening
(52) therein for receiving the insulated electrical wire;

the housing means having two housing halves (26, 28);
a terminal (34) mounted in the housing means and having
an insulation displacement slot (38) adapted to displace the

insulation of the wire and electrically engage the inner
conductor to create 
an electrical connection therebetween;
integrally molded strain relief means (18) located
adjacent the connection within the wire-receiving opening

(52) of the housing means for surrounding and gripping the
insulated wire substantially entirely there-about,
wherein the wire-receiving opening extends entirely
through the housing means and said integrally molded strain

relief means are positioned on both sides of the terminal
within the opening adjacent the electrical connection to

provide support to the electrical insulated wire in two
locations longitudinally spaced along the wire on opposite

sides of the terminal,
whereby the strain relief means provide support to the
insulated electrical wire and strain relieves the inner

conductor

   characterized in that

   said strain relief means comprise complementary flexible
portions (54, 56) located on each of the housing halves 

allowing to accept different wire gauge and insulation
diameters.
The electrical connector assembly as set forth
in claim 1, wherein said housing means is defined by a pair

of dielectric housing halves (26, 28) which are relatively
movable between an open condition, for insertion of the

insulated wire thereinto, and a closed position, wherein the
housing halves are positively latched together, and wherein

the integrally molded strain relief means are operatively
associated between the housing halves and support the

insulated electrical wire when the housing halves are in
their closed position.
The electrical connector assembly as set forth
in claim 1 or 2, wherein said housing halves are molded of

plastic material, and including integrally molded hinge
means (30) between the housing halves to facilitate said

relative movement therebetween.
The electrical connector assembly as set
forth in claims 1, 2 or 3, wherein said two complementary

flexible portions (54, 56) are defined by a relatively thin
membrane in the shape of a semi-circle having a vertical

slot (58, 60) extending therethrough.
