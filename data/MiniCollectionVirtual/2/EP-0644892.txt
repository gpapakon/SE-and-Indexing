<DESCRIPTION>
 INHIBITORS OF ANGIOTENSIN I CHYMASEfS.INCLUDING HUMAN HEART CHYMASEBackground of the InventionThis invention relates to novel polypeptides. These compounds are useful for treatment of hypertension, congestive heart failure, cardiac hypertrophy including left ventricular hypertrophy, peripheral vascular complications, diabetic complications including renal disease, and other degenerative disorders mediated by angiotensin II.Certain chymases, a subfamily of serine proteases, including human heart chymase, human mast cell chymase, and human skin chymase (which if not all the same, are very closely related enzymes), have been found to cleave the naturally occurring decapeptide known as angiotensin I to the octapeptide known as angiotensin II, without substantially degrading angiotensin II. These enzymes are termed herein angiotensin I chymases.Angiotensin II is known to be a potent pressor substance, i.e. a substance that is capable of inducing a significant increase in blood pressure and is believed to act by causing the constriction of blood vessels and the release of the sodium-retaining hormone aldosterone from the adrenal gland. Angiotensin II is also produced from the decapeptide angiotensin I by the action of angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE). TheACE pathway is the target of a number of therapeutically useful antihypertensive agents.Therefore, angiotensin I chymases, including human heart chymase, provide an ACE-independent pathway for formation of angiotensin II, and are thus implicated as a causative factor in certain forms of hypertension and congestive heart failure. Angiotensin II is also implicated as a causative agent in other diseases or risk factors associated with hypertension, such as cardiac hypertrophy (enlargement of the heart), myocardial infarction, vascular hypertrophy (proliferation of vascular smooth muscle cells), diabetic and nondiabetic renal disease (caused in part by hypertension in the kidney), and restenosis or vascular damage in blood vessels of patients suffering from aetheroma treated with angioplasty techniques or thrombolytics. It is a current goal of antihypertensive therapy to treat or prevent such damage to organs or vessels in addition to lowering blood pressure. Angiotensin I chymases, including human heart chymase, are thereby implicated as causative factors in the above-named degenerative disorders in addition to hypertension and congestive heart failure.
