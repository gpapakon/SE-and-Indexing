<ABSTRACT>
Microbial biomass cells wherein at least one metal cationic species is attached to the surface of said cells in an amount sufficient to render the said cells effective to bind anions thereto, and wherein at least one anionic species is also bound to the surface of said cells. The invention also provides a method of making microbial biomass cells as claimed in any preceding claims which comprises: providing biomass cells within a culture medium, removing said cells from said medium and washing them, suspending the cells in a buffer medium, adding a quantity of the required cationic species in aqueous solution optionally to saturation of the binding sites therefor on the cell wall, adding a quantity of the required anionic species in aqueous solution optionally to saturation of the binding sites therefor on the cell wall, removing the treated biomass and washing, and drying the cells to form a solid product. A digestible, mineral-containing composition is also provided which contains biomass cells. For environmental clean-up applications there is also provided a method of reducing the concentration of at least one anionic species in an aqueous composition containing said species, which comprises bringing said aqueous composition into intimate contact with microbial biomass cells, to which at least one metal cationic species has been bound in a quantity sufficient to render said biomass cells receptive to bind said at least one anionic species, and optionally causing the said biomass cells to become regenerated with the same or different metal cationic species after anionic species have become bound to said biomass.

<DESCRIPTION>
Certain microbial species have commercial
application as a source of fine chemicals, lipids,
polysaccharides and single cell protein. Microbial cell
surfaces are negatively charged and therefore have a low
affinity for anions, except at sites specifically designed
for uptake of essential anions.The cyanobacterium Spirulina platensis is well
known in the health food market, being a non-toxic bacterium
with intrinsic nutritional value. Its protein content is
some 50-70% of dry-weight and its amino acid composition is
well balanced. Its lipid content is of the order of 11% of
dry weight whilst its vitamin B12 content is probably the
highest of any unprocessed plant or animal food. Because of
the lack of cellulose in the Spirulina cell wall, it is
readily assimilated by humans. In some parts of the World,
Spirulina is a natural foodstuff.Research in the pharmaceutical and health food
industries demonstrates that mineral deficiencies in the
diet can be alleviated by ingesting minerals contained
within, e.g. mineral tablets or in physical admixture or
combination with a carrier foodstuff. In the case of
soluble chemical compounds containing the required mineral,
digestion or assimilation may be too rapid for the body to
absorb beneficial quantities.Two such metallic or metalloid minerals, which are
important and have been implicated in mineral deficiency are
zinc and selenium. These elements, at least in the form of
ions in solution play an important role in metabolism and
general good health. Whilst there is a need generally to
ensure an adequate level of bioavailable zinc and selenium
in the human diet, there have been problems in
incorporating, for example, zinc and selenium minerals
within supplements for foodstuffs.Spirulina biomass, for example, contains low 
concentrations of metals taken up from the nutrient solution
in which the cells were grown. Samples of Spirulina after
combustion and ashing showed 10% metals of the total dry
weight. Magnesium (in chlorophyll), potassium and sodium
were generally always present.Previous but unsuccessful attempts have been made
to introduce metals into Spirulina on a commercial scale to
supplement the amounts of metals taken up naturally.The present inventors have now discovered that a
range of nutritionally essential or desirable metal cations
can be attached to the cell wall of microbial biomass and
thereafter selected anions can be attached which either
render the treated biomass suitable for the production of
mineral supplements where the anionic species are
