<ABSTRACT>
An incinerator for combustible or thermally-decomposable gases includes 
a device which insures that gas continues to flow through the incinerator 

in the event of failure of the scrubber fan (47) connected to 
the outlet (73) of the incinerator. When the scrubber fan fails, a 

solenoid-operated valve (53) opens, and compressed gas from a tank (57) 
flows through the valve into the main conduit (71) of the incinerator. 

The compressed gas enters the main conduit through an air flow amplifier 
(41) installed within the main conduit (71). The air flow amplifier magnifies 

the effect of the compressed gas, and creates a region of negative 
pressure which assures that toxic or hazardous gases do not remain in the 

incinerator, but instead continue to flow toward the scrubber fan (47), 
even after the fan has failed.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to the field of incinerators. The invention 
is especially intended for incinerating hazardous gases, such as silane, 
which are vented from semiconductor manufacturing equipment. Silane gas is a byproduct of the semiconductor manufacturing process. 
In the latter process, silane gas is generally made to flow, at or 
near atmospheric pressure, over silicon wafers for reaction with the 
silicon. Silane leaving the region of the wafers constitutes a safety 
hazard because it can ignite spontaneously upon contact with air. U.S. Patent No. 4,661,056 discloses an incinerator specifically intended 
for use in burning silane gas or other gases. This specification 
hereby incorporates by reference the disclosure of the latter patent. 
The incinerator described in the latter patent has a first pipe and a 
second pipe, the pipes being mutually perpendicular, and being welded or 
otherwise bonded to each other. A central section of the exterior wall 
of the first pipe is open to the second pipe, so that the two pipes are 
in fluid communication with each other. The first pipe also has an open 
end, into which air (or some other gas which supports combustion) flows. 
Silane gas (or some other gas which is to be combusted) enters the system 
through the second pipe. In order to assure uniformity of the semiconductor manufacturing 
process, the silane gas is conveyed through the semiconductor manufacturing 
apparatus at low pressure. Thus, the silane gas entering the second 
pipe is still at low pressure. The air entering through the first pipe  
 
strikes a side wall of the second pipe, and establishes a turbulent, centrifugal 
swirling action which causes the air to mix with the silane, and 
to break oxide bubbles which may have formed around the silane. The 
swirling action promotes complete combustion of the silane gas. The air 
also provides a cooling medium for the gaseous products of combustion. A spark plug provides additional control over the incineration 
process. The incinerated gases pass through the remainder of the first 
pipe, and enter a scrubber. A fan draws the gases out of the first pipe 
and towards the scrubber. The apparatus described above has the following potential safety 
problem. If the scrubber fan fails, the air movement through the incinerator 
is reduced, and there is a risk that the toxic gases still in 
the incinerator may escape through its open end. One possible solution 
to this problem is to provide backup power for the scrubber fan, and to 
connect the

An incinerator for combustible or thermally-decomposable gas, 
the incinerator comprising a first pipe (1) having open entrance and exit 

portions and an inlet opening disposed between the entrance and exit portions, 
a second pipe (3) having first and second ends, the first end 

being fixed about said inlet to provide fluid communication between the 
pipes, the second end being substantially closed to an outside environment, 

ignition means (9) disposed within the second pipe, means (7) for 
conveying at least one combustible gas into the second pipe, and means 

for turbulently conveying a stream of a gas capable of supporting combustion 
into the entrance end of the first pipe, and for centrifugally 

swirling said turbulently flowing gas into and out of the second pipe and 
for discharging said turbulently flowing gas through the exit end of the 

first pipe, the exit end of the first pipe being connected to a conduit 
(45) ha
ving means (47) for drawing gas through the first pipe, 
   characterized in that the incincerator includes a source (57) of 

compressed gas, and means (41) for introducing compressed gas from the 
source into said first pipe, wherein the compressed gas comprises means 

for propelling gases through the first pipe (1) in the event said gas-drawing 
means (47) becomes inoperative. 
The incinerator of Claim 1, characterized in that the gas-drawing 
means is a scrubber fan (47) located in a duct (45) which is in fluid 

communication with the first pipe (1). 
The incinerator of Claim 2, characterized in that the scrubber 
fan is operatively connected to a valve (53), the valve providing a fluid 

flow path between a source (57) of compressed gas and the introducing 
 

means (41). 
The incinerator of any one of Claims 1-3, characterized in that 
the introducing means comprises an air flow amplifier (41), the air flow 

amplifier having means defining an annular chamber (77) into which the 
compressed gas flows, the annular chamber having an opening which allows 

compressed gas to flow from the chamber into the first pipe (1). 
A method of removing toxic gases from an incinerator in the 
event of failure of a scrubber fan (47), the scrubber fan being provided 

to draw gases out of the incinerator and into an outlet duct (45), the 
method being characterized by the steps of: 


a) detecting an interruption of electric power to the scrubber fan

b) switching a position of a valve (53) upon detection of interruption 
of power to the scrubber fan, the valve being connected between a 

source (57) of compressed gas and a main pipe (1) of the incinerator, and 
c) allowing the compressed gas to flow into the main pipe (1), 
through an annular chamber (77), so as to cause gases in the incinerator 

to be drawn into the outlet duct (45) even after the scrubber fan (47) is 
no longer operating.
