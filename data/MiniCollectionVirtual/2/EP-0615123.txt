<ABSTRACT>
A method and an apparatus for surface analysis suitable for qualitative and quantitative analyses of residue on the surface 
of a specimen by irradiating the surface of the specimen with a sharply focused electro
n beam and detecting fluorescent X-rays 
radiated from the surface of the specimen. The electron beam (1) is projected into a fine hole (h) in the surface of the specimen (2) 

through an aperture (9) which is provided at the center of an X-ray detector (8). Fluorescent X-rays (5) which are radiated from 
the fine hole (h) due to the irradiation with the electron beam (1) are detected in the paraxial direction of the electron beam (1) 

(desirably, within 20 degrees to the axis of the electron beam) by the annular X-ray detector (8) having an energy analysis function. 
With the adoption of such a structure, fluorescent X-rays (5) from the fine hole (h) are able to reach the X-ray detector (8) 

without being absorbed by the substance of the specimen. Therefore, it is possible to analyze the residue in the fine hole both 
qualitatively and quantitatively with a high precision even when its aspect ratio is high. Since this method is non-destructive, it is 

possible to return the specimen to the process of the manufacture after the analysis.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an improved surface
analysis technique. More particularly, the invention
relates to a surface analysis method for addressing the
qualitative and quantitative analysis of residues remaining
on the surface of samples to be analyzed, and to an
apparatus for carrying out the same method.To scale down the size of semiconductor devices
requires establishing a viable fabrication technique for
dealing with the levels of dimensions below deep
submicrons. For example, the production of 256-Mb DRAM's
necessitates fabricating contact holes as small as 0.2 µm
in diameter and 2 µm in depth. To establish the
fabrication technique of this magnitude of precision
requires providing techniques for evaluating the precision
of what is fabricated. Of such evaluation techniques, what
is particularly in demand is one for analyzing
qualitatively and quantitatively any residues that remain 
on the surface of wafers after dry etching. In analyzing
such residues, it should be noted that the wafer surface is
not necessarily flat; areas with large ups and downs
symbolized by the contact holes above also need to be
analyzed.Heretofore, the analysis of residues over appreciably
undulating areas has been generally carried out by cutting
the fabricated wafer and by observing the cross section
thereof using a scanning electron microscope (SEM). This
method has a number of disadvantages. One disadvantage of
the method is that it is simply for observing the shape of
the residues and not for identifying them. Another
disadvantage is that, the observed wafer cannot be returned
whole into the fabrication process. A further disadvantage
is that the conventional method is not fit for observing
residues on the order of several nanometers. When the
development of Gb-order semiconductor integrated circuit
devices is concerned, the above-mentioned disadvantages are
critical in that they can significantly degrade yield and
analysis accuracy.One conventional method that bypasses the need to cut
the wafer for observation is the so-called fluorescence X-ray
analysis. Japanese Patent Laid-Open No. 243855/1988
discloses an example of this method in the form of an
analyzing apparatus using charged particles. The disclosed 
apparatus irradiates an electron beam to a sample and
observes fluorescence X-rays emitted therefrom. The
observation of fluorescence X-rays involves the use of
crystals arranged at 22 degrees with respect to the center
axis of the electron beam irradiated.In analyzing residues qualitatively and
