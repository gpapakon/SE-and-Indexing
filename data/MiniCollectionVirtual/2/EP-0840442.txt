<ABSTRACT>
The circuit of a two-stage fully differential amplifier composed of a 
differential input stage, two output stages and a common mode 

feedback circuit coupled to the output nodes of the amplifier includes a 
non-inverting stage coupled to a respective output node of the 

differential input stage for driving the respective output stage. Each 
auxiliary non-inverting stage of the two branches of the fully differential 

amplifier uses as a biasing current generator, the load device of the 
branch of the differential input stage to the output of which the non-inverting 

stage is coupled. The modified circuit of the fully differential 
amplifier permits the use of a null-consumption common mode feedback 

circuit as normally employed in a single stage fully differential amplifier.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to integrated circuits and more in 
particular to a fully differential operational amplifier circuit ,that is, 
having a differential output Operational amplifiers are real building blocks and as such they are 
widely used in analog signal processing systems. In many applications it is convenient to use a fully differential 
operational amplifier, that is to say, having a differential output. As it is well known by an expert in the art, a fully differential operational 
amplifier requires a common mode feedback circuit in order to operate 
properly. The document "Analog Circuit Synthesis for large, realistic 
cells: designing a pipelined A/D converter with ASTRX/OBLX" by 
E.S. OCHOTTA ET AL., IEEE 1994 custom integrated circuit conference, 01-05-94 
pages 365-368, discloses a two-stage fully differential amplifier with a 
common mode feedback circuit. The article "A family of Differential NMOS Analog Circuit for PCM Code 
Filter Chip, IEEE JSSC, Dec. 1982 is a review of this type of circuits. In substance, as it is shown in Figure 1, a fully differential amplifier 
amplifies a differential input signal (Vid) providing for differential output 
signal (Vod), and is provided with an auxiliary input (INCM), through 
which control of the common mode at the outputs nodes (Vcm) is 
exerted in order to position it exactly half-way between the voltages of 
the supply rails (VDD and VSS). In single-stage fully differential amplifiers, the common mode feedback 
circuit may be considered extremely efficient as it does not imply any 
current consumption. As indicated in a simplified manner in Figure 2, VR and VB are two 
reference voltages, which can respectively be equal to about (VDD+ VSS)/2 
and VGSm3. On the other hand, in those applications where it is essential to ensure 
the maximum output voltage swing (ideally equal to the supply voltage),  
 
like for instance in systems destined to function at low and extremely 
low supply voltage, it becomes necessary to employ two-stage at least, 
fully differential amplifiers. In these cases, the common mode feedback circuit cannot be realized 
as for a single-stage amplifier, according to the scheme shown in Figure 
2, because two inversions would occur between the feedback node 
INCM and the output nodes, resulting in a positive feedback that would 
make the system unstable. Up until now, the approach for realizing a common mode control loop in 
a two-stage amplifier has been that of adding an inverting stage to the 
feedback circuit of
