<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a process for starting up a fluid 
bed or spouted bed reactor process for preparing synthesis gas, carbon 
monoxide and hydrogen, from lower alkanes, preferably methane, in the 
presence of a suitable steam reforming catalyst. More particularly, 
this invention relates to starting up a process for reacting a lower 
alkane, e.g., methane, with oxygen in the presence of other gas phase 
components, preferably steam and carbon dioxide, at elevated temperatures 
and pressures, and substantially reducing the tendency of the 
catalytic materials to agglomerate. In fluid bed processes the entire solids inventory is in a 
state of fluidization, while in spouted bed processes only that 
portion of bed through which the gases are injected are in a fluidized 
state. The production of synthesis gas by either partial oxidation 
or steam-reforming is well known and there are extensive literature 
references to these processes. The processes may be used separately 
or they may be combined. Thus, the steam-reforming reaction is highly 
endothermic and is described as: 
CH₄ + H₂O → CO + 3H₂ 
while the partial oxidation reaction is highly exothermic and is 
described by: 
CH₄ + O₂ → CO + H₂ + H₂OThe combined reaction employing a 2/1 CH₄/O₂ feed ratio is 
described as:  
 
2 CH₄ + O₂ → 2CO + 4H₂In addition to these reactions, the mildly exothermic water 
gas shift reaction also occurs: 
CO + H₂O → H₂ + CO₂The representation of the combined process shows that the 
ratio of produced hydrogen to carbon monoxide is 2/1, the approximate 
stoichiometric hydrogen/carbon monoxide ratio for producing higher 
hydrocarbons by a hydrocarbon synthesis process, such as the Fischer-Tropsch 
process over a catalyst with little or no water gas shift 
activity. A number of patents illustrate these processes, and U.S. 
Patent No. 4,888,131 contains an extensive, but not exhaustive listing 
thereof. Fluid bed processes are well known for the advantages they 
provide in heat and mass transfer characteristics. Such processes 
allow for substantially isothermal reactor conditions, and are usually 
effective in eliminating temperature runaways or hot spots; however, 
with O₂ injection complete elimination of hot spots is impossible 
although the fluid bed does tend to minimize the intensity. They are 
not, however, without their disadvantages: catalyst strength or 
attrition resistance is important for maintaining the integrity of the 
catalyst and minimizing the formation of fine particles that may be 
lost from the

<CLAIMS>
A method for starting up a fluidized bed or spouted bed 
steam reforming-partial oxidation process for converting a feed gas 

comprising methane to a product comprising hydrogen and carbon 
monoxide and unconverted methane which comprises the sequential steps 

of: 

(a) heating to reaction temperature the fluidized bed or 
spouted bed comprised of essentially inert particles, in the presence 

of oxygen, in an oxiding atmosphere, and in the substantial absence of 
a reforming catalyst; 
(b) converting to a reducing atmosphere; and 
(c) introducing into the fluidized bed or spouted bed 
sufficient Group VIII metal containing catalyst and converting, in the 

presence of oxygen, the feed gas to the product. 
The method of claim 1 wherein the unconverted methane in 
step (a) is less than about 12 vol%. 
The method of claim 1 or claim 2 wherein the oxidizing atmosphere 
is maintained for no more than about 8 hours. 
The method of any one of claims 1 to 3 wherein the reaction temperature 
is at least about 1650°F (898.9°C). 
The method of any one of claims 1 to 4 wherein steam is present at least 
in step (c). 
The method of any one of claims 1 to 5 wherein steam is present in steps 
(a), (b), and (c). 
The method of any one of claims 1 to 6 wherein the reaction temperature 
ranges from 1650°-2000°F (898.9 to 1093.3°C) and the pressure ranges from 20-40 atmospheres 

(20.27 to 40.55 bar).  
 
The method of any one of claims 1 to 7 wherein the heating of the bed is 
effected by combusting a gas comprising methane with oxygen in an 

amount greater than the stoichiometric amount required for complete 
combustion of the gas. 
The method of any one of claims 1 to 8 wherein the Group VIII metal is 
nickel. 
The method of claim 9 wherein the catalyst is a supported 
nickel and the nickel concentration is at least about 1 wt%. 
The method of any one of claims 1 to 10 wherein the bed is a fluidized 
bed.
