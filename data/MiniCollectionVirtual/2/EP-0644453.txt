<ABSTRACT>
Organic nonlinear optical materials that have light 
absorption in the crystal at wavelengths shorter than 390 nm, 

that have good crystallinity and processability, that have a 
non-centrosymmetry molecular arrangement and that hence are 

suitable for use in wavelength conversion devices comprises 
compounds having the formula I: 


where
 

   R¹, R² and R³ which may be the same or different represent 
a hydrogen atom, an alkyl group, an aryl group or a heterocyclic 

group;
 

   R⁴ is a hydrogen atom, an alkyl group, an aryl group, a 
heterocyclic group or an electron withdrawing group;

 
   R⁵ which may be the same or different represent a hydrogen 

atom, an alkyl group, an aryl group, a heterocyclic group or an 
electron donating group;

 
   m is an integer of 1 to 4;

 
   when m is 2 or more, two or more R⁵s may bind together to 

form a ring;

R⁵ are all hydrogen atoms.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to organic nonlinear optical 
materials useful as nonlinear optical materials. Nonlinear optical materials are today drawing increasing 
attention in the field of opto-electronics. Nonlinear optical 
materials are those materials which interact with light to 
exhibit a nonlinear optical response. Second-order nonlinear 
optical effects are exemplified by second harmonic generation 
(SHG) and the first-order electro-optical (EO) effect (Pockel's 
effect). The materials exhibiting these effects can be utilized 
in various devices such as frequency doubling of the laser 
light, electro-optical modulation and electro-optical switching. 
Continuative efforts, therefore, are being made to study 
nonlinear optical devices exhibiting these effects. Nonlinear optical materials conventionally known to exhibit 
the SHG effects are inorganic substances such as lithium niobate 
(LiNbO₃) and potassium titanate phosphate (KTP). The studies 
heretofore made on wavelength conversion devices utilizing the 
SHG effect have also focused on these inorganic substances. In 
recent years, however, organic nonlinear optical materials 
having a conjugated π-electron system have drawn the increasing 
attention because of their large optical nonlinearity and fast 
optical response, and many studies are being conducted in a 
search for promising materials. Conventionally known organic nonlinear optical materials 
include urea, 2-methyl-4-nitroaniline (MNA), m-nitroaniline,  
 
N,N-dimethyl-2-acetylamino-4-nitroaniline (DAN), 3-methyl-4-nitropyridine-N-oxide 
(POM) and N-(4-nitrophenyl)-(L)-prolinol 
(NPP). Details about organic nonlinear optical materials may be 
found in, for example, 
(1) "Nonlinear Optical Properties of Organic and Polymeric 
Materials", ed. David J. Williams, ACS Symposium Series No. 233 
(1983); (2) "Nonlinear Optical Properties of Organic Molecules and 
Crystals", Vols. 1 and 2, ed. D.S. Chemla and J. Zyss, 
Academic Press (1987); (3) "Yuki Hisenkei Kogaku Zairyo (Organic Nonlinear Optical 
Materials)", Masao Kato and Hachiro Nakanishi, CMC Press (1985); 
and (4) "Shin-Yuki Hisenkei Kogaku Zairyo (Advanced Nonlinear 
Optical Organic Materials)" Vols. I and II, T. Kobayashi, M. 
Umegaki, H. Nakanishi and N. Nakamura, CMC Press (1991). An issue with the organic compound synthesized by this 
molecular designing technique is the increment of its dipole 
moment due to the intramolecular charge transfer interaction. 
Hence, owing to the dipole-dipole interaction, this organic 
compound tends
