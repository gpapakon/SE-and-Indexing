<DESCRIPTION>
 CHEMICALLY TREATED GLASS FIBERS FOR REINFORCING POLYMERIC MATERIALSThe present application is directed to glass fibers treated with an aqueous chemical treating composition, said fibers being ideal for use in reinforcing thermosetting polymeric matrices for improving the composite strength thereof. The reinforced plastic industry has been using glass fibers in various forms for reinforcing polymeric matrices to produce myriad products. For instance, glass fibers have been used in the form of continuous and chopped filaments and strands and rovings and woven and nonwoven fabrics to reinforce polymers. For example, thermosetting polymeric matrices have been reinforced with the various forms of glass fibers in producing such products as sheet molding compounds, bulk molding compounds, pultrusion products, panel products, spray up molding products and the like molding products.In producing glass fibers for the polymeric reinforcement market, the glass fibers are attenuated from molten streams of fiberizable glass material from a bushing or a like device connected to a furnace containing molten fiberizable glass material. The glass fibers are attenuated by a winder, which collects gathered filaments into a package, or by rollers, which pull the fibers before they are collected and chopped. In the process of producing glass fibers, a chemical treating composition is applied to them shortly after they are attenuated as the molten streams of glass. The chemical treating composition is usually an aqueous composition traditionally containing film forming materials, coupling agents and lubricants. The chemical treating composition is needed to retard inter filament abrasion of the glass fibers when they are gathered into a bundle of glass fibers or strands and to make the glass fibers compatible with polymer matrices that they are to reinforce. Typically, the chemically treated glass fibers are dried either in the package form or in the 

 chopped strand form before they are used for reinforcing polymeric matrices.Glass fiber reinforced polymer matrices, such as pultruded profiles and/or clear or translucent panels, are commonly used outdoors or in corrosive environments. Applications of pultruded composites include ladder rails, sucker rods, antennas, railings, conduits, I-beams, H-beams and angles. Clear or translucent reinforced plastic panel applications include solar collectors, sky lights, artificial light fixture covers, patio covers, highway signs and markings, green house glazings and the like.Problems

STATEMENTUNDER ARΗCLE 19
Also enclosed are replacement pages 24, 25, 26, 27, 28 and 29 in which amendments to the claims are made and new pages 30, 31 and 32 to provide the new claim. The difference between the claims as filed and the claims as amended are as follows:
1. Claims 1, 2, 6, 8, 11, 14, 15, 16 and 17 have been amended.
2. New claim 25 has been added.
The amendment to claim 1 is to remove the diallyl phthalate from the claim and to refer to the amount of allylic compound needed for interfacial interaction between the treated glass fibers and thermosetting matrix polymers in order to distinguish the allylic compounds of the instant invention as being latently reactive. The amendment to claim 2 is to delete the term "chemical treating composition" so that it only appears in claim 1.
Claim 6 has been amended to allow the use of either the polyamino amide or wax or a combination thereof as a lubricant.
Claims 8 and 14 are written in independent form including all of the limitations of the base claim and any intervening claims from which they depend.
The amendment to claim 11 is to correct typographical errors.
The amendment to claim 15 is to clarify the term "chemical treating composition" and to make the claim from which it depends more apparent.
The amendment to claims 16 and 17 provides a proper antecedent basis for the terms "glass fibers" and "chemical treating composition" by changing the claim they are dependent upon.
Claim 25 is added in order to more completely cover Applicant's invention.
Enclosed is a new "Abstract" page, which is renumbered page 33.
