<ABSTRACT>
Apparatus for inserting a catheter into a selected vein and to a selected position within such vein comprises a tubular sheath (20) mountable in surrounding relation to a percutaneous needle (30) to permit the distal end of the tubular sheath to enter the vein penetrated by the needle (30). The tubular sheath (10) is rigidly bonded in the bore (20a) of a hub portion (20) of an operating element and has a pair of diametrically opposed, longitudinal score lines (10a). The hub element (20) is longitudinally divided by longitudinal slots (21) aligned with the sheath score lines (10a) except for two thin walled integral connecting sections (20c) having score lines (20d) aligned with the sheath score lines (10a). A pair of diametrically opposed, manually graspable wing portions (22) are integrally formed on the hub element (20) intermediate the hub score lines (20d) to permit the longitudinal severance of the hub element (20) and sheath (10) to remove same from a catheter (40) transversing the bores of the hub element (20) and sheath (10) to enter the selected vein after the needle (30) is removed.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to an apparatus for inserting
a small diameter catheter an extended distance into small
human veins, and particularly an emplacement apparatus that
may be axially split for removal from the catheter after
the catheter is properly positioned in the vein.As shown in U.S. Patent No. 4,306,562 to Osborne, it
is desirable to provide a catheter emplacement or
introduction apparatus which will permit the catheter to
be moved an extended distance through a vein of the patient
to a location adjacent a particular organ. Such insertion
must be accomplished without danger of rupturing the vein,
other than by piercing the vein by a percutaneous needle.
The catheter emplacement device preferably includes a
elongated tubular sheath or introducer which is mounted
over the needle and moveable axially relative to the needle
after vein penetration has been accomplished to position
the distal end of the sheath within the desired vein. The
needle may then be withdrawn and the distal end of the
catheter inserted through the sheath and into the vein and
moved the desired distance through the vein to a desired
location.At the point, it is very desirable to effect the
removal of the sheath from the body to minimize the
possibility of infection or other adverse reaction of the
body tissue to the presence of the sheath. A small
diameter catheter may, however, remain in place in the vein
for an extended period. To remove the catheter guide or
sheath, the aforementioned Osborne patent proposes that the
sheath be made of longitudinally molecularly oriented
material and provides slits in the proximal ends of the 
sheath which permit the proximal ends to be grasped and a
severing force applied to the axially severable material
of the sheath. A similar technique has been employed for
the insertion of pacemaker electrodes. See U.S. Patent
No. 4,166,469 to Littleford.Such prior art devices have, however, two
disadvantages, particularly when a very small diameter
catheter must be employed, such as would be used in the
veins of neonatal patients. It is understood that small
diameter catheters generally have an external diameter of
less than 2.54 x 10-3 metres (0.1 inches). To introduce
this small end of a very flexible element into the equally
small bore of the catheter guide or sheath requires a fair
amount of manual dexterity on the part of the medical
technician to insert the catheter, particularly with blood
flowing out of the bore. Additionally, there is a problem
that once the catheter is inserted, the removal

<CLAIMS>
Apparatus (1) for inserting catheters (40) an extended
distance into a selected human vein comprising, in

combination:

a tubular plastic sheath (10) having an external
diameter small enough to be readily insertable in a

selected vein and an internal diameter sufficiently large
to permit a desired diameter of catheter to be readily

passed through the bore of said sheath;
a percutaneous needle (30) insertable through said
bore of said sheath to an extent that the sharpened end

(32) of said needle projects out of the distal end of said
sheath, whereby penetration of a selected vein by said

needle permits said sheath to be moved forwardly relative
to said needle to enter the selected vein;
said sheath having a pair of diametrically opposed
longitudinally extending score lines (10a) whereby the

application of opposed radial forces to an end of said
sheath at locations intermediate said score lines will

produce a longitudinal splitting of said tubular sheath;
an operating member for said sheath formed from molded
plastic material;
said operating member comprising a central hub portion
(20) having a bore rigidly bonded to the proximal end of

said sheath and two diametrically opposed, radially
projecting, manually graspable wing portions (22)

positioned intermediate said score lines in said sheath;
said central hub portion having longitudinal slots
(21) respectively disposed in alignment with said score

lines in said sheath essentially dividing said hub portion
except for a pair of integral, diametrically opposed, thin-walled

connecting webs (20c) located at the proximal end
of said hub; and
a pair of longitudinal score lines (20d) formed in
said connecting webs and respectively aligned with said

score lines in said sheath, whereby the application of
opposing radial forces to said wing portions effects the 

shearing of said hub and said sheath along their respective
longitudinal score lines to permit the removal of said

catheter insertion apparatus from a catheter traversing the
bore of said sheath and said central hub portion to enter

the selected vein to any desired distance when said needle
is removed from the bore of said sheath and said central

hub portion, wherein
said central hub portion defines a conical recess
(20b) communicating with the proximal end of said hub bore,

thereby facilitating entry of the catheter into said sheath
bore.
An apparatus as claimed in claim 1, wherein said
sheath has an internal diameter on the order of 2.54 x 10
-3

metres (0.10 inches).
An apparatus as claimed in claim 2, wherein said
connecting webs constitute conical segments.
