<DESCRIPTION>
 POWER SUPPLYFielfl Qt Tfte invent i<?Ï„\This invention relates generally to power supplies, and more particularly to solid-state power supplies that are particularly adapted for driving ozone generators.Background Of The InventionOne of the most efficient ways for generating ozone, Oj, is to subject oxygen, 02, or a gas containing a high concentration of oxygen to a corona discharge. Thus, for example, ozone may be generated by passing oxygen through an annular gap between a glass tube and a grounded outer electrode and applying a cyclic high voltage to an inner electrode embedded in the glass tube. Ozone is typically generated during portions of cycles occurring just prior to a peak. Therefore, more ozone can be produced by increasing the frequency of this cyclic voltage, but a point is reached when the power dissipated in the annular gap tends to break the ozone molecules 03 down into oxygen molecules 02.Circuits for generating the drive voltage for ozonators have used auto transformers or saturable reactors, both of which are bulky, heavy and inefficient. Furthermore, it is desirable to be able to control the rate of production of ozone from 0% to 

 100% of the capacity of the ozone generator by controlling the drive voltage. This is impracticable to achieve with circuits using saturable reactors. In addition, an ozonator presents a capacitive load to the drive voltage supply so that the sizes of the step-up transformer and inductive control components of the supply are much larger than would be required if the power factor were unity.In a U.S. patent application entitled "Power Supply" that was filed on October 23, 1991 by the present inventors of this application, under Serial No. 07/781,793, the drive voltage cycles supplied to the ozonator is asymmetric so that its slope during an increase in voltage to a maximum value was less than the slope during a decrease in voltage from the maximum value to zero. Since, as previously noted, ozone is produced while the drive voltage is increasing from some predetermined value to its maximum value, ozone is produced during a greater portion of each cycle than would be the case if the drive voltage half cycles were symmetrical. Control of the rate at which ozone is produced in this system is achieved by varying the duration of the lower slopes of the cycles. Operation at near unity power factor is achieved by including an inductor in the circuit that resonates with the capacitance of the ozonator at a frequency that is just below the frequency of the drive
