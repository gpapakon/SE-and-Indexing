<ABSTRACT>
A liquid medicine containing capsaicin in solution as active ingredient for the treatment of chronic rhinopathy is described. The active ingredient solution is a neutral, aqueous solution with a very low active ingredient concentration. Whereas capsaicin has hitherto regularly been applied by the physician, after preceding local anaesthesia, in highly concentrated form to the nasal mucosa, the composition according to the invention can be applied, in particular in the form of a nasal spray, by the patients themselves. The therapeutic efficacy is nevertheless surprisingly high and sufficient.
