<ABSTRACT>
A thermal reaction chamber (30) for semiconductor wafer 
processing operations comprising: 


(i) a susceptor (36) for supporting a semiconductor wafer 
(38) within the chamber (32) and having a plurality 

of apertures (70) formed vertically therethrough; 
(ii) displacer means (35) for displacing the susceptor 
(36) vertically between at least a first and a second 

position; 
(iii) a plurality of wafer support elements (66), each of 
which is suspended to be vertically moveable within 

said apertures (70) and each of which extends beyond 
the underside of the susceptor (36); and 
(iv) means (64) for restricting the downward movement of 
the wafer support elements (66). As the susceptor is 

displaced from its first position through an 
intermediate position before the second position, the 

means (64) for restricting operate to stop the 
continued downward movement of the wafer support 

elements (66) thereby causing the elements to move 
vertically upwards with respect to the downwardly 

moving susceptor (36) and separate the wafer (38) 
from the susceptor (36).

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to thermal reactors
used in semiconductor wafer processing operations.Semiconductor wafers are usually processed in a thermal
reactor. To accomplish this, the wafer is inserted into the
reactor, by means of a robot arm, and placed to rest on a
graphite susceptor. The wafer is then processed and, once the
processing operation is completed, the robot arm removes the
wafer from the susceptor and reactor.Reference is made to EP-A-0 250 064 disclosing a thermal
reactor with lifting pins through the susceptor.The manner in which the wafer has been transferred to and
from the susceptor in the past is illustrated in Fig. 1. This
figure is a schematic cross-section through a portion of a
semiconductor thermal reactor 10 with a wafer 12 shown to be
resting on a susceptor 14. The apparatus shown in Fig. 1
represents an earlier device developed by Applicant
not made available to the public.
For
purposes of clarity, the lower portion of the thermal reactor
10, the susceptor drive mechanism and the dome-shaped upper
quartz window are not shown.To initiate the wafer transfer operation, the susceptor 14
moves downwards, in a two-step process. During the first of
these steps, the susceptor 14, together with a wafer support
cradle 16 which is located below the susceptor, move down to a
lower position represented by the cradle shown in broken lines
16'. Then, during the second of these steps and with the
cradle 16 remaining stationary, the susceptor moves further
down to a lower position 14', also represented in broken lines.
As a result, wafer support pins 18, which are located in holes
20 formed through the susceptor 14, move through the susceptor
and 
support the wafer 12 at a position 12'. This position 12' is
some distance above the susceptor's lower position 14' but still
below the position of the wafer before the transfer operation
was commenced. The space betweens the wafer 12 and the
susceptor 14 in this lowered configuration is sufficient to
allow a robot arm (not illustrated) to access the chamber and
move into position below the wafer.Thereafter, both the susceptor 14 and the cradle 16 are
together moved further down until the wafer 12 is supported
entirely by the robot arm and clear of the wafer support pins 18
whereupon the robot arm removes the wafer from the thermal
reactor 10.To ensure uniform heating and distribution of reactant
gases across the surface of the wafer 12, the susceptor 14 is
rotated during the processing operation. Unfortunately, certain
problems are associated with

<CLAIMS>
A thermal reactor (30) for semiconductor wafer
processing operations comprising:


(i) a susceptor (36) for supporting a semiconductor wafer
(38) within the chamber (32) and having a plurality of

apertures (80,82) formed vertically therethrough;
(ii) displacer means (35) for displacing the susceptor (36)
vertically between at least a first and a second

position,
(iii) a plurality of wafer support elements (66), each of
which is suspended to be vertically moveable within

said apertures (80,82) and each of which extends beyond
the underside of the susceptor (36); and
(iv) means (64) for restricting the downward movement of the
wafer support elements (66) whereby, as the susceptor

(36) is displaced from its first position through an
intermediate position before the second position, the

means (64) for restricting operate to stop the
continued downward movement of the wafer support

elements (66) thereby causing the elements (66) to move
vertically upwards with respect to the downwardly

moving susceptor (36) and separate the wafer (38) from
the susceptor (36);
each said wafer support element (66) being constituted

by a pin having an enlarged head (72) and a body,
wherein the head (72) is, in the first position of the 

susceptor, located in an enlarged portion (74) of its
respective aperture and the body of the pin is

suspended below said enlarged portion; and
wherein the head (72) of each pin is frusto-conical in
shape and the enlarged portion (74) of the aperture is

complementary shaped, such that, when the pin is
suspended from the susceptor (36), the frusto-conical

head (72) seals against the interior of the enlarged
portion of the aperture and substantially prevents the

movement of semiconductor wafer processing gases
through the apertures (80,82).
A thermal reactor as recited in claim 1 further comprising
means (34) for imparting rotary motion to the susceptor

(36).
A thermal reactor as recited in any one of the preceding
claims, wherein the means (64) for restricting the downward

movement includes a wafer support cradle (58) positioned
below the susceptor (36) whereby, when the susceptor (36)

is in its first position, the wafer support elements (64)
are suspended clear of the cradle (58) and as the susceptor

(36) moves through the intermediate position the wafer
support elements (66) are engaged by the cradle (58) and

prevented from continuing to move downward.
A thermal reactor as recited in claim 3, wherein said
displacer means (35) is also operable to displace the

cradle (58) vertically downward.

displacer means (35) is operable to displace the cradle

(58) vertically downward whilst simultaneously displacing 
the susceptor (36) from the second position to a third

lower position.

dependent on claim 2, wherein the means (34) for imparting

rotary motion to the susceptor includes:

rotary motion to the susceptor (36);
(ii) a motor (120); and
(iii) a torque transfer means (122,124,126,128) for
transferring torque from the motor (120) to the drive

shaft (52).

transfer means includes:


(i) a rotationally-fixed, hollow pedestal (128);
(ii) a cup (102) rotationally which is mounted about the
pedestal (128), which is engaged by the motor and which

includes a first ring (142) of magnetic elements
disposed along its interior surface; and

hollow pedestal (128) and which supports the drive

shaft (52) and which includes a second ring (142) of
magnetic elements disposed about its outer perimeter to

be concentric with the first ring (126) of magnetic
elements, whereby when the cup is rotated by the motor

(120), the first ring (126) of magnetic elements
transfers rotary motion to the second ring (142) of 

magnetic elements, thereby rotating the drive shaft
(52).
A thermal reactor as recited in claim 7, wherein the first
ring (126) of magnetic elements is constituted by permanent

magnets and the second ring (142) by elements of magnetic
material.
A thermal reactor as recited in claim 3 and any preceding claim

displacing the drive shaft (52); wherein

the first cylinder (90) is attached to a fixed mounting
(98) and the second cylinder (92) is attached to the

first cylinder, so that operation of the first cylinder
(90) causes vertical displacement of the cradle (58)

and of the second cylinder (92) thereby displacing the
susceptor (36), while operation of the second cylinder

(92) causes only displacement of the susceptor (36).
