<ABSTRACT>
The present invention relates to a process for the preparation and workup of N-hydroxyalkylchitosans which are soluble in aqueous medium, comprising the measures of     dispersion of chitosan in an aqueous medium,   subsequent hydroxyalkylation of the dispersed chitosan and   subsequent workup of the N-hydroxyalkylchitosan, which is characterised in that the hydroxyalkylation is carried out up to an average degree of substitution (DS) of 2.0, preferably 1.5 to 2.0, after the hydroxyalkylation and before the workup a part of the aqueous medium is removed where appropriate, and the workup of the N-hydroxyalkylchitosan takes place by drying.

<CLAIMS>
A process for the preparation and work-up of water-soluble
N-hydroxalkylchitosans comprising the

measures

dispersion of chitosan in water,
subsequent hydroxyalkylation of the dispersed
chitosan and
subsequent work-up of the N-hydroxyalkylchitosan,

wherein the ratio of chitosan to the hydroxyalkylation
reagent used is 1:3-8 mol/mol, based on

the chitosan monomer unit, the hydroxyalkylation is
carried out up to an average degree of substitution

(DS) of 2.0 and the work-up of the N-hydroxyalkylchitosan
is performed by drying.
The process as claimed in claim 1, wherein the
hydroxyalkylation is carried out up to a DS of from

1.5 to 2.
The process as claimed in claim 1, wherein the
chitosan used is deacetylated by 40 to 96%, based

on the original chitin, and has an average degree
of polymerization (DP) from 100 to 10,000. 
The process as claimed in claim 1, wherein the
original chitin has a DP of from 300 to 8,000.
The process as claimed in claim 1, wherein the
ratio of water to chitosan is

4-12:1.
The process as claimed in claim 1, wherein epoxides
are used for the hydroxyalkylation.
The process as claimed in claim 1, wherein the
drying is carried out by contact drying.
The process as claimed in claim 1, wherein the
drying is carried out by roller drying.
The process as claimed in claim 8, wherein the
roller drying is carried out at a roller

temperature in the range from 90 to 140Â°C.
The process as claimed claim 1, wherein the drying
is carried out by convection drying.
The process as claimed in claim 1, wherein the
drying is carried out by spray-drying.
A water-soluble hydroxyalkylchitosan ether
obtainable by the process of claim 1, wherein the

hydroxyalkylchitosan ether is hydroxyalkylated up
to an average degree of substitution (DS) of 2.0

and has a residual epoxide content below 5 ppm.
