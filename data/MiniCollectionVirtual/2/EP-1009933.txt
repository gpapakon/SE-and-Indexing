<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a device for energy conversion from wave movement in water,
comprising a frame connectable to a seabed, a container for containing a gas,
which container is formed by at least two parts, a first part connected to the frame
and a second part displaceable in vertical direction relative to the first container
part for varying the working volume of the container, and energy converting
means for energy conversion from the displacement of the second container part.There exist wave energy converters which have a gas-filled container which is situated
below the water surface. Due to wave movements on the water surface pressure
differences will occur periodically under the water surface. The pressure differences
result in vertical movement of the gas-filled container, which movement can for
instance be converted to drive a generator. Such an apparatus is disclosed in GB 1
604 372 with a first tank member which moves relative to a second buoyant tank
member. The tank members cooperate in a gas tight manner such that compressed
gas or partial vacuum may be used as a source of power. The existing wave energy
converters are optimized for energy conversion at a determined, frequently occurring
wavelength which is generally local. When wavelengths differ, the efficiency of energy
conversion is cosiderably lower than at the wavelength for which the converter has been
optimized.The present invention has for its object to provide a wave energy converter of which the
adjustment can be optimized for varying wavelengths. In addition, the device must have
a simple construction.The invention provides for this purpose a device for energy conversion from wave
movement in water according the type disclosed above, characterized in that,
the device also comprises means for changing the range of the working volume of
the container. The working volume of the gas-filled part of the container is varied by
mutual movement of the parts of the gas-filled container. The range of the working 
volume of the gas-filled space thus determines at least partially the spring curve of the
device. This spring curve can be influenced by changing the range of the working
volume of the gas-filled part of the container. The desired oscillation frequency is
thereby variable and the optimal adjustment of the device can be varied for diverse
wavelengths. The efficiency of this device is considerably greater than the efficiency of
existing devices for wave energy conversion, particularly in an environment in which
wavelengths of
