<ABSTRACT>
A regulator for use in underwater breathing 
comprises a primary housing with a breathing chamber and 

a demand valve (20) enabling flow of air, upon demand by 
a user, from an inlet orifice (22) to an output (16) in 

the valve (20) and then to an outlet (32) in the primary 
housing and then via a mouthpiece (29) to the lungs of a 

user. The valve (20) comprises a slidably mounted poppet 
(21) one end (23) of which is urged against orifice (22) 

by a biasing spring (25). Movable diaphragm (28) in 
response to demand for air draws end (23) of the poppet 

away from the orifice (22) against the force of the 
biasing spring (25) allowing the flow of air. A 

concentric sleeve about the valve body may be rotated to 
adjust the flow of air through the regulator.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to self contained 
underwater breathing apparatus and more specifically 
relates to improvements in regulators associated therewith 
whereby the breathing characteristics in a regulator are 
altered so as to reduce the inhalation effort required by 
a user upon demand for air. The alteration in the 
breathing characteristics is effected according to the 
present invention by adjustments to the demand valve in 
the regulator. Regulators are well known in the diving industry as a 
crucial component of the apparatuses required. A 
regulator acts in concert with a pressure reducing valve 
and as a means for regulation of air for a diver. The 
pressure reduction activity is known as the first stage of 
regulation and this involves the reduction in air pressure 
between the air tank and the regulator. The supply of air 
upon demand by a diver passes through the first stage 
thence through a second stage. It is the second stage of operation to which the 
present invention is primarily directed. The second stage of operation is controlled by a 
demand valve which is located near the air discharge end 
of the regulator which comprises a mouthpiece. It is one object of the present invention to reduce 
the effort required on the part of the user of the 
regulator upon demand for air. Regulators are well known with numerous designs for 
these being readily available. In its most basis form a 
typical regulator comprises a housing having a mouthpiece 
and a demand valve which acts in concert with a vacuum 
assisted diaphragm located inside the housing. The 
diaphragm is, and consequently the demand valve, are 
operably responsive to demand for air. The demand valve 
is typically adapted with an internal element known as a 
poppet which is adapted to operate between a closed and 
open position in response to demand for air by a user.  The poppet when in the closed position, is urged 
against an air inlet hole in the valve under the 
assistance of a spring bias closing off the supply of air 
via the inlet. The compression force in the spring must 
be at least slightly greater than the pressure exerted 
immediately upstream of the inlet orifice to enable the 
closing of the orifice. The poppet moves from the closed configuration to an 
open configuration upon demand for air. When the poppet 
is open unbalanced forces are generated due to the 
gradient of increasing effort required to overcome the 
increasing compressive force exerted by the spring bias 
when demand is made for air by the

<CLAIMS>
A breathing regulator for use in underwater breathing 
comprising; 

a primary housing with a breathing chamber, a valve enabling 
travel of air upon demand by a user from an inlet to an 

outlet in the valve thence to an outlet in the housing via a 
mouth piece to the lungs of a user, 

a movable diaphragm for creating a vacuum in the housing 
responsive to demand for air, characterised in that the 

regulator also comprises a venturi assisted air directing 
means comprising an opening in the body of said valve and a 

rotatable and adjustable concentric sleeve about said valve 
body and with an opening therein which selectively, partly 

or wholly, aligns with said opening in the valve body to 
either direct and throttle the free flow of air to the 

mouthpiece via the shortest distance, inhibit or prevent the 
free flow of air through said regulator according to which 

direction and the degree to which the concentric sleeve is 
rotated about the valve body. 
A regulator according to claim 1 wherein the adjustable 
concentric sleeve is selectively adjustable via a knob 

external of the regulator. 
A regulator according to claim 2 wherein the selective 
adjustment of the mechanical sleeve via said knob alters the 

direction of the air either towards or away from the 
mouthpiece of the regulator. 
A regulator according to claim 3 wherein the concentric 
sleeve is made from a plastics material. 
A regulator according to claim 4 wherein the said knob 
has associated therewith gradations indicating the available 

settings for said concentric sleeve.
