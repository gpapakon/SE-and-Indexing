<ABSTRACT>
A system (10) for interlocking a plurality of modules (12, 14, 16; 104, 106), such as medical instrument modules (e.g., infusion pumps), in side-by-side relationship such that not more than one module (12, 14, 16; 104, 106) can be mounted on each side of a center module (14; 104). The modules (12, 14, 16; 104, 106) are interchangeable in that any module of the system (10) can be a center module (14, 104) or a side module (12, 16; 106). In the preferred embodiment, latching arms (20, 22) on a module (14) are automatically moved as the module (14) is mounted on a pole stand (17) to allow other "side" modules (12, 16) to be mounted on that "center" module (14). The latching arms (20A, 22A, 20B, 22B) of the "side" modules (12, 16) prevent additional modules from being mounted on the side modules (12, 16). Other embodiments are described as well.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates generally to a system for 
mounting modules in side-by-side relation at one another, and more particularly to 
a system for mounting modules, such as medical instrument 
modules, on a pole stand. In modern medical practice a variety of 
diagnostic and therapeutic instruments are used, sometimes 
to such a degree that floor and shelf space near the 
patient's bedside is at a premium. One known solution to 
the problem of mounting instrument modules is the use of a 
pole stand, which allows equipment to be mounted 
vertically over a relatively small footprint on the floor. 
Often such pole stands have wheels for the convenience of 
the operator in moving them to where they are needed. It 
is a well known problem in the hospital setting that such 
wheeled stands are easily unbalanced upon, for example, 
crossing thresholds or exiting elevators. A related concern is matter of rapidly mounting 
and demounting various instruments in a hospital setting. 
In a crisis situation, it can be important that the proper 
mounting of an instrument module be accomplished 
expeditiously. Even in routine operations, a convenient 
and reliable mounting system would increase efficiency 
while enhancing patient comfort. In particular, infusion 
therapy is performed on many patients in the hospital, and 
due to incompatibilities in drug chemistry or infusion 
regimen, this often requires several infusion lines. Over 
the course of a hospital stay, the number of infusion 
lines, and hence the number of infusion pumps managing the 
flow within them, is likely to vary. The cost of patient 
care is reduced if the infusion pumps can rapidly be 
redeployed where needed. Examples of infusion pumps that have typically 
been mounted on pole stands are shown in U.S. 
Patent No. 5,017,192 and U.S. Design Patent No. 278,181.  
 
Typically, a single infusion pump has been mounted on the 
pole stand at one vertical location along the stand. If 
additional infusion pumps were needed, they would be 
mounted on separate pole stands, or at a different 
vertical location along the same pole stand, or on 
specially designed multi-pole adaptors or stands that 
provide a plurality of spaced apart vertical pole sections 
for mounting infusion pumps. Such infusion pumps have 
been available from Minnesota Mining and Manufacturing 
Company, St. Paul, Minnesota, under various trade 
designations, such as the "AVI 200", "AVI 400" and "AVI 
480" model series. Dual channel infusion pumps have also been 
available in which one pump
