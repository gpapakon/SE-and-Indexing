<ABSTRACT>
A process for upgrading low-quality wood comprising a 
softening stage, wherein one or more sections of low-quality wood 

are heated, in the presence of an aqueous medium and at a pressure 
which is at least the equilibrium pressure of said medium at the 

operating temperature, to a temperature in the range of from 120 to 
160 °C and maintaining said temperature until the temperature 

difference between the centre and the outer parts of the sections 
is less than 20 °C, which is followed by heating to a temperature 

in the range from 160 to 240°C for not more than 1 hour until the 
temperature difference between the centre and the outer parts of 

the sections is less than 20°C, a dewatering stage and a curing 
stage.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a process for upgrading low-quality 
wood to high-quality wood in an environmentally sound way, and to 
high-quality wood obtained by means of this process. Such a process 
is known from EP 0373726. According to this document a cellulosic fibrous aggregate is 
formed from a cellulosic fibrous material by a process which 
comprises: a softening stage comprising exposing a section of 
cellulosic fibrous material to the action of an aqueous softening 
agent at a temperature in the range of from 150 °C to 220 °C at a 
pressure of at least the equilibrium vapour pressure of the 
softening agent at the operating temperature, thereby at least 
partially disproportionating and hydrolysing the hemicellulose and 
lignin present in the cellulosic fibrous material; and a curing 
stage comprising drying the product of the softening stage at a 
temperature in the range of from 100 °C to 220 °C to yield a 
cross-linked cellulosic matrix. This process uses traditional ways of heating and drying the 
wood. These methods rely on thermal conduction to raise the 
temperature of the wood and evaporate water contained therein. The 
poor thermal conductivity of wood and the sensitivity of the 
process chemistry to extended heating times, result in limitations 
on product thickness and quality for such process. Furthermore, it 
has been found that gradients in temperature, pressure and moisture 
concentration induce stresses in wood, which may result in the 
formation of cracks and consequent loss of mechanical strength. 
Hence it can be concluded that there is need for a process for 
upgrading low-quality wood which allows the processing of sizable 
sections of low-quality wood. Surprisingly it has now been found that relatively large 
sections of low-quality wood can be upgraded in a process as  
 
described hereinbefore by using a specific heating profile wherein 
the sections of wood are first heated to an intermediate 
temperature followed by a waiting period to obtain a temperature 
balance between the centre and the outside of said sections, 
whereafter the temperature of the heated sections is raised to the 
ultimately desired temperature. The present invention therefore relates to a process for 
upgrading low-quality wood to high-quality wood comprising: a) a 
softening stage, wherein one or more sections of low-quality wood 
are heated in the presence of an aqueous medium and at a pressure 
which is at least the equilibrium pressure of said medium at the 
operating temperature, to a
