where R
1
, R

, R
3
 and R
4
 are each as defined above, in 
aqueous phase, characterized in that the coupling reaction 

is carried out in the presence of a dispersant based  
 

on ligninsulfonate or on an arylsulfonic acid-formaldehyde 
condensate, these products each comprising from 3 to 

50% by weight, based on the weight of the dispersant, of 
one or more aromatic or long-chain aliphatic carboxylic 

acids, their salts, their anhydrides or a mixture 
thereof.

are each as defined in claim 1. 
A process as claimed in claim 1, characterized in 
that from 1 to 10% by weight of dispersant is used based 

on the weight of 2-amino-3-cyano-4-chloro-5-formylthiophene 
and aniline of the formula II. 
A process as claimed in claim 1, characterized in 
that dispersants are used comprising 


A) from 50 to 97% by weight of one or more arylsulfonic 
acid-formaldehyde condensates, one or more ligninsulfonates 

or a mixture thereof, and 
B) from 3 to 50% by weight of one or more aromatic or 
long-chain aliphatic carboxylic acids, their salts 

or their anhydrides or a mixture thereof.
