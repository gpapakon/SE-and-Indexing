<ABSTRACT>
An intermediate part (17) is provided with the opposingly facing lateral walls (17a, 
17b) with the space of a base (15a) of said part therebetween and being open at the 

upper side thereof, said intermediate part being located between a barrel (19) to 
which the end portion of a high-voltage resistant cable (1) is crimped and 

adhesively pressed and a connecting portion (16) to which an electrode is 
connected from the exterior. A stopper (22) is formed by cutting and lifting the 

base of the intermediate part and is contacted with the fold-back portion of the 
high-voltage resistant electrical cable at the end section thereof. A break-off 

preventing portion (23) consisting of a plate-like portion is also provided, said 
plate-like portion protruding from the upper end of at least one of the opposingly

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a terminal for an electrical cable that is
resistant to a high voltage and, more particularly, to a terminal connecting the
high-voltage resistant cable to electrical parts operating at high voltage, such as
ignition plugs, ignition coils, distributors and the like, used e.g. in a motor vehicle
internal-combustion engine.Fig. 10 shows an example of a high-voltage electrical cable 1
composed of a highly resistant coiled conductor 2, made of a resistant wire such as
nickel-chrome wire or the like wound on an insulation core, and an insulation
coating 3 consisting of thick rubber or the like coated on the conductor 2.There also exists another kind of high-voltage electrical cable
comprised of fibres coated with carbon paint.Fig. 11 shows an example of a known terminal, disclosed by Japanese
utility model examined publication No. S55-27981, which is used for connecting
the aforementioned high-voltage resistant electrical cable 1 to an electrode such as
an ignition plug or the like.In order to join this terminal 5 to the high-voltage resistant electrical
cable 1, the insulation coating 3 thereof is peeled off at a specified length from its
terminal end to expose the conductor 2. The exposed conductor 2 is folded back at
the end portion of the insulation coating 3 so as to extend over the outer surface
thereof, where it forms a fold-back portion 2a.The above-mentioned end portion of high-voltage resistant electrical
cable forming the fold-back portion 2a is adhesively pressed to the barrel portion
6a, 6b of the terminal 5. The part of the fold-back portion 2a extending over the
end section of the insulation coating 3 abuts against a stopper 7 which is formed by
cutting and lifting a base 5a portion of the terminal 5.In this terminal 5, the fold-back portion 2a is protected and a good
contact is established between the conductor 2 and the terminal 5 due to the fact
that the fold-back portion 2a is in contact with the stopper 7, as described above.However, the stopper 7 according to this prior art terminal 5 is formed
by cutting and lifting the base 5a of the terminal 5. This weakens the base portion
7a of the cut-and-lifted part. The stopper 7 may then break or fall off at the
connecting portion 8. For this reason, such kind of terminal 5 has to be made of a
hard material such as SUS 430 and has to have a sufficient thickness. However, 
this manufacturing practice renders its formability and electric conductivity less
appropriate.Further, it would be preferable if the stopper 7
