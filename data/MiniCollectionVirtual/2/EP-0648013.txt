<ABSTRACT>
Device for distributing fast analogue signals to several users, characterised in that it comprises:   - a card of the "backplane" (F) type, on which is printed, in the form of a track, at least one two-wire distribution line (D1...DN) one end of which is fed by a source (S1...SN) of the signal to be distributed, and the other end of which is terminated on a load impedance (Zc) equal to the characteristic impedance of the line; - connection sockets (E1...EP) for printed cards, fixed onto the backplane card (F) and distributed along the distribution line (D1...DN); and - user printed cards (C1...CP) each equipped with a connector (Q) able to plug into one of the sockets (E1...EP) of the backplane printed card (F), each of these user cards (C1...CP) including an amplifier (A) the high-impedance input of which is linked to the distribution line (D1...DN) via its connector (Q) and the corresponding socket (E1...EP), and the low-impedance output of which is linked to a connection terminal (BS) for a user (U1...UP).

Device according to Claim 1 or 2, 
characterised in that
 the
low-impedance output of the amplifier (A) is matched to the

impedance (Z

Device according to any one of Claims 1 to 3, 
characterised
in that
 the distribution line (D
1
...D
N

of the line with an impedance changing device (M) and is

terminated at its other end with a load impedance (Z

the impedance set by said impedance changing device (M).
Device according to any one of Claims 1 to 4, in which the
printed circuit backplane (F) contains several distribution

lines (D
1

characterised in that
 the
switching device (RL) is composed of a non-coaxial standard

relay.
Device according to Claim 6, 
characterised in that
 a
monitoring and comparison device (L) is inserted in the

control circuit of the relay (RL) to compare a signal relating
to the actual state of the energizing coil (BR

relay (RL) and a signal relating to the assumed state of this

coil, and to generate an alarm in case of disparity between
these two signals.
