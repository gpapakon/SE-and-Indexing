<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a magnetic recording
medium, and more particularly, to a magnetic recording
medium including a backing layer which has a very smooth and
flat surface and which does not adhere to a magnetic layer
when the medium is stored over a long period.Recently, as recording density of magnetic recording
media is enhanced, the surfaces of their magnetic layers
have become more mirror-like, thereby making stable
traveling of magnetic tapes difficult. In practice,
therefore, a backing layer is provided on the opposite
surface of a support with respect to a magnetic layer to
ensure stable traveling performance of a magnetic recording
medium. In order to prevent a surface-form of the backing
layer from being transcribed to the magnetic layer, there is
acute need for smoothness of the backing layer itself.
However, if the magnetic layer and the backing layer both
have smooth and flat surfaces, the two layers adhere to each
other after the magnetic recording medium is stored in a
wound state for a long time. This phenomenon causes damages
to the magnetic layer, so as to lead to increase in dropout
and occurrence of jittering of images. In addition, as portable video cameras have been
popular, they have come to be used under a variety of
situations such as an outdoor field, etc. As a result, it
is necessary to prevent adhesion when the cameras are
exposed to severe environments such as high temperature and
high humidity over long periods.To prevent adhesion, addition of a silicone oil is
known. However, since the silicone oil generally has poor
compatibility with binders, it is liable to cause defects in
coating films such as repelling, pin holes, and the like.
Proposed is an attempt for improving compatibility between
silicone oils and binders by denaturing the silicone oils
using fatty acids (JP-A-61-273720). This is effective as
long as the compatibility is concerned. However, since the
silicone oil and the binder are not fixed to each other, the
silicone oil transfers to the magnetic layer when stored in
a wound state for a long period. Thus, preventing adhesion
does not last long. Furthermore, the silicone oil
transferred to the magnetic layer often affects
electromagnetic characteristics of the magnetic layer.
Another proposal is to use a reaction product of a reactive
polysiloxane and a reactive resin. This approach is not
successful in achieving sufficient non-adhesion property,
because the polysiloxane is taken into the resin so as to
hinder molecular orientation of the
