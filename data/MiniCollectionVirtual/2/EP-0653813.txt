<ABSTRACT>
A system for removing electrical charges from a 
memory card (10) when the card is electrically coupled to 

a header connector (18) of an electronic apparatus (12). 
The header connector has a plurality of pin terminals (24, 

26) mounted therein, including a plurality of pin signal 
terminals (24). The memory card includes a circuit 

substrate (30), and an elongate receptacle (42) mounted at 
an edge (38) of the substrate. A plurality of receptacle 

terminals (46, 48) are mounted within the receptacle, and 
include receptacle signal terminals (46) which are adapted 

for electrical connection to corresponding pin signal 
terminals (24). A pair of cover plates (44) sandwich the 

circuit substrate therebetween. At least a portion of one 
of the cover plates is conductive. One of the receptacle 

terminals includes a receptacle ground terminal (48) 
coupled to the conductive portion of the one cover plate. 

A pin ground terminal (26) is provided on the header 
connector of the electronic apparatus. The receptacle 

ground terminal (48) and the pin ground terminal (26) are 
adapted for interconnection to remove electrical charges 

from the memory card before connection of the receptacle 
signal terminals (46) and the pin signal terminals (24) 

when the memory card is electrically coupled to the header 
connector.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention generally relates to the art of
electrical connectors and, particularly, to a system for
removing electrical charges stored in a data input device,
such as a memory card, when the data input device is
connected to an electronic apparatus.Typically, connectors for data input devices,
such as memory cards, are electrically connected to an
electronic apparatus or storage device, such as a word
processor, personal computer or other electronic apparatus.
The data stored in the memory card is transferred to the
electronic apparatus via the connector. Memory cards are
portable instruments and, consequently, electrostatic
charges often are generated in the memory cards during
handling. When a memory card which is electrostatically
charged is inserted into the connector of the electronic
apparatus, the charges flow or discharge to the electronic
apparatus through the connecting terminals of the connector.
This may result in malfunctioning or damage to the
underlying electronic apparatus or to the circuit elements
on the memory card itself.Heretofore, in order to protect the memory card
and electronic apparatus from such adverse effects of
electrostatic discharging, a metal housing of the card is
grounded to the apparatus. To facilitate grounding and to
provide effective electrostatic discharging protection,
memory cards often are equipped with additional features or 
grounding components, such as grounding clips, grounding
layers within the card itself, or grounding projections
within the connector of the electronic apparatus. Such
designs typically involve significant additional
manufacturing costs associated with the components
themselves, as well as costly assembly procedures.This invention is directed to a very simple
system for protecting interconnections between data input
devices, such as memory cards, and electronic apparatus
from damage by electrostatic discharges, and involving
little additional costs to the manufacture of the system.GB-A-2 248 973 discloses a receptacle connector adapted to connect
a circuit substrate to a grounded header connector, and
adapted to be assembled within a protective cover member having
at least one conductive portion, said receptacle connector including
a housing having a plurality of receptacle terminals
mounted therein, each receptacle terminal having a mating portion
adapted to mechanically and electrically engage a respective
pin terminal mounted within the grounded header connector,
and contact portion adapted to mechanically and electrically
engage a
