<ABSTRACT>
A two stage process for catalytically reforming a gasoline boiling range hydrocarbonaceous feedstock. The reforming is conducted in two stages wherein the first stage (R1 and R2) is operated in a fixed-bed mode, and the second stage (R3 and R4) is operated in a moving-bed continual catalyst regeneration mode. A gaseous stream comprised of hydrogen and predominantly C4- hydrocarbon gases are separated (S1) between stages. A portion of the hydrogen-rich gaseous stream is recycled (line 22) and the remaining portion along with the C5+ stream (line 24) are sent to second stage reforming (R3, R4).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a two stage process for
catalytically reforming a gasoline boiling range hydrocarbonaceous
feedstock. The reforming is conducted in two stages wherein the first
stage is operated in a fixed bed mode, and the second stage is operated
in a moving-bed continual catalyst regeneration mode. A gaseous stream
comprised of hydrogen and predominantly C4- hydrocarbon gases are
separated between stages and at least a portion of it is recycled.Catalytic reforming is a well established refinery process
for improving the octane quality of naphthas or straight run gasolines.
Reforming can be defined as the total effect of the molecular changes,
or hydrocarbon reactions, produced by dehydrogenation of cyclohexanes,
dehydroisomerization of alkylcyclopentanes, and dehydrocyclization of
paraffins and olefins to yield aromatics; isomerization of substituted
aromatics; and hydrocracking of paraffins which produces gas, and
inevitably coke, the latter being deposited on the catalyst. In
catalytic reforming, a multifunctional catalyst is usually employed
which contains a metal hydrogenation-dehydrogenation (hydrogen transfer)
component, or components, usually platinum, substantially atomically
dispersed on the surface of a porous, inorganic oxide support, such as
alumina. The support, which usually contains a halide, particularly
chloride, provides the acid functionality needed for isomerization,
cyclization, and hydrocracking reactions.Reforming reactions are both endothermic and exothermic, the
former being predominant, particularly in the early stages of reforming
with the latter being predominant in the latter stages. In view
thereof, it has become the practice to employ a reforming unit comprised
of a plurality of serially connected reactors with provision for heating
the reaction stream as it passes from one reactor to another. There are
three major types of reforming: semi-regenerative, cyclic, and 
continuous. Fixed-bed reactors are usually employed in semi-regenerative
and cyclic reforming, and moving-bed reactors in continuous
reforming. In semi-regenerative reforming, the entire reforming process
unit is operated by gradually and progressively increasing the
temperature to compensate for deactivation of the catalyst caused by
coke deposition, until finally the entire unit is shut-down for
regeneration and reactivation of the catalyst. In cyclic reforming, the
reactors are individually isolated, or in effect swung out of line, by
various piping arrangements. The catalyst is

A process for catalytically reforming a gasoline

reforming zones wherein each of the reforming zones contains a reforming

refractory support, which process comprises;


(a) reforming the reactant stream in a first reforming stage
comprised of one or more serially connected reforming zones containing a

fixed-bed of catalyst comprised of one or more Group VIII noble metals
on a refractory support, which one or more reforming zones are operated

at reforming conditions which includes a (gauge) pressure of from 100 to 500
psig (6.896 to 34.48 bar), and a H

 mol ratio in the range of from 1 to 10,
thereby producing a first effluent stream;
(b) passing said first effluent stream to a separation zone
wherein a hydrogen-rich predominantly C

a predominantly C

(c) recycling a portion of the hydrogen-rich gaseous stream to

of the hydrogen-rich gaseous stream, in a second reforming stage

operated at a pressure which is at least 50 psi (3.45 bar) lower than that

descends through the reforming zone, exits, and Is passed to a
regeneration zone where it is regenerated by burning-off at least a

portion of any accumulated carbon, and wherein the regenerated catalyst
is continually recycled back to the one or more reforming zones.

second reforming stage contains one or two moving-bed reforming zones,

the catalyst descends through a first moving-bed reforming zone, is
passed to a second moving-bed reforming zone where it descends through

said second moving-bed reforming zone, then is passed to a regeneration
zone where any accumulated carbon is burned-off, after which the

regenerated catalyst is recycled to said first moving-bed reforming
zone.

separated from at least a portion of the reaction stream of the first

reforming stage thereby producing an aromatics-rich stream and an

The process of claim 4 wherein the aromatics
separation between stages is accomplished by a technique selected from

extractive distillation, distillation, and flashing.
