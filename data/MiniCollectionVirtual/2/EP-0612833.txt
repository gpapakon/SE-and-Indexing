<ABSTRACT>
The invention provides a surface-treating agent for 
a metal can, which diminishes friction on an outside surface 

of the can without giving a bad influence on attachability 
of paint, lacquer and the like and shows high safety to the 

human body. Furthermore, the invention provides a method 
for treating a metal can surface with said surface-treating 

agent. The surface-treating agent for a metal can is 
characterized by containing an ester compound between a 

polyglycerol and fatty acid(s) as an essential component. 
To diminish a friction coefficient of the metal can 

surface, the surface-treating agent is brought into contact 
with the metal can surface.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a surface-treating
agent for a metal can and a method for treating a metal can
surface, which are applied to a metal can surface to
diminish friction on the surface and thereby, bring about a
surface condition preferable to production of the can. In
detail, the invention relates to a surface-treating agent
for a metal can and a method for treating a metal can
surface, which diminish friction on an outside surface of
the metal can, especially an aluminum can, without giving a
bad influence on attachability of paint or lacquer and
thereby, which can improve mobility on a conveyor.The metal can is used as a vessel for various
products and, especially, the aluminum can is widely used as
the most common metal can. Hereinafter, the aluminum can
is cited as an example and explained.The aluminum can is washed by an acid cleaner and
the like to remove fine aluminum powder and other
contaminators after the can main body being produced.
However, recently, because of environmental problems and
because an acid liquid remaining on the can after washing by
acid gives a bad influence on the smell of can contents, 
removal of fine powder and other contaminators by washing by
alkali has been desired.However, if the washing by alkali is carried out to
remove fine powder in an inside of the aluminum can, an
outside surface of the can becomes coarse in such condition
and the can does not smoothly move on a belt conveyor in a
process to fill the can contents, a process to print the
can surface and other processes, so that the following
problems occur: the mis-supply of cans, productivity
decrease, increase in the can-losing ratio, and the like.Therefore, it is desired to diminish the friction on
an outside surface of the can without giving a bad
influence on attachability of paint, lacquer and the like to
the outside can surface.Japanese Official Patent Provisional Publication
(Kokai) No. showa 64-85292 describes phosphoric acid
esters, ethylene oxide adducts of fatty acids, ethylene
oxide adducts of higher alcohols and the like as surface-treating
agents for a metal can, to solve the above-mentioned
problems.However, since the aluminum can and the like are
often used for food articles and since the above-mentioned
compounds have a problem in safety to the human body, the
compounds cannot be used as a widely used surface-treating
agent for a metal can. EP-A-293820 discloses a process for treating metal
surfaces by spraying a water soluble organic material such
as esters of fatty acids

<CLAIMS>
Use of a surface treating agent containing an
ester compound between a polyglycerol and oleic

acid as an essential component to treat a metal
can surface to diminish a static friction

coefficient of the surface wherein the ester
compound has an esterified ratio of 1 to 30%.

Claim 1 wherein the polyglycerol is at least one

member selected from a group consisting of
diglycerol, triglycerol, tetraglycerol, pentaglycerol,

hexaglycerol, heptaglycerol, octaglycerol and
nonaglycerol.
Use of a surface-treating agent as claimed in
claim 1 or Claim 2 wherein the agent is diluted by

water.
