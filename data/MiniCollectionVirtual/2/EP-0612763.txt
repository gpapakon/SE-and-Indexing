Compounds of formula (I) 

 
in which: 


R
1
 represents an acetylated or non-acetylated amino 
acid residue having the L or D configuration, 
R
2
 represents an amino acid residue having the L or D 
configuration, the C-terminal function of which is an 

amide or free acid function, 
X
1
 and X
2
 are selected from amino acid residues that 
permit cyclisation by means of an amide bond and that 

confer on the ring so formed a number of atoms equal to 
22, 
Tyr represents the L-tyrosyl residue, 
D-Trp represents the D-tryptophyl residue, 
Lys represents the L-lysyl residue, and 
Val represents the L-valyl residue, 
 
their enantiomers, diastereoisomers and epimers, as well 

as their addition salts with a pharmaceutically acceptable 
acid or base.  

 
Compounds according to claim 1 in which X
1
 represents 
the L-glutamic acid residue (Glu) and X
2
 represents the 
L-2,4-diaminobutyric acid residue (Dab), their enantiomers, 

diastereoisomers and epimers, as well as their 
addition salts with a pharmaceutically acceptable acid or 

base. 
Compounds according to claim 1 in which X
1
 represents 
the L-aspartic acid residue (Asp) and X
2
 represents the 
L-ornithine residue (Orn), their enantiomers, diastereoisomers 

and epimers, as well as their addition salts with 
a pharmaceutically acceptable acid or base. 
Compounds according to claim 1 in which X
1
 represents 
the L-homoglutamic acid residue (
homo
Glu) and X
2
 represents 
the L-2,3-diaminopropionic acid residue (Dpr), 

their enantiomers, diastereoisomers and epimers, as well 
as their addition salts with a pharmaceutically acceptable 

acid or base. 
Compounds according to claim 1 in which X
1
 represents 
the L-2,4-diaminobutyric acid residue (Dab) and X
2
 
represents the glutamic acid residue (Glu), their 

enantiomers, diastereoisomers and epimers, as well as 
their addition salts with a pharmaceutically acceptable 

acid or base. 
Compounds according to claim 1 in which X
1
 represents 
the L-ornithine residue (Orn) and X
2
 represents the L-aspartic 
acid residue (Asp), their enantiomers, 

diastereoisomers and epimers, as well as their addition 
salts with a pharmaceutically acceptable acid or base. 
Compounds according to claim 1 in which X
1
 represents 
the L-2,3-diaminopropionic acid residue (Dpr) and X
2
 
represents the L-homoglutamic acid residue (
homo
Glu),  
 

their enantiomers, diastereoisomers and epimers, as well 
as their addition salts with a pharmaceutically 

acceptable acid or base. 
Compound according to claim 1 which is: 

 
its enantiomers, diastereoisomers and epimers, as well as 

its addition salts with a pharmaceutically acceptable 
acid or base. 
Process for the preparation of compounds of 
formula (I) according to claim 1, characterised in that 

it is effected using an automatic apparatus which 
carries out, in a repetitive and programmable manner, 

cycles of deprotections, couplings and washing steps 
which are necessary for the sequential introduction of 

the amino acids into the peptide chain, the amino acid, 
which is preferably C-terminal, being attached to a resin 

customarily used for the preparation of polypeptides, the 
choice of resin allowing the desired C-terminal function 

to be attached, by introducing the amino acids in excess, 
relative to the degree of substitution of the resin, and 

in an approximately equivalent amount relative to the 
coupling agents, one by one, in the order determined by 

the operator, each synthesis cycle corresponding to the 
introduction of one amino acid comprising deprotection, 

successive washing steps in order to remove the reagents, 
coupling with activation of the amino acid, and further 

washing steps, each of those operations being followed by 
filtration which is carried out through sintered glass 

incorporated into the reactor in which the synthesis is 
carried out, then, once the cycles of deprotections, 

couplings and washing steps are complete, by treatment  
 

with a strong acid in the presence of anisole in order to 
separate the peptide from the resin and, where appropriate, 

to free the peptide of its protecting groups, and 
then cyclisation of the peptide in the presence of BOP 

and DIPEA, the compounds of formula (I) so obtained then 
being purified by conventional purification techniques. 
Pharmaceutical compositions containing as active 
ingredient at least one compound according to any one of 

claims 1 to 8, on its own or in combination with one or 
more inert, non-toxic, pharmaceutically acceptable 

excipients or carriers. 
Pharmaceutical compositions according to claim 10 
containing at least one active ingredient according to 

any one of claims 1 to 8, for use, on account of their 
inhibiting activity on the proliferation component of 

vascular smooth muscle cells, in the treatment and 
prevention of atherosclerotic vascular lesions, in the 

prevention of vascular re-stenoses following bypass 
surgery, following vascular dilation, and following 

heart transplant, and for use in the prevention and 
treatment of vascular changes associ
ated with arterial 
hypertension or with diabetes, as well as in the 

treatment of cancers and dermatological disorders.
