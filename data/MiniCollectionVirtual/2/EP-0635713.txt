a plurality of vessels (31) mounted on the base; an agitation 

mechanism (33-35) for agitating a liquid content (32) of the vessels; 
and a head (38) supported above each of the vessels and operable 

to automatically inject a liquid media into the vessel. 
Retained by the control head (38) is a spray wash tube (39) connected 
to the spray wash line (16), a media fill tube (41) connected to the 

fill line (19), an aspiration probe (42) connected to the aspirate line 
(18), a sampling probe (43) connected to the sampling line (17), a pH 

adjustment and media replacement tube (44) connected to a pH adjustment 
and media replacement line (45) and a temperature detector (46). Also 

retained by the control head (38) is an aspiration probe drive mechanism 
(48), a sample probe drive mechanism (49) (Fig.3), a stepping motor (51) 

(Fig.4) and an interconnect board (52). Connected to the interconnect 
board (52) is a cable connector (53) that receives a plug (54) (Fig.5) 

on the electrical cable (21). The head is covered by a cover (50). 
A sample tablet dispenser (57) is mounted on the control head (38)

<DESCRIPTION>
In pharmaceutical laboratories, dissolution testing 
is playing an increasingly important role. Such testing 
determines the amount of active substance in a pharmaceutical 
formulation unit given off to a defined medium within a defined 
period of time. The active substance is generally contained 
in a pharmaceutical dosage form such as a capsule, tablet, 
coated tablet or the like, which is used as a therapeutic 
agent. Typically, a dissolution test is run in a vessel that 
contains a known volume of media which is usually DI water kept 
at a temperature of 37C. The active substance is dropped 
into the vessel of media and a paddle is spun to gently 
agitate the media. Samples are removed periodically and 
injected into analyzer equipment such as UV cells, fraction 
collectors or HPLC systems. After completion of a test 
cycle, the vessels are thoroughly washed before initiation of 
a subsequent cycle. Because most of the operational 
procedures are performed manually, current dissolution testing 
is highly labor intensive.  
 In EP-A-278 374 there is disclosed a dissolution 
testing system including a plurality of vessels mounted 
on a base and a head mechanism mounted above the vessels 
and vertically movable relative thereto. Retained by the 
head for each vessel is an agitating paddle, drive 
mechanism and drive shaft therebetween. However, the head 
does not include a fill means operable to automatically 
inject liquid media into the vessel nor a media handling 
means mounted for movement relative to the drive shaft of 
the paddle. According to the present invention there is 
provided a dissolution testing system comprising base 
means; a plurality of vessels mounted in situ on said 
base means; agitation means for agitating a liquid 
content of said vessels; said agitation means comprising 
a paddle disposed in each vessel, a drive shaft coupled 
to each paddle and drive means for rotating said drive 
shafts; and head means supported above each of said 
plurality of vessels; characterised in that said head 
means comprises fill means operable to automatically 
inject a liquid media into said vessel; and in that said 
head means further comprises liquid media handling means 
mounted for movement relative to said vessel and said 
shaft therein, said movement having a component parallel 
thereto.  
 According to one feature of the invention, the head 
further includes a spray nozzle for introducing a cleaning 
liquid into the vessel. Automatic washing further 
reduces the labor intensiveness of the
