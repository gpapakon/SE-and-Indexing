<ABSTRACT>
Improved polybenzoxazole fibers are made by a process for finishing a spun and drawn dope fiber, which contains polybenzoxazole polymer and a solvent acid, comprising the steps of: (a) coagulating the dope fiber in an aqueous coagulant; (b) washing the coagulated fiber with an aqueous washing fluid for less than 72 hours under conditions such that the fiber contains no more than 8,000 ppm residual solvent acid (1 ppm = 1 part per million, by weight); (c) drying the fiber at a temperature of 120  C to 300  C until it retains no more than 2 weight percent residual moisture; and (d) heat-treating the fiber at a temperature of at least 300  C under tension.

<DESCRIPTION>
 IMPROVED PROCESS FOR POST-SPIN FINISHING OF POLYBENZOXAZOLE FIBERS• This invention relates to the art of making heat-treated polybenzoxazole fibers.It is known to spin and heat-treat fibers that contain polybenzazole polymer. See, for example, Wolfe, U.S. Patent 4,533,693 (August 5, 1985) at col. 166-174; Takeda, Japanese Kokai 2(1990)-84511 (published March 26, 1990); and Ledbetter etal., "An Integrated Laboratory Process for Preparing Rigid Rod Fibers from the Monomers," The Materials Science and Engineering of Rigid Rod Polymers at 253, 259-61 (Materials Research Society 1989). Ordinarily, a dope is formed containing the polymer and a solvent acid. The dope is forced through a spinneret and drawn across an air gap. It is contacted with a coagulating liquid, usually water, to coagulate the polymer and form a fiber. The fiber is washed to remove residual acid. The resulting fiber is heat-treated to improve its modulus.It has not previously been recognized that polybenzoxazole fibers can be damaged by the processes used to wash and heat-treat them after spinning. Surprisingly, the tensile strength of the damaged fiber can remain relatively high for several weeks after the fiber is manufactured, but the tensile strength decreases with the passage of time. More surprisingly, the same decrease is not observed in some closely related fibers, such as PBT. An object of the present invention is to choose washing, drying and heat-treating conditions that form a fiber capable of retaining significant tensile strength over time.The present invention is a process for finishing a spun and drawn dope fiber, which contains polybenzoxazole polymer and a solvent acid, having the steps of:(A) coagulating the dope fiber in an aqueous coagulant;(B) washing the coagulated fiber with an aqueous washing fluid until the fiber contains no more than 8,000 ppm residual solvent acid (1 ppm = 1 part per million, by weight); (C) drying the fiber; and(D) heat-treating the fiber at a temperature of at least 300°C under tensioncharacterized in that:(1) the fiber is washed in Step (B) for less than 72 hours; and(2) the fiber is dried in Step (C) at a temperature of 120°C to 300°C until it retai ns no more than 2 weight percent residual moisture. 

 Fibers made according to the process of the present invention retain their tensile properties well. The fibers can be used for ordinary purposes of high-strength fibers, such as in ropes, composites and other structural applications.5 The present invention uses a lyotropic liquid
