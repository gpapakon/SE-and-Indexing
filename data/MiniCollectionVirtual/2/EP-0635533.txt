<ABSTRACT>
A liquid crystal aligning agent is provided which contains a 
polyimide comprising repeating units of general formula (VII) and 

optionally general formula (V): 

where A³ represents a tetravalent organic group of constituting a 
tetracarboxylic acid, A⁴ represents a divalent organic group of constituting a 

diamine, B represents a divalent organic group, R¹ and R⁵ may be the same 
or different and each represents an alkyl group, a substituted alkyl group, a 

phenyl group or a substituted phenyl group, m represents an integer of 1 or 
more, and n represents an integer of from 1 to 6; provided that n, m, A³, A⁴, 

B, R¹ and R² may optionally be different ones in every repeating unit, and 
the combination of the repeating units are:  
a) a unit of formulae (V) and (VII), or 
b) a unit of formulae (VII) 
 
and the polyimide having a weight-average molecular weight of 10,000 or 

more and having a siloxane group in the side chain thereof.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a polyimide having a
siloxane chain in its side chain, which is produced from a
diaminobenzene starting material and has excellent heat-resistance
and solvent-resistance and also excellent surface
characteristics. It concerns a liquid crystal-aligning agent,
which contains a polyimide having a siloxane chain in its side
chain. The polyimide is produced from a diaminobenzene
starting material having a siloxane chain and having excellent
heat-resistance, solvent-resistance and surface characteristics.
Where a substrate for a liquid crystal is treated with the liquid
crystal-aligning agent, liquid crystal molecules provided on the
substrate are aligned to the substrate, with an elevated tilt
angle. In particular, the polyimide of the present invention, 
may be formed into a film which displays excellent heat-resistance,
permeability and separatability when used in separation
of a gaseous mixture or a liquid mixture. It may be thinned
with ease to give a thin film having a sufficient film strength and
a high separating capacity. The film is therefore useful as a
separation film.Hitherto, aromatic polyimides have widely been used as
protecting materials, insulating materials and adhesives in the
filed of electronic appliances and also as films or construction
materials in other various fields, because of their high mechanical
strength, heat-resistance and solvent-resistance. However,
conventional polyimides have various drawbacks that the shaping
workability is poor, the flexibility is poor, the wet stability is
poor and the adhesiveness to inorganic materials such as silicone
wafer or glass is insufficient. In order to overcome the drawbacks,
modified polyimides having various chemical structures have been
produced and studied in these days. Above all, a technique of
producing a polyimide/polysiloxane block copolymer from a polyimide
precursor to be obtained by substituting a part of the diamine
component of a starting material of a polyimide by a polysiloxane
having a diamino group at the both terminals thereof has been
proposed, for the purpose of improving the flexibility and
adhesiveness to inorganic materials among the necessary properties 
of polyimides. (For instance, refer to JP-A-57-143328, 58-7473, 58-13631,
61-83228 and 61-118424. The term "JP-A" as used herein means
an "unexamined published Japanese patent application".) However,
such block copolymers may have improved flexibility and
adhesiveness but, on the other hand, have a problem that the filming
capacity
