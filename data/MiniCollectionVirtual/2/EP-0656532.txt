intensities detected by the infrared intensity detecting unit 
(3), and a heat source moving direction detecting unit (6) which 

obtains the moving direction of the heat source, from temporal 
vector displacement of the center of gravity obtained by the 

infrared center of gravity detecting unit (5).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a heat source detector
which detects a position of an infrared heat source such as a
human body and a moving direction of a heat source position.Conventionally, radiation light (infrared rays) emitted
from an infrared heat source such as a human body is detected
by an infrared sensor. An infrared sensor detects a heat
source by using a passive method in which light is not
irradiated on a measuring object such as a human body and
radiation light spontaneously emitted from a heat source is
detected. Therefore, the heat source detection can be
conducted without adversely affecting the measuring object such
as a human body, and without illumination even during the
night. Consequently, such a detection using an infrared sensor
has a wide variety of applications.Fig. 1 shows an example of a heat source detector using
an infrared sensor. In the figure, the heat source detector
comprises a pyroelectric infrared sensor 1. A shield plate 18
having an aperture 12 is slidably disposed under the infrared
sensor 1, and a plurality of Fresnel lenses 16 are arranged
under the shield plate 18. In the thus configured detector, an
image of radiation light from a heat source in each of zones A 
to C shown in the figure is formed by the Fresnel lenses 16 on
an infrared ray sensing device of the infrared sensor 1 so that
the heat source is detected. When the aperture 12 of the
shield plate 18 is positioned above the zone A as shown in the
figure, the zone A constitutes the detection object zone. If
a person is in the zone A, for example, an image of radiation
light from the body of the person is formed on the infrared ray
sensing device of the infrared sensor 1, and it is detected
that the human body functioning as a heat source is in the zone
A. If no person is in the zone A, no radiation light is
detected. As a result, it is possible to know the presence or
absence of a heat source in the zone A.When the shield plate 18 is slidingly moved so as to be
positioned above the zone B and the same operation as that
described above is conducted, it is possible in the same manner
to know the presence or absence of a heat source in the zone B.
Similarly, it is possible also to know the presence or absence
of a heat source in the zone C.When the shield plate 18 is moved at regular time
intervals and the presence or absence of a heat source is
detected in each of the zones A to C, information about the
moving direction of a heat source, i.e., whether the heat
source is moved from the zone A to the zone
