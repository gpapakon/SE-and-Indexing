<ABSTRACT>
This invention relates to an improved process for the coincineration 
of municipal solid waste and municipal sewage sludge by dewatering the 

sludge, breaking it up into sufficiently small particles and employing 
oxygen enrichment of the combustion process. This is accomplished without 

undesired excursions of flue gas flow rate and temperature.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to an improved process for the combustion of 
sludge waste in a municipal solid waste incinerator. More particularly, 
this invention relates to a process wherein the sludge is dewatered and the 
dewatered sludge is divided into fine particles. The process also 
comprises introducing the sludge at a particular point in the combustion 
zone and enriching the combustion air with oxygen. Sewage sludge is a byproduct of wastewater treatment, either primary 
or secondary. The disposal of sewage sludge from wastewater treatment 
plants is a growing environmental problem throughout the world, especially 
in the United States, Europe and Japan. In many areas of the world the 
dumping of sludge into the ocean has recently been banned, such as, for 
example, western Europe and the United States. Generally, there is a 
pressing need for economical and environmentally safe methods for disposing 
of sewage sludge. Present methods for disposal of sewage sludge include landfilling, 
land application, composting and pelletization for making fertilizers, 
incineration, and wet oxidation. Land application, composting, and 
pelletization, which attempt to utilize the sludge as a fertilizer, have 
quality requirements on such things as the heavy metals content in the 
sludge. If these limitations are exceeded, disposal options are normally 
limited to landfilling, incineration, and wet oxidation. In highly 
industrial areas such as the northeastern United States, southeastern 
Canada, western Europe and Japan, a compounding of factors further 
aggravates the sludge disposal problem. In these areas sludge volumes tend 
to be the highest, sludge quality is often poor (high heavy metals), and 
landfill space is scarce.  Another waste with disposal challenges similar to sewage sludge is 
municipal solid waste (MSW). Although the physical properties of sewage 
sludge and MSW are very different, their elemental compositions on a dry 
basis are very similar, with primary components of carbon, hydrogen, 
oxygen, and ash. The major difference between sewage sludge and MSW is in 
their moisture contents. MSW generally contains about 20 to 30 wt% 
moisture. Raw sewage sludge from wastewater treatment is essentially a 
liquid slurry, and normally contains only 2 to 4 wt% solids in water. To 
reduce the weight and volume for disposal, wastewater treatment plants 
often dewater the sludge to between 15 and 30 wt% solids by mechanical 
means. Mechanical dewatering causes a drastic change in the physical 
properties

<CLAIMS>
In a process for the co-incineration of a solid waste and 
sewage sludge containing solid particulate matter in an incineration system 

comprising a combustion zone containing a grate on which the solid waste is 
combusted, means for introducing the solid waste onto the grate, means for 

introducing combustion supporting air in to the combustion zone including 
primary air inlet means for introducing combustion supporting air at a 

point beneath the grate and secondary air inlet means for introducing 
combustion supporting air at a point above the grate, and means for 

introducing sewage sludge into the combustion zone, which process comprises 
combusting the solid waste on the grate, introducing combustion supporting 

air, and combusting the sewage sludge in the combustion zone, the 
improvement which comprises: 


a) dewatering the sludge to a solids content from about 15 to 
about 30 percent by weight; 
b) finely dividing the solid particulate matter in the sludge to 
particles smaller than about 1000 microns; 
c) introducing the sludge into the combustion zone at a point 
above the solid waste on the grate and not above the point at 

which the secondary air is introduced to the combustion zone; 
and 
d) enriching at least a portion of the combustion supporting air 
with oxygen to an oxygen concentration of at least about 21 

percent by volume. 
The process of Claim 1 wherein the amount of enrichment oxygen 
added to the combustion zone is in the range from about 0.5 to about 8 

pounds of oxygen per pound of dry sludge. 
The process of Claim 2 wherein the amount of enrichment oxygen 
added to the combustion zone is in the range from about 3.5 to about 5.5 

pounds of oxygen per pound of dry sludge. 
The process of Claim 1 wherein the particulate matter in the 
sludge is finely divided by introducing the sludge into the combustion zone 

by means of a dual-fluid atomizer which utilizes a secondary fluid 
atomizing medium. 
The process of Claim 4 wherein the atomizing medium is gas. 
The process of Claim 5 wherein the gaseous atomizing medium is 
air. 
The process of Claim 6 wherein the gaseous atomizing medium is 
oxygen enriched air. 
The process of Claim 1 wherein the solid particulate matter in 
the sludge is divided into particles smaller than about 500 microns. 
The process of Claim 1 wherein CO in the gas exiting the 
combustion zone is measured and the quantity of enrichment oxygen added is 

controlled so as to maintain the CO at a predetermined level. 
The process of Claim 1 wherein the flow rate of flue gas 
exiting the combustion zone is measured and the quantity of enrichment 

oxygen added is controlled so as to maintain the flue gas flow rate at a 
predetermined level.
