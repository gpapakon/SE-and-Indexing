<ABSTRACT>
A distributed storage system is disclosed in which an 
originating storage location establishes the criteria for 

storage management for a file. When the file is transmitted to 
other, subsidiary storage locations, it is accompanied by 

information controlling the storage of the file. For example, 
the duration of storage will be controlled by the control 

information. When a master file is deleted from an archive, in 
accordance with the criteria established at the time of 

storage, copies of the file at subsidiary locations can either 
be rendered inaccessible or alternately the storage management 

for that file can be changed. A feature is the distribution of 
storage management control information along with the file to 

diverse storage locations in a complex data processing system.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention disclosed broadly relates to data processing 
systems and more particularly relates to the management of 
storage in a data processing system. The following patents are related to the invention disclosed 
herein and are incorporated herein by reference:
 
USP 5,093,911 by C. A. Parks, et al. entitled "Storage and 
Retrieval System," assigned to the IBM Corporation and 
incorporated herein by reference. USP 5,161,214 by M. R. Addink, et al. entitled "Method and 
Apparatus for Document Image Management in a Case Processing 
System," assigned to the IBM Corporation and incorporated 
herein by reference. Systems Managed Storage (SMS) is the management of data objects 
in a storage hierarchy within a single system. Objects move 
through DASD, optical shelf libraries, tape, and so on within 
the confines of the single system. In an environment with 
distributed servers, a single SMS process for objects is 
insufficient. The problem is as follows:
 
Objects captured and stored at one server location may require 
movement to another server for permanent archival storage or 
for temporary use at that server.  When an object moves to another server for archival purposes, 
it may need to assume different management characteristics. When an object is copied to another server for temporary use, 
it may need to assume different management characteristics. When an object has been moved to another server for archival 
purposes and a copy has been left behind in the original 
server, the copy may need to assume different management 
characteristics. Current SMS solutions do not cover these problems because of 
their limitation to single servers. It is therefore an object of the invention to provide an 
improved method for managing storage in a data processing 
system. It is still another object of the invention to provide an 
improved method for parallel, system managed storage for 
objects on multiple servers in a data processing system. These and other objects, features and advantages are 
accomplished by the invention disclosed herein. A distributed 
storage system is disclosed in which an originating storage 
location establishes the criteria for storage management for a 
file. When the file is transmitted to other, subsidiary storage 
locations, it is accompanied by information controlling the 
storage of the file. For example, the duration of storage will 
be controlled by the control information. When a master file is 
deleted from an archive, in accordance with the criteria 
established at the time

<CLAIMS>
In a data processing system having a plurality of storage 
devices, including an originating storage device and an 

archiving storage device, a method for parallel system 
managed storage for objects, comprising the steps of: 

receiving an object file at an originating storage 

location; 
assembling control information to control the storage of 

said file in a storage device; 
transmitting a copy of said file and said control 

information to a second storage device in said data 
processing system; 

performing said control functions at said second storage 
device in response to said control information. 
The method of claim 1 which further comprises: 
said control information controlling a duration of storage 

for said object file. 
The method of claim 2 which further comprises: 
deleting said object file at said originating storage 

location; 
reading said control information at said second storage 

location associated with said copy of said file; 
deleting said copy of said file at said second storage 

location, in response to said control information. 
The method of claim 1, which further comprises: 
selectively performing alternate local option control 

functions at said second storage device. 
The method of claim 1, wherein said control information 
controls the migration of said object file to a third 

storage device in said system. 
The method of claim 1, wherein said control information 
controls the migration of said object file to a third 

storage device in said system after a duration from said 
receiving at said originating location. 
In a data processing system having a plurality of storage 
devices, including an originating storage device and an 

archiving storage device, a subsystem for parallel system 
managed storage for objects, comprising: 

receiving means for receiving an object file at an 
originating storage location; 

assembling means coupled to said receiving means, for 
assembling control characters to control the storage of 

said file in a storage device; 
transmitting means coupled to said assembling means, for 

transmitting over a communication link a copy of said file 
and said control characters to a second storage device in 

said data processing system; 
control means coupled to said communication link, for 

performing said control functions at said second storage 
device in response to said control characters. 
The subsystem of claim 7 which further comprises: 
said control characters controlling a duration of storage 

for said object file. 
The subsystem of claim 8 which further comprises: 
first deleting means coupled to said receiving means, for 

deleting said object file at said originating storage 
location; 

reading means coupled to said control means, for reading 
said control characters at said second storage location 

associated with said copy of said file; 
second deleting means coupled to said reading means, for 

deleting said copy of said file at said second storage 
location, in response to said control information. 
The subsystem of claim 7, wherein said object file is an 
image object file. 
The subsystem of claim 7, wherein said control information 
controls the migration of said object file to a third 

storage device in said system. 
The subsystem of claim 7, wherein said control information 
controls the migration of said object file to a third 

storage device in said system after a duration.
