<ABSTRACT>
A circuit architecture (1) for testing a programmable logic 
matrix (2), e.g. the PLA type, comprises a series (7) of 

input latches (ILi) and a corresponding series (8) of 
output latches (OLi) connected to the matrix (2) and test 

information paths structured with at least one data bus 
(11) and one address bus (12). The input latch (7) and 

output latch (8) are connected electrically to the test 
data bus (11) and the test address bus (12) and this allows 

matrix testing with considerable time saving compared with 
the known art.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a circuit architecture
for the configuration of combinatory networks comprising a
programmable logic matrix and which permits testing of said
matrix.More specifically the present invention relates to a
combinatory network architecture comprising a programmable
logic matrix of the PLA type connected between input and
output latches and test and address information paths
(BUS).The present invention also relates to a method for
testing and control of signals deriving from the PLA
matrix.As known, many digital devices such as for example
microprocessors, memories and/or decoders contain a control
unit provided by means of a state machine comprising a
combinatory network provided through a programmable logic
matrix and a battery of latches which memorises the state
machine.The programmable logic matrix is usually the PLA
(Programmable Logic Array) type.In combinatory networks of a certain complexity testing
of the PLA is very important and especially if it is the
dynamic type.Indeed, the possible failures of a dynamic PLA are not
tied only to the logical correctness of the network because
it requires a precharging phase for the internal nodes. 
These nodes maintain their value in voltage only by
capacitive effect. Therefor, any resistive discharge paths
to ground are a problem.To check the absence of failures in a structure of this
type it is normally necessary to generate a sequence of so-called
test vectors which supply the data to be applied at
the input of the combinatory network and the sample outputs
which should be the result of normal operation. Comparison
of the real outputs of the device with the sample outputs
permits identification of a malfunction of the PLA.It is noted however that a dynamic PLA has a timed
operation divided in precharge and evaluation which
requires a synchronisation signal. To carry out the test
it is necessary to accede to this signal by means of one of
the external pins to the memory circuit.Therefore, in accordance with the known art, to perform
the test it is necessary to connect the PLA inputs with the
outputs of one of the binary counters in the circuit.In this manner it is necessary to perform a very long
count to achieve a sufficient cover from possible failures.
In particular, if the PLA has Ni input variables, to have a
logic value '1' on the most significant bit by activating
the transistors connected to said node it is necessary to
perform 2Ni-1 clock cycles.This operation obviously takes a long time for access
which slows down the
