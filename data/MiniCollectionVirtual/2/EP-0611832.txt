<ABSTRACT>
The present invention relates to a process for producing castings, in which the casting mass is cast, in the liquid state, in a mould, cooled down and then removed from the mould, whereupon a local heat treatment is carried out at such temperatures and over such a period of time that regions of different hardness are produced. This local heat treatment is carried out in particular at temperatures above twice the overageing temperature. The invention furthermore relates to an oil trough with at least one flange and a base region, which trough is produced by casting, in particular by pressure die casting, and is distinguished by hardness of HB 85 - 110 and a ductility of 0.5 - 2.5 % in the flange region and a hardness of HB 55 - 80 and a ductility above 4 % in the base region.

Method for the manufacture of oil sumps for motor 
vehicles, in which a casting compound consisting of a metal 

alloy in liquefied form is poured into a mould, cooled and 
then removed from the mould, characterised in that after 

removal from the mould, local heat treatment is performed 
at such temperatures and over such a period of time that 

zones of different hardness arise. 
Method according to claim 1, characterised in that local 
heat treatment is performed at a temperature above twice 

the overageing temperature. 
Method according to claim 1 or 2, characterised in that 
the liquid metal alloy is sand-cast. 
Method according to claim 1 or 2, characterised in that 
casting of the liquid metal alloy is performed by 

diecasting. 
Method according to claim 1 or 2, characterised in that 
casting of the liquid metal alloy is performed by chill 

casting. 
Method according to one or more of claims 1 to 5, 
characterised in that an aluminium alloy is used. 
Method according to claim 6, characterised in that an 
AlSi10Mg alloy is used. 
Method according to claims 4 and 7, characterised in 
that local heat treatment is performed at temperatures 

between 380°C to 480°C for three to four minutes. 
Method according to one or more of claims 1 to 8, 
characterised in that the casting is quenched and tempered  

 
before local heat treatment. 
Method according to one or more of claims 1 to 9, 
characterised in that local heat treatment is performed by 

means of an open flame, e.g. gas flame. 
Method according to any of claims 1 to 9, characterised 
in that local heat treatment is performed by means of a 

radiant electric heater. 
Method according to one or more of claims 1 to 11, 
characterised in that the regions of the casting which are 

not subjected to the subsequent local heat treatment are 
cooled during the heat treatment. 
Method according to claim 12, characterised in that 
this cooling is performed by water cooling. 
Method according to claim 12, characterised in that 
this cooling is obtained by means of cooled profile jaws or 

by means of an air jet. 
Oil sump for a motor vehicle with at least one flange 
and a bottom region, which exhibits a hardness of 85 to 110 

HB and a ductility of 0.5 to 2.5% in the flange region and 
a hardness of 55 to 80 HB and a ductility of over 4% in the 

bottom region.
