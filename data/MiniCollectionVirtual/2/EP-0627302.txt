<ABSTRACT>
Apparatus and method for manufacturing a green radial 
pneumatic tyre. The apparatus is provided with a construction 

drum (2) for a tread with a belt for the radial pneumatic 
tyre, with a carcass drum (4) for carrying a carcass with 

beads and side walls for the radial pneumatic tyre and 
with an annular transfer unit (5) movable along a path (8) for 

transferring the annular tread/bead assembly to the carcass 
drum. The transfer unit is provided with a passage 

part for surrounding the drums, and with a pressure roller 
unit with at least one roller (9) rolling the belt/tread 

assembly against the carcass with the beads and the side 
walls. The passage part is provided with a gate (29) for 

radially admitting each roller (9) to the carcass with beads 
and side walls, the pressure roller unit being provided 

with means (14) for displacing each roller radially through the 
gate. Each gate of the passage part as seen in a direction 

parallel to the direction of movement of the passage part 
near the carcass drum is provided with a passage opening 

for each roll. In the method during the pressing of the 
tread/belt assembly onto the carcass with the beads and 

the side walls the transfer unit is transferred to a 
distance from the carcass drum.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to an apparatus for manufacturing a
green radial pneumatic tyre, which apparatus is provided
with a construction drum for a tread with a belt for the
radial pneumatic tyre, with a carcass drum for carrying a
carcass with beads and side walls for the radial pneumatic
tyre, with an annular transfer unit movable along a path
for transferring the annular tread/belt assembly to the
carcass drum, which transfer unit is provided with a
passage part for surrounding the drums, and with a pressure
roller unit with at least one roller rolling the
belt/tread assembly against the carcass with the beads and
the side walls, the passage part being provided with a
gate for radially admitting each roller to the carcass
with beads and side walls, the pressure roller unit being
provided with means for displacing each roller radially
through the gate.The invention further relates to a transfer unit for use
in such an apparatus and to a method for manufacturing a
green radial tyre.An apparatus as mentioned in the preamble is known from
European patent EP-B1-0.223.317. In this known apparatus
that which is needed for pressing the belt/tread assembly
and the carcass with the beads and the side walls is
realized by a pressure roller unit with a static pressing
roller with at least one roller or group of coaxial
rollers radially movable through the gate in the passage
part. In this known apparatus the transfer unit stays in
place around the carcass drum during pressing, so that a
relatively short period is needed for the manufacture of a
green radial tyre. By a carcass drum can be understood a carcass construction
drum for a carcass with beads and side walls or a drum for
expanding an airtight carcass with beads and side walls.
Green radial tyres manufactured by apparatuses of the typeas named in the preamble can be divided into so-called
tread over sidewall construction and sidewall over tread
construction. These two constructions will henceforth be
referred to as TOS (tread over sidewall) and SOT (sidewall
over tread) respectively.In the case of a radial SOT pneumatic tyre after the
tread/belt assembly has been placed on the carcass with
beads and sidewalls, the sidewalls are bent in such a way
that they cover the edges of the tread after which the
mutual pressing of the tread/belt assembly against the
carcass with beads and sidewalls takes place with the help
of the pressure roller unit. For some tyre constructions
it is in this case desirable to roll the sidewalls over
the entire length of the bead up
