<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to apparatus for contactless
interrogation of a sensor producing an output, comprising coil
means for magnetically coupling signals across a gap between a
sensing circuit having a sense coil and an interrogation circuit
having an exciter coil connected to a frequency supply, the
exciter coil conducting current induced therein by current in the
sense coil which is related to the output of the sensor.The invention also relates to a method for contactless
interrogation of a sensor producing a sensor output dependent on
changes in a physical parameter, comprising the steps of using
the sensor output to change the value of a variable component in
a sensing circuit, applying an electrical frequency input signal
to the sensing circuit by magnetic coupling across a gap, and
determining the sensor output as a function of the frequency
input signal.Such apparatus and methods are known from WO-A-91 00985.
The invention is concerned with a problem which can arise because
of the gap across which the signals have to be magnetically
coupled and the effect which this gap may have on the sensor
output.Accordingly, the apparatus as first set forth is
characterised by control means controlling the frequency supply
to apply two different operating frequencies to the exciter coil
such that the current induced in the exciter coil by the sense
coil is compensated for the gap.Further according to the invention, the known method as 
first set forth above is characterised in that the step of
applying the frequency input signal to the sensing circuit
applies the frequency input signal at first and second different
operating frequencies such that a circuit output signal is
produced which is dependent on the value of the variable
component and which is compensated for the gap.Embodiments of the invention may incorporate so-called
"smart" structures in which the sensors are embedded or
integrated in the structures and monitor one or more structural
parameters such as stress, strain. Such smart structures are
described, for example, in US-A-4 983 034 and US-A-4 930 852.
The basic concept is that the integrated sensors can be used as
health monitors for the structure to characterize the structural
performance of the materials. Having such real time or near real
time information can allow structures to be designed up to the
material limits. In fact, the structures can further include
active elements that provide adaptive compensation for structure
performance. Such a smart structure concept is disclosed in US-A-4
