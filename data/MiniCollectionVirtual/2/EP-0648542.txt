<ABSTRACT>
The device comprises a first wide-meshed screen or mesh (2) which bears against the calender (1b, 1'b) of the basket (1, 1'), at least one impermeable flexible tube (3a, 3'a, 3''a) connected to a source of pressurised gas which is against the first screen or mesh (2), a second screen or mesh (4), identical to the first, covering the tube (3a, 3'a, 3''a) so that the latter is sandwiched between the screens or meshes (2 and 4), and a fine-meshed filtering screen (5) covering the second screen or mesh (4).

A device for removing the decanted solid layer
retained against the filter cloth of the basket of a

centrifuge with a horizontal or vertical axis after
centrifuging the substance to be treated, of the type

comprising a flexible, elastically deformable element,
connected to a pressurised gas source, to break up the

cake and/or the residual layer by a thrust effect,
characterised in that it comprises a first wide-meshed

cloth or grill (2) which bears against the calender
(1b, 1'b) of the basket (1, 1'), at least one flexible

hermetic tube (3a, 3'a, 3''a), connected to a
pressurised gas source, which lies against the first

cloth or grill (2), a second cloth or grill (4)
identical to the first covering the tube (3a, 3'a, 3''a)

so that the latter is sandwiched between the first
cloth or grill (2) and the second cloth or grill (4),

and a fine-meshed filter cloth (5) covering the second
cloth or grill (4).
A device according to Claim 1, characterised in
that the surface of the flexible tube (3a, 3'a, 3''a) at

rest is smaller than that of the calender (1b, 1'b) of
the basket (1, 1').
A device according to Claim 1, characterised in
that the flexible tube (3a, 3'a, 3''a) comprises a

connector (3d, 3'd, 3''d) which is connected to a
pressurised gas source.
A device according to Claim 1, characterised in
that the flexible tube (3a) is in the form of a torus.
A device according to Claim 1, characterised in
that it comprises a flexible tube (3'a) in the shape of 

a C closed at its ends, which is integral on its
periphery with regularly-spaced vertical pockets (3'b),

the entire unit being placed between the first cloth or
grill (2) and the second wide-meshed cloth or grill (4)

such that the pockets (3'b) extend vertically and
parallel to the calender (1b) of the basket (1).
A device according to Claim 1, characterised in
that it comprises a flexible tube (3''a) closed at its

two free ends and arranged in a helix between the first
cloth or grill (2) and the second cloth or grill (4).
A device according to Claim 1, characterised in
that the flexible tube (3''a) is arranged sinusoidally.
A device according to Claim 1, characterised in
that the flexible tube (3a, 3'a, 3''a) and the pockets

(3'b) are made of a hermetic plastics material
resistant to the substances to be treated.
A device according to Claim 1, characterised in
that the flexible tube (3a, 3'a, 3''a) is placed in a

hermetic pocket (7) which is resistant to the
aggression of the chemical products.
A device according to Claim 9, characterised in
that the pocket (7) is of a larger size than that of

the tubes (3a, 3'a, 3''a) and/or of the pockets (3'b).
A device according to Claim 1, characterised in
that one of the ends of the first cloth or grill (2),

of the second cloth or grill (4) and of the filter
cloth (5) are fixed into the upper part of the calender

(1b) just below the crown (1c), whilst the opposite
ends of the second cloth or grill (4) and of the fine-meshed

filter cloth (5) are integral with the bottom 
(1a) close to the holes (1d) in the basket (1) of a

centrifuge having a vertical axis.
A device according to Claim 11, characterised in
that the surfaces of the second cloth or grill (4) and

of the filter cloth (5) are larger than that of the
calender (1b) of the basket (1).
A device according to Claim 1, characterised in
that the ends of the cloths (2 and 4) and of the filter

cloth (5) are fixed into the basket (1') at the same
level as the internal bore (1'd) of the crown (1'c) of

a centrifuge having a horizontal axis.
