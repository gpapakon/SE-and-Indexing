<ABSTRACT>
Process for deactivating residues from burning of industrial or household waste or of metal hydroxide sludge, enabling the toxic metals present in this waste to be immobilized in the long term by stabilization. The process includes especially the stages of heating of a mixture including the waste to be treated and one more nucleating agents containing especially ferrous compounds. The heating is carried out in such conditions that it makes it possible to obtain a mixture in liquid phase, also called molten mixture or melt, in which at least 5 % of the oxides Fe2O3 are converted into oxides FeO. The process also includes the controlled cooling of the melt until a solid material is obtained in which the heavy metals present in the treated waste are included within crystal structures, and the recovery of the solid material is obtained. The stage of heating may comprise a stage of stabilization of the mixture at a temperature permitting the complete liquefaction of the mixture to be treated.
