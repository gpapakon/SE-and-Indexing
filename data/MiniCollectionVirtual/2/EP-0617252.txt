<ABSTRACT>
A retractable sootblower (10) having a substantially open frame (112). 
The frame (112) includes an inboard end wall (114), an outboard end 

wall (116) and 
a pair of opposingly positioned side panels (120). The side panels (120) 

are 
seamless and mounted to interconnect the inboard end (114) and outboard 

end walls (116) together. At least one truss (122) extends between 
the side 

panels (120). The side panels (120) cooperating with the inboard and 
outboard end walls (114,116) to generally define a rectangularly shaped 

box 
for enclosing the carriage (18) and lance tube (14) of the 

sootblower (10). 
This box has a generally open top and bottom which provides 

substantially unobstructed access from above and below to the 
carriage (18) and lance tube (14). The sootblower (10) also includes a 

mechanism for adjusting the backlash between the drive rack (28) and 
gear (26).

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention generally relates to sootblowers and 
particularly relates to improvements in the frame structure and 
drive mechanism of a retractable sootblower. Sootblowers are used to project a stream of blowing medium, 
such as water, air or steam, against heat transfer surfaces 
within large scale boilers or other heat exchangers to cause slag 
and ash encrustations to be removed. The impact of the blowing 
medium produces mechanical and thermal shock which causes the 
adhering encrustation layers to be removed. One general category of sootblowers is known as the long 
retracting type. These devices have a retractable lance tube 
which is periodically advanced into and withdrawn from the boiler 
and which is simultaneously rotated such that one or more nozzles 
at the end of the lance tube project jets of blowing medium 
against the encrusted heat exchange surfaces in the boiler. Sootblower designers are constantly striving to enhance 
design efficiency in terms of construction cost, operation, 
inventory cost and maintenance. In a conventional retractable 
sootblower, an elongated frame or beam houses a moveable 
carriage. The carriage drives a lance tube from one end of the 
frame to the other during the extension and retraction motion. 
Various configurations for sootblower frames are known. In one well-known configuration, sheet metal plate stock is 
press brake formed to define three sides of a generally 
rectangular shaped member defining the elongated frame. In a  
 
typical installation, the open portion of the frame faces 
downward. The carriage is driven to move within the frame and 
the frame supports the lance tube suspended therein. Such 
conventional sootblower frames are known as closed frames since 
their upper surface is enclosed and inaccessible. Examples of 
presently known sootblower designs are provided with reference 
to U.S. Patents 2,668,978; 3,439,376; 3,585,673; 3,604,050, 
4,229,854 and 4,351,082. Although these closed frame type 
sootblowers perform in a satisfactory manner, they do have 
certain drawbacks. One drawback results from the method in which the frame is 
formed. Since the three sided frame member is brake formed from 
flat sheet metal stock, a limitation on the length (typically 
twenty feet) of the member is presented by the brake forming 
machine. To form a longer frame member, separate three sided 
members are butt welded together. Obviously, forming the butt 
welds requires an additional and separate bonding step to be 
included in the production
