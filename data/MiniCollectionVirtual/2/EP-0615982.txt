<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a modified 
α-olefin polymer whose side chain has tertiary carbon, 
and a stretched film produced thereof. More specifically, 
it relates to a modified α-olefin polymer excellent 
in impact resistance, heat resistance and mechanical 
properties and suitable for use in the fields of a 
structural material and a film; and a stretched film 
produced thereof. A 4-methyl-1-pentene polymer has a melting 
point of 220 to 240°C and shows a high heat deflection 
temperature, and it has excellent transparency and 
release characteristics. It is hence widely used in 
the fields of MWO tableware, release films and release 
paper for synthetic leather. However, a 4-methyl-1-pentene 
polymer is not much used in structural materials 
due to its poor impact resistance and mechanical 
strength. Further, it shows low stretchability, and in 
particular, the biaxial stretching thereof is difficult. 
For improving a 4-methyl-1-pentene polymer in 
impact resistance, there has been proposed a blend of a 
4-methyl-1-pentene polymer and a specific ethylene-α-olefin 
copolymer (Japanese Laid-open Patent Publication 
No. 164,349/1984). Since, however, this blend contains 
the above ethylene-α-olefin copolymer having low heat 
resistance as a rubber component, the blend shows 
extremely low heat resistance as compared with a 4-methyl-1-pentene 
polymer and an article formed from the 
blend is also poor in mechanical properties such as 
flexural strength and flexural modulus. It has been also proposed to modify polyolefins 
with acrylic acid, methacrylic acid or a derivative 
of these (Japanese Laid-open Patent Publications 
Nos. 10,606/1988 and 140,212/1990), and a radical 
initiator such as peroxide or the like is used in 
combination in these cases. However, an α-olefin  
 
polymer having at least 3 carbon atoms such as 4-methyl-1-pentene 
polymer undergoes a decomposition reaction 
due to radical generated from the radical initiator and 
shows a sharp decrease in molecular weight. For this 
reason, the so-obtained modified polyolefin has very 
low mechanical properties. On the other hand, in a 
crosslinked polyolefin such as polyethylene, the crosslinking 
proceeds to result in a similar decrease in 
mechanical properties of a modified product. Further, it has been also proposed to modify 
polyolefins with acrylic acid, methacrylic acid or a 
derivative of these (Japanese Laid-open Patent Publications 
Nos. 120,608/1983 and 83,111/1988), while it has 
not yet been proposed to use metal
