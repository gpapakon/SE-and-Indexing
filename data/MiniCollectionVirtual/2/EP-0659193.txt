<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to pharmaceutical 
agents and compounds which inhibit platelet aggregation 
in mammals. Fibrinogen is a glycoprotein present as a normal 
component of blood plasma. It participates in platelet 
aggregation and fibrin formation in the blood clotting 
mechanism. Platelets are cellular elements found in whole 
blood which also participate in blood coagulation. 
Fibrinogen binding to platelets is important to normal 
platelet function in the blood coagulation mechanism. 
When a blood vessel receives an injury, the platelets 
binding to fibrinogen will initiate aggregation and 
form a thrombus. Interaction of fibrinogen with 
platelets occurs through a membrane glycoprotein 
complex, known as gp IIb/IIIa; this is an important 
feature of the platelet function. Inhibitors of this 
interaction are useful in modulating platelet thrombus 
formation. It is also known that another large glycoprotein 
named fibronectin, which is a major extracellular 
matrix protein, interacts with fibrinogen and fibrin, 
and with other structural molecules such as actin, 
collagen and proteoglycans. Various relatively large 
polypeptide fragments in the cell-binding domain of 
fibronectin have been found to have cell-attachment 
activity. See U.S. Patents 4,517,686; 4,589,881; and 
4,661,111. Certain relatively short peptide fragments 
from the same molecule were found to promote cell 
attachment to a substrate when immobilized on the 
substrate or to inhibit attachment when in a  
 
solubilized or suspended form. See U.S. Patents 
4,578,079 and 4,614,517. In U.S. Patent 4,683,291, inhibition of platelet 
function is disclosed with synthetic peptides designed 
to be high affinity antagonists of fibrinogen binding 
to platelets. U.S. Patent 4,857,508 discloses 
tetrapeptides having utility as inhibitors of platelet 
aggregation. European Patent Application 445,796 discloses 
platelet aggregation inhibitors which contain peptide 
linkages, namely N-[N-[4 -(p-amidinobenzamido)butyryl]-L-α-aspartyl]valine 
compounds. The compounds inhibit 
cell-cell adhesion and the binding of adhesive proteins 
to platelets. European Patent Application 372,486 discloses N-acyl 
beta amino acid derivatives which are useful as 
cell adhesion inhibitors and are especially useful for 
inhibiting platelet aggregation. European Patent Application 381,033 discloses 
amidino or guanidinoaryl substituted alkanoic acid 
derivatives which inhibit protein to receptor binding 
and are useful for the treatment of thrombosis and 
cardia
