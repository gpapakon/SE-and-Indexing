<ABSTRACT>
A safelight filter for infrared-sensitive silver halide photographic elements, 
said safelight filter comprising in superimposition a dye filter layer which absorbs 

visible light up to a wavelength of about 470 nm, a dye filter layer which absorbs 
visible light and infrared radiation over the wavelength range of from about 530 to 

about 850 nm and a flexible, transparent reflective sheet material having on one 
surface thereof a transparent metal coating which reduces transmission of near 

infrared radiation. 
The safelight filter effectively reduce transmission in the visible portion of 
the spectrum (from about 380 to 760 nm) and the near infrared radiation (from 

about 760 to 1500 nm) and transmits light only in the wavelength range of from 
about 470 to about 530 nm, thus providing sufficient visible light for darkroom 

working combined with minimum photographic effects on the sensitive silver halide 
photographic element.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to photographic safelight filters and more particularly 
to photographic safelight filters suitable for use in the handling and processing of 
infrared-sensitive photographic elements in conjunction with safelight lamps. It is well known that silver halide photographic elements can be spectrally 
sensitized to infrared radiation. See Mees and James, The Theory of 
Photographic Processes, 3rd edition, The MacMillan Company, 1966, pages 198 
and 199. Silver halides are intrinsically sensitive only to light in the blue region of 
the spectrum. Therefore, when silver halides are to be exposed to other 
wavelengths of radiation, such as green light, red light or infrared radiation, a 
spectral sensitizing dye is required to render silver halides sensitive to such 
radiation. As known in the art, silver halides having adsorbed on the grains spectral 
sensitizing dyes are made sensitive to radiation of a wavelength other than the 
intrinsic blue sensitivity. There are numerous references to dye structures for 
infrared sensitizing dyes. Examples of patents describing such dyes are listed in 
US Pat. No. 4,011,083. With the advent of lasers, and in particular solid state laser diodes emitting 
in the infrared region of the spectrum (e.g., 750 to 1500 nm), the interest in infrared 
sensitive materials has greatly increased. Many different processes and articles 
useful for exposure to laser diodes have been proposed. These include C.A.T. 
(Computer Assisted Tomography) scanners, graphic arts products and infrared 
sensitive false color-sensitized photographic elements as described in US Pat. No. 
4,619,892. In this patent, photographic elements are described which are capable 
of providing full color images without exposure to corresponding visible radiation. 
These false address elements comprise at least three silver halide emulsion layers 
on a substrate, each associated with different photographic color image forming 
materials and sensitized to three different portions of the spectrum, with at least 
two layers sensitized to different regions of the infrared region of the spectrum.  For convenience in the handling and processing of infrared sensitive 
photographic elements, it is desirable to use a safelight source which emits light so 
there is sufficient visible light for handling and processing, yet cause a minimum 
level of fogging due to safelight lighting. However, the light emitted by the readily 
available safelight lamps used as light sources consists of a continuous spectrum
