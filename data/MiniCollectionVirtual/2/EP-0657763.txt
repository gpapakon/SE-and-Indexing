<ABSTRACT>
A liquid crystal display device (12) according to 
the present invention includes: a pair of substrates (16, 

17) opposing each other, a plurality of display device 
pixels being provided in a matrix shape on each of the 

pair of substrates; a liquid crystal layer (22) 
interposed between the pair of substrates (16, 17); and 

an orientation layer (21) for controlling an orientation 
state of liquid crystal molecules in the liquid crystal 

layer (22), the orientation layer (21) being formed on a 
surface of at least one of the substrates (16, 17) that 

opposes the liquid crystal layer (22). The orientation 
layer (21) is composed essentially of a polymer alloy. 

Since the polymer alloy in the orientation layer (21) has 
a phase separation structure, it becomes possible to 

obtain regularly-formed portions of liquid crystal, 
liquid crystal molecules in the portions being aligned 

either radially, bi-axially, or multi-axially, and it 
also becomes possible to control the sizes of such 

portions. As a result, such problems as contrast 
changes, coloration phenomena, and reversal phenomena of 

displayed images, which would occur due to the viewing 
angle dependence of the contrast with respect to the 

vertical and horizontal directions, are eliminated, 
thereby achieving high contrast and substantially no 

display unevenness.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a liquid crystal
display device, and in particular to a liquid crystal
display device having excellent viewing angle characteristics.Liquid crystal display devices incorporating
nematic liquid crystal display devices, in which a
nematic liquid crystal is interposed between a pair of
substrates, have conventionally been generally used for
numeral segment type display devices such as clocks and
calculators. Active switching elements such as TFTs
(Thin Film Transistors) are formed on a light transmitting
substrate so as to function as a switching means
for selectively driving pixel electrodes for applying a
driving voltage to the liquid crystal. On a counter
substrate provided so as to oppose the light transmitting
substrate, a plurality of minute color filter layers
having colored regions of red, green, and blue are
provided as passive elements of a color display means.Examples of such liquid crystal display devices,
as categorized based on the twist angle of the liquid
crystal, are: (a) active type, twisted nematic (hereinafter
referred to as "TN") liquid crystal display system in
which nematic liquid crystal molecules are aligned so as
to be twisted by 90°; and (b) multiplex type, super
twisted nematic (hereinafter referred to as "STN") liquid
crystal display system in which nematic liquid crystal
molecules having a twist angle of 90° or more are used so 
as to attain steep voltage-light transmittance characteristics,
(the voltage being applied to the liquid
crystal).In general, the active type TN liquid crystal
display system is further categorized into: (a-i) a
normally black system where a pair of polarizing plates
are disposed in such a manner that the polarizing directions
thereof are parallel to each other, so that a black
image is displayed when no voltage is applied to the
liquid crystal layer (i.e., in an OFF state); and
(a-ii) a normally white system where a pair of polarizing
plates are disposed in such a manner that the polarizing
directions thereof are perpendicular to each other, so
that a white image is displayed in an OFF state. Among
the two systems, the (a-ii) normally white system is
considered to be more promising in terms of color reproductivity
and viewing angle dependence of display.Figures 7A to 7C each show a cross section of a
conventional TN type liquid crystal display device 1.
The problems associated with a conventional TN type
liquid crystal display device will be described with
reference to Figures 7A to 7C.The display device 1 includes a
