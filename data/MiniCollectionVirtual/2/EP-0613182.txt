<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a high power capacity
optical receiver, comprising an optical transmission channel,
a opto-electric photodetector arranged at said optical transmission
channel to transduce a portion of an optical signal
propagating along said optical transmission channel into a
respective electrical signal, an electrical transmission line
with an electrical input connection from said photodetector
arranged at said electrical transmission line, and a capacitance
element arranged at said electrical transmission line to adjust
the speed at which said electrical signal propagates along said
electrical transmission line.The invention relates further to a method of transducing
an optical signal to an electrical signal, comprising
the steps of:
   tapping the optical signal at a location along an
optical transmission path, converting the tapped optical signal
into a respective electrical signal propagating along an
electrical transmission path, and matching the phase velocity
of the optical signal and the electrical signal.Such a receiver and such a method of transducing are
known from GB-A-2 253 480. This invention relates in general to optical receivers in which
an array of discrete photodetectors is employed to sense an
input optical signal.Microwave and millimeter wave photodetector receivers
are limited in their optical collection areas by the required
bandwidth of the system. This limitation stems from
the RC time constants of the photodiodes that are typically
used for optical reception, since the photodiode depletion
region capacitance is directly proportional to the area of
its p-n junction. Accordingly, the device area must be
scaled down as the desired operational frequency increases.
This, however, limits the amount of optical power that can
be converted to electrical current by the receiver before
the nonlinearity of the conversion process causes unacceptable
signal distortion, or the detector itself burns out.
Photodetector structures are well known and are described,
for example, in Wang, Introduction to Semiconductor Technology:
GaAs and Related Compounds, John Wiley & Sons,
1990, pages 482-486.A photodetection system that purports to achieve higher
power capabilities is described in Taylor et al., "Traveling
Wave Photodetectors", Optoelectronics Signal Processing
for Phased-Array Antennas II, SPIE Vol. 1217, 1990, 
pages 59-63. In this system an RF electrical transmission
line is used as the electrode of an elongated photodetector.
To obtain a velocity match between the RF
