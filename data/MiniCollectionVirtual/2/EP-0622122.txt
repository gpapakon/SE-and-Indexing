<CLAIMS>
Flotation cell with at least one injector (1) for delivering the suspension, in which 
the injector comprises a feed pipe (6) and the feed pipe (6) has a pipe section (9) 

with an air suction or feeder opening, characterised in that a multihole screen (2) 
is provided for drawing in air, whereby pipe sections (7) are arranged at a 

distance from the holes (3) of the screen, said distance being at least 0.1 times 
the hole diameter and at most 1.5 times the hole diameter and the sections being 

aligned essentially perpendicular to the screen (2) and exiting into a mixer pipe 
(6') or a mixer pipe section. 
Flotation cell according to claim 1, characterised in that a separate pipe section 
(7) is assigned to each hole (3) of the screen (2). 
Flotation cell according to claim 2, characterised in that the pipe sections (7) have 
an inside diameter of at least 1.05 times the diameter of the assigned hole, 

whereby the pipe sections and the holes are designed to be circular. 
Flotation cell according to one of claims 1 to 3, characterised in that the pipe 
section (9) is arranged below the screen (2) and has essentially the same exterior 

wall as the mixer pipe (6') and contains the pipe sections (7) of smaller diameter 
at least in their initial region assigned to the holes (3) of the screen (2). 
Flotation cell according to one of claims 1 to 4, characterised in that the pipe 
sections (7) of small diameter project at least 10 mm out of the air suction section 

(9). 
Flotation cell according to one of claims 1 to 5, characterised in that the holes (3) 
of the screen (2) are arranged distributed evenly in a ring over the screen, if 

necessary with a central additional hole.
