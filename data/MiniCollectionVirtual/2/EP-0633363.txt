Rain water collecting tank (1) with a rain water 
inlet (2) and a removal point (5) connected thereto, 

its interior being subdivided by means of a 
partition (4) into two chambers (I, II) of which the 

first (I) is connected to said rain water inlet 
while the second (II) is connected both to said 

removal point (5) and to a fresh water feeding means 
(10), 
characterized in that
 the 
vertical partition (4) separates only the lower 

regions of the two chambers (I, II) whereas the 
upper regions of the two chambers remain interconnected. 
Tank as set forth in claim 1, 
characterized 
in that
 a non-return valve (13) is 
arranged in said partition (4) to allow water to 

flow from the first chamber (I) to the second 
chamber (II) only. 
Tank as set forth in any of claims 1 or 2, 
characterized 
in that
 the size of said 
first chamber (I) is several times the size of said 

second chamber (II) 
Tank as set forth in any of the preceding claims, 

characterized in that
 a plurality 
of additional tanks (1a - 1d) is connected to said 

tank (1), and particularly above said rain water 
inlet (2), with at least one of said additional 

tanks comprising a rain water inlet (2).  
 
Tank as set forth in claim 4, 
characterized
 
in that said connection comprises a non-return 

flap (18). 
Tank as set forth in any of claims 4 or 5, 
characterized 
in that
 said additional 
tanks (1a - 1d) are connected to said first tank (1) 

on both sides thereof. 
Tank as set forth in any of the preceding claims, 

characterized in that
 a pump (7) 
is connected to said removal point (5) and is 

located in a recess (17) provided in said tank. 
Tank as set forth in claim 7, 
characterized 
in that
 a sensor (12), and particularly 
a float, is arranged in said second chamber 

(II) so as to ensure a fresh water replenishment 
when the water level in the second chamber (II) has 

reached its minimum.
