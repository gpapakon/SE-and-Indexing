<ABSTRACT>
A two part lower tie plate assembly is disclosed for use with a fuel bundle 
of a boiling water nuclear reactor. The two parts include a rod supporting 

grid section (G) and nozzle section (N). Both the rod supporting grid section 
(G) and the nozzle section (N) are constructed asymmetrically. The rod 

supporting grid section (G) contains one half of the total offset required 
for a D lattice lower tie plate and the nozzle section (N) contain
s one half 
of the total offset required for a D lattice lower tie plate. When a D lattice 

lower tie plate is required, assembly occurs so that the offsets are 
additive. When a C lattice lower tie plate is required, assembly occurs so 

that the offsets are subtractive. Assembly of the lower tie plate is provided 
be either bolting or welding. There results one single rod supporting grid 

and one nozzle section capable of assembly to fit either a C or a D lattice.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to fuel bundles for boiling 
water nuclear reactors. More particularly, this invention 
discloses a two part lower tie plate for supporting the fuel 
bundle on the fuel support casting, this particular tie plate 
having the ability to be assembled to accommodate either a so-called 
"D" or a "C" lattice. This invention relates to lower tie plates for 
nuclear fuel bundles. In order to understand this invention, 
the construction of a nuclear fuel bundle will be first 
summarized. Thereafter, the support of fuel bundles on the 
fuel support casting interior of a nuclear reactor will be set 
forth. Finally, the difference between the so-called "D" and 
"C" lattices will be discussed -- emphasizing the "D" lattice 
mounting as non-symmetrical and the "C" lattice mounting as 
symmetrical. This summary will set the background required to 
understand the subject two part tie plate construction which 
can accommodate both "D" and "C" lattices. For purposes of this invention, the construction of 
a nuclear fuel bundle can be easily summarized. It includes a 
lower tie plate supporting an upstanding, vertical, side-by-side 
array of sealed fuel rods at a rod supporting grid. This 
lower tie plate functions to admit moderating water coolant 
into the fuel bundle. The vertical fuel rods are bound in side-by-side 
relationship by so-called fuel rod spacers with the bundle 
terminating in an upper tie plate. This upper tie plate 
allows the water moderator and generated steam to escape from 
the fuel bundle. Additionally, using certain of the fuel rods 
also referred to as "tie rods", the upper and lower tie plates 
are held together making the fuel bundle a unitary assembly 
which can be moved to and from locations in the reactor.  Finally, the fuel bundle is surrounded by a fuel 
bundle channel which extends from the vicinity of the lower 
tie plate to the vicinity of the upper tie plate. This 
channel assures that the two phase flow of water and steam 
through the fuel bundle is separated from the so-called 
surrounding "core bypass" region which is normally filled with 
water. This same core bypass region is the region in which 
the so-called "control rods" pass to absorb neutrons and 
control the nuclear reaction within the fuel rods. Having summarized fuel bundle construction, a 
simplified explanation of the support of the fuel bundles may 
now be offered. Fuel bundles interior of a nuclear reactor are 
supported in groups of four on fuel support castings. Such 
support occurs at each
