<ABSTRACT>
This luminair (light fitting) intended for a lamp (2) of linear type mounted fixed in a main reflector section (1) is provided with a screen section (3) made, for example, by assembling prisms, each one of which is parallel to the longitudinal direction of the section, with means (5) allowing this screen to be rotated about an axis (7) parallel to the longitudinal direction of the section. The reflector (1) can also turn about a longitudinal axis. Applications: illumination of a work surface or of horizontally or vertically oriented objects.

<CLAIMS>
A luminaire for a linear type of lamp (2) mounted in fixed position,
having a reflector section (1) and having at least a screen section (3, 8) of a type

deviating light sideways, movably placed in the luminous flux of the lamp around an
axis of rotation parallel with its longitudinal direction and having a dimension and a

position so that it may intercept part of the luminous flux reflected by the reflector
section, characterized in that the reflector section, called main reflector, which has a

focal axis (7), is positioned such that the lamp is placed substantially on this focal axis,
the axis of rotation of the screen section (3, 8) substantially coinciding with this focal

axis.
A luminaire as claimed in claim 1, characterized in that the screen section
(3) is transparent and is formed by an assembly of elementary prisms of which each one

is parallel with the longitudinal direction of the section.
A luminaire as claimed in claim 1, characterized in that the screen section
(3) is a wall formed by elementary prisms arranged side by side, of which each one is

parallel with the longitudinal direction of the section and of which the surface receiving
the light is treated as a mirror.
A luminaire as claimed in claim 1, characterized in that the screen section
(8) is formed by a louver with lamellae (9) which are parallel with the longitudinal

direction of the main reflector, which lamellae are inclined relative to a plane passing
through the axis of rotation of the louver.
A luminaire as claimed in the preceding claim, characterized in that the
surface of the lamellae (9) of the louver which receives the light is treated as a mirror.
A luminaire as claimed in any one of the preceding claims, characterized
in that the segment of the screen section (3, 8) is a circular arc whose center is situated

substantially on its axis of rotation.
A luminaire as claimed in any one of the preceding claims, characterized
in that the main reflector (1) is also movable around an axis parallel with its own

longitudinal direction.
A luminaire as claimed in the preceding claim, comprising a housing (13),
characterized in that it further includes a closing section (11) parallel with the

longitudinal direction of the main reflector (1), to close a possible gap (12) between the 
main reflector and the housing, and turning means (10) for turning this closing section

around an axis that coincides with the axis of rotation (7) of the screen section, said
closing section having a transversal circular arc segment whose center is situated on the

axis of rotation.
