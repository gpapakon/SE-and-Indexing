<ABSTRACT>
A machine for processing solid and viscous 
plastic materials includes a screw element (32) having a 

shearing flight (90) and a scraping flight (75). Upon 
rotation of the screw, the shearing flight (90) shears 

the plastic material (89) and the scraping flight (75) 
guides the material (89) to the shearing flight (90). 

Preferably, the screw includes a plurality of threads 
which extend from one end of the screw to the other, and 

which include a plurality of shearing and scraping 
flights.

<DESCRIPTION>
Some of the most difficult mixing or
compounding jobs are those that involve dispersion of
solids in a viscous matrix such as a fluid polymeric
material. For example, in compounding rubber for tires
and other applications, carbon black is dispersed into a
rubber matrix. Similarly, the dispersion of inorganic
and organic pigments as well as many other solid
additives into plastics is another common practice in
the compounding field.Successful compounding generally requires both
dispersive mixing and extensive mixing. One manner of
accomplishing successful dispersive mixing is to expose
the fluid elements containing the solids to high shear
stresses in order to rupture the solids into fragments.
Presently available mixers generate such stresses by
passing material to be compounded through narrow gap
regions in the mixer, thus creating high shear rates.
Multiple passes of the same material through the narrow
gap regions is desired in order to reduce the size of
the agglomerates to acceptable levels.Extensive mixing involves mixing various
portions of the matrix with one another. Thus, after the
ruptured solid particles and surrounding matrix pass
through the narrow gap region, this part of the matrix
must be mixed back into the rest of the matrix for
composition uniformity.Many commercial mixers include narrow gap
regions for dispersive mixing. For example, the narrow
gap region is present in the nip of a roll mill mixer,
in the gap between the tip of a Banbury type rotor and
wall, in the gap between the tip of the kneading element
and the barrel in an intermeshing twin screw extruder,
and in the clearance between the mixing pin and the disk
in a corotating disk processor. While these commercial
mixers are effective in dispersive mixing, they are
quite expensive and complex compared to single screw
extruders. Screw type processing equipment such as single
screw extruders are the most popular continuous
processors of plastics and rubber. Such extruders have
numerous desirable features including simplicity,
relatively low cost, high throughput and versatility.
However, application of single screw extruders and other
similar processing equipment in the field of
compounding has been rather limited. Although single
screw extruders can be designed to provide good
extensive mixing, they generally provide poor dispersive
mixing. Only a small fraction of the processed material
ever experiences high stresses in narrow gap regions or
flight clearances between the flights of the screw and
the barrel. Only a negligible
