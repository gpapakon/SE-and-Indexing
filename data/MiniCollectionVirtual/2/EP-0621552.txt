<ABSTRACT>
An automatic script-determining apparatus automatically determines the gross 
script-type of the text image of a document. A connected component generating means (28) 

generates connected components from the pixels comprising the text image. A bounding box 
generating means (30) generates a bounding box surrounding each connected component. A 

centroid determining means (32) determines a centroid for each bounding box. A script 
feature determining means (34) determines the locations, relative to the centroid, of one or 

more predetermined types of features, for each bounding box. A script determining means 
(36) determines a distribution of the located script features for the entire text image, and 

compares the determined spatial distribution to predetermined distribution for at least one 
script-type to determine the script type of the text image.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method and
apparatus for automatic document recognition and, more
particularly, to a method and apparatus for automatically
determining the character script type(s) of the characters
of the document.Optical character recognition and the use of optical
character recognition to convert scanned image data into
text data suitable for use in a digital computer is well
known. In addition, methods for converting scanned image
data into text data and the types of errors such methods
generate are well known. However, the proper selection of
the character recognition method is highly dependent upon
the script (alphabet or ideogram) used in the document.
Further, the selection of a proper method for error
correction is highly dependent upon the language of the
document. Conventionally, the methods for optical
character recognition and for error correction in optical
character recognition systems have been provided on the
assumption that the script and language used in the
document is the "official" script and language of the
country in which the system is being used. That is, in the
United States, conventional optical character recognition
systems would assume that the document is in English and
uses Roman script, while in Japan, an applicable character
recognition system would be implemented assuming that the
language is Japanese and uses the Japanese scripts.
Alternately, an optical character recognition system can be
implemented with the character recognition and error
resolution methods for a plurality of languages.However, it has heretofore not been possible to have
the optical character recognition system automatically
determine the language of the document. Rather, as each
document is provided to the optical character recognition
system, some indication of the particular language and
script of the document must be given to the optical
character recognition system. This has been accomplished 
by either having the operator input data concerning the
language and script of the document to the optical
character recognition system, or by having the document
provided with special markings which indicate the language
and script of the document.Patent Abstracts of Japan, vol. 017, no. 335 (P-1563),
24 June 1993 and JP-A-05 040846 (Oki Electric Ind Co Ltd),
19 February 1993, discloses a system that achieves
automated determination of the script-type of the text
portion of a document image.EP-A-0288266 discloses a system that achieves the
automatic discrimination of machine-printed
