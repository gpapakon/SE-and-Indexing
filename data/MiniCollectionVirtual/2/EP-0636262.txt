<ABSTRACT>
A process and apparatus for identifying a target section within an image of a meat section (12). Colour data for each pixel is stored and the pixels having a predetermined colour characteristic of the target section e.g. a certain red/green ratio, are discriminated. The process involves excising from a refined data set for the discriminated pixels at least one data set for a cluster of pixels representing an external image section which is adjacent to and contacting the target section but which does not form part of the target section, the excising step including analysing the shape of the refined image section represented by the refined data set to identify concavities and examining properties of links and/or properties of sub-sections formed by links to identify valid links demarcating the target section from adjacent touching external image sections. The refined data set after the excising step has been carried out is processed as the data set representing the target section of the image.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates image analysis to locate a target
section in an image. The invention has been developed for use in
evaluation of meat quality parameters, particularly utilising
contact-free determination, but the invention has wider application
than this field alone.In the meat industry it is becoming increasingly important for
meat products to be accurately described to ensure that the correct
products are directed to spectific markets, maximum returns are
gained for the different products and products can be changed over
time to suit the requirements of the market. This is particularly so
in the meat processing section of the industry which operates between
the producers (farmers) and wholesale or retail consumers who
purchase either whole carcases or boned-out cuts of meat in cartons.
The requirements of the consumers (in various markets such as
Australia, Japan, USA, Korea, EEC etc) are varied, with the potential
for both large premiums and also heavy discounts for providing either
the correct or wrong products respectively.In the USA and Japan, for example, centrally controlled grading
schemes have evolved to cater for this requirement by inspecting the
carcases in the abattoir and assigning an overall grade to the meat
products in the carcase which is based on several individual
characteristics. The grading is based on an expert assessment of a
cross section cut through the carcase at a specified site, usually
between two particular ribs. This cut exposes several muscles, in
particular the longissimus dorsi or ribeye muscle which is one of the
more valuable portions of meat in the carcase, as well as
intermuscular fat deposits, a cross section of the subcutaneous fat
layer and any bones/ribs that may be present. Both US and Japanese
grading schemes attach great significance in the grading schemes to
the level of intramuscular fat contained within the ribeye
(marbling), the colour of the ribeye muscle, the area of the ribeye
and the colour of the intermuscular fat surrounding the muscles.
These are all important quality measures although the ribeye area,
intermuscular fat and subcutaneous fat thickness can also be used as 
a quantitative measure of the carcase by predicting the relative
amount of meat in the whole carcase (ie lean meat yield %). In the
US system the carcase is assigned a marbling category (slight,
abundant, etc) based on comparison to a set of photographs published
by the US Department of Agriculture (USDA), who are also responsible
for training all graders within the
