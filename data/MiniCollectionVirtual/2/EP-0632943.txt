<ABSTRACT>
Method of eliminating repetitive interfering signals from a sampled input signal by subtracting the interfering signal. The method comprises the steps of defining, for each sample in one period of the interference of the input signal, a sample value in an interfering signal pulse, the number of samples in the interfering signal pulse corresponding to the number of samples in one period of the interference of the input signal; detecting that a new period of the interference of the input signal has been initiated; subtracting the sample values of the interfering signal pulse from the corresponding sample values of the input signal; modifying the sample values of the interfering signal pulse on the basis of the sample values of the input signal, thereby adaptively adjusting the interfering signal pulse to the present appearance of the interference; repeating the subtraction and the modification, until it is detected that a new period of the interference of the input signal has been initiated, or until the entire interfering signal pulse has been passed.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method of
eliminating repetitive interfering signals from a sampled
input signal by subtracting the interfering signal.In all measuring and signal processing situations,
interfering signals constitute a more or less serious
problem.In many cases, this problem can be solved by ordinary,
linear band stop filtration. However,this is not
possible if the interesting signal and the interfering
signal have frequency components in the same frequency
range, for example if the interesting signal has frequency
components around 50 Hz and the interference originates
from the mains in the form of a mains frequency interference.
Medical signals such as ECG, EEG, etc., are typical
examples of such signals.Document DE-A-3 517 113, constituting the closest prior
art, describes a system for suppression of interference
caused by the mains supply.A different method of eliminating interfering signals
is to simply subtract the interfering signal from the
interfered signal. There are prior art methods using this
principle, but to make them function, the appearance of
the interfering signal must be known. In the example with
mains frequency interference, it must therefore be assumed
that the frequency is stable. Only perfectly sinusoidal
signals can be eliminated by such a method. Even if the
interfering signal is supplied directly from the wall
socket, the result after subtraction will not be satisfactory,
since the mains interference is not perfectly
sinusoidal. On the one hand, the frequency varies slightly
and, on the other hand, and this is the biggest problem,
e.g. thyristor controls and motors interfere the signal
such that, in addition to the frequency 50 Hz, it will
also contain overtones. To eliminate the harmonics, one
more system for each harmonic must be available, and the
appearance of the harmonic must be known. The object of the present invention is to provide a
method of eliminating interfering signals, in which the
appearance of the interfering signal need not be known.The method mentioned by way of introduction is
characterised by the steps of
defining, for each sample in one period of the interference
of the input signal, a sample value in an interfering
signal pulse, the number of samples in the interfering
signal pulse corresponding to the number of samples
in one period of the interference of the input signal;detecting that a new period of the interference of
the input signal has been initiated;subtracting the sample values of the interfering
signal pulse from the

signal; and that the determination of the phase position

of the interfering signal is effected by measuring the

time from the beginning of a new period of the interference
until a new sample of the input signal is taken.
