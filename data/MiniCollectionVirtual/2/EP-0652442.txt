<ABSTRACT>
A device for testing an electrical line by time domain reflectometry, comprises: 

( i) a pulse generator (1) for generating a series of test pulses; 
(ii) a programmable delay generator (2) which provides a delay in transmission 
of the test pulses before they are transmitted to the line; and 
(iii) an analogue-to-digital converter (4) which samples reflected signals from 
the line, digital sample values produced thereby being sent to a memory; 
the arrangement being such that, in use, he line is tested in a test sequence in which: 

(a) a test pulse is transmitted to the line and a number of digital sample values 
are produced sequentially at a defined sampling rate; 
(b) the delay generator (2) is incremented or decremented to retard or advance 
transmission of the test pulse to the line by 1/n times the sampling period 

(where n is an integer greater than one); 
(c) steps (a) and (b) are repeated until transmission of the test pulse has been 
retarded or advanced by at least (n-1)/n times the sampling period and 

sample values from each pulse obtained; and 
(d) the sample values are rearranged in order of increasing time difference 
between transmission of the test pulse and sampling, and are displayed. 
The device has the advantage that the spatial resolution of the device is not 
limited by the A/D conversion time or the clock frequency but simply by the 

minimum delay increment of the delay generator.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to devices for testing electrical lines, for example 
telephone lines, LANs, CATV lines and the like, for faults by time domain 
reflectometry (TDR). TDR is a well known technique for testing lines in which, for example, one 
or more electrical test pulses are transmitted into the line at one end thereof, and the 
voltage on the line at the same end thereof is measured as a function of time after 
transmission of the test pulse. Any impedance mismatch in the line or at the 
termination of the other end of the line caused for example by a fault, will cause a 
reflection of the test pulse to be detected at a time after transmission of the test 
pulse that corresponds to the position of the impedance mismatch along the line. It is an object of the present invention to provide an improved device of this 
type, and especially one which is able to resolve the position of an impedance 
mismatch in the line to be tested to a relatively short distance. According to the present invention, there is provided a device for testing an 
electrical line by time domain reflectometry, which comprises: 
( i) a pulse generator for generating a series of test pulses; (ii) a programmable delay generator which provides a delay in transmission of 
the test pulses to the line; and  (iii) an analogue-to-digital converter which samples reflected signals from the 
line, digital sample values produced thereby being sent to a memory; the arrangement being such that, in use, the line is tested in a test sequence in 
which: 
(a) a test pulse is transmitted to the line and a number of digital sample values 
are produced sequentially at a defined sampling rate; (b) the delay generator is incremented or decremented to retard or advance 
transmission of the test pulse to the line by 1/n times the sampling period 
(where n is an integer greater than one); (c) steps (a) and (b) are repeated until transmission of the test pulse has been 
retarded or advanced by at least (n-1)/n times the sampling period and 
sample values from each pulse obtained; and (d) the sample values are rearranged in order of increasing time difference 
between transmission of the test pulse and sampling, and are displayed. The device according to the invention has the advantage that not only is the 
minimum increment of time between the test pulse and sampling, and hence the 
spatial resulution of the device, not limited by the time taken for the A/D 
conversion, but it is not even limited by the clock frequency of any clock used for 
timing of
