<ABSTRACT>
Underneath a worktop (11) which receives a cooking hob (12) there is provided a baking oven (1) having a vapour outlet opening (7) which is connected, in terms of flow, to an outgoing-air opening (17) in the cooking hob (12) or in the worktop (11). According to the invention, the outgoing-air opening (17) is connected to a low-pressure source, e.g. equipped with a suction fan (19), and arranged at a clear distance from the vapour outlet opening (7) and/or from flow channels (20, 21, 22) running around the oven muffle (4) of the baking oven (1), with the result that the heated outgoing air from the entire installation space is centrally drawn in and carried away.

<CLAIMS>
Arrangement with a built-in oven and a cooking field (12) and/or a workplate (11),
which built-in oven comprises a baking oven (1) with an oven muffle (4) possessing a fume

outlet opening (7) and is arranged under the cooking field and/or the workplate, which
have an air exhaust opening (17) to which a source (19) of underpressure is connected,

characterised thereby that the air exhaust opening (17) is arranged at a clear spacing from
the flow channels (20, 21, 22) running around the oven muffle 4.
Arrangement according to claim 1, characterised thereby that the air exhaust
opening (17) is arranged at a clear spacing from the fume outlet opening (7).
Arrangement according to claim 1 or 2, characterised thereby that a suction fan
(19) is arranged in the air exhaust opening (17).
Arrangement according to one of the preceding claims, characterised thereby that
an oven housing (2) surrounding the oven muffle (4) has flow openings (23) which face or

adjoin the air exhaust opening (17) and are connected in terms of flow with the flow
channels (20, 21, 22) running around the oven muffle (4).
Arrangement according to claim 4, characterised thereby that the fume outlet
opening (7) is connected with a flow opening (9) in the oven housing (2) by a fume channel

(8).
Arrangement according to one of the preceding claims, characterised thereby that
the source of underpressure (19) can be activated by a control device which is in turn

connected with a sensor device detecting the moisture and/or the temperature of the
vapour.
