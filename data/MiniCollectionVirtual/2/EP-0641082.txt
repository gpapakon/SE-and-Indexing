<ABSTRACT>
According to an output from a voltage-controlled 
oscillator (1), there are generated by a fractional divider (2) a 

high-frequency division signal (S1) and a low-frequency division 
number (S2). A phase comparison is conducted betwen the high-frequency 

division signal (S1) and a high-frequency reference 
signal (REF1) by a phase comparator (5). A phase comparison is 

carried out between the low-frequency division signal (S2) and 
a low-frequency reference signal (REF2) by a phase comparator (6). 

Either one of the outputs from the phase comparators (5 and 6) 
is selected by a selector (7) to be fed to a filter (8), thereby 

producing a control voltage (Vc) for the voltage-controlled 
oscillator (1). A high-resolution division is achieved by the 

fractional division; consequently, disturbance of the 
oscillation frequency due to a change-over of the selector (7) 

is suppressed. There is obtained a PLL frequency synthesizer 
developing a high-speed lock-up and a highly stable 

oscillation.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a phase-locked loop 
(PLL) frequency synthesizer and a PLL frequency synthesizing 
method, and in particular, to a PLL frequency synthesizer and 
a PLL frequency synthesizing method capable of obtaining a 
high-speed lock-up and a highly-reliable oscillation. Heretofore, a minimized lock-up time and a highly 
stable oscillation have been desired as characteristics of 
the PLL frequency synthesizer. The lock-up time minimization 
means reduction of a period of time required to develop a 
reference frequency, whereas the highly stable oscillation 
indicates strength against external disturbances. As well 
known, a high-speed characteristic of the lock-up time is 
attained when controlled by a higher comparison frequency. On 
the other hand, the oscillation is stabilized much easier 
when controlled by a lower comparison frequency. For an efficient use of these conflicting 
advantageous features, there have been known PLL frequency 
synthesizers utilizing a reference frequency and comparison 
frequencies obtained through divisions by a larger divisor and 
a smaller divisor (reference is to be made, e.g., to the 
Japanese Patent Laid-Open Publication No. 2-94710 and Japanese 
Patent Laid-Open Publication No. 3-38921). According to the 
conventional technologies, a phase-locked loop is configured 
by a reference frequency and comparison frequencies obtained  
 
through divisions by a larger divisor and a smaller divisor. 
That is, a higher comparison frequency and an ordinary 
comparison frequency are used according to the magnitude of 
the difference between a target frequency and a current 
oscillation frequency. Specifically, for a large difference 
therebetween, a phase comparison is conducted in a state of a 
high frequency obtained by division by a small divisor so as 
to increase the speed of convergence onto the target 
frequency. After the oscillation frequency is thus led to a 
value near the target frequency in this state, when the 
frequency discrepancy is resultantly minimized, there is 
accomplished a phase comparison in a state of a lower 
comparison frequency obtained through division by a large 
divisor, namely, with the ordinary comparison frequency, 
thereby obtaining the target frequency with a high 
reliability. However, when the comparison frequency is increased 
as described above, the setting frequency only reaches a 
value near the target frequency. As shown in the lock-up 
characteristic of Fig. 1, deviation Δf takes place for the 
setting frequency
