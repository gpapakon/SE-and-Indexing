A process for preparing 4-alkyl-3-chloroalkylsulfonylbenzenes 
of the formula (1) 


 
in which R
1
 and R
2
 are identical or different and 
are each (C
1
-C
4
)-alkyl, by chlorinating a p-alkylbenzenesulfonyl 
chloride of the formula (2) 


 
in which R
1
 is as defined above, with at least 1 mol 
of chlorine in the presence of a chlorine transferrer 

at temperatures from about 50 to about 100°C to 
form a compound of the formula (3)  

 

 
in which R
1
 is as defined above, subsequently 
reducing this compound in aqueous medium with sodium 

bisulfite or sodium sulfite at temperatures from 
about 40 to about 90°C to a compound of the formula 

(4) 

 
in which R
1
 is as defined above, and condensing this 
compound with an α-halocarboxylic acid of the 

formula (5) 

 
in which R is hydrogen or (C
1
-C
3
)-alkyl and X is 
bromine or chlorine, or a salt thereof, to form a 

4-alkyl-3-chlorobenzenesulfonylcarboxylic acid of 
the formula (6), in which R
1
 and R are as defined 
above, or a salt thereof  

 

 
and subsequently decarboxylating it by heating. 
The process as claimed in claim 1, wherein the 
chlorination is carried out at temperatures from 60 

to 90°C, preferably from 70 to 80°C. 
The process as claimed in claim 1 or 2, wherein the 
chlorine transferrer used is iron(III) chloride or 

iron(III) chloride and iodine. 
The process as claimed in one or more of claims 1 to 
3, wherein the reduction is carried out with sodium 

bisulfite or sodium sulfite at temperatures from 40 
to 90°C, preferably from 50 to 65°C, at a pH from 8 

to 10. 
The process as claimed in one or more of claims 1 to 
4, wherein from 1 to 1.2 mol, preferably from 1.08 

to 1.15 mol, of sodium bisulfite or sodium sulfite 
are used. 
The process as claimed in one or more of claims 1 to 
5, wherein the reaction is carried out with from 1 

to 1.5 mol, preferably from 1.1 to 1.30 mol, of an 
α-halocarboxylic acid or a salt thereof. 
The process as claimed in claim 6, wherein the 
α-halocarboxylic acid is an α-chlorocarboxylic acid. 
The process as claimed in one or more of claims 1 to
