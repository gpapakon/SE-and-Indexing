<ABSTRACT>
A supercharged internal combustion engine with an exhaust driven turbo compressor 
(4,5) and a mechanically driven compressor (11), the pressure side of which is 

connected to the suction side of the turbo compressor. A conduit (18) for recirculation 
of exhaust opens into an ejector device (23,24) in a bypass conduit (17a,17b), which 

branches downstream of the turbo compressor from an intake conduit (15) provided 
with a damper (16).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a supercharged internal combustion engine, comprising a 
charging device in the form of an exhaust driven turbo compressor and a mechanically 
driven compressor. It is a known fact that a turbocharged diesel engine with high mean pressure always has 
the disadvantage that its low rpm torque is low. In order to obtain high power, the turbo 
unit must be optimized towards high charge pressure in the high rpm range, which has 
the result that the charge pressure will be relatively low in the lower rpm range, since 
the available exhause energy within this range is often insufficient to drive the turbo 
unit. It is known by SE-A-467269 in marine applications to compensate the relatively poor 
charge pressure of a turbo compressor at low rpms with a mechanically driven 
compressor, which is coupled in series with the turbo compressor, so that the pressure 
side of the mechanical compressor is coupled to the suction side of the turbo 
compressor. This produces a charge pressure on the pressure side of the turbo 
compressor, which is the product of the charge pressure ratio of the compressors. The 
solution makes it possible to optimize the charge pressure with simple means for both 
the high rpm range and the low and medium rpm ranges to thus provide a supercharged 
diesel engine which is particularly suitable for heavy planing boats and which provides 
high proportion even in the lower rpm range, within which the boat is to pass its planing 
threshold. In the boat motors of the type in question, up to now the problem has not been solved of 
recirculating exhaust at low load primarily in order to reduce NOX emissions. It is known by US-A-3 149 454, in a dual fuel combustion engine in a gas fuel 
operation mode, to by-pass an exhaust gas turbine and introduce the exhaust gases into 
the intake air pipe on the pressure side of a turbo-charger. In order to obtain a pressure 
drop at the point of introduction a venturi nozzle is interposed in the intake air pipe. 
This arrangement has the advantage that the combustion process in the partial-load  
 
range is advantageously influenced. However, the purpose of the arrangement is not to 
reduce NOX emissions in a twin supercharger diesel engine at primarily low load. The purpose of the present invention is to develop a supercharged internal combustion 
engine of the type described by way of introduction which makes possible recirculation 
of exhaust to reduce NOX emissions during operating conditions, when the intake air 
pressure in
