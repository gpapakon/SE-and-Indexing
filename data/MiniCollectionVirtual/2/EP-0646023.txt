<ABSTRACT>
An apparatus (20; 200) for handling a patient's blood during a first medical use which is convertible for a second medical use comprises a first block (26, 220) for adapting a reservoir (24; 206) for use during one medical use and a second block (28, 218) for adapting the reservoir (24; 206) for another medical use other than the first medical use. A lever (110; 203) pivotally mounted on the apparatus (20; 200) engages at least one of the blocks (26, 220) so that pivoting the lever (110; 203) causes the blocks (26 and 28; 218, 220) to move, moving the first block (26; 220) out of its operative position and moving the second block (28; 218) into its operative position. A lock (126a and 126b) for the lever (110) locks the blocks (26 and 28; 218 and 220) in place, and a valve mechanism (202) automatically selects a proper outlet (208 or 210).

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a quick-changeover 
blood handling apparatus, and in particular to an 
apparatus for handling a patient's blood for one medical 
application which is convertible for use in a second 
application. There are instances where one blood handling 
device would be used for a patient during a medical 
procedure, and another blood handling or collecting device 
would be needed for post-procedure care. For example, in 
the case of heart surgery, a blood reservoir is used as 
part of the blood recovery and oxygenation system. After 
the procedure, a separate autotransfusion reservoir might 
be used to collect the patient's blood from the surgical 
wound for re-use, and/or another reservoir might simply be 
used to collect blood drained from the surgical wound for 
disposal. Several "convertible" devices are available that 
can be used both as a blood reservoir during surgery and a 
pleural drainage unit after surgery. These devices 
provide several advantages: they eliminate the need for 
dedicated pleural drainage devices; they minimize the 
amount of disposable equipment that is used (and must be 
disposed of); they are more economical; and they reduce 
staff time associated with setting up multiple devices. 
Moreover, many of these devices allow for autotransfusion 
of the collected blood, reducing risk to the patient and 
reducing the demand for blood products. However, to varying degrees these devices have 
also suffered from one significant draw-back: the 
conversion of these devices from use as a surgical blood 
reservoir to a drainage unit or to an autotransfusion 
device is time consuming and complex. Many of these 
devices come with pages of detailed instructions that the 
nursing staff is expected to follow to properly disconnect 
and cap the numerous connectors required for use as a  
 
surgical blood reservoir. Some of these devices even 
require special kits, with further instructions and 
additional parts that must be set aside and later 
installed, to make the conversion. This increases the 
pressure on the nursing staff to quickly and accurately 
make the conversion. Furthermore, each tube connection 
that must be undone and capped increases the chance of 
blood splattering the medical staff, with the attendant 
risk of spreading disease, such as hepatitis and AIDS. The inventor's prior PCT Publication No. 
WO 91/13640 and U.S. Patent No. 5,149,318 disclose 
apparatus for handling a patient's blood during a medical 
procedure which can be quickly and easily converted for
