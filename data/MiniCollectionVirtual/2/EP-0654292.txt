<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates generally to a
bubble separating apparatus for removing bubbles contained
in a liquid, such as lubricants, surface active agents,
polymer containing liquid, coatings and so forth. More
specifically, the invention relates to a bubble separating
apparatus which can effectively remove even fine bubbles by
a vortical flow created by utilizing the flow of the liquid
perse.Fine bubbles dispersed in a liquid are known to
influence the natural properties or the inherent performance
of the liquid or to be a factor which promotes oxidation of
the liquid.For example, engine oils, turbine oils, hydraulic
oils and so forth, may contain a large amount of fine
bubbles generated due to agitation, circulation, abrupt
pressure variation and the like. The amount of fine
bubbles contained in the liquid increases according to
technological progress in the fields of engines, turbines,
hydraulic equipment achieving higher speeds and greater
output. A large amount of fine bubbles contained in the
lubricants tend to cause vibration or abnormal noise in a
supply pump, wearing of the vibrating portion, lowering of
working pressure and/or working efficiency due to a drop in
the hydraulic pressure and so forth. Furthermore,
increased contact area between the liquid and the fine
bubbles promotes degradation of the liquid due to oxidation.In the case of coatings, the fine bubbles
contained in the coating may adhere to the surface on which
a coating layer is to be formed, preventing the coating from
being applied thereto and causing irregularity or other
defects in the coating layer.Therefore, it is desired to remove bubbles from 
liquids effectively.An example of a typical bubble separating
apparatus is an apparatus which utilizes the flow of the
liquid pressurized by a pump to generate a vortical flow of
the liquid to concentrate bubbles at the center portion of
the vortical flow due to centrifugal force and whereby
efficiently and certainly remove bubbles from the liquid.
Commonly owned Japanese Unexamined Patent Publication
(Kokai) No. 3-123605 discloses such a type of bubble
separating apparatus. The construction of the prior
proposed bubble separating apparatus disclosed in the above-identified
publication will be discussed briefly with
reference to Figure 1.In Figure 1, a vortical flow chamber 2 is defined
by a parabola-shaped container 1 having opposite closed
ends. In the illustrated example, the parabola-shaped
container 1 is arranged vertically with the larger diameter
end at the upper side.
