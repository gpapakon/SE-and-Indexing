<ABSTRACT>
Process for preparing a radionuclide generator for producing Tc-99m or Re-188. A clear solution containing a metallic cation and an anion comprising W-188 or Mo-99 is provided. The metallic cation is present in the solution as a dissolved complex of the metallic cation and a complexing agent and/or the anion being present in the solution as a dissolved complex of the anion and a complexing agent. The dissolved complex(es) are decomposed to form a slurry containing a precipitate of the metallic cation and the anion. The precipitate is transferred to an elutable container of a radionuclide generator.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to tungsten-188/rhenium-188
and molybdenum-99/technetium-99m generators,
and more particularly to a process for their preparation.Technetium-99m and rhenium-188 are important
radionuclides, used in diagnostic and therapeutic
applications in hospitals and other establishments.
Several generators which separate the daughter
radionuclide, technetium-99m, from its parent
radionuclide, molybdenum-99, and the daughter
radionuclide, rhenium-188, from its parent radionuclide,
tungsten-188, have been described in the literature and/or
have been commercially available.Chromatographic generators, such as those used
to produce Tc-99m from Mo-99, typically contain
insolubilized parent radionuclide adsorbed onto a bed or
column of material such as alumina for which the daughter
has relatively little affinity. The daughter
radionuclide, which forms from decay of the parent, is
then periodically eluted from the column, for example,
using physiological saline.Many Tc-99m generators currently in use utilize
Mo-99 produced by the fission of highly enriched U-235
targets. Fission Mo-99 has extremely high specific
activity, i.e., >10,000 Ci/gram. Multicurie amounts of
Mo-99 can thus be adsorbed on very small alumina columns
(i.e., 1-1.5 grams of alumina) which can be efficiently
eluted to obtain high concentrations (i.e., >1 Ci Tc-99m)
in low volumes (i.e., less than 2-5 mL) of eluate.
However, fission of U-235 results in the production of
large quantities of gaseous and solid radioactive
materials of many elements - a burdensome and costly waste
management issue. Although it is possible to produce Mo-99 via
neutron bombardment of natural Mo-98 targets, this (η,γ)
reaction produces low specific activity (e.g.,
approximately 2.5 Ci/gram) Mo-99. Generators made with
such low specific activity Mo-99 require substantially
larger columns which, in turn, require increased volumes
of eluant. The resulting Tc-99m solution contains
undesirably low concentrations of Tc-99m in large volumes.In U.S. Patent No. 4,280,053, Evans et al.
describes a Tc-99m generator containing zirconium
molybdate (ZrOMoO4) gel prepared from (η,γ) Mo-99. The gel
is prepared by dissolving Mo-99 in a slight excess of
aqueous ammonia or sodium hydroxide solution. Acid is
added to adjust the pH to between 1.5 and 7 and the
resultant solution is added to a stirred aqueous solution
of zirconium. A molybdate precipitate is formed. The
precipitate is collected by filtration or evaporation of
the liquid, air-dried and then sized for use in a
ge
