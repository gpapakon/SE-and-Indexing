<ABSTRACT>
An adaptive maximum likelihood sequence estimator includes a 
channel estimator and a Viterbi algorithm processor for estimating the 

most likely transmitted symbol sequences. The algorithm 
processor includes a branch metric computer in which common 

components are found from regularity in computations of coded 
alphabets of the transmission symbols and are used for all branch metric 

computation to reduce the total amount of the operations. Such effective 
computations are implemented by either hardware or software in 

accordance with the constitution estimator.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to an adaptive maximum likelihood sequence 
estimator used as an equalizer for compensating distortions on a 
transmission channel and constituted of a channel estimator and a Viterbi 
algorithm processor. Digital mobile communications have been rapidly developed in 
these days. In a land mobile communication, distortions on transmission 
channels need to be compensated by an equalizer, because frequency 
selective fadings may occur due to many interference waves accompanied 
by delays and due to high speed movements of mobile terminals and may 
thereby grossly impair received signal wave forms. As a method applied 
to such an equalizer, a maximum likelihood sequence estimation method 
is known. The maximum likelihood sequence estimation method is one of 
the most effective equalizing methods for estimating the correct 
transmitting symbol sequence from the received signal wave forms which 
are distorted due to delay characteristics of the transmission channel, as 
of such frequency selective fadings. Referring to Figs. 1 to 3, an outline of digital mobile 
communications is described as follows. In a digital mobile  
 
communication system, the time division multiple access (TDMA) method 
is used to effectively utilize a limited frequency band and to readily 
connect to the ISDN (Integrated Service Digital Network) service 
implemented in fixed communication networks. Fig. 1 shows an example of a frame constitution for the TDMA 
method. In Fig. 1, one frame is composed of six time-slots Slot1 to 
Slot6. One or two time-slots are assigned to one user of the system. 
Each time-slot Slot1 to 6 is constituted of a 28-bit training sequence 
SYNC for training synchronizers and equalizers, a 12-bit information 
sequence for control SACCH, a 12-bit sequence CDVCC for identifying 
adjacent channels, a 260-bit data DATA, and a 12-bit reserved region 
RSVD. Fig. 2 shows a block diagram of a transmitting and receiving 
system of a digital mobile communication handling such a TDMA frame. 
In this transmitting and receiving system, a receiver 30 is connected to 
the output of a transmitter 10 through a transmission channel 20. The 
transmitter 10 includes an encoder 11, a transmission low pass filter 
(LPF) 12, a modulator 13 and the like. The receiver 30 includes a 
demodulator 31, a receiving low pass filter (LPF) 32, an equalizer 33, a 
decoder 34, and the like. In the transmitter 10, the encoder 11 converts input data bm (bit 
sequences in accordance with the TDMA frame constitution) into
