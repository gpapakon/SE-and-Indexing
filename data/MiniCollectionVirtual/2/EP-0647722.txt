<ABSTRACT>
This invention provides a gold alloy wire for bonding a semiconductor device to improve long term reliability 
of wire bonds to electrodes, reduce wire bending, increase the resistance against the flow of molding resin, and form 

a high wire loop. The gold alloy wire comprises 50 to 3,000 ppm by weight of Mn and the balance of gold and 
unavoidable impurities. Groups of elements to be added to the thin wire may be (1) 1 to 20 ppm by weight of at least 

one of Be and B, in total; (2) 1 to 30 ppm by weight of at least one of Ca, Sr and rare earth elements, in total; and (3) 
1 to 50 ppm by weight of at least one of In and Tl, in total; a preferable combination is (1), (2), (1)+(2), (2)+(3) or 

(1)+(2)+(3). The gold alloy wire according to the present invention provides wire bonds on a semiconductor device, 
which are reliable even under a high temperature condition and further the gold alloy wire can cope with high density 

packaging of semiconductors.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a thin gold-alloy wire
having high bonding reliability, which is used for
connecting an electrode on a semiconductor device to an
external lead.A thin gold-alloy wire has been mainly used as a
bonding wire for bonding electrodes on a semiconductor
device to external leads. An ultrasonic wave-thermal
pressing combination system has been employed generally
as bonding technology of the thin gold-alloy wire.
Namely, the distal end of the thin gold-alloy wire is
heated and molten by arc heat input to form a ball by a
surface tension. After this ball is press-bonded to an
electrode of a semiconductor device heated to a
temperature within the range of 150 to 300°C, it is
connected to an external lead by ultrasonic pressing.To use semiconductor devices such as transistors,
ICs, etc., as the product, a Si chip, bonding wires, and
the portions of a lead frame to which the Si chip is
fitted, are resin-molded for protection after bonding the
thin gold-alloy wire as described above.The characteristics which the thin gold-alloy wire
is required to possess have become diversified with the
higher integration density of semiconductor devices and
the reduction of their thickness. To cope with high
density wiring and narrow pitches, for example, the thin
gold-alloy wire must be thin or must be capable of high
looping, and in order to reduce the thickness of the
semiconductor device, the thin gold-alloy wire must be
capable of low looping. To satisfy elongation of the
wire, the reduction of the wire diameter and adjustment
of the loop height described above, thin gold-alloy wires
containing several kinds of elements as the additional 
elements have been developed, as described, for example,
in Japanese Unexamined Patent Publication (Kokai)
Nos. 61-296731 and 61-172343.Recently, the environmental condition for the use of
semiconductor devices has become more severe. For
example, semiconductor devices used inside the engine
compartment of an automobile are exposed to high
temperatures, e.g., a temperature range of 150 to 200°C,
or high humidity. The heat generated at the time of use
of semiconductor devices due to their high density
packaging cannot be neglected. When a thin gold-alloy
wire is used, the drop of long term reliability of the
bond with an aluminum electrode has become a problem.In semiconductor devices used under an environmental
condition where heat-resistance is a requisite, a thin
aluminum-alloy wire has been used in the past as a
bonding wire, and a ceramic package semiconductor
