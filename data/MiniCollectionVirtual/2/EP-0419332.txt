A screening assembly for a terminal block connected 
to a piece of electrical equipment placed inside a frame, 

this terminal block comprising an elongated insulating body 
(23A, 23B) having a coupling face (29) intended to receive 

several complementary screened connectors (18), this insulating 
body being provided with contact elements of a first 

type (28) which, when connected to the circuits of said 
piece of electrical equipment (10), are established in such 

a way as to be capable of connection to contact elements of 
a second type (36) of each of said complementary connectors, 

this screening assembly being characterised in that, 
said insulating body being positioned inside said frame 

such that its contact elements (28) pass through an aperture 
(33) made in a metal enclosure plate (12) of this 

frame, it comprises: 

on the one hand, two metal walls (41, 42) each 
covering respectively each of the two faces (34, 35) with 

the largest dimensions which, on this insulating body, are 
adjacent to said coupling face (29), these two walls extending, 

from the inside towards the outside of said frame, 
such that their external edges (47, 49) which are parallel 

to said enclosure plate (12) project past the extremities 
(37) of the contact elements of said insulating body, 
on the other hand, a plurality of metal partitions 
(43) arranged between these two walls (41, 42), perpendicular 

to the latter and to said coupling face (29), 
these partitions each extending from this face as far as 

said external edges (47, 49) of said walls, so as to constitute, 
together with these walls, a plurality of reception 

cavities (50) for complementary screened connectors, 
each cavity having dimensions such that the walls and 

partitions which delimit it come into contact with the 
screening of the complementary connector which is inserted 

in this cavity, this screening assembly being electrically  
 

connected to said enclosure plate (12) through the intermediary 
of a conductor element (55) which does not pass 

inside this frame. 
A screening assembly according to Claim 1, characterised 
in that, this screening element having dimensions 

so as to pass freely into the aperture (33) of the 
enclosure plate (12), the conductor element consists of a 

metal casing (55), shaped so as to fit with very little 
play over the walls (41, 42) of this screening assembly, 

this casing being provided with a window (56) for the 
passage of the reception cavities (50) and having dimensions 

so as to be applied to the enclosure plate (12) and 
thus to establish the electrical connection between this 

plate and this screening element. 
A screening assembly according to any one of Claims 
1 and 2, characterised in that, each screened connector 

(18) having a coupling face (31) of rectangular form, the 
two walls (41, 42) of this screening assembly have dimensions 

such that the plane (P) passing through the external 
edges (47, 49) of these walls is separated from the extr
emities 
(37) of the contact elements (28) of the insulating 

body (23A, 23B) by a distance, the value (f) of which is at 
least equal to a third of the length (b) of the coupling 

face (31) of each screened connector. 
A screening assembly according to any one of Claims 
1 to 3, characterised in that the contact elements (28) of 

the insulating body (23A, 23B) are arranged, inside each 
reception cavity (50), in m columns each extending in a 

direction parallel to the partitions (43), these columns 
being spaced from one another by a distance p, the contact 

elements (28) located in each reception cavity being separated 
from those located in the adjacent cavity by a distance 

equal to kp, k being a whole number.  
 
A screening assembly according to Claim 4, characterised 
in that the values of m and k are taken to be 

equal, respectively, to 2 and 3. 
A screening assembly according to any one of Claims 
4 and 5, characterised in that, each screened connector 

having a coupling face (31) rectangular in form with, in a 
direction perpendicular to the partitions (43), a dimension 

(d) satisfying the double inequality: 

(m + k - 2) p 
<
 d 
<
 (m + k - 1) p 
 
   these partitions (43) each have a thickness, the 

value e of which is given by the relationship: 

e = (m + k - 1) p - d - j 
 
   j representing the value of the play necessary for 

a screened connector to slide inside a reception cavity. 
A screening assembly according to Claim 6, characterised 
in that each of the partitions (43) has a thickness 

equal to 1 mm. 
A screening assembly according to any one of Claims 
1 to 7, characterised in that each of the partitions (43) 

consists of a part, the cross section of which is substantially 
U-shaped, the portions (51) of this part which 

correspond to the branches of the U having a length (t) 
less than the distance that separates two consecutive 

partitions, these portions thus constituting polarisation 
means for the screened connectors which are inserted into 

the reception cavities (50). 
A screening assembly according to any one of Claims 
1 to 8, characterised in that the walls (41, 42) and the 

partitions (43) are made of stainless steel. 
A support frame for electrical equipment, characterised 
in that it is provided, on at least one of its enclosure  

 
plates, with at least one screening assembly according 

to any one of Claims 1 to 9.
