<ABSTRACT>
An inertial measurement unit is provided which includes a core inertial measurement unit 
(13) having accelerometers (19, 21, 23) and gyroscopes (25, 27, 29) aligned along x, y and z axes 

to provide signals to an onboard computer (39) to determine position of the vehicle upon which 
they are mounted while in movement. A fourth accelerometer (35) is pivoted perpendicular to the 

direction of the gravitational field for measuring the gravitational field about the axis upon which it 
is mounted to provide a reference set of data to an onboard computer prior to movement of the 

vehicle upon which the system is mounted.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates generally to a inertial measurement apparatus and to a
method of improving the measurement accuracy of such an apparatus according to the preamble of
the independent claims.In present-day missile applications it is important to provide data indicative of rotational
motion of a missile as well as position and velocity data to a computer on board the missile for the
purpose of calculating adjustments in trajectory to arrive at a desired endpoint. Typically, such
systems rely upon multiple gyroscopes, one each for providing a indication of rotational motion
along the x (roll), y (pitch), and z (yaw) axes of such missiles to the onboard computer. In addition,
accelerometers are provided along the same axes as the gyroscopes for purposes of measuring
translational motion along the respective axes with the data from both the gyroscopes and the
accelerometers being provided to an onboard computer to adjust the trajectory of the missile, in a
conventional manner, based on the data received as compared to a calculated endpoint or set of data
to arrive at an endpoint. The real-time inflight data is compared to preset data to adjust the
trajectory in flight to arrive at the predetermined target destination. An example of the typical
systems to which the invention is directed is disclosed in U.S. 5,067,084.In the past, such a combination of units, i.e., accelerometers and gyroscopes, were known
as a core inertial measurement unit. Typically, in order to provide a reference prior to launch for
calculations being conducted in flight for measurements during the flight, a referenced set of values
is provided along each axis relative to rotational position as well as relative to a base gravitational
pull, i.e., gravity at sea level, at the launch site. Such base measurements have in the past been
provided by gimbaling the inertial measurement unit about at least two axes. Such an arrangement
has required a complicated and expensive gimbaling unit, which is essential to ensure missile
targeting accuracy. The systems with complicated gimbaled inertial measurement units have been in use in both
intercontinental ballistic missile application as well as in interceptor missile applications, the latter
requiring only a lower level of accuracy over short distances. In the case of applications of the prior
art inertial measurement unit on intercontinental ballistic missile systems (ICBMs), accuracy was
often enhanced by the use of a conventional star sensor which referenced a predetermined
