<ABSTRACT>
An integrated circuit comprises at least one input terminal 
and at least one output terminal, respectively intended for 

receiving and transmitting digital and/or analog signals, 
being associated with discrete circuit portions of the 

integrated circuit which implement different logic 
functions. Advantageously, such terminals are coincident 

with a single pin (2), and a circuit means (10) is arranged 
within the integrated circuit (1) to detect the logic state 

of the pin (2).

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a semiconductor integrated 
circuit incorporating a two-way pin. More specifically, the invention relates to an integrated 
circuit of the type which comprises at least one input 
terminal and at least one output terminal, respectively 
intended for receiving and transmitting digital and/or 
analog signals, said terminals being associated with 
discrete circuit portions of the integrated circuit 
implementing different logic functions, said terminals 
being coincident with a single pin, and with circuit means 
being arranged within the integrated circuit to detect the 
logic state of said pin. As is well known, external connection pins provide the 
terminations for a package containing an electronic 
semiconductor integrated circuit. They enable such a 
package to be mounted in a quick-connect fashion on a 
carrier board at the same time as its electric connections 
are made. A demand in this specific field of application is that the 
number of the external pins be minimized, to both bring 
down the package manufacturing costs and enhance the 
efficiency and reliability of the electronic device 
incorporated thereto. However, this demand clashes with the integrated circuit 
designer own requirements, who is called upon to 
consolidate and implement a number of logic functions in 
the circuit, but would then have a limited number of pins 
available for communicating the circuit to the outside. 
Another problem with which the integrated circuit designer 
is confronted is that the circuit is also to meet the  
 
requirements of the packaging line of its manufacturer. It 
can be appreciated, therefore, that the current trend 
toward a decreased number of external pins adds to the 
designer's work. For these reasons, the designer is seldom afforded a 
sufficient number of external pins to provide for all the 
functions he may seek, and is often to accept limitations 
on the circuit performance and/or potential for interfacing 
with external circuits connected to it. Understandably, it would be desirable if a single pin could 
be made to serve multiple functions, but this has not been 
feasible heretofore lest disturbance or interaction might 
occur between functions. As an example, consider Figure 1 herein, which shows an 
integrated circuit having a first digital output pin A 
whereon a voltage value may be present which corresponds to 
either a logic low (0-2.5 volts) or a logic high (3.5-5 
volts). A second pin B is intended, on the other hand, to act as a 
digital or control
