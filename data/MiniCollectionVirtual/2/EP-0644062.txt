<ABSTRACT>
A thermal transfer printing medium is provided 
which includes a foundation, and a transfer layer provided 

on one side of the foundation and comprising a heat-meltable 
color ink layer, a heat-meltable transparent ink 

layer, a metal deposition layer and an adhesive layer 
which are stacked in that order from the foundation side. 

The thermal transfer printing medium is capable of forming 
print images in a color inherent to the color ink layer, 

free from the influences of the color of the image-receiving 
medium and the metal deposition layer serving as 

a hiding layer.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to thermal 
transfer printing media and, more particularly, to a 
thermal transfer printing medium useful in printing images 
onto a colored image-receiving medium. Conventionally, the thermal transfer technology 
has been utilized for forming print images solely on white 
paper sheets. Recently, however, the thermal transfer 
technology has found increasing applications such as in 
forming heading labels, name labels and backbone labels. In these applications, printed images are 
frequently formed on colored image-receiving media; for 
instance, white characters are formed on a black image-receiving 
medium. A conventional thermal transfer printing medium 
having a white heat-meltable ink layer, however, has been 
able to provide only grayish print images when used in 
printing onto a black image-receiving medium. Such conventional white heat-meltable ink layer 
typically employs titanium oxide as a white pigment. 
Although titanium oxide per se has a great hiding power, 
limitations are imposed on the content of titanium oxide 
in the heat-meltable ink layer and the thickness of the 
ink layer for ensuring a satisfactory transferability of 
the ink layer and, hence, the hiding power of the whole 
ink layer cannot be enhanced. On the other hand, there has been proposed a 
prior art of enhancing a print density by providing a 
metal deposition layer on a color ink layer of a thermal 
transfer printing medium to cut off reflected light from a 
recording paper sheet (refer to Japanese Unexamined Patent 
Publication No. 92492/1988). Print images provided by this thermal transfer 
printing medium are surely not affected by the color of an 
image-receiving medium but influenced by the metal 
deposition layer serving as a hiding layer. For this  
 
reason, such a thermal transfer printing medium still 
involves a problem of impossibility of providing print 
images in a color inherent to the color ink layer. 
Specifically, where the metal deposition layer is an 
aluminum deposition layer and the color ink layer is, for 
example, a white ink layer, resulting print images are in 
a grayish color with their whiteness degraded. In view of the foregoing, it is an object of the 
present invention to provide a thermal transfer printing 
medium capable of forming print images which are affected 
by neither the color of an image-receiving medium nor a 
metal deposition layer serving as a hiding layer and which 
are in a color inherent to a color ink layer. This and other objects of the
