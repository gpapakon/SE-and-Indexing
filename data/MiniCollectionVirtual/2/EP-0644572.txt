<ABSTRACT>
This 
invention discloses 

an X-ray image 
intensifier including 

a vacuum container 
having a metallic 

X-ray input window 
(11a), and an input 

plane formed on the 
inner surface of the 

X-ray input window. 
In the container, 

convergence electrodes, 
an anode and 

an output plane are 
sequentially disposed 

along the path of 
electrons emitted from 

the input plane. The 
X-ray input window 

has a hardened 
undulating layer 

(11d) on the surface 
thereof on the input 

side and the input 
plane has a phosphor 

layer (12b) formed 
on the hardened 

undulating layer, 
and a photoelectric 

surface (12d) formed 
on the phosphor layer.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an X-ray image
intensifier.Recently, an X-ray image intensifier has been
widely applied to medical diagnosis, non-destructive
examinations and the like, in which an X-ray image
obtained by a low-energy X-ray having an X-ray tube
voltage of 30 kV (a tube current of 1 mA) or less, or
by a high-energy X-ray having an X-ray tube voltage of
30 kV (a tube current of 1 mA) or more is converted to
a visible light image.As shown in FIGS. 1 and 2, a convention (cf eg DE-A-21 37 392) X-ray
image intensifier is basically constituted of an input
screen 12, a focusing electrode 13, an anode 14, and an
output screen 15, all arranged in a vacuum envelope 11
(hereinafter referred to as an "envelope") in the order
mentioned from an X-ray source A. The envelope 11 has
an input window 11a made of metal, on which an X-ray is
incident, a body 11b made of glass for supporting the
focusing electrode, and an output portion 11c made of
optical glass serving as the output screen 15 or as a
support for the output screen 15.The input screen 12 provided at a predetermined 
distance from the input window 11a, functions as an
cathode. The input screen 12 is consisted of a curved
substrate 12a, for example, an aluminum metal substrate,
which is convex formed so as to project toward the
X-ray source A; a phosphor layer 12b for converting an
X-ray to a visible light, formed on the concave of the
metal substrate 12a; a transparent conductive film 12c
formed on the phosphor layer 12b; and a photocathode 12d
for converting the visible light from the phosphor layer
12b to electrons, formed on the transparent conductive
film 12c. The transparent conductive film 12c is
generally made of indium oxide, ITO (a compound made of
indium oxide and titanium oxide) or the like. The
transparent conductive film 12c is used for preventing
the reaction between an alkali halide such as sodium
iodide activated cesium iodide constituting the phosphor
layer 12 and a material constituting the photocathode
12d and for providing continuous conductivity on the
surface of the phosphor layer.On the other hand, an anode 14 is disposed in the
opposed side to the input screen 12, namely, in the side
in which the output screen 15 disposed (the outer face
herein is constituted by a structure such that the optical
glass substrate supporting output phosphors serves
as part of the envelope). The anode 14 is supported by
the side in which an envelope output portion 11c is
formed. Between the anode 14 and the input screen 12
used as the
