<ABSTRACT>
[Object]
 

   In a batteryless vehicle for driving loads such 
as electrical components by power obtainable from a 

generator driven based on a rotational output of an 
engine and activating an igniter based on the same 

rotational output, the generated power is supplied to 
the igniter in preference to others upon starting the 

engine so as to smoothly start the engine. 
[Constitution]
 

   A switching means 7 is provided between the 
output of a generator 3 and other load 6 other than an 

igniter 4 and a load supply-power controlling means 5. 
When an engine speed detected by a pickup coil 15 

reaches an engine speed corresponding to a threshold 
used for a load connection, a load connection deciding 

means 30 provided within the load supply-power 
controlling means 5 generates a detected output 30a to 

thereby activate a switch driving means 40 to bring the 
switching means 7 into a closed state so as to supply 

power to the other load 6. The load connection deciding 
means 30 has a hysteresis characteristic. Wh
en the  
 

engine speed reaches an engine speed substantially lower 
than that at the time of the load connection, the supply 

of the power to the other load 6 is stopped by the load 
connection deciding means 30.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to 
an apparatus 
for reducing and 
controlling electrical loads such as electrical components upon 
starting an engine of a batteryless vehicle. When an engine is started up, the number of 
revolutions of an input shaft of a generator is low and 
an output voltage generated from the generator is low. 
Thus, there is a situation in which power cannot be 
sufficiently supplied to an igniter. Therefore, a 
starting apparatus suitable for use in a batteryless 
vehicle, of a type wherein when the engine is started by 
either a kick starter or a recoil starter, loads such as 
a lamp, etc. are electrically disconnected, and the 
loads such as the lamp, etc. are then connected when an 
output voltage generated from a generator has risen, 
thereby making it possible to supply sufficient power to 
an igniter and smoothly start the engine, has been  
 
disclosed in Japanese Utility Model Application Laid-Open 
No. 4-137264. However, the conventional starting apparatus for 
the batteryless vehicle has a problem in that when the 
output voltage generated from the generator in a state 
in which the loads such as the lamp, etc. are being 
disconnected, has reached a predetermined threshold 
voltage, the load connection is made to thereby increase 
the electrical load on the generator upon the load 
connection, with the result that the output voltage is 
often reduced. Since the weight or quantity (power to be used 
up by the connected load) of the connected load varies 
depending on the states of setting of various switches 
or the like, the degree of reduction in the output 
voltage generated upon connecting the load also varies. Since the generated output is insufficient 
during an engine start-up period from the ignition to 
the complete explosion, there is a possibility that when 
other load is connected during this period, an engine 
speed is reduced and the power cannot be sufficiently 
supplied to the igniter.  
 Further, if consideration is taken in such a 
manner that power can be supplied to all the loads at 
idle, it is then necessary to set a threshold voltage 
for the load connection to a voltage lower than the 
generated output voltage at full load under the idle 
state. FIG. 6 is a graph for describing rise 
characteristics of voltages output from the generator 
upon starting up the engine. A characteristic A indicated by an imaginary 
line in FIG. 6 shows a characteristic of an output 
voltage generated at non-load. This characteristic is 
obtained by measuring the output
