<ABSTRACT>
A filter for filtrating molten resin of the invention 
includes: a cylindrical filtering member formed with a large 

number of projections and recesses; and radially arranged 
rods in a supporter for supporting the cylindrical filtering 

member at arc-shaped projected portions, and is constructed 
such that molten resin material is allowed to pass through 

the filtering member at arc-shaped recessed portions. In 
this arrangement, it is possible to enhance the resistance 

of thermoplastic molten resin filter against filtering 
pressure as well as to ensure a large filtering area. 

Further, the filter may be constructed such that the cross-section 
of the aforementioned cylindrical member is made 

greater from the upstream side toward the downstream side. 
By this configuration, the flow rate of molten resin passing 

through the unit area of the filtering member is made uniform 

and consequently the collecting capacity of foreign 
substances is increased.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a filter for filtering 
molten resin for use in a manufacturing process of films 
or fabric made of polypropylene, polyester and the like. It is extremely critical in quality control to remove 
foreign substances or impurities from molten resin in preparing 
a film or fabric from the molten resin. Therefore, 
various kinds of filters have been developed up to now. 
Figs.15 through 21 show examples of cylindrical filters used 
conventionally. The cylindrical filter shown in Figs.15 to 17 is made 
up of a cylindrical filtering member 1a and a porous plate 
14 and the cylindrical filtering member la takes a form of 
an annular or pleat-like cross-section. A large number of 
such cylindrical filters constitute a filtering device. The molten resin enters the inside of the cylinder by 
way of filtering member 1a and porous plate 14 and is extracted 
from an opening 3a. During the filtering process, 
filtering member 1a is supported from the inside thereof by  
 
porous plate 14 since the filtering member 1a itself is not 
enough rigid to stand the filtering pressure. Figs.18 and 19 show a filter including a filtering 
member 16 in which projected portions 5b and recessed portions 
6b are provided alternately by press-forming a flat-plate 
screen 1b as disclosed in Japanese Patent Application 
Provisional Publication (Kokai) No.2-253812. The molten 
resin flows into a filtering member 16 from an entrance 15 
and passes through filtering member 16, and flows out from 
an exit 17 of filtering member 16. Figs.20 and 21 shows a filter disclosed in Japanese 
Utility Model Publication (Kokoku) No.62-24502 in which a 
filtering surface 18 is arranged so as to be perpendicular 
to the flow direction of molten resin while the filter 
surface 18 has short and long projections 19 and 20 extending 
in the flow direction of molten resin, and a filter is 
arranged alternately mesh-wise forming an uneven filtering 
surface by the difference of projecting lengths. A molten 
resin flows from the filter surface 18 having alternate 
projections and is filtered. The present invention further relates to a filtering 
device for filtering molten resins which is employed in a 
multi-layer resin-forming extruder for forming films by 
laminating resins such as polypropylene, polyester, etc., in 
accordance with required film properties or characteristics.  
 
The molten resin filter of this invention can be used 
in this device. It is impossible in general to completely avoid contamination 
of foreign
