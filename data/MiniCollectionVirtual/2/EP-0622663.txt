<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a grip for use with a
camera as defined in the precharacterizing portion of claim 1.In general, a camera-integral-VTR (Video Tape Recorder) is designed compact
and, therefore, the camera-integral-VTR does not include
therein a separate carrying handle which is exclusively
used to carry the camera-integral-VTR. Also, although it
is possible to mount an under grip to the camera-integral-VTR
by use of a tripod screw in the bottom portion of the
camera, the thus mounted under grip is projected out from
the main body of the camera, which is inconvenient for
carrying and also gives rise to a problem in storing the
same into a camera case. In view of this, it is desirable
that an under grip to be applied to the camera-integral-VTR
can be stored compactly and has a function to serve as a
carrying handle as well.Also, it is desirable that the under grip, while 
being mounted to the camera-integral-VTR, can stand stably
by itself and can also be used as a simple tripod.Now, in Fig. 8, there is shown a video camera which
includes therein a camera grip according to the prior art,
and in Figs. 9 to 11, there is shown the above camera grip.As shown in Fig. 8, a video camera 101 includes a
lens 102 in the front portion thereof, a view finder 103
and a battery pack 104 in the rear portion thereof, and an
insertion portion 105 for insertion of a video tape in the
central portion thereof. And, in the lower surface of the
video camera 101, there are formed a positioning hole and a
screw hole (neither of the them are shown) which are used
to fix a grip 111 to be described later.As shown in Figs. 9 to 11, the grip 111 comprises a
base part 112 to be fixed to the video camera 101 and a
grip main body 113 to be mounted to the base part 112, and
the grip 111 further stores therein a leg portion 114 which
is used as a tripod.The grip base part 112 is formed in a box shape having
an opening in the top portion thereof. To the top opening
of the grip base part 112 is fixed a base plate 115 by a
plurality of fixing screws 116. A sheet 117 formed of
vinyl chloride is fixedly secured to the top surface of the
base plate 115 by means of a both-side tape. A mount screw
118 is supported rotatably in the top portion of the grip
base part 112. The top end of the mount screw 118 is 
projected out upwardly, while a disc-like operation knob
119 is formed integrally with the bottom portion of the
mount screw 118. Also, a positioning projection 120 is
formed integrally with the top surface of the base plate

<CLAIMS>
A camera grip which is removably attachable to a bottom
portion of a camera, comprising a mount screw (136, 145,

157) projecting out upwardly and threadedly engageable
with said camera bottom portion, and an operation knob

(133, 141, 153) for rotating said mount screw (136, 145,
157), 
characterised in that
 said mount screw (136, 145,
157) and said operation knob (133, 141, 153) being

connected with each other by means of a gear mechanism
(134, 135, 142, 144, 154, 155, 156).
A camera grip as set forth in claim 1, wherein said gear
mechanism (134, 135, 142, 144, 154, 155, 156) comprises a

first gear (135, 144) fixed coaxially with the shaft of
rotation of said mount screw (136, 145) and a second gear

(134, 142) fixed coaxially with the shaft of rotation of
said operation knob (133, 141) and meshable with said

first gear (135, 144).
A camera grip as set forth in claim 1 or 2, whrein said
first gear (135, 144) is an external gear (135) and said

second gear (134, 142) is an internal gear (142).
A camera grip as set forth in at least one of claims 1
to 3, wherein said first gear (135, 144) is an internal

gear (144) and said second gear (134, 142) is an external
gear (142). 
A camera grip as set forth in at least one of claims 1 to
4, wherein said gear mechanism (134, 135, 142, 144, 154,

155, 156) comprises a first external gear (156) fixed
coaxially with the shaft of rotation of said mount screw

(157), a second external gear (154) fixed coaxially with
the shaft of rotation of said operation knob (153), and

an idle gear (155) meshable with said first and second
external gears (156, 154) respectively.
