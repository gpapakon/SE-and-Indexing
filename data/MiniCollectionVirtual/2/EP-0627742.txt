<ABSTRACT>
In a semiconductor memory apparatus having a cell 
array structure wherein occurrence of leak current is 

reduced and a margin at the time of sensing is 
increased, a plurality of memory transistors (7) 

arranged in a matrix and having any one of four thresholds 
constitute banks in a column direction. The banks 

constitute memory cell arrays. A main bit line (1) of 
Al is connected to three sub-bit lines via first selection 

transistors (81). A main ground line (2) of Al is 
connected to two sub-ground lines via second selection 

transistors (84). Bank selection lines (SL) and word 
lines (WL) are formed to cross the main bit line and 

main ground line. Gates of the selection transistors 
are connected to the selection lines, and one selection 

line is connected to one selection transistor. Each of 
the sub-bit lines and sub-ground lines has a column of 

memory transistors which constitute a bank. A separation 

region (not shown) of a silicon oxide film, etc. is 
formed between the memory cell arrays to prevent leak 

current. Thereby, an information amount per one element 
can be made equal to a plural-bit information amount, 

and the bit data capacity can be increased.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a semiconductor
memory apparatus,
and more particularly to a memory cell array structure
of ROMs (Read Only Memory) for storing multi-value level
data.In a conventional ROM memory cell array which is a
general read-only semiconductor memory apparatus, memory
cells comprising MOS FETs are arranged in a matrix. The
gates of the memory cells are connected to a plurality
of word lines extending in the row direction, and the
sources and drains are connected to a plurality of bit
lines extending in the column direction. In this
structure, the capacity of the array is increased and
the number of memory cells connected to the bit lines
increases. Accordingly, a parasitic capacitance of the
bit lines increases and read-out speed decreases. There
has been proposed a bank-type ROM in which the parasitic
capacity of the bit lines is decreased and the read-out
speed is improved. In this ROM, the bit lines comprise
main bit lines with a longer wiring length and sub-bit
lines with a less wiring length. The memory cells are
stored in a plurality of banks, and the sub-bit lines
are connected to memory cells of the banks. The main
bit lines are connected to sub-bit lines via selection
transistors. In this ROM memory array having this
structure, a predetermined memory cell is read out in 
the following manner. The selection transistor is
operated on the basis of a bank selection signal representing
the bank to be selected, to which the
predetermined memory cell belongs. Thereby, the sub-bit
line is electrically connected to the main bit
line.The word line connected to the gate of the predetermined
memory cell is set at high level and the data
in the predetermined memory cell is read out. Since the
operation is effected in the state in which the sub-bit
line of the bank is electrically connected to the main
bit line and the junction capacitance of the memory
cells of each column is divided, an operation delay can
be prevented effectively. In a ROM, a one-bit memory is
normally composed of one transistor. In order to set
data in each memory cell, a threshold voltage of the
memory cell set in two levels, a high level and a low
level. Even if the data is set in this manner, only
one-bit data can be stored in one memory cell. Thus, in
order to fabricate a large-capacity memory, the chip
size increases disadvantageously.In order to solve this problem, a method has been
proposed wherein two-bit data is stored in one memory
cell and thereby the chip size is reduced. A ROM
employing this method is
