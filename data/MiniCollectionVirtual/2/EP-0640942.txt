<ABSTRACT>
The graphics applications of a 2-D graphics computer system 
provide each object to be rendered on a 2-D raster display with a pair of 

rendering reference coordinates (x and y), and a relative depth value (z). 
Additionally, the computer system is provided with a library of predetermined 2-D 

images and sounds, and a number of graphics toolkit routines. As the user 
"moves", the graphics toolkit routines render selected ones of the 

predetermined images based on x/z and y/z values of recomputed x and y 
rendering coordinates and the relative depth value z of the objects, and actuate 

the sounds if applicable based on their predetermined manners of rendering. 
As a result, the objects that are further away from the user will move slower than 

the objects that are closer to the user, thereby introducing the effect of parallax 
and added realism to the 2-D graphics computer system at a substantially lower 

cost.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to the field of computer graphics,
including graphical user interfaces. More specifically, the present invention
relates to a method and apparatus for rendering objects in a computer display
with added realism.In a 3-D graphics computer system having a 2-D raster display,
realistic 3-D effects are typically achieved by rendering objects on the 2-D raster
display using perspective algorithms. A perspective algorithm well known in the
art is the "z-divide" algorithm. Under this approach, every point of every object to
be rendered has a triplet of coordinates (x, y, z) associated with it. Before the
objects are rendered, the x and y coordinates of all points of all objects, are
divided by their corresponding z values. The objects are then rendered by
rendering all points in accordance with the computed x/z and y/z values. An
example of such 3-D graphics computer systems is the Sparcstation®,
manufactured by Sun Microsystems Inc., of Mountain View, California, embodied
with the Programmer's Hierarchical Interactive Graphics System (PHIGS)
(Sparcstation is a registered trademark of Sun Microsystems). The 3-D effects
are realistically achieved, because the z-divides are performed for all points of all
objects to be rendered, and the amount of computations, and therefore the
resources in terms of CPU time and storage required, are substantial. As a result, 
3-D graphics computer systems tend to be more costly than other non-three
dimensional display systems.In 2-D graphics computer systems, objects are rendered on the 2-D
raster display through parallel projections. The user's eye is set at infinity. Using
this approach, every object to be rendered has a pair of coordinates (x, y)
associated with it. Beyond the x and y coordinates, only a "depth" order is
provided for determining which object gets displayed when two objects overlap.
Particular examples of such 2-D graphics computer systems include the
Macintosh® computer systems, manufactured by Apple Computer, Inc. of
Cupertino, California, and various personal computers based on the X'86
microprocessor of Intel, Inc., of Santa Clara, California, manufactured by IBM of
Armonk, New York, and other vendors, embodied with the Window™ system of
Microsoft, Inc. of Redmond, Washington (Macintosh is a registered trademark of
Apple Computer and Window is a trademark of Microsoft). Since there are no z-divides
to be performed for every point of every object to be rendered, the amount
of computations, and therefore the resources required,
