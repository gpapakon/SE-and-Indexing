<ABSTRACT>
A frequency synthesizer, which realizes speed-up of channel 
switching between channels having separated frequencies, has an 

EEPROM (10) which stores the phase difference between a first 
frequency divider (2) and a second frequency divider (4) producing 

outputs corresponding to the frequencies of the channels to be 
switched. A delay circuit (7) delays the output of the second 

frequency phase divider by an amount corresponding to an amount 
of the phase difference stored in the EEPROM. A controller (9) 

supplies the outputs of the second frequency divider and the 
delay circuit to a phase detector (5). Further, the controller stops 

a PLL operation and restarts it in synchronism with a leading 
edge of, preferably, a second period of the output signal of the 

reference oscillator to which the preset phase difference is 
given.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a frequency synthesizer
and, more particularly, to a high speed switching technique for
switching transmitting/receiving channels in a mobile radio
communication system.It has been anticipated that current analog mobile telephone
systems will reach capacity in the near future because the
recent, substantial increase in the number of mobile telephone
subscribers. Therefore, digital mobile telephone systems are
being introduced. Such digital systems require terminals capable
of switching channels at high speed.US-A-4 442 412 discloses a phase locked-loop generator compensating
a non-linear characteristic of a VCO and having a memory for
storing compensating data for variations depending on the temperature.To realize high speed switching, a phase locked loop (PLL)
frequency synthesizer controlling one or both of input
frequencies to a phase detector may be used. Such a PLL
frequency synthesizer is described, for example, in
JP-A-01-151824 or
JP-A-03-54917
. In such PLL frequency synthesizers, the switching time
from one channel to a channel adjacent thereto requires a time
period of as short as 100Âµs. However, when it is necessary to
switch from a channel of one extreme frequency of a band to a
channel of the other extreme frequency, it takes a time which is 
10 to 20 times greater. This is caused by "take-in time", which
is indispensable for PLL operation.It is therefore an object of the present invention to
provide a frequency synthesizer capable of switching the
frequency of a channel to that of another channel remote
therefrom at the high speed realized in channel switching between
adjacent channels. This object is solved with the features of the claims.A frequency
synthesizer as described includes a voltage-controlled oscillator, a first
frequency divider for dividing the frequency of an output of the
voltage-controlled oscillator, a reference oscillator, a second
frequency divider for dividing the frequency of an output of the
reference oscillator, a phase detector for outputting a voltage
corresponding to a phase difference between the outputs of the
first frequency divider and the second frequency divider, a loop
filter constituting a control loop for providing an input of the
voltage controlled oscillator by removing a high frequency
component of the output of the phase comparator, memory for
preliminarily storing the phase difference between the output
frequencies of the first frequency divider and the second
frequency divider, which frequency correspond to that
