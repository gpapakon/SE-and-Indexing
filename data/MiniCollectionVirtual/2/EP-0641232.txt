<ABSTRACT>
A method and apparatus is provided for electrically simulating magnetotherapy to a living body. The apparatus comprises a permanent magnet (17) and a coil (23) surrounding the permanent magnet (17). A voltage is applied across the coil (23) in a direction to enhance the magnetic flux in the permanent magnet (17). The coil is made of a D-block transition metal such as copper which has free electrons. The negative charge of these free electrons is thought to attract the positive electromagnetic charge of the enhanced magnetic flux so a magnetic flux can be electromagnetically transferred with the electron flow through the permanent magnet (17) and conductors (21') through terminals (3) and (5) to enable the magnetic flux to pass to and through the living body. The conductors (21') and any further conductors connected to the terminals (3) and (5) and used to make physical contact with the living body should also be of a D-block transition metal. The circuit has an output circuit (21) which will assist the flow of the magnetic flux through the living body. The output circuit has two coils (25, 27) which boost the magnetic flux to thereby assist the flow of the magnetic flux.

<DESCRIPTION>
 TREATMENT OF LIVING BODIES Field of the InventionThis invention relates to treatment of living bodies and relates particularly, but not exclusively, to treatment of the human body.Description of Prior Art It has been well known and well documented that magÏ€etotherapy can improve certain conditions in human bodies. This therapy is thousands of years old but recent work by Dr. Jean-Bernard Baron of National Scientific Research Centre in Paris, France has documented that considerable improvement can be achieved in connection with a wide range of disorders including convergence of the eye, scoliosis, hemiphlegia, 

facial paralysis, muscle contractures, arthritis, tendonitis, synovitis, tension headache, post-operative and other pain, and sports injuries.As a result of the research by Dr. J-B. Baron, other doctors in different medical research institutions have followed him in studying the healing effects provided by magnetotherapy. Similar works have been undertaken in Japan but no scientific materials have been published.The practice of magnetotherapy involves applying small permanent magnets across the affected areas so that a flux will flow into the human body. Many devices have been created for applying the flux of the permanent magnets to the body. One recent innovation involves the use of permanent magnets embedded within a blanket upon which a patient lies or which is placed over the patient. Contact is made with the affected area so that flux can flow into the body. Object and Statement of the Invention The application of permanent magnets directly to the skin of the human body across the affected area is considered to be generally unpleasant and partly troublesome to implement. In the case of the magnetic blankets, good magnetic contact with the surface of the skin across the affected area is not always possible. Accordingly, enhanced treatment could be provided if the magnetic flux could be applied electrically to the human body across the affected area. Accordingly it is an object of the present invention to provide a method and apparatus for electrically simulating the treatment which can be produced by magnetotherapy.We have ascertained that a magnetic flux can be carried in a conductor by the electrons in the conductor provided the conductor itself is of a type which has free electrons.Accordingly, with the above in mind, a first broad aspect of the present invention may reside in a method of treating a living body for the purpose of simulating the treatment which can be produced by
