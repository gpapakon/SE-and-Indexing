<ABSTRACT>
An electrostatic type detector 10 as a short cycle 
unevenness sensor is arranged upstream from a set of back 

rollers, while a long cycle unevenness sensor is arranged 
downstream from a set of front rollers. The detector 10 

is arranged in a high frequency bridge circuit 25, which 
issues a signal indicating the short cycle unevenness of 

a sliver. A correction feedback circuit 28 is provided 
for directing the output signal to a variable 

capacitor 23 in the bridge circuit 25. An integrator 30 
is provided in the correction feedback circuit 28 to 

obtain an average signal from the sliver unevenness 
detected by the detector 10, which average signal is used 

for varying the capacitance value of the variable 
capacitor 23. Such a correction feedback circuit allows 

the center of the operating range of the bridge circuit 
to be centered on the linear portion of the output 

characteristic of the bridge circuit. Furthermore, the 
value of the time constant of the integrator 30, in 

relation to the short cycle unevenness, is set to 
eliminate a low frequency components caused by long cycle 

unevenness as well as by temperature drift. As a result, 
only a component originating from the short cycle 

unevenness sensor is combined with a long cycle 
unevenness signal from the long cycle unevenness sensor 

to provide a signal for controlling the drafting ratio of 
the back and front rollers, whereby an unevenness of the 

sliver can be effectively reduced.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a device for 
controlling an unevenness of a sliver in a drafting 
apparatus for a spinning machine, such as a drawing frame 
or a carding machine. Known in the prior art is a device for controlling 
the unevenness of a sliver, in a drafting apparatus in a 
spinning machine, comprising a sensor for short-cycle 
unevenness arranged upstream from a set of back rollers, 
a sensor for long cycle unevenness arranged downstream 
from a set of front rollers, a servo unit for controlling 
the ratio of the rotational speeds of the back and front 
rollers to obtain a desired drafting ratio, a feed 
forward section connected to the short cycle unevenness 
sensor for generating a feed forward signal, a feed back 
section connected to the long cycle unevenness section 
for generating a feed back signal, and a section for 
combining the feed forward and feed back signals for 
generating an output signal directed to a servo unit. 
See Japanese Examined Patent Publication No. 44-23148. The apparatus in the prior art is defective in that 
a drift easily occurs in the unevenness signal from a 
short cycle unevenness sensor constructed as an 
electrostatic sensor, thereby reducing the precision of 
the control of the unevenness of the sliver. An object of the present invention is to provide a 
drafting device, for a spinning machine, capable of 
overcoming the drawbacks in the prior art. According to the present invention, in order to 
attain this object, a device is provided for controlling 
an unevenness of a sliver in a drafting apparatus for a 
spinning machine, wherein a first sensor for detecting a 
short cycle unevenness of the sliver constructed as an 
electrostatic type detector is arranged upstream from a  
 
pair of back rollers of the drafting apparatus, while a 
second sensor for detecting a long cycle unevenness of 
the sliver is arranged downstream of a pair of front 
rollers, means are provided for combining signals from a 
feed forward channel from the first sensor as well as a 
feed back channel from the second sensor, to a signal for 
varying a relationship of rotational speeds of one of the 
pairs of the back and front rollers with respect to the 
other pair, thereby executing a feed forward control for 
a short cycle unevenness, on one hand, and a feed back 
control for a long cycle unevenness, on the other hand, 
in order to obtain a desired draft ratio, characterized
