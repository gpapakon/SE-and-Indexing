<ABSTRACT>
Polymer polyols which have (1) exceptional dispersion stability, especially at high styrene 
contents, and (2) substantially smaller particle sizes than polymer polyols having 

equivalent viscosity are obtained by forming a first reaction product by feeding the 
following materials to a first continuous reactor in the presence of a free radical initiator 

or catalyst: (a) less than about 50 wt% of a total monomer proportion or monomer 
mixture, preferably comprising styrene/acrylonitrile at a ratio preferably greater than about 

50/50 wt%; (b) at least about 50 wt% of a total base polyol proportion; and, optionally but 
preferably, (c) a majority of a precursor stabilizer and (d) a polymer control agent (PCA). 

The product from this first reaction then is again fed through a continuous reactor, which 
may be the same as the first reactor, along with additional initiator, at least about 50% of 

the total monomer proportion, any balance of the total base polyol proportion and any 
balance of the optional precursor stabilizer and PCA.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to methods
of making polymer polyols, and to methods of forming polyurethanes made from such
polymer polyols.Polymer polyols commonly are used to produce polyurethane
foams. Basically, polymer polyols are produced by polymerizing one
or more ethylenically unsaturated monomers dissolved or dispersed
in a polyol in the presence of a free radical catalyst to form a
stable dispersion of polymer particles in the polyol. Polymer
polyols are valuable because they can produce polyurethane foam
which has high load-bearing properties.The first commercially accepted polymer polyols primarily were
produced using acrylonitrile monomer, and had a somewhat higher
viscosity than desired for some applications. More recently,
polymer polyols of lower viscosity have been produced using
acrylonitrile-styrene monomer mixtures.Polyurethane foams made from polymer polyols have a wide
variety of uses. The two major types of polyurethane foam
generally are slabstock and molded foam. Slabstock foam made using
polymer polyols typically is used in the carpet, furniture, and
bedding industries. The primary type of molded foam, generally
termed high resiliency (HR) molded foam, is used widely in the 
automotive industry for applications ranging from molded seats to
energy-absorbing padding and the like.The wide demand for polyurethane foams has spawned a need for
polymer polyols that can produce foams having a wide variety of
characteristics. For example, a demand exists for slabstock foam
that is virtually scorch-free. It also is desirable for these
scorch-free foams to have low density (viz. -- 24 kg/m3 (1.5 pounds per cubic
foot) or less) while maintaining satisfactory load-bearing and other
foam properties. One way to produce such a foam is to use a
monomer mixture having a high styrene content (e.g., about 65 to 70
percent styrene).The preparation of polymer polyols using a monomer mixture
with a high styrene content creates difficulties. For example, the
commercial processability of a particular polymer polyol depends
upon its stability against phase separation, or its stability
against the polymer particles settling out of the polyol medium.
Many applications require rigorous stability, which becomes more
difficult to achieve when high styrene content monomer mixtures are
employed. It has been found that a higher stability polymer polyol
may be obtained if the components used to make the polymer polyol
are not fed to the reactor all at once. For example, U. S. Patent
