<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to pyrazole
derivatives. More specifically, it relates to novel
pyrazole derivatives, a process for the production thereof,
herbicides containing them as active ingredients, and novel
intermediate compounds suitable for the production thereof.During a growing period of corn, etc., a
triazine-based herbicide such as atrazine and acid
anilide-based herbicides such as alachlor and metolachlor
have been conventionally used, while atrazine shows
low efficacy to gramineous weeds, and arachlor and
metolachlor show low efficacy to broad-leaved weeds. It is
therefore difficult at present to control gramineous weeds
and broad-leaved weeds at the same time with a single
herbicide. Further, the above herbicides are undesirable in
view of an environmental problem due to their high dosage
requirement.On the other hand, it is known that specific 4-benzoyl-pyrazole
derivatives have herbicidal activity (see
JP-A-63-122672, JP-A-63-122673, JP-A-63-170365, JP-A-1-52759,
JP-A-2-173 and JP-A-2-288866). Further, for example,
pyrazolate of the following formula is known as a commercial
herbicide.
However, pyrazole derivatives having a thiochroman
ring such as compounds of the present invention have not yet
been known so far.Further, the commercially available herbicide,
pyrazolate, is for use in a paddy field, and it hardly has
herbicidal activity when used in a plowed field. Further,
4-benzoyl-pyrazole derivatives that have been already
disclosed are insufficient in practical use although they
have herbicidal activity in a plowed field. For example,
the 4-benzoyl-pyrazole derivatives disclosed in JP-A-63-122672
have activity to broad-leaved weeds such as
cocklebur, velvetleaf, slender amaranth, etc., when used for
foliar treatment, while the activity thereof is practically
insufficient. Further, they show very poor activity to
gramineous weeds such as green foxtail, large crabgrass,
barnyardgrass, etc. In soil treatment, the above
derivatives show activity to gramineous weeds such as green
foxtail, large crabgrass, barnyardgrass, etc., while they
show very poor activity to broad-leaved weeds such as
cocklebur, velvetleaf, slender amaranth, etc.It is an object of the present invention, in a
broad sense, to provide a novel pyrazole derivative which
shows high selectivity to corn, wheat and barley and which
can control gramineous weeds and broad-leaved weeds at low
dosage by any one of foliar treatment and soil treatment.
More specifically, it is an object of the present invention
to provide the
