<ABSTRACT>
This invention relates to a festoon lamp holder, and to a lighting system 
incorporating such a lamp holder. The lamp holder (1) comprises a moulded base 

(2) and cap (3), and forms a pressure-tight seal with the supply cable (8), and a 
water-tight seal with a removably attached globe (17). Between the cap and base, 

lugs (9) with detents (10) engage within a groove (11), and through a camming 
action on a tapered section (15) of a post (13), engage permanently with a retaining 

means (16), thereby locking the detents within the groove. Probes (4) between the 
cap and base pierce the cable, which may be used to support the lamp holder in a 

festoon lighting system. The lamp (6) may be a low voltage halogen lamp and may 
also be formed as a festoon bulb (23) held perpendicular to the lamp holder by 

hooked wires (27,28).

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a combination of a lamp and a lamp holder therefor.Certain types of long-life low voltage lamps are presented as a festoon lamp
having a generally cylindrical envelope with an electrical connection at each end.
The electrical connection consists, in one form of lamp, in a wire loop extending
from each end of the quartz or glass envelope. Such lamps are intended to fit into
low profile reflector holders having a sprung connector at one or both ends which
bears against the wire loop to make the electrical contact, the lamp being held
lengthways in line with the base. It is desirable to be able to use such lamps in low
voltage lighting systems in accordance with the invention, since they would reduce
still further the maintenance required. However, it is necessary for the light to be
emitted in all directions, rather than simply through substantially 2π radians as
occurs in a flat reflector light with which such lamps are normally associated.The invention provides a lamp holder which permits such lamps to be
held perpendicular to the base. allowing light to be radiated through substantially
4π radians.Our European Patent EP-B-0 422 117 discloses a lamp holder which is
arranged to be secured to a cable in such a manner as to be a permanent fitting and
to give a pressure-tight seal to the cap enclosing the connection to the cable. The
lamp holder is thus resistant to tampering and vandalism, and has a very long
service life, because the problems arising from corrosion due to moisture ingress do
not arise. The lamp holder comprises a base and a cap. the base having a pair of part-circular
lugs upstanding therefrom with outwardly facing detents which engage
with a continuous groove around the inner surface of the cap. The locking or
retaining surfaces of the groove and the detent extend in a plane normal to the axis
of symmetry of the cap, so that there is no tendency for the surfaces to cam apart if
an attempt is made to prise the cap from the base. This ensures permanency in the
fitting of the cap to the base, but it makes the manufacture of the caps difficult,
because conventional plastics moulding techniques do not readily permit the
formation in such a confined space of the retaining surface which is normal to the
direction of withdrawal of an internal moulding tool. Thus, it has been necessary to
machine the recess into the inner surface of the cap after moulding, and this adds
significantly to the cost of manufacture.To permit the groove to be formed during moulding of the cap.

<CLAIMS>
In combination, a lamp and a lamp holder therefor, the lamp holder
(1) comprising a base (2) and two electrical contacts (5a, 5b) for forming a

connection with the lamp, and the lamp (23) comprising an envelope (24) around
an electrical filament (26) with two wire connectors (25) therefrom each passing

through the envelope to form a connection with the contacts (5a, 5b), characterised
in that each wire connector forms a loop (25) protruding through the envelope at

opposite ends thereof, and each electrical contact (5a, 5b) comprises a wire with a
hook (27, 28) at its free end formed to engage one of the two loops, a shorter one of

the wires (27) engaging the nearer end of the lamp, and a longer spring wire (28)
engaging the far end of the lamp in a manner that induces a spring tension in the

spring wire, so retaining each hook within its respective loop.
A combination according to Claim 1, wherein the spring wire (28) is
formed from stainless steel, phosphor-bronze, titanium, or an alloy of titanium.
A combination according to Claim 1 or 2, characterised in that the
base comprises a base portion (2) and a cap portion (3), a first of the portions

having a plurality of lugs (9) upstanding therefrom with detents (10) engageable in
an internal groove (11) in a substantially non-deformable second portion, and the

base has a lamp socket (21) electrically connected to upstanding electrical probes
(4) in use contained within a channel (31) between the two engaged portions and

extending thereacross to receive therethrough an insulated electrical supply cable
(8), whereby as the second portion is engaged with the first portion, the cap is

arranged to press down on the cable to force the probes through the cable insulation
to make contact with the cable conductors, and camming means (15) in the second

portion is arranged to apply a camming action to the lugs and engage the lugs with 
retaining means (16), thereby preventing inward deflection of the lugs and ensuring

that the two portions are permanently secured to each other.
A combination according to Claim 3, wherein the camming means
is angled at about 45° to the axis of the lug to which it applies the camming action.
A combination according to Claim 3 or 4, wherein the retaining
means is arranged just to engage the lugs when the base and cap are engaged.
A combination according to any of Claims 3 to 5, wherein the first
portion is the base, and the second portion is the cap.
A combination according to any of Claims 3 to 6, wherein the
channel is substantially in the base portion.
A combination according to any of Claims 3 to 7, wherein the cap
and base are substantially circular in plan.
A combination according to any of Claims 3 to 8, wherein a
pressure-tight seal is formed between the base, cap and electrical cable.
A combination according to any of Claims 3 to 9, wherein the base is
shaped to receive a lamp globe (17) with one or more seals (20) to form a watertight

seal between the globe and the base.
A combination according to Claim 10, wherein the base comprises a
socket (21) with a tapered skirt (22) to retain the globe within the socket, and the

skirt has at least one retaining screw (30) to lock the globe to the base.
A festoon lighting system having a plurality of the lamp holders (1)
and associated lamps (2) as defined in any of the preceding claims, attached to and

separated along an insulated electrical power supply cable (8).
