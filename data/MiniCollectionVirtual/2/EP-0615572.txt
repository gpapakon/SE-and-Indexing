<DESCRIPTION>
 DOWNHOLE ADJUSTABLE STABILIZER AND METHODField of the Invention The present invention relates to a variable diameter stabilizer suitable for use within a drill string of a hydrocarbon recovery operation. More particularly, this invention relates to a drill string stabilizer wherein the stabilizer blade diameter may be reliably adjusted by operator surface sequencing techniques while the stabilizer remains downhole, and without requiring surface-to-stabilizer wireline operations. The adjustable stabilizer and technique of the present invention are applicable to varying well conditions to enhance stabilizer flexibility, and comparatively high radial forces may be applied to the stabilizer blades without complex mechanical force- multiplying devices. Background of the InventionThose skilled in the art of drilling hydrocarbon recovery wells have long recognized the benefits of downhole stabilizers placed at strategic locations within the drill string. Numerous advances have been made to the design, material construction, and operation of stabilizers which have enhanced drilling operations, and thereby lowered hydrocarbon recovery costs. While drill string stabilizers have utility in borehole operations which are not related to hydrocarbon recovery, their primary purpose relates to use in hydrocarbon recovery wells, and accordingly that use is described herein.One significant technological feature of downhole stabilizer relates to its ability to adjust the stabilizer diameter while the stabilizer is downhole by radially moving the stabilizer blades with respect to a fixed diameter stabilizer body. While blades in a stabilizer system have historically been "changed out" at the surface to increase or decrease the stabilizer diameter, this operation is time-consuming and thus expensive. The desirable downhole adjustment feature of a stabilizer has significant benefits with respect to selectively altering the drilling trajectory, particularly for stabilizers positioned close to the drill bit. By selectively increasing or decreasing the stabilizer diameter while downhole, drilling operators are better able to accommodate oversized holes or holes very close to gage. The drill string may be more easily tripped in and tripped out of a well bore by reducing the stabilizer diameter during this phase compared to the stabilizer's maximum diameter used in drilling operations, thereby saving substantial time and drilling costs. While wireline retrievable tools may be used for adjusting the stabilizer diameter while the
