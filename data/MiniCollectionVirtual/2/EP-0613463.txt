<DESCRIPTION>
 DERIVATIVES OF CYCLIC PHENOLIC THIOETHERS AS INHIBITORS OR STIMULATORS OF SUPEROXIDE GENERATIONBackground of the Invention1. Field of the Invention 10 The present invention relates to cyclic phenolic fc thioethers and more particularly relates to the novel compounds of Formula I which are inhibitors or stimulators of superoxide generation and may also inhibit cyclooxygenase and/or 5-lipoxygenase. The15 compounds of the present invention which stimulate superoxide generation may be useful as adjunctive therapeutic agents in the treatment of infections. Other compounds of the present invention which inhibit superoxide generation may be useful in the therapeutic20 or prophylactic treatment of disease conditions which are mediated wholly or partly by superoxide generation such as adult respiratory distress syndrome, superoxide mediated inflammatory or allergic conditions, and other medical conditions which are caused by or aggravated by25 superoxide.The compounds of Formula I which inhibit cyclooxygenase or 5-lipoxygenase are useful, for example, as anti-inflammatory and/or anti-allergy agents and in the treatment of hypersensitivity30 reactions, psoriasis, asthma, and related disorders and conditions in which physiologically active agents formed in the arachidonic acid metabolic pathway are involved. Compounds of the present invention may be useful in treating inflammatory and allergic conditions35 such as arthritis, asthma, and psoriasis.\ 2. Background Information'* Recently, oxygen radicals have been implicated in the pathogenesis of many diseases. This implication is 40 reflected by the many conferences devoted to this topic, books on the subject of free radicals and disease, and the appearance of two new specialized 

 journals: Free Radical Research Communications, and Free Radical Biology and Medicine.Much is known about the physicochemical properties of the various oxygen radicals, but knowledge of their overall importance in the initiation and amplification of human disease is limited. Some clinical conditions in which oxygen radicals are thought to be involved are discussed in Cross, C. E. , et al. , "Oxygen Radicals and Human Disease," ANN. INT. MED., 107:526-545 (1987) (see Table l, p. 527) and Ward, P. A., et al., "Oxygen Radicals, Inflammation, and Tissue Injury," FREE RADICAL BIOLOGY & MEDICINE, 5:403-408 (1988). Among the clinical conditions in which oxygen radicals are thought to be involved are, for example, inflammatory- immune injury, autoimmune diseases, ischemia-reflow states, aging
