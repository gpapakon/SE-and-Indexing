<ABSTRACT>
In a manual chain block a no-load side chain guide 
(44) of the load chain guides (43, 44) is provided with an 

anchoring portion (45) for anchoring a no-load end portion 
of a load chain (4). The anchoring portion (45) is 

provided with a load receiving portion (46) for receiving 
a load acting on the no-load side end portion.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a manual chain block,
and more specifically to a manual chain block having a load
sheave supported rotatably between a pair of side plates so
as to be driven interlockingly by a manual actuating device
such as a hand wheel and the like.Conventionally, for example as disclosed in the
Japanese Utility Model Publication No. Sho. 2 (1974)-42601,
a manual chain block has a load sheave supported rotatably
between a pair of side frames so as to be driven
interlockingly by a manual actuating device comprising a
hand wheel and a hand chain and a load chain which is
looped around the load sheave and has a hook on its load
side with its no-load side anchored to an anchoring pin 102
disposed between the side frames 101 as shown in Fig. 9.
Further, between the side frames 101 there is provided a
load chain guide 105 for making the load chain 104 mesh
smoothly with the load sheave 103. When the load sheave
103 is driven to rotate by an operation of the hand chain
of the manual actuating device, the load side portion 104a
of the load chain 104 is raised or lowered so as to lift or
lower a cargo by the hook of its load side end portion.When lowering the cargo by unwinding the load side
portion 104a of the load chain 104, since an end of the no-load
side portion 104b is anchored to the anchoring pin
102, the no-load side portion 104b anchored to the
anchoring in 102 takes merely a tensioned state so as to be
prevented from further unwinding even though the load side
portion 104a of the load chain 104 has been unwound for
lowering to the utmost limit. As mentioned above, the further unwinding of the load
chain 104 is prevented during lowering of the cargo by
anchoring the no-load side end of the chain 104 to the
anchoring pin 102. But, since the unwinding of the load
chain 104 is carried out by rotating the load sheave 103
through the operation of the hand chain, when an operator
continues to operate the hand chain without noticing the
unwinding limit, there appears a problem that a bending
moment acts concentrically on the anchoring pin 102 to
deform the pin 102. Further, since the anchoring pin 102 is
disposed separately aside from the load chain guide 105 with
being secured between the side frames 101, not only the
number of the component parts increases but also it becomes
necessary to carry out such a working as to assemble it to
the side frames 101 individually, so that there appears a
deficiency also in the assembling workability.Further, in the conventional embodiment described

<CLAIMS>
A manual chain block having a load sheave (3) supported
rotatably between a pair of side plates (1,2) so as to be driven

interlockingly by a manual actuating device (20) wherein between
said side plates (1,2) there are provided a pair of load chain

guides (43,44) adapted to guide a load chain coming up to said
load sheave (3), 
characterised in that
 the load chain is guided
so as to force the chain toward said load sheave (3) and that the

no-load side chain guide (44), serving to guide the no-load side
portion of the load chain, has an anchoring portion (45) adapted

to anchor the no-load side end portion of said load chain and a
load receiving portion (46) adapted to receive a load acting on

the no-load side end portion of said load chain and prevent
thereby a deformation of the anchoring portion.
A manual chain block as set forth in claim 1 wherein said
no-loaded side chain guide (44) is provided with a vertical link

receiving portion (57) adapted to receive a vertical link (4b)
connecting to the no-load side end portion anchored to the

anchoring portion (45), and transferring to the load sheave (3)
and a horizontal link receiving portion (58) adapted to receive

a horizontal link (4c).
A manual chain block as set forth in claim 1, wherein said
each chain guide (43, 44) has a chain deviation restraining

portion (55) disposed in such a portion thereof as to face the
load sheave (3) on the rear side in the approaching direction of

the load chain relative to the load sheave (3) so as to serve to
restrain a radially outward deviation of the chain relative to

the load sheave (3) on that rear side.
A manual chain block as set forth in any one of claims 1
through 3, wherein said each chain guide (43, 44) has a guide

portion (56) disposed in such a portion thereof as to 
face the load sheave (3) on the fore side in the

approaching direction of the load chain relative to the
load sheave (3) so as to correct a twist of the load chain

coming up to the load sheave.
