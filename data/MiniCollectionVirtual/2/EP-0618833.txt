<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to liquid filtration 
devices which use the differential pressure 
between atmospheric pressure and a vacuum as a 
driving force to perform the filtration. More 
particularly, this invention relates to a vacuum 
driven liquid filtration system that is 
disposable. At the present time, there are many 
disposable liquid filtration systems available 
that use vacuum as a driving force. However, all 
of these devices require the vacuum hose be 
directly connected to the disposable device. 
Consequently, the vacuum hose must be repeatedly 
connected and disconnected from the system as 
successive filtrations are performed. These 
devices are inherently unstable when a vacuum 
hose is attached to them because the devices are 
lightweight and in many instances the hose 
connection to the filtrate receptacle is at an 
elevated level. The instability of these devices 
is aggravated when the vacuum hose is twisted. 
Frequently, to avoid tipping during filtration a 
user will place a weight on top of the device or  
 
simply stabilize the system by hand. US-A-3478889 and DE-C-403858 both disclose vacuum 
filtration devices in which the filtration receptacle is 
located within a vacuum chamber which is connected to an 
outside vacuum source. Neither document discloses a 
filtration receptacle mounted on a base which is 
connected to an outside vacuum source. GB-A-2250927 discloses a vacuum filtration device which 
has a vacuum base below the filtration receptacle. 
However, it is not connected to an outside vacuum source 
as it has its own vacuum creation device located within 
the base. The principle object of the present invention is to 
overcome the shortcomings of the prior art. To 
accomplish this and other objects, the liquid filtration 
system of the present invention includes disposable 
funnel and filtrate receptacles and a reusable base. The 
base is connected to a vacuum source, and the vacuum 
source is automatically connected to the filtrate 
receptacle when the receptacle is mounted on the base. 
The base may be weighted and in addition may include a 
suction chamber that securely anchors the base to a 
supporting surface when the vacuum system is activated. The invention overcomes the problems of the prior art by  
 
providing a reusable base having a vacuum chamber 
therein, the base having an opening through which a 
vacuum may be applied to the vacuum chamber, the base 
being constructed to releasably support a filtration 
receptacle when mounted on top of the base and to 
op
