<ABSTRACT>
A mail insertion machine (10) having an elongated insert track (12) with one or more insert dispensing devices (16) with rotary insert feeding mechanisms (22) for depositing inserts at longitudinally-spaced movable driving members (14) on the insert track includes a power train interconnected between the driving members and each insert dispensing device for driving them in a pre-determined phase relationship with a phase-adjustment mechanism for adjusting the phase relationship. The phase-adjustment mechanism includes first and second power transmitting elements (28, 30) which can be selectively engaged with and disengaged from one another by an engaging mechanism (38), an electronic sensing and indicating mechanism mounted on the first and second power transmitting elements for sensing their positions relative to one another and providing an electronic phase-indicating signal indicative thereof, and a phase-adjustment mechanism (54, 60, 64) coupled to the power train for acting on the power train when the first and second power transmitting elements are disengaged to achieve a desired phase-indication signal from the electronic sensing and indicating mechanism.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates generally to the art of mail
inserting machines, that is machines for preparing
groups of inserts to be inserted into envelopes or the
like.Envelope inserting machines often include insert
tracks along which pusher pins move to drive groups, or
piles, of inserts which are sequentially deposited
thereon by gripper jaws of insert rotors, or the like.
That is, there are often a plurality of insert
dispensing devices having rotors spaced along an insert
track, each depositing a different insert in front of
each pair of pusher pins, thereby creating a pile of
inserts in front of each pair of pusher pins which is
eventually inserted into an envelope. Because such mail
insertion machines are often used with different size
inserts, it is often necessary to change phase
relationships, or synchronization, between various ones
of the insert dispensing devices and the pairs of pusher
pins on the insert track. In this regard, spacings
between insert track pusher pin pairs are normally fixed
as is an angular distance between gripper jaws on insert
rotors of the insert dispensing devices. However, it is
normally desirable that each insert dispensing device
deposits its insert on the insert track immediately in
front of a pusher pin pair. If it deposits an insert
too far in front of a pusher pin pair, the insert will
not be on the insert pile of the pusher pin pair which
makes it difficult to insert the pile into an envelope.
Also, inserts which are too far in front of pusher pin
pairs, are not quickly brought into registration by
pusher pin pairs and can thereby improperly rotate and 
possibly jam the insert track. On the other hand, if an
insert dispensing device deposits an insert on top of a
pusher pin pair so that the pusher pin pair does not
contact edges of the insert to control it and bring it
into registration with other inserts of a pile, this
could also jam up the insert track and/or cause inserts
to get into incorrect piles.Normally, gripper jaws of insert rotors grip
leading edges of inserts for depositing them onto the
insert track. Thus, if an insert dispensing device is
depositing inserts 15.24 cm (six inches) wide onto the insert
track, it will be synchronized to release leading edges
of the inserts slightly more than 15.24 cm (six inches) from pusher
pin pairs on the insert track in order to deposit the
inserts immediately in front of the pusher pin pairs.
It will be appreciated that if an insert dispensing
device at an insert station, which has been depositing 15.24 cm
(six-inch
