<ABSTRACT>
An analogue electronic timepiece with lap function, which can display a lap 
time correctly with the hand moving naturally. The lap time is the time taken in one 

lap between two interrupt signals. 
The present invention includes a system control circuit for outputting a control 
signal B in response to a signal A from an outer input means 401 to a chronograph 

storing means 405 for storing the value of a chronograph measuring means 404. A lap 
time calculating means 406 to which measured data of the chronograph measuring 

means 404 and former measured data stored in the chronograph storing means 405 by a 
former lap control signal are inputted for calculating the time difference between the 

above two data and outputting a correcting drive signal F if the hand requires a 
correcting drive as a result of the above calculation. Drive judging means 408 to which 

a lap input signal G, an interruption signal F, and the correcting drive signal F are 
inputted for outputting data of the drive number if the hand requires driving.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an analogue electronic timepiece with 
chronographic function, and in particular relates to a constitution of a hand driving 
control circuit for measuring a lap time during chronographic measurement. In the past, some analogue multifunction electronic timepieces have displayed 
the elapsed time which is termed a split time hereinafter. However, none of them have 
displayed the time between two points of measurement which is termed a lap time 
hereinafter, while the time is being measured. EP-A-0 215 345 discloses a stop watch capable of indicating plurality of split 
times. In such a stop watch, when a switch is depressed, hands are operated to start 
timing. Every time a split time switch is depressed, the time intervals between time 
points at which the split time switch is depressed are sequentially stored in a memory. 
Thus, when the switch is re-depressed, the stop watch terminates its time measurement. 
A plurality of split times up to the end of the time measurement can be reproduced 
from the later split time to the earlier split time. In contrast, EP-A-0 506 120 discloses a stop watch which can inform a time 
difference between a measured time and a target time and a raised or lowered degree of 
the measured time to the target time without complicated calculation. Such a stop 
watch comprises time measuring means for starting to measure time on a basis of a start 
command, a lap switch to be operated during a time measurement by the time 
measuring means, lap time means for obtaining time information from the preceding 
operation of the lap switch when the lap switch is operated, and hand means rotatably 
driven to the position of 0 o'clock when the lap switch is operated and to a position of 
10 o'clock when the same time as the time information obtained by the lap time means 
is elapsed.  
 U.S. 4,738,268 discloses a relative time clock in which the relative time 
between two or more events is recorded independently of real time or wall clock time. 
The time clock counts in units until the clock reaches a predetermined maximum 
time at which point the continuous time clock will reset and repeat its previous count 
cycle. The time indicated on the continuous time clock is recorded and correlated to 
events such as the start and finish of data recording,. A final event, such as data 
transfer is also correlated to the time indicated on the continuous time clock. After this 
date is processed the relative time of any event can be determined with respect to any
