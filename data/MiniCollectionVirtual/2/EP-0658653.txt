Vibratory screed for a road finisher, with a vibratory
unit (4), which comprises a vibratory member (17) connected to

a vibratory drive (19) and comprising a sole plate (16) of large
surface, and with a guide plate (12) positioned obliquely with

respect to the sole plate (16), characterised in that located
between the guide plate (12) and the sole plate (16) of the

vibratory member (17) is a separate vibratory strip (24)
connected to the vibratory drive (19) of the vibratory member

(17) and provided with an inlet chamfer (26).
Vibratory screed according to Claim 1, characterised in
that the vibratory drive (19) is connected by way of support arms

(22) to the vibratory strip (24) and the vibratory member (17),
which are located at the ends of the support arms (22).
Vibratory screed according to Claim 2, characterised in
that the support arms (22) are mounted to rotate about bearings

(27) located in the placement direction in the rear region.
Vibratory screed according to Claim 3, characterised in
that the bearings (27) are formed from resilient cushioning

springs with a high spring rigidity both in the radial direction
as well as in the direction of rotation.
Vibratory screed according to one of Claims 1 to 4,
characterised in that the position of the vibratory strip (24)

is centered elastically.
Vibratory screed according to Claim 4 or 5, characterised
in that the centering force can be varied.
Vibratory screed according to Claim 5 or 6, characterised
in that the centering is a spring centering.
Vibratory screed according to Claim 5 or 6, characterised 
in that the centering is a rubber-oscillating member centering.
Vibratory screed according to one of Claims 1 to 8,
characterised in that the distribution of the forces supplied by

the vibratory drive (19) of the vibratory strip (24) and the
vibratory member (17) is adjustable.
Vibratory screed according to one of Claims 2 to 9,
characterised in that the support arms (22) are constructed in

the form of double levers.
Vibratory screed according to one of Claims 2 to 10,
characterised in that the support arms (22) each comprise a

projection (28), which are spring-centered and/or able to tilt
for the distribution of the forces supplied by the vibratory

drive (19) of the vibratory strip (24) and the vibratory member
(17).
Vibratory screed according to one of Claims 1 to 11,
characterised in that the inlet chamfer (26) of the vibratory

strip (24) is at substantially the same angle with respect to the
horizontal as the guide plate (12).
Vibratory screed according to Claim 12, characterised in
that the inlet chamfer (26) of the vibratory strip (24) is at an

angle of 30 to 70° with respect to the horizontal.
Vibratory screed according to one of Claims 1 to 13,
characterised in that the vibratory drive is infinitely

adjustable as regards frequency and amplitude.
Vibratory screed according to one of Claims 1 to 14,
characterised in that a tamping unit (3) is provided comprising

at least one tamping strip (7) located between the guide plate
(12) and the vibratory strip (24) as well as a tamper drive (5).
Vibratory screed according to Claim 15, characterised in 
that the tamping strip (7) and vibratory strip (24) are

vertically adjustable relative to each other.
Vibratory screed according to Claim 15 or 16,
characterised in that the inlet chamfer (26) of the vibratory

strip (24) is substantially flatter than an inlet chamfer (9)
located on the front edge of the tamping strip (7).
Vibratory screed according to Claim 16 or 17,
characterised in that the inlet chamfer (26) of the vibratory

strip (24) has an angle of 10 to 30° and that of the tamping
strip (7) an angle of 30 to 70°.
Vibratory screed according to one of Claims 2 to 18,
characterised in that the support arms (22) are restricted in

their uppermost position by resilient stops (42).
Vibratory screed according to Claim 19, characterised in
that the resilient stops (42) are adjustable.
