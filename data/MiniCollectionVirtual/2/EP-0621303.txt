<ABSTRACT>
Perfluorotripentylamine, perfluoropolyether or another such 
high-boiling liquid is added as a foaming agent to a thermoplastic 

fluororesin such as a tetrafluoroethylene-perfluoroalkyl vinyl 
ether copolymer resin or a tetrafluoroethylene-hexafluoropropylene 

copolymer resin. Because the vapor pressure of said foaming agent 
in the molten fluororesin is lower than that of Freon or another 

such low-boiling foaming agent, the cells in the foam can be made 
fine and uniform in diameter.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a foamed thermoplastic 
fluororesin insulating material. Compared with other macromoleclar materials, fluororesins have 
lower dielectric constants, small dielectric tangents, and other 
excellent electrical characteristics. For this reason, 
fluororesins have been used in the past as dielectric materials, 
and have recently been made into foams in order to improve the 
electrical characteristics. Of these fluororesin materials, foams 
with closed-cell pore structures have recently attracted particular 
attention because of the advantage that such cells are crushed less 
readily than open cells. In the past, fluororesin foams have been manufactured by 
methods in which a liquefied gas (e.g., hydrocarbon or 
fluorocarbon) is injected into a molten resin, and foaming is 
effected through the expansion of the gas contained in the resin as 
it emerges from the die. The reason that such methods have been 
adopted is that the molding temperature of a fluororesin is higher 
than that of an ordinary thermoplastic resin, so foaming cannot be 
accomplished using a thermally decomposable chemical foaming agent 
employed with such a thermoplastic resin. However, the viscoelasticity of molten thermoplastic 
fluororesins is low and when a thermoplastic fluoropolymer resin 
foam is manufactured by extrusion molding, the gas that is formed 
by the decomposition of the foaming agent in the molten fluororesin 
causes rapid expansion due to the pressure difference with the 
atmosphere as the resin is extruded from the die orifice and 
released from the pressure that exists inside the extruder. As a  
 
result, the cells inside the fluororesin foam thus obtained are 
generally large, with an average diameter of approximately 150 
micrometers or so, and the dispersion in the cell diameter is 
considerable. Thus, if such a fluororesin foam is used, for 
example, as an insulator for a thin insulated electrical wire, the 
cells will sometimes reach the outer surface of the insulator, 
making its surface rough or its outside diameter nonuniform, and 
causing the electrical characteristics to become nonuniform along 
the length of the electrical wire. It has now been discovered that a foam with small, uniform 
closed cells can be obtained using a thermoplastic fluororesin and 
a foaming agent for which the melting point of the former and the 
boiling point of the latter lie within a predetermined range. More specifically, the fluororesin foam of this invention is 
obtained by foaming a blend of a
