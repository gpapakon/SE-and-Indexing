<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a highly flexible item of 
sports footwear. As is known, footwear used for some specific skiing 
techniques, such as the so-called "telemark" and "cross-country" 
techniques, must have particular technical 
characteristics that ensure optimum longitudinal flexing of 
the item of footwear and excellent resistance to lateral 
torsion while allowing even prolonged use of the item of 
footwear on mixed terrain, uphill and downhill, and 
maintaining excellent comfort for the user's foot, and must 
ensure lateral support and precise transmission of 
movements to the ski. However, current items of footwear are not free of 
drawbacks. For example, compression often occurs on the metatarsal 
region during the flexing of a known shoe due to the 
corrugation of the upper of the item of footwear, 
consequently reducing the comfort of the item of footwear. Furthermore, in footwear of this type the flexibility and 
tilt of the item of footwear are almost exclusively 
entrusted to the elastic characteristics of the materials 
used to manufacture it, and particularly to the sole of the 
item, in order to ensure both precise ski control when 
turning and high resistance to lateral torsion and to  
 
flexibility in the metatarsal region. Obviously, since the materials employed must 
simultaneously have several different requirements to 
ensure good technical performance, the consequent result is 
always poor. The aim of the present invention is to eliminate the 
drawbacks described above by providing a highly flexible 
item of sports footwear that provides considerable comfort 
since compressions of the metatarsal region during its 
flexing are eliminated. Within the scope of this aim, an important object of the 
invention is to provide an item of sports footwear that 
allows to vary the value of its flexibility and tilt 
according to the user's requirements. Another object of the invention is to provide an item of 
sports footwear that has excellent rear support and 
enormously facilitates rolling of the foot while the user 
is walking. Another object of the invention is to provide an item of 
sports footwear that can be advantageously assembled with 
known processes involving gluing, direct injection or 
mechanical assembly, with a rigid or partially rigid shell 
or with a conventional leather upper, preserving the main 
characteristics of extremely high flexing and tilting.  
 Another object of the invention is to provide a highly 
flexible item of sports footwear having a high degree

<CLAIMS>
Highly flexible item of sports footwear comprising, in a 
front portion, at the axis of natural flexing of the foot, a 

first unidirectional articulation means (2) formed by a 
recess in the material in a downward region of the front 

portion of the upper (3), said recess being suitable to form 
a wedge-shaped space (5) between said front portion of said 

upper and the sole (4) for the gradual tilting of at least 
said upper (3) with respect to said sole thereof, a first 

flexible means (6) being furthermore provided between said 
upper and said sole, whereby the value of the flexing of said 

item of footwear may be varied. 
Item of footwear according to claim 1, characterized in 
that it comprises, on said sole, at said first articulation 

means (2), at least one second unidirectional articulation 
means (7, 8, 9, 10, 11) that cooperates with said first 

articulation means to vary said flexibility of said item of 
footwear. 
Item of footwear according to claim 1, characterized in 
that said first flexible means comprises a bellows-like 

part (6) which is connected to said front portion of said 
upper (3) and said sole (4) to sealingly close said wedge-shaped 

space (5).  
 
Item of footwear according to claim 2, characterized in 
that said second articulation means comprises an easy-flexing 

region (7) formed on said sole. 
Item of footwear according to claim 2, characterized in 
that said second articulation means comprises a tip (8) of 

said sole which is pivoted to the plantar arch (10) thereof 
by virtue of a pivot (11) that engages respective holes 

formed on two wings (12) of said tip and a central 
expansion (13) that lies between said wings and extends 

from said plantar arch. 
Item of footwear according to claim 6, characterized in 
that said wings (12) have a rear retention block (15) for 

the unidirectional rotation of said tip with respect to 
said plantar arch. 
Item of footwear according to claim 1, characterized in 
that it comprises a second flexible means (16, 17) which is 

accommodated in said space (5) and comprises at least one 
block (16) that engages a corresponding seat (17) formed on 

said sole. 
Item of footwear according to claim 8, characterized in 
that said block (16) comprises at least two regions (18, 

19) having different resistance to the compression force 
produced between said front portion of said upper and said 

sole during the flexing of said item of footwear. 
Item of footwear according to claim 1, characterized in  

 
that it comprises at least one part (20) for locking said 

front portion of said upper with respect to said sole in a 
position for the maximum opening of said wedge-shaped space. 
Item of footwear according to claim 1, characterized in 
that it comprises a part (21) for connecting said front 

portion of said upper to said sole in a position for 
completely closing said wedge-shaped space.
