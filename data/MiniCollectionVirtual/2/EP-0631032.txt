<ABSTRACT>
The present invention relates to a directable-shield tunnelling machine, for whole front face tunnelling. This tunnelling machine comprises a substantially cylindrical body (1), a peripheral cutting edge (110) inside which an extracting shield (130) is rotationally mounted, as well as a system (4) for removing debris via the rear end (12) of the body, is characterised in that the shield (130) comprises at least one opening (161-168) emerging in front of a work-face (F) of a gallery (G) to be tunnelled, and capable of being closed by at least one flap (141-148) capable of pivoting about a radial axis of the body (1) under the effect of one or more jacks (5) or the like, each flap being capable of being fitted with extraction tools (14) so that the area of the said opening (161-168) and/or the extraction angle of the tools (14) can be adjusted under the effect of pivoting of the flaps (141-148). The present invention applies to the production of tunnelling machines of various sizes and for various types of galleries or tunnels.

Tunnelling machine (T) for the driving of a gallery (G) in the ground (S)
and of the type comprising a substantially cylindrical body (1) of which

one so-called front end (11) defines opposite a working face (F) of the
gallery (G), a peripheral bit (110) inside of which is rotatably mounted a

stoping shield (130), this shield comprising, in its front face, at least two
flaps (141-148) mounted for pivoting about radial axes, between a

position parallel to this face and a position inclined with respect to the
latter, each flap being formed of at least one portion of a sector of a

circle and provided on its front edge with a plurality of tools (14, 134)
adapted to dig into the said face (F), characterized in that the pivot axes

of the flaps are lying in the said front face of the shield and each flap
(141-148) is pivotally mounted at the ends of its front edge onto the

central rotating drive shaft of the shield and a radially outer crown ring
of the shield, between a position of closure of this front face and an

inclined position of opening of the face and in that the pivot control
means of each flap are connected to the radially outer end of the rear

edge of the flap.
Tunnelling machine according to claim 1, characterized in that the
shield (130) comprises at least three flaps (141-148) made fast to for

rotation with a central shaft (18) of the body (1) and which may each
one pivot between an open state where substantially the edge only of

this flap is opposite the working face (F) and a closure state in which the
shield (130) preferably hermetically isolates the inside of the body (1)

from the working face (F), each flap exhibiting the shape of a sector of a
circle with an angular extension of 120Â°.
Tunnelling machine according to at least one of the foregoing claims,
characterized in that each flap (141-148) is mounted onto the body (1)

through the medium of three pivotal connections (54, 114, 154) of
which two (114, 154) which are aligned near the working face (F) 

constitute the aforesaid pivot axis whereas the third one (54) which has
the shape of a pivot sliding along one radius of the body (1), is made

fast to an element (52) slidable in the aforesaid longitudinal direction
(X-X') under the effects of jacks (5) or the like, between a position

corresponding to the open state and a position corresponding to the
closure state of the shield (130).
Tunnelling machine according to the foregoing claim, characterized in
that one (154) of the two aforesaid pivotal connections, which constitute

the pivot axis of each flap (141-148), is mounted onto the central shaft
(15) with respect to which is sliding the element (52) to which the third

pivotal connection (54) is made fast whereas the other one is made fast
to a disc (134) mounted for rotation in the peripheral edge (110).
Tunnelling machine according to one of the foregoing claims,
characterized in that the central shaft (15) comprises a central front

portion (18;18') with a tapered shape and provided with at least one tool
(184), this front portion, which is directed forward of the body (1)

projecting outwards of the peripheral edge (110).
Tunnelling machine according to the foregoing claim, characterized in
that the aforesaid central front portion (18') is slidably mounted and

displaceable with the assistance of a jack or the like along the
longitudinal axis (X-X') of the body (1).
Tunnelling machine according to at least one of the foregoing claims,
characterized in that the body (1) comprises an internal envelope (2) and

an external envelope (17) concentrically mounted and fitted with means
for relative positioning and immobilizing (217) the one within the other

one.
Tunnelling machine according to the foregoing claim, characterized in
that the internal envelope (2) of the body (1) comprises at least two

independently pressurizable zones connected by a lock. 
Tunnelling machine according to one of the foregoing claims,
characterized in that the aforesaid body (1) comprises at the level of its

rear end (12), means (127) for the relocalization of the tunnelling
machine (T) with respect to a predetermined path of travel provided for

the gallery (G).
Tunnelling machine according to one of the foregoing claims,
characterized in that one aforesaid flap (141-148) exhibits the shape of a

portion of a circle and in that the pivotal connection axis extends along
one radial edge of this flap between the central axis of the body (1) and

the periphery of the shield (130).
Tunnelling machine according to claim 10, characterized in that the
whole front face opposite a working face (F) of the gallery is formed of

flaps in the shape of a portion of an arc of a circle, so that the said front
face exhibits the shape of a screw of which the blades are formed of the

flaps.
Tunnelling machine according to one of claims 3 to 11, characterized in
that the element (52) carrying the third pivotal connections (54) of the

flaps is provided in the shape of a crown ring coaxially mounted and
axially slidable on the central shaft (15) of the body (1) of the tunnelling

machine.
