<ABSTRACT>
A dilating catheter for insertion into a body duct. The catheter includes an outer tubular member having a distal portion and a proximal portion, wherein the distal portion has a radially deformable portion having a balloon, and, on either side of said balloon, at least one opening communicating with said body duct and enabling the fluid in the duct to pass therethrough; an inner tubular member (1); and a microtube (7) having one end located inside the balloon while the other end is connected to a fluid supply for inflating and deflating said balloon. The balloon (2) includes an outer wall designed to contact the inner wall of the body duct in the operative position, and an inner wall sealably attached to said outer wall and capable of defining an inner annular cavity therewith in the operative position. Said catheter further includes a shaped supporting member for retaining said inner balloon wall in the operative position while enabling the circulation of body fluid in the space between said inner element and the inner wall (9) of the balloon. The catheter is particularly useful for treating disorders of the coronary arteries.

Dilating catheter, intended to be introduced 
in a bodily duct such as in particular a blood vessel, 

comprising: 

an outer tubular element comprising a distal part 
and a proximal part, presenting at the level of its 

distal part a radially deformable portion (6) comprising 
a balloon (2), and on either side of this balloon 

at least one orifice (3, 4) communicating with said 
bodily duct and allowing the passage of the fluid 

circulating in the bodily duct within said outer tubular 
element, 
an inner tubular element (1) disposed inside said 
outer tubular element and allowing the passage of 

a guide; 
a micro-tube (7), preferably disposed inside said 
outer tubular element, opening out at one end inside 

said balloon and connected at its other end to a source 
of fluid supply to allow inflation and deflation of 

said balloon; 
said balloon (2) comprising an outer wall (8) intended 
to come into contact with the inn
er wall of said 
bodily duct, in position of use, characterized in 

that: 
an inner wall (9) is hermetically fixed to 
said outer wall and is capable of defining therewith, 

in position of use, an annular inner cavity (10); 
and in that it further comprises a support 
element shaped in order to maintain said inner wall 

of the balloon in position of use, while allowing 
circulation of the bodily fluid (1) in the space included 

between said inner element and the inner wall 
(9) of the balloon. 
Dilating catheter according to Claim 1, characterized 
in that the outer tubular element comprises  

 
a flexible tube 5 on the front part of which is hermetically 

fixed a radially deformable sheath-forming 
part (6) forming part in the balloon (2). 
Dilating catheter according to Claim 1 or 2, 
characterized in that the said support element comprises 

a sleeve (11) of generally cylindrical form, displaceable 
longitudinally between a position of rest 

in which it lies upstream of the balloon (2) and a 
working position in which it supports and maintains 

the inner wall (9) of the balloon (2), spacing it 
apart from the tubular element (1) and thus creating 

a slot (13) for the passage of the bodily fluid inside 
the sleeve. 
Dilating catheter according to Claim 3, characterized 
in that the sleeve (11) is connected at its 

rear end, via a conical wall (14), to a sliding tube 
(15), of substantially circular transverse section, 

whose inner diameter is slightly greater than the 
outer diameter of the tubular element (1) and whose 

outer diameter is less than the inner diameter of 
said tube (5). 
Dilating catheter according to Claim 4, characterized 
in that said conical wall (14) comprises one 

or more orifices (16) allowing passage inside the 
sleeve (11) of said bodily fluid. 
Dilating catheter according to one of Claims 
3 to 5, characterized in that said sleeve (11) comprises 

at its front end a conical wall (17) comprising 
one or more orifices (18) ensuring passage of the 

bodily fluid inside the sleeve (11) towards that part 
of the bodily duct located downstream of the balloon 

(2). 
Dilating catheter according to Claim 1 or 2, 
characterized in that said support element comprises 

a helical spring (26) of which the front end (27)  
 

disposed downstream of the balloon (2) is fixed and 
of which the rear end (28) is mobile; said spring 

(28) being capable of occupying a position of elongation, 
obtained by traction of its rear end (28) and 

a position of rest in which its turns located at the 
level of the balloon (2) support and maintain the 

inner wall (9) of the balloon, spacing it apart from 
the tubular element (1) and thus creating a slot for 

the passage of the bodily fluid. 
Dilating catheter according to Claim 7, characterized 
in that the rear end (28) of said spring (26) 

is fixed in a housing provided in a sliding tube (29) 
whose inner diameter is slightly greater than the 

outer diameter of the tubular element (1) and whose 
outer diameter is less than the inner diameter of 

said tube (5).
