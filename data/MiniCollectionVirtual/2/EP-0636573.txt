<ABSTRACT>
A capping unit (1) wherein a number of capping 
heads (63), movable with a supporting carrousel conveyor 

(10) about a first axis (11), are each rotated about a 
respective second axis (47a) by a respective first shaft 

(61) movable axially on the carrousel conveyor (10), for 
moving the respective head (63) to and from a respective 

container (3) movable with the carrousel conveyor (10) 
and coaxial with the second axis (47a). Each head (63) 

provides for closing the respective container (3) with a 
cap (5) presenting an internally threaded ring nut (6) 

mounted for rotation on a pump-operated nozzle (9), and 
presents a first and second gripping device (83, 84) for 

respectively gripping the nozzle (9) and the ring nut 
(6) and controlled by a second shaft (64) movable 

axially in relation to the first shaft (61). The first 
gripping device (83) is angularly fixed in relation to 

the carrousel conveyor (10), whereas the second gripping 
device (84) rotates with the capping head (63) about the 

second axis (47a).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a capping unit 
for automatically assembling pump-operated spray cap 
bottles. Here and hereinafter, the term "pump-operated 
spray cap bottle" is intended to mean a bottle 
comprising a container with an externally threaded neck; 
and a pump-operated cap defined by an internally 
threaded cup-shaped ring nut connected releasably to the 
threaded neck of the container and in rotary and axially 
fixed manner to a pump body presenting, on one side, a 
suction tube extending inside the container, and, on the 
other, a nozzle projecting axially outwards of the ring 
nut and substantially consisting of a hand-operated 
piston with a lateral ejector. More particularly, the present invention relates 
to a capping unit according to the preamble of claim 1 for 
automatically assembling 
pump-operated spray cap bottles comprising a container 
with an externally threaded neck, and a pump-operated 
cap presenting a nozzle and an internally threaded ring  
 
nut fitted to the nozzle so as to rotate about a first 
axis; the unit being substantially of the type described 
in US-A-5 207 048 and comprising a capping head in turn 
comprising first and second engaging means movable to 
and from respective positions wherein they respectively 
engage said ring nut and the respective said nozzle, for 
rotating the ring nut about the first axis and in 
relation to the nozzle. One of the major drawbacks of the known units of 
the above type is that such units positively engage the 
ring nut, but not the nozzle, and are capable to operate 
correctly only when the nozzle is provided with a 
lateral spout. It is an object of the present invention to 
provide a relatively low-cost, reliable capping unit for 
automatically connecting the container and cap of 
pump-operated spray cap bottles. More specifically, it is an object of the present 
invention to provide a capping unit designed to 
positively engage both the nozzle and ring nut of the 
pump-operated cap of a pump-operated spray cap bottle, 
and which provides, in a straightforward, reliable 
manner, for rotating the ring nut in relation to the 
nozzle and so screwing the ring nut on to the threaded 
neck of the container. It is a further object of the present invention to 
provide a capping unit designed to rotate the ring nut 
without ruining it.  
 According to the present invention, there is 
provided a capping unit for automatically assembling 
pump-operated spray cap bottles comprising a container 
with an externally threaded neck, and
