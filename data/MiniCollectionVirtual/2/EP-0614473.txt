<DESCRIPTION>
The invention is directed to pressure-sensitive
adhesives that exhibit clean removability from various
substrates without sacrificing guillotinability.It is well known in the pressure-sensitive
adhesives industry that two approaches have been tried
to achieve a good removability, namely, controlled
coating processes and/or adhesive rheology.If the coat weight of the adhesive is controlled
within a certain range, the adhesive will exhibit a
reduced peel force and will have a removable behavior
for a short period of time. However, due to the
inherent permanent characteristic of most adhesives,
the adhesion will grow with age and become a non-removable.An alternative is to use a discontinuous coat of
adhesive segments or miscrospheres providing in effect
a reduced coat weight. This approach is based on
adhesion microspheres described in U.S. Patent
3,691,140 to Silver, U.S. Patent 4,166,152 to Baker et
al, U.S. Patent 4,495,318 and 4,598,112 to Howard, U.S.
Patent 4,810,763 to Mallya et al and adhesive segment 
described in European Patent 0180598.The rheological approach has been to design a high
gel, low Tg adhesive which has a low tangent delta at
the debonding frequency. These rheological properties
enable the adhesive to behave like a soft material and
have a low adhesion force during the peel test. This
rheological approach, however, generates problems in
the guillotine process.In other words, good removability and good
guillotinabilty are often properties which are
contradictory to each other. The latter is a must
requirement for all adhesives used in the offset
sheeting business.There have also been other attempts to formulate
an adhesive to reduce the bonding between an adhesive
and knife during the guillotine process. Polyalkalene
glycols such as polyethylene glycol (PEG) have been used
to achieve this property with tackified, water
insoluble elastomers as described in U.S. Patent
4,548,845 to Parsons et al,
but phase separation and incompatibility
between the adhesive system and PEG have limited its
amount and usage. Silicones, as described for instance
in U.S. Patents 4,151,319 to Sackoff and 4,346,189 to
Laurant have
also been suggested. The products display good
guillotinability, and initial repositionability.
Repositionability, however, is lost with time.It would be desirable to provide a pressure-sensitive
adhesive composition which exhibits removable
and repositionable properties which do not deteriorate
with age, as well as good guillotinability for use in
offset printing applications.
