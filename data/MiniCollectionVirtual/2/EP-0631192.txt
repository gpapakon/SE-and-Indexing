<ABSTRACT>
An original forme for electrophotographic planography 
comprising a paper support having thereon a photoconductive 

layer comprising a photoconductive material including at 
least zinc oxide and a resin binder, the exposure ratio of 

the zinc oxide on a surface of the photoconductive layer 
being in the range of from 2.1 to 5%.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an original forme 
for electrophotographic planography, and more particularly to 
an original forme for planography improved in resistance to 
printing scumming and scratching. Processes for preparing printing formes for 
planography by electrophotography have been known, and the 
printing formes are usually obtained according to the 
following method: First, photoconductive layers are 
uniformly charged, subjected to imagewise exposure, and 
developed through a wet process or a dry process to obtain 
toner images, followed by fixing them. Non-image portions 
are then made hydrophilic by desensitizing treatment to 
obtain the printing formes for planography. In the printing 
formes for planography, scumming on the non-image portions 
(referred to as "background scumming") must be avoided. 
However, in the printing formes for planography thus 
obtained, background scumming development has not actually 
been avoided completely. Particularly, the use of an 
exhausted desensitizing solution employed repeatedly, color 
inks in printing, and neutral paper as printed paper has 
frequently resulted in development of background scumming.  
 It is effective against such background scumming to 
repeat the desensitizing treatment twice or more. However, 
this method increases steps to lower operation efficiency, 
and cannot be adopted in automatic printing machines which 
are recently widely used where etching processors for the 
desensitizing treatment are integrated into printers. 
Furthermore, this method also has a problem of impairing 
inking property on image portions. As other methods to prevent background scumming, for 
example, JP-B-50-31011 (the term "JP-B" as used herein means 
an "examined published Japanese patent publication"), 
JP-A-54-20735 (the term "JP-A" as used herein means an 
"unexamined published Japanese patent application") and 
JP-A-58-68046 disclose that improvements in resin binders 
used for photoconductive layers are effective against 
background scumming. However, actual detailed examination of 
the binders shows that the effect of preventing scumming has 
not been fully satisfactory. An object of the present invention is to solve the 
above-described prior art problems and to provide printing 
formes for electrophotographic planography which develop 
little background scumming even by a single cycle of 
desensitizing treatment, and further even by the use of color 
inks, neutral paper, and an exhausted desensitizing solution.
