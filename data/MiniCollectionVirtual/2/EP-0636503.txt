<ABSTRACT>
Method and apparatus wherein a disturbance acting on a tyred 
wheel of a vehicle is estimated by a disturbance 

observer on the basis of the detected angular 
velocity of the wheel. In one form of the method, the wheel 

angular velocity is compensated for the disturbance, 
depending upon the amount of change of the wheel angular 

velocity caused by the disturbance. In another form of the 
method, the angular acceleration of the wheel as well as the 

disturbance is estimated by the observer, and the moment of 
inertia of the wheel is obtained according to a relationship 

between the estimated disturbance and angular acceleration 
of the wheel.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an apparatus 
adapted to detect disturbances or noises which influence a 
tired wheel (hereinafter referred to as "vehicle wheel" or 
"wheel") of a motor vehicle, and a method of using such 
disturbance detecting apparatus. Such apparatus is known from 
US-A-5 218 862. For controlling a motor vehicle, it is useful and 
significant to know the behaviors and changing 
characteristics of the wheels of the vehicle, because the 
wheels are the only components at which the vehicle contacts 
a road surface. However, it is not easy to directly detect 
the behaviors and the changing characteristics of the 
vehicle wheels during running of the vehicle, since the 
wheels are attached to the body of the vehicle through a 
suspension system such that the wheels are displaceable 
relative to the vehicle body, and since the wheels are 
rotated. For a motor vehicle equipped with wheels having 
tires that are inflated by compressed air so as to maintain 
a suitable degree of elasticity, for example, the air 
pressure in the tires has an important effect or influence  
 
on the operating characteristics of the wheels. Accordingly, 
it is desirable to detect the air pressure levels of the 
wheel tires, but the detection of the tire pressure is also 
difficult. The air pressure of a wheel tire may be detected 
by a pneumatic pressure sensor attached thereto. However, it 
is not easy to transmit the output of the sensor on the 
rotating tire to a desired position on the vehicle body 
while the vehicle is running. It is also possible to 
determine the tire pressure on the basis of a change in the 
distance between the road surface and the vehicle body, 
which change occurs due to deformation of the wheel tire as 
the tire pressure is lowered. Further, it is possible to 
estimate a decrease of the tire pressure of one or more 
wheels as compared with the tire pressure of the other 
wheels, depending upon the detected rotating speeds of the 
wheels, based on a fact that the tire pressure decreases 
with an increase in the rotating speed. However, these 
methods do not assure accurate detection of the tire 
pressure. In particular, the latter method does not permit 
the detection of a decrease of the tire pressure of any 
wheel if the tire pressure levels of all the wheels whose 
speeds are detected are lowered. In the light of the difficulty in detecting a 
change in the tire pressure of a vehicle wheel, 
JP-A-62-149502 proposes a tire pressure detecting apparatus 
which operates depending on a
