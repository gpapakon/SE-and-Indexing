<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to Mannich condensation products of 
certain hydroxyaromatic esters. In a further aspect, this 
invention relates to the use of such compounds in fuel 
compositions to prevent and control engine deposits. It is well known that automobile engines tend to form 
deposits on the surface of engine components, such as 
carburetor ports, throttle bodies, fuel injectors, intake 
ports and intake valves, due to the oxidation and 
polymerization of hydrocarbon fuel. These deposits, even 
when present in relatively minor amounts, often cause 
noticeable driveability problems, such as stalling and poor 
acceleration. Moreover, engine deposits can significantly 
increase an automobile's fuel consumption and production of 
exhaust pollutants. Therefore, the development of effective 
fuel detergents or "deposit control" additives to prevent or 
control such deposits is of considerable importance and 
numerous such materials are known in the art. For example, aliphatic hydrocarbon-substituted phenols are 
known to reduce engine deposits when used in fuel 
compositions. U.S. Patent No. 3,849,085, issued 
November 19, 1974 to Kreuz et al., discloses a motor fuel 
composition comprising a mixture of hydrocarbons in the 
gasoline boiling range containing about 0.01 to 0.25 volume 
percent of a high molecular weight aliphatic  
 
hydrocarbon-substituted phenol in which the aliphatic 
hydrocarbon radical has an average molecular weight in the 
range of 500 to 3500. This patent teaches that 
gasoline compositions containing minor amounts of an 
aliphatic hydrocarbon-substituted phenol not only prevent or 
inhibit the formation of intake valve and port deposits in a 
gasoline engine, but also enhance the performance of the 
fuel composition in engines designed to operate at higher 
operating temperatures with a minimum of decomposition and 
deposit formation in the manifold of the engine. Similarly, U.S. Patent No. 4,134,846, issued January 16, 
1979 to Machleder et al., discloses a fuel additive 
composition comprising a mixture of (1) the reaction product 
of an aliphatic hydrocarbon-substituted phenol, 
epichlorohydrin and a primary or secondary mono- or 
polyamine, and (2) a polyalkylene phenol. This patent 
teaches that such compositions show excellent carburetor, 
induction system and combustion chamber detergency and, in 
addition, provide effective rust inhibition when used in 
hydrocarbon fuels at low concentrations. Amino phenols are also known to function as 
detergents/dispersants,
