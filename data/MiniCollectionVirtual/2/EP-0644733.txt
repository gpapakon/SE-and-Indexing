<ABSTRACT>
The stand proposed for holding e.g. compact discs (A) and/or tape cassettes has a preferably rotatably mounted part (1) made up of a multiplicity of bar-shaped elements (7, 8) of two different types. These elements have transversal grooves enabling them to be fitted one on the other in parallel pairs, with alternate pairs at right angles to each other, thus giving two pairs of parallel walls. The elements (7, 8) also have longitudinal ribs (9) located opposite each other in pairs, thus providing lateral supports for the objects (A). The construction of the stand is therefore extremely simple, and the individual components can be provided as a kit which enables the stand to be easily transported and distributed in the unassembled form. A second, smaller, part (2), can be mounted on the first (1) and connected to it. This second part is designed to hold differently shaped objects.
