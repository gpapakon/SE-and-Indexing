<ABSTRACT>
The terminal rail has an insulating housing (10) containing a number of knife contacts (3), receiving the respective insulated cable wires. The knife contacts are formed integral with terminal contacts from a sheet material, each having a pair of forked contact arms, defining a contact slit (5). The contact arms are curved out of the plane of the contact slit along a curvature edge parallel to the latter, in opposite directions to one another, to lie at 90 degrees to the contact slit plane. Pref. each contact slit has opposing contact faces perpendicular to the contact slit plane.

Connecting strip (1) for making insulation-free contact 
to wires, especially of telecommunications, control and 

signal cables, 

with a housing (10) of insulating material and 
a plurality of cut-clamp contact ends (3) which are 
arranged in the housing (10) of insulating material and 

are constructed in one piece with connecting contacts 
(2), wherein the connecting contacts (2) with the cut-clamp 

contact ends (3) are manufactured from an 
essentially lamellar material, wherein before possible 

distortions or deformations are carried out on the 
lamellar material, for the production of the finished 

contact a contact slot plane (12) is defined by a 
central plane runing parallel to the upper and lower 

side of the lamellar material through a contact slot 
(5), wherein 
each cut-clamp contact end (3) has connected 
integrally to one another at one of their longitudinal 

ends two oblong contact limbs (4) which between them 
form a contact slot (5), wherein 
the two longitudinal free ends (19) of the contact 
limbs (4) are bent in opposite directions out of the 

contact slot plane (12) with formation in each case of 
a longitudinal bending edge running essentially 

parallel to the contact slot (5), 
 
characterised in that 


the bending aside of the contact limbs (4) in 
opposite directions by 90ยบ to the contact slot plane 

(12) in each case is performed immediately beside the 
contact slot (5) with adherence to the minimum bending 

radius of the lamellar material. 
Connecting strip according to Claim 1, characterised in 
that the contact slot (5) has contact surfaces (6) 

located opposite one another which run perpendicularly 
to the contact slot plane (12).  

 
Connecting strip according to Claim 1, characterised in 
that the contact slot (5) has contact surfaces (6) 

located opposite one another which run at an angle in

 to the contact slot 
plane (12). 
Connecting strip according to Claim 3, characterised in 
that the angle amounts to 45ยบ. 
Connecting strip according to one of the Claims 1 to 4, 
characterised in that in cross section the contact 

limbs (4) are constructed point-symmetrically with 
respect to the contact slot (5). 
Connecting strip according to one of the Claims 1 to 5, 
characterised in that between each pair of neighbouring 

cut-clamp contact ends (3) a web (11) of the insulating 
material housing (10) is arranged, each two 

neighbouring webs (11) forming a wire introduction 

opening (17) for the cut-clamp contact end (3) situated 
inbetween. 
Connecting strip according to Claim 6, characterised in 
that the wire introduction opening (17) has a region 

(17a) above and a region (17b) below the contact slot 
plane (12), which in cross section each run essentially 

perpendicularly to the contact slot plane (12) and 
which in the direction of the contact slot plane (12) 

and transversely to the contact slot (5) are offset 
with respect to one another, in diametrically opposite 

manner to the relative displacement of the bent contact 
limbs (4) of the cut-clamp contact end (3). 
Connecting strip according to Claim 6 or 7, 
characterised in that in cross section the wire 

introduction opening (17) is constructed point-symmetrically 
with respect to the associated contact 

slot (5).
