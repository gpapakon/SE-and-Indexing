<ABSTRACT>
Locking means for a seat belt retractor having an emergency 
locking mechanism for locking a webbing being pulled out at the time 

of car emergency. This locking means for a retractor comprises a rachet 
wheel (16) and a pawl (32) comprising in turn two teeth. The pawl and 

rachet wheel are designed to be located relative to each other such that 
only one of the two teeth of the pawl is brought into engagement with 

one of the teeth of the rachet wheel with a gap provided between the 
other tooth of the pawl and a tooth of the rachet wheel that confronts 

the same tooth when a load applied to the webbing is small, while the 
two teeth of the pawl are brought into engagement with the teeth of the 

rachet wheel when a load applied to the webbing is great. Therefore, 
since a load applied to one of the teeth becomes a half of a load that 

would be applied to an engaging pawl having a single tooth, the pawl 
of the present invention can bear double the torque, and the outside diameter 

of the rachet wheel can be reduced.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a seat belt retractor for a vehicle.
More particularly, this invention relates to a seat belt retractor
equipped with an emergency locking mechanism for sensitively
detecting sudden changes in acceleration during vehicle collisions,
etc., locking the rotation of the webbing reel shaft and thereby
locking the withdrawal of webbing therefrom.Seat belt devices of vehicles and the like generally have a
construction wherein a webbing is wound on a retractor provided
with an emergency locking mechanism. In this kind of seat belt
device, when the vehicle crashes or stops suddenly the emergency
locking mechanism detects acceleration changes caused by
collision impact forces and operates, stopping the rotation of the
reel shaft on which the webbing is wound so that withdrawal of the
webbing is arrested and the passenger's body is restrained.Examples of publications relating to this type of retractor
include JP-U 5-32176, US-A-5137226, US-A-5154368, US-A-5156356,
and numerous others.To ensure their safety, seat belt retractor strength 
requirements are stipulated by law. With the kind of conventional
mechanism described above, which uses a pawl having one tooth, it
has not been possible to reduce the size of the ratchet wheel while
still satisfying these strength requirements, and consequently it
has naturally also been difficult to reduce the size of the retractor.However, in recent years, 3-point type seat belts having
retractors equipped with emergency lock mechanisms have come to
be widely used for the rear seats of passenger vehicles also, and,
from the point of view of the space required for installing the
retractor, the need to reduce the size of the retractor has become
greater.This invention also relates to a so-called direct-lock
retractor, wherein in a retractor equipped with an emergency
locking mechanism, during an emergency, as well as the webbing
reel shaft being locked the webbing that has been withdrawn from
the webbing reel shaft is also clamped so that the withdrawal of
the webbing is arrested.In general, emergency-lock type seat belt retractors are
designed to restrain the body of the wearer of the seat belt during
an emergency by arresting the withdrawal of the webbing by
locking the webbing reel shaft.However, with this type of retractor there has been the
problem that even when the rotation of the webbing reel shaft is 
locked, when the webbing is subjected to a large load the webbing
itself wound on the webbing reel shaft becomes more tightly wound
and a further

A seat belt retractor for mounting on a vehicle body,
comprising:


a frame (11);
a webbing reel shaft (15) rotatably mounted on the frame;
a lock plate (17) rotatably mounted on the webbing reel shaft;
inertial detecting means (27) for detecting acceleration of the
vehicle body, abnormal inclination of the vehicle body and/or rapid

rotation of the webbing reel shaft in the webbing withdrawal
direction and linking the lock plate to the webbing reel shaft;
locking means for locking the rotation of the webbing reel
shaft when actuated by a rotation of the lock plate accompanying a

rotation of the webbing reel shaft when the lock plate and the
webbing reel shaft are linked toge
ther, the locking means
comprising a ratchet wheel (16) which rotates integrally with the

webbing reel shaft and a pawl (32) pivotally mounted on the frame and
urged away from the ratchet wheel which pawl engages with the 

ratchet wheel guided by a guide hole (20) formed in the lock plate;
a clamp device (36) mounted for clamping the webbing (14) withdrawn
from the webbing reel shaft and a clamp actuator arm (58) for actuating

the clamp device by moving in cooperation with the rotation of the
lock plate, the clamp device comprising first and second clamp

members (44, 43) disposed facing each other with the webbing between
them and a clamp case (37) for holding the first clamp member in such a

way that it can move toward and away from the second clamp
member and holding both of the clamp members in such a way that

they can simultaneously move in the length direction of the
webbing, which clamp actuator arm is pivotally mounted on the

frame and has its end portion (48) fitted in a channel (47) in the first clamp
member and moving in cooperation with the lock plate pivots in the

webbing withdrawal direction and pushes the first clamp member
toward the second clamp member;

   wherein the end portion (48) of the clamp actuator arm has a
circular arcuate surface (51) which in cross section forms part of a

circle C having a diameter greater than the thickness of this end
portion and having its center inclined to the webbing reel shaft

from the centerline A of the clamp actuator arm.
A seat belt retractor according to Claim 1, wherein the
end portion of the clamp actuator arm is provided with a claw (49)

which engages with a portion of the first clamp member and when
the clamp device is not being actuated causes the first clamp

member to move away from the second clamp member. 
A seat belt actuator according to claims 1 or 2, wherein the
clamp actuator arm and the first clamp member only make contact

in their cross direction central portions and the back of the second
clamp member and the frame only make contact in their cross

direction central portions.
