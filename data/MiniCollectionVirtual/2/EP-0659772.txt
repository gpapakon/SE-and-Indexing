<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to
a multi-functional lubricant additive which is a
dispersant, anti-oxidant and an anti-wear viscosity index
(VI) improver when employed in a multigrade lubricating oil
composition.It is well known to those skilled in the art, that
hydrocarbon lubricating oils must be formulated by
addition of various additives to improve their properties.In the case of lubricating oils, typified by those
employed in railway, automotive, aircraft and marine
service, they become degraded during use due inter alia to
formation of sludge which may be generated by
deterioration of the oil or by introductino of undesirable
components from other sources including the fuel or the
combustion air. In order to maintain and improve the
properties of the lubricating oil, various additives have
heretofore been provided, intended to improve the
viscosity index, dispersancy, oxidative stability and
antiwear properties.The art contains many teachings on the use of polymer
additives in lubricating oil compositions. Ethylene-propylene
copolymers and ethylene-alpha olefin non-conjugated diene
terpolymers which have been further derivatized to provide
bifunctional properties in lubricating oil compositions
illustrate this polymer type of oil additive. The art contains many teachings on the use of polymer

copolymers and ethylene-alpha olefin non-conjugated diene
terpolymers which have been further derivatized to provide

of an ethylene-propylene copolymer substrate effective as a
viscosity index improver for lubricating oils.U.S 4,089,794 discloses ethylene copolymers derived
from ethylene and one of more (C3 to C28) alpha olefin solution
grafted with an ethylenically-unsaturated carboxylic acid
material followed by a reaction with a polyfunctional material
reactive with carboxyl groups, such as a polyamine, a polyol,
or a hydroxylamine which reaction product is useful as a sludge
and varnish control additive in lubricating oils.U.S. 4,137,185 discloses a stabilized imide graft of
an ethylene copolymer additive for lubricants.U.S. 4,146,489 discloses a graft copolymer where the
backbone polymer is an oil-soluble ethylene-propylene copolymer
or an ethylene-propylene-diene modified terpolymer with a graph
monomer of C-vinylpyridine or N-vinylpyrrolidone to provide a
dispersant VI improver for lubricating
