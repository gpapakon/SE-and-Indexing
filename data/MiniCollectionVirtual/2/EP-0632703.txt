<ABSTRACT>
There is provided a foldable eating utensil (10) including an elongate handle member (11) having a food-engaging blade (12) extending integrally from one end (13) thereof when operatively disposed, the blade (12) being hingedly connected about a transverse axis (16) to the inner edge (17) of a connector plate (18) of the handle member (11) extending laterally between spaced handle arms (19, 20) of the handle member which define therebetween an opening (21) to receive said blade (12) to lie coplanar with said handle member when said blade is hinged to storage disposition, the blade (12) including a longitudinally extending neck portion (22) at its hinged connection to said connector plate (18) and adapted to lie against said connector plate (18) when operatively disposed, the handle arms being foldable each about a lengthwise axis adjacent said connector plate (18), and the parts being so made and arranged that when the blade (12) has been hinged to operative disposition, said handle arms (19, 20) may be folded digitally towards each other and brought to and held in co-acting relationship in which parts of said handle member (11) engage said blade (12) at its neck portion (22) in such manner as to restrain the blade against movement away from operative disposition.

<DESCRIPTION>
THIS INVENTION relates to eating utensils and in
particular to an eating utensil for the consumption of vended
food products.Many types of foods, such as yoghurt and ice cream, are
packaged in individual serving containers. Eating utensils
of various forms have therefore been devised to be included
with the sale of the containers for immediate consumption of
their contents. Such a utensil may be a plastic spoon, fork
or wooden spatula adapted to be individually issued with each
container. It is desirable, however, to provide a utensil
which may be packaged with the container and is suitably not
larger than one or more specific dimensions of the container.
In particular it is desirable that there be provided an
eating utensil which is planar in storage disposition and is
of suitable size to be packaged with a container and also
foldable to an operative disposition suitable for use in
scooping out contents of the container.The prior art includes two United States Patents Nos.
4,060,176 of Tobiasson J.R. and 4,393,988 of Burke M., each
showing a food container lid which is convertible into a
spoon. The spoon in each case includes a flap which folds
outwardly from the plane of the lid through 180° so that
the flap extends outwardly from the lid to be used as a spoon
bowl to scoop up the contents of the container. Each of
these devices has the disadvantage that the flap is freely
foldable through the 180°, with the result that for 
example, when prising loose a portion of frozen ice
cream from the rest of the contents in the container,
said portion may be suddenly flicked off the flap when
the portion is forcibly caused to become free.In Australian Patent No. 117564 of Stanley Rogers
and Company Pty Ltd there is disclosed a folding utensil
adapted to fold from a storage disposition to an
operative disposition and which includes two members,
namely a handle and a spoon-head removably attached to
each other. Manufacturing this utensil, however,
requires making the two members separately and then
having to couple them together. This increases the costs
of producing the utensil and decreases its reliability in
operation due to the members having to couple together
correctly or otherwise fail to operate.Notwithstanding the prior art as aforementioned, I
have considered there remains a need for substantial
improvements in foldable eating utensils, particularly to
overcome present disadvantages associated with the prior
art. Thus, it is a principal object of my invention to
provide a novel form of eating utentsil

20c;19d,20d) of the handle member which define

therebetween an opening (21) to receive said blade to lie
coplanar with said handle member when said blade is

hinged to storage disposition,

said blade (12;12a;12b;12c;12d) including a
longitudinally extending neck portion

(22;22a;22b;22c;22d) at its hinged connection (16;16b;
16c) to said connector plate (18;18a;18b;18c;18d) and

extending along said connector plate (18;18a;18b;18c;18d)
and comprising engaging portions (26,27;26c,27c;26d,27d)

wherein
when the blade has been hinged to operative
disposition, said handle arms may be folded 

digitally towards each other and brought to and held in
co-acting relationship in which engaging portions of said

handle member engage said blade at its neck portion to
restrain the blade against movement away from operative

disposition.
