<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to diesel fuel compositions
containing high molecular weight, high base number,
substantially ash-free dispersants.Diesel engines are compression-ignition engines.
That is, compression of air within the cylinder generates
the heat required to ignite the fuel as it is injected.
Compression ratios of 12:1 to 23:1 are common. Other
factors affecting combustion in the diesel engine are
combustion chamber design and fuel injection
characteristics. Each of these factors is provided by the
design of the various mechanical components of the engine.
Fuel quality is another factor affecting combustion in
the diesel engine.Fuel additives are employed to improve diesel engine
performance. A wide variety of additives are known,
including cetane number improvers which improve the
ignition quality of the fuel, stabilizers, smoke reducing
additives, corrosion inhibitors and
detergents/dispersants. In the diesel combustion process fuel vaporization
and efficient mixing with available air are essential in
insuring efficient combustion. The fuel injection
equipment provides the mechanical means of achieving this
and its performance is critical in controlling rate of
fuel injection and fuel atomization. Optimum performance
is only achieved when the fuel injection system is free
from deposits and adjusted in accordance with the
manufacturer's recommendations. There is, however, a
tendency for diesel fuels to form deposits during
distribution and combustion and these can markedly affect
the combustion process.Critical deposits can form in two basic areas. A
buildup of gum or resinous degradation products can occur
in the injection system. In severe cases this can result
in sticking of pump plungers and injector pintles or
needles. Problems often only occur on isolated cylinders,
with the resultant misfire causing loss of power and
increased exhaust smoke. Carbon deposits build up on the
parts of the injector exposed to hot combustion gases,
which can affect both fuel flow and fuel atomization
characteristics of the injector. Again, loss in power,
increased exhaust smoke and poor starting are the
noticeable engine performance problems.Deposit buildup in fuel pumps and injectors is not a
new problem, but in recent years it is becoming more
apparent, particularly in areas where fuels containing
increased proportions of cracked components are being
used.Deposit buildup has been evident in both direct and
indirect injection engines. Chemical additives have been
used in attempts to control formation of
