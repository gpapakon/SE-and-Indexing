<ABSTRACT>
A dispense head assembly include a bung adapter (200), a body receiver (300), and a dispensing body (500). The bung adapter (200) inserts into a drum (20). The body receiver (300) selectively inserts into the bung adapter (200), and the dispensing body (500) selectively inserts into the body receiver (300). A single, unobstructured, uniform-diameter flowpath routes fluid from the drum (20) into a chamber (560) within the body receiver (300). A moveable piston (700) within the chamber selectively blocks fluid flow between the fluid flowpath and a dispense opening (566) on the dispensing body (500). The body receiver (300) and the dispensing body (500) are key matched, for safe and rapid coupling and decoupling.

 Specification DRIPLESS CHEMICAL DISPENSE HEAD ASSEMBLYBACKGROUND OF THE INVENTIONEield of the InventionThe present invention relates generally to chemical distribution systems, and more particularly to chemical dispensing apparatus. Still more particularly, the present invention is a chemical dispense head assembly designed to maximize safety, chemical throughput, and ease- of-use.Description of the Prior ArtIn many chemical distribution systems, a drum or tank serves as a chemical source or reservoir. A dispense head assembly that mounts to the drum, such as that described in U.S. Patent No. 5,108,015. selectively controls fluid flow between the drum and chemical distribution piping. Semiconductor manufacturing environments provide well-known examples in which chemical distribution is accomplished in this manner.A dispense head assembly design should satisfy several requirements. A first requirement is the maximization of chemical throughput, which may be especially critical in manufacturing environments. Prior art dispense head assembly designs, however, include flowpath obstructions and/or small-diameter flowpaths that undesirably limit the chemical flow rate.A second requirement is simple, rapid coupling to and decoupling from the drum. Unfortunately, typical prior art dispense head assemblies must be completely screwed into or screwed out of the drum each time the dispense head assembly is coupled to or decoupled from the drum, respectively.Another requirement is the maximization of safety, particularly when dealing with hazardous chemicals. This in turn requires that the dispense head assembly be key-coded, plus leakproof when coupled to the drum, as well as essentially dripless when decoupled from the drum. Unfortunately, the safety performance of some prior art dispense head assemblies has been known to degrade over time. 

 What is needed is a dispense head assembly that couples to a drum in a simple manner and safely provides high fluid flow rates through a large, essentially unobstructed flowpath.SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION The present invention is a dispense head assembly comprising a bung adapter, a body receiver, a wrench safety handle, a dispensing body, a cap, a spring-based plunger unit, and a lever-lock handle. The bung adapter provides an interface to a drum, and comprises a platform having a central opening that runs through a threaded neck. The threaded neck facilitates screw insertion of the bung adapter into the drum, and the central opening provides a fluid flowpath interface to

CLAIMS
1. A dispense head assembly for selectively controlling the flow of fluid between a drum and a fluid distribution pathway, the dispense head assembly comprising: a fluid flowpath coupled to exchange fluid with the drum, the fluid flowpath characterized by a first diameter; a chamber coupled to the fluid flowpath, the chamber having a dispense opening, the chamber characterized by a second diameter; and a plunger that is movabie within the chamber to selectively block fluid flow between the fluid flowpath and the dispense opening.
2. The apparatus of claim 1 , wherein only a single fluid flowpath is present.
3. The apparatus of claim 1 , wherein the fluid flowpath is unobstructed.
4. The apparatus of claim 1, wherein the second diameter is at least as large as he first diameter.
5. The apparatus of claim 1, wherein the dispense opening is at least as large as the first diameter.
6. The apparatus of claim 1, further comprising: a cap coupled to the chamber, the cap having an opening; an actuator rod having a first end coupled to the plunger and a second end protruding through the opening on the cap; and a handle coupled to the actuator rod's second end.
7. The apparatus of claim 6, further comprising a spring, the spring having a first end coupled to the plunger and a second end coupled to the cap.
8. The apparatus of claim 7, wherein the spring forces the plunger to block the fluid flowpath when the handle is in a first position. 

9. The apparatus of claim 8, wherein the plunger also blocks the dispensing opening when the handle is in the first position.
10. The apparatus of claim 8, wherein movement of the handle to a second position compresses the spring and moves the plunger such that fluid can flow between the dispense opening and the fluid flowpath.
11. The apparatus of claim 7, further comprising a leverage post against which the handle is raised and lowered.
12. The apparatus of claim 1 , further comprising a solenoid coupled to the plunger.
13. A dispense head assembly for selectively controlling the flow of fluid between a drum and a fluid distribution pathway, the dispense head assembly comprising: a bung adapter, for insertion into the drum, the bung adapter having a central opening; a body receiver, for selective insertion into the bung adapter; and a dispensing body, for selective insertion into the body receiver.
14. The apparatus of claim 13 , wherein the body receiver comprises: a tray having a central opening; a fluid transfer tube extending from the central opening; and a fin spring surrounding a portion of the fluid transfer tube.
15. The apparatus of claim 14, wherein the tray includes a set of keyed slots. 16. The apparatus of claim 14, wherein the fin spring vertically locks the body receiver into the bung adapter while allowing the body receiver to have freedom of rotational movement.
17. The apparatus of claim 13, wherein the dispensing body comprises: a throat; a dispense opening; and a piston capable of selectively blocking fluid flow between the throat and the dispense opening. 

18. The apparatus of claim 17, wherein the dispensing body further comprises a base portion having a set of key members.
19. The apparatus of claim 17, wherein the piston is coupled to one from a group of a handle and a solenoid.
20. The apparatus of claim 13, further comprising a dip tube coupled to the fluid transfer tube.
