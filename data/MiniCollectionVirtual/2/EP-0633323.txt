<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to spray cooled sub-assemblies of
a hood system for metallurgical vessels utilizing pneumatic
processing of molten metal, e.g. the oxygen treatment of
molten iron in the course of making steel.With the various types of pneumatic processing
metallurgical vessels, for example BOF vessels, it is
necessary to capture the hot exhaust gases generated during
operation and to conduct these gases to exhaust devices
remote from the vessel generating the hot gases. A common
technique for capturing and conducting the exhaust gases is
a hood system arrangement formed of hollow metal members
which are joined together with one end of the system being
open and overlying the portion of the metallurgical vessel
from which hot gases are exiting. The hood system commonly
comprises vertical, oblique and horizontal portions in order
to conform to space restrictions and consequently the
exposure to hot exhaust gases varies from location to
location in the hood system. Hood systems are currently
cooled in order to avoid failure due to exposure to hot
exhaust gases typically through the use of water cooled
elements, e.g. plates, in which water is continuously
circulated through a circuit of closed conduits. The
achievement of effective and efficient cooling is
complicated due to the wide variety of temperature
conditions in different portions of the hood system and the 
extent and irregular configuration of hood systems and the
use of cooling arrangements which apply the same cooling
system to different portions of the hood assembly results in
serious inefficiencies. It is also known to spray cool
roofs and sidewalls of metallurgical vessels using
substantially uniformly arranged spray nozzles which overlay
the entire roof or sidewall and being supplied with coolant
from a common source.The present invention is directed to a hollow hood
assembly for handling hot gases from a metallurgical vessel,
having a plurality of removeable sub-assemblies. Each sub-assembly
comprises an inner metal base member shaped to form
a pre-determined portion of the periphery of a hollow
section and an outer metal covering member spaced from the
base member. Means are provided for joining the outer
covering member to the inner base member and for defining a
substantially enclosed space between the spaced apart base
member and the covering member except for one or more liquid
drain openings located at the lowermost portion of the
enclosed space. A plurality of spray means are located
within the enclosed space at predetermined

<CLAIMS>
A hollow hood assembly (30) for handling hot gases from a pneumatic
processing metallurgical vessel (10), said hollow hood assembly (30) having

a plurality of removeable sub-assemblies (132), a said sub-assembly (132)
comprising:


a) an inner metal base member (142) shaped to form a predetermined
portion of the periphery of a hollow section;
b) an outer metal covering member (152) spaced from and in register with
said base member (142);
c) means for joining the outer covering member (152) to the inner base
member (142) and for defining a substantially enclosed space (60)

between said spaced apart base member (142) and said covering
member (152) with one or more outer liquid drain openings being

located at the lowermost portion of the enclosed space;
d) a plurality of spray means (96) located within said enclosed space (60) at
predetermined locations adjacent to and spaced from said metal base

member (142) for directing a spray of liquid coolant in the form of liquid
droplets against the metal base member (142) to maintain an acceptable

temperature in said metal base member (142);
e) a liquid coolant supply header conduit (90) affixed within said enclosed
space (60) and extending across the metal base member (142) for

supplying liquid coolant to said spray means (96);

independently to said sub-assembly (132) from a liquid coolant supply

source (113) which is located outside of said enclosed space (60) to said
liquid coolant supply header conduit (90) within said enclosed space; 
g) at least one liquid coolant drain receptacle (110) located adjacently
outside of said enclosed space (60) and in communication with said one

or more drain openings for receiving a flow of liquid coolant from inside
of said enclosed space (60);
h) a liquid coolant drain conduit (115) for directly and independently
withdrawing liquid coolant from said drain receptacles (110) of said sub-assembly

(132) and substantially avoiding any buildup of liquid coolant
within said enclosed space (60); and
i) means (80) for removeably closely engaging a said sub-assembly (132) to
said hood assembly (30).
