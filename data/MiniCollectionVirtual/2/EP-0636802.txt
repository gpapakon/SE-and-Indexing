<ABSTRACT>
A slotted conical (non-flat) spring washer (20) with an 
encircling ring (22) provides improved spring washer 

performance. The split or slotted conical spring washer (20) 
is encircled by a retaining ring (22) that prevents the ends 

of the washer adjacent to the slot from expanding as the 
washer is compressed. The ends of the washer on both sides 

of the slot (26) move to prevent the washer material from 
exceeding its yield strength. The ring (22) restricts the 

radial movement of said outside diameter of the washer strip 
away from a center axis of the washer bore. The ring can be 

a counter bore in a member to be clamped, a retaining washer 
having an outside annular washer to act as the ring, or can 

be integral with the spring washer such that the slot appears 
not to pass completely through the washer strip. 
This slotted conical spring washer greatly increases the 
elastic spring travel available during repeated clamping 

cycles and during movement of clamped members due to 
differences in rates of thermal expansion and thermal 

gradients. A method for using the slotted spring washer 
fastening system invention assures electrical conductance 

and/or fluid vessel integrity under high temperatures and 
thermal gradients and when different materials are used in 

the clamped and clamping members.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a fastener component and its 
application or use. Conical spring washers (Belleville washers) are used 
in fastening systems to assure that a compressive force is 
maintained on the clamped members throughout the intended 
service cycle. Once compressed the conical spring washer 
continuously produces a force exerted on its immediately 
adjoining members (a separating force). When a conical 
spring washer is compressed between a bolt head or nut 
securing a clamped member and the clamped member, the 
separating force of the conical spring washer assists in 
clamping the clamped member. The spring washer's effective 
operating travel produces and maintains a force on clamped 
members when there is differential movement (strain) 
between and among the clamped members and the clamping 
member, e.g., a bolt. There is an expectation that the effective operating 
travel (available deflection) and corresponding force 
needed to fully compress the conical spring can always be 
completely recovered when the washer is not compressed. In 
practice, the effective operating travel (or deflection) is 
limited because the compressive hoop stress (the bending 
stress at the convex inner edge) of the washer ("C" - Fig. 
4) typically exceeds the compressive yield strength of the 
washer material at very small deflection values. Likewise,  
 
the tensile hoop stress (the bending stress at the outer 
edge) ("T") typically exceeds the tensile strength of the 
washer material at these small deflections. If either or 
both of these situations occur, the washer material reaches 
the plastic state; the washer does not return to its 
original form and loses some or all of its spring 
properties. Ideally Belleville spring washers are used to maintain 
a predefined clamping force on the clamped members within a 
predetermined range of differential motion of the member on 
each side of the washer. Alternatively, Belleville washers 
are also used in applications where they are initially 
flattened but become the predominant clamping force when 
the clamped and clamping members experience conditions that 
cause them to lose their initial stress (for example when 
the members are subjected to vibration and/or to 
temperature changes and thermal gradients causing 
differential expansion and/or contraction of members). The large thermal cycles and gradients (approx. 300°C) 
between components experienced in processing semiconductor 
wafers (at normal temperatures of 400-500°C) can and do 
cause fastening
