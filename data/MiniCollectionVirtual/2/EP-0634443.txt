<DESCRIPTION>
This application is a continuation-in-part of Serial
No. 08/089914 filed July 12, 1993 in the name of Paul N.
Georgelos.This invention relates to puncture resistant, heat
shrinkable film, and more particularly to such films
having high puncture resistance, high biaxial heat shrink
and good optical properties. The film contains ethylene
alpha olefin copolymer with high molecular weight but a
relatively narrow distribution of molecular weights (low
Mw/Mn).The shrink packaging of food articles such as
poultry, fresh red meat and processed meat products
requires tough, puncture resistant, yet flexible film
materials which are heat shrinkable. Most commonly these
films are fabricated as bags into which the food articles
are placed. The food article-containing bag is then
evacuated and sealed either by clips or more commonly by
heat sealing the bag inner surfaces together across the
bag's open mouth end. The sealed, food article-containing
bag is then heated, for example by hot air,
infrared radiation or hot water, causing the bag to 
shrink in both the machine direction (MD) and the
transverse direction (TD) against the contours of the
contained food article or articles. For many
applications the heat shrunk package must have good
optical properties, either for aesthetic reasons or
functional reasons or both. In some instances the film
must have low haze so that the packaged article may be
periodically inspected to insure continued package
integrity.For example, in commercial poultry shrink packaging
operations, monolayer films formed from polyethylene or
ethylene vinyl acetate polymers have been widely used.
In general, polyethylenes such as linear low density
polyethylene (LLDPE) and high density polyethylene (HDPE)
provide relatively high puncture resistance, high tensile
strength, but relatively low biaxial shrink properties.
On the other hand, ethylene vinyl acetate (EVA) provides
relatively high shrink and limited tensile
strength/puncture resistance. In some instances blends
of various polyethylenes and EVA have been used to obtain
a balance of these desirable properties, but with limited
success.Monolayer films are suitable for poultry packaging.
However for fresh red meat and processed meat packaging,
a high degree of oxygen and moisture barrier protection
is essential, so the common practice has been to use
multilayer films including an oxygen barrier as a core
layer between at least one inner layer and one outer
layer. Oxygen barriers include vinylidene chloride
copolymers such as the vinyl
