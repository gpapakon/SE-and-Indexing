<DESCRIPTION>
In the course of the manufacture of many articles,
including printed circuit boards, the boards, printed circuit
film, or other panels are generally delivered along
a preferably horizontal path, while being horizontally disposed,
as they pass through a chamber in a longitudinal
direction from inlet to outlet. During the course of such
delivery, and particularly with respect to printed circuit
boards, film and the like, it has become commonplace
to etch surface portions of the panels, or boards, removing
metallic material from the upper and lower surfaces
thereof. Generally, such metallic material is copper, and
the etchant can be any of various etchants capable of
removing metallic material from surfaces of the boards.As such boards or panels traverse an etching chamber,
from inlet to outlet, it has been noticed that, because
etchant is being dispersed on the boards from various
spray nozzles, often with fairly uniform application of
etchant, there is a tendancy for perimeter surface portions
of the panels to become etched to greater depths
than central surface portions of the panels. It is believed
that this phenomena is due to upper and lower panel
surfaces generally seeing more etchant at their perimeters
than at central surface portions, as a result of flow
of etchant from central surface portions outwardly over
edges, such that the perimeter or edge portions of the
panels receive not only the spray that is impinged directly
thereon, but also etchant that was sprayed onto central
surface portions of the panels and which runs across
the perimeter portions of the panels, as it leaves the panels
by travelling over perimeter edges.In instances in which the depth of metal on panel
surfaces is of minimal thickness, more greatly etched
perimeter-surface portions of the panels may result in
an undesirable depth of metal being etched from the
panels, leaving the metal surface portions at the perimeters
of the panels too greatly etched, or having insufficient
metal thereon, for proper subsequent uses, such
as for proper carrying of electrical signals, or the like,
especially in instances when the panels are printed circuit
boards.An article entitled "Aetztechnik Fuer Feinstleiter" by
Paul Schwartze, Sindelfingen, Germany, Galvanotechnik, 81(1990) No 11, p 4066-4071 describes
etching techniques for superfine conductors which includes
a fine line etcher. This comprises a horizontal
etching machine consisting of a three chamber etcher.
The first chamber is a pre-etching chamber and the second
and third chambers

A method of spray etching panels, comprising the
steps of:


(a) providing in a spray etch chamber (10),
an upper and lower bank (36) of spray nozzles (37,45);
(b) delivering the panels longitudinally through
the chamber (10) between an inlet (15) and outlet

(16) thereof, in generally horizontal orientation,
along a generally horizontal path of travel

through the chamber (10), vertically spaced
from said upper and lower banks of nozzles (37,45);
(c) spraying the upper and lower
surfaces (6B) of the panels with an etchant spray

spaced vertically relative to the path of travel,
from said banks of nozzles (37,45); and
(d) controlling the amount of etchant spray provided
along perimeter portions (92,94,95) of

the upper and lower surfaces (68) of
the panels;

wherein:

the spray etch chamber (10) comprises a single
generally confined chamber (10); and
the amount of etchant spray provided along perimeter
portions (92,94,95) of the

upper and lower surfaces (68) of the panels is
controlled by:


(i) delivering a reduced amount of etchant
to side surface portions (95) of

the upper and lower surfaces (68) of the
panels relative to the amount of etchant delivered

to center surface portions (96) of
panels through the banks (36) of nozzles

(37,45) wherein the step (i) is accomplished
by providing lower pressure of spray

etchant to outer spray nozzles (37,45) along sides
(17) of the chamber (10) above and below the path

of travel, relative to the pressure of spray etchant provided to
inner spray nozzles (37,45) that are between outer

spray nozzles (37,45), transversely of the chamber
(10); and
(ii) delivering a reduced amount of etchant
to leading and trailing surface portions

(92,94) of the upper and lower
surfaces (68) of the panels relative to the

amount of etchant delivered to center surface
portions (96) of panels through the

same banks (36) of nozzles (37,45) as in
step (i), wherein the step (ii) is accomplished

by intermittently delivering spray etchant
through first spray nozzles (45) at the inlet (15)

to the chamber (10), relative to the delivery of spray
etchant through other nozzles (37) as a panel passes

longitudinally through the chamber (10) between
inlet (15) and outlet (16) thereof

wherein the intermittent delivery
of spray etchant includes sensing the presence

of a panel and responsively operating the first
spray nozzles (45) in response to the sensing, to

deliver less etchant to the leading and trailing surface
portions (92,94) of the panels as panels pass

between chamber inlet (15) and outlet (16).

while the panels pass through the single etch chamber
(10) in one direction between the inlet (15) and outlet (16) thereof. 
The method of claim 1, wherein the step of responsively
operating includes opening and closing the

first spray nozzles (45) when the leading, center
and trailing surface portions (92,94,95) of a panel

have reached predetermined locations along the
path of travel.
The method of claim 1, while pivotally oscillating the
spray nozzles (37,45) transversely of the chamber

therefrom, transversely of the chamber (10).
