<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to an amplifier appropriate for an
output stage, etc., of an audio amplifier.Figure 1 shows an example of a conventional power amplifier.
Shown in Figure 1 is a generally used OCL (output
capacitorless) complementary SEPP (symmetrical single-ended
push-pull) circuit, wherein IN is an input terminal to which
an input signal from the preceding stage is applied and A is
an amplifier. One input terminal + of the amplifier A is
connected to the input terminal IN and is also grounded via a
resistor Rg; the other terminal - is grounded via a resistor
Re.+B and -B are power supplies of opposite polarity to
each other and Q1 and Q2 are output transistors of opposite
polarity to each other. Q1 is an npn transistor and Q2 is a
pnp transistor. The power supplies +B and -B are connected
to the collectors of the transistors Q1 and Q2 so that they
become forward bias polarities with respect to the
transistors Q1 and Q2 respectively. That is, the positive 
electrode of the power supply +B is connected to the
collector of the transistor Q1 and the negative electrode of
the power supply -B to the collector of the transistor Q2.
OUT is an output terminal and RL is a load connected to the
output terminal OUT.A complementary symmetrical circuit consisting of the
transistors Q1 and Q2 has bases connected in common to
provide a signal input terminal, which is connected to an
output terminal of the amplifier A, and emitters connected in
common to provide a signal output terminal, which is
connected via a resistor Rf to the input terminal of the
amplifier A and is also connected to the output terminal OUT.
In the circuit, the transistor Q1 or Q2 operates as an
emitter follower in response to the positive or negative
polarity of an input.An input signal from the preceding stage is applied to
the input terminal IN and is amplified by the amplifier A and
further the output of the amplifier A is amplified by the
output transistors Q1, Q2 at the following stage, then the
result is supplied to the load RL. That is, the current
flowing into the output transistors flows into the load RL.However, at such a power amplifier, a value resulting
from adding a voltage loss at transistors, etc., to the
maximum output voltage is required as a supply voltage. The
supply voltage minus the output voltage is applied between 
the collector and emitter of the output transistor and power
resulting from multiplying the voltage value by output
current becomes a power loss at the output transistor.
