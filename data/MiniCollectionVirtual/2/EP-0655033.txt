<ABSTRACT>
A method of thermal transfert imaging, in which a scanning exposure source, such as a laser is used to effect the thermal transfer of colourant from a donor sheet to a receptor for the thermally transferred colourant. In one aspect, a radiation-absorbing material is incorporated in the receptor sheet such that imagewise exposure of the contacted donor and receptor sheets causes heating in the exposed regions of the receptor to effect thermal transfer of the colourant. In another aspect, the donor sheet comprises a layer of a vapor-deposited colourant and either the colourant itself is capable of absorbing the exposing radiation or the donor sheet further comprises a radiation-absorbing material in a separate underlayer to the colourant layer. Novel constructions of thermal transfer donor sheet and receptor sheets are also descrbied.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method of 
thermal transfer imaging, in which a scanning exposure 
source, such as a laser, is used to effect the thermal 
transfer of colourant from a donor sheet to a receptor 
for the thermally transferred colourant. Thermal transfer imaging involves the imagewise 
transfer of colourant from a donor sheet to a receptor 
sheet under the action of heat, the donor and receptor 
sheets being maintained in intimate, face-to-face contact 
throughout. This type of imaging is increasingly 
popular, mainly because it is "dry" (requiring no 
chemical development) and therefore compatible with the 
home or office environment. The heat required to effect transfer of the 
colourant is usually supplied by contacting the assembled 
(but not bonded) donor and receptor sheets with so called 
"thermal printheads" comprising arrays of miniature 
electrically-heated elements, each of which is capable of 
being activated in a timed sequence to provide the 
desired imagewise pattern of heating. However, such 
systems provide rather poor resolution and increasing 
interest is being shown in the use of radiant or 
projected energy, especially infrared radiation, to 
supply the heat, thereby taking advantage of the greater 
commercial availability of laser diodes emitting in the 
near-infrared region. This is achieved by incorporating 
a radiation-absorbing material in one of the donor and 
receptor sheets, normally the former, and subjecting the 
assembled sheets to an imagewise pattern of radiation. 
When the assembled sheets are irradiated by radiation of 
an appropriate wavelength, then the radiation-absorbing 
material converts the incident energy to thermal energy 
and transfers the heat to colourant in its immediate 
vicinity, causing imagewise transfer of the colourant to 
the receptor.

disclosed in British Patent No. 1385533; British Patent 
Publication No. 2083726; European Patent Publication Nos.
