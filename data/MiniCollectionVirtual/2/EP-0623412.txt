<ABSTRACT>
A rotary metal cutting tool comprises an elongate 
body (1) having at one end a shank (2) adapted to be clamped 

in a machine tool and a cutting head (3) provided at the other 
end of the body; at least one channel (4) provided in the head 

to receive a cutter blade (5); a recess (7) in the body (1); 
at least one clamping cotter (9) located in the recess (7) and 

serving to clamp the blade (5), by wedge action, against a 
seating surface (10) of the channel (4) by means of a clamping 

face (11) of the cotter engaging an opposite face (12) of the 
blade (5) to that engaging the seating surface (10); means 

(12) to urge the cotter into wedge clamping 
engagement with the blade (5); the recess and cotter each 

having at least one flat (13, 14) to prevent cotter rotation; 
and the clamping cotter (9) having a clamping surface (11) of 

extended length (16) terminating with the lower end 
face (17) of the cutting head (3).

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a rotary metal cutting tool
according to the precharacterising portion of claim 1; see GB 2180177B.Such a tool comprises a body having at least one
channel in which is clamped a replaceable cutter blade -
typically a part-helical, carbide insert - and although this
known tool has enjoyed considerable commercial success over a
number of years, it is capable of further improvement. For
instance in the machining of light alloy, swarf has been known
to penetrate a tolerance gap between the tool body and cutter
blade, frequently resulting in the blade being jammed in its
recess even after removal of its clamping screw, due to the
need to provide tolerance for the reasonably easy fitting of
a replacement blade and the fact that, when using two axially
spaced-apart clamping cotters for a blade of substantial axial
length, the lower cotter was spaced above the lower end face
of the tool head. In addition, in the fitting of a
replacement blade, care had to be taken to ensure non-rotation
of the securing cotter upon tightening of the cotter-locking
screw, as any such rotation would tend to lift the adjacent
blade from out of its seat.Consequently, a basic object of the present invention
is to provide a rotary metal cutting tool of the
aforementioned type but of further improved construction.According to the present invention there is provided a
rotary metal cutting tool comprising;
(i) an elongate body having at one end a shank 
adapted to be clamped in a machine tool and a
cutting head provided at the other end of the
body; (ii) at least one channel provided in the head to
receive a cutter blade; (iii) a recess in the body; (iv) a clamping cotter located in the
recess and serving to clamp the blade by wedge
action, against a seating surface of the channel
by means of a clamping face of the cotter
engaging an opposite face of the blade to that
engaging the seating surface;(v) means to urge the cotter into wedge clamping
engagement with the blade; characterised in that:(vi) the recess and its cotter each hav
flats to prevent cotter rotation; and(vii) the clamping cotter has a clamping surface that is
extended so as to terminat with the lower end
face of the cutting head.Thus, with the tool in accordance with the invention,
firstly the tolerance gap of the prior art construction
between the lower end face of the tool head and the blade is
eliminated by extending the clamping face of the clamping
cotter (or the lower clamping cotter if two clamping cotters
per blade are employed) to the

A rotary metal cutting tool comprising:

(i)
 an elongate body (1) having at one end a shank (2) adapted to be clamped in a machine
tool and a cutting head (3) provided at the other end of the body;
(ii)
 at least one channel (4) provided in the head (3) to receive a cutter blade (5);
(iii)
 a recess (7) in the body;
(iv)
 a clamping cotter (9) located in the recess (7) and serving to clamp the blade (5) by
wedge action, against a seating surface (10) of the channel (5) by means of a clamping

face (11) of the cotter (9) engaging an opposite face (12) of the blade (5) to that engaging
the seating surface (10);
(v)
 means (13, 14) to urge the cotter (9) into wedge clamping engagement with the blade (5);
characterised in that:
(vi)
 the recess (7) and its cotter (9) each have flats (15, 15A; 16, 16A) to prevent cotter
rotation; and

with the lower end face (17) of the cutting head (3).
A tool as claimed in Claim 1, wherein the or each blade (5) has an axial length such
that a second, clamping cotter (8), axially spaced from the cotter (9), is provided.
A tool as claimed in Claim 1 or Claim 2, wherein two blades (5) are provided 180°
apart.
A tool as claimed in Claim 1 or Claim 2, wherein three blades (5) are provided 120°
apart.
