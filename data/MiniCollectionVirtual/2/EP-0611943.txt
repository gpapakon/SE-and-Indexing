<ABSTRACT>
A flexible shield for protection against penetration by a 
weapon such as a knife comprises three arrays (AY1,BY1, 

CY1; AX2,BX2,CX2; AY3,BY3,CY3,DY3) of protective plates 
arranged in separate layers (1,2,3) on flexible supports 

(22,23 etc). The first array (1) of plates provides 
protection over area covered by each of its plates but 

permits penetration along lines of weakness between the 
plates and particularly at intersections of such lines of 

weakness. The second array (2) of protective plates is 
coextensive with the first array and in a corresponding 

regular pattern to provide protection over area covered 
by each second plate. The first and second arrays are 

mutually offset such that an intersection between lines 
of weakness in the first array coincides with plates of 

the second array to provide protection at said 
intersections. The plates of the third array (3) are 

arranged at intersections between lines of weakness of 
the first array with lines of weakness of the second 

array.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a flexible shield for protection 
against penetration. A typical application for the 
protective shield is in protective clothing to guard the 
wearer against a knife attack. Conventional body armour intended primarily to protect 
against gun-shot wounds is not effective against a knife 
attack because the sharpness of a knife tends to cut its 
way through the body armour. Chain mail is effective 
against knife attacks but tends to be very heavy and its 
complex structure makes it very costly. Of course, a 
rigid metal plate can be effective against such an attack 
but it is very cumbersome and inconvenient to wear. It is already known to provide flexible body armour in 
which primary protection is provided by metal plates 
arranged in a matrix. It is also known, for example from 
Lonza GB A 915345, to provide body armour constituted by 
layers of plates offset from one another to cover gaps in 
one layer with plates in another layer. It is also known 
from Fritch US A 4660223, to make flexible body armour 
from plates of a range of different sizes with a variety 
of overlap patterns. An object of the invention is to provide an improved  
 
flexible shield for protection against penetration, for 
example from a knife or other sharp pointed object. The invention is concerned with a flexible shield for 
protection against penetration comprising an arrangement 
of overlapping protective plates carried on a flexible 
support. The invention is characterised by an arrangement 
of plates and support as follows:
 
   a first array of protective first plates carried by 
a flexible support in a regular pattern to provide 
protection over area covered by each first plate, 
but permitting penetration along lines of weakness 
between the first plates and particularly at 
intersections of such lines of weakness;
 
   a second array of second protective plates carried 
by a flexible support generally coextensive with the 
first array and in a corresponding regular pattern 
to provide protection over area covered by each 
second plate;
 
   the first and second arrays being mutually offset 
such that intersections between lines of weakness in 
the first array coincide with plates of the second 
array to provide protection at said intersections;
 
   and a third array of third protective plates  
 
carried by a flexible support and coextensive with 
the first and second arrays, the third protective 
plates being arranged at intersections between lines 
of weakness of the first array with lines

<CLAIMS>
A flexible shield for protection against penetration 
comprising an arrangement of overlapping protective 

plates carried on a flexible support characterised by an 
arrangement of plates and support as follows: 

   a first array (1, i.e. AY1 etc) of protective first 
plates carried by a flexible support (23,24) in a 

regular pattern to provide protection over area 
covered by each first plate, but permitting 

penetration along lines of weakness (11,12) between 
the first plates and particularly at intersections 

(13) of such lines of weakness; 
   a second array of second protective plates (2, i.e. 

AX2 etc) carried by a flexible support (25,26) 
generally coextensive with the first array and in a 

corresponding regular pattern to provide protection 
over area covered by each second plate; 

   the first and second arrays being mutually offset 
such that intersections (e.g. 13) between lines of 

weakness in the first array coincide with plates 
(e.g. CX2) of the second array to provide protection 

at said intersections;
 

   and a third array of third protective plates (3, 
i.e. AY3 etc) carried by a flexible support (27,28) 

and coextensive with the first and second arrays, 
the third protective plates being arranged at 

intersections (14) between lines of weakness (11) of 
the first array with lines of weakness (15) of the 

second array. 
A shield as claimed in Claim 1 wherein each array is 
a rectangular array. 
A shield as claimed in Claim 2 wherein each plate is 
generally rectangular. 
A shield as claimed in any one of the preceding 
claims wherein each array is carried by its own 

respective flexible support which comprises two layers of 
flexible fabric united to form pockets to receive the 

elements. 
A shield as claimed in claim 4 wherein the pockets 
are formed by stitching the two layers of fabric 

together. 
A shield as claimed in claim 4 or claim 5 wherein 
the material of the flexible supports is Aramid or 

polyethylene. 
A shield as claimed in any one of the preceding 
claims wherein each protective element is formed of 

metal. 
A flexible shield as claimed in claim 7 wherein the 
metal is titanium or titanium alloy or aluminium alloy. 
A protective garment constructed from a shield in 
accordance with any one of the preceding claims.
