<ABSTRACT>
A videoendoscopic knot pusher comprises a main body (300) and 
first and second fingers (312, 322) whose ends are shaped in a 

smooth rounded shape to guide a suture and knot into position 
with a patient's body. The finger members (312, 3322) define 

either a 'V'-shaped cleft or a smooth walled channel (330) 
between them for grasping the suture. Second and third channels 

(340, 350) or a spiral channel formed 'upstream' of the finger 
members retain the suture in the fingers even during retraction 

of the main body for retaining control of the suture even if the 
suture slips out of the grasp of the channels.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a knot pusher for use in 
videoendoscopic surgery. The key 
element of the embodiments in structure for retaining a positive 
grip on the knots to be pushed through the sheath, which remains 
after removal of the trochar, and into the body of the patient 
receiving the surgical procedure. The present invention relates to the field of knot pushers used 
in videoendoscopic surgery. Videoendoscopic surgerey is surgery 
performed through a number of small openings formed in the 
patient's body by a small tube (trochar) with surgical blades 
on the end. Initially, for either abdominal or chest surgery, 
an incision is made in the skin and the bladed end of a trochar, 
which has a sheath on its outside, is inserted into to the body 
to form one of the working incisions. The incisions made are 
quite small, usually, of the order of between 5 and 12 mm. The 
entire surgical procedure is performed by instruments inserted 
through the trochar's sheath and into the patient's body 
including the cutting, sewing, cauterizing and removal of any 
tissue, fluids, etc. If the surgery is intra-abdominal, 
distension of the cavity is obtained by pumping carbon dioxide 
into the cavity to inflate it slightly in order to give the 
surgeons space in which to work. To maintain this pressure, all 
devices inserted through the trochar's sheath must be sealed. 
For this purpose, such sheaths have valves formed on them to 
close around the instruments inserted through them. In order for the surgeon to observe the work area and his 
instruments, some sheaths must have light brought through them 
into the body and a camera image brought out. The operating 
surgeon and his team watch the surgery on a two dimensional  
 
screen, usually a video screen. The conventional larger field 
surgery uses the three dimensional image that is obtained by 
opening the patient up with a large incision. The advantages to 
the patient of the videoendoscopic techniques are well known. Most surgical procedures require the tying of knots to close 
incisions, to repair torn tissues, to re-attach tissue, to stop 
bleeding, etc. In videoendoscopic surgery, the knots can be tied 
either inside the body or tied outside of the body and pushed 
through the sheath to the site to be tied. Because it is far 
simpler for the surgeon to work outside of the body than inside, 
the surgeon will prefer to tie the surgical knot outside of the 
body and push it through the sheath to the proper site. Learning 
techniques and skills to tie

<CLAIMS>
A knot pusher (100;200;200;400) for use in videoendoscopic 
surgery, comprising: 

   a main body member (102;202;302;402) formed of a rigid 
material suitable for sterilization; 

   one end of the main body member formed into first and 
second outwardly extending finger members (110,120;210,220;310, 

320;410,420); 
   the first and second finger members each have rounded 

and tapered ends (112,122;212,222;312,322;412,422) formed 
thereon. 
The knot pusher claimed in claim 1, wherein: 
   a 'V'-shaped cleft (126;226) is formed between the first 

and second finger members (110,120;210,220). 
The knot pusher claimed in claim 1, wherein: 
   a first 'U'-shaped slot (330;430) is formed between the 

first and second finger members (310,320;410,420). 
The knot pusher claimed in claim 1, wherein: 
   a rigid elbow (270) is formed in the main body member 

(200) adjacent and upstream the first and second finger members. 
The knot pusher claimed in claim 3, wherein: 
   the first 'U'-shaped slot (330) is formed on an upper 

surface of the main body member (300); 
   a second 'U'-shaped slot (350) is formed in the bottom 

of the main body member (300); 
   a third transverse slot (340) is formed in the main body 

member (300) to interconnect the first and second 'U'-shaped 
slot members (330,350). 
The knot pusher claimed in claim 3, wherein: 
   a spiral groove (440) is formed in the outer surface of 

the main body member (400) in a right hand direction of 
rotation; 

   the spiral groove (440) communicates at one end with the 
first'U'-shaped slot member (430). 
The knot pusher claimed in claim 2 for pushing knots 
formed in surgical suture material which has a diameter, 

wherein: 
   the 'V' cleft (126;226) has a width only slightly larger 

than the diameter of the suture material. 
The knot pusher claimed in claim 3 for pushing knots 
formed in surgical suture material which has a diameter, 

wherein: 
   the 'U'-shaped channel (330;430) has a width only 

slightly larger than the diameter of the suture material.
