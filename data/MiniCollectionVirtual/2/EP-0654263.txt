<ABSTRACT>
A process for the manufacture of particles comprises mechanically working a mixture 
of a drug and a hydrophobic and/or hydrophilic fusible carrier in a high speed mixture 

so as to form agglomerates, breaking the agglomerates to give controlled release 
particles and optionally continuing the mechanical working with the optional addition 

of a low percentage of the carrier or diluent.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates generally to a method of manufacturing pharmaceutical
dosage forms, for human or veterinary use, preferably sustained release particles, such
particles having diameters ranging from 0.1 to 3.0mm. Such particles may contain
analgesics, such as morphine, or other active ingredients. The present invention also
relates to dosage forms obtained by processing of the aforesaid particles, such as
tablets, suppositories or pessaries.Patent Application PCT/SE93/00225 published under No. WO 93/18753 describes a
process for the preparation of sustained release pellets which comprises pelletising a
mixture containing the drug in finely divided form and a binder; the process is
characterised in that:
(a) the binder is in particle form consisting of one or more water-insoluble or
water-soluble, wax-like binder substance(s) with a melting point above 40°C and(b) the pelletisation step is performed by mechanically working the mixture, in a
so-called high-shear mixer, under the input of a sufficient amount of energy for
the binder to melt and pelletisation to take place.Patent Application PCT/SE91/0069 published under No. WO 92/06679
describes a similar process.Processes of this kind are sometimes referred to as "melt-pelletisation" processes.
We have found that operating according to these processes using commercial
manufacturing equipment with a standard stainless steel interior, which is also the
method described in Schaefer et al. (Drug Development and Industrial Pharmacy,
16(8), 1249-1277 (1990) and Taggart et al. (International Journal of Pharmaceutics 19
(1984) 139-148), results in yields of pellets in the preferred size range of only about
30 to 60% compared with the theoretical. Use of a wider particle size range to
improve the yield results in an erratic in vitro release rate and irreproducible
performance. There is, therefore, a need for a commercial process for producing satisfactory controlled
release particles which has a much higher yield. One object of the invention is, therefore, to
provide a process which has an improved yield and preferably produces a product with
reproducible controlled release characteristics.U.S. 4,132,753 describes a process of preparing granules of controlled release medicament by
continually agitating a mixture of powdered medicament and finely divided wax-like material
while subjecting the mixture to radiation heating.The present invention provides a process for the manufacture of sustained release particles,
which comprises
(a) mechanically working
</DESCRIPTION>
<CLAIMS>
A process for the manufacture of sustained release particles, which comprises

(a) mechanically working in a high-speed mixer, a mixture of a particulate
drug and a particulate, hydrophobic and/or hydrophilic fusible carrier or diluent

having a melting point from 35 to 150°C and optionally a release control
component comprising a water-soluble fusible material or a particulate, soluble

or insoluble organic or inorganic material, at a speed and energy input which
allows the carrier or diluent to melt or soften whereby it forms agglomerates;
(b) removing agglomerates from the mixer and comminuting them to give
controlled release particles; and optionally
(c) continuing mechanically working optionally with the addition of carrier
or diluent in an amount of between 5% and 75% w/w of the total amount of

ingredients; and optionally
(d) repeating steps (c) and possibly (b) one or more times.
A process according to claim 1, wherein during the mechanical working, heat is
supplied thereto by microwave radiation.
A process according to claim 2, wherein only part of the heating is supplied by
microwave radiation.
A process according to any one of claims 1 to 3, wherein the drug is morphine tramadol,
hydromorphone, oxycodone, diamorphine or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt of any

one of these. 
A process according to any one of claims I to 4, wherein the hydrophobic fusible
carrier(s) or diluent(s) is a wax.
A process according to claim 5, wherein the wax is chosen from hydrogenated vegetable
oil, hydrogenated castor oil, Beeswax, Carnauba wax, microcrystalline wax and glycerol

monostearate.
A process according to any one of claims 1 to 6, wherein the water-soluble fusible
material optionally included in the mixture in step (a) is PEG having a molecular weight

of from 1000 to 20000, preferably 1000 to 6000, or a poloxamer.
A process according to any one of claims 1 to 7 wherein the fusible carrier or diluent is
added stepwise during mechanical working.
A process according to any one of claims 1 to 8, which further comprises the step of
compressing the sustained release particles obtained by the process of any one of claims

1 to 8 to produce a solid, unitary dosage form.
A process according to any one of claims 1 to 8, which further comprises the step of
filling sustained release particles obtained by the process of any one of claims 1 to 8 into

a capsule.
