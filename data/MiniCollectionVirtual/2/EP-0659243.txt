<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a pad wear detector (10) for a disc brake with an adjusting device (3, 6) in which the brake shoe gap is kept substantially constant by means of at least one axially acting adjuster (1) and which is coupled to the pad wear detector (10) in such a way that the latter detects the relative axial position of the adjuster (1) and derives a corresponding wear signal therefrom. To facilitate maintenance, the invention proposes that the pad wear detector (10) be arranged in a separate housing (11) releasably secured to the disc brake and actuated by the adjuster (3, 6) via a releasable coupling component (11, 22).

Pad wear detector (10) for a disk brake, comprising an adjusting means
(3, 6) which maintains the ventilation gap of the brake shoes substantially

constant by means of at least one adjuster 
(1)
 acting in the axial direction
and coupled to the pad wear detector 
(10)
 in such a way that the
latter detects the relative axial position of said adjuster 
(1)
 and derives
therefrom a corresponding wear signal, with the pad wear detector 
(10)

being arranged in a separate housing 
(11)
 detachably secured to a lid
element 
(5b)
 of the disk brake by means of a snap-on fastening means

(41, 42)
 and being adapted for being actuated by said adjusting means

(3, 6)
 via a releasable coupling component 
(21, 22)
,
characterised in that

said housing 
(11)
 is fastened for rotation on said lid element 
(5b)
 of the
disk brake.
Pad wear detector according to Claim 1, 
characterised in
 that the pad
wear detector 
(10)
 is fastened inside said housing 
(11)
 and co-operates
therewith for forming an integral component.
Pad wear detector according to Claim 2, 
characterised in
 that the pad
wear detector 
(10)
 is fastened inside said housing 
(11)
 by means of a
snap-on fastening means 
(31, 32)
.
Pad wear detector according to Claim 1, 
characterised in
 that said housing

(11)
 is rotatable through 360Â°. 
Pad wear detector according to Claim 1 or 4, 
characterised in
 that said
housing (11) is rotatable in steps by means of a latching means, preferably

in the form of a locking serration means 
(51, 52)
.
Pad wear detector according to any of the Claims 1 to 5, 
characterised in

that a sealing member 
(60)
 in the form of an O-ring, a square ring or the
like is disposed between said housing 
(11)
 and its seat on the disk
brake.
Pad wear detector according to any of the Claims 1 to 7, 
characterised in

that a cable duct 
(71)
 formed in said housing 
(11)
 comprises a seal 
(72)

for the signal line(s) of the detector.
Pad wear detector according to any of the Claims 1 to 7, 
characterised in

that said housing 
(11)
 is made of a plastic material.
Pad wear detector according to any of the Claims 1 to 8, 
characterised in

that said adjusting means 
(3, 6)
 adjusts said adjuster(s) 
(1)
 by way of a
rotating movement, with the pad wear detector 
(10)
 comprising a rotational
drive for detecting the respective angle of rotation, and wherein

said coupling component consists of a pinion 
(21)
 which engages in a
corresponding internal toothing 
(22)
 of the pad wear detector 
(10)
.
Pad wear detector according to Claim 9, 
characterised in
 that the pad
wear detector 
(10)
 comprises a revolving potentiometer 
(12)
.
Pad wear detector according to Claim 10, 
characterised in
 that a reduction
gear 
(13)
, preferably in the form of a cycloid-type gearing, is disposed
between said revolving potentiometer 
(12)
 and said coupling
component 
(21, 22)
. 
Pad wear detector according to Claim 11, 
characterised in
 that said
reduction gear 
(13)
 is supported in a bearing device which carries said
reduction gear 
(13)
 so as to prevent it from rotation whilst displaceability
in the longitudinal and transverse directions is maintained.
Pad wear detector according to Claim 12, 
characterised in
 that said
reduction gear 
(13)
 and its bearing device co-operate with said revolving
potentiometer 
(12)
 so as to form an integral component, and are fastened
inside said housing 
(11)
 together with said potentiometer.
