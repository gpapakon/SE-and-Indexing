<ABSTRACT>
The present invention is a novel latch and air vane system for a disk drive 
actuator assembly which releases automatically in response to the aerodynamic 

force generated by the rotation of the storage disk. The latch and air vane system 
latches and recaptures the actuator assembly and holds the arm and transducer 

supported thereby in a fixed position. The latch and air vane system comprises a 
latch journaled for rotation immediately adjacent the disk and including a latch 

arm extending substantially perpendicular the direction of movement of the 
actuator assembly when the actuator assembly is at rest with the transducer resting 

on the landing zone, a centre shaft to allow the latch to rotate, and an air vane. 
The latch arm has a latch finger at one end thereof engaging a notch on the 

perimeter of the actuator assembly pivot region. The air vane extending in the 
opposite direction from the centre shaft comprises a flag adjacent the space 

between the rotating disks and has a flag finger supported near the bottom of the 
flag and inserted in the region between the disks so that air flow generated by the 

rotation of the disks presses against the air vane and causes the air vane to move 
away from the edge of the rotating disks. In this way rotation of the disks causes 

the latch finger to move away from the notch releasing the actuator assembly for 
movement of the transducer across the surface of the disk. The latch and air vane 

mechanism is also intended to withstand considerable shock without allowing the 
actuator assembly to be dislodged, thereby preventing damage to data storage 

disks.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a disc drive comprising a latch system.It is known in the art that air flow is generated incident to the rotation of
data storage discs in a disc drive. The characteristics of the air flow have been
analysed and discussed in the prior art, see for example, U.S. Patent 4,647,997 to
Westwood and the IBM Journal of Research and Development, November 1974,
pages 480-488. It is known that two commonly mounted spaced apart rotating
discs generate a significantly greater air flow than generated by a single rotating
disc, and that the amount of air flow is also known to be a function of disc
diameter and angular velocity. The air flow force is greatest adjacent the
periphery of the rotating disc and especially at the region defined between two
rotating discs, and falls off rapidly as a non-linear function as one moves away
from the disc periphery.In rotating, non-removable data disc storage devices, a data read/write
transducer files upon an air cushion or bearing in extremely close proximity to the
data surface. In many disc drives, including those which are of extremely small
size, the transducer lands upon and takes off from a particular predefined landing
region. It is possible, when shocks are applied to the disc drive, that the
transducer can move or bounce across the surface of the disc, causing erosion or
scarring of the magnetic film coating on the disc surfacing leading to hard and
soft data failures. In addition, the hard transducer head may dent the surface in
response to sharp jarring forces attributable to sharp or rough handling of the
drive.While aerodynamically actuated latches have been described in the above
referenced Westwood patent as well as in U.S. Patent 4,538,193, such latches
have not been effective because of a lack of the sensitivity and responsiveness to
the limited air flow in extremely small size disc drives. It has been found that the
air flow values in such small disc drives must be carefully accounted for and are, 
in many cases, too small in magnitude to effectively, reliably and responsively release the
actuator when the discs begin rotation. Further, the spring force that restrains the transducer
actuator assembly in the landing zone must be carefully selected so that the force can be
overcome when the discs begin to move.Thus, a need has arisen for a reliable, responsive, air flow responsive latch
mechanism responsive to the air flow generated in a small form factor disc drive to reliably
latch and release the actuator mechanism, while

<CLAIMS>
A disc drive having:

one or more discs (10), each disc rotatable about a spindle (5);
one or more actuator arm assemblies (40), each having at least one transducer
arranged so as to co-operate with a respective disc; and
a latch system, the latch system comprising a latch arm (64) rotatable about an axis
(70) and having an engagement portion (61) for engaging the actuator arm assembly to

substantially prevent movement of the actuator arm assembly, and a vane (66) located at a
distance from the spindle (5) which is greater than the radius of the discs, and the latch arm

(64) and vane (66) are arranged such that, in the presence of disk rotation-generated wind
pressing against the vane, the vane moves away from the disc and the engagement portion

(61) disengages the actuator arm assemblies; characterised in that the axis of rotation (70)
of the latch system is within the radius of the discs.
A disc drive as claimed in claim 1, in which said vane (66) is disposed substantially
parallel to the circumference of the discs.
A disc drive as claimed in claim 1 or 2, wherein the air vane further comprises a

finger (67) located on the side of the vane (66) for making contact with the disc rotation-generated
wind to guide the wind toward the vane.
A disc drive as claimed in claim 3, wherein said finger (67) has opposing surfaces
which, from a section of the finger closest to the centre of the disc or discs to a section

closest to the vane (66), curve gradually away from each other towards said vane and are
thereby shaped to capture and direct the wind generated by rotation of said disc or discs

against said vane.
A disc drive as claimed in claim 3 or 4, wherein the finger (67) is arranged for being
inserted in a space between two discs. 
A disc drive as claimed in any one of claims 3, 4 or 5, wherein the finger (67) is
supported on the surface of the vane (66) close to a base housing (3,4) of the disc drive.
A disc drive as claimed in any preceding claim, further comprising a biasing means
(76) for urging the vane (66) towards a position at the periphery of the disc at which the

vane does not contact the disc or discs, and for urging the engagement portion (61) to
engage the actuator arm assembly (40).
A disc drive as claimed in claim 7, wherein said biasing means comprises a coil
spring.
A disc drive as claimed in claim 7 or 8, wherein the force of the biasing means is
defined to be less than the effective force of the wind created by the rotation of the discs at

normal speed to allow use of the disc drive.
A disc drive as claimed in any preceding claim, wherein the vane is shaped to follow
the contour of the edge of the rotating disc or discs.
A disc drive as claimed in any preceding claim, further comprising a restraining
means (104,106) to prevent the flag (66) from contacting the disc or discs (10, 30).
A disc drive as claimed in any preceding claim, wherein the latch arm (64)
engagement portion (62) engages the actuator arm assembly (40) at a point (50, 90) formed

in the transducer support arm supporting pivot.
