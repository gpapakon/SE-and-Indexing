<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a device for filling 
spacer frames for insulating glass with hygroscopic 
material. Said spacer frames usually comprise hollow profiled 
bars which are usually joined at one or more corners by 
means of angles made of plastics or metal. Said frames thus have a first wall lying externally to 
the insulating glass, a second wall arranged inside the 
insulating glass, and two third lateral walls arranged 
adjacent to the glass sheets that form the insulating glass. Hygroscopic material must be poured inside the spacer 
frames, and adapted holes are formed at the second inner 
wall so as to maintain the required degree of humidity 
inside the insulating glass. For this purpose, it is known to manufacture spacer 
frames which are appropriately folded on three sides, 
leaving the ends adjacent at one corner disconnected and 
particularly so that one of the two ends is not folded and 
thus protrudes beyond the perimetric edge of the other one. This allows to load the hygroscopic material on two 
sides of the frame, i.e. at the sides whose ends are free: 
once this operation has been performed, one of the two ends 
is folded and connected to the other by means of an adapted 
metal or plastic insert. However, this method has considerable drawbacks: first 
of all the frame is loaded with hygroscopic material only at 
two of its four sides and after filling it is furthermore 
necessary to perform additional work steps that can for  
 
example cause the accidental loss of part of this 
hygroscopic material. As a partial solution to these drawbacks, it is known 
to manufacture frames that are again folded so as to form a 
geometrical shape that is open at one corner; an L-shaped 
closing insert can be associated at the free ends. The hygroscopic material is again loaded before 
assemblying the L-shaped insert; however, even this solution 
has the drawbacks mentioned above and thus allows to fill 
the frame with hygroscopic material only on two sides, with 
the additional drawback due to the difficulty of 
hermetically sealing the frame at the corner even when it is 
sealed with a local injection of butyl. Furthermore, should one wish to fill each individual 
side of the frame with hygroscopic material, the frame would 
have to be formed by multiple elements that were 
subsequently mutually associable by using angular inserts 
that allow coupling to the following side. Even this solution, however, would not be optimum, 
since on one hand it would not be possible to seal the frame 
her
