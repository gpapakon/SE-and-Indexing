<ABSTRACT>
A sterile wound packing material (10) and package (20) 
therefor is provided, which wound packing is in the form of a 

gauze or similar absorbent material (12) and may be 
impregnated with a partially or substantially dehydrated 

hydrogel material (14) for absorbing wound exudate. The 
wound packing (10) is capable for absorbing large amounts of 

wound exudate without inhibiting the healing of the wound to 
which it is contacted and without the need for additional 

backing or adhesive layers. The wound packing also has a 
pliable, soft structure which permits the packing to be 

applied to wounds having irregular shapes and depths.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a sterile wound packing
and a package therefore, and, more particularly to a wound
packing in the form of a gauze or other similar absorbent
material having a hydrogel material impregnated therein for
absorbing wound exudate and to a package for dispensing the
wound packing.Secreting skin wounds, such as decubitus ulcers and open
surgical wounds, have long presented a medical challenge in
keeping such wounds sterile and relatively dry. Deep wounds
provide an even greater challenge. The accumulation of wound
exudate, such as blood, pustulation, and other wound fluids,
in wound crevices, promotes growth of bacteria and other
organisms which cause infection and delay the healing
process. Such wound exudate may also cause maceration of
tissue adjacent the wound and support infection thereof.However, since it is often desirable to allow a wound to
heal in a slightly "moist" or occlusive state, which is
believed to accelerate healing, excess wound exudate must be
removed. If excess wound exudate remains in or on a wound, a
"blister" of exudate can form under the wound dressing which
is not only unsightly, but also may cause the dressing to
leak, thereby defeating the aim of sterility. However,
existing methods of aspiration can lead to wound infection or
can destroy sterility. Additionally, it is not desirable to
remove all the exudate as that would result in a "dry" wound
resulting in a slower healing process.There is a substantial body of prior art relating to
wound and/or surgical dressings or packings for treating skin
lesions, such as decubitus ulcers and open wounds. In some
instances, the wound dressing or packing may be designed to
be only temporary, such as the use of gauze to absorb blood
and/or other wound exudate. In others, the wound dressing is
designed to be more permanent in nature, remaining in place
for several hours or days during the healing process. In yet 
other instances, the wound dressing material is designed to
be biodegradable and to break down over an extended period of
time as a wound heals.Aqueous moisture absorbing materials, such as a hydrogel
material with a polyethylene glycol liquid curing agent, as
disclosed in Spence, U.S. Patent No. 4,226,232, have been
used as dressings on a wound site, but cannot be sterilized
by irradiation due to the formation of free radicals within
the aqueous material. Another aqueous absorbing material
used to absorb wound exudate is a hydrophilic polymer as
disclosed in Rawlings et al, U.S. Patent No. 4,657,006.

<CLAIMS>
A wound packing comprising:

a sterile wound packing material (10) including a
flexible, substantially flat absorbent layer (12) capable

of absorbing wound exudate; and
a package (20) for said wound packing material (10), said
package (20) comprising sealed first and second sheets

(22, 24) with said wound packing material (10)
therebetween, 
characterized in
 that said absorbent layer
(12) is in the form of a coiled spirally-cut layer.
A sterile wound packing as recited in claim 1 wherein
said absorbent layer (12) is impregnated with a partially

dehydrated hydrogel (14) containing from about 5 to about
55 % by weight water.
A sterile wound packing as recited in claim 1 wherein
said absorbent layer (12) is impregnated with a

substantially dehydrated hydrogel (14) containing less
than 5 % by weight water.
A sterile wound packing as recited in claims 1 or 2
wherein said absorbent layer (12) includes interstices,

and said partially dehydrated hydrogel material (14) is
completely impregnated in said interstices such that said 

hydrogel material (14) is substantially exposed at the
outer surface of said absorbent layer (12).
A sterile wound packing as recited in claims 1 or 2
wherein said partially dehydrated hydrogel material (14)

contains from about 40 % to about 45 % by weight water.
A sterile wound packing as recited in claim 1 in which
said absorbent layer (12) is selected from the group

consisting of woven gauze, fabric, nonwoven natural or
synthetic fibers, polymeric sheets and films.
A sterile wound packing as recited in claim 1 wherein
said package (20) includes a backing layer (28) having a

release coating on its surface which is adhered to a
portion of the inner surface of one of said first and

second sheets, and wherein said wound packing material
(10) is positioned on said backing layer (28) such that

it contacts said release coating.
A sterile wound packing as recited in claim 1 in which
said package (20) includes an opening (27) in one of said

first and second sheets (22, 24) located adjacent one end
of said wound packing material (10) for providing access

to said wound packing material (10), and removable means
(30) for sealing said opening. 
A sterile wound packing as recited in claim 1 in which
said first and second sheets (22, 24) of said package

(20) are made of metal foil, metal-coated polymer,
polymer, paper, or coated paper.
