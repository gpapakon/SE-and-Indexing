<ABSTRACT>
A dimensionally stable, UV hardenable polymeric composition is provided in which a 
conductive filler material is combined with a solventless resin formulation comprising a low 

viscosity epoxide compound, a photo initiator, and a thermal cure initiator. The properties of the 
polymeric composition may be adjusted through the addition of reactive diluents, poly alcohol 

flexiblizers, and acrylate based polymers, photo initiators, and thermal cure initiators. 
Conductive traces produced by extruding the polymeric composition through a syringe are 

subjected to a preliminary UV hardening step followed by deposition of an insulator layer and 
additional conductive traces, until all layers of conductive traces have been deposited. The 

structure is then subjected to heat until the conductive traces are fully cured. The formulation 
and the process described produce traces with bulk conductivity at least two times higher than 

any comparable conductive polymer, without using solvents. This process is purely additive, 
non-polluting and does not produce waste.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to conductive polymeric compositions, and more particularly to 
solventless, ultraviolet (UV) hardenable polymeric compositions for producing conductive traces 
on circuit boards. The conductive elements that connect electronic components on a circuit board and 
couple signals around a circuit board may be produced by "writing" conductive traces on the 
board material with a conductive polymeric composition. Typically, the polymeric material 
comprises a conductive filler which is dispersed in a resin formulation that includes solvents to 
reduce viscosity. The resulting conductive polymeric material is extruded in its uncured state 
through a syringe-like apparatus which is translated over the circuit board to deposit conductive 
traces in the desired circuit pattern or screen printed through a pattern created by a stencil. For 
certain known conductive polymeric materials, traces formed of such materials are periodically 
cured by heating the material to evaporate the solvents. Ideally, conductive polymeric compositions are cured quickly and thoroughly so that 
insulator layers and additional conductive traces can be added directly over the cured conductive 
traces without causing short circuits. In addition, the conductive traces must maintain good 
electrical contact with the metal pads to which electrical components and leads are connected. 
The material should also maintain its conductive properties through the curing process. This is 
particularly important where the conductive traces form arcuate sections, such as curves and  
 
'hops' over previously deposited traces. The arcuate geometry creates uneven stresses in the 
conductive traces which may he exacerbated by curing. Further, it is often necessary to deposit 
the conductive material in vias, which are narrow diameter passages through the circuit board for 
connecting circuitry on opposite sides of the board Suitable materials must be readily cured 
despite the limited exposed surface area available for solvent evaporation in vias. To achieve the desired conductivity while maintaining the low viscosities necessary for 
extruding circuit traces, conventional conductive polymeric materials contain solvents. Solvents 
reduce the viscosity of conventional conductive polymeric materials and increase the 
concentration of conductive filler material when they evaporate following deposition. The solvent content of conventional conductive polymeric materials limits their 
effectiveness for writing circuits in the manner
