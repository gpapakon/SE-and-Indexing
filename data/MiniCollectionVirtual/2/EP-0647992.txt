<ABSTRACT>
The terminal strip for connecting conductor wires of the same polarity is characterised in that it comprises, on the one hand, an elongate cradle (1) having a longitudinal post (leg) (6), a base-piece (5) and a series of slots (2) which are made in the said post and are open opposite the said base-piece and, on the other hand, a clamping clip (3) mounted so as to pivot on one of the ends of the cradle and covering the cradle and the wires positioned in the said slots. Application: earth-continuity terminal strip.

A terminal strip for connecting conductor wires
of the same polarity including on the one hand an

elongate cradle (1, 41, 61) having a longitudinal jamb
(6, 46, 66), a mounting flange (5, 45, 65A, 65B) and a

series of slots (2, 42, 62), said slots extending along
said jamb, being open at the end opposite said mounting

flange and being assigned to positioning respective
individual conductor wires (25), and on the other hand a

longitudinal clamp (3, 43, 63) articulated to one end of
said jamb about a retaining finger (15, 55, 75) passing

through said jamb and adapted to cap said jamb and said
conductor wires positioned in said slots in a closed

position, wherein said cradle and/or said clamp is
metallic and is adapted to be at said polarity.
A terminal strip according to claim 1
characterised in that said cradle (1, 41) has an L-shape

cross-section defining said jamb (6, 46) and said
mounting flange (5, 45).
A terminal strip according to claim 2
characterised in that said jamb (6) has a solid and

substantially rectangular cross-section with a top face
opposite the mounting flange and two longitudinal faces

and said slots (2) extend substantially halfway across
said top face and one of said longitudinal faces on each

side of the edge between them but do not extend onto the
other of said longitudinal faces.
A terminal strip according to claim 3

characterised in that the longitudinal face of said jamb
into which said slots (2) extend is opposite said

mounting flange (5).
A terminal strip according to claim 3 or
claim 4 characterised in that said cradle (1) further

includes a series of holes (20) substantially aligned in
the median longitudinal plane of said jamb (6), opening 

onto said top face at the corresponding end of the
individual slots and closed at the opposite end.
A terminal strip according to any one of claims
3 to 5 characterised in that said slots (2, 42) have an

internal chamfer (12, 52) at the end along their facing
edges.
A terminal strip according to claim 2
characterised in that said slots (42) pass through said

jamb (45), open onto a top longitudinal edge of said jamb
and are closed at the opposite end.
A terminal strip according to claim 1
characterised in that said cradle (61) has an inverted

U-shape cross-section with a rounded base and two
branches together constituting said jamb and in that said

slots are formed through the base of the cradle and
extend to each side substantially halfway up the branches

of the U.
A terminal strip according to claim 7 or
claim 8 characterised in that said slots (62) are in

parallel planes oblique to the cross-section plane of the
cradle (61).
A terminal strip according to any one of
claims 1 to 9 characterised in that said clamp (3, 43,

63) has a substantially inverted U-shape cross-section
having a base and two re-entrant elastic longitudinal

branches (13, 53, 73) with opposite longitudinal edges
(13A, 53A, 73A) bent outwards.
A terminal strip according to claim 10
characterised in that said clamp (13, 43, 63) includes at

least one holding flap (16, 66, 76) projecting from the
end portion of the base of the clamp opposite said

retaining finger providing the articulation to said
cradle.
A terminal strip according to claim 10 or
claim 11 characterised in that the branches of the 

clamp (43, 63) have notches facing each other and facing
gaps between the slots or the successive sets of slots

(2, 42, 62).
A terminal strip according to any one of
claims 1 to 12 characterised in that said cradle and said

clamp are both metallic.
A terminal strip according to any one of
claims 1 to 12 characterised in that said cradle (1) is

made of a plastics material and said clamp (3) is
metallic and in that it further includes a metallic

tongue (4) for applying said polarity to said conductor
wires (25) having a first end portion (17, 18) fixed to

said cradle and capped by said clamp (3) in the position
closed onto the cradle and said conductor wires in said

slots.
A terminal strip according to claim 14
characterised in that it further includes fixing lugs

(7, 47, 67) projecting from said cradle and in the plane
of said mounting flange (5, 45, 65) and in that said

tongue (4) is fixed to said cradle by its first end
portion (17, 18) which on the one hand is received into

one of the fixing lugs (7) which is grooved for this
purpose and on the other hand is partially embedded in

said jamb (6) which is also grooved for this purpose.
