<ABSTRACT>
A stanchion (2) is described for supporting the end of a rail (3) on the roof of a motor vehicle, which stanchion (2) has a fastening means to enable it to be fastened to the vehicle roof, a supporting surface (9) which rests on the roof, and an inserting pin (10), which is at a vertical and lateral distance from the supporting surface (9), for establishing a plug-in connection to the rail (3), at least one passage (11) passing through it transversely and a lining plate (7) which covers the at least one passage (11) at both ends. Provision is made according to the invention for this stanchion to be composed of an extruded profile strip section which is separated transversely to the longitudinal axis.
