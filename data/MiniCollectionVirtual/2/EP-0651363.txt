<ABSTRACT>
A fire alarm system having terminal units (S) in a 
supervisory system for supervising a fire phenomenon, a 

receiving portion (RE) and terminal units (B,ER,AN) 
in a control system to be 

controlled by the receiving portion that is able to reduce a 
required space in a case of a small size system. The terminal 

units in the supervisory system are given individual addresses, 
the terminal units in the supervisory system and the receiving 

portion communicate with each other through the addresses, and 
the terminal units in the control system are connected to the 

receiving portion through individual signal lines (L2,L3,L4).
