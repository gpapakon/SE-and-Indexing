<ABSTRACT>
A combustor for a gas turbine having primary and 
secondary combustion zones. The combustor has a centrally 

disposed dual fuel nozzle (18) that can supply a fuel rich 
mixture of either liquid and gaseous fuel to the primary 

combustion zone. The combustor also has primary gas fuel 
spray bars (62) for supplying a lean mixture of gaseous fuel (16'') to 

the primary combustion zone (36) via a first annular pre-mixing 
passage (90,92) and secondary gas fuel spray bars (76) for supplying a 

lean mixture of gaseous fuel (16''') to the secondary combustion 
zone (37) via a second annular pre-mixing passage (68). In addition, 

the combustor also has a plurality of liquid fuel spray 
nozzles (84) for introducing a lean mixture of liquid fuel (14'') into 

the secondary combustion zone (37) via the second annular pre-mixing 
passage (68). The liquid fuel spray nozzles (84) are disposed 

in fan shaped channels (96) that are arranged in a 
circumferential array and that are connected to the second 

annular pre-mixing passage (68). The fan shaped channels (96) cause 
expansion of the spray of fuel from the liquid spray 

nozzles (84) and serve to ensure good atomization of the liquid 
fuel (14'') prior to its introduction into the second annular pre-mixing 

passage (68).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a gas turbine
combustor for burning both liquid and gaseous fuel in
compressed air. More specifically, the present invention
relates to a low NOx combustor having the capability of
burning lean mixtures of both liquid and gaseous fuel.In a gas turbine, fuel is burned in compressed
air, produced by a compressor, in one or more combustors.
Traditionally, such combustors had a primary combustion
zone in which an approximately stoichiometric mixture of
fuel and air was formed and burned in a diffusion type
combustion process. Fuel was introduced into the primary
combustion zone by means of a centrally disposed fuel
nozzle. When operating on liquid fuel, such nozzles were
capable of spraying fuel into the combustion air so that
the fuel was atomized before it entered the primary combustion
zone. Additional air was introduced into the combustor
downstream of the primary combustion zone so that the
overall fuel/air ratio was considerably less than stoichiometric
-- i.e., lean. Nevertheless, despite the use of
lean fuel/air ratios, the fuel/air mixture was readily
ignited at start-up and good flame stability was achieved
over a wide range of firing temperatures due to the locally
richer nature of the fuel/air mixture in the primary
combustion zone.Unfortunately, use of rich fuel/air mixtures in
the primary combustion zone resulted in very high temperatures.
Such high temperatures promoted the formation of 
oxides of nitrogen ("NOx"), considered an atmospheric
pollutant. It is known that combustion at lean fuel/air
ratios reduces NOx formation. However, achieving such lean
mixtures requires that the fuel be widely distributed and
very well mixed into the combustion air. This can be
accomplished by pre-mixing the fuel into the combustion air
prior to its introduction into the combustion zone.In the case of gaseous fuel, this pre-mixing can be
accomplished by introducing the fuel into primary and
secondary annular passages that pre-mix the fuel and air
and then direct the pre-mixed fuel into primary and secondary
combustion zones, respectively. The gaseous fuel is
introduced into these primary and secondary pre-mixing
passages using fuel spray tubes distributed around the
circumference of each passage. A combuscor of this type is
disclosed in "Industrial RB211 Dry Low Emission Combustion"
by J. Willis et al., American Society of Mechanical Engineers
(May 1993).Unfortunately, such combustors are capable of operation
on only gaseous fuel because the fuel spray tubes are
not adapted
