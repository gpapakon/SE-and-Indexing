<ABSTRACT>
A modular drainmast assembly for an aircraft includes a 
drain tube assembly (304) removable enclosed in a fairing 

(302) that is removably attachable to an aircraft. The 
electrically heated drain tube assembly (304) may be 

accessed in the field for service, repair or replacement. A 
resilient sealed interface (309) supports the drain tube 

where it exits the drainmast while permitting relative 
movement between the drain tube and the drainmast fairing 

(302) due to thermal expansion and contraction.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention pertains to a drain apparatus,
particularly a drainmast for aircraft, and particularly to
a modular drainmast including a drain tube removably
enclosed in a fairing that is removably attachable to an
aircraft.A drainmast is used to eject waste water from an
aircraft waste system during flight without impingement of
the ejected fluid further aft on the body of the aircraft,
and to drain the waste system when on the ground.As used herein the term "waste water" means
undesired water-based liquids that accumulate during
operation of an aircraft on the ground and in flight.
Waste water is generated by many sources, one common source
being the aircraft galley in which water, soft drinks,
coffee, wine, orange juice and other potable liquids are
collected. Waste water can also accumulate from engine and
other air inlets that trap water from condensation or
ingest rain.A drainmast generally comprises a drain tube
enclosed within an aerodynamically shaped, drag
minimizing fairing that when installed protrudes
downwardly from the underside of an aircraft such that 
its outlet extends into the surrounding airflow stream
during flight. It may be swept aftwardly of the aircraft
with the direction of airflow. The drain tube is coupled
to the aircraft waste water storage tank and is heated to
avoid freezing. In certain applications waste water is
accumulated until it reaches a certain volume. Thereupon a
valve inside the aircraft opens and the waste water drains
from the tank through the drainmast. In other
applications, the waste water is continuously drained.There are two prevalent configurations for
drainmasts. One is herein referred to as a bottom discharge
mast. The other configuration is herein referred to as a
rear discharge mast.In a bottom discharge drainmast, the waste water
is ejected generally perpendicularly to surrounding
airflow. The mast is generally straight and swept. The
axis of the drain tube at the exit forms an acute angle
with the axis at the entrance. The angle is usually close
to the angle of sweep of the mast.In a rear discharge drainmast, the mast is swept
and wing shaped and tapers into an exit tube at the tip
that is roughly parallel to surrounding airflow. Water is
ejected parallel to the surrounding airflow from the rear
of the mast. Since the axis of the drain tube at the exit
is nearly perpendicular to the axis at the entrance, the
drain tube is either bent in a smooth curve or is
fabricated from two or more straight sections that together
form the appropriate angle.The

<CLAIMS>
A drainmast for discharging fluid into a surrounding
airflow comprising:


a fairing (302) having first and second opposing ends,
a drain tube assembly (304) disposed within said
fairing (302) and exiting said fairing (302) at said

first and second ends, said drain tube assembly (304)
including an electrothermal heating element (330),
a drain tube attachment (332) that attaches said drain
tube assembly (304) to said fairing (302), allowing at

least one end of the drain tube to move relative to
the fairing, freely expanding and contracting without

resistance, and
a first resilient sealed interface between said drain
tube assembly (304) and said first end,
characterized in

that said fairing (302) comprises a fairing body
(302') having an opening and a cover plate (302'') covering said

opening, said fairing (302) enclosing
attachment means (326) providing openings for resiliently
guiding said drain tube assembly (304) within

said fairing (302).
The drainmast of claim 1 wherein the distance between
the fairing body (302') and the cover plate (302'') is

fixed by the attachment means (326) disposed within
said fairing (302).
The drainmast of claim 1 or 2 wherein a resilient
layer (334) is located within the opening of said

attachment means (326) surrounding the drain tube
assembly (304). 
The drainmast of one of claims 1-3 wherein the attachment
means (326) are comprised of an upper and a lower

half, the upper half being integral with the fairing
body (302') and the lower half being integral with the

cover plate (302'').
The drainmast of claim 4 wherein the upper and the
lower half of the attachment means are maintained in

relative abutment by screws (324) extending from outer
surface of the fairing into the opposing spacer half.
The drainmast of one of claims 1-5 wherein the drain
tube assembly (304) comprises a foot (308)

with a foot ring (344), the foot ring (344)
surrounding the end portion of the outer circumference

of the fairing (302), with a resilient sealed
interface (309) disposed between the fairing

(302) and the foot ring (344).
The drainmast of claim 6 wherein the end portion of
the fairing (302) is recessed so that the outer

surface of the fairing (302) is flush with the
outer surface of the foot ring (344).
The drainmast of one of claims 1-7 further comprising
a second resilient sealed interface between said drain

tube assembly (304) and said second end, the drain
tube assembly (304) and the fairing (302)

being sealed at both ends of the fairing (302).
The drainmast of one of claims 1-8 wherein said first
resilient sealed interface (309) is a hardened

liquid sealant.
The drainmast of claim 9 wherein said hardened liquid
sealant is chosen from the group consisting of

polysulfide sealant and room temperature vulcanizing
silicone elastomer sealant. 
The drainmast of one of claims 1-8 wherein said first
resilient sealed interface (309) is an elastomeric

fitting.
The drainmast of one of claims 1-11 wherein said drain
tube attachment resiliently attaches said drain tube

assembly (304) to said fairing (302).
The drainmast of one of claims 1-12 wherein said drain
tube assembly (304) includes a foot (308)

exposed to the surrounding airflow, said foot
(308;208) including an electrothermal heating element.
