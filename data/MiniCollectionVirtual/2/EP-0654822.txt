<ABSTRACT>
Heat sink assembly for naked integrated circuit (19) mounted on a printed 
circuit board (21) comprising a torsion bar (1) ended in two arms (7,8) 

perpendicular to the bar and parallel each to the other, the arms having a 
free end bent to form a hooking element (9,10) a heat sink centering and 

preloading frame for centering a heat sink and preloading the torsion bar, 
the frame having a first surface for resting on a printed circuit board and 

a second surface opposite to the first, the torsion bar overlaying the second 
surface with the hooking elements (9,10) hooked in recesses (18) formed in 

the frame (2) close to the first surface, so as to torsionally preload the 
bar, a heat sink (3) formed from a radiating plate housed in the frame (2) 

and means (4,5) for clamping the frame (2) to a printed circuit board (21) 
in centered position as to a die (19) to be cooled, the torsion bar (1) urging 

the heat sink on the die (19) with a predetermined force assuring a uniform 
contact pressure distribution independently of the die mounting incidence 

on the printed circuit board (21).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a heat sink assembly for naked 
integrated circuit. A crucial problem in the use of integrated circuits is the 
dissipation of the heat developed by such circuits during operation. To this purpose finned dissipating elements, known as heat sinks, 
having high thermal conductivity are used, which are tightly coupled to 
the integrated circuit package or are integral with the package. The thermal transfer efficiency of these heat sinks is limited by 
the thermal drop occurring in the insulating material, generally epoxy 
resin or like, which separates the integrated circuit chip or die from its 
container, hence from the radiating element or heat sink. To overcome this limitation packages have been devised where the 
integrated circuit substrate is soldered to the heat dissipator. This arrangement, used in solid state power circuits, cannot be 
used with large scale integrated circuits having a remarkable number of 
input/output pins which must be fixed to a printed circuit board or more 
generally to an intermediate ceramic or plastic support with batch 
processes, by means of equipment inconsistent with the presence of a 
heat sink steady with the die. Moreover, the presence of a heat sink integral with the die and 
necessarily having a size much greater than the one of the integrated 
circuit, even in extension along the plane of the printed circuit board 
supporting the electronic components precludes the access to a broad 
surface of the printed circuit board, which preferably should be free 
from encumbrances to allows at least for access to test pads, if not for 
the installation of electronic components. These limitations are overcome by the heat sink assembly which is 
the object of the present invention allowing for the use of naked dies, 
mounted on printed circuit boards by known techniques, and providing 
a direct contact of the die with a dissipating element, removably fixed to 
the printed circuit board. The technical problem which must be solved in adapting this 
approach is the one to assure an adequate contact pressure between the 
die and the heat sink. The pressure must be gradually applied and must  
 
be uniformly distributed on the die surface and local stresses must be 
avoided which could damage the semiconductor die (and its connections) 
particularly brittle and fragile. At the same time a distribute contact must be assured adaptive to 
possible errors in parallelism between the die surface and the plane of 
the printed circuit board to which the
