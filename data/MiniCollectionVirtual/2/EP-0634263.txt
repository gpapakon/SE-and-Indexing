<ABSTRACT>
A method of making by extrusion-molding an elongated 
window frame used for a window panel of a vehicle is to 

use an extrusion molding die (A) which includes a slide core (7,8) 
defining the cross-sectional shape of the window frame (11), 

and to move the slide core (7,8) in the extrusion-molding die (A) 
so that the cross-sectional shape of the window frame (11) is 

continuously changed along the direction of the length.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method of making a
window frame used suitably for a window panel for
vehicles or buildings, and a method of making a window
panel with a window frame.There is a case that a window frame for a front glass
of a vehicle is provided with a rain gutter at its side
portion to provide a flow passage for rain. The rain
gutter is to prevent the eyesight of a driver from
decreasing by the deposition of rain drops scattering
from the sides of the front glass onto the side windows.
However, it is unnecessary to form the rain gutter in the
upper side portion of the window frame.In a conventional technique, window frames having
different shapes in cross section were separately
prepared for the upper peripheral portion and side
peripheral portions of the front glass, and the window
frames were joined interposing a joint in one piece at a 
portion corresponding to a corner of the front glass by
using a compression or an injection molding method.
Therefore, the position of the joined portions was
conspicuous. Further, the color tone and the gloss of
the window frame were ununiform because the parts of the
window frame were separately prepared. In addition, the
joined portions may be broken, or noises may be produced
due to the vibrations of the vehicle during driving.In order to eliminate the above-mentioned problems, a
method of making a window frame of a one-piece body
without a joined portion was proposed in USP 5,167,893
and USP 5,174,623. According to the proposal, a shutter
is provided in front of an extrusion-molding die to open
and close slowly an opening portion of the die so that a
rain gutter is gradually formed in and disappears from
window frame. However, in such method, the cross-sectional
shape of the window frame is changed by closing
a part of the opening of the die. At the opening of the
die, a resistance takes place in resin in a portion
contacting to the shutter, and no resistance takes place
in the resin at a portion without contacting to the
shutter. Then there is a difference of speed in the
resin to be extruded depending on the presence or the
absence of the resistance, whereby a shaped product is
bent to the side of the shutter, and a stable shaping is
difficult to obtain. Further, when a high viscous
material is used, shaping of the window frame is 
difficult because the shape of the window frame is
changed at the outlet of the die.It is an object of the present invention to eliminate
problems of the appearance and the strength of a window
frame, due to the

<CLAIMS>
A method of making by extrusion-molding an elongated window frame (1) for a
window panel (2), by extruding resin through an extrusion-molding die characterized

in that the extrusion molding die comprises a main body (6) and at least one slide
core (7; 8; 15; 16; 17; 22; 23; 25) received in the main body (6), whereby a shaping

space in the die is formed by the main body and the at least one slide core and by
moving the at least one slide core in the extrusion-molding die during extrusion so

that the cross-sectional shape of the window frame is continuously changed, while
the outlet opening surface of the molding die remains essentially flat so that the

cross-sectional shape of the shaping space substantially corresponds to the cross-sectional
shape of the window frame.
The method according to Claim 1, wherein a rate of extrusion of resin is changed
depending on a change of the cross-sectional shape of the window frame.
The method according to Claim 1, wherein a driving source for moving the slide
core is an electric motor (9; 10; 13; 14; 20; 24) a fluid pressure or a spring (18; 21).
The method according to Claim 1, wherein the extrusion-molding die is adapted
to extrude two or more different kinds of material at the same time while the shape

in cross section of the window frame is changed.
A method according to one of Claims 1 or 2, whereby the resin is extruded onto
at least one surface of a window panel along the peripheral portion of the window

panel, and cured to thereby connect the window panel with the cured shaped
product in one piece, whereby a thermoplastic resin is used and extruded in a

softened state by heating it and subsequently cured. 
The method according to Claim 5, wherein the viscosity of the resin when the
resin is extruded from the die in a softened state is in a range of 1000 poises -

500,000 poises under the condition of a shear rate of 1/10 sec.
The method according to Claim 5, wherein the thermoplastic resin is a soft
polyvinyl chloride resin, an olefin resin or a styrene resin.
