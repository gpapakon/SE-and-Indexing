<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a film for a first-aid
sticking plaster, and more particularly, it relates to a film for
a first-aid sticking plaster which can obtain a flexible first-aid
sticking plaster having excellent feeling, with a low
possibility of compressing the affected part.In general, a sticking plaster, particularly a first-aid
sticking plaster is prepared through the following steps:
First, a soft film is prepared so that its surface is coated with
an adhesive, and a gauze or the like is attached onto the
adhesive. Further, a separator is disposed on a gauze to obtain
a layered product. Then, the layered product is punched into
prescribed dimensions, and packing papers are superposed on
front and back surfaces of the punched layered product and cut
into prescribed dimensions, to obtain a first-aid sticking
plaster.The soft film employed for the aforementioned first-aid
sticking plaster is generally made of a material which is mainly
composed of plasticized polyvinyl chloride (hereinafter referred
to as plasticised PVC) prepared by calendering or sol casting, in
consideration of flexibility, stretchability and feeling. However, a plasticised PVC film contains a plasticizer in a
large amount. Thus, the plasticiser may be transferred from the
film toward the adhesive to reduce its adhesion or adhesive
strength between the film and the adhesive, leading to
separation of the sticking plaster. Further, problems in
employment of plasticized PVC, which is a polymer containing
chlorine, are recently discussed in all fields in consideration
of environment.To this end, positive development is now being made on
polyolefin resin having flexibility and high stretchability, as
a material for taking place of the plasticised PVC.A film of such polyolefin resin is prepared from
polyethylene, an ethylene-vinyl acetate copolymer,
polybutadiene or an ethylene-propylene copolymer, for example.
Japanese Patent Publication No. 57-11342 (1982) discloses a film
for a first-aid sticking plaster which is prepared by drawing a
polyolefin composition consisting of at least one of an
ethylene-α-olefin copolymer, LDPE (low density polyethylene) and
PP (polypropylene) by 1.5 to 3.5 times, while Japanese Patent
Laying-Open No. 62-82967 (1987) discloses a film consisting of a
hydrocarbon elastomer such as ethylene-propylene rubber or an
ethylene-propylene-diene ternary copolymer and a polyolefin
compound such as an ethylene-vinyl acetate copolymer.However, such a film of polyolefin resin is insufficient in
stretchability
