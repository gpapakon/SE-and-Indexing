<ABSTRACT>
The device (1) comprises a membrane (15) supported by a tubular body (13) made of elastomer, which is elastically connected to a support body (16) of a first connector (8). The body (16) has a sleeve (17) provided with a screw thread (18) and a tubular part (19) for fastening to a liquid bag intended for medical use. The device comprises, in addition, a perforator (56) supported by a second connector (10) which is fixed to a pipe. The perforator (56) is provided with a tip (57) and with two openings (61) and is solidly attached to a sleeve (52) having a screw thread (53) which is complementary to that of the sleeve (17) of the first connector (8). Normally, each connector (8, 10) is closed by a plug which guarantees its sterility. At the time of use, the two plugs are removed and the two sleeves (17, 52) are screwed together in order to perforate the membrane (15) using the tip (57) of the perforator (56).
