<ABSTRACT>
The invention concerns a device intended for use with an air-blowing appliance for personal use, in particular a hair-dryer or a hot-air curler. The device has a main body (10) and a flat air-output element (12) with several air-outlet apertures and with several hair-styling elements (16) disposed in close vicinity to each other. The remote ends (18) of the hair-styling elements (16) form an essentially concave envelope.

An implement for styling and/or drying hair for
an air-moving appliance for personal use, in particular a

hair dryer or a hot-air curling brush, comprising a body
(10) and a unifacial air discharge means (12) which includes

a series of air exit apertures (14) and carries a
series of hair pickup elements (16) arranged adjacent to

each other and distributed substantially over the surface
of said air discharge means (12), wherein the hair pickup

elements (16) are of rod-shaped configuration, wherein
the ratio of the length of the rod-shaped hair pickup

elements (16) to a mean diameter thereof is greater than
5 to 1, wherein the downstream ends (18) of the hair

pickup elements (16) lie on a substantially concave surface
and the hair pickup elements (16) are designed such

that-a major number of the downstream ends (18) of the
hair pickup elements (16) contact, when in use, the

user's scalp and, as a result of a movement of the hair
pickup elements (16) on the user's scalp, the hairs are

caught, pushed up between the hair pickup elements (16)
and lifted up in the direction of the air discharge means

(12), thereby obtaining body and volume in the user's
hair.
An implement as claimed in claim 1, characterised in that those hair
pickup elements (16) that are arranged in an outer region (40) in particular an

edge segment of the air discharge means (12), are of greater length than the hair
pickup elements (16) that are arranged in an inner region (42) of the air discharge

means (12).
An implement as claimed in any one of the preceding claims, characterised
in that the ratio is approximately between 8 to 1 and 14 to 1. 
An implement as claimed in any one of the preceding claims, characterised
in that the air discharge means (12) is arched outwardly towards the downstream

ends (18).
An implement as claimed in any one of the preceding claims, characterised
in that the hair pickup elements (16) are arranged on concentric circular rings (30,

31, 32, 33) in particular spaced from one another at approximately equal
distances.
An implement as claimed in any one of the preceding claims, characterised
in that the hair pickup elements (16) are arranged on the air discharge means (12)

in the form of two quadrangles (34) disposed in a 90Â° offset in relation to each
other, their sides being curved in a concave fashion relative to a centre of the air

discharge means (12).
An implement as claimed in claim 6, characterised in that the concave
sides of the quadrangles (34) correspond approximately to the arcs of a circle.
An implement as claimed in any one of the preceding claims, characterised
in that the air discharge means (12) is formed by circular rib members (20)

disposed in offset relation to each other in two planes.
An implement as claimed in claim 8, characterised in that the rib members
(20) are at least in part configured as annular walls (22) of different heights.
An implement as claimed in claim 9, characterised in that downstream end
portions (24) of the annular walls (22) lie on a convex surface.
An implement as claimed in any one of the claims 8 to 10, characterised
in that the hair pickup elements (16) are fixedly secured to the rib members (20).
An implement as claimed in any one of the preceding claims, characterised
in that the hair pickup elements (16) are arranged substantially parallel to each

other and in the direction of the main flow. 
An implement as claimed in any one of the preceding claims, characterised
in that the hair pickup elements (16) are of star-shaped cross section (25) with

rounded edges (26).
An implement as claimed in any one of the claims 1 to 12, characterised
in that the hair pickup elements (16) are of circular cross-section.
An implement as claimed in any one of the preceding claims, characterised
in that the downstream ends (18) of the hair pickup elements (16) are rounded off.
An implement as claimed in any one of the preceding claims, characterised
in that the air discharge means (12) has a circular base surface.
An implement as claimed in any one of the preceding claims, characterised
in that an imaginary plane extending through the ends (18) of the hair pickup

elements (16) is inclined with respect to the direction of the main flow.
A method for creating body and volume in the
user's hair using an implement for styling and/or drying

hair for an air-moving appliance for personal use, including
a series of hair pickup elements (16) arranged on

an air discharge means (12), characterized by the steps
of placing the downstream ends (18), which lie on a substantially

concave surface, of several hair pickup
elements (16) of the implement on the scalp and moving

the implement over the scalp, which involves catching the
hairs by the hair pickup elements (16), lifting the hairs

up between the hair pickup elements (16) in the direction
of the air discharge means (12), and drying the hairs in

this position, thereby providing the hair with body and
volume.
A method as claimed in claim 18, characterised by the use of an implement according
to any one of claims 1 to 17.
