<ABSTRACT>
A device for the administration of substance into the rumen of an animal comprises a body (2) having an open structure within which is retained at least one pellet (4) of the substance. The pellet (4) has an outer impervious coating which degrades when exposed to the action of ruminal fluid to permit subsequent release of the substance. Preferably, the device contains a group of such pellets (4) with the degradation times of the layers of the respective pellets being different whereby to permit release of substance from the group of pellets (4) in a timed sequence.

<DESCRIPTION>
 INTRA-RUMINAL DEVICESThe present invention relates to an intra-ruminal device for the delivery of a substance into the rumino-reticular sac of a ruminant animal.It is well known to administer nutrients and/or therapeutic materials to ruminant animals such as cattle and sheep by oral administration of the substance bolus into the rumino-reticular sac of the animal. Substances administered in this way include vitamins, food and mineral substances, anti-parasitic agents, parasiticides, larvicides, biocides, anti-infection agents, flukicides, and growth promotants. The substance may be introduced into the rumen by a device which carries the substance and which provides sustained release of the substance within the rumen. After delivery of the substance has been completed, the residue of the device is expelled. Conventional devices of this type u Â«sually provide continuous release of the substance over a substantial period of time commencing shortly after administration. However, a more efficient and effective treatment may be obtained if the substance is released in a more controlled pulsatile or periodic manner.According to the present invention there is provided a device for release of substance into the rumen of an animal, said device comprising a body carrying at least one pellet including substance to which access of ruminal fluids is initially prevented by an impermeable barrier which degrades when exposed to ruminal fluids, the body having an open structure to permit contact of ruminal fluids with the or each of the pellets, and said device being such that the device will remain within the rumen for a period of time sufficient to enable release of substance from the or each of the pellets.The device may be retained within the rumen for the required time by means of the density of the device. Alternatively, or in addition, retention of the device can be effected by means of the geometry or physical features of the device which may be such, when in the rumen, as to resist expulsion and for this 

purpose the device may have a geometry which changes, when in the rumen, to resist expulsion. By way of example this effect could be achieved by means of expandable wings on the device, and/or the device may carry external hairs, filaments, or other means which act to resist expulsion from the rumen for a period of time sufficient to ensure release of the substance.The substance may be released in a single pulse or dose and for this function only a single pellet will be required.

CLAIMS
1. A device for release of substance into the rumen of an animal, said device comprising a body carrying at least one pellet including substance to which access of ruminal fluids is initially prevented by an impermeable barrier which degrades when exposed to ruminal fluids, the body having an open structure to permit contact of ruminal fluids witii the or each of the pellets, and said device being such tiiat the device will remain within the rumen for a period of time sufficient to enable release of substance from the or each of the pellets.
2. A device according to claim 2, wherein the impermeable barrier of the or each pellet comprises a coating layer on d e pellet, the degradation rate of d e coating being dependent on the tiiickness and/or composition of the coating.
3. A device according to claim 2, wherein the impermeable barrier forms the outer surface of the pellet or of at least some of the pellets.
4. A device according to claim 1, wherein the pellet comprises several concentric layers consisting, alternately, of a layer of substance coated witii an impermeable barrier layer which degrades when exposed to ruminal fluids.
5. A device according to any one of claims 1 to 3, comprising a plurality of said pellets carried by die body such tiiat substantially simultaneous contact of ruminal fluids can occur with each of die pellets, the impermeable barrier of each respective pellet being such that d e time required to degrade die barrier differs from pellet to pellet.
6. A device according to claim 5, wherein the impermeable barriers of the respective pellets are such that release of substance from the respective pellets occurs at spaced intervals whereby release of substance from one pellet does not occur until a predetermined period of time after release of substance from another pellet has been completed. 


 7. A device according to any one of claims 1 to 6, in which die body is of a cage-like structure and includes means for locating the or each said pellet in a discrete position witiiin the structure.
8. A device according to any one of claims 1 to 7, wherein the device is such that retention witiiin the rumen for the required period of time is provided at least partially by the density of die device.
9. A device according to claim 8, wherein die device includes ballast which is released after a predetermined period of time to permit expulsion of remaining parts of the device from die rumen.
10. A device according to claim 9, wherein the device includes a housing within which the ballast is enclosed, die ballast comprises matter which is broken down on contact by ruminal fluids, and die housing is such tiiat contact of the ballast within the housing by ruminal fluids is prevented until the device has been within the rumen for a predetermined period of time.
11. A device according to claim 10, wherein the housing is at least partially defined by a material which degrades when exposed to ruminal fluids whereby access of ruminal fluids to die ballast occurs as a result of degradation of said material.
12. A device according to claim 10, wherein access of ruminal fluids to die ballast is via a passage which communicates with the open structure of the body, die passage initially being blocked by one said pellet and being opened by progressive dissolution of tiiat pellet.
13. A device according to claim 12 when dependent on claim 5, wherein the said one pellet is the pellet having an impermeable barrier which has the longest degradation time of the impermeable barriers of the group of pellets. 


14. A device according to any one of claims 10 to 13 when dependent on claim 7, wherein the housing and the cage-like structure are separate components secured together.
15. A device according to any one of claims 1 to 8, wherein retention of die device within the rumen for the required period of time is provided at least partially by die geometry of the device.
16. A device according to any one of claims 1 to 15, wherein die or each said pellet comprises a core containing the substance.
17. A device according to claim 16, wherein the surface of the core is coated to provide mechanical strength.
18. A device according to claim 17, wherein the impermeable barrier consists of a layer applied to the coated surface of the core.
19. A device according to any one of claims 16 to 18, wherein die or each said pellet is substantially spherical.
