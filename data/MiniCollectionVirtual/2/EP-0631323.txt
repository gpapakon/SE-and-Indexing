<ABSTRACT>
The present invention encompasses a complementary 
semiconductor device having the same type of material 

providing the ohmic contacts (117, 119) to both the N-type 
and P-type devices. In a preferred embodiment, P-source 

and P-drain regions (80, 82) are heavily doped 
with a P-type impurity (81, 83) so that an ohmic with N-type 

impurity can be used as an ohmic contact. One ohmic 
material that may be used is nickel-germanium-tungsten. 

Nickel-germanium-tungsten is etchable, and therefore does 
not require lift-off pro
cessing. Furthermore, a 
preferred complementary semiconductor device made in 

accordance with the present invention is compatible with 
modern aluminum based VLSI interconnection processes.

<DESCRIPTION>
This application is related to co-pending patent 
application "METHOD OF MAKING OHMIC CONTACTS TO A 
COMPLEMENTARY SEMICONDUCTOR DEVICE", Attorney Docket No. 
CR08317, filed by Jonathan K. Abrokwah et al. 
concurrently with the present application. The present invention relates, in general, to 
semiconductor devices, and more particularly, to 
complementary semiconductor devices. Complementary semiconductor devices, and 
specifically III-V complementary heterostructure field 
effect transistors (CHFETs) or complementary 
heterostructure insulated gate field effect transistors 
(CHIGFETs) have been shown to be extremely useful for low 
power, low voltage and high speed applications. See, for 
example, "Low Power AlGaAs/GaAs Complementary FETs 
Incorporating InGaAs N-channel Gates," Abrokwah, U.S. 
Patent No. 4,729,000 and "High Transconductance 
Complementary (Al, Ga) As/GaAs Heterostructure Insulated 
Gate Field-Effect Transistors," Abrokwah et al, U.S. 
Patent No. 4,814,851. The prior art discloses 
complementary gallium arsenide (GaAs) heterostructure 
devices using self-aligned ion implantation technology. 
CHIGFETs are CMOS-like devices using a wide bandgap 
insulator, such as aluminum gallium arsenide (AlGaAs) or 
aluminum indium arsenide (AlInAs) to confine high 
mobility two-dimensional electron or hole gases, in the 
channel, for carrier transport. The two-dimensional  
 
gases are formed close to the heterojunction of the wide 
bandgap material insulator and the narrow bandgap 
material channel. A typical channel material is 
pseudomorphic InxGa1-xAs. The prior art, however, 
exhibits several drawbacks with respect to the ohmic 
contact metallization employed for electrically 
contacting the active regions of the devices. The complementary nature of the devices of course 
implies that they include both N-type and P-type devices 
on the same substrate. The typical ohmic metallization 
of the prior art is different for N-type and P-type 
devices. For N-type, gold germanium nickel (AuGeNi) has 
been used. For P-type, gold zinc nickel (AuZnNi) or gold 
zinc gold (AuZnAu) has been used. Both ohmic contacts 
rely on Au metallization for low resistance, resulting in 
several disadvantages. The Au-based ohmics are not 
etchable. Consequently, they must be defined on the 
device by a lift-off process. As is well understood in 
the art, lift-off is associated with relatively poor 
yields and poor pattern definition, and thus limits 
device geometries to relatively large dimensions. The 
large dimensions
