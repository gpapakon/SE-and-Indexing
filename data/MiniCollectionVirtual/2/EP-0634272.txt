<ABSTRACT>
Described are an inkjet recording apparatus and a method of 
controlling it. The apparatus comprises an inkjet head (10) 

having for each of one or more nozzles (4), an ink passage in 
communication with the nozzle, and an electrostatic actuator 

comprising a pair of capacitor plates of which one plate is 
formed by or attached to a diaphragm provided in a part of 

said ink passage, while the other plate is formed by an electrode 
disposed outside of said ink passage in opposition to 

the diaphragm with a gap therebetween, and drive means (210, 
212, 213; 210) for selectively charging and discharging each 

actuator such as to displace its diaphragm by an electrostatic 
force, thereby to eject ink droplets from said one or 

more nozzles. To avoid an adverse effect of a residual charge 
remaining on the actuator after it has been discharged, in 

one embodiment a first voltage is applied to charge an actuator 
and a second to reset an actuator. The second voltage is 

of a polarity opposite to that of the first voltage such as 
to remove the residual charge. In an alternative embodiment 

the actuator is preset by applying a second voltage of a 
magnitude equal to or greater than the maximum magnitude of 

the first voltage to be expected. Both measures ensure a 
stable actuator operation resulting in a good recording 

quality.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an inkjet recording apparatus
having a so-called ink-on-demand type inkjet head which
ejects ink droplets only when respective dots are actually to
be recorded on a recording medium. More specifically, the
invention relates to an inkjet recording apparatus having an
electrostatically driven inkjet head and to a method of
driving it.Mainly two kinds of ink-on-demand type inkjet heads are
currently used differing in the way of generating the pressure
required for ink ejection. One kind uses piezoelectric
actuators for this purpose as disclosed in, e.g., DE-A-31 47
107 and EP-A-0 337 429, while the other employs heating
elements for heating ink so as to generate bubbles as described
in, e.g., JP-B-59911/1986. Each of these two kinds of
inkjet head has its own merits and demerits. While the former
type suffers from problems in manufacturing when a certain
nozzle density and precision is required, it enjoys a high
reliability and a long service life. On the other hand, the
bubble type inkjet head presents less manufacturing problems
but its resistive heating elements tend to become damaged
over time as a result of the repeated rapid heating and
cooling and the impacts caused by collapsing bubbles, and so
the practical service life of the inkjet head is accordingly
short. Thus, none of these two kinds of inkjet heads is
really fully satisfactory.JP-A-24218/1990 discloses a method of driving an on-demand
type inkjet head of the above mentioned kind using piezoelectric
actuators. According to this drive method, during the
printer standby state, an electrical pulse is applied to the 
piezoelectric actuator in the same direction as the polarization
voltage of the actuator, thereby charging the actuator
and reducing the volume of an ink or pressure chamber. To
eject an ink droplet during printing, first, the actuator is
gradually discharged to increase the volume of the pressure
chamber, and then an electrical pulse is again applied to the
actuator to rapidly charge it and to decrease the pressure
chamber volume, thereby ejecting ink from a nozzle. To eject
the ink with greatest efficiency at a low drive voltage
level, the time for applying the electric pulse after having
discharged the actuator is selected to coincide with the peak
value of a damped vibration the ink supply system undergoes
when in response to the discharging of the actuator ink is
suctioned into the pressure chamber. This conventional drive
method is one of the best methods available for inkjet heads
using a
