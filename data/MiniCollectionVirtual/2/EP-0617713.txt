<ABSTRACT>
A method for cleaning elastomeric articles comprising contacting the elastomeric article with at least one supercritical fluid under conditions and for a time sufficient to remove the phtalates and/or polynuclear aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) contained therein. Elastomeric articles having a reduced phtalate and/or PAH content prepared by the above method are also claimed. Such elastomeric articles having reduced phtalate contents can be utilized as gaskets, valves, seats, flaps or plugs in metered dose delivery devices such as aerosols for demanding medicinal and pharmaceutical uses.

<DESCRIPTION>
METHOD FOR REMOVING RESIDUAL ADDITIVES FROM ELASTOMERIC ARTICLES .BACKGROUNDCertain elastomeric articles, ie. gaskets, valves and seats used in aerosol containers, are designed as part of the container for the efficacious delivery of pharmaceutically active compounds, ie. medicaments. As a matter of cost and convenience, such articles are derived using elastomeric materials such as elastomeric rubber and the like, specifically formulated with ingredients that enable the article to meet numerous demanding toxicological, chemical, and physical requirements. For example, gaskets and valves made of rubber are typically formulated with about six to twelve ingredients, including monomers, polymers, organic solvents, organic plasticizers, antioxidants, antiozonants, curing agents, accelerators, pigments, tackifiers, reinforcing materials and inorganic fillers such as carbon black. Nearly all cured or finished articles will inherently contain small amounts of residual components derived from these ingredients. These inherent residual components or impurities are not neccessary for performance of the article but can potentially interact with the medicament or other excipients in the formulation, leading to reduced pharmaceutical dosing. Such impurities could also interact with the container, causing it to malfunction, such as by blocking a nozzle orifice. A paper by A. Figazette et al., Analysis for Extractables FromNitrile Rubber Components in Metered Dose Inhalers, Pharmaceutical Analysis Department, SmithKline Beecham Pharmaceuticals, King of Prussia, Pennsylvania, was presented at the Symposium, "Regulatory Issues in Aerosol Drug Development", June 12-14, 1991 in Arlington Virginia by the University of Kentucky College of Pharmacy. Figazette et 

 al stated that contamination of pharmaceutical aerosols by substances leached from elastomeric valve assemblies in metered dose inhalers is a potentially serious problem. The authors present evidence that numerous extractabies could be detected in valves from various suppliers, demonstrating a need for cleaner valve rubbers with fewer leachable extractants. One class of impurities is known as the polynuclear aromatic hydrocarbons (PNAs or PAHs). Another class of impurities is known as non-PAHs, including phtalates derived from plasticizers employed during processing. Presently, conventional methods for removing PAHs and non-PAHs from rubber articles involves liquid-solid extraction and refluxing using either conventional solvents or fluorocarbon type solvents (eg.
