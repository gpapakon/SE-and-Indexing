<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a stirrer, especially for paint-stirring machines. This stirrer is provided with at least two blade elements (13) of helicoidally developed surface which are fixed, with balancing of the rotation, to the spindle, at least one of the blade elements being formed along a generatrix (5) in the horizontal plane, including, over at least part of its length, a curve of shape in the form of a spiral relative to a point forming a pole (I), for example on the stirrer spindle.

<CLAIMS>
A stirrer especially for stirring paint in paint
stirring machines, comprising a conventional stirrer shaft

(11) moved rotationally and at least one blade member (13)
for agitating the paint, characterised in that there are

provided at least two blade members (13) fixed to the shaft
and with surfaces which develop helically along the shaft, at

least one of the blade members being formed in accordance
with a surface whose line of intersection (Î´) in a plane

perpendicular to the shaft exhibits curvature over at least
part of its length which is spiral in form relative to a

point forming a pole (I) on the stirrer shaft.
A stirrer according to claim 1, characterised in that
said spiral is a logarithmically expressed cur
ve.
A stirrer according to claim 1, characterised in that
said spiral is a hyperbolically expressed curve.
A stirrer according to claim 1, characterised in that
said spiral is a curve of the Archimedes type.
A stirrer according to any one of the preceding
claims, characterised in that said blade members (13) are

symmetrical to each other with respect to an axial median
plane of the stirrer.
A stirrer according to any one of the preceding
claims, characterised in that it comprises a plurality of

blade members (13) distributed at regular angular intervals
for the purpose of dynamic rotational equilibrium.
A stirrer according to any one of the preceding
claims, characterised in that the surface of the blade (13)

comprises sectors of varied forms, for example developed
spirally within the plane over a certain portion of the

height or width and conventionally curved over another, 
thereby generating differential effects in the agitation of

the paint.
A stirrer according to any one of the preceding
claims, characterised in that said blade members (13)

comprise at their upper part a spoiler-type member promoting
agitation of the paint towards the side wall of the tin or

pot of paint.
