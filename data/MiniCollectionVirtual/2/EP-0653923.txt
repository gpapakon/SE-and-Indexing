<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to handles for surgical instruments. In
particular, this invention relates to an improved handle for hand held surgical
instruments of the type having a tool with at least one articulated member
thereon wherein the handle has a means for actuating the articulated member.Surgery is a learned art requiring many hours of advanced training
and skills development that extends far beyond a thorough understanding of the
medical principals involved, e.g., anatomy, physiology, principals of wound
healing, and the like. The surgeon must also develop hand to eye coordination
and acquire skills in the art of atraumatic tissue manipulation utilizing a variety
of highly specialized surgical instruments.The surgical instrument actually becomes an "extension" of the
surgeon's hand. The surgeon must develop an ability to "feel" and respond,
often delicately yet firmly, through his surgical instruments. Accordingly, there
exists a need for instrument handles which are sensitive, responsive and
ergonomically designed to augment the natural motions of the human hand.The apposition between thumb and the index finger is the most
sensitive and most often used means for delicate touching or for picking up small
objects in every day affairs. Prior to the present invention, however, there were 
no surgical instrument handles designed to fully utilize the sensitive and delicate
opposition capabilities of the thumb and index finger for movement of the lever
arm of an instrument handle.The actuating mechanism for handles of currently available
surgical instruments are usually configured such that the pivot point is located
between the handle lever and the articulated member (a forwardly located pivot
point). The handle can have either one or two lever arms which are moveable
about the pivot point. Such configuration is opposite to the natural pivot points
of the hand.One example of prior art handles of the type described above is the
conventional "scissors" type handle with a forward pivot point, e.g., Mayo or
Metzenbaum scissors, or Debakey forceps. The scissors handle design usually
lacks a means for biasing the instrument tool in an open position. Of necessity,
therefore, these scissors type handles have finger and thumb rings located at the
free ends of the lever arms which provide a means for receiving force and
balancing the instrument when both opening and closing the lever arms of the
handle.The scissors type handles are usually held by inserting the thumb
through the thumb ring, balancing the

surface (40) of said lever (20) adjacent the proximal end (46) thereof and the second end

of said spring is connected to the upwardly projecting arm (50) of said base (18).
The instrument of claim 4, wherein said leaf spring (52) is removably connected
to said lever (20) and said base (18) so that said leaf spring may interchangeably be

comprised of one of a plurality of leaf springs of different preselected thicknesses to
thereby varying the resistance of said biasing means.
The instrument of claim 4 or claim 5, wherein said leaf spring (52) is removably
attached to said lever (20) and said base (18) by means of machine screws (58).
The instrument of any of claims 1 to 6, wherein said actuating means comprises
an actuator rod (60) having a first end (62) and a second end, the second end of said rod

being connected to the articulated member (16) of said tool (12) and the first end (62) of
said rod being connected to the downwardly projecting actuator arm (48) of said lever

(20), wherein said rod is disposed through the body portion (26) of said base (18) such

that movement of said lever from the open to the closed position causes the first end (62)
of said rod to be displaced toward the proximal end (36) of the body portion of said base,

thereby moving the articulated member of said tool (12).

is capable of engaging the toothed surface of said pawl plate throughout the range of

motion of said handle lever;
c) a rachet lever (72) having a proximal end (86), a distal end (88), a top
surface (90) and an intermediate and central segment (92), said rachet lever being pivotally

mounted on said handle lever (20) such that said rachet lever is movable between a rest
position, wherein said rachet arm is in engagement with said pawl (68), and an operable

position, wherein said rachet arm is disengaged from said pawl, the proximal end (86) of
said ratchet lever being complementary to and received within the notch (85) of said

rachet arm (70) and movable within the notch between the rest and operable positions;
d) means for urging said rachet arm (70) into an engaged position with
respect to said pawl when said rachet lever is in the rest position; and
