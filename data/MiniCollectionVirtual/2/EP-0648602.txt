<ABSTRACT>
An improved composite fiber material comprising micro-filaments 
is provided. The material may be produced by a 

melt blown or spunbonded process and is used to form a 
micro-filament mat (12) which may be used to form a three-dimensional 

article such as an automotive headliner. The 
material is stiff enough to form three-dimensional articles 

without reinforcing structures and has improved acoustical 
properties. The micro-filament material of the present 

invention as well as the resulting three-dimensional 
article may comprise reclaimable plastics material.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates generally to a composite filament 
material and, more particularly, to a melt blown or spunbonded micro-filament mat 
and methods of using and producing the same. Since the late 1970's, one of the main constructions of automotive 
headliners has been fiberglass consisting of glasswool and having from about 10% 
to about 24% urea or a phenolic-formaldehyde resin (on a weight basis to the glass). 
The fiberglass headliners are usually compression molded at about 400°F to about 
500°F. Although these headliners have satisfactory acoustical qualities, 
manufacturing difficulties such as brittleness of the material and irritation of workers' 
skin caused by the fiberglass material, has led to the phasing out of fiberglass 
automotive headliners. In the mid- to late- 1980's, thermoformable and thermocrushable 
foams began replacing fiberglass in automotive headliners. These foams are 
generally polyurethane foams. Although polyurethane foams have satisfactory 
acoustical qualities for automotive headliners, their acoustical properties are not 
equal to fiberglass on a cost basis. Furthermore, polyurethane foam systems have 
a relatively long cure time, i.e. approximately 24 to about 48 hours. A further draw-back in using polyurethane foams in the manufacture 
of automotive headliners is the waste incurred when the foam is sliced; in some 
systems only about 65% of the original polyurethane poured is usable and the 
remainder is scrapped. Also, layers of sheets of the polyurethane foam must be 
used to establish the proper thickness and stiffness and reinforcing structures may 
also be required to form three-dimensional articles. It would thus be desirable to provide an improved material for 
producing three-dimensional articles that does not require reinforcing structures to 
form the article. It would also be desirable to provide a material for producing three-dimensional 
articles, which has a variable thickness. It would further be desirable 
to provide a material with improved sound absorptive and/or sound deadening 
properties, i.e. improved acoustical properties. It would also be desirable to provide 
a material with improved acoustical properties which may be used to produce three-dimensional 
articles. It would further be desirable to provide a material with 
improved acoustical properties which may be used to produce automotive  
 
headliners. It would also be desirable to provide a material for producing automotive 
headliners which is relatively inexpensive. It would
