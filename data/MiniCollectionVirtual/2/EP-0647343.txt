<ABSTRACT>
A transducer arrangement for active noise cancellation in conduits, for example in motor vehicles comprising an enclosed chamber partitioned to expose a first transducer side to a first chamber portion (34) and a second transducer side to a second chamber portion (36). A first port (39) couples one of the chambers (34, 36) to the other and a second port (41) couples one of the chambers to the conduit (14). Each port for communicating with the conduit can be tuned to resonate at predetermined frequencies. When both sides of the transducer are so coupled to the conduit, the transducer has increased efficiency over a band of frequencies, to accommodate the frequencies generated by a source of noise while limiting access of fluid or heat in the conduit to the transducer. A transducer arrangement according to the present invention reduces vibration of the housing. The system is particularly suitable for use in adapting noise cancellation techniques to replace or combine with passive mufflers on motor vehicles.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates generally to noise 
reduction apparatus, and more particularly to transducer 
constructions for active sound cancellation devices made 
applicable for use with motor vehicles. Reference is made to co-pending US patent applications 
serial no. 514,624, filed April 25, 1990 entitled "Active 
Muffler Transducer Arrangement" and Serial No. 868,151, 
filed April 14, 1992 entitled "Tandem Transducer Magnet 
Structure". Internal combustion engines typically used in motor 
vehicles generate a substantial amount of noise due to the 
combustion occurring within the engine. Conventionally, the 
noise generated is suppressed by a passive muffler system in 
which the sound waves are broken up by resonance with 
baffles, passageways and the like or absorbed by fibrous 
material. However, such techniques of reducing the sound 
level also obstruct the free flow of exhaust gases through 
the exhaust conduits and therefore substantially interfere 
with efficient operation of the vehicle engine by 
interfering with the release of combustion products and 
inhibiting the replacement of the combusted gases with fresh 
fuel in the engine cylinders. Nevertheless, despite the 
reduction in economy and performance, the need for 
substantially reduced noise levels requires the use of 
mufflers on all production motor vehicles. Although active noise cancellation systems have been 
employed with large ducts used for heating and ventilation 
in large buildings, the previously known systems are not 
well adapted for use in the environment of motor vehicles. 
For example, U.S. Patent No. 4,473,906 to Warnaka et al. 
discloses numerous prior art sound attenuation system 
embodiments. In general, sensed sound pressure produces a 
signal adapted to drive a loudspeaker for inputting 
cancellation signals into the duct. The cancellation signal 
is an acoustic pulse signal 180- out of phase with the  
 
signal passing past the speaker through the duct. The prior 
art embodiments also illustrate improved noise attenuation 
performance by reducing the effect of the feedback of the 
cancellation signal which arrives at the sensor. The patent 
discusses the inclusion of additional transducers and 
electronic controls to improve the performance of the active 
acoustic attenuator. U.S. Patent No. 4,677,677 to Eriksson further improves 
attenuation by including an adaptive filter with on-line 
modeling of the error path and the cancelling speaker by 
using a recursive algorithm without dedicated off-line 
pretraining.
