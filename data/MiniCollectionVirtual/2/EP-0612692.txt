<ABSTRACT>
Water purifying substances produced by mixing raw material 
soil containing allophane expressed by: 


nSiO₂.Al₂O₃.mH₂O
where, n is a number within the range of 1.3 to 2, and m 
is a number within the range of 2.5 to 3 at the maximum 

larger than 0, with water, and sintering a mixture thus 
obtained at 200°C to 700°C, consequently to form porous 

sintered particles having a function of absorbing and 
fixing phosphoric acid. By scattering the water purifying 

substances around a lake, marsh or other watering places, 
nutritious phosphoric acid in sludge accumulated in the 

lake and so on can be effectively captured. The purifying 
effect of the water purifying substance can be improved by 

adding polyaluminum chloride and/or ferrous sulfate to the 
raw material soil.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to water purifying substances
having high ability to fix phosphoric acid and a method
for producing the same, and more particularly to a water
purifying substance capable of decreasing phosphoric acid
contained in sludge accumulated on the bottom of a sewer,
lake or the like.Recently, the nitrogen and phosphorous contents in wastes
or scraps are increasing, thus involving an environmental
problem from the viewpoint of the environmental protection
such that wastes containing such nutritious matters for
the land are dumped into river, lake, marsh or other
watering places. In a sense, the environment system is
nourished by various wastes and scraps fortified with
plenty or nutritious salts such as nitrogen and
phosphorous, which flow into the sea, river, lake or marsh
via the drainage basins. Thus, the wastes of high
nutritive value primarily for plant plankton are
accumulated on the bottom of the lake or others.With increasing the nourishment of the environment system,
harmful plant plankton such as water-bloom and red tide is
bred on a massive scale, thus dyeing the water of the lake
or other watering places green or brown. The environmental
pollution often causes damage to the marine products
industry, fish-raising industry and so forth, and anxiety
about safety of living water.There are thought two causes of supplying phosphoric acid
serving as a nutrient for microorganisms to the
environmental system such as a lake and so on, as
follows:
(1) Waste water fortified with phosphoric acid
flows into the lake or the like. (2) Phosphoric acid held in sludge accumulate
on the lake bottom eludes.The route of supplying the phosphoric acid to the lake or
marsh has been shut off by the following methods.
(A) To solve the aforenoted problem (a), there may be
adopted a method of absorbing the pollutant in question by
use of adhering biological membrane as used in a common
liquid-waste treatment, an absorbent such as activated
charcoal capable of absorbing even small quantities of
organic and stinking substances, or a modern reaction
device of an ozone-oxidation type, thus cleaning up city
water to a high degree.(B) A method for solving the aforenoted problem (b) has
been practiced by scattering sand all over the lake or
other watering places to confine the sludge.However, it has been so far difficult to completely cut
off the route of phosphoric acid flowing into the lake or
marsh and prevent the wastes from being fortified by the
reasons mentioned below.To be more specific, the former method

A method for producing a water purifying substance,
which comprises adding polyaluminum chloride and/or ferrous

sulfate to a soil containing allophanes to obtain a mixture,
and sintering said mixture at 200°C to 700°C to form porous

sintered particles having an average particle size of 1mm to
20mm, wherein said allophane is expressed by:


nSiO
