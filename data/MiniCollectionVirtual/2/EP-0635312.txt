<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to an ultrasonic atomizer
for pumping up a liquid from a liquid vessel by an
ultrasonic pump and atomizing the liquid by passing it
through a mesh plate formed to have multiplicity of
minute holes, an ultrasonic inhaler serving as one
application of the ultrasonic atomizer, and a method of
controlling the operation of the inhaler.A known example of an ultrasonic atomizer of this
type is described in the specification of
JP-U-3-15674. The
atomizer described in this literature is characterized
by use of a mesh plate having tapered minute holes which
flare from one side of the plate toward the other.
The mesh plate is arranged in such a manner that the
side in which the minute holes have the openings of
larger diameter opposes the upper end face of the pump
shaft of an ultrasonic pump, and such that a minute gap
is produced between the mesh plate and the upper end
face of the pump shaft.In an ultrasonic atomizer, it is important to
achieve balance between the amount of liquid pumped by
the ultrasonic pump and the amount of atomization
produced by the mesh plate. When there is a minute gap 
between the upper end face of the pump shaft and the
mesh plate, as in the document mentioned above, the
amount of liquid pumped tends to be larger than the
amount of liquid atomized. The liquid that is not
atomized flows down from the gap to the upper portion
(the horn) of the pump shaft and becomes a load on
ultrasonic vibration at the horn. This causes an
unstable spraying operation and can lead to cessation of
operation in some cases.Another problem is that the user's fingers become
soiled when liquid that has not been atomized flows out
of the device. An important technical problem is
assuring the liquid tightness of the device.The number of minute holes formed in the mesh plate
has a direct influence upon the amount of atomization.
The greater the number of minute holes per unit surface
area, the greater the amount of atomization. When the
number of minute holes is increased, however, there is a
decline in the strength of the mesh plate itself. There
is a need for some expedient which can provide strength
while allowing an increase in the number of minute
holes.Since the mesh plate described in the above-mentioned
document is such that the minute holes have
aperture diameters that differ on the two sides of the
plate, care must be taken in terms of the orientation of
these sides when the mesh plate is mounted in the
atomizer. An ultrasonic atomizer can be applied to an
ultrasonic inhaler, as
