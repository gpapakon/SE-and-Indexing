<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to integrated 
optical waveguide circuits used in optical 
components for optical communications and optical 
information processing, more specifically to an 
integrated optical waveguide comprising an optical 
power splitter integrated with an arrayed-waveguide 
grating wavelength multiplexer, and an optical line 
test system for testing individual optical lines 
using the integrated optical circuit in a passive 
double star (PDS) system for branching an optical 
line using only passive optical components. Recently, with the advance in an optical 
communication system and with the aim of expanding 
application of the optical communication system, 
various types of optical waveguide circuit 
components have been developed. In particular, a 
planar lightwave circuit comprising glass waveguides 
formed on a silicon substrate is drawing attention 
as a practical optical component for its reduced 
optical loss. A typical circuit of this kind is an 
arrayed-waveguide grating wavelength multiplexer, 
which is disclosed in H. Takahashi, K. Kato, and I.  
 
Nishi, "Arrayed-Waveguide grating for wavelength 
division multi/demultiplexer with nanometer 
resolution," Electron. Lett., vol. 26, pp. 87-88, 
1990 and A. R. Vellekoop and M. K. Smit, "Four-Channel 
Integrated-Optic Wavelength Demultiplexer 
with Weak Polarization Dependence", J. Lightwave 
Technol. vol. 9, pp. 310-314 (1991). Further, as an 
example of an optical power splitter, one which uses 
light diffraction in a slab optical waveguide is 
disclosed in S. Day, E. Bellerby, G. Cannel, and M. 
Grant, "Silicon based fiber pigtailed 1 × 16 
splitter," Electron. Lett., vol. 28, pp. 920-922, 
1992, and an N × M splitter is described in C. 
Dragone et al. "Efficient Multichannel Integrated 
Optics Star Coupler on Silicon", IEEE Photonic Tech. 
Lett. vol. 1, pp. 241-243 (1989). Construction of an arrayed-waveguide grating 
wavelength multiplexer is shown in Fig. 1. The 
arrayed-waveguide grating wavelength multiplexer 
comprises a plurality of input optical waveguides 
301 formed on a substrate 1, a slab optical 
waveguide 401 for demultiplexing the light to the 
plurality of waveguides, a plurality of arrayed-waveguides 
302 with different lengths disposed after 
the slab optical waveguide 401, and slab optical 
waveguides 402 for making interference of light 
emitted from the arrayed-waveguides 302, and a 
plurality of output optical waveguides 308. The arrayed-waveguide grating wavelength
