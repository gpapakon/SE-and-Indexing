<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to housings for 
transmitter/receiver units, and in particular to housings for 
transmitter/receiver units for use in radio local area networks 
(LANs). Notebook computers are presently being produced which are 
equipped to accept Personal Computer Memory Card International 
Association (PCMCIA) memory expansion cards, and 
transmitter/receiver units are being developed which plug in in 
place of such memory expansion cards. These units, which comprise 
a computer interface, a LAN controller and radio 
transmitter/receiver circuits operating at Carrier frequencies of 
the order of 2.4GHz, can provide 1 Mbit/sec data links for such 
notebook computers over in-building ranges of a hundred feet or 
more. According to one aspect of the present invention a housing 
for a local area network radio transmitter/receiver unit for a 
computer comprises a first part cooperable with plug and socket 
connector means of the computer for the transfer of data between 
said transmitter/receiver unit and said computer, and a second part 
connected to said first part for pivotal movement relative to said 
first part between a first position in which said parts are at least 
closely adjacent one another and a second position in which said 
second part is rotated to lie at an angle to the direction of 
insertion of said first part into said plug and socket connector  
 
means, said second part housing at least the antenna means of said 
transmitter/receiver unit. According to another aspect of the present invention a 
local area network radio transmitter/receiver unit for use with a 
computer equipped with socket means arranged to accept a PCMCIA 
memory expansion card comprises a two-part housing of which a first 
part is adapted for insertion into said socket means in place of a 
PCMCIA memory expansion card and a second part is connected to said 
first part for pivotal movement relative to said first part between 
a closed or transit position in which said parts lie at least 
closely adjacent one another and an operative position in which said 
second part is rotated relative to said first part such that said 
first part may be inserted into said socket means. Preferably said first part of said housing carries 
interface circuit means, and said second part of said housing 
carries at least the antenna means of said transmitter/receiver 
unit. The two parts maybe connected by means of a double hinge 
arrangement having means to retain or to bias the two parts in 
particular angular

<CLAIMS>
A housing for a local area network radio 
transmitter/receiver unit for a computer comprising a first part 

cooperable with plug and socket connector means of the computer for 
the transfer of data between said transmitter/receiver unit and said 

computer, and a second part connected to said first part for pivotal 
movement relative to said first part between a first position in 

which said parts are at least closely adjacent one another and a 
second position in which said second part is rotated to lie at an 

angle to the direction of insertion of said first part into said 
plug and socket connector means, said second part housing at least 

the antenna means of said transmitter/receiver unit. 
A local area network radio transmitter/receiver unit for 
use with a computer equipped with socket means arranged to accept a 

PCMCIA memory expansion card comprising a two-part housing of which 
a first part is adapted for insertion into said socket means in 

place of a PCMCIA memory expansion card and a second part is 
connected to said first part for pivotal movement relative to said 

first part between a closed or transit position in which said parts 
lie at least closely adjacent one another and an operative position 

in which said second part is rotated relative to said first part 
such that said first part may be inserted into said socket means. 
A transmitter/receiver unit in accordance with Claim 2 
wherein said first part of said housing carries interface circuit 

means, and said second part of said housing carries at least the 
antenna means of said transmitter/receiver unit. 
A transmitter/receiver unit in accordance with Claim 2 or 
Claim 3 wherein the two parts are connected by means of a double 

hinge arrangement having means to retain or to bias the two parts in 
particular angular relationships. 
A transmitter/receiver unit in accordance with Claim 2,or 
Claim 3 wherein the second part of said housing is arranged 

partially to enclose the first part in said closed position.
