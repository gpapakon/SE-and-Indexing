<ABSTRACT>
The invention makes possible the operation of a machine tool or of a robot without the use of previously necessary limit switches. This is made possible in that a continuous two-channel secure determination of travel is carried out which proceeds from a position detection system (11) having absolute and incremental transmitters (A, I), links up to two processor systems (CPU1, CPU2) from the numeric part (16) and the drive control (12) and then acts on secure relays (33, 34) in the emergency stop circuit of the system.

<CLAIMS>
Device for the control of at least one drive
of a machine tool or a robot, wherein two different

position-detecting devices act at the drive and wherein
the control device has two processor systems, of which

the one preferably takes on the traversing-program
processing and the position control and the other looks

after rotational-speed and current-control tasks,
characterised in that the drive position is separately

ascertained from the output signal of each of the two
position-detecting devices (11A, 11I), and in that in

each of the two processor systems (CPU1, CPU2) the
separately ascertained drive positions of the two

position-detecting devices are monitored independently
for equality and the observance of a predeterminable

positional range, and in that if inequality is detected
a respective disturbance signal is triggered.
Device according to claim 1, characterised in
that both processor systems (CPU1, CPU2) are formed

differently both in terms of their hardware and in
terms of their software.
Device according to one of the preceding
claims, characterized in that reciprocal processormonitoring

arrangements (30, 31) when actuated also
trigger a disturbance signal.
Device according to one of the preceding
claims, characterised in that voltage-monitoring

devices (32, 35) for at least one of the processor
systems (CPU1) when actuated in response to voltage

disturbance also trigger a disturbance signal.
Device according to one of the preceding
claims, characterised in that the disturbance signal

acts on at least one safety relay (33, 34) in the
emergency stop circuit of the whole system. 
Device according to one of the preceding
claims, characterised in that when a disturbance signal

occurs, a rotational-speed setpoint value cut-off is
effected preferably in accordance with a jump or ramp

function in at least one of the processor systems.
Device according to one of the preceding
claims, characterised in that when a disturbance signal

occurs, a path-controlled cut-off is effected by way of
an apparatus-related velocity profile.
Device according to one of the preceding
claims, characterized in that in the case of

comparatively high velocities and/or comparatively
large moving masses an automatic reduction in the

predetermined positional range is effected.
