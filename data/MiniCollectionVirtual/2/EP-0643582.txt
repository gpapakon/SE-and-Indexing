<CLAIMS>
Process for obtaining a solution of platelet
factors comprising a stage of thrombocyte activation by

bringing into contact with a thrombocyte activator
solution, and in which a solution of platelet factors

released by the thrombocytes during the activation stage
is collected, characterized in that a liquid containing

a suspension of thrombocytes is passed through a filter
capable of retaining the thrombocytes, in that an

activator solution is added to the thrombocytes retained
on the filter and in that a filtrate containing the

platelet factors in solution is separated by filtration
whereas the thrombocytes remain retained on the filter.
Process according to Claim 1, characterized in
that, before adding the activator solution, an appropriate

washing solution is added to the thrombocytes
retained on the filter and in that the washing solution

is removed by filtration.
Process according to Claim 1 or 2, characterized
in that a deep-filtration system is used as filter.
Process according to Claim 1 or 2, characterized
in that a microporous filtration system made of hollow

fibres is used as filter.
