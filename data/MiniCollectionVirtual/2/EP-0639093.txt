<ABSTRACT>
A golf putter is disclosed which has a head (1) comprising a body having a central plane (6), an attachment means for attaching a shaft (2) parallel to the central plane (6), and a front face (4) for striking a golf ball (3), the front face (4) being at a negative angle (A DEG ) to the central plane so that a bottom edge of the front face is closer to the central plane than is a top edge of the front face and wherein the centre of gravity of the head is substantially aligned with a point on the front face which is the point of impact of a golf ball. Preferably the negative angle (A DEG ) is of the order 5 DEG -7 DEG . Further within the head of the club is disposed a cavity which is dimensioned such that the front face is defined by a relatively thin wall.

<DESCRIPTION>
 GOLF PUTTER HEAD Field of the InventionThis invention relates golf clubs, particularly golf putters and more particularly the head of a golf putter. Background to the InventionGolf club heads have a front face which is used to contact the ball to be hit, and thus to exchange energy from the club to the ball. For woods and driving irons the front face is at a positive angle to drive the ball upwards, as well as forwards, when hit. The angles vary from club to club allowing the player to select the desired amount of lift for a particular shot. Putters, for use close to the hole, generally have little or no angle as they are intended to push the ball across the playing surface without any lift. Some players slightly pull their putter upwards as its strikes the ball so as to produce top spin and encourage more run on or distance for the same force. Disclosure of the Invention The present invention provides a putter that has a negative angle on the front face. The front face will normally hit the ball above centre and therefore may produce top spin on the ball without a need to develop a particular putting style. Thus, .when hitting the ball with the putter in accordance with this invention, the ball tends to be pushed and rolled, not merely pushed along the playing surface.Accordingly, in a first aspect the present invention consists in a golf club head comprising a body having a central plane, an attachment means for attaching a shaft parallel to the central plane, and a front face for striking a golf ball, the front face being at a negative angle to the central plane so that a bottom edge of the front face is closer to the central plane than is a top edge of the front face and wherein the centre of gravity 

of the head is substantially aligned with a point of the front face which is the point of impact of a golf ball.In one form the club head has two opposed front faces, both at equal negative angles so that the body is in the form of a narrow wedge, the narrowest end of the wedge facing vertically downward as it strikes the ball. In a second aspect, this invention further consists in a golf club head having an attachment means for attaching a shaft thereto and a front face for striking a golf ball characterised in that within the head is disposed a cavity which is dimensioned such that the front face is defined by a relatively thin wall.In another form, the club head comprises a body having a central plane, an attachment means for attaching a shaft parallel to the central plane, a front face for

CLAIMS
1. A golf club head comprising a body having a central plane, an attachment means for attaching a shaft parallel to the central plane, and a front face for striking a golf ball, the front face being at a negative angle to the central plane so that a bottom edge of the front face is closer to the central plane than is a top edge of the front face and wherein the centre of gravity of the head is substantially aligned with a point on the front face which is the point of impact of a golf ball.
2. A golf club head as in claim 1 wherein the negative angle is in the range of from 4 -8 .
3. A golf club head as in claim 1 or claim 2 wherein the negative angle is in the range of.from 5Â°-7 . 4. A golf club head as in any one of claims 1 to 3 wherein the head has two opposed front faces, both at equal negative angles so that the body is in the form of a narrow wedge, the narrowest end of the wedge facing vertically downward as it strikes the ball. 5. A golf club head as in any one of claims 1 to 4 wherein a cavity is disposed within the head, which cavity is dimensioned such that the front face is defined by a relatively thin wall.
6. A golf club head as in claim 5 wherein the wall is from 3-5mm thick.
7. A golf club head as in claim 6 wherein the wall is about 3mm thick.
8. A golf putter including a golf club head as claimed in any one of claims 1 to 7. 9. A golf club head having an attachment means for attaching a shaft thereto and a front face for striking a golf ball characterised in that within the head is disposed a cavity which is dimensioned such that the front face is defined by a relatively thin wall. 10. A golf club head as in claim 9 wherein the wall is 


from 3-5mm thick.
