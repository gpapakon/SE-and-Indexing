<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a
feeding device and a method for quantatively feeding powder, and
more particularly relates to a multi-dose powdered medicine
administering device. Still more particularly, the present
invention relates to a multi-dose powdered medicine
administering device and method thereof by which a unit-dose
of powdered medicine, of a constant quantity, is
continuously extracted from a quantity of stored powdered
medicine and given to the patient a unit-dose of medicine
(adminstration of multi-dose).The device of the present invention is used as a multi-dose
powdered medicine dispenser by which a unit-dose of
powdered medicine of a constant quantity can be continuously
divided from a multi-dose of powdered medicine and
administered into the body cavity such as the nasal cavity
by spraying.Further, the device of the present invention is used as
a multi-dose powdered medicine dispenser by which a unit-dose
of powdered medicine of a constant quantity can be
quantitatively extracted from a larger quantity of powdered
medicine and administered into the body cavity such as the
trachea, a bronchus or a lung by means of inhalation.Powdered medicine is administered into a body cavity
such as the nasal cavity or the oral cavity, and air ways
such as the trachea, a bronchus or a lung by means of
spraying or inhalation. For example, powdered medicine is
administered into the nasal cavity or the air ways of a
patient suffering from nasal allergy or asthma. Recently,
attention has been given to a drug delivery system in which
medicine is absorbed into the bloodstream through the mucous 
membrane of the nasal cavity or lung and it is attempted to
administer powdered medicine via the mucous membrane.When medicine is administered in the above manner, a
powdered medicine administering device is used. Powdered
medicine administering devices are classified into two types
according to the storage system for the powdered medicine.In the first type of powdered medicine administering
device, a quantity of powdered medicine to be administered
in a single operation is accommodated in an appropriate
container. A unit-dose powdered medicine is accommodated in
an appropriate capsule. Therefore, a unit-dose of powdered
medicine is administered at each administering operation.
In the second type of powdered medicine administering
device, a quantity of powdered medicine to be administered
in a plurality of operations is accommodated in an
appropriate container. Each time an administering operation
is carried out,
