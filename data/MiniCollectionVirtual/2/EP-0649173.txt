<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a semi-custom semiconductor 
device adapted for a master slice approach such as a gate 
array and embedded cell array and a method for fabricating 
the same. More particularly, it relates to a semiconductor 
device capable of sharing a mask for forming connection 
holes in steps of forming custom wiring for fabricating a 
semi-custom semiconductor device adapted for a master slice 
approach to form a desired logic, and a method for 
fabricating the semiconductor device which method can 
reduce the number of the steps of forming the custom wiring 
and shorten the period taken until product delivery. In semiconductor devices such as IC and LSI, a variety 
of elements are formed on a semiconductor substrate and 
electrically interconnected by applying wiring lines 
between the elements. The recent advance in integration 
and miniaturization of elements requires to use a multi-level 
wiring structure of two or more layers for interconnection. 
Then in semiconductor devices, for example, 
semi-custom semiconductor devices intended for a master 
slice approach such as gate arrays, elements formed on a 
semiconductor substrate are electrically connected by way 
of through-holes. In the case of a gate array, for  
 
example, a diffusion layer and a gate constituting a basic 
cell and a first wiring layer are electrically connected 
through contact holes, and wiring layers, for example, 
first and second wiring layers are electrically connected 
through via holes. In the fabrication of a gate array, a common master 
wafer is prepared using a common diffusion mask and 
insulating mask which are previously designed and 
fabricated. A specific metal wiring layer-forming mask 
corresponding to a logic circuit design is designed and 
prepared. By using such a mask in the final step of 
processing the semiconductor wafer, a circuit design term 
is shortened. To facilitate the designing of a gate array, 
that is, to facilitate the designing of a specific metal 
wiring layer (custom wiring layer) corresponding to a 
circuit design, JP-A 28786/1975 discloses to form a custom 
wiring layer by using a grid structure having a uniform 
lattice spacing, thereby facilitating the designing of a 
semiconductor device by means of a computer. FIG. 7 illustrates the structure of a wiring grid 
having a uniform lattice spacing relative to basic cells in 
a prior art gate array. A basic cell 102 includes a 
diffusion layer 104 consisting of a P type (p⁺) diffusion 
layer 104a and a N type (n⁺) diffusion
