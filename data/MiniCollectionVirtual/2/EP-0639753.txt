<ABSTRACT>
Spectral reflection ratios with respect to a second wavelength range are 
obtained and Fourier transformed to derive frequency converted spectrum. A power 

spectrum is obtained from the frequency converted spectrum to identified a peak 
which expresses interference caused by a silicon film. An approximate value d2' 

of the film thickness of the silicon film is calculated based on the peak position. 
After filtered by low-pass filtering, the frequency converted spectrum is reverse 

Fourier transformed to obtain spectral reflectance. From the spectral reflectance, 
theoretical spectral reflection ratios which are theoretically derived on only one 

transparent film of the thickness d3 which is formed on a silicon layer are 
subtracted. An approximate value d1' of the thickness of a silicon oxide film is 

then calculated from the spectral reflectance which are obtained by subtraction.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a non-contact,
non-destructive method of measuring film thicknesses of a
multilayered sample object in which one or two transparent
films are disposed on a substrate which is formed by
a body, a transparent insulation film and a monocrystalline
or polycrystalline silicon film. The substrate may be an SOI substrate.In recent years, fabrication of a large scale
integration (LSI) on a Silicon/Silicon Oxide (SOI)
substrate has been becoming popular. Figures 15 and 16 are
cross sectional views each showing an SOI substrate which
serves as background of the present invention. In Figures
15 and 16, a silicon oxide film (transparent insulation
film) 1 is formed on a silicon body B and a monocrystalline
silicon film 2 is formed on the silicon oxide film 1,
thereby constituting an SOI substrate 10. As compared with
a conventional LSI (which is built on a bulk semiconductor
substrate), an LSI built on the SOI substrate 10 has better
device characteristics.However, as fabrication of an LSI on an SOI
substrate becomes increasingly more complex, control of
film thicknesses needs to be more accurate than ever. In
some cases, thicknesses d1 and d2 of the silicon oxide film
1 and the silicon film 2 which are formed on the silicon
body B need to be measured. In other cases, where one or
two transparent films are to be formed on the SOI substrate
10 during fabrication of an LSI, it is necessary to measure
thicknesses d3 and d4 of these transparent films during the
fabrication (For example, a silicon oxide film 3 needs to
be formed in Figure 15 and a silicon oxide film 3 and a
silicon nitride film 4 need to be formed in Figure 16).
Further, the need is mounting to measure the thickness d1
to d4 at the same time. Of course, measurement of the 
thicknesses d1 to d4 must be non-contact and non-destructive
since the thicknesses must be measured during
fabrication of an LSI.Despite such needs, non-contact and non-destructive
measurement of the respective thicknesses of the
multilayered samples of Figures 15 and 16 is difficult. In
reality, there has been no choice but to measure the
thicknesses by destructing a multilayered sample object and
observing the destructed sample object with an electron
microscope or the like.To improve the situation, techniques for measuring
the thickness of each layer of a multilayered sample object
have been proposed such as that disclosed by US-A-4 999
509. According to the disclosed technique, a film
thickness range of each layer is inputted in advance and
