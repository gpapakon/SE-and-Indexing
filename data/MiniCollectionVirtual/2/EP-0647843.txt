<ABSTRACT>
The present invention relates to a device for 
measuring the damping coefficient that characterizes the 

shock-absorbing system mounted on a vehicle by comparing 
the force applied by a platform, which is vertically 

movable with a suitable amplitude and at a variable 
frequency and on which one wheel of a vehicle rests, and 

the applied vibration. The damping coefficient is obtained 
as a function of the derivative, with respect to the 

frequency, of the relative phase function between the force 
transferred to the platform and the movement of the 

platform.

<DESCRIPTION>
Devices for measuring the degree of efficiency of
motor vehicle suspensions without having to remove the
shock absorber from the vehicle are well-known in the art.
Several different principles are used for this purpose. For
example, the principle of making a vehicle-supporting
platform oscillate at variable speeds and of measuring the
force transferred to the ground by the suspension is used.If the minimum contact force between the platform and
the wheel is obtained in a test in which the oscillation
frequency is changed, and if this value is correlated with
the static force (weight) of the vehicle, one obtains a
value that according to the EUSAMA (European Shock Absorber
Manufacturer Association), publication TS0276, is
representative of the roadholding of the vehicle and of the
state of the suspension. This has been assuredly proved and
used on commercially available devices, but the read value
depends not only on the state of the shock absorber, which
is a mechanical element that is specifically meant to
reduce the oscillations of the vehicle and to ensure
traveling comfort and safety, but also on constructive
qualities that characterize the suspension, such as the
ratio between suspended masses and non-suspended masses,
the type of tire, the inflation pressure, and the
suspension type. Dependency on numerous parameters in
practice prevents the above defined value from being
adequately representative of the state of the shock
absorber in itself and therefore prevents this value from
being interpreted unequivocally if one seeks to give a 
certain indication of the need to replace the shock
absorber. Similar problems have been found in many other
commercially available shock-absorber testing machines,
where dependency of the measurement on many physical
parameters of the suspension leads to the need to interpret
the data obtained from the measurement instrument by using
tables that are compiled for each individual vehicle. This
of course leads to approximations and to wide margins of
error, due to the intrinsic difficulty in keeping the
tables updated. Furthermore, if one considers the common
habit of some vehicle manufacturers of fitting different
shock absorbers on manufactured cars belonging to the same
model depending on the market on which they are to be sold,
it is evident that such a comparison method based on tables
is scarcely reliable.FR-A-2 354 553 discloses a device for measuring the
