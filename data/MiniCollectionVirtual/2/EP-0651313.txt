<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a method for data protection on magnetic tape and for data retrieval protection. According to the invention, the functional sequence is configured in such a way that, in the case of data protection, the data are collected from the respective files or memories and transmitted via a network connection to the data protection system and transferred there to a magnetic tape, according to the invention the data stream being implemented continuously, without the data to be protected being stored in a buffer. The speed and reliability of the data protection are thus increased. By analogy, the functional sequence is implemented in reverse for data retrieval protection.

A method for data backup by using a magnetic tape, including reading data
to be backed up from at least a data file or a memory, collecting the data as a data

save set in a data pack-up device, setting up a network interconnection to a data
backup system using the magnetic tape, transmitting the data save set through the

network interconnection and recording the data save set on the magnetic tape, characterized
in that the network interconnection between the data pack-up device (6)

and the data backup system (3) as well as to the magnetic tape (11) in the data
backup system is set up with start of data collection; that the data save set is transmitted

in a continuous data stream without being temporarily stored; and that the
continuous data stream is directly recorded on the magnetic tape.
A method for data restoring, including searching and reading data stored
on a magnetic tape, setting up a network interconnection between the data backup

system and at least a data file or a memory, and transmitting the data via the network
interconnection to a data distributing device, and the data distributing device

reading the data into at least a data file or a memory, characterized in that the network
interconnection between the data backup system and the data distributing device

is set up with start of reading out the data from the magnetic tape; that the data
save set is transmitted in a continuous data stream without being temporarily stored;

and that the data stream is directly transmitted through the data distributing means
into the data file or the memory.
The method of claim 1 or 2, wherein a computer (1) comprising a memory
for storing the data to be backed up is connected through an interface (8) to the network

interconnection (2) and the data backup system (3) is connected through an
interface (9) to the network interconnection (2), characterized by transmitting the

continuous data stream between the data collecting device (6) or the data distributing
device (6), respectively, and the interface (8) of the computer (1) via a pipeline

(7) and interrupting the collecting or distributing step when no data are transmitted
from the respective output of the pipeline.
