<ABSTRACT>
For the combustion of loose synthetic resin material, in particular ion exchanger resins, dry resins mixed with granulated alumina or moist masses are blown together with air for combustion with air supply into the lower region of a fluidised bed with excess granulated alumina which, in particular, has a particle size of 
<
/= 1 mm, especially 100-400  mu m, and preferably is present in the furnace in a quantity more than 5 times that of the resin. Cation exchangers are burnt with an oxygen excess, especially with a total lambda value of 
>
/= 2, whereas in the case of anion exchanger resins, less than stoichiometric quantities of oxygen are provided in the lower zone, especially with lambda values of between 0.5 and 0.8. Advantageously, the fluidised bed is designed as a two-zone fluidised bed with a lower stationary fluidised bed (especially a rotating bed) and an upper circulating bed. Temperatures of 900 DEG C are advantageous. Especially, additives such as, for example, lime for the absorption of sulphur oxide are blown into the upper region.
