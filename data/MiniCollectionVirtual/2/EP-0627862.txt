<ABSTRACT>
A telecommunications network service has a number used to route a call through 
the network which includes means of identifying a call-related message passed over a 

separate unrelated message path. 
An Intelligent Network Architecture as above may be used with a 
telecommunications system including a Virtual Private Network (VPN), the VPN 

comprising a plurality of Private Branch Exchanges (PBX), each PBX having a 
connection to a public telephone network and to an Intelligent Network (I.N.) within the 

system wherein, when a VPN call is initiated by a user connected to a PBX the PBX 
sends a message via the I.N. to the destination PBX, also a connection is made between 

the PBX and the local exchange and a message is sent from the local exchange via the 
I.N. to a VPN Service Point, whereupon the Service Point establishes a connection, via 

the I.N. between the user local exchange and the destination PBX.

<DESCRIPTION>
In co-pending Application No. GB 2272603A entitled "Intelligent Network 
Architecture" imported herein by reference, is described an Intelligent Network (IN) 
architecture having separated service control and bearer (call) control, the service control 
information being conveyed by a separate message network. By providing access to the message network from Private Branch Exchanges 
(PBX) and by providing an appropriate IN service as herein described, the architecture 
described in the above application enables the provision of Virtual Private Networks 
(VPN) without further alternation of public network equipment. VPN calls are processed by an IN service in order to separate the VPN traffic 
from the public network traffic for charging and call-logging purposes. Otherwise the 
function of the IN VPN-service is very simple. This proposition concentrates upon the provision of ordinary speech connections 
between remote PBX extensions; the IN architecture employed provides access via the 
public network to other IN services that may be of value to VPN's. An organisation with PBX's at several sites may form a private network by 
interconnecting the PBX's and handling inter-PBX traffic without using the public 
network. By including the ability to transmit messages over the private network, the 
networking of sophisticated PBX call-handling facilities is enabled. The private network 
numbering scheme typically has a 3-digit site identifier and 4-digit extension number. A VPN provides identical services to a physical private network by establishing  
 
inter-PBX call connections on demand via the public network, thereby totally eliminating 
the need for dedicated circuits interconnecting the PBX's. According to the present invention there is provided a telecommunications 
network service in which the number used to route a call through the network includes 
means of identifying a call-related message passed over a separate unrelated message 
path. The present invention will now be described by way of example, with reference 
to the accompanying single figure, in which is shown the establishment of a typical VPN 
call. The telecommunications system includes a Virtual Private Network (VPN), the 
VPN comprising a plurality of Private Branch Exchanges (PBX), each PBX having a 
connection to a public telephone network and to an Intelligent Network (I.N.) within the 
system wherein, when a VPN call is initiated by a user connected to a PBX, the PBX 
sends a message via the I.N. to the destination PBX, also a

<CLAIMS>
A telecommunications network system in which the number used to route a call 
through the network includes means of identifying a call-related message passed over a 

separate unrelated message path. 
A telecommunications system as claimed in Claim 1 including a Virtual Private 
Network (VPN), the VPN comprising a plurality of Private Branch Exchanges (PBX), 

each PBX having a connection to a public telephone network and to an Intelligent 
Network (I.N.) within the system wherein, when a VPN cell is initiated by a user 

connected to a PBX, the PBX sends a message via the I.N. to the destination PBX, also 
a connection is made between the PBX and the local exchange and a message is sent 

from the local exchange via the I.N. to a VPN Service Point, whereupon the Service 
Point establishes a connection, via the public telephone network, between the user local 

exchange and the destination PBX. 
A telecommunications system as claimed in Claim 2, wherein a message is sent 
from the initiating PBX to the destination PBX via the I.N. message network, the 

message including a message identifier, the called extension number and a call-label to 
identify any subsequent messages sent via the message network relating to the call. 
A system as claimed in Claim 3, wherein the number dialled by the initiating PBX 
to the local exchange comprises a VPN Service Code, a message identifier and the called 

extension number. 
A system as claimed in Claim 4, wherein the local exchange sends a message via 
the I.N. Service Router to a VPN Service Point which message comprises the user's 

 
Calling Line Identity (CLI), the local exchange call reference, the VPN Service Request, 

the number dialled by the user and the message identifier received from the user's PBX. 
A system as claimed in Claim 3, 4 or 5, wherein the connection between the VPN 
Service Point and the user local exchange is made using an I.N. override facility.
