<ABSTRACT>
Provided herein are: a modified human granulocyte 
macrophage-colony stimulating factor("hGM-CSF") gene useful 

for the mass production of hGM-CSF in yeast, an expression 
vector containing said gene, a yeast cell transformed with 

said expression vector and a process for producing hGM-CSF by 
employing the yeast cell. The modified hGM-CSF gene possesses 

yeast preferred codons and is able to inactivate two N-linked 
glycosylation recognition sites present in native GM-CSF.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a modified human
granulocyte macrophage-colony stimulating factor("hGM-CSF")
gene and an expression thereof; and, more specifically,
relates to a modified hGM-CSF gene useful for the mass
production of hGM-CSF in yeast, an expression vector
containing said gene, a yeast cell transformed with said
expression vector and a process for producing said hGM-CSF by
employing yeast cells.Colony stimulating factor("CSF") refers to a family of
lymphokines which induce progenitor cells to differentiate
specific types of mature blood cells. A particuler type of
mature blood cell that results from a progenitor cell depends
upon the type of CSF present. Known types of CSF include G-CSF(Nicola
etal., J. Biol. Chem. 258, 9017-9021(1983), M-CSF(Standley
etal., J. Biol. Chem. 252, 4045-4052(1977), GM-CSF(Burgess
etal., J. Biol. Chem. 252, 1991-2033(1977)) and
multi-CSF(Burgess etal., Biochem. J. 185, 341-343(1980)).The GM-CSF, which stimulates the formation of 
granulocyte-macrophage colony, is known to be produced in
various cells such as epithelial cell, macrophage and
lymphocyte and useful for the induction of hematopoietic
cell's regeneration, and the treatment of exogenous infection
and myeloid leukemia.In 1985, cDNA clones encoding hGM-CSF were obtained by
way of selecting them from the total cDNA clones prepared from
the mRNA isolated from HUT-102 animal cells and T-lymphocyte
cells by employing murine GM-CSF cDNA(Michael etal., P.N.A.S.
82, 6250-6254(1984)); and they were expressed to secrete hGM-CSF
from a yeast cell by employing a yeast expression system
containing an alpha factor promoter and an alpha factor leader
sequence.Meanwhile, Nicholas etal. and Gordon etal. have
publiched respectively their expression results of a hGM-CSF
gene in a COS-1 animal cell (Nicholas etal., EMBO 4, 645-653(1985);
and Gordon etal., Science 228, 810-815(1985)).On the other hand, GM-CSF includes two N-linked
glycosylation recognition sites, i.e., asparagine-X-serine and
asparagine-X-threonine(Asn-X-Ser and Asn-X-Thr, wherein X is
any amino acid); and, therefore, is produced in a glycosylated
form in an animal cell or yeast cell with a molecular weight
ranging from 35 to 100Kd due to heterogenous N-glycosylation
(Joachim etal., Bio/Technology 5, 831-834(1987)).
Accordingly, it is difficult to purify the glycosylated GM-CSF
produced in an animal or yeast cell in a high purity; and, 
therefore, the yield is poor.In addition, it has been reported that a murine GM-CSF
gene which has a nucleotide
