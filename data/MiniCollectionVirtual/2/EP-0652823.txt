<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an improved 
process for making silicone hydrogel lenses. Hydrogels represent a desirable class of 
materials for contact lenses. A hydrogel is a 
hydrated cross-linked polymeric system that contains 
water in an equilibrium state. Hydrogel lenses 
offer relatively high oxygen permeability as well as 
desirable biocompatibility and comfort. Conventional hydrogel lenses are prepared from 
monomeric mixtures predominantly containing 
hydrophilic monomers such as 2-hydroxyethyl 
methacrylate or N-vinyl pyrrolidone. Oxygen 
permeability of these conventional hydrogel 
materials relates to the water content of the 
materials. More recently, it has been desired to 
increase the oxygen permeability of hydrogel lenses 
by employing silicone-containing monomers in the 
hydrogel formulations since silicone based materials 
have higher oxygen permeability than water. 
Silicone hydrogels (i.e., hydrogels containing 
silicone) are usually prepared by polymerizing a 
mixture containing at least one silicone-containing 
monomer and at least one hydrophilic monomer. 
Either the silicone-containing monomer or the 
hydrophilic monomer may function as a crosslinking 
agent (a crosslinker being defined as a monomer 
having multiple polymerizable functionalities) or a 
separate crosslinker may be employed.  
 Various processes are known for curing a 
monomeric mixture in the production of contact 
lenses, including spincasting and static casting. 
Spincasting methods are disclosed in U.S. Patent 
Nos. 3,408,429 and 3,660,545, and static casting 
methods are disclosed in U.S. Patent Nos. 4,113,224 
and 4,197,266. Curing of the monomeric mixture is 
often followed by a machining operation in order to 
provide a contact lens having a desired final 
configuration. According to several known techniques for 
manufacturing contact lenses, the casting process 
may yield a shaped article having the desired 
posterior and anterior lens surfaces. For example, 
in static casting processes, a monomeric mixture can 
be charged to a mold comprising a first mold section 
including a surface for forming a desired anterior 
lens surface and a second mold section including a 
surface for forming a desired posterior lens 
surface. In spincasting processes, the monomeric 
mixture can be charged to an open mold having a 
surface for forming a desired anterior lens surface, 
and a desired posterior lens surface is formed from 
rotation of the mold. However, machining 
operations, subsequent to the curing of the
