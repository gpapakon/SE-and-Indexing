<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a tool for creating a wrapped wire electrical connection. 
More particularly, the present invention relates to an electrically powered tool for wrapping a 
wire around a post, said tool being shielded to prevent transmission of electromagnetic 
interference from the tool to nearby electrical equipment and components. In the assembly of devices such as printed circuit boards, it is common to make electrical 
connections in situ. Such connections are often made by means of soldering, but may also be 
made by means of wire wrapping. Wire wrapping entails passing one end of a wire several 
times closely and tightly around a post, such that a good electrical connection is made. If the 
wire is insulated, a section of insulation adjacent the wire end must be removed to allow 
electrical contact. Power tools have been developed to complete wire-wrapped connections in 
a quick and consistent manner. Such tools are commonly referred to as wire-wrap tools. One 
type of wire-wrap tool resembles an electric drill and includes a driving end comprising a 
collet, which receives a bit having two apertures therein. One of the apertures is 
centered on the axis of the bit while the other is offset radially from the axis. To operate such 
a tool, the wire end to be connected is threaded into the offset aperture and the center aperture 
is then placed over the post to which the wire is to be connected. When the tool is operated, 
the bit spins, causing the wire to be wrapped tightly around the post. The wire is drawn 
outwardly through the bit as it wraps around the post until the wire end is completely wrapped. Heretofore, it was common for the individual components of the materials being worked, 
such as printed circuit boards, to be themselves shielded or protected from electromagnetic  
 
interference. Cost considerations, however, have recently led to the creation of several such 
circuits that lack adequate shielding of their individual components. Such circuit boards may 
be enclosed in a shield which protect the entire board, but such shielding is inadequate when it 
becomes necessary to directly access individual components the board, such as in the instance 
of repairs or alterations. In those instances, the electromagnetic interference generated by the 
power tools used to perform the repairs, such as wire wrap tools, can cause damage or 
interruptions to the system in which the board is integrated. Hence, it is desired to provide a 
tool for completing wire wrap connections
