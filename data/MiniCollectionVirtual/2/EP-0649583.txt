<ABSTRACT>
A method for interfacing an incoming data stream with an asynchronous transfer mode (ATM) switch core, comprises packetizing the incoming data stream into data packets having header and data sections; converting original information in the header section into a logical switch connection number (SCN) and immediately before application of a packet to the ATM switch core converting the logical SCN into physical routing information for routing the packet between selected input and output ports of the ATM switch core, thereby adapting the physical routing information to momentarily available routes between input and output ports of the switch core.

<DESCRIPTION>
This application pertains to subject matter 
included in U.S. Patent Application Serial No. 638,872, 
titled "Common Memory Switch For Routing Data Signals" 
filed by E.A. Munter on January 11, 1991, 
published as US-A-5 144 619 on 01.09.92. This invention relates to packet switching in 
general and particularly to a method and apparatus for 
switch partitioning. More specifically, this invention 
relates to a method and apparatus for switch 
partitioning which minimizes the functionality of an 
asynchronous transfer mode (ATM) cross point matrix to 
that strictly necessary at the centre of the switch. In a paper titled "Architectual And Functional 
Aspects Of A Multi-Media Packet Switched Network" by  
 
Takami K., et al. Proc. ISS, 1987, the authors discuss 
a network architecture based upon the core and edge 
concept, in which the core of the switch offers common 
functions to all media, while the edge offers media 
dependent functions. The paper discusses a layered 
structure of functions for the entire network. And 
while "core interface" (CI) between the edge and the 
core is described as using only packet transmission 
functions, the structure of the CI itself is not 
discussed in this paper. In another paper titled "Wideband Packet Technology 
For Switching Systems" by Luderer, G.W.R., et al, Proc. 
ISS, 1987, the authors state: 
   The network hardware can support virtual 
circuits as well as datagram type services. For 
the virtual circuits, a logical Channel Number 
(LCN) is used to represent a destination. To 
create a new virtual circuit between two AIs [AI: 
Access Interface], it is necessary to assign LCNs 
for all links that are used for routing packets for 
that virtual circuit. The LCN assignments are done 
by the call processors at the time of call setup.  
 
A packet that enters a switch with an LCN number 
LCN_in leaves the switch with a translated LCN 
number LCN_out. The LCN translation is done in the 
trunk controllers by a simple table look-up 
procedure. The call processor is responsible for 
updating the translation tables in the trunk 
controllers. One virtual circuit may pass through 
several switches and transmission facilities; a 
packet originating at an AI may therefore use 
different LCNs along different links that form the 
path from the source to the destination. A 16-bit 
LCN field supports 65536 virtual circuits per 
switch; a network of several switches can therefore 
support a very large number of virtual circuits. 
It is also possible to implement many other

A method for interfacing an incoming data stream with 
an asynchronous transfer mode (ATM) switch core, 

comprising: packetizing the incoming data stream into data 
packets having header (15) and data sections (16); 

converting original information in said header section 
into a logical switch connection number (SCN) and 

immediately before application of a packet to the ATM 
switch core converting said logical SCN into physical 

routing information for routing said packet between 
selected input and output ports of said ATM switch core, 

thereby adapting said physical routing information to 
momentarily available routes between input and output 

ports of said switch core. 
A method for interfacing an incoming data stream with 
an ATM switch core as defined in claim 1, wherein the step 

of converting said logical SCN into said physical routing 
information is accomplished by translating a header 

containing said logical SCN into a physical header 
containing said momentarily available routes between pairs 

of said selected input and output ports of said switch 
core. 
A method for interfacing an incoming data stream with 
an ATM switch core as defined in claim 2, wherein said 

physical header momentarily controls routing between input 
and output ports of said switch core. 
A method for interfacing an incoming data stream with 
an ATM switch core as defined in claim 2 or claim 3, 

wherein said physical header is itself routed between 
input and output ports of said switch core.
