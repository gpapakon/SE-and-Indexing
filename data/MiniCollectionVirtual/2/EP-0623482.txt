<CLAIMS>
A rim having rim discs (11, 12) made of sheet metal 
securely connected to one another, having a radial outer 

rim base and a central bearing seat,
characterised in that
 in the bearing seat (14) a contact 
ring (15-17) in the form of a bearing cup boss made of 

actual sheet of one of the rim discs radially inwardly 
extends, against which a two-part hub bearing member (23, 

30, 41-43, 46) forming bearing faces of a hub or axle 
lies. 
A rim according to Claim 1,
characterised in that
 the bearing seats are formed lying 
towards the rim centre.

characterised in that
 the hub bearing member (23, 30, 41-43, 
46) consists of two parts with a mirror-inverted 

construction. 
A rim according to Claim 1 or 2,
characterised in that
 the hub bearing member is formed 
from two asymmetrical individual parts (30, 31). 
A rim according to one of Claims 1 to 4,
characterised in that
 the hub bearing member (23, 30, 41-43, 
46) is constructed to receive differently shaped 

hubs, axles or the like. 
A rim according to one of Claims 1 to 5,
characterised in that
 the hub bearing member is equipped 
with annular chambers (27).  

 
A rim according to one of Claims 1 to 6,
characterised in that
 the hub bearing member has a 
round, hexagonal or octagonal construction and is 

equipped with radial ribs (19). 
A rim according to one of Claims 6 or 7,
characterised in that
 each annular chamber (27) is 
open to the contact ring (14). 
A rim according to one of Claims 1 to 8,
characterised in that
 the hub bearing member (24) is 
constructed with outwardly protruding annular rings 

(25), which abut the adjacent rim base.

characterised in that
 the hub bearing member (24) is 
equipped with inner sealing rings (29). 
A rim according to one of Claims 1 to 10,
characterised in that
 the rim discs (11, 12) are 
securely connected to one another by means of beads

characterised in that
 the rim discs (120, 121) have 
further recesses (125), the edge regions of which 

are connected to one another by beaded edges (126). 
A rim according to Claim 12,
characterised in that
 recesses (125) associated with 
one another are constructed with different 

diameters,
and in that
 the edge region of the smaller recess 
forms the beaded edge.
