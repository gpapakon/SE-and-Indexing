<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a method for optimising frequency-modulated rasters for recording black/white or coloured screen images. The image to be recorded in each case is optoelectronically scanned and digitally stored in the form of the individual grey scale values which had been allocated to the individual pixels. Using the grey scale values, threshold decisions are made in which it is decided whether a pixel is set or not in the raster recording of the image.

A method for optimizing, frequency-modulated screens for the recording of
black/white or coloured screen images, the image which is to be recorded

respectively being scanned optoelectronically by image point and stored digitally in
an image point memory in the form of grey values associated with the individual

image points, and threshold value decisions being carried out by means of the grey
values, by means of which a decision is made as to whether or not a pixel is set in

the recording of the image and for the threshold value decision a two-dimensional
threshold value memory being used, which is superimposed on the image point

memory in two-dimensional periodic repetition to carry out the threshold value
decisions, and the threshold values of which are selected so that they form a

topography within the threshold value memory (in a third dimension), i.e. form one
or more threshold value ranges, the expansion of the threshold value memory

being selected greater in one dimension than in the other dimension, characterised
in that


a) with the two-dimensional periodic repetition of the threshold value memory
in one dimension of the repetition, one operates with a shift,
b) the expansion of the threshold value memory is selected so that it can be
divided into quadratic sub-memories which together form the entire threshold value

memory,
c) from each sub-memory an element is randomly selected and a continuous
ordinal number is allocated to this element,
d) each sub-memory is further subdivided by continuous quadripartition and in
so doing randomly selected elements in the quadrants are allocated ordinal

numbers and 
e) threshold values are allocated to the elements in accordance with the
ordinal numbers.
The method according to Claim 1, characterised in that it is carried out with
a constant shift.
The method according to Claim 1, characterised in that it is carried out with
a variable shift which is determined by a random number which is to be

determined again and again.
The method according to one of Claims 1 to 3, characterised in that

a) the sub-memories are constructed as sub-quadrants which are formed from
elements arranged in rows and
b) the filling of the elements of the sub-quadrants takes place by continuous
quadripartition of the threshold value range and by random determining of the

elements in the sub-quadrants,
The method according to Claim 4, characterised in that

a) the first element of a row is selected from the threshold value range by
means of a random generator and it is allocated the number 0,
b) the threshold value range is divided into four quadrants of the first order,
and in the quadrant of the first order, which lies opposite the quadrant of the first

order, which the first element is situated, the second element of the row is
determined and it is allocated the ordinal number 1 (Fig. 11), 
c) with the two remaining quadrants of the first order, through placing the
ordinal numbers 2 and 3, one proceeds as with the first two quadrants of the first

order (Fig. 12),
d) the four quadrants of the first order are divided into four groups of four
quadrants of the second order (Fig. 12), the set four ordinal numbers respectively

falling each into one quadrant of the second order within one of the four groups,
e) the ordinal numbers 4 to 7 are respectively set to a group of four quadrants
within the quadrants of the second order, the ordinal number being allocated to the

quadrant which ties opposite the quadrant which already contains one of the
ordinal numbers 1 to 3 (Fig. 12),
f) in two further passes respectively one quadrant of each group is covered
with a further ordinal number (Fig. 13), until all the quadrants of the second order

are covered with an ordinal number,
g) four groups of quadrants of the third order are formed in succession, in
which firstly one of the four groups is formed (Fig. 14) and four ordinal numbers are

set, then a further group is formed diagonal to the first group, which further group is
likewise covered with four ordinal numbers (Fig. 15) and then a third and fourth

group are formed, which are likewise respectively covered with four ordinal
numbers,
h) the procedure according to feature g) is repeated twice (Fig. 16), 
i) a renewed working twice of the four groups of four quadrant groups
of the third order takes place, in which an ordinal number is allocated to each of

these quadrants (Fig. 17) and
j) threshold values are allocated to the elements according to the ordinal

numbers.
The method according to Claim 5, characterized in that in the case where
the quadrants only still consist of one element, the setting of the ordinal numbers

does not take place into the opposite element but into any desired element.
The method according to Claim 5, characterized in that on reaching the
quadrant of the last order, only two ordinal numbers are set per quadrant.
The method according to one of Claims I to 7, characterized in that the
dimensions of the threshold value range are selected such that their height is a

power of two and their width is a multiple of the height and that they are filled with a
plurality of quadratic basic forms.
