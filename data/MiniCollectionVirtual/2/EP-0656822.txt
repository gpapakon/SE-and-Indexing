<ABSTRACT>
A coated abrasive article comprising (a) a porous backing having a front side and a back side; (b) in direct contact with the porous backing, a make coat formed from a composition comprising a radiation curable adhesive applied over the front side of the backing; (c) a multiplicity of abrasive grits bonded by the make coat to the front side of the backing; and (d) a size coat overlying both the abrasive grits and the make coat. The invention also involves several methods for preparing the coated abrasive article. In all of these methods, a radiation curable make coat precursor is applied directly to the front side of the porous backing. No treatment coat is required to seal the backing prior to application of the make coat precursor.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a coated abrasive
article and to a method of making such an article.Coated abrasive articles generally comprise a
flexible backing to which is adhered a coating of
abrasive grits. The coated abrasive article typically
employs a "make coat" of resinous adhesive material in
order to secure or bond the abrasive grits to the
backing and a "size coat" of resinous material applied
over the make coat and abrasive grits in order to
firmly bond the abrasive grits to the backing.The flexible backing can be made of cloth,
paper, polymeric film, nonwoven materials, vulcanized
fiber, and combinations thereof. Cloth is widely used
as a coated abrasive backing on account of its
strength, heat resistance, and flexibility. However,
cloth backings have some major disadvantages. Cloth
backings are generally more expensive than other types
of backings. Additionally, because cloth backings are
generally porous, they have to be sealed or treated,
thereby significantly adding to their cost. If the
cloth backing is not sealed, the make coat will
penetrate into the interstices of the cloth, resulting
in a deficiency of binder, and the subsequently applied
abrasive grits will not adhere to the backing. The
cloth backing is typically sealed by one or more
treatment coats, such as a saturant coat, a presize
coat, a backsize coat, or a subsize coat. A saturant
coat saturates the cloth, resulting in a stiffer cloth
with more body. An increase in body provides an 
increase in strength and durability of the article. A
presize coat, which is applied to the front side of the
backing, may add bulk to the cloth or may improve
adhesion of subsequent coatings. A presize coat also
protects the yarns of the cloth. A presize coat is
extremely useful for coated abrasive articles utilizing
fine grades of abrasive grits. A backsize coat, which
is applied to the back side of the backing, i.e., the
side opposite to which the abrasive grits are applied,
adds body to the backing and protects the yarns of the
cloth from wear. A subsize coat is similar to a
saturation coat except that it is applied to a
previously treated backing.These treatment coats typically comprise
thermally curable resinous adhesives, such as phenolic
resins, epoxy resins, acrylate resins, acrylic latices,
latices, urethane resins, glue, starch and combinations
thereof.U.S. Patent No. 2,712,987 discloses a coated
abrasive having a nylon substrate. The nylon is
softened and then the abrasive grits are applied. The
nylon serves both as the backing and as

<CLAIMS>
A coated abrasive article comprising a
porous backing having a front side and a back side,

said front side having directly adhered thereto a make
coat formed from a radiation curable adhesive, a

multiplicity of abrasive grits bonded by said make coat
to the front side of said backing, and a size coat

overlying said abrasive grits and said make coat wherein no
intermediate treatment coat is between the make coat and the

front side of the porous backing.
A method of making a coated abrasive
article according to claim 1 comprising the steps of:


a. providing a porous backing having a
front side and a back side;
b. applying a radiation curable make coat
precursor to the front side of said backing so that

said make coat precursor is in direct contact with said
backing;
c. applying a multiplicity of abrasive
grits into said make coat precursor;
d. exposing said make coat precursor to a
source of radiation energy to at least partially cure

said make coat precursor, whereby the make coat
precursor seals the backing and serves to bond the

abrasive grits to the backing;
e. applying a size coat precursor over said
abrasive grits; and
f. completely curing said make coat and
said size coat precursors.
