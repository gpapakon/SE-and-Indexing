forming stable films which have excellent protective properties, especially on 

metallic substrates, good chemical resistance and/or permeability to water 
vapor, comprising particles suspended in an aqueous solution made by 

interpolymerizing an acrylic latex seed particle with a vinylidene chloride 
polymer comprising vinylidene chloride, one or more alkyl acrylates having 

from 1 to 18 carbon atoms in the alkyl group and/or one or more alkyl 
methacrylates having 1 to 18 carbon atoms in the alkyl group, one 
or more 
aliphatic alpha-beta-unsaturated carboxylic acids, and a copolymerizable 

surface active agent, the proportion of vinylidene chloride being 65 to 90 
parts by weight, the portion of said alkyl acrylates and/or methacrylates being 

from 2 to 30 parts by weights, the portion of said carboxylic acids being from

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to an improved surface coating composition
capable of forming stable films having excellent protective properties,
especially on metallic substrates. In particular the present invention is
directed to an improved vinylidene chloride interpolymer latex for use as a
metal coating.The use of vinylidene chloride polymers as coatings is known. For
example, U.S.-A-4,341,679 and 4,435,478 disclose coatings for
metallic substrates where the polymer consists essentially of vinylidene
chloride, vinyl chloride, an alkyl acrylate or methacrylate, and an unsaturated
carboxylic acid. U.S.-A-4,945,134 and 5,039,751 disclose vinylidene
chloride copolymers having barrier properties for use as a coating on polymer
films which comprise vinylidene chloride monomers as a first phase
interpolymerized with ethylenically unsaturated monomers, such as alkyl
acrylates or methacrylates, or acrylic or methacrylic acid as a second phase.
U.S. -A-3,291,769 teaches a process for manufacturing polyvinylidene
chloride emulsions used as barrier coatings on paper and films. U.S.-A-
3,787,232 discloses vinylidene chloride polymers capable of being cured
at low temperatures for use as coatings for fibrous materials, where the
vinylidene chloride is copolymerized with carboxylic monomers and N-alkylol
amide. U.S. -A-4,058,649 teaches a coating composition for coating
thermoplastic film substrates, such a biaxially oriented polypropylene film
substrate, which is heat sealable and which is an interpolymer of methacrylic
acid and mixtures with acrylic acid, an alkyl acrylate, and vinylidene chloride.Overpolymer compositions comprised of vinylidene chloride
copolymers polymerized as layers over a core material are known for use as
paper wraps, coated food films or containers. Examples of vinylidene
chloride overpolymers are U.S. -A-3,291,768; 3,309,330; 3,379,665;
4,307,006; 4,898,782; 4,965,130; and 4,997,859. Most of these use a vinylidene 
chloride core or seed for the overpolymerization. In the case of U.S. -A-4,898,782;
4,965,130; and 4,997,859, the core layer is a copolymer of a
methacrylate and an acrylate ester, because it imparts to the coated films the
properties of high heat-seal strength, and the core seed particles are made by
the extrusion polymerization of the two monomers.Intertwined polymer networks in which a first polymer network is
intertwined on a molecular scale with a second polymer network are known,
such as is disclosed in U.S. -A-5,169,884 to M.K. Lindemann et al.
The disclosed polymer is useful
