<ABSTRACT>
A rotation rate sensor which employs a built-in (i.e. 
internal) test circuit. The rotation rate sensor includes 

a piezoelectric structure. Deposited on the piezoelectric 
structure are at least two pickup high and two pickup low 

electrodes. A pickup circuit is coupled to the pickup high 
and pickup low electrodes. During a normal mode of operation, 

the piezoelectric structure is subject to a rotation about 
one of its axis. In response, the pickup circuit generates 

a rate signal which corresponds to the rotation rate of the 
piezoelectric structure. The test circuit is coupled to the 

pickup low electrodes. During a test mode of operation, the 
piezoelectric structure is also subject to a rotation about 

the axis. But, the test circuit generates at the same time 
a test signal which is provided to the pickup low electrodes 

and which corresponds to a pseudo rate of rotation. In 
response, the pickup circuit generates a rate signal which 

corresponds to the sum of the actual rate of rotation of the 
piezoelectric material plus the pseudo rate of rotation.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates generally to the testing of
vibration type piezoelectric rotation rate sensors. In particular, it pertains to a test
circuit built into such a rotation rate sensor.The present application is also related to the copending,
concurrently filed, and commonly assigned U.S. Patent
Application entitled "Rotation Rate Sensor with Center
Mounted Tuning Fork", Ser. No. 08/100.760 , by P. Gupta and
C. Jenson. This application is expressly incorporated herein.It is known to provide acceleration sensors with an
integrated test circuit. For example, EP-A-0,534,366
describes an acceleration sensor comprising a
piezoelectric element outputting an electric signal
corresponding to acceleration applied, signal processing
means for processing a signal outputted from the
piezoelectric element, AC signal outputting means for
generating an AC signal. The AC signal is synchronized
with the period of a timing signal which is externally
inputted. A capacitor is connected between the AC signal
outputting means and the piezoelectric element.
Similarly EP-A-0,525,549 describes an acceleration sensor
device suitable for self-checking during vehicle driving
and a self-checking circuit. The acceleration sensor
device comprises a planar vibrator consisting of a
piezoelectric area having piezoelectricity and a non-piezoelectric
area having no piezoelectricity. A
plurality of first electrodes are provided on an upper
face of the piezoelectric area of the planar vibrator,
while at least one second electrode is provided on an
upper face of the non-piezoelectric area of the planar
vibrator. A third electrode means is provided on a lower
face of the planar vibrator. Vibration type piezoelectric, sensors are also known.
For example, US-A-4,930,351 describes an inertial sensing
system which includes a geometric structure having
several independent mechanically resonant modes of
vibration such that when the structure is subjected to
outside inertial motions that are to be sensed, a driven
mode of vibration will couple energy in a specific manner
into a pickup mode. The driven mode serves as a
reference motion. The system measures angular rotation
rate by sensing the vibrations in the pickup mode caused
by the action of the Coriolis effect on the balanced
driven mode which couples energy into the pickup mode.Current approaches for testing rotation rate sensors rely
on testers which are externally hooked up to the rotation
rate sensor by the manufacturer. However, these testers are
complex, costly, and are used only
