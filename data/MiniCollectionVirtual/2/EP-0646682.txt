<ABSTRACT>
The efficiency of energy conversion is enhanced by taking a countermeasure against heat escape (radiation), 
the water sealability is enhanced between the solar battery modules, and the voltage required is obtained by one roof 

panel to make it possible to supply power efficiently. A roof Y installed with solar batteries is formed by supporting 
the solar battery modules (3) by core woods (6) and frames (11) on a base panel (2). The heat of the solar batteries is 

dissipated by the air flow through the ventilating layers (1A) formed between the modules (3) and the base panel (2). 
The modules (3) are fitted through sealing materials (12) and (14) into the C-shaped parts (13 and 15) of the frames 

in order to ensure the waterproofness. Also, a frame (32) is used around each module (3), and the extended piece (39) 
of each frame (32) on the eaves side is overlaid on each other to prevent rainwater from entering the spaces between 

them. In one roof panel (1), a specific number of solar cells (10) are arranged to produce a required voltage. Thus by 
adjusting the voltage, any excessive or short supply of power does not occur.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a roof with solar battery and is expected to be used as a roof of house. There are provided solar batteries in each roof to generate electric energy consumed in the house.There has been put solar batteries into practice to supply an electric power into an house as one building structure of which roof having the solar batteries to save consumption of energy.The frame fixing method in which the panel solar battery unit is secured on the established roof with a dedication frame, when the solar batteries are installed on the roof, is generally known. It has also been known in the art that the so-called solar battery roofing tiles with built-in solar batteries on the roofing tile are arranged on the roof panel.There are, however, the following defects for the frame fixing method.First of all, a separate process is inevitable for frame anchoring, and roofing material of roofing tile, roofing board and common rafter are damaged, whereas it is difficult to obtain watertight type and durability.In addition, an electrical wire of solar battery exposed into exterior is apt to be influenced by the immediate wind, rain and the sun light.On the other hand, there are the following defects for the solar battery roofing tile.An electric connector prepared at a joint part of the roofing tiles may be damaged by the rain-water.As one of modem installation method to arrange solar batteries on the roof, a roofing technique, in which plural roof panels consisting of the roof panel defining a roof and plural solar battery modules in an associated state, has been developed.The mentioned roof with solar battery provided with the solar battery module allows the installation of the solar battery at the same time of laying the roof and the avoidance of the exposure of the electric wiring and the leak of the rain-water and it gets rid of the defect in the mentioned conventional solar battery installation.The solar battery module attached to each roof panel with solar battery is formed with many solar battery cells (solar battery elements) on the surface in a general rectangular thin panel state. Its dimensions is established for fitting into external dimensions of the roof panel on which solar battery modules are arranged along its length and width.The voltage fitting to the number of the solar battery modules can be acquired from the roof panel with solar battery equipped with plural solar battery modules.Namely, it is general that a solar battery module contains the designated output voltage according to
