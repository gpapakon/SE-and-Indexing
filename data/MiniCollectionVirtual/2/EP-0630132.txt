<ABSTRACT>
In a simultaneous voice and data communications system, a voice signal 
is mapped into an N-dimensional signal space constellation as a vector, and added to 

a reference signal point, i.e., a data symbol, where the data symbol is selected from a 
constellation of data symbols every signaling interval as a function of a data signal. 

The constellation signal space is further divided into a number of shaped regions, 
where each region is associated with a different one of the data symbols. The shape 

of each region is selected as a function of the characteristics of the voice, or audio, 
signal. In particular, each region illustratively has a rectangular shape.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to data communications equipment, e.g., 
modems. In particular, this invention relates to the transmission of both voice and 
data signals over the same communications facility at the same time. The co-pending, commonly assigned, U.S. Patent application of Gordon 
Bremer and Kenneth D. Ko entitled "Simultaneous Analog and Digital 
Communication," Serial No. 076505, filed on June 14, 1993, discloses a 
simultaneous voice and data communication system in which a voice signal is added 
to a data signal for transmission over a communications channel to a receiving 
modem. In particular, the data signal to be transmitted is represented by a sequence 
of data symbols, where each data symbol is associated with a particular N-dimensional 
signal point value take from a signal space. Similarly, the voice signal 
is processed so that it is mapped into the N-dimensional signal space to provide a 
voice signal point. This voice signal point defines the magnitude and angle of a 
voice signal vector about the origin of the signal point constellation. The data 
symbol and the voice signal vector are then added together to select a resultant N-dimensional 
signal point. Since this resultant N-dimensional signal point is a function of both the 
particular data symbol and the magnitude and phase of the voice signal vector, the 
signal space is essentially divided into a number of square non-overlapping regions, 
each region comprising a number of signal point values with one signal point value 
being associated with a data symbol. Consequently, any signal point value within a 
square region may be validly selected for transmission to a receiving modem. Since 
each signal point region is non-overlapping, the size of each region is fixed. This 
results in limiting the magnitude, or dynamic range, of the voice signal vector so that 
the resultant signal point always lies within a region. The dynamic range of the 
voice signal vector is directly related to the transmission quality of the voice signal. Typically the overall size of the signal space is constrained by power 
limitations. As a result, the modem's data rate and quality of voice transmission are 
interrelated. For example, for higher voice quality, the signal space is divided into a 
smaller number of larger size square regions. Each square region is associated with 
a data symbol and the data rate is directly proportional to the number of data 
symbols available for transmission. Since there are fewer, but larger, square regions, 
the
