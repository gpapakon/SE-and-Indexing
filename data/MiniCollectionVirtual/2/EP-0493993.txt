<ABSTRACT>
Device intended for viewing three-dimensional television transmissions, or three-dimensional video recordings which are available in video cassette form, the objective being to compensate the flattening and apparent reduction in the size of the image through a smaller screen, or enlargement and stretching through a screen larger than the standard screen for which the programmes were made. The two views, left and right, are offset by delaying either the line synchronisation, or the video signal, by means of a delay circuit (1) and, moreover, the signal is held at its blanking level by means of a freeze circuit (2) for a period defined by a clock circuit (3). The invention can be applied to a television which may or may not be equipped to receive three-dimensional programmes, or to an accessory external to the television, connected into its antenna circuit or through its television peripheral socket.

Device for processing three-dimensional 
video image signals, comprising means of the frame 

parity counting type (5) for classifying the 
frames in two categories corresponding, 

respectively, to spatially different shots, 
characterised in that it comprises: 


a clock circuit (3) defining a correction time, 
known as a "time shift", of between 0.5 and 6 

microseconds, and selected on the basis of a 
correction value corresponding to a relative 

displacement between the images of the one and the 
other category, and 
correction means (1, 2, 12, 14) which are 
capable of producing, for at least one of the 

frame categories, a relative shift between the 
portion of the video signal that can be visualised 

and the line sweep operation, so that the relative 
displacement between the images of the one and the 

other category corresponds to the said correction 
value, and which are also capable, for all the 

frames, of forcing the video signal to a non-visible 
auxiliary level, at at least one end of 

the useful portion of the video signal, for a  
 

period substantially equal to the time shift 
associated with the correction value. 
Device according to Claim 1,
 
characterised in that the correction means, which 

act after the line sweep synchronisation signal 
has been separated from the video signal, 

comprise: 

shifting means (1, 12), for one of the 
frame categories, between the line sweep 

synchronisation signal and the video 
signal; and 
blocking means (2) which, for all the 
frames, extend the period of 

extinguishment on the line sweep return 
by a time interval defined by the clock 

circuit (3). 
Device according to Claim 2,
 
characterised in that the shifting means comprise 

a circuit (1) for retarding the line sweep 
synchronisation signal, and in that the blocking 

means (2) extend the period of extinguishment on 
the downstream line sweep return, for the 

beginning of the portion of the video signals that 
can be visualised.  

 
Device according to Claim 2,
 
characterised in that the shifting means comprise 

a circuit (12) for retarding the video signal to 
be visualised, and in that the blocking means (2) 

extend the period of extinguishment on the 
upstream line sweep return, for the end of the 

portion of the video signals that can be 
visualised. 
Device according to Claim 1,
 
characterised in that the correction means, which 

act before the line sweep synchronisation signal 
has been separated from the video signal, comprise 

a switching circuit (14) which has two inputs 
which receive, respectively, the video signal and 

an auxiliary signal of a sufficiently low level 
for the image to be seen in black but sufficiently 

high not to trigger line synchronisation, and 
which is connected to the classification means (5) 

and also to the clock circuit (3), the switching 
circuit (14) substituting the auxiliary signal for 

the video signal for the period defined by the 
clock circuit (3), on the one hand for a category 

of frames at the end of the useful portion of the 
video signal and on the other hand for all the 

frames at the beginning of the useful portion of 
the video signal.
