<ABSTRACT>
A navigation aid for use with printed maps, the aid comprising: (a) a receiver of transmitted signals from a geographic position fixing system such as, for example, GPS, which receiver is operative to determine from the transmitted signals the current geographic coordinates of the navigation aid; (b) an electronic database means storing a plurality of sets of data, each set of data comprising definitive parameters of a respective map or series of maps for definition of the correspondence between the coordinates of the map grid associated with the map and the coordinates of the geographic position fixing system; (c) a map identity input means for the user to enter into the aid the identity of the map to be used therewith and data selection means responsive to the input identity to select from the database the set of data corresponding to the map identified by the user; (d) processing means for converting the currently determined geographic coordinates into the corresponding map grid coordinates of the identified map using the selected data; and (e) a display for displaying the thus-established corresponding map grip coordinates to the user.

<DESCRIPTION>
 NAVIGATION AID Technical fieldThe present invention relates to a Navigation aidBackgroundSince the 1930s various signal transmitting techniques have been developed for the purpose of enabling the precise location of ships, planes, vehicles and other objects to be determinedInitially, these were land based systems such as GEE, OBOE, DECCA, LORAN,PULSE-8 and OMEGA which provided the means for the location of a ship or aircraft on the Earth's surface to be determined to various degrees of precision and position update ratesThe years since the early 1980's have witnessed the arrival of satellite-based position fixing systems Initially there was the TRANSIT system, subsequently the American GPS (Global Positioning System) and Russian GLONAS systems have been introduced Now, the most widely used system is GPS, with the LORAN-C and CHAYKA (the Russian equivalent of LORAN-C system) increasingly becoming accepted as the backup systems.In view of its capability for precise measurement of position, applications for GPS vary widely At one end of the scale the level of accuracy of sophisticated receivers combined with accuracy-enhancement techniques permits GPS to measure the movement of the Earth s surface and movement within large structures such as suspension bridges At the other end of the scale low cost, hand-held GPS units enable 

the location of users to be determined to an accuracy of approximately 100 metres Many types of GPS receiver are available but the type of GPS receiver used in the greatest numbers is probably the hand-held receiver which is used extensively for marine navigationEssentially, a position fixing device contains two elements the position-determining sensor which determines location, and the processing and time measurement element which analyses information provided by the position-determining sensor and provides position and time-derived information such as speed, direction of travel, bearing, time and distance to destination, estimated time of arrival and off-track errorOne of the areas where GPS and LORAN-C are most highly valued is marine navigation where the means to accurately determine a vessel's location has contributed significantly to safe navigation.For land applications, navigation systems tend to be less widely used, not least because of the difficulties associated with presenting position-related information A mariner presented with a position in geographic co-ordinates normally has the means (in the form of parallel rulers, dividers, a latitude and longitude annotated

CLAIMS
1. A navigation aid for use with printed maps, the aid comprising:
(a) a receiver of transmitted signals from a geographic position fixing system such as, for example, GPS;, which receiver is operative to determine from the transmitted signals the current geographic co-ordinates of the navigation aid;
(b) an electronic database means storing a plurality of sets of data, each set of data comprising definitive parameters of a respective map or series of maps for definition of the correspondence between the coordinates of the map grid associated with the map and the coordinates of the geographic position fixing system;
(c) a map identity input means for the user to enter into the aid the identity of the map to be used therewith and data selection means responsive to the input identity to select from the database the set of data corresponding to the map identified by the user; (d) processing means for converting the currently determined geographic coordinates into the corresponding map grid co-ordinates of the identified map using the selected data; and
(e) a display for displaying the thus-established corresponding map grid coordinates to the user.
2. A Navigation aid as claimed in claim 1 wherein there is further provided a transparent overlay for a map, the overlay being marked with a grid having cells of a predetermined cell size, the grid having grid co-ordinate-identifying letters, numbers or the like along the X and Y axes of the grid for identifying each cell; 


wherein in (c), (d) and (e) of claim 1 the mapgπd co-ordinates of the map grid associated with the or each map are the co-ordinates of the grid on the transparent overlay when it is operably positioned on the map
3 A navigation aid as claimed in claim 1 or claim 2, the aid being adapted to display, at the users option by operating a switch provided on the aid, the geographic co-ordinates determined by the receiver or the corresponding map grid co-ordinates
4 A Navigation aid as claimed in any preceding claim wherein the display is adapted to display not only the map grid co-ordinates but also to provide a graphic image of the relevant cell with a marker therein indicating the corresponding position within the cell and wherein the display is adapted to show part or all of one or more adjacent cells and is preferably further adapted to zoom in or out and/or, if the aid is used while moving, scroll from display of one cell to display of another
5 A navigation aid for use with printed maps, the aid comprising
(a) A transparent overlay for a map the overlay being marked with a grid having cells of a predetermined cell size, the grid having grid co-ordinate-identifying letters, numbers of the like along the X and Y axes of the grid for identifying each cell, (b) a receiver of transmitted signals from a geographic position fixing system such as, for example, GPS,, which receiver is operative to determine from the transmitted signals the current geographic co-ordinates of the navigation aid
(c) an electronic database means storing data comprising definitive parameters of one or more maps or series of maps for definition of the correspondence 


between the coordinates of the map grid associated with the or each map and the coordinates of the geographic position fixing system;
(d) processing means for converting the currently determined geographic coordinates into the corresponding map grid co-ordinates of the identified map using the stored data; and
(e) a display for displaying the thus-established corresponding map grid coordinates to the user, wherein in (c), (d) and (e) the mapgrid co-ordinates of the map grid associated with the or each map are the co-ordinates of the grid on the transparent overlay when it is operably positioned on the map.
6. A Navigation aid as claimed in claim 5 werem the overlay has securing means to secure the overlay in a specific position with respect to the map to ensure maintenance of the chosen registration between the map and the grid
7. A Navigation aid as claimed in claim 5 or 6 wherein the overlay is the front face of a waterproof wallet for the map.
8. A Navigation aid as claimed in claim 5 or 6 wherein the overlay is a sheet and the map is a marine navigation chart, the sheet being dimensioned to suit the navigation chart.
9. A navigation aid for use with printed maps, the aid comprising:
(a) a receiver of transmitted signals from a geographic position fixing system such as, for example, GPS;, which receiver is operative to determine from the transmitted signals the current geographic co-ordinates of the navigation aid 


 (b) an electronic database means storing data comprising definitive parameters of one or more maps or seπes of maps for definition of the correspondence between the coordinates of the map grid associated with the or each map and the coordinates of the geographic position fixing system; (c) processing means for converting the currently determined geographic coordinates into the corresponding map grid co-ordinates of the identified map using the stored data;
