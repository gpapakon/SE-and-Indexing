is phenyl, pyridyl, thienyl or pyrrolyl which is unsubstituted 
or mono- or disubstituted by halogen atoms, 

C
1
-C
4
-alkyl, trifluoromethyl, C

by fluorine, methoxy, hydroxyl or amino. 
 
A process for preparing a 3-azabicyclo[3.2.0]
heptane derivative 
of the formula I as claimed in claim 1, which comprises 

subjecting an amine of the formula II 

 
where R

is hydrogen, acetyl, benzyl trifluoroacetyl, to a photochemical 

2+2 cycloaddition in an inert solvent at 20-80°C in 
the presence of about 1 mole of hydrochloric acid per mole of 

amine, and eliminating any acyl or benzyl group R
