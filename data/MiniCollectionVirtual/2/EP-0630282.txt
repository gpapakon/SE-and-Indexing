<CLAIMS>
A self-supporting, coated filter element for filtering particulates or aerosols from the 
ambient air or suspended solids from a liquid, comprising a porous supporting body, and also a 

porous filter layer directed towards the contaminated ambient air or liquid and applied onto the 
supporting body, wherein the supporting body is made of a sintered plastics material, and the filter 

layer is similarly made of this plastics material and is applied adhesively thereto, wherein the 
plastics material is polyethylene, characterised in that the filter layer is made of ultra-high 

molecular polyethylene, and in that the ratio of the average pore size of the micropores of the 
filter layer to the average pore size of the macropores of the supporting body formed by the 

sintering process is 1:3 to 1:6. 
A self-supporting, coated filter element according to Claim 1, characterised in that the 
supporting body is made of a mixture of 1/3 low molecular and 2/3 ultra-high molecular 

polyethylene. 
A self-supporting, coated filter element according to Claim 2, characterised in that the 
supporting body is made of a granulated and then sintered polyethylene which is recovered by 

recycling.
