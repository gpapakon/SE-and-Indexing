<DESCRIPTION>
Motor Vehicle Sun VisorThe present invention relates to a motor vehicle sun visor comprising an oblong plate of plastic material.For safety reasons, sun visors for modern cars comprise either a plate of a relatively soft material, such as foamed plastic, or a hollow plate of a non-foamed plastic. This imparts compressibility to the visors so that they are able to absorb a blow from a vehicle occupant in the event of a collision or under heavy braking.In both cases, the plate is usually covered with a plastic film which serves to give the sun visor an aesthetically pleasing appearance adapted to the interior of the car. A generally employed method for applying the film to the plate comprises applying a film sheet to either side of the plate, welding the film sheets together around the edges of the plate and trimming away the film material outside of the weld line to remove surplus film.Sun visors are manufactured in very large numbers and it is therefore important to automate the manufacturing process to as great a degree as possible in order to keep down the costs. The application of the film is however difficult to carry out entirely without manual assistance.It is the object of the present invention to provide a sun visor comprising an oblong plate of plastic material which is constructed in such a manner that it can be manufactured without a separate surface layer needing to be applied after the production of the plate. 

This is achieved in accordance with the invention by means of the plate consisting of a thermoplastic elastomer whose surface provides the final shape and surface structure of the plate.The invention is based upon the idea of abandoning the conventional approach to sun visors, virtually all of which consist of a rigid backing of one material with a softer surface layer of another material applied thereto, and instead manufacturing sun visors from a single material which, as far as possible, combines the properties of materials previously used for the backing and surface layer. It has hereby been shown to be possible to achieve desired properties by using thermoplastic elastomers. These materials combine the flexibility of rubber with the strength of structural plastics and can be used for the production of the sun visor plate through, for example, conventional blow moulding or injection moulding techniques, whereby the entire sun visor plate with its final surface structure can be produced in a single step.The invention will be described in greater detail with reference to
