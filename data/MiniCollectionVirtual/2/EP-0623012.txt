<ABSTRACT>
This invention is an exceptionally flexible, ultrasoft vaso-occlusive or embolism forming device. It is made of radiopaque material which may be a braid (200), coil (100), or chain (600) which forms a long, thin thread-like device having little rigidity or column strength. The diameter of the device may be less than about 0.010 inches. The filamentary material making up the device used to form the coil (100), braid (200), or chain (600) is typically of a diameter less than about 0.002 inches. The device is sufficiently flexible and small that it may be hydraulically delivered to a site within the vasculature of the human body using an injected drug or fluid flush through a catheter (512). In some configurations, the device may be delivered using pushers (504, 512) to mechanically deliver the device through the catheter lumen. Various mechanical connections may be used to sever the coil by a simple connection of a dissimilar metal to allow electrolytic separation upon application of small voltage is desirable (Figs 5A, 5B).

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention is a flexible,
vaso-occlusive or embolism forming device. It
is made of a
coil which forms a long, thin threadlike device
having little rigidity or column strength. The diameter
of the device is less than about 0.25 mm (0.010 inches). The
filamentary material making up the device used to form
the coil is typically of a diameter less
than about 0.051 mm (0.002 inches). The device is sufficiently
flexible and small that it may be hydraulically delivered
to a site within the vasculature of the human body using
an injected drug or fluid flush through a catheter. In
some configurations, the device may be delivered using
pushers to mechanically deliver the device through the
catheter lumen. Various mechanical connections may be
used to sever the coil but a simple connection of a
dissimilar metal to allow electrolytic separation upon
application of a small voltage is desirable. The device
assumes a random mass of threadlike material after being
ejected from the catheter tip at the chosen vascular
site. The coil may be a
single or of multiple helices. The device
may be used alone or in conjunction
with larger coils or braids to achieve a denser occlusion 
or with fibrous thrombotic attachments or as a substrate
to localize the subsequent infusion of tissue adhesives,
particulate embolization devices, or chemotherapeutic
agents in abnormal blood vessels and tissues. The device
may be used for the temporary occlusion of blood vessels
during types of diminished blood flow testing.Endovascular therapy has been used in treating
a variety of different conditions, including control of
internal bleeding, occlusion of blood supply to tumors,
and relief of vessel wall pressure in the region of
aneurysm. A variety of different embolic agents are
known as arguably suitable for such therapy.One known embolic agent includes injectable
fluids or suspensions, such as microfibrillar collagen,
various polymeric beads, and polyvinyl alcohol foam. The
polymeric agents may be additionally crosslinked,
sometimes in vivo, to extend the persistence of the agent
at the desired vascular site. These agents are often
introduced into the vasculature through a catheter.
After such introduction, materials there form a solid
space-filling mass. Although they provide good short-term
vaso-occlusion, they are ultimately reabsorbed in
the process of vessel recanalization.Polymer resins, typically cyanoacrylates, are
also employed as injectable vaso-occlusive materials. The
resins are typically mixed with a radio-opaque contrast
mate
