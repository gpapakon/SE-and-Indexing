<ABSTRACT>
A regulator circuit supplies a regulated low, DC 
voltage that is derived from an unregulated voltage provided 

by a pair of redundant batteries. The regulator circuit 
comprises regulation control that responds to a feedback 

signal developed from monitoring the regulated voltage to 
maintain the regulated voltage at a desired level. Battery 

monitors supervise the voltage levels of the batteries used, 
and shut down the regulator when the battery voltages drop 

below a predetermined voltage level to preserve battery life.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention is directed generally to voltage 
regulation circuits, and more particularly to a circuit that 
supplies a regulated voltage from a -battery. It is common in the computing industry to use some type 
of backup power to maintain various data processing circuitry 
when main or primary power is removed, either inadvertently or 
intentionally. Often in the form of batteries, such backup 
power is, for example, to sustain the data stored in memories, 
or other storage devices, when main power is removed. Another 
application, one using the present invention, is to use the 
same backup power to maintain operation of a real time clock 
system in absence of main power. Typically, larger (i.e., so-called mainframe) data 
processing systems are provided lead-acid batteries, or the 
like, to provide a backup nominal DC voltage of 
24 volts. The actual voltage range can vary from 26 volts DC 
or greater (when charging or fully charged) to a depleted 
terminal voltage of about 19 volts DC. Using this type of 
battery backup to maintain operation of low voltage (e.g., 3-5 
volts DC) circuits when primary power is lost presents a 
difficult regulation problem, given this 7 volt variance, in 
order that the drop in terminal voltage not be reflected to 
the backed up circuitry. There are regulation circuits on the market today that 
may solve this larger terminal voltage variance problem, but 
at the expense of what can be considered consumption of 
excessive current. (Excessive in some cases can be as little 
as 1 mA. This low value can become "excessive" when the 
circuit using the backup runs continuously over a period of 
months.) This, in turn, results in short-lived battery 
backup, damage to the batteries by discharging them too 
deeply, or both.  
 Thus, it can be seen that some means is needed for 
supplying a regulated low voltage (e.g., about 3 volts DC 
from a backup high DC voltage source (e.g., 24 volts DC) in a 
manner that maintains the regulated low voltage constant in 
the face of depletion of the battery over time, while at the 
same time limiting the current consumed by the regulation 
effort. US 4105962 discloses a constant voltage battery 
charger including a voltage regulator that receives a 
predetermined, constant level, D.C. voltage; means for 
establishing a charging voltage output, and a variable 
resistance-operational amplifier feedback means that operates 
to sense the charger output voltage for regulation, as well 
as to set the charger output voltage. The present

a voltage node (A) coupled to each respective DC

series circuit configuration; 
variable impedance means (12; Q1,R3,R8) coupled to 
the voltage node to receive the positive unregulated voltage

circuit means develops the control signal indicative of the

the positive unregulated voltage and to the control circuit

control signal to place the variable impedance means in a 

high impedance state when the positive unregulated voltage 
has dropped to a predetermined voltage level.

variable impedance means includes a PNP transistor (Q1) 

having an emitter lead coupled to receive the unregulated

means includes for each of the DC batteries a sense circuit 

(16a,16b) operable to substantially terminate current flow 
from the corresponding one of the DC batteries when the 

unregulated voltage supplied by the battery drops to and/or 
below the predetermined voltage level.
