<DESCRIPTION>
The invention concerns an improved measuring/dispensing 
device for liquid products. It is a known fact that detergents are sold in containers, 
often provided with a measuring cap, which guarantees the 
dispensing of a pre-determined and constant quantity of 
detergent. Some measuring/dispensing devices of the known type, foresee 
the use of a ball placed in the interior of dispensing 
channels and immersed in the liquid detergent, which, 
whenever the container is capsized, moves toward the 
dispensing hole thus occluding it after a while. 
Said measuring devices present the inconvenience of having 
a rather limited precision, the dispensed quantity being 
influenced by various parameters, such as the different 
speed at which the ball falls down depending on the viscosity 
of the liquid detergent into which said ball is 
immersed, the speed variations of the ball depending on 
the degree of inclination of the container and finally, the 
speed differences of the detergent itself in relation to 
the liquid head. Other types of as well-known measuring devices present a 
measuring chamber, into which the detergent to be dispensed 
enters when the container is capsized, and a collecting 
chamber, into which the measured detergent enters when the 
container is brought back to its upright position. 
The dispensing of the product occurs when the container is 
capsized again, at which point the pre-measured detergent 
flows out of the collecting chamber, while a new quantity 
of detergent flows from the container into the measuring 
chamber. Such measuring devices present the inconvenience of being 
rather imprecise when the change of the container from its 
vertical position into the dispensing slanted position 
occurs slowly.  
 In order to overcome the mentioned inconveniences, the 
measuring-dispensing device for liquid products object of 
the deposit n. 85695 in the name of the same inventor has 
been disclosed, said device presenting an external body, 
connected to the container, and a dispensing duct, internally 
co-axial with the external body, a ring-shaped area 
being defined between them in which a measuring element is 
arranged, which slides axially and is freely coupled with 
the external body. When the container is capsized, the measuring element 
slides within the external body, thus allowing a measuring 
chamber to be filled up; its contents subsequently flow 
into the measuring element, when the container is brought 
back to its upright position. When the container is capsized again, the
