<ABSTRACT>
A high sensitivity resist layer structure for high energy 
radiation exposure is formed by coating plural layers of 

radiation degradable polymers on a substrate which layers 
have a different cross-link density and thereby have different 

solubility in the resist developer. Upon exposure 

and solvent development, a resist edge profile is obtained 
which can have a predetermined shape.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates generally to resist layer structures 
and more particularly to high sensitivity positive resist 
layers useful in high energy radiation exposure processes. The formation of positive resist masks from layers of radiation 
degradable polymers is described, for example, by 
Haller and Hatzakis in U.S Patent No. 3,535,137. In this 
process a radiation degradable polymer layer is coated on a 
substrate and is subjected to patternwise exposure to high 
energy radiation such as, for example, x-rays, nuclear 
radiation, and electrons. The irradiated regions of the 
polymer suffer a decrease in molecular weight and thereby 
become more soluble. A developer is then used to preferentially 
remove the irradiated portions of the layer. The 
substrate can then be subjected to an additive or 
subtractive process such as metallization or etching with 
the remaining portions of the resist layer protecting the 
substrate from the processing. US Patent 3,934,057, a high sensitivity resist layer structure 
for high energy radiation by coating plural layers of 
polymethyl methacylates radiation degradable on a 
substrate. The layers in a direction away from the  
 
substrate surface are successively slower, dissolving in a 
resist developer. The variation solubility in the developer 
is achieved by depositing a lower molecular weight 
polymethylmethacrylate first and depositing a second layer 
of polymethylmethacrylate having a higher molecular weight. 
A lower molecular weight polymer has a shorter chain length 
than a higher molecular weight polymer and is therefore 
more soluble. IBM Technical Disclosure Bulletin describes forming pattern 
of varying sidewall shape in a thick resist by depositing a 
plurality of layers of resist and exposing each resist 
layer to a pre-exposure radiation to modify the solubility 
of each layer. The sensitivity of the resist layer can be defined by the 
ratio S/S where S is the solubility rate of exposed resist 
for a given exposure dosage and S is the solubility rate 
for the unexposed resist. A S/S ratio of at least 2.0 is 
required to obtain a pattern so that a sufficient unexposed 
resist layer thickness remains after development The 
larger the S/S ratio the sharper the developed image. 
Positive working resists generally have S/S > 10 and 
usually 13. The larger is this ratio the greater will be 
the fidelity of the developed pattern. The closer will be 
the dimensions of the top layer of the pattern to the 
dimensions of the mask used for the exposure of the
