<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to integrated circuits, and more particularly, to
methods for isolating SiO2 layers from PZT, PLZT and platinum structures therein.The silicon chip has become a symbol of modern electronics. Semiconductor-based
devices dominate the digital electronic world, and new applications of such
devices are continually being created. As these applications demand greater
optimization, semiconductor devices are developed which are both smaller and faster
than their predecessors.As this optimization process continues, the physical limits of existing
semiconductor technology present barriers to continued miniaturization. One such
barrier is created by the necessity of the use of capacitors in these semiconductor
devices to store charge. For example, some digital memory devices typically require
capacitors to retain the charge necessary to retain memory data intact. Dynamic
RAMs, as such devices are called, must be refreshed periodically to prevent the data
from being lost. The period of time required between such refreshes is important to
computer hardware design, as more complex circuitry is required where the period is
shorter.Unfortunately, the period between required refreshed is dependent upon the
capacitance of certain capacitors within the DRAM integrated circuit. Capacitance
itself is related to the surface area and thickness of the capacitor, with larger and
thinner capacitor surfaces providing a higher capacitance. Since there are practical
limits to the minimum thickness of the capacitor, miniaturization of capacitors leads
to lower capacitance and thereby a shorter period between refreshes. Since there is a
minimum acceptable refresh period, some means for regaining the capacitance lost to
size reduction is needed. One method for increasing the capacitance without 
increasing the physical dimensions of the capacitor is to
utilize a material having a high dielectric constant to
separate the plates of the capacitor.A number of ferroelectric materials are known to have very
high dielectric constants. Ferroelectrics such as lead
zirconate titanate (PZT) and lead lanthanum zirconate
titanate (PLZT) are particularly attractive in this regard,
as thin films of these materials may be deposited on
integrated circuits. Depending on the specific composition
and manner of deposition, dielectric constants in excess of
100 are routinely achieved. US-A-5 046 043 and EP-A-0 448 151
describe devices including such ferroelectrics.Unfortunately, these materials present a number of problems
when
