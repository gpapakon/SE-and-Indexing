N(HETERO)-ARYL-N(HETERO)-TETRALIN-ALKYL-PIPERAZINE HAVING SEROTONINERGIC, DOPAMINERGIC AND ADRENERGIC ACTIVITY . FIELD OF THE INVENTIONThe present invention relates to N(hetero) -aryl-N(hetero)- tetralin-alkyl-piperazine having serotoninergic, dopaminergic and adrenergic activity, the processes for their preparation and relative therapeutic compositions for the treatment of generalized anxiety, depression, schizophrenia, cerebral ischemia, opium like, psycho stimulant substances and alcohol abuse syndromes, and for the therapy of arterial hypertension. PRIOR ART DISCLOSURE The active drugs on 5~HT1A receptor resulted effective in the anxiety therapy. These drugs if compared to benzodiazepine are characterized by having a twofold advantage,they are able to produce anxiolythic activity, contemporaneously avoiding the onset of side effect as for example sedation and addiction [Drugs 41,11. (1991)-Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 8, 383. (1987)], and they can be utilized in some anxiety forms resistant to the treatment with benzodiazepins. In fact drugs having 5-HT1A activity proved useful in the prevention of panic attacks [Psychopharmacology 10,3. (1990)] and for the treatment of obsessive-compulsive disorders [Journal of Psychiatry 147,798, (1990)].The use of compounds showing -HT1A activity has been recently proposed for the treatment of depression [Psychopharmacology 10.77S, (1990) -Psichopharmacology 22, 27, (1989)], and for the 

control of the alcohol abuse [ Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 85, 5274 (1988) - Psychopharmacology 22, 49, (1989)]. Compounds able to combine activity on -HT1A receptor and the capacity of interaction with D-2 and σ receptors may represent a valid therapeutic approach to the treatment of schizophrenia. In fact the association of D-2 with σ activity enhances the antipsychotic effect of the compound, whereas the presence of 5~ HT1A seems able to reduce the hazard of side extr.apiramidal effects.[J. Med. Chem. 34 ,1860, (1991) - J- Neural. Transm. 57, 255, (1983)].Moreover the activity on σ receptors is considered very important in pathologies such as cerebral ischemia in which a massive activation of glutamatergic system is present [J. Med. Chem.35. 1526, ( 1992) ; Med. Chem. Res . 1 , 425 , (1992) ; Drug of Today 27 , 255. (1991 ) ] .Finally the use of active compounds on 5-HTIA receptor, or compounds having mixed activity on 5-HTlA/α-l receptors has been recently suggested for the treatment of arterial hypertension [Naunyn-Schmiedeberg' s Arch. Pharmacol. 336,597, (I987)]. The above finds
