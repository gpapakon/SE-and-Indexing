<ABSTRACT>
Thermoplastic uni-axially co-oriented film, method 
of making the film and heavy-duty shipping bags made 

therefrom. The method allows for the manufacture of heavy 
duty bags made from blown thermoplastic films. Shipping, 

such as courier, bags have improved strength, puncture and 
snag resistance.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to thermoplastic, cold drawn 
oriented film and to sacks made therefrom. Thermoplastic sacks and bags are used in the 
packaging, transportation or storage of a great variety of 
materials ranging from confidential documents, powders and 
granules, bulky and lightweight materials, and agricultural 
materials such as hay and silage. The thermoplastic bags 
according to this invention have general applicability to 
such products. Bulky, but lightweight materials such as fibreglass 
insulation and peat moss are generally shipped in compressed 
form in thermoplastic sacks. These sacks are generally known 
as tubular insulation sacks or bags and take the form of an 
extended envelope or tube sealed at one end prior to its 
being filled with product. For the most part these bags are 
produced by the commonly known in the art "blown film" 
process, which owes its popularity to the fact that it can 
be quickly and readily adapted to the production of different 
widths and thicknesses of continuous tubes which can then be 
easily cut to length and sealed at one end to produce an open 
top bag. It will be readily appreciated that the thinner the 
film thickness (gauge), commensurate with acceptable film 
properties, the less the amount of thermoplastic material 
required. This downgauging of sack wall thickness is a most 
desirable industrial goal. Walls of sacks produced as tubes 
by the blown film process, typically, have a film thickness 
in the range of 3-6 mil, which is generally determined by the  
 
machine direction tensile strength necessary to handle the 
package weight, the film stretch resistance required to 
prevent expansion of the compressed product and the puncture 
resistance of the bag for distribution handling. The tubes 
from which these sacks are commonly made are produced with 
a bubble diameter/die diameter generally of 3:1 in order to 
optimize film strength properties. The typical film manufacturing process basically 
comprises the step of extruding molten thermoplastic material 
through a circular die, typically having a 0.125 cm die gap 
to form a tube which is closed by passing an end through a 
set of nip/draw rolls. Air is introduced through the die 
centre to inflate the film tube to the desired width and 
thickness while the speed of the nip rolls is increased to 
draw the film thickness down to the desired gauge. For most 
out-of-line bag making operations the film tube is then trim 
slit to the desired size and wound up into two film rolls 
which are then

orienter, and 

cold drawing said plurality of non-oriented films 
wherein said films are in such close proximity, 

one to another under said cold drawing as to form 
said unified uni-axially co-oriented film from 

said plurality of films. 
A method as claimed in Claim 4 wherein at least 
one of said plurality of non-oriented films is 

formed of polyethylene.

collapsing said tube to provide a flattened tube 

constituting a plurality of non-oriented films; 
feeding said flattened tube to a cold draw 

orienter; and 
cold drawing said tube in a single direction 

wherein said plurality of non-oriented films are 
in such close proximity one to another under said 

cold drawing as to form said unified uni-axially 
co-oriented film.
