<ABSTRACT>
The feedthrough (penetration, through) tubes (8) are fixed by hooping in openings passing through the domed (convex) wall (2). One end (8a) of the tubes projecting from the convex surface of the wall (2) is closed in a leaktight manner and a wall (18) carrying an electron gun (19) is attached and fixed in a leaktight manner onto the domed wall (2) so as to define a leaktight chamber (24). A reduced pressure is set up inside the leaktight chamber (24) and the aim (19a) of the electron gun (19) is directed along a generatrix of the region where a feedthrough tube (8) joins with a through opening of the domed wall (2). The junction region is scanned with an electron beam by moving the electron gun (19) in rotation about the axis of the feedthrough tube (8). The invention is, in particular, applicable to welding feedthrough adaptors (8) of a vessel head (2) of a pressurised water nuclear reactor.
