<ABSTRACT>
An apparatus for modifying a database query including 
means (300) for graphically displaying in at least two 

dimensions data (330) obtained from a database by the database 
query, means (335) for selecting at least one portion of the 

graphically displayed data (330), and means for modifying the 
database query according to the selected portion of the 

graphically displayed data (330). In addition, a method for 
modifying a database query including the steps of graphically 

displaying in at least two dimensions data (330) obtained from 
a database by the database query, selecting at least one 

portion of the graphically displayed data (330), and modifying 
the database query according to the selected portion of the 

graphically displayed data (330).

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates generally to computer stored 
databases and more particularly to a method and apparatus for 
modifying a database query utilizing a graphical user 
interface. Computer stored databases have attracted an increasing 
amount of interest, not only because of the rapid expansion in 
the data stored and retrieved by these databases, but also as 
a result of the data relationships which can be established 
during the storage or retrieval processes. With the growing 
prevalence of relational databases, the training and 
experience of a typical end user has decreased as available 
resources have increased. Novice users of databases have been 
particularly desirous of improvements in the graphical user 
interfaces to control the database applications. One of the more difficult elements of problem solving 
when using a database is often the identification of the 
sources that causes a particular problem. Search statements 
for queries are usually used for searching information stored 
in a database in an organized fashion to help problem solving. 
When users have few clear ideas about how to construct the 
problem query for solving a problem, a common approach is to 
start by examining an initial query report resultant from an 
initial query for more information. Based on this 
information, the user then decides how to narrow the search 
further within the database. If these narrowed searches do 
not produce the desired result then the user must back up to 
a previous search statement and try again. Current search techniques are cumbersome, inhibiting 
efficient query formulation. Usually, query reports are 
output only and query formulations are input only. When users 
have no ideas about what exact information is required by a 
problem, they tend to look in initial query report for more 
information and then decide how to narrow the search further 
by modifying the query formulation. The above drawbacks of the prior art are overcome by the  
 
invention as claimed. Accordingly, the present invention includes an apparatus 
for modifying a database query including apparatus for 
graphically displaying in at least two dimensions data 
obtained from a database by the database query, apparatus for 
selecting at least one portion of the graphically displayed 
data, and apparatus for modifying the database query according 
to the selected portion of the graphically displayed data. In 
addition, the present invention includes a method for 
modifying a database query including the steps of

<CLAIMS>
An apparatus for modifying a database query comprising: 
   means (300) for graphically displaying in at least two 

dimensions data (330) obtained from a database by the database 
query; 

   means (335) for selecting at least one portion of the 
graphically displayed data (330); and 

   means for modifying the database query according to the 
selected portion of the graphically displayed data (330). 
The apparatus of Claim 1 further comprising means for 
iteratively actuating said means (300) for graphically 

displaying, means (335) for selecting and means for modifying. 
The apparatus of Claim 1 or 2 wherein the means (300) for 
graphically displaying includes means for graphically 

displaying a line chart (350) of the data obtained by the 
database query. 
The apparatus of Claim 3 wherein the means (335) for 
selecting includes means for utilizing a variable sized box 

(355,356) to select at least one portion of the line chart 
(350). 
The apparatus of any Claim from 1 to 4 wherein the means 
for selecting (335) includes means for selecting multiple 

portions of the graphically displayed data (330). 
The apparatus of any Claim from 1 to 5 wherein the means 
for modifying includes means for modifying the database query 

with a WHERE clause according to the selected portion of the 
graphically displayed data (330). 
A method for modifying a database query comprising the 
steps of: 

   graphically displaying in at least two dimensions data 
 

(330) obtained from a database by the database query; 
   selecting at least one portion of the graphically 

displayed data (330); and 
   modifying the database query according to the selected 

portion of the graphically displayed data (330). 
The method of Claim 7 further comprising the step of 
repeating the steps of graphically displaying, selecting and 

modifying. 
The method of Claim 7 or 8 wherein the step of graphically 
displaying includes graphically displaying a line chart (350) 

of the data obtained by the database query. 
The method of Claim 9 wherein the step of selecting 
includes utilizing a variable sized box (355,356) to select at 

least one portion of the line chart (350). 
The method of any Claim from 7 to 10 wherein the step of 
selecting includes selecting multiple portions of the 

graphically displayed data (330). 
The method of any Claim from 7 to 11 wherein the step of 
modifying includes modifying the database query with a WHERE 

clause according to the selected portion of the graphically 
displayed data (330).
