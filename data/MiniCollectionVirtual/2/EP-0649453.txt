<ABSTRACT>
Azeotropic or azeotrope-like compositions comprise admixtures of effective amounts of perfluoroethane and trifluoromethane, or nitrous oxide, or carbon dioxide, or fluoromethane to form an azeotropic or azeotrope-like composition. Such compositions are useful as cleaning agents, expansion agents for polyolefins and polyurethanes, refrigerants, aerosol propellants, heat transfer media, gaseous dielectrics, fire extinguishing agents, power cycle working fluids, polymerization media, particulate removal fluids, carrier fluids, buffing abrasive agents, and displacement drying agents.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to 
azeotropic or azeotropre-like compositions 
comprising effective amounts of perfluoroethane and trifluoromethane, 
to form an azeotropic or azeotrope-like 
composition. Such compositions are useful as cleaning agents, expansion agents for 
polyolefins and polyurethanes, refrigerants, aerosol propellants, heat transfer media, 
gaseous dielectrics, fire extinguishing agents, power cycle working fluids, 
polymerization media, particulate removal fluids, carrier fluids, buffing abrasive 
agents, and displacement drying agents. Fluorinated hydrocarbons have many uses, one of which is as a 
refrigerant. In refrigeration applications, a refrigerant is often lost during operation 
through leaks in shaft seals, hose connections, solder joints, and broken lines. In 
addition, the refrigerant may be released to the atmosphere during maintenance 
procedures on refrigeration equipment. Accordingly, it is desirable to use a single fluorinated hydrocarbon or 
an azeotropic or azeotrope-like composition that includes one or more fluorinated 
hydrocarbons as a refrigerant. Some nonazeotropic compositions that include one 
or more fluorinated hydrocarbons may also be used as refrigerants, but they have 
the disadvantage of changing composition, or fractionating, when a portion of the 
refrigerant charge is leaked or discharged to the atmosphere. If a non-azeotropic 
composition contains a flammable component, the blend could become flammable 
because of such a change in composition. Refrigerant equipment operation could 
also be adversely affected due to the change in composition and vapor pressure that 
results from fractionation. Fluorinated hydrocarbons may also be used as a cleaning agent or 
solvent to clean, for example, electronic circuit boards. Electronic components are 
soldered to circuit boards by coating the entire circuit side of the board with flux  
 
and thereafter passing the flux-coated board over preheaters and through molten 
solder. The flux cleans the conductive metal parts and promotes solder fusion, but 
leave residues on the circuit boards that must be removed with a cleaning agent. Preferably, cleaning agents should have a low boiling point, 
nonflammability, low toxicity, and high solvency power so that flux and flux-residues 
can be removed without damaging the substrate being cleaned. Further, it is 
desirable that cleaning agents that include a fluorinated hydrocarbon be azeotropic 
or azeotrope-like so that they do not tend to fractionate upon boiling or 
evaporat
