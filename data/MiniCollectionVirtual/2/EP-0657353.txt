<ABSTRACT>
The present invention provides a band clamp with a 
band and a separate buckle. 

The lock is of the type of lock where the 
band (304) is passed through the buckle (302) and then shaped to form 

a locking surface (332) that engages the exterior of the buckle 
to prevent the band from being pulled back through the 

buckle, wherein the banding tool forms both a band 
lock (332) on one band end (308) and a retaining member (504) on the 

opposite 
band end (306) such that the retaining member inhibits the non-attached 

buckle from separating from the band during lock formation.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates in general to securing a band
to a buckle of a band clamp, and in particular to an
improved lock between a band and a buckle as well as a
method for forming the improved lock.The use of a hand tool to tighten a band clamp has
long been known. Band clamps are typically used to secure
bundles of materials together and to secure pipes, wiring,
etc. In one such application, a band clamp is applied to
secure a protective metal braiding around a bundle of
wiring which is connected to a plug or coupler known as a
back shell.Back shells are frequently used in military and aero-space
applications where wiring carrying low voltage
signals are conducted. Both the cables and the connectors
must be protectively covered with a metallic substance to
limit the harmful effects of radiation thereon. This
metallic shielding must be without any "windows" (openings)
and must in all parts have a ground connection with only
low resistance to effectively minimize any electrical
potential this "shielding" system may receive due to
external or internal electromagnetic radiation (such as
radio emission, cosmic rays, lightning strike, explosion of
an atomic device, etc.). The diameter of the back shell
body is typically larger than the diameter of the cable
entering thereinto, and in order to have a satisfactory 
interconnection, a banding tool must be capable of applying
a band clamp proximate the intersection of the back shell
body and the cable entry stem. Thus the banding tool should
be approximately the same width as the band clamp to be
applied and should be capable of applying the band clamp
from any direction.One tool for tightening band clamps to a back shell is
disclosed in U.S. Patent No. 4,726,403, to Young et al.,
February 23, 1988. The Young et al. device uses a toggle
arrangement to tension the band clamp in place. Upon
reaching the appropriate tension in the band clamp, the
tool locks in a closed condition. To sever the tail from
the tightened band clamp, a cutting arm must be rotated
outwardly and upwardly from the side of the banding tool.Due to the externally attached cutting device, the
Young et al. banding tool is capable of applying a band
clamp close to the back shell from only one direction. If
a band is attempted to be connected from the opposite
direction, the cutting device may prevent proper installation.
The Young et al. tool is therefore limited in its
application and becomes difficult to operate in confined
spaces such as are found in aircraft fuselages.Additionally, Young's

A method for clamping an object (17) comprising:

providing a band (304) having a longitudinal axis extending from a first end (306) to
a second end (308) said band (304) also having a buckle (302) adjacent said first end, a

first lateral edge (310a) and a second lateral edge (310b) both extending between
said first end (306) and said second end of said band (304);
disposing said band (304) with said buckle (302) about the object, inserting
said second end (308) through a buckle passageway (324) and
producing a lock (560) on said band (304)
while tension of said band remains substantially the same along said

longitudinal axis of said band (304), in which said lock (560) has a cross
section, taken vertically to the longitudinal axis, that includes two points (336, 340)

such that a line of points between said two points (336, 340) has a third point (338)
outside said cross section, with a first point (336) of said two points being on said

first lateral edge (310a), and a second point (340) of said two points being on said
second lateral edge (310b) substantially opposite to said first point (336) relative to

said longitudinal axis of said band (304), said method being characterised in that it
comprises the steps of


forming a retaining member (504) on said first end (306) of said band;
said forming step including


inserting said first end (306) of said band into a tool (10) having at least
a first tool component (540 or 544); and
creating said retaining member (504) using said first tool component
(540 or 544),

said band (304) remaining inserted in said tool
(10) during all of said creating step;
a cross section of said retaining member (504), between a first point on said
first lateral edge (310a), and a second point on said second lateral edge (310b)

substantially opposite to said first point relative to said longitudinal axis of said band
(304), including two points such that a line of points between said two points has a

third point outside said cross section;
locating the buckle (302) adjacent to said retaining member (504)

by inserting the band (304) into the buckle passageway (324)
wherein said forming step includes using at least one tool component (540 or

544) equivalent to said first tool component (540 or 544) for producing said lock.
A method, as claimed in claim 1, wherein:

said producing step includes positioning said second end of said band (304) in
a first direction into said tool (10), and 

said inserting step includes inserting said first end (306) in a second direction,
opposite said first direction, into said tool (10).
A method, as claimed in claim 1 or 2, wherein:

said first end (306) of said band (304) is placed between a first band contacting
portion (552) of said first tool component (544) and a second band contacting

portion (556) of a second tool component (540), and said first and second band
contacting portion (552, 556) are forced together for deforming said first end to form

said retaining member (504).
A method, as claimed in claim 1, 2 or 3, wherein:

said tool (10) does not contact said buckle (302) when forming said retaining
member (504), and said first tool component (504) contacts the buckle (302) when

forming said lock (560).
A method, as claimed in one of claims 1 to 4, wherein:

said retaining member (504) contacts an exterior end portion of the buckle
(302) for inhibiting a separation of the band (304) and the buckle (302).
A method, as claimed in one of claims 1 to 5, wherein:

said step of creating said retaining member (504) includes controlling a
retaining member formation switch (708) to activate pneumatic components of a

pneumatically controlled banding tool (650).
A band clamp comprising a band (304) having a length for wrapping about
an object (17), said band (304) also having two lateral edges, a first end portion

(306) and a second end portion that define band segments at opposed ends of the
band length; a buckle (302) having a passageway for inserting said second end

portion; a lock (560) formed in said second end portion,

said buckle (302) maintaining said first end portion (306) and said second end
portion relative to each other

said band clamp being characterized in that:
the buckle has a passageway (324) for receipt of both

said first end portion (306), and said second end portion,
said band (304) comprises a retaining member (504) formed in said first end
portion (306), said retaining member (504) having a cross section between a first

point on the first lateral edge and a second point on the second lateral edge
substantially opposite to said first point relative to said longitudinal axis of said

band, such that a line drawn between said two points has at least a third point outside
said cross section to inhibit a separation of said band (304) and said buckle (302), 

said retaining member having been formed by at least one tool component (540 or
544) that is equivalent to a first tool component (540 or 544) that has been used to

form said lock.
