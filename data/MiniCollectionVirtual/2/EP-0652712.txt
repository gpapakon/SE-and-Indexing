<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to improved low
moisture chewing gums of the type which do not contain
petroleum wax or mineral wax.U.S. Patent No. 3,984,574, issued to Comollo,
discloses an abhesive chewing gum base in which the
non-tack properties were achieved by eliminating
conventional chewing gum base ingredients which were
found to contribute to chewing gum tackiness, and by
substituting non-tacky ingredients in place of the
conventional ingredients. Specifically, it was
discovered that three classes of materials account for
conventional chewing gum tackiness. These materials
are elastomers, resins, and waxes. Comollo eliminated natural and some
synthetic elastomers from chewing gum base, and
substituted in their place one or more non-tacky
synthetic elastomers such as polyisobutylene,
polyisoprene, isobutylene-isoprene copolymer and
butadiene-styrene copolymer. Comollo also eliminated
the tack-producing natural resins and modified
natural resins and used instead relatively high
amounts of hydrogenated or partially hydrogenated
vegetable oils or animal fats. Finally, Comollo
completely excluded waxes from the gum base, but
included polyvinyl acetate, fatty acids, and mono and
diglycerides of fatty acids.US patent 5023093 issued to Cherukuri and
Mansukhani discloses a low calorie chewing gum base
containing polyvinyl acetate wherein the gum base
comprises 40% to 90% of the chewing gum.The present invention is directed to wax-free,
low moisture chewing gum manufactured using wax-free
gum bases and other essentially dried ingredients
wherein the total amount of moisture contained in the
final chewing gum product ranges from 0.1 weight
percent to 2.0 weight percent water. The term
"essentially dried" as used herein means less than 10
weight percent water and is used to describe
ingredients which are anhydrous as well as
ingredients containing as much as 10.0 weight percent
water. These essentially dried, i.e. from 0 to 10%
water, materials may be, for example dextrose or
sucrose solid crystalline compounds or corn syrup
solids, other types of sweeteners or sweetener
solids, or such formulated products such as
coevaporated Lycasin TM. Generally speaking, our
wax-free low moisture gums are made using a wax-free
gum base, bulking agents, binders and sweeteners (all
herein referred to generally as sweeteners) 
where the bulking agents are the usual crystalline or
powered sugars, sugar alcohols, and the like, and the
binders are low moisture modified syrups such as
those described in U.S. Patent No.
