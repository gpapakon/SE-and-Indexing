<ABSTRACT>
A melt processable segmented polyurethane with a hard segment composition in the 
range about 20 percent to about 40 percent. The polyurethane of the invention has a soft 

segment that includes an aliphatic diol having a molecular weight greater than about 1000. 
The aliphatic diol used in the invention is substantially free of ester and ether linkages, thus 

substantially eliminating potential sites for biodegradation and formation of potentially harmful 
low molecular weight extractable fragments. As a result of the low percentage hard segment, 

the polyurethane of the invention is inherently soft without the use of low molecular weight 
plasticizers and is well suited for applications requiring prolonged exposure to body fluids and 

enzymes. Such applications include pacemaker lead insulation, indwelling catheters, drainage 
devices and the like.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to biomedical devices, and more particularly to a new 
polyurethane having resistance to degradation by body fluids suitable for forming or for 
coating medical devices intended for internal implantation. In the biomedical art area, much research effort is expended to develop and qualify 
materials for implantation in the body. To be suitable for such applications, a material must 
not only have physical properties such as strength and flexibility, it should be stable to the 
various fluids and enzymes present in the body. Many types of compounds are used in these applications, and polyurethanes often are 
selected. In general, polyurethanes have a good balance of physical and mechanical properties 
as well as superior blood compatibility when compared to other polymers such as silicone 
rubber, polyethylene, polyvinyl chloride and perfluorinated polymers. Some important 
applications of polyurethanes include peripheral and central venous catheters, coatings for 
pacemaker leads, drainage devices, implants and the like. Polyurethanes are synthesized from three basic components; a diisocyanate, a 
polyglycol and a chain extender, usually a low molecular weight diol, diamine or water. If the 
extender is a diol, the polyurethane consists entirely of urethane linkages. If the extender is 
water, amino alcohol or a diamine, both urethane and urea linkages are present and the 
polyurethane is more accurately and conventionally termed a polyurethaneurea. Polyurethanes develop microdomaines, conventionally termed hard segments (HS) and 
soft segments, and as a result are often referred to as segmented polyurethanes or block 
copolymers. The hard segments form by localization of the portions of the polymer molecules 
which include the diisocyanate and the extender components and are generally highly 
crystalline. The soft segments form from the polyglycol portions of the polymer chains and 
generally are either amorphous or only partially crystalline. A way of describing the difference 
between the hard and soft segments may be to consider the components comprising the hard 
section as a homopolymer having a glass transition temperature (Tg) above the normal use 
temperature range with the components comprising the soft segment as a homopolymer 
having a Tg below the normal use temperature. Thus, the bulk properties of the copolymer 
are a function of the degree of crystallinity and hard segment content. W. Lemm in
