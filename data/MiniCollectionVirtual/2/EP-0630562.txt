<ABSTRACT>
A device for automatically milking animals 
comprises a milking parlour (1), a computer-controlled 

milking machine with teat cups (52) which are automatically 
connectable to the teats of an animal to be milked. The 

device is further provided with computer-controlled fodder 
supply means with a manger (9). This manger is displaceable 

relative to the milking parlour (1). Particularly, the 
displacement has at least a component in the length direction 

of the milking parlour (1).

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a device according to the
preamble of claim 1.Such a device is known from DE-A-2 535 214.This known device has the disadvantage that it is
still accessible to the animal, although the manger retains
the same upright orientation. When the exit door has been
opened, and there is still fodder in the manger which the
animal could not eat due to the fact that the milking time is
shorter than the time to eat the fodder, the animal has still
the opportunity to eat from the manger, as a result of which
the animal blocks partly the milking parlour, so that a next
animal can not enter the milking parlour.The invention has for its object to overcome the
above-mentioned disadvantage or at least to minimize this
disadvantage.According to the invention this is achieved in that
the milking machine is constituted by a computer-controlled
milking machine which connects the teat cups automatically to
the teats of an animal to be milked, while the device is
furthermore provided with computer-controlled fodder supply
means for supplying fodder from a fodder storage container to
the manger, which cooperate with animal identifying means,
while the exit door is connected to the device by a
parallelogram structure, such that its orientation remains
substantially the same during opening and closing, moving the
manger out of reach of the animal.In this way it is possible to displace the manger
out of the reach of an animal present in the milking parlour,
while it is prevented that fodder, which the animal did not
eat, drops out of the manger when the exit door is opened.
The device may be further characterized in that the entrance door
and the exit door are operable by computer-controlled 
activating means, such as hydraulic or pneumatic cylinders
and the exit door being at the front side of the milking
parlour. In a particular embodiment the doors are movable
outwardly and upwardly by means of the
parallelogram construction. To facilitate entering of the
milking parlour by the animal, and to utilize the space of
the milking parlour in a favourable manner, the milking
parlour preferably has bars running along each side which laterally
restrict the animal's freedom of movement to a particular
area, outside of which a milking unit and a cleaning and/or
drying unit could be positioned when non-operative, at the
entrance to the parlour the bars being angled inwards from
the walls in the direction of the exit.When the number of animals to be milked is
relatively large, more milking parlours may be utilized.

<CLAIMS>
A device for automatically milking animals, such as
cows, comprising a milking parlour (1), a milking machine

with teat cups (2) which are connectable to the teats of an
animal to be milked, fodder storage containers and a manger

(9) attached to the exit door which, upon opening the exit
door (4), is displaceable relative to the milking parlour

(1), characterized in that the milking machine is constituted
by a computer-controlled milking machine which connects the

teat cups (52) automatically to the teats of an animal to be
milked, while the device is furthermore provided with

computer-controlled fodder supply means for supplying fodder
from a fodder storage container to the manger (9), which

cooperate with animal identifying means, while the exit door
(4) is connected to the device by a parallelogram structure,

such that its orientation remains substantially the sane
during opening and closing, moving the manger out of reach of

the animal. 
A device as claimed in claim 1, characterized
in that an entrance door (3) and the exit door (4) are

operable by computer-controlled activating means, such as
hydraulic or pneumatic cylinders and the exit door (4) being

at the front side of the milking parlour (1).
A device as claimed in any one of the preceding
claims, characterized in that the doors are movable outwardly

and upwardly by means of the parallelogram construction.
A device as claimed in any one of the preceding
claims, characterized in that the milking parlour (1) has

bars (27) running along each side which laterally restrict
the animal's freedom of movement to a particular area,

outside of which a milking unit (28) and a cleaning and/or
drying unit (28) could be positioned when non-operative, at

the entrance to the parlour (1) the bars (27) being angled
inwards from the walls in the direction of the exit. 
A device as claimed in any one of the preceding
claims, characterized in that the device comprises at least

two milking parlours (1), in the length direction parallel to
each other and each having an entrance door (3) and an exit

door (4) at a short side of a milking parlour (1).
A device as claimed in claim 5, characterized in
that the milking parlours (1) are separated from each other

by partitions (26).
