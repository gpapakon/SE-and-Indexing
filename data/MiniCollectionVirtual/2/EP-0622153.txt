<ABSTRACT>
The rotary indexing table (4) has a plurality of receiving elements (5) for the articles to be treated or machined, having one operating member (7) each, e.g. a clamping jaw. The operating member (7) is actuated by a pneumatic cylinder (8). For actuation, a cylinder (23) fixed on the frame is actuated, the piston of which is in alignment with a sensor (26) in the relevant position of the table (4). The sensor (26) actuates the cylinder (8) via a valve (29). For feedback, the position of the member (7) is scanned by a sensor (31) which controls a cylinder (27) mounted on the table (4). In alignment with its piston rod (28) is a further sensor (25) which indicates the executed movement of the member (7) to a control unit (33). This controlling device is flexible and operationally reliable.

Indexing turntable, with a frame (2) having a bearing 
element (3) on which a table (4) is rotatably mounted, the table 

(4) having about its periphery several receiving elements 
(5) for articles that are to be processed or operated, the 

table (4) being turned when in operation step by step so that 
the receiving elements (5) are taken past a series of stations 

(A-D) fixed to the frame, each receiving element (5) being 
provided with at least one movable operating member (7) mounted 

on the table, a conduit (21) being routed through the bearing 
element (3) for the supply of a pressure medium to the table 

(4), and each operating member (7) being connected to a operating 
element (30) of an actuator (8) driven by a pressure medium, 

which is controlled by a valve (29) connected to the supply 
conduit (21), characterized in that at least one station (A-D) 

on the frame (2) a first lifting device (23) with a movable 
first lifting element (24) is mounted, and that each receiving 

element (5) is provided with at least one first sensor (26) for 
establishing the position of the first lifting element (24) at 

the respective rotational position of the table (4), which controls 
the respective valve (29). 
Turntable according to claim 1, in which a second sensor 
(31) is fitted to each receiving element (5) which operates 

via a second valve (32) in each case a second lifting device 
(27) with a movable second lifting element (28) assigned to 

the respective receiving element (5) and mounted on the table 
(4), and in which at least one third sensor (25) for establishing 

the position of the second lifting element (28) is 
mounted on the frame (
2). 
Turntable according to claim 2, in which the third sensor 
(25) is connected to a control unit (33) which controls the 

first lifting device (23) via a switch element (34).  
 
Turntable according to any one of claims 1 to 3, in which 
the first, second and third sensors (26, 31, 25) are proximity 

switches, preferably inductive proximity switches. 
Turntable according to any one of claims 1 to 4, in which 
the first and second lifting devices (23, 27) are constructed as 

cylinder assemblies whose piston rods form the first and second 
lifting elements (24, 28).
