<ABSTRACT>
A method is disclosed for improving the vacuum inside glass liners for vacuum bottles, according to which, in a space (1), between the double walls (2 and 2') of the glass liner (3), and after its silvering and drying, one or more "getters" (4) are introduced into it through a tubette (5). When the pumping out of the air is done from below and the tubette (5) is positioned on the lower central portion of the liner, a part (6) is introduced into the tubette which lodges itself in the lower opening (7) of the outer wall (2). This forms a barrier or filter which prevents the "getters" (4) from escaping from the space (1). The part (6) is equipped with openings (6A), as well as lower (6B) and upper (6C) grips, working as springs. Part (6) is not necessary if the pumping operation is done from below and the tubette (5) is positioned on the lower side portion or on the upper portion of the liner, or if the pumping operation is done from above or from the side, or in addition, if the "getter" itself has physical, chemical or mechanical elements which cause it to expand to larger dimensions than the internal diameter of the tubette (5). Furthermore, the part (6) is not necessary if, after having introduced the "getter" through the tubette, the latter's diameter is narrowed by means of the softening of the glass and its stretching.

<DESCRIPTION>
METHOD AND APPARATUS FOR IMPROVING THE VACUUM INSIDE LINERS FOR VACUUM BOTTLESField of the Invention The present invention relates generally to vacuum bottles and, more particularly, concerns a liner for said bottles which exhibits an improved vacuum. Background of the Invention The great majority of vacuum bottles are manufactured with vacuum-insulated glass liners, such liners having double walls with a sligth distance between them. This results in an internal space in which a vaccum is created when the air existing in the internal space is pumped out through a tubette, normally located at the lower extreme of the liner's external wall, and sometimes, on the upper part or the side of the same. The tubette is sealed off once the desired vacuum pressure has been reached. Prior to pumping the air out of the internal space, the double walls of the liner are internally mirrored or silvered through a chemical process in which water is one of the elements present. After mirroring, in order to pump the air from the space between the walls which have been mirrored, efficient drying is necessary so as to allow for a vacuum at an adequate pressure to permit the vacuum liner to function properly.This drying is seldom efficient, for in addition to water, which produces steam vapors, gases are present which continue to be generated by other chemical components used in the mirroring process, and the glass walls themselves also emit gases when subjected to a vacuum. This freeing of gases requires nearly perfect drying, which is difficult to achieve at levels permitting a sufficient vacuum for effective thermal insulation.The use of "getters" which absorb gases would reduce 

this problem, for the same would work in the vacuum space as small vacuum pumps, absorbing the residual gases remaining in the pumped-out space due to lack of drying, before and during the pumping process. Using "getters" before mirroring is inconvenient, because they are contaminated by the mirroring solution, and upon such contamination, high temperatures and prolonged drying times are required for the "getters" to be able to work as "getters" once again. In accordance with the present invention, one or more "getters" are introduced after the bottle has been mirrored and dried, the same remaining totally efficient in absorbing the residual gases due to their being easily activated. These dry "getters" are introduced into the space which exists between the double liner walls through the tubette in the external wall of the same and through which

CLAIM 1. A method for improving the vacuum inside glass liners for vacuum bottles, the liner being of the type having a space (1) between spaced walls (2 and 2'), which make up the glass liner (3) and a tubette providing communication between the space (1) and the exterior of the liner, the liner (3) being mirrored and dried during manufacture, said process comprising the following steps: - providing said tubette (5) with an inside diameter less than the spacing between the walls (2 and 2'); introducing at least one getter (4) through the tubette (5) , the getters (4) being sufficiently small to fit within the tubette (5) ; and - introducing a part (6) into the tubette (5) after the getters (4) have been inserted, such part (6) being dimensioned and shaped to lodge within the space (1) at the entrance of the tubette (5) thereinto, thus forming a barrier or filter which keeps the getters (4) from coming out of the inside of the space (1) as a result the pumping out of the air contained inside such space or as a result of the force of gravity. 2- The method, of claim 1 characterized in that the part (6) has: - openings (6A) which are dimensioned to be smaller than the getters (4) , yet to allow for the pumping out of the air from the space (1) ; lower resilient grips (6B) positioned to remain within the tubette (5) and to act as springs which keep the part (6) tightly lodged against the inside wall of the tubette (5) ,- and
- upper resilient grips (6C) positioned in space (1) , also having the same spring effect which causes them to when open to a diameter larger than that of the tubette (5) , thus keeping the part (6) from being drawn out of the space (1) and into the tubette (5) . 


3- A method for improving the vacuum inside glass liners for vacuum bottles, the liner being of the type having a space (1) between spaced walls (2 and 2'), which make up the glass liner (3) and a tubette providing communication between the space (1) and the exterior of the liner, the liner (3) being mirrored and dried during manufacture, said process comprising the following steps:
- providing said tubette (5) at a lower side portion or an upper portion of the liner (3) ; introducing at least one getter (4) through the tubette (5) , the getters (4) being sufficiently small to fit within the tubette (5) .
- whereby the getters (4) are not dragged out by the pumping out of air through the tubette (5) , nor will they fall out as a result of the force of gravity.
4- A method for improving the vacuum inside glass liners for vacuum bottles, the liner being of the type having a space (1) between spaced walls (2 and 2'), which make up the glass liner (3) and a tubette providing communication between the space (1) and the exterior of the liner, the liner (3) being mirrored and dried during manufacture, said process comprising the following steps: - providing said tubette (5) with an inside diameter less than the spacing between the walls (2 and 2');
- introducing at least one getter assembly (20) into the space (1) through the tubette (5) , the getters assemblies (20) being of sized to fit within the tubette (5) and having a physical, chemical or mechanical element which makes them expand to larger dimensions than the internal diameter or the tubette

having a space (1) between spaced walls (2 and 2'), which make up the glass liner (3) and a tubette providing communication between the space (1) and the exterior of the liner, the liner (3) being mirrored and dried during manufacture, said process comprising the following steps:
- providing said tubette (5) with an inside diameter less than the spacing between the walls (2 and 2') ; introducing at least one getter (4) through the tubette (5) , the getters (4) being sufficiently small to fit within the tubette (5) ; and
- after the introducing step, narrowing the tubette (5) to an internal diameter which is too small to permit getters (4) to enter into the tubette (5) . 6- A method for improving the vacuum inside glass liners for vacuum bottles, the liner being of the type having a space (1) between spaced walls (2 and 2'), which make up the glass liner (3) and a tubette (5) providing communication between the space (1) and the exterior of the liner, the liner (3) being mirrored and dried during manufacture, said method comprising the following steps: introducing at least one getter (4) through the tubette (5) , the getters (4) being sufficiently small to fit within the tubette (5) ; and
