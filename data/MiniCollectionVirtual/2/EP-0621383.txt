<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a ventilated panelling (10) for a wall (11), in particular in the exterior, having first boards (12) which each have a generally planar surface (13) which is directed away from the wall and a surface (20) which is directed towards the wall and, on the surface (13) which is directed away from the wall, exhibit a continuous front groove cheek (14) on both sides, and having second boards (15), of which the cross-section is profiled in each case on the surface (16) directed away from the wall and which are generally planar on the surface (17) directed towards the wall and, on both sides, exhibit a continuous groove (18) into which the front groove cheek (14) is pushed. The novel panelling is characterized in that the first boards (12), on the surface (20) which is directed towards the wall, exhibit a rear groove cheek (21, 21') which continues on both sides in each case and engages behind the surfaces (17) which are directed towards the wall and belong to the adjacent second boards (15).

Ventilated wainscoting (10) for a wall (11), particularly 
in the exterior, comprising first boards (12) 

having each a generally plane surface (13) facing 
away from the wall, and a surface (20) facing the 

wall with a continuous front groove string (14) at 
both sides of the surface (13) facing away from the 

wall, and second boards (15) with the surface (16) 
facing away from the wall each having a profile, and 

with a generally plane surface (17) facing the wall 
with a continuous groove (18) at both sides thereof 

with the front groove string (14) positioned in the 
groove, wherein the first boards (12) at the surfaces 

(20) thereof facing the wall each comprise a continuous 
rear groove string (21, 21') at both sides 

thereof, with the rear groove string engaging the 
surfaces (17) facing the wall of the adjacent second 

boards (15) in the rear thereof, and wherein the 
width of the rear groove string (21, 21') of the 

first boards (12) is about equal with the width (B) 
of the front groove string (14),
characterized in
 
that at one side of the second boards (15) the front 

groove string (22) laterally extends further outwards 
than the rear groove string (23). 
Wainscoting according to claim 1, characterized in 
that the width of the rear groove string (21, 21') 

of the first boards (12) is about equal with the  
 

width (B) of the front groove string (14). 
Wainscoting according to claim 1 or 2, characterized 
in that at one side of the second boards (15) the 

front groove string (22) laterally extends further 
outwards than the rear groove string (23).
