<ABSTRACT>
A method for reforming insulating film such as a BSG 
film formed by CVD technique. The method makes it an 

object to reduce the parasitic capacitance between 
conductor layers between which an insulating film, 

especially a BSG film, intervenes and includes the steps 
of depositing a BSG film 14 on a substrate 1 using a 

depositing gas and exposing the BSG film 14 to a 
reforming gas.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a method for reforming 
insulating borosilicate glass film (hereinafter, referred 
to as "BSG film") formed by a CVD technique. Most of inter-layer insulating films used for 
semiconductor devices are of SiO₂ or SiO₂-based 
materials. Such insulating films of SiO₂ system have a 
relative permittivity of 4.0 (measured at a frequency of 
1 MHz). And the capacitance between the conductor layers 
which an insulating film is held between is thereby 
determined according to the equation:

C = ε₀·ε·A/t 


 
where
 
   ε₀ = the permittivity of the vacuum
 
   ε = relative permittivity of the insulating film
 
   A = the area of the facing or overlapping parts of 
conductor layers between which the insulating film 
intervenes, for computational reasons. However, 
contributions from other parts except for the facing or 
overlapping parts of the conductor layers should be taken 
into account in fact.
 
   t = distance between the conductor layers between 
which the insulating film intervenes
 
   Though such parasitic capacitance as stated above is 
inevitable in any semiconductor device, an excessively 
large value of parasitic capacitance will result in 
crosstalk between conductor layers or delay of signal 
propagation. Particularly, when a multi-layer 
metalization structure is used in order to improve an 
integration level of a semiconductor device, overlapping 
or facing areas of conductors are increased. This 
increase results in increase of the parasitic capacitance  
 
. Also, the smaller the scale of patterns is, the smaller 
the spacing between adjacent conductors is. In case that 
the spacing between adjacent conductors becomes smaller 
than that between the upper and lower conductors, the 
parasitic capacitance will increase so considerably as to 
produce a significant effect on the device characteristic . One of the approaches to the reduction of the 
parasitic capacitance is to reduce relative permittivity 
(ε) of the insulating films between the conductor layers. 
For this purpose, the following measures have been taken 
so far. 
(1) Use of SiO₂ films containing Si-F bonds or F. In case 
that the films are formed by hydrolysis of organic 
silicon compound containing F, 3.7 is obtained as ε of 
the films reportedly. Also, in another case that the 
silicon oxide film containing F is formed by means of a 
plasma CVD technique using a gas mixture consisting of 
C₂F₆ and TEOS (tetraethyl orthosilicate), a low relative 
permittivity is achieved reportedly. (2) Use of organic
