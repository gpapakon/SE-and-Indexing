<ABSTRACT>
A liquid scintillation medium contains 1,2-diphenylethane and derivatives thereof of general formula (I), where the phenyl groups are substituted with hydrogen or lower alkyls (C1-3). In an illustrative embodiment, the liquid scintillation medium comprises 1,2-dicumylethane or 1-cumyl-2-phenylethane and a fluor, the 1,2-diphenylethane compound being liquid at the temperatures of use, i.e., room temperature and below. There is also described a method of detecting beta-ray emissions using the scintillation medium of the present invention.

<DESCRIPTION>
 LIQUID SCINTILLATION MEDIUM WITH A 1 ,2-DICUMYLETHANE SOLVENTTECHNICAL FIELDThis invention relates generally to liquid scintillation media, and more particularly, to liquid scintillation media comprising 1,2-diphenylethane and derivatives thereof, and to methods of detecting beta-ray emissions using the novel liquid scintillation media.BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTIONLiquid scintillation counting is a well-known method for detecting and measuring the concentration of radioactive elements in a sample. It is a particularly useful technique for measuring low energy beta-emitting elements, such as 3H, 14C, 35S, and 32P. Liquid scintillation counting is accomplished by combining the radioactive sample to be analyzed with a liquid scintillation solution or media. The liquid scintillation media comprises, inter alia, an aromatic hydrocarbon scintillation solvent and a fluor. Energy from radioactive decay in the sample excites the aromatic solvent in the scintillation media which then transfers its increased energy to the scintillation fluor, or a combination of fluors. The fluor then releases the increased energy in the form of light pulses which are proportional to the amount of radioactivity in the sample. The light pulses are quantified, or counted, by conventional photomultipliers and associated circuitry, in a known liquid scintillation counter.Well-known and commercially-used scintillation media typically comprise the following aromatic scintillation solvents: toluene, xylenes, ethylbenzenes, cumenes, pseudocumene, mesitylene, phenylcyclohexane, anisole, and dioxane containing a small portion of dissolved naphthalene. The aforementioned scintillation solvents have many disadvantages, such as high vapor pressures and relatively low flash points making them dangerous and inconvenient to use. Moreover, these solvents are toxic and generate hazardous waste. An additional significant disadvantage is that these solvents have relatively high rates of permeation through the walls of polyethylene, polypropylene, or other 

plastic scintillation counting vials commonly used in the industry. Diffusion of the scintillation solvent through the wall of the vial results in an apparent error in the measurement of quenching. This error in turn leads to an error in the calculation of efficiency and, hence, in the calculation of decompositions per minute. A more recently developed scintillation media comprises diisopropylnaphtha- lenes, as disclosed in U.S. Patent No. 4,657,696 which issued to James Thomson on April 14, 1987.
