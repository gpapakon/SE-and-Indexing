<ABSTRACT>
The system includes transmitter means (2) on board the mobile (1) sending out pseudo-random light pulses towards a localisation station (21) including detector means (22), pulses arranged to transmit, to interpretation means (23), the image (24) of a scene containing the mobile (1) delivered by a sighting means (22A), under the control of synchronisation means (27) which are synchronised with the pulses, in which the transmitter means (2) pseudo-random modulate the pulse durations, and the detector means (27, 28, 29) detect these durations and compare them with predetermined durations in order to control the transmission of the image (24) to the interpretation means (23) on the basis of the result of this comparison.

System for localisation of a mobile (1) comprising emitting
means (2) on board the mobile (1) and arranged to emit pseudo-random

luminous pulses, a localisation station (21) comprising detector means
(22) sensitive to these pulses and arranged to transmit, to operating

means (23), the image (24) of a scene containing the mobile (2) issued
by an aiming means (22A), synchronisation means (27) planned to be

synchronised with the pulses, and controlling the transmission of the
image, characterised in that the emitting means (2) are arranged (5-7)

to modulate, in a pseudo-random manner, the duration of the pulses
and the detector means (27, 28, 29) are arranged to detect these

durations and compare them with predetermined durations and control
the transmission of the image (24) to the operating means (23)

depending on the result of this comparison.
System according to claim 1, in which the emitting means (2) are
arranged (10-12) to emit pulses in a pseudo-random rhythm.
System according to one of claims 1 and 2, in which the emitting
means (2) are arranged to modulate the duration of the pulses according

to data (19) to be transmitted and thus to form a descending connection
for the mobile (1) to the localisation station (21).
System according to one of claims 1 to 3, in which the emitting
means (2) comprise a laser diode (3).
System according to claim 4, in which means (13-15) are planned
to module the intensity of the luminous pulses of the laser diode (3).
System according to one of claims 1 to 5, in which the
synchronisation means (27) are arranged to command, for the duration

of one of the pulses, the supply of several images (24) to visualisation
means (23) of the operating means.
