<ABSTRACT>
The present invention relates to multilayered, heat-sealable, recycled film comprising at least one scrap layer, a heat-sealable layer and an accompanying layer which is arranged either between the scrap layer and the heat-sealable layer or on the outside on the side facing away from the heat-sealable layer, where     - the film is thermoformable, - the scrap layer comprises polyamide (nylon)/polyolefin recyclate and an adhesion promoter, where the recyclate content in the scrap layer is from 60 to 98% by weight and the adhesion-promoter content is from 2 to 40% by weight, - the recyclate has a polyamide content of from 3 to 45% by weight, and - the heat-sealable layer has a single- or multilayer structure and comprises polyolefinic polymer or copolymer, where the layers can be identical or different, - the accompanying layer comprises polyamide, polyolefin, EVOH and/or adhesion promoter or an adhesion-promoter mixture

A multilayer sealable recycled film comprising at
least one scrap layer, one sealing layer and one

accompanying layer disposed either between the scrap
layer and the sealing layer or externally on the side

remote from the sealing layer, characterised in that

the film is deep-drawable,
the scrap layer consists of recycled polyamide/polyolefin
and a primer, the proportion of

recycled material in the scrap layer being 60 to
98 wt.% and the proportion of primer being 2 to

40 wt.%,
the recycled material contains 3 to 45 wt.% of
polyamide,
the sealing layer is in one or more layers and
consists of polyolefinic polymer or copolymer,

the layers optionally being the same or
different, and
the accompanying layer is of polyamide,
polyolefin EVOH and/or primer or primer mixture.
A film according to claim 1, characterised in that the
film is produced by adhesive lamination, extrusion,

co-extrusion, extrusion coating and/or extrusion
lining, the film optionally containing additional

intermediate layers of primer. 
A film according to claims 1 and 2, characterised in
that the polyolefinic polymer or copolymer in the

sealing layer is a polyethylene, polypropylene,
polypropylene copolymer, ethylene/vinyl acetate

copolymer, ethylene/acrylic acid copolymer, ethylene/methylene
acrylic acid copolymer or ionomer or a blend

of the aforementioned polymers.
A film according to claims 1 to 3, characterised in
that the recycled material is regenerated,

regranulated or agglomerated on the basis of
polyamide/polyolefin film waste or is a mixture of two

or three of the aforementioned recycled materials.
A film according to claims 1 to 4, characterised in
that the polyamide/polyolefin/primer mixture comprises

10 to 60 wt.%, preferably 20 to 40 wt.% of polyamide,
40 to 80 wt.%, preferably 50 to 70 wt.% of polyolefin,

and 5 to 30 wt.%, preferably 5 to 15 wt.% of primer.
A film according to claims 1 to 5, characterised in
that the polyamide consists of aliphatic polyamides

such as PA 6, PA 11, PA 12, PA 66, PA 6.66, PA 6.8,
PA 6.9, PA 6.10, PA 6.11 or PA 6.12, or a copolymer of

the monomer units therein or a mixture of the

aforementioned aliphatic polyamides.
A film according to claims 1 to 6, characterised in
that the primer is an anhydride-modified polyolefin or

an anhydride-modified ethylene/vinyl acetate
copolymer.
A film according to claims 1 to 7, characterised in
that the scrap layer makes up 20 to 80%, preferably 40

to 60% of the thickness of the film, and the sealing 
layer makes up 10 to 50%, preferably 20 to 40% and the

accompanying layer makes up 0 to 50%, preferably 10 to
30%.
A film according to claims 1 to 8, characterised in
that the film has a total thickness of 0.050 to

0.500 mm, preferably 0.080 to 0.4 mm.
A film according to claims 1 to 9, characterised in
that it has the structure: carrier layer / sandwich

layer / polyolefin / intermediate layer / polyolefin,
wherein either the sandwich layer or the intermediate

layer or both are scrap layers and the carrier layer
has the structure: polyamide / primer / polyamide / primer

or polyamide / primer or polyamide / EVOH / polyamide
or consists of one or more polyamide layers,

a primer or adhesive optionally being used for bonding
the polyamide and the sandwich layer.
A film according to claims 1 to 10, characterised in
that either the intermediate layer or the sandwich

layer is absent.
