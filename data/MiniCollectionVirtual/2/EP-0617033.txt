<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to novel dihydrobenzofuran derivatives and
herbicidal compositions containing them as active ingredients.EP-A-0 476 697 discloses uracil derivatives, their
production and use as herbicides.WO 93/14073 which is prior art under Art 54(3)
EPC for the contracting states DE, ES, FR, GB and IT
describes pyrimidin compounds useful as herbicides.It is well known that certain kinds of substituted dihydrobenzofuran
derivatives can be used as active ingredients of herbicides (see, e.g., USP 4,881,967).These compounds, however, have insufficient herbicidal activity and poor
selectivity between crop plants and weeds, and it cannot always be said that they are
satisfactory for active ingredients of herbicides.Under these circumstances, the present inventors have intensively studied
various compounds. As the result, they have found that particular kinds of dihydrobenzofuran
derivatives have excellent herbicidal activity and exhibit excellent selectivity between
crop plants and weeds, thereby completing the present invention.Thus, the present invention provides novel dihydrobenzofuran derivatives of
the formula:

wherein A is hydrogen, fluorine or chlorine; X is hydrogen, fluorine, chlorine or
bromine; Y is methyl optionally substituted with one or more halogen atoms; Z is methyl 
or amino; R1 is hydrogen or C1-C6 alkyl; and R2 is C1-C6 alkyl, C1-C6 haloalkyl,
C1-C6 hydroxyalkyl, C1-C6 alkoxy(C1-C6)alkyl, C1-C6 alkoxy(C1-C6)alkoxy(C1-C6)-alkyl,
C1-C7 acyloxy(C1-C6)alkyl, carboxyl, C1-C6 alkoxycarbonyl, C1-C6 haloalkoxycarbonyl,
C3-C6 cycloalkoxycarbonyl, C2-C6 alkynyloxycarbonyl, aminocarbonyl,
C1-C6 alkylaminocarbonyl or phenylaminocarbonyl having a phenyl group optionally
substituted with C1-C6 alkyl, C1-C6 alkoxy, C1-C6 haloalkyl, C1-C6 haloalkoxy,
halogen, nitro, cyano or C1-C6 alkylthio.For the contracting states DE, ES, FR, GB and IT
X must be different from chlorine and bromine if R1 is hydrogen and A is fluorine or chlorine.On this basis the following description relates to all designated states. In the formula (I) as depicted above, examples of the acyl group are C1-C6
alkylcarbonyl, C1-C6 haloalkylcarbonyl, C3-C6 cycloalkylcarbonyl or benzoyl, and
examples of the halogen atom are fluorine, chlorine and bromine.The present invention also provides a herbicidal composition comprising
compound (I) as an active ingredient and a method of
exterminating unfavorable weeds by applying
compound (I) to an area where the unfavorable weeds grow or will grow.The following will describe some
