<ABSTRACT>
The present invention relates to a device which makes it possible to distribute, in the form of aerosol particles, a therapeutic or cosmetic substance. The device according to the invention is of the double pouch type or of a type surmounted by a pump assembly and is characterised in that it contains a composition comprising an active substance and an inert vehicle which is one or more polydiorganosiloxanes of sufficient volatility to ensure the expulsion of the composition in the form of aerosol particles. The invention also relates to the composition intended to be used in the device.

preferably at least 1%, and
0 to 20% of fillers or additives, preferably at
least 5%.
Sprayable composition according to Claim 7,
consisting in percentage by weight of:


80 to 90% of hexamethyldisiloxane,
0.1 to 5% of therapeutic or cosmetic substance,

the manufacture of a cosmetic or pharmaceutical

product intended to be presented in the form of an
aerosol particle distributor, 
characterized in
that
 the product composition consists, in
percentage by weight, of:


75 to 95% of hexamethyldisiloxane, 
0.01 to 15% of therapeutic or cosmetic
substance,
0 to 10% of agent improving the thixotropy,
preferably at least 1%,
0 to 20% of cosmetic additives or densifying
fillers.
