<ABSTRACT>
A charging roller (42) and push plates (44) are 
spring mounted to the lid (36) of a printer. When the 

lid is closed, the plates push plungers (11) down to 
rotate crank arms (23), which open a shutter (7) in 

electrophotographic cartridge (1). This holds the 
cartridge in place and provides both a resilient, 

protective cushion for the cartridge and a pop-up action 
of the lid.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to an electrophotographic imaging 
apparatus employing a toner cartridge which is under a 
closed lid during use. With such a device the cartridge 
must be suitably positioned and held in place during 
operation while the lid is closed. Imaging devices with operative elements in the lid are 
known, as established by the following: U.S. Patent 
Nos. 3,966,316 to Pfeifer et al; 4,538,896 to Tajima et 
al; 5,047,801 to Haneda et al and 5,095,334 to Nukaya. 
The Pfeifer et al and Tajima et al patents both have in 
the lid the light source for imaging and the electrical 
charging source for a photoconductor, and both have 
elements in the lid which physically interact to 
position removable members in the printer. This 
interaction, however, is by positioning rollers, while 
the interaction of the present invention is by a 
resiliently mounted pressure member. The Haneda et al 
and Nukaya patents have an electrical charging source 
and paper feed elements in the lid and removable 
printing elements on which the lid closes, and have 
nothing similar to the resiliently mounted pressure 
member of this invention. Viewed from one aspect the present invention provides an 
imaging apparatus comprising a removable cartridge 
containing toner, a photoconductive member and a shutter 
covering said photoconductive member when closed, a 
movable lid for said imaging apparatus carrying an 
optical member to selectively expose said 
photoconductive member and a charging member to 
electrically charge said photoconductive member, a 
biased push plate pivotally attached to said lid, a  
 
plunger resiliently mounted on said apparatus separate 
from said cartridge and positioned to contact said push 
plate as said lid closes, a pivotally mounted first 
crank arm pivotally connected to said plunger, and a 
second crank arm pivotally mounted on said cartridge and 
connected to said shutter to open and close said 
shutter, said first crank arm being located to rotate 
said second crank arm to open said shutter when said lid 
closes on said plunger. A preferred form of the present invention has a charging 
roller mounted in the lid on spring members, as well as 
the optical element in the lid. The lid also carries 
pivoted, spring biased push plates on opposite sides. 
The main body of the printer receives a toner cartridge 
immediately under the location of the closed lid which 
has plunger rods positioned under the spring biased 
plates and pivotally attached to crank arms. The 
cartridge has an upper

<CLAIMS>
1. An imaging apparatus comprising a removable 
cartridge (1) containing toner, a photoconductive member 

(9) and a shutter (7) covering said photoconductive 
member when closed, a movable lid (36) for said imaging 

apparatus carrying an optical member (40) to selectively 
expose said photoconductive member and a charging member 

(42) to electrically charge said photoconductive member, 
a biased push plate (44) pivotally attached to said lid, 

a plunger (11) resiliently mounted on said apparatus 
separate from said cartridge and positioned to contact 

said push plate as said lid closes, a pivotally mounted 
first crank arm (20) pivotally connected to said 

plunger, and a second crank arm (23) pivotally mounted 
on said cartridge and connected to said shutter to open 

and close said shutter, said first crank arm being 
located to rotate said second crank arm to open said 

shutter when said lid closes on said plunger. 
2. Apparatus as claimed in claim 1, in which said 
charging member (42) is a spring mounted roller. 
3. Apparatus as claimed in claim 1 or 2, in which said 
push plate (44) is spring mounted with a spring (48) of 

force such as not to yield while said first crank arm 
(20) rotates said second crank arm (23) to open said 

shutter (7) and then to yield as said lid (36) is 
further closed. 
4. A removable toner cartridge (1) for an imaging 
apparatus having a photoconductor member (9) and a 

moveable shutter (7) covering said photoconductor member 
in one position, said cartridge having a two crank arms 

(23) each pivotally connected to said cartridge on 
opposite sides of said shutter, each said crank arm 

having a first portion (24) pivotally connected to said 
 

shutter on one side of said pivot (28) to said cartridge 
and a second portion (30) having an abutment surface 

(32) extending toward said cartridge for rotating said 
crank on the other side of said pivot to said cartridge, 

said first portion being arc-shaped extending generally 
from said pivot to said cartridge toward said shutter 

and then extending generally toward said pivotal 
connection (26) to said shutter. 
6. An imaging apparatus for receiving a removable 
toner cartridge (1) to form a complete imaging apparatus 

having a lid (36) on which is mounted a light source 
(40) for imaging a photoconductor member (9) in said 

cartridge when said lid is closed, a charge roller (42) 
for contacting and charging said photoconductor member 

when said lid is closed, said charge roller being 
resiliently mounted to form a firm contact with said 

photoconductor member when said lid is closed, a push 
plate (44) resiliently mounted on said lid independent 

of said mounting of said charge roller, and a plunger 
(11) mounted in said assembly and located to contact 

said push plate as said lid is closed. 
7. Apparatus as claimed in claim 6, in which said push 
plate (44) is pivotally mounted with a spring (48) of 

force such as not to yield while said plunger (11) moves 
a first distance and to then yield as said lid (36) is 

further closed.
