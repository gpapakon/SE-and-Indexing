<ABSTRACT>
A vibration-sensing gyro (10) composed of a light alloy such 
as duralumin includes a base (12) and a pair of tines (14,16) 

projecting parallel to each other from the base (12). Piezoelectric 
elements (20) are mounted on the root of the side faces of the 

first tine (14) to excite the first tine (14) along an X axis. The 
vibrations of the first tine (14) along the X axis are then 

propagated to the second tine (16) to vibrate the second tine (16) 
along the X axis. Piezoelectric elements (24) are mounted on the 

root of the upper and the lower faces of the second tine (16) to 
detect vibrations of the second tine (16) along an Y axis. When 

the second tine (16) receives the Coriolis force based on an 
angular velocity ω around a Z axis and vibrates along the Y axis, 

the vibrations along the Y axis are detected as electric signals 
(alternating current voltages) by piezoelectric effects of the 

piezoelectric elements (24).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a vibration-sensing gyro
having a pair of tines.Vibration-sensing gyros make the tines vibrate along a
predetermined direction and detect the angular velocity in the
following manner.In the following description, it is assumed that a tine
vibrates along an X axis in the plane which contains rectangular
coordinate axis (X-Y plane). When the tine vibrating along the X
axis rotates around a Z axis perpendicular to the X-Y plane, the
angular velocity generates the Coriolis force acting on the tine
along a Y axis. The Coriolis force depends upon the angular
velocity. The angular velocity acting on the tine can accordingly
be determined by measuring the Coriolis force indirectly as a
distortion of the tine or directly using the piezoelectric effects
of piezoelectric elements. A vibration-sensing gyro having a pair
of tines as a tuning fork has been proposed in INTERNATIONAL
LAYING-OPEN GAZETTE W090/10196.Such a vibration-sensing gyro is mounted on a vehicle to
detect the yaw rate generated in turning the vehicle or record the
running conditions of the vehicle. The vibration-sensing gyro proposed in INTERNATIONAL LAYING-OPEN
GAZETTE W090/10196, however, has the following drawbacks. The
tines are composed of quartz crystal, and both an electrode for
excitation and driving and an electrode for detecting the yaw rate
are formed on each tine. These two electrodes have different
purposes and thereby different electrode patterns. Each tine
accordingly requires plural electrode patterns and thereby has a
relatively complicated electrode structure, which makes the process
or work for producing the electrodes rather complicated. Wirings
leading to the respective electrodes should be arranged on one tine
to prevent interference of each wiring with the other electrode.
This naturally requires unfavorably complicated work and process
for formation of the wirings.Each tine should have dimensions to allow the plural
electrodes to be simultaneously formed thereon, which makes the
entire vibration-sensing gyro rather bulky.In order to prevent interference of the wirings with the
electrodes, only the thin wirings can be formed on the tine having
the space for the plural electrodes. This unfavorably limits the
voltages applicable onto the excitation electrode.A large distortion is generated on the root of a tine during
vibrations of the tine. It is accordingly preferable that both the
excitation electrode and the vibration detecting electrode (electrode
for detecting the yaw rate) are formed on
