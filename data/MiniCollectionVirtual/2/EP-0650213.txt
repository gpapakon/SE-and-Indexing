<ABSTRACT>
An antenna array is adapted to handle an increased 
power of high frequency signal. The antenna array includes 

a substrate (1), a plurality of unit wiring patterns, each 
being consisted of a superconductor film (4) wiring pattern 

formed on a common plane to a major plane of the substrate 
and a non-linear element formed within each of the unit 

wiring pattern, the non-linear element being connected to an 
antenna pattern for radiating and absorbing high frequency 

electromagnetic field at one end and to a signal 
transmission path pattern at the other end. Each of the 

unit wiring pattern is connected to a signal detection means 
through a plurality of signal transmission path patterns.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an array antenna
including non-linear elements active at a temperature lower
than or equal to liquid nitrogen temperature in respective
unit elements and having a frequency transforming means
(frequency mixing) arranged in a form of an array.In seeking for application of superconductor in
electronic devices, it is important to effectively utilize
low conductivity of the superconductor. Even in the
superconductor having zero direct current resistance or the
superconductor which has lower resistance in comparison with
normal conductor, a high frequency resistance is not always
superior to the normal conductor. This is because that
while the high frequency resistance of the superconductor is
proportional to square of the frequency, the high frequency
resistance of the normal conductor is proportional to 1/2
power of the frequency. In the high frequency range,
especially at a frequency range higher than or equal to
several tens GHz, a resistance of a superconductor transfer
path becomes large to require some measure in circuit
construction. (see Piel et al., "High Temperature
Superconductors in High Frequency Fields-Fundamentals and
Applications, Proceeding of the 4th International Symposium
on Superconductivity, October, 1991, Tokyo, pp 925). In an
example of a patch array antenna an electromagnetic wave
received by antenna, a narrow but long signal transmission
line (hereinafter referred to as feed line) is employed for
transferring electromagnetic wave to a signal detecting
portion in the case of the patch array antenna, in which
patches serving as antenna elements of the patch array
antenna are arranged. The total length of the portion of
the feed line is inherently proportional to number of the
patches provided in the array to increase resistance loss in 
the feed line portion. Therefore, the signal intensity at
the signal detecting portion is not increased in proportion
to the increased number of patch to lower effect of the
array form arrangement of the patches. Therefore, there are
a plurality of proposals for feeding the signal received by
antenna to the signal detecting portion with maintaining
sufficient signal intensity. In the proposals, it has been
proposed to interpose a semiconductor amplifier at the
intermediate position of the feed line or to form the feed
line portion of a superconductor or an optical cable having
lesser resistance.For example, A. Balasubramaniyan, et al. "An Eight
MOSFET periodic Spatial Power Combiner" 1993 IEEE MTT-S
Digest, pp 811
