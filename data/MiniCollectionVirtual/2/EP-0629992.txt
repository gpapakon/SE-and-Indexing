<ABSTRACT>
An ultrasonic probe including one or more piezoelectric ceramic elements mounted on an acoustically 
damping support body. Desired acoustic signals are transmitted and received through a front portion 

of the probe while unwanted acoustic signals are dampened by the support body at the rear portion of 
the probe. The present invention generates and efficiently focusses a main lobe of a beam of the 

acoustic signals. Furthermore, the invention provides for apodization of the acoustic beam to reduce 
extraneous acoustic signals corresponding to side lobes of the acoustic beam. Each element has a 

respective rear face and a respective first piezoelectric ceramic layer (502; 1002; 1402; 1502; 1902; 2002; 
2102; 2202) integral therewith to provide efficient acoustic coupling between the element and the 

acoustically damping support body. The respective first piezoelectric layer of each element includes 
shallow grooves (505; 1005; 1905; 2005; 2105; 2205) disposed on the respective rear face of each 

piezoelectric element. A groove volume fraction of the piezoelectric layer is selected to control acoustic 
impedance of the first piezoelectric layer. Apodization of the beam is effected by varying the groove 

volume fraction of the first piezoelectric layer along an acoustic aperture of each element in accordance 
with a suitable apodization function. In accordance with a focussing function, a groove volume fraction 

of a respective second piezoelectric layer (1412) integral with each element is varied along the acoustic 
aperture, thereby effecting focussing of the acoustic beam. Electrodes extend into and contact the 

grooves, imposing electrical boundary requirements that support a desired electrical field distribution 
within the element.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention generally relates to ultrasonic probes and more specifically to ultrasonic 
probes for acoustic imaging. Ultrasonic probes provide a convenient and accurate way of gathering information about various 
structures of interest within a body being analyzed. In general, the various structures of interest have 
acoustic Impedances that are different than an acoustic impedance of a medium of the body 
surrounding the structures. In operation, such ultrasonic probes generate a beam of broadband 
acoustic waves that is then coupled from the probe, though a lens, and Into the medium of the body 
so that the acoustic beam is focussed by the lens and transmitted into the body. As the focussed 
acoustic beam propagates through the body, part of the signal Is reflected by the various structures 
within the body and then received by the ultrasonic probe. By analyzing a relative temporal delay and 
intensity of the reflected acoustic waves received by the probe, a spaced relation of the various 
structures within the body and qualities related to the acoustic impedance of the structures can be 
extrapolated from the reflected signal. For example, medical ultrasonic probes provide a convenient and accurate way for a physician 
to collect imaging data of various anatomical parts, such as heart tissue or fetal tissue structures within 
a body of a patient. In general, the heart or fetal tissues of interest have acoustic impedances that are 
different than an acoustic impedance of a fluid medium of the body surrounding the tissue structures. 
In operation, such a medical probe generates a beam of broadband acoustic waves that Is then 
acoustically coupled from a front portion of the probe, through an acoustic lens, and into the medium 
of the patient's body, so that the beam is focussed and transmitted into the patient's body. Typically, 
this acoustic coupling is achieved by pressing the front portion of the probe having the lens mounted 
thereon into contact with a surface of the abdomen of the patient. Alternatively, more invasive means 
are used, such as inserting the front portion of the probe into the body through a catheter. As the acoustic signal propagates through the patient's body, part of the acoustic beam is 
weakly reflected by the various tissue structures within the body and received by the front portion of the 
ultrasonic medical probe. By analyzing a relative temporal delay and intensity of the weakly reflected 
waves, an imaging system extrapolates an image from the weakly reflected
