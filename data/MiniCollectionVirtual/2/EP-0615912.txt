<ABSTRACT>
The transport and packaging container has a bottom (2, 2') with sides (3, 4) and a lid (11). The sides (3, 4) are connected to one another in each case by an edge connector (7 to 9). The edge connectors (7 to 9) can be removed upwards easily and quickly from the sides (3, 4). The container can then be folded together to a small volume, the sides (3, 4) being placed on the bottom (2, 2'). This basic body (1) can be stored, together with the edge connectors (7 to 9), in the lid (11) and returned by the end user to a retailer for storage. The container is suitable as a reusable package and for concepts to avoid waste.
