<ABSTRACT>
Assembly of two metal sheets (15, 17) bearing against each other, one of which belongs to a structure including, substantially perpendicular to the contact surface, a fold (12) which has an edge (13) substantially parallel to this surface and distant from it. The contacting metal sheets are pierced with an orifice (18, 19) and an assembly key (1) has a first branch (3) intended to pass through the orifices (18, 19) to stretch out on each side of the two assembled metal sheets (15, 17) and, in an active position, form an elastic member for clamping these metal sheets against each other and a second branch (7) for interacting with the free edge (13) of the abovementioned fold (12) in order to keep the first branch (3) in its active position through the orifices (18, 19).

Assembly of two metal sheets (15, 17) bearing 
against one another, one of which belongs to a structure 

comprising, substantially perpendicular to the contact 
surface, a fold (12) which has an edge (13) substantially 

parallel to said surface and remote from the latter, 
characterised in that the metal sheets in contact are 

pierced by an opening (18, 19) and in that said assembly 
comprises an assembly key (1) having a first branch (3) 

intended to pass through the openings (18, 19) so as to 
extend from one side to the other of the two assembled 

metal sheets (15, 17) and to form, in an active position, 
a resilient element locking said metal sheets against one 

another, and a second branch (7) to interact with the free 
edge (13) of the abovementioned fold (12) in order to 

secure and to hold the first branch (3) in its active 
position through the openings (18, 19). 
Assembly according to Claim 1, characterised in 
that the first branch (3) of the key comprises, on either 

side of a mid section (4) and substantially perpendicular 
to the latter, two end sections (5, 6) which, viewed from 

the side, are remote from one another by a value (d) which 
is less than the sum of the thickness of each metal sheet 

which the key (1) is intended to assemble. 
Assembly according to Claim 2, characterised in 
that the width of the end section (6) of the branch (3) 

adjacent to the second branch (7) is greater than the width 
of at least opening (19), which, in turn, is more than the 

width of the other sections (4, 5) of said first branch 
(3). 
Assembly according to one of Claims 1 to 3, 
characterised in that the second branch (7) of the key 

forms a bracing leg elastically deformed between the metal 
sheet (17) and the fold (12) belonging to the same  

 
structure (11). 
Assembly according to Claim 4, characterised in 
that the second branch (7) has an end section (10) in the 

shape of a gutter for latching thereof by straddling the 
edge (13) of the abovementioned fold (12). 
Assembly according to any one of the preceding 
claims, characterised in that the key (1) is produced from 

a folded strip of resilient metallic material.
