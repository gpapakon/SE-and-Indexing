<ABSTRACT>
Neurotransmission by excitatory amino acids (EAAs) such as glutamate is 
mediated via membrane-bound surface receptors. DNA coding for one family of 

the kainate-binding type of EAA receptor, has now been isolated and the receptor 
protein characterized. Herein described are recombinant cell lines which produce 

the EAA receptor as a heterologous membrane-bound product. Also described 
are related aspects of the invention, which are of commercial significance. 

Included is use of the cell lines as a tool for discovery of compounds which 
modulate EAA receptor stimulation.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to applications of recombinant DNA technology in the
field of neurobiology. More particularly, the invention relates to the cloning and
expression of DNA coding for excitatory amino acid (EAA) receptors, especially
human EAA receptors.In the mammalian central nervous system (CNS), the transmission of nerve
impulses is controlled by the interaction between a neurotransmitter substance
released by the "sending" neuron which then binds to a surface receptor on the
"receiving" neuron, to cause excitation thereof. L-glutamate is the most abundant
neurotransmitter in the CNS, and mediates the major excitatory pathway in
vertebrates. Glutamate is therefore referred to as an excitatory amino acid (EAA)
and the receptors which respond to it are variously referred to as glutamate
receptors, or more commonly as EAA receptors.Using tissues isolated from mammalian brain, and various synthetic EAA
receptor agonists, knowledge of EAA receptor pharmacology has been refined
somewhat. Members of the EAA receptor family are now grouped into three
main types based on differential binding to such agonists. One type of EAA
receptor, which in addition to glutamate also binds the agonist NMDA (N-methyl-D-aspartate),
is referred to as the NMDA type of EAA receptor. Two other
glutamate-binding types of EAA receptor, which do not bind NMDA, are named
according to their preference for binding with two other EAA receptor agonists,
namely AMPA (Î±-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-isoxazole-4-propionate),and kainate
(2-carboxy-4-(1-methylethenyl)-3-pyrrolidineacetate). Particularly, receptors
which bind glutamate but not NMDA, and which bind with greater affinity to
kainate than to AMPA, are referred to as kainate type EAA receptors. Similarly,
those EAA receptors which bind glutamate but not NMDA, and which bind
AMPA with greater affinity than kainate are referred to as AMPA type EAA
receptors.The glutamate-binding EAA receptor family is of great physiological and
medical importance. Glutamate is involved in many aspects of long-term
potentiation (learning and memory), in the development of synaptic plasticity, in
epileptic seizures, in neuronal damage caused by ischemia following stroke or
other hypoxic events, as well as in other forms of neurodegenerative processes. 
However, the development of therapeutics which modulate these processes has
been very difficult, due to the lack of any homogeneous source of receptor
material with which to discover selectively binding drug molecules, which interact
specifically at the
