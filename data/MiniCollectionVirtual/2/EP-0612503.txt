<ABSTRACT>
A universally applicable device for collecting cells 
or other biological material for examination thereof comprises 

a handle (1) having on one of its ends a carrier (2) with cell 
receiving means (4). The cell receiving means comprises 

substantially parallel plastic bristles (4) together forming a 
brush head (3) and one end of which being fixed on the carrier. 

The bristles are positioned such that the cross dimensions of 
the brush head is substantially equal in all directions.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a universally 
applicable device for collecting cells or other biological 
material for examination thereof, comprising a handle having 
on one of its ends a carrier with cell receiving means. The only embodiment of such a device which has 
reached practice is the cotton bud in which a wooden, plastic 
or metal stick carries a cotton tip as cell receiving means. 
This cotton tip has the disadvantage that humid cells are 
absorbed within the cotton and are not easily delivered again. 
Furthermore, the tip can sometimes fully or partially stay 
behind in the cell collecting spot where it can give rise to 
inflammations and in case it stays behind in body cavities, 
such as the urethra, the remainders in some cases can only be 
removed by surgery. In the literature several alternatives are proposed 
which, however, have still not resulted in a practically 
suitable and reliable cell collecting device. It is therefore the object of the present invention 
to provide a universally applicable cell collecting device in 
which the problems described above are removed in an effective 
way. To obtain this object the device of the type 
mentioned in the preamble is characterized according to the 
invention in that the cell receiving means comprises 
substantially parallel plastic bristles together forming a 
brush head and one end of which being fixed on the carrier, 
the bristles being positioned such that the cross dimensions 
of the brush head is substantially equal in all directions. By using plastic bristles, wet or humid cells are not 
absorbed so that they can easily be delivered again in order 
to be examined. Furthermore, the shape of the brush head makes 
the device suitable for various uses, both in cavities and on 
the body surface. Of course a circular outer circumference of 
the carrier and brush offers the best possibilities for 
universal application, but it is also conceivable that said 
shapes are slightly adapted for different purposes and 
consequently also include oval, square or similar shapes.  To further improve the cell receipt capacity it is 
favourable if the cross-section of at least a part of the 
bristles include a larger and smaller dimension, and wherein 
the larger dimension is orientated in circumferential 
direction of the brush head, of which in the preferred 
embodiment the bristles include two scraping edges positioned 
on the tangential sides of the bristles as seen in relation to 
the rotational axis of the device. In this embodiment, the

comprising a handle (1) having on one of its ends a carrier 
(2) with cell receiving means (4), characterized in that the 

cell receiving means (4) comprises substantially parallel 
plastic bristles (4) together forming a brush head (3) and one 

end of which being fixed on the carrier (2), the bristles 
being positioned such that the cross dimensions of the brush 

head (3) is substantially equal in all directions. 
Device according to claim 1, wherein the brush 
head (3) and the carrier (2) are of substantially round cross-section. 
Device according to claim 1 or 2, wherein the 
bristles (4) are uniformly distributed over the carrier (2) in 

circumferential direction. 
Device according to claim 1, 2 or 3, wherein the 
cross-section of at least a part of the bristles (4) include a 

larger and smaller dimension, and wherein the larger dimension 
is orientated in circumferential direction of the brush head 

(3). 
Device according to claim 4, wherein the bristles 
positioned on the circumference of the brush head (3) are of 

such cross-section that they form a substantially smooth 
cylinder-shaped outer circumference of the brush head (3).

wherein the outer circumference of the brush head (3) defined 

by the bristles (4) is conical from the carrier (2) towards 
the free end. 
Device according to claim 6, wherein the cross 
centre of the carrier (2) is without bristles (4). 
Device according to one of the preceding claims, 
wherein the bristles (4''') positioned on the outer 

circumference of the brush head (3) are thinner and shorter 
than the other bristles (4'' and 4'). 
Device according to one of the preceding claims, 
wherein the bristles (4) include at least one longitudinal 

scraping edge (5). 
Device according to one of claims 4 or 5 and 9, 
wherein the bristles (4) include two scraping edges (5) 

positioned on the tangential sides of the bristles as seen in 
relation to the rotational axis of the device. 
Device according to claim 10, wherein the bristles 
(4) are symmetrically in relation to a respective radial line 

of the brush head (3). 
Device according to claim 10 or 11, wherein the
