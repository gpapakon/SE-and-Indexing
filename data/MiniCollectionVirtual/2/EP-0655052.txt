<ABSTRACT>
Provided is a process for preparing 2,5-diphenylterephthalic acid, which is useful in preparing certain polyesters, especially liquid-crystalline polyesters. In this process, p-xylene is di-alkylated with cyclohexene to provide 2,5-dicyclo-hexyl-p-xylene, which is in turn dehydrogenated to provide 2,5-diphenylxylene. 2,5-Diphenylxylene is then oxidized to provide 2,5-diphenylterephthalic acid by utilization of a cobaltous/manganous/bromide oxidation system.

<DESCRIPTION>
 Process for preparing 2,5-d.phenylterephthallc add.This invention belongs to the field of synthetic organic chemistry. In particular, the present invention relates to a method for preparing 2,5—diphenyl¬ terephthalic acid.It is known that 2,5—diphenylterephthalic acid is useful as a monomer in the preparation of liquid- crystalline polyesters. U.S. Patent No. 3,365,425, describes polyesters prepared from ethylene glycol, terephthalic acid, and an asymmetrically substituted phthalic acid selected from 2,5—diphenylterephthalic acid, 4,6-diphenylisophthalic acid, and 5—t—butyliso— phthalic acid. In this patent, the 2,5-diphenyltere- phthalic acid is prepared by treatment of p—xylene with cyclohexene in the presence of A1C13 to provide 2,5— dicyclohexy—p—xylene, which is then dehydrogenated over 5% Pd/C and oxidized with KMn04. (See also, F. Ebel and . Deuschel, Chem. Ber., 89, 2794 (1956) and E. K. eisburger and J. H. eisburger, J. Orq. Chem.. 23, 1193 (1958).)The present invention provides a process for preparing 2,5—diphenylterephthalic acid, which is useful in preparing certain polyesters, especially liquid— crystalline polyesters. In this process, p—xylene is di—alkylated with cyclohexene to provide 2,5—dicyclo¬ hexy1—p—xylene, which is in turn dehydrogenated to provide 2,5—diphenylxylene. 2,5—Diphenylxylene is then oxidized to provide 2,5—diphenylterephthalic acid utilizing a cobalt/manganese/HBr oxidation system. The present invention provides a process for preparing 2,5—diphenylterephthalic acid, optionally substituted with one group selected from C,—CI0 alkyl, 

halo, nitro, or a group of the formula —C02R4 or —OR4, wherein R4 is Cj-C, alkyl; which comprises(a) di-alkylation of a compound of the formulawherein R3 is hydrogen , Cj— C10 alkyl , halo , nitro , or a group of the formula — C02R4 or -OR4, wherein R4 is Cj— C4 alkyl ; with cyclohexene in the presence of an acid catalyst , to provide a compound of the formulawherein R1 is cyclohexyl; followed by(b) dehydrogenation to provide a compound of the formula
 wherein R2 is phenyl; followed by(c) oxidation in the presence of air or oxygen and a cobaltous bromide oxidation catalyst system, at a temperature of about 75°C to 250°C, and at a pressure of about 10 to 1000 psig.In the above process step (a) , the acid catalyst may be selected from a variety of acids including, for 

example, phosphoric acid, sulfuric acid, methanesulfonic acid, trifluoromethanesulfonic acid, polyphosphoric acid, acidic molecular sieves, Si02/Al203, p—toluenesul— fonic
