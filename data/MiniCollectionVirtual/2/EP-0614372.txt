<DESCRIPTION>
This invention provides for a purified
composition containing
cellular factor
designated CD8+ cell antiviral factor [CAF]. This cell
factor is secreted by activated CD8+ T-cells. The factor
is suitable for inhibiting the replication of human
immunodeficiency virus [HIV] and related retroviruses in
infected mammals.CAF activity has been described in an unpurified and
complex medium. The medium has been demonstrated to
inhibit HIV replication in vitro. No reference known to
the inventors has demonstrated that a single, unique and
novel cell-secreted factor is responsible for this
antiviral activity. Walker, C.M. and Levy, J.A., 1989, A

CD8+ Lymphocytes can Control HIV Infection in Vitro by

1986. Similarly, J.E. Brinchmann et al. Journal of AIDS, vol. 4(2),
480-488, 1991, describe cell-free supernatant from CD8+ T
cells, which has been filtered and subsequently volume-concentrated.
HIV replication studies show that activated
CD8+ T cells secrete a HIV-1-inhibitory soluble factor.
Blocking experiments using an IFN-α2 neutralizing
monoclonal antibody showed that this HIV-1-inhibitory factor
is not IFN-α2. CD8+ cell anti-HIV activity has been correlated with
a patient's clinical condition. Mackewicz, C.E. et al.,
CD8+ cell anti-HIV activity correlates with the clinical
state of the infected individual, J. Clin. Invest. 87,
1462-1466, 1991.This invention provides for a purified
composition of CD8+ cell antiviral factor being released from
activated CD8+ cells wherein said CAF in said composition is
defined by the following properties : 
cells; biologically inactivated by pH in ranges 10-12; is
acid insensitive; is insensitive to ether; is resistant to
heat of 56°C for 30 minutes; is sensitive to Leupeptin; is
resistant to trypsin treatment and does not bind to
antibodies specific for IFNα, IFNβ, IFNγ, TNFβ, IL6, IL4,
TGF-β or TNFα. CAF does not affect the activation or
proliferation of CD4+ cells and inhibits viral replication
by interfering with RNA transcription. CAF is not one of
the previously described cytokines as determined by
biologic, molecular, and serologic assays. These cytokines
include those provided in table 1. In addition, this
invention provides for a pharmaceutical
