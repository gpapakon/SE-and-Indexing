<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to driver circuits for transistor switches, 
such as those used in switched capacitor circuits or differential switched 
capacitor circuits. A part of a switched capacitor circuit is shown in Fig. 1. The 
circuit comprises a capacitor 2 which is connected to an input pin via a 
transistor switch 4 and to a reference voltage, analog ground VAG, via a 
transistor switch 6. The capacitor is connected to an output pin, which 
may be connected to the input of an operational amplifier or other 
switching stage, depending upon the application. The gate of transistor 
switch 4 is coupled to receive a switch control signal PHO and the gate 
of transistor switch 6 is connected to receive the inverse of the switch 
control signal PH1. When the switch control signal is high, capacitor 2 
is charged from the input pin. When the switch control signal is low, the 
capacitor discharges to analog ground VAG. When the transistor switch 4 is 'on', the voltage on its gate is 
fixed, but the voltage on its drain and source is changing according to 
the signal VINP at the input pin. This means that the resistance 
between the source and drain of the transistor switch 4 (hereinafter the 
source-drain on-resistance) also varies according to the input signal. 
Thus, the RC constant, during charging of the capacitor 2, is changing 
according to the input signal VINP. This can produce non-linear 
distortions. Such distortions are particularly problematical in mixed-signal 
integrated circuits (ICs): that is, ICs that process both analog and digital 
signals. The analog parts of such ICs operate in extremely noisy digital 
environments, due to the digital noise and voltage spikes which 
penetrate to the analog part and which are rapidly changing. Since the 
RC constant depends on the input signal, the sampled spike voltage on 
the capacitor also depends on the input signal. Hence the voltage on 
capacitor 2 depends non-linearly on the input signal, which results in 
non-linear distortions. In some designs, the transistors 4 and 6 are replaced by a double 
transfer gate, in order to provide a larger input voltage range. However,  
 
the on-resistance of the double transfer gate also depends on the input 
signal, and thus, the same problems exists. In some chips, a charge pump is used to generate a gate-to-source 
voltage for the transistor switch, which is substantially independent of 
the input signal. This ensures that the on-resistance of the transistor 
switch is substantially constant (neglecting the
