<ABSTRACT>
In a colour field test where the field background is 
of a first colour -- preferably yellow -- and the illuminating 

spot (16) is of a second and different colour -- preferably blue, a 
translucent occluder (O) is utilized for the eye. The translucent 

occluder (O) is chosen to permit entry of light having the colour 
of the background -- here yellow -- while filtering out 

substantially all light of the spot colour -- here blue. There 
results the ability to conduct a field test in colour where 

retinal rivalry interference with the test is held to a 
minimum.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to field tests for testing
the peripheral vision of the human eye. More specifically, a
method and apparatus is disclosed for conducting a field test
on one eye utilizing a first color background with a
superimposed and different second color stimulus testing the
eye's peripheral vision. The improvement relates to the non-tested
eye, this eye being occluded in the first color
background to avoid the effects of retinal rivalry.This invention relates to the survey of the
peripheral field of vision of the human eye utilizing an
instrument known as a visual field tester.A visual field tester surveys the sensitivity of a
patient's retina. In what is called a static threshold test,
a spot of light, termed the stimulus, is projected to a
hemispherical projection screen for a short period of time. A
patient viewing the hemispherical projection screen from the
center of the sphere fixates along a line of sight to a
fixation light source mounted on the surface of the bowl. The
point of projection on the hemispherical projection screen is
changed in a controlled fashion from one point to another in a
predetermined pattern of points spaced apart from the fixation
point. The intensity of light at a point varies from
presentation to presentation in a controlled fashion.
Preferably, the point is varied in intensity as the point
moves from position to position on the hemispherical
projection screen. A subjective determination is made by the
patient in depressing a response button, if the stimulus is
seen. By positioning the point to known locations on the
hemispherical projection screen and changing the brightness
(in a total amount of about four decades), the sensitivity of
the patient's retina is measured and mapped. It is known to provide occlusion of the non-tested
eye in "white light" field testing of the human eye. This is
necessary to ensure that the patient is only responding to
light entering the tested eye. Specifically, and from about
1984, it has been known to conduct field tests by occluding
the non-tested eye with a white light translucent patch. This
white light translucent patch furnishes the non-tested eye
with a background illumination similar to that background
illumination seen by the tested eye but destroys contrast to
the extent that the stimulus cannot be detected. This
technique has been used with the reasoning that the provision
of a white light background to the untested eye prevents
retinal rivalry from obscuring the results of the test.Retinal rivalry is a phenomenon

<CLAIMS>
Apparatus for testing the field of view of an eye of a
patient comprising means (11) for having said patient fixate

the eye being tested in a first direction, means (14) for
providing a light stimulus (16) presented to the patient at

a known location non coaxial to said first direction, means
(107) for providing an illumination of a background field,

means (30) for recording signals from said patient of
recognition of said light stimulus (16) and means (0) for

translucently occluding, excluding the non-tested eye of
said patient, characterized in that means (14) for providing

a light stimulus (16) provide said light stimulus (16) in a
first colour, said means (107) for providing an illumination

of a background field provide said background illumination
in a second colour exclusive of said first colour and said

means for translucently occluding excludes the non-tested
eye from receiving light in said first colour and transmits

light of said second colour.
Apparatus according to claim 1, characterized in that said
first colour strongly excites the short wavelength retinal

cone receptors but weakly excites the middle and long
wavelength cone receptors and that said second colour

strongly excites the middle and long wavelength retinal cone
receptors but weakly if at all excites the short wavelength

cone receptors.
Apparatus of claim 2, characterized in that said first
colour is blue and that said second colour is yellow.
