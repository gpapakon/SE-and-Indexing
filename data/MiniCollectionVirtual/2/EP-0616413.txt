<ABSTRACT>
A switching power supply for converting a mains voltage supplied by an 
electric mains into a desired output voltage comprises 
inter alia
 at least two bridge 
circuits (7), each of which comprises four branches which include switching elements 

(9) and a primary winding (19) of a transformer. Each bridge circuit (7) comprises two 
input terminals (13) which are connected to an input circuit (1). There are also provided 

coupling means which comprise a transformer core (121) which is common to at least 
two bridge circuits (7) and on which there are provided the primary transformer 

windings (19) associated with the relevant bridge circuits and a common secondary 
transformer winding (123) in such a manner that the primary transformer windings are 

rigidly coupled to one another. The input terminals (13) of the relevant bridge circuits 
(7) are electrically connected in series so that the bridge circuits together constitute a 

switching unit (33) comprising two input terminals (113). In order to increase the power 
delivered by the power supply without requiring the use of a much larger and more 

expensive transformer, there are provided at least two switching units (33) which 
comprise equal numbers of bridge circuits (7), the input terminals (113) of said 

switching units being electrically connected in parallel whereas the secondary 
transformer windings (123) associated with each of said switching units are electrically 

connected in series.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a switching power supply for converting a mains
voltage supplied by an electric mains into a desired output voltage, comprising:
a) an input circuit for converting the mains voltage into a direct voltage,b) at least two bridge circuits, each of which comprises four branches which include
switching elements with control electrodes and a primary winding of a transformer,
each of said bridge circuits comprising two input terminals which are connected to the
input circuit,c) a control circuit for generating control signals, which control circuit comprises output
terminals which are connected to the control electrodes of the switching elements,d) coupling means, comprising at least a transformer core of a soft-magnetic material,
for coupling the primary transformer windings of the bridge circuits to one another,e) an output circuit comprising at least a secondary transformer winding which is
coupled, via the transformer core, to at least one of the primary transformer windings,
the coupling means comprising a transformer core which is common to at least two
bridge circuits and on which there are provided the primary transformer windings
associated with the relevant bridge circuits and a common secondary transformer
winding in such a manner that the primary transformer windings are rigidly coupled to
one another, the input terminals of the relevant bridge circuits being electrically
connected in series so that the bridge circuits together constitute a switching unit
comprising two input terminals.A power supply of this kind is known from Philips Power Systems
Catalog 1993, pp. 22-23. The known apparatus comprises two bridge circuits whose
primary transformer windings are coupled to one another via the common transformer
core. As a result, the voltage across these transformer windings is always the same, and
hence also the input voltage of both bridge circuits. When the apparatus is connected,
via the input circuit, for example, to a three-phase mains, the direct voltage produced 
by the input circuit is comparatively high. Thanks to the fact that the input voltage of
each of the bridge circuits amounts to exactly half this high input voltage, comparatively
inexpensive standard switching elements which are not suitable for extremely high
voltages can be used in the bridge circuits. The power to be delivered by the power
supply is limited mainly by the temperature rise in the transformer. For higher powers a
larger transformer could be chosen, but the volume and cost of the power supply
