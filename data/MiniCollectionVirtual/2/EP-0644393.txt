<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a tube radiator consisting of a plurality of radiator elements which are arranged next to one another and are respectively assembled from two end pieces (1), which consist of half shells (1a, 1b) welded to one another and are provided with pipe adaptors (tube adaptors) (1d), and from a plurality of pipes (2) welded in between the end pieces (1). In order to provide a tube radiator of the type described at the beginning which can be produced economically by a low number of operations, the invention proposes that the half shells (1a, 1b) are welded to one another without burrs, preferably by laser welding, and that the pipes (2) are welded to the pipe adaptors (1d) without burrs, preferably by capacitor (condenser) discharge welding.

<CLAIMS>
Method for producing tube radiators comprising a 
plurality of adjacent radiator elements, which are in 

each case produced by welding together two half-shells 
(1a, 1b), which are provided with tube connection stubs 

(1d), to form end pieces (1) and by welding a plurality 
of tubes (2) in between the tube connection stubs (1d) of 

the end pieces (1), characterized in that the half-shells 
(1a, 1b) are welded together without flash by laser 

welding and in that the tubes (2) are welded to the tube 
connection stubs (1d) without flash by capacitor 

discharge welding.
