same as the active ingredient, wherein R¹ represents alkyl; X represents hydrogen, halogen or alkyl; n represents an 

integer of 1 to 5; Y represents halogen, nitro or alkyl; and m represents an integer of 2 to 5. This derivative has an

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to triazole derivatives,
insecticides and acaricides containing them as an active
ingredient, and methods thereof. The prior art includes compounds similar in chemical
structure to those described and claimed herein. These are
described in the following documents.Research Disclosure, 278 (1987), pp 356-357 relates to
a triazole derivative having the following general formula:

wherein R1 is a halogen substituted phenyl group or the
like, and R2 is a monohalogen substituted phenyl group such
as 2-fluorophenyl group or 2-chlorophenyl group, a dihalogen
substituted phenyl group such as 2,6-difluorophenyl group,
2-chloro-6-fluorophenyl group, and the like, and discloses
that such a compound is useful for the control of mites and
and sucking insects.An insecticidal compound is described in EP-A-0 036 711
(equivalent to JP-A-56-154464) which is characterized by
bonding a phenyl group to the 5-position of 1H-1,2,4-triazole,
but there is no description of the groups used in the
compounds of the invention to be more particularly described
below.EP-A-0 185 256 describes a compound characterized by
bonding the o-trifluoromethylphenyl group or 4-trifluoromethyl-3-pyridyl
group to the 5-position of 1H-1,2,4-triazole,
which is different from the invention to be
described hereinbelow. US-A-4 151 169 describes a process for preparing
substituted 1,2,4-triazole derivatives of the formula

wherein R and R1 are each an optionally substituted phenyl
gropups which may be the same or different except that both
may not be phenyl, and when R is phenyl, R1 is not p-chlorophenyl,
and R2 is a C1-C4 alkyl group. These compounds are
described as sedatives, hypnotics and in some cases anxiety
relieving means and there is no mention of insecticidal or
acaricidal properties at all.Chem. Abs. 80 No. 15, April 15, 1974 (No. 82270b) and
Chem. Ztg, 97 No. 11, 1973 describes compounds such as 1-methyl-3-phenyl-5-(2,4,6-trimethoxyphenyl)-1,2,4-triazole
without mentioning any insecticidal properties.EP-A-0 572 142 published after the priority date of the
present application (cited under Art. 53(4) EPC only)
relates to triazole derivatives of a chemical structure
similar to the compounds described herein and having
insecticidal and acaricidal properties.However it can not be said that the insecticidal or
acaricidal compounds described above are sufficient in
insecticidal or acaricidal activities. The inventors have synthesized various triazole
derivatives in order to develop novel and useful
insecticide and acraricide
