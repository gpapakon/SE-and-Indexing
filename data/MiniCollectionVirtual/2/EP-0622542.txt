<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a method for the detection of misfiring in internal combustion engines, the angular velocity of the crankshaft being evaluated. When misfiring is indicated, the rough running values calculated from the angular velocity of the crankshaft are also analysed for the presence of a rough section of road and only in the absence of such rough road is the misfiring confirmed.

Method for detecting combustion misfires in 
internal combustion engines, characterized in that 


the fluctuations in angular speed of the crankshaft, 
which are measured as segment time fluctuations, are used 

to calculate a lack-of-smoothness value (LU), which falls 
below a negative lack-of-smoothness limit value (LU_SCHW) 

if a combustion misfire is present 
and in that if the lack-of-smoothness value (LU) falls 
below the lack-of-smoothness limit value (LU_SCHW) 
successively calculated lack-of-smoothness values are 
used to calculate a value (DVSLU) for a stretch of bad 

road, which latter falls below or is equal to a positive 
limit value (SWS_SCHW) for a stretch of bad road, if a 

stretch of bad road is present, 
and in that if the value (DVSLU) for a stretch of bad 
road falls below the limit value (SWS_SCHW) for a stretch 

of bad road or is of equal magnitude to this limit value, 
the previously indicated combustion misfire is not 

confirmed, but 
in that the previously indicated combustion misfire is 
confirmed if the value (DVSLU) for a stretch of bad road 

exceeds the limit value (SWS_SCHW) for a stretch of bad 
road. 
Method according to Claim 1, characterized in 
that the value (DVSLU) for a stretch of bad road is 

calculated 

by adding together successively calculated lack-of-smoothness 
values (LU) to form a sum, 
reducing this sum (SLU) by the largest (LU1G) and 
smallest (LU1K) of the lack-of-smoothness values which  

 
have occurred during the measurement interval, if a 

combustion misfire has been indicated during the 
measurement interval, and further reducing the sum by the 

second-largest, (LU2G) and the second-smallest (LU2K) of 
the lack-of-smoothness values which have occurred during 

the measurement interval, if at least two combustion 
misfires have been indicated during the measurement 

interval and 
calculating the mean value (DVSLU) from this reduced 
sum (VSLU). 
Method according to Claim 2, characterized in 
that the number of lack-of-smoothness values to be added 

together corresponds to the number of cylinders. 
Method according to Claim 1, characterized in 
that the lack-of-smoothness limit value (LU_SCHW) is 

taken from a performance graph dependent on the operating 
variables - at least load and rpm - as a function of the 

current engine operating conditions. 
Method according to Claim 1, characterized in 
that the limit value (SWS_SCHW) for the stretch of bad 

road is taken from a performance graph dependent on the 
operating variables - at least load and rpm - as a 

function of the current engine operating conditions. 
Method according to Claim 1, characterized in 
that the limit value (SWS_SCHW) for a stretch of bad road 

is calculated from the lack-of-smoothness limit value 
(LU_SCHW). 
Method according to Claim 6, characterized in 
that the limit value (SWS_SCHW) for a stretch of bad road 

is calculated from the lack-of-smoothness limit value 
(LU_SCHW) by multiplication by a factor, preferably in a 

range of from 0 to -1. 
Method according to Claim 1, characterized in 
that the value (DVSLU) for a stretch of bad road is 

subjected to sliding averaging. 
Method according to Claim 1, characterized in 
that the method is carried out only below a 

predeterminable engine rpm.
