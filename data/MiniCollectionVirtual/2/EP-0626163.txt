<ABSTRACT>
Disclosed is a support mechanism (10) that may be installed onto 
a conventional bed and/or a hospital bed frame to assist a 

person into and out of a bed. The support mechanism comprises a 
tubular support member (22) formed with a pair of vertical and 

substantially parallel legs (24, 26), each of which is adapted 
to fasten to a side rail (12) of the bed frame. Preferably one 

of the vertical legs (24) is attached to the bed post (20) by a 
clamp (40).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates generally to support mechanisms and more particularly, to
a mechanism for assisting a person into and out of a bed.A support mechanism according to the preamble of
claim 1 is disclosed in US-A-3 286 283.For a variety of reasons, many people have difficulty getting into and out a
conventional bed. For example, it is not uncommon for elderly persons to use an apparatus
commonly referred to as a "walker" to move from one room of the house to another. When the
person desires to get into a conventional bed, the person typically positions the "walker" adjacent
to the bed and attempts to place themselves onto the bed by using the walker as a support. Quite
often, however, the walker will move when the person applies their weight to the walker thus
making the process of getting into bed difficult and dangerous.U.S. Patent No. 5,195,200 discloses a support apparatus which is mounted to the bottom
surface of rails 13 and 14 of a conventional bed frame 10 by a plate 20, clip members 28, and
screws 26. The apparatus further employs a tubular member 22 connected to and positioned
adjacent to plate 20 and which is adapted to receive a variety of support tubes. While providing some degree of support to a person getting into and out of bed,
apparatus of the type disclosed by U.S. Patent No. 5,195,200 have several drawbacks. In
particular, the support apparatus has numerous components which makes it cumbersome to
mount to the bed frame insomuch as it fastens to the bottom plate of two bed rails and secured
by multiple clamps and screws thereby making installation very difficult.The present invention is a support apparatus that can be easily attached to a conventional
and/or a hospital bed frame to provide a rigid support structure which may be used by a person
to get into and out of the bed. The support apparatus generally comprises a tubular support
member formed to have two legs which are attached by a bracket to the side rails of the bed
The support apparatus may further comprise a clamp designed to secure one of the legs of the
support member to the bed post. The present invention overcomes the drawbacks associated
with conventional support apparatus for beds in that it provides a solid and rigid support
structure so that a person may confidently apply their weight to the support structure as they get
into and out of the bed. Moreover, unlike conventional devices, the support apparatus of the
present invention can be easily installed onto a conventional bed and/or a hospital bed

<CLAIMS>
A support mechanism (10, 82) for assisting a person into
and out of a bed having a frame (80) including side rails

(12; 70; 76, 78), the support mechanism comprising:

a support member (22, 83) having an upper portion (32, 84)
and first and second legs (24, 26; 86, 88) adapted to

connect to a vertical extending portion (14, 76) of the
side rail (12; 70; 76, 78), 
characterized by

a
clamp (40, 48) adapted to attach an int
ermediate portion of
one of said legs (24, 88) to a bed post (20, 50).
The support mechanism of claim 1, wherein a bracket
(34; 68; 94, 96) is directly attached to each of said first

and second legs (24, 26; 86, 88), each of said brackets
(34; 68; 94, 96) having a channel (36, 37) adapted to

removably mount about the vertical extending portion
(14, 76) of the side rail (12; 70; 76, 78).
The support mechanism of claims 1 and 2, wherein said
intermediate portion of said leg (24, 88) is displaced from

said bracket (34; 68; 94, 96) of said leg (24, 88).
The support mechanism of claim 2, wherein each of said
brackets (34; 68; 94, 96) further comprises a substantially

horizontal portion (38, 100) configured to engage with a
horizontally extending portion (18, 78) of the side rail

(12; 76, 78).
The support mechanism of claim 2, wherein each said channel
(36, 72) is integrally formed with said bracket (34, 68).
The support mechanism of claim 2, wherein each of said
brackets (34; 68) is integrally formed with each of said

first and second legs (24, 26). 
The support mechanism of claim 1, including an upper
bracket (94) and a lower bracket (96), said upper and lower brackets

(94, 96) each comprising a vertically extending plate (98) and a
horizontally extending plate (100) each having a free end,

said free end of said vertically extending plate (98) of
said upper bracket (94) extends a distance below the

vertically extending side rail (76) of the frame (80) and
said free end of said horizontally extending plate (100) of

said upper bracket (94) extends a distance beyond the
horizontally extending side rail (78) of the frame (80).
The support mechanism of claim 7, wherein each of said free
ends of said vertically extending plate (98) and said

horizontally extending plate (100) of said upper or lower
brackets (94, 96) comprise a plurality of thru-holes

(116, 118, 120, 122) adapted to receive a bolt (108).
The support mechanism of claim 7 or 8, wherein said lower
bracket (96) comprises a vertically extending plate (102)

and a horizontally extending plate (104) each having a free
end and said free end of said vertically extending plate

(102) of said lower bracket (96) extends a distance below
the vertically extending side rail (76) of the frame (80)

and said free end of said horizontally extending plate
(104) of said lower bracket (96) extends a distance beyond

the horizontally extending side rail (78) of the frame
(80).
