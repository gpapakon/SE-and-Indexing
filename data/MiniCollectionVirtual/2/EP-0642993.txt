<ABSTRACT>
Pocket minicontainer, disposable and made of sheet material such as 
cardboard, aluminium, plastic or a mixture of said products, die-cut and scored for 

its bending and tridimensional conformation by the user, in various configurations, 
scored for its further folding and final closing after having introduced residues and 

waste and before it is deposited or thrown in a dustbin or appropriate container.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention refers to a hygienic pocket container 
conceived as a small item which can be easily carried, 
either alone or as part of a group from where the 
different containers can be picked out and successively 
used, the aim of which is to house under certain circumstances 
small residues such as cigarette toppers, chewing 
gum, sunflower nutshells, etc. so that instead of 
throwing them away they can be stored in such container 
and kept inside the pocket until there is a waste 
container available or any other appropriate place for 
its final disposal is found. Currently, small products basically derived from the food 
industry are broadly used. Such products entail a series 
of residues which in may cases are thrown away either in 
the street, in the beach, in the countryside or in any 
other place. Almost everybody has had the uncomfortable experience of 
stepping on a chewing gum in the street or having to 
clean nutshells away from a seat. Such residues although 
small are very annoying and anti-hygienic. Therefore, we are faced to a hygiene problem derived from 
a specific and individual consumption at any time and 
place on the part of the consumer and these products 
invariably entail residues or waste.  A specific, adequate and technical solution for such 
personal hygiene problems has not yet been found. This problem has been faced from another point of view 
which is the joint use of the different solutions 
proposed up to now which are usually fixed and not very 
specifically designed for their intended use. Such 
solutions have materialized in different types and models 
of containers which although specialized in some way - as 
in the case of the wastepaper baskets - continue following 
a joint approach, require a specific size and 
endurance and have to be located at a specific physical 
place. This traditional approach has determined that these 
solutions have a scarce or no mobility at all as in the 
case of wastepaper baskets located in the street or at 
the beach. Up to this date no practical, hygienic or individual 
solution to this hygiene need/problem has been offered. The public agencies have also tried to find a solution - 
with little success - through specific campaigns. The 
statutory bodies have also contributed to this aim by 
enacting rules to penalise those persons who throw such 
residues on the street. However, the only technical 
alternative was to disencourage their consumption on the 
part of the individuals or that such residues were kept 
by them until they

<CLAIMS>
A hygienic pocket container especially conceived to 
house small remnants or residues such as cigarette 

toppers, chewing gum, etc., keeping them duly sealed 
until their final disposal, essentially characterized 

because it is formed by a sheet (1) made of any material 
suitable for the residue to be housed inside it and, for 

this purpose, either combustible or not and/or water 
tight or not. Such sheet once it has been duly folded 

presents a small receptacle (2) with the adequate 
dimensions to keep such residues. It has been foreseen 

that the material of such sheet (1) preferably offers an 
adequate plasticity to enable the sealing of the open end 

(4) of the receptacle (2) once the residue (3) has been 
deposited inside it, by simply folding the part of the 

container close to such open end (4). 
A hygienic pocket container, according to claim 1, 
characterized because such sheet can determine different 

shapes such as a cone, a star, an arrow, a boat, a paper 
bird or any other shape adequate to any design provided 

that such ornamental element incorporates a cavity (2) 
with the appropriate dimensions to house the intended 

residue (3). 
A hygienic pocket container, according to the 
previous claims, characterized because the object defined 

by it, either a cone (1), a star (6), a pyramid (7), an 
arrow (8), a boat (9), a paper bird (10) or any other 

shape is initially flat like a sheet of a minimum volume 
the cavity (2) of which is unfolded when the container is 

going to be used. 
A hygienic pocket container, according to the 
 

previous claims, characterized because the container (1) 

can be a single element or form part of a set of similar 
containers incorporating a dispenser.
