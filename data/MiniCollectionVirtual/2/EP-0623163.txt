<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to the use of additives for improving the cold flow 
properties of crude oil or fuel oil, for example distillate petroleum fuel such as 
middle distillate fuel oil boiling within the range of 110°C to 500°C. When oils and fuel oils are subjected to low ambient temperatures, wax may 
separate out from the fuel and impair the flow properties of the oil. For example, 
middle distillate fuels contain wax which precipitates at low temperatures to form 
large waxy crystals which tend to plug the small pore openings of fuel filters. 
This problem is particularly acute when the fuel is a diesel fuel because the 
nominal apertures in the fuel filter of diesel engines are typically of diameter 
between about 5 and 50 microns. Additives are known in the art for overcoming 
the above problem and are called Flow Improvers. Such additives may act as wax crystal modifiers when blended with waxy 
mineral oil by modifying the shape and size of crystals of the wax therein and 
reducing the adhesive forces between the crystals and between the wax and the 
oil to permit the oil to remain fluid at a lower temperature than in the absence of 
the additive. Many additives are described in the art for improving the cold-flow properties of 
oils, for example in the form of oil-soluble addition products or condensates that 
may be polymeric or monomeric and as described for example, in 
US-A-3,048,479; UK-A-1,263,152; US-A-3,961,916; and EP-A-0,261,957. 
Some of the above additives have been and are used commercially as Cold 
Flow Improvers. However, there is a need to improve performance, particularly 
over a range of oils. US-A-3,850,587 describes fuel compositions comprising a middle distillate fuel 
and a flow improver composition comprising a hydrocarbyl succinic acid or 
amine salt thereof, an ethylene-vinyl acetate polymer and, optionally, an 
aromatic monocarboxylic acid. Other additives are described as optionally 
being present, one type being a demulsifier. However, the demulsifiers are not 
described as having flow improver properties.  
 In this invention, it has surprisingly been found that demulsifiers may improve the 
cold flow properties of oils and also may act synergistically in providing such 
properties when used in combination with addition products or condensates that 
themselves have cold flow improving properties. Also, the proportions of 
demulsifier that are used may be surprisingly small. A first aspect of the invention is an additive composition comprising: 
(i) one or more
