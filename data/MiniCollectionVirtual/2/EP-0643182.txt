<ABSTRACT>
In order to fasten a facing shell arranged at a distance from the supporting shell, the invention proposes an anchorage element which comprises a sleeve, which is enclosed by a sheath and is filled with a bonding composition before introduction into the bore, and an anchorage means for the displacement of the bonding composition. The anchorage means comprises a wire which can be inserted in a longitudinal groove of the plastic part in such a manner that one side of the wire remains free. The diameter of the anchorage means corresponds virtually to the diameter of the sleeve. Consequently, the bonding composition is distributed uniformly in the annular gap and, after the composition has hardened, homogeneous bonding between the bore wall and the anchorage element is achieved.

<CLAIMS>
Anchoring element for fastening an outer shell that 
is arranged spaced apart from a supporting shell, 

especially for subsequent renovation of the cladding of a 
building, which anchoring element consists of a sleeve 

that is filled with a bonding compound and of an anchoring 
means, characterized in that the sleeve (2) is 

surrounded by a tubular casing (3) and, before being 
inserted into the drilled hole (9), is filled with a 

bonding compound (7), the anchoring means (8) consists of 
a wire (11) that is set in a plastics part (12) and the 

diameter of the anchoring means (8) corresponds nearly 
to the diameter of the sleeve (2). 
Anchoring element according to claim 1, characterized 
in that a slot (13, 13a) is provided between the 

wire (11) and the plastics part (12) at both ends of the 
anchoring means (8). 
Anchoring element according to claim 1, characterized 
in that the sleeve (2) is in the form of a mesh 

sleeve. 
Anchoring element according to claim 1, characterized 
in that the portion of the plastics part (12) 

that holds the wire (11) has a surface (14) that is 
partially open. 
Anchoring element according to claim 1, characterized 
in that surface-shaping (15) is provided at both 

ends of the wire (11). 
Method for installing an anchoring element according  
 

to claim 1 in double wall masonry, characterized 
in that a sleeve (2) that is filled with a bonding 

compound (7) is introduced into the drilled hole (9) and 
that once the anchoring means (8) has been inserted into 

the sleeve (2) the bonding compound (7) is displaced into 
the annular gap (24, 24a).
