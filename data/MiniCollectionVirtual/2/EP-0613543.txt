<ABSTRACT>
An oven using one or more quartz halogen tungsten lamps or quartz arc bulbs (16, 18) capable of producing 4KW of radiant energy of which a significant portion is in the visible light range of the electromagnetic spectrum and substantially forty to fifty percent of the radiation is in the visible and near visible range impinges visible, near visible and infrared radiation directly onto a food item (32). Radiation sources (16, 18) can be positioned above and below the food item (32) and the inner walls (12) of the oven are preferably highly reflective to reflect light energy onto the food (32). The intensity of the radiation light source (16, 18) is automatically controllable and can be varied throughout the cooking cycle.

<DESCRIPTION>
 COOKING APPARATUS USING ELECTRON AND MOLECULAR EXCITATION MODECross References to Related ApplicationsThis application is a continuation-in-part of U.S. Patent application number 195,967 filed on May 19,1988, (now abandoned), a continuation-in-part of U.S. Patent application number 664,494 filed on March 5, 1991, and a continuation-in-part of U.S. Patent application number 07/350,024 filed on May 12, 1989, which are incorporated herein by reference.Field of the InventionThis invention relates to the field of cooking apparatuses. More particularly, this invention relates to baking and cooking processes that are substantially faster than such processes in conventional ovens, and offer sensory improvements in quality for many foodstuffs.Background of the InventionOvens for cooking and baking food have been known and used for thousands of years. Basically, oven types can be categorized in four different forms. The simplest and probably the oldest cooking resulted when man put some vegetable or grain products on a hot rock next to a fire, and cooked them essentially by the heat transfer method of conduction. With a little more refinement, an enclosure surrounding the heating element entrapped the heated air giving rise to cooking by convective heat transfer. This was the prototype for the modern gas or electric oven. In the past century, radiant energy from infrared radiation sources has been used to heat and cook foodstuffs directly. Within the past few decades, microwave radiation has 

 proved useful in allowing very short cooking times for many types of food.There are subtle differences between cooking and baking. Cooking just requires the heating of the food. Baking of a product from a dough, such as bread, cake, crust, or pastry, requires not only heating of the product throughout but also a chemical reaction coupled with driving the water from the dough in a predetermined fashion to achieve the correct consistency of the final product and finally browning the outside. Following a recipe when baking is very important. An attempt to decrease the baking time in a conventional oven by increasing the temperature results in a damaged or destroyed product. In general, there are problems when one wants to cook or bake foodstuffs with high-quality results in the shortest times. Conduction and convection provide the necessary quality, but both are inherently slow energy transfer methods. Infrared radiation can provide faster heating rates, but it only heats the surface area of most foodstuffs, leaving the
