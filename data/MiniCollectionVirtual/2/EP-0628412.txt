<ABSTRACT>
A method of, and a control circuit for, determining the exciting voltage to be applied to 
the nozzle of an ink jet printer to break a stream of ink into droplets for printing includes the 

steps of slowly increasing the exciting voltage from a minimum value and detecting and 
recording the value C(H) at which droplet formation first occurs closest to the nozzle. The 

exciting voltage for printing is estimated by applying electrical test patterns (Figure 6) to the 
ink droplets such that the patterns will vary in phase relative to droplet timing whereby only 

some of the test patterns will successfully charge the droplets. After that, those droplets which 
have been successfully charged are detected and the value C(H) determined from the change in 

the sequence of detected charge patterns. The exciting voltage for printing is estimated 
according to the formula 


V(est) = C(H) - E 
 
, where E is a voltage related to the performance on 

the ink.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to ink jet printing systems and similar drop marking systems in 
which a supply of electrically conductive ink is provided to a nozzle. The ink is forced through 
a nozzle orifice while at the same time an exciting voltage is applied to the nozzle to cause the 
stream of ink to break into droplets which can be charged and deflected onto a substrate to be 
marked. Such ink jet technology is well known and, for example, see U.S. Patent Nos. 
4,727,379 and 4,555,712. To ensure proper operating conditions for consistent printing quality, the exciting energy 
or voltage applied to the nozzle must be properly set during operation of the system. Presently, 
most ink jet printers require manual setting of the energy applied to the ink stream as it exits the 
nozzle. The appropriate value is either empirically determined by comparing what is seen to an 
existing diagram or by determining the drop separation point and comparing it with machine 
specifications. In either case, the resulting print quality varies. Efforts to provide automatic control of the modulation voltage have concentrated on 
detecting separation point position, relative to a fixed location, such as the charge tunnel. See, 
for example, published European patent specification EP-A-0287373. Another approach is 
disclosed in U.S. Patent No. 4,638,325 which utilizes a small charging electrode and a 
downstream electrometer by which the drop separation point can be determined by observing 
the current at the electrometer as the separation point approaches the small electrode, the  
 
maximum current being produced when drop separation is closest to the small charging 
electrode. A system control microprocessor receives the digital ink jet current signal from the 
electrometer and is programmed to control the gain of a stimulation amplifier, of which the 
output is applied to the piezoelectric transducer on the ink jet printing head, by providing a 
reference signal to an automatic gain control circuit. In operation the stimulation amplitude is 
initially adjusted to a low level to allow the length of the ink filament to approach its natural 
unstimulated length. The stimulation amplitude is then monotonically increased whilst the 
charge imparted to the ink jet is monitored by the electrometer. As the stimulation amplitude 
is increased, the ink filament becomes shorter and the ink drop separation approaches the narrow 
charging electrode. In this manner the ink jet current registered by the electrometer provides a 
signal
