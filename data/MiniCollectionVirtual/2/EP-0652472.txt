<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a silver halide
photographic material and, in particular, to that which
has been color-sensitized with a particular sensitizing
dye, which gives an image having few color stains to be
caused by dyes remained in the processed material and
which is stable during its production.In order to selectively elevate the sensitivity of
a light-sensitive silver halide emulsion to a light
falling within a particular wavelength range, employed is
a color-sensitizing technique of adding a color-sensitizing
dye to the silver halide emulsion.It is important that color-sensitizing dyes not
only have a color-sensitizing activity as their intrinsic
function but also have no photographically-harmful effect
on photographic materials. For instance,
photographically-harmful effects of color-sensitizing dyes
are such that the dyes remain in processed photographic
materials to cause color stains and that they cause
lowering of sensitivity of photographic materials or
increasing of fog in them during storing photographic
materials. Conventional improvements in color-sensitizing
dyes have eliminated many of these harmful effects, but 
further improvements in them are still desired. On the
other hand, since the adsorbability of conventional color-sensitizing
dyes onto fine silver halide crystals varies
with the lapse of time while silver halide emulsions
containing them are coated on a support to produce
photographic materials, it is often difficult to produce
photographic materials having constant photographic
properties. Therefore, it is desired to improve color-sensitizing
dyes so as to evade the difficulty.EP-A-0,331,414 discloses dyes of the formula

wherein R1 is halogen, a substituted or unsubstituted phenyl
group, or a substituted or unsubstituted styryl group,
R2 and R3 are each independently a substituted alkyl group,
a substituted alkenyl group, or a substituted aryl group
that are substituted with an anionic solubilising group,
Z represents the atoms necessary to complete a substituted
or unsubstituted naphthyl ring, and
X+ is a cation.A photographic composition comprising silver halide of at
least 80 mol% silver chloride or less than 1 mol% silver
iodide and the above sensitizing dye (I) is also disclosed. A first object of the present invention is to provide
novel sensitizing dyes.A second object of the present invention is to provide
a silver halide photographic material, of which the
photographic properties are not worsened by dyes still
remaining after processing to cause color
