<ABSTRACT>
The press section of a paper machine for thin papers has the following characteristics: a pressing gap is formed by a rotary, smooth surface (1) in contact with the paper and by a felted pressing roll (3); the smooth surface (1) transfers the paper web downstream of the pressing gap to a heatable roll (4) without free pulling of the paper web. The invention is characterised in that the smooth surface (1) is the outer surface of a tubular roll with dimensionally stiff roll sleeve.

<CLAIMS>
Press section for a papermachine for thin
papers, with the following features:


1.1 a press nip is provided which is formed
by a last press unit and which is formed by a

revolving, smooth surface in contact with the paper and
a felted press roll (3, 600);

characterized in that
1.2 the smooth surface transfers the paper
web (100) downstream of the press nip to a heated roll

(4, 5, 7, 30, 1'), avoiding a free paper draw, and in
that
1.3 the smooth surface is the outer surface
of a tubular roll with a dimensionally stable roll

cover (1).
Press section according to Claim 1,
characterized in that the felted press roll (3) is an

extended-nip press roll or a shoe-press roll.
Press section according to Claims 1 and 2,
characterized in that the smooth tubular roll (1)

upstream of the press nip forms, with a further, felted
press roll (2, 200, 300), a further pre-press nip

located upstream of the press nip from feature 1.1.
Press section according to Claim 3,
characterized in that a separate, endless felt is

provided for each of the two press nips.
Press section according to either of Claims 3
and 4, characterized in that the further felted press

roll is a shoe-press roll or an extended-nip press
roll. 
Press section according to Claim 3,
characterized in that in each case a single, common

felt (10) is provided for both press nips.
Press section according to one of Claims 3, 4
or 6, characterized that the further felted press roll

(200) is a suction roll, whose suction zone is located
predominantly upstream of the pre-press nip.
Press section according to one of Claims 1 - 7,
characterized in that the smooth tubular roll (1) is a

controlled deflection roll.
Press section according to one of Claims 1 - 8,
characterized in that the heated roll (4) is an

unfelted tubular roll which guides the web and
transfers the web to a drying cylinder, preferably

avoiding a free paper draw.
Press section according to one of Claims 1 - 9,
characterized in that the nip between the smooth

tubular roll (1) and the heated roll (30), in
particular of a drying cylinder, can be opened.
