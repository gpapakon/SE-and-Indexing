Method for transferring and logging user
task-oriented administration order program modules

(APM) formed by operational instructions from a data
processing installation (DVA) via a local area network

(LAN) to a network management centre (NMZ) which can be
connected to communication systems (KS) via a

communication network (KN), where an order management
routine (AVR) co-ordinating the processing of the

administration order program modules (APM) is provided
in the network management centre (NMZ),
characterized in that
the data processing installation (DVA) transfers the
administration order program modules (APM) to an order

file memory (AS) in the network management centre
(NMZ), and the order and communication system

information (afi, ksi) contained in an associated
update message (ai) and also an order type information

item (ati) are entered into an order book file (ABD)
provided in the network management centre (NMZ), the

respective update message (ai) of the order management
routine (AVR) indicating the respective entry in the

order book file (ABD), and
depending on the information contents of the order
type information (ati) contained in the update message

(ai) and also of the order and communication system
information (afi, ksi), the order management routine

(AVR) is used to process the stored administration
order program modules (APM) and also to enter 

processing status information (bsi) into the order book
file (ABD) on the basis of individual administration

order programs.
Method according to Claim 1,
characterized

in that
 the order type, order and communication system
information (ati, afi, ksi) contained in a further

transferred update message (ai) changes the type of
entered order processing by entering the currently

transferred order type information (ati) into the order
book file (ABD) or reads the entered processing status

information (bsi) and transfers it to the data
processing installation (DVA), the order and

communication system information (afi, ksi) defining
the relevant administration order program module (APM).
Method according to Claim 1 or 2,
characterized

in that
 the order type information (ati) is represented
by a recording information item (efi) which records an

administration order program module (APM) and also the
order and communication system information (afi, ksi)

in the order book file (ABD).
Method according to one of Claims 1 or 2,
characterized

in that
 the order type information (ati) is represented
by a start information item (sti) which records the

currently transmitted administration order program
module (APM) in the order book file (ABD) and effects

the next possible start of processing for the
administration order program module (APM).
Method according to one of Claims 1 or 2,
characterized

in that
 the order type information (ati) is represented
by a deletion information item (li) which deletes the

processing order for the associated administration
order program module (APM).
Method according to one of Claims 1 or 2,
characterized
 

in that
 the order type information (ati) is represented
by a status information item (sai) which requests the

processing status information (bsi) for the associated
administration order program module (APM), where it is

possible to request

a recording status (EFS) indicating recording of
the administration order program module (APM),
a standby status indicating the standby state of
the respective administration order program module

(APM),
a transmission status indicating the transmission
of the respective administration order program

module (APM) to one of the communication systems
(KS),
an execution status indicating the end of
processing for the respective administration order

program module (APM),
an error status (FES) indicating an error during
the processing of the administration order program

module (APM),
a result status (ERS) indicating a processing
result for the respective administration order

program module (APM),
a deletion state indicating the deletion state of
the processing order for the respective

administration order program module (APM), and
a present status indicating the absence of the
respective administration order program module

(APM).
Method according to one of Claims 1 or 2,
characterized

in that
 the order type information (ati) is represented
by a time information item (ti) which stipulates the

start of processing for the associated administration
order program module (APM).
Method according to one of the preceding
claims,
characterized
 

in that
 the order information (afi) is represented by a
user task-related information item.
Method according to one of the preceding
claims,
characterized

in that
 the communication system information (ksi).
defines the communication system (KS) in the

communication network (KN) which has the entered
administration order program module (APM) associated

with it.
