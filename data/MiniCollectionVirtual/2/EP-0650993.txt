<CLAIMS>
Process for the production of semi-rigid foams
containing urethane groups by reaction of


1) polyisocyanates with
2) compounds containing at least two hydrogen atoms
active towards isocyanates and of a molecular

weight of 400 to 10000 in the presence of
3) water and/or organic blowing agents, optionally
in the presence of
4) compounds having at least two isocyanate-reactive
hydrogen atoms and a molecular weight of 32 to

399 as crosslinking agents and
5) per se known auxiliary substances and additives,

characterised in that the polyisocyanates 1) used are
polyisocyanate mixtures of


55 to 87 wt.%
of 4,4'-diphenylmethane diisocyanate
8 to 40 wt.%
of 2,4'-diphenylmethane diisocyanate
0.1 to 4 wt.%
of 2,2'-diphenylmethane diisocyanate
5 to 35 wt.%
of polyphenylpolymethylene polyisocyanates,

and wherein production does not proceed in accordance
with the prepolymer or semi-prepolymer process.
Process according to claim 1, characterised in that
the polyisocyanates 1) used are polyisocyanate

mixtures of 

60 to 75 wt.%
of 4,4'-diphenylmethane diisocyanate
10 to 25 wt.%
of 2,4'-diphenylmethane diisocyanate
1 to 3 wt.%
of 2,2'-diphenylmethane diisocyanate
10 to 30 wt.%
of polyphenylpolymethylene polyisocyanates.
Process according to claims 1 and 2,
characterised in that plastic films are foam backed

with the foam-forming reaction mixture to form
film/foam composites.
