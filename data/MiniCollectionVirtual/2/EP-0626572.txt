<ABSTRACT>
A pressure transducer (sensor) (20) includes a deformable diaphragm (22) which closes off a fluid passage (18) in a leaktight manner. In order to protect the diaphragm (22) against shocks, the passage (18), comprises a constriction (44) whose dimensions are defined so as to limit the pressure peak applied to the diaphragm to a cutoff value which can be withstood by this diaphragm. The constriction (44) may be formed in a removable capillary tube (42) or may be in the form of grooves made in a silicon wafer integrated with the active part of the sensor.

A pressure sensor comprising a deformable diaphragm (22) closing a fluid passage
(18) in sealed manner, and means for measuring deformation of the diaphragm,

characterized by the fact that the passage (18) includes a restriction (44, 44') so
designed as to co-operate with the diaphragm to form a lowpass filter with a

determined cutoff frequency (f0), said restriction implemented as a circular orifice of
radius rc (in mm) and of length 1 (in mm), satisfies the equation:



where:

n is the viscosity of the fluid at ambient temperature (in Pa.s);
rs is the useful radius of the diaphragm (in mm);
f0 is the cutoff frequency (in Hz) adopted for the sensor;
E is the Young's modulus (in Pa) of the diaphragm; and
e is the thickness of the diaphragm (in mm).
A pressure sensor according to claim 2, characterized by the fact that the cutoff
frequency f0 lies between a maximum frequency for normal operation of the sensor

and a maximum mechanically-acceptable frequency for the diaphragm (22).
A pressure sensor according to claim 3, characterized by the fact that the cutoff
frequency is equal to not more than 100 Hz.
A pressure sensor according to claim 4, characterized by the fact that the cutoff
frequency is around 10yHz at ambient temperature. 
A pressure sensor according to any preceding claim, characterized by the fact that
the deformable diaphragm (22) is mounted in a rigid tubular support (28) delimiting a

section of said passage internally, the said restriction (44, 44') being formed in this
section.
A pressure sensor according to claim 6, characterized by the fact that the
restriction (44) is formed by a detachable capillary tube (42) mounted in said section.
A pressure sensor according to claim 6, characterized by the fact that the rigid
tubular support (28) has a radial surface on which the deformable diaphragm (22) is

fixed via a decoupling part (36) with a central opening (38) communicating with said
section, a small plate (42') being fixed on a central portion of the decoupling part and

at least one groove defining said restriction being formed in one of the parts
constituted by the small plate (42') and the decoupling part (36), in such a manner as

to connect the central opening (38) to a peripheral edge of the small plate (42').
A pressure sensor according to claim 8, characterized by the fact that the
deformable diaphragm (22), the decoupling part (36) and the small plate (42') are of

silicon.
A pressure sensor according to claim 6, characterized by the fact that the rigid
tubular support (28) has a radial surface on which the deformable diaphragm (22) is

directly fixed, a small plate (42') being fixed on this radial surface in the continuation
of said section (34) of the passage, and at least one groove (44') defining said

restriction being formed in one of the parts constituted by the small plate (42') and the
rigid tubular support (28), in such a manner as to connect said section (34) to a

peripheral edge of the small plate (42').
A pressure sensor according to claim 10, characterized by the fact that the
deformable diaphragm (22) and the small plate (42') are of silicon. 
A pressure sensor according to any preceding claim, characterized by the fact
that the means for measuring a deformation of the diaphragm (22) comprise a bridge

of piezo-resistive strain gages carried by the diaphragm.
A gradiomanometer comprising a passage (18) filled with liquid and having ends
that open out at two spaced-apart locations, and a differential pressure sensor (20)

located in said passage, characterized by the fact that the differential pressure sensor is
in conformity with any preceding claim.
A gradiomanometer according to claim 13, characterized by the fact that a
bypass duct (24) with a normally-closed valve (26) is connected to said passage (18),

on both sides of the differential pressure sensor (20), the valve being adapted to open
in response to an abrupt displacement of the liquid in the passage.
