<ABSTRACT>
A display panel is formed using a single crystal thin-film material (15) that is transferred to substrates for display fabrication. Pixel arrays (22) form light valves or switches that can be fabricated with control electronics (18, 20) in the thin-film material prior to transfer. The resulting circuit panel (14) is then incorporated into a color display panel with a light emitting or liquid crystal material to provide the desired light valve.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to colour displays and methods of fabricating such displays. Flat-panel displays are being developed which
utilize liquid crystals or electroluminescent materials
to produce high quality images. These displays are
expected to supplant cathode ray tube (CRT) technology
and provide a more highly defined television picture.
The most promising route to large scale high quality
liquid crystal displays (LCDs), for example, is the
active-matrix approach in which thin-film transistors
(TFTs) are co-located with LCD pixels. The primary
advantage of the active matrix approach using TFTs is
the elimination of cross-talk between pixels, and the
excellent grey scale that can be attained with
TFT-compatible LCDs.Flat panel displays employing LCD's generally
include five different layers: a white light source, a
first polarizing filter that is mounted on one side of
a circuit panel on which the TFTs are arrayed to form
pixels, a filter plate containing at least three
primary colors arranged into pixels, and finally a
second polarizing filter. A volume between the circuit
panel and the filter plate is filled with a liquid
crystal material. This material will rotate the
polarization of light when an electric field is applied
across it between the circuit panel and a ground
affixed to the filter plate. Thus, when a particular
pixel of the display is turned on, the liquid crystal
material rotates polarized light being transmitted
through the material so that it will pass through the
second polarizing filter.The primary approach to TFT formation over the
large areas required for flat panel displays has
involved the use of amorphous silicon which has 
previously been developed for large-area photovoltaic
devices. Although the TFT approach has proven to be
feasible, the use of amorphous silicon compromises
certain aspects of the panel performance. For example,
amorphous silicon TFTs lack the frequency response
needed for large area displays due to the low electron
mobility inherent in amorphous material. Thus, the use
of amorphous silicon limits display speed, and is also
unsuitable for the fast logic needed to drive the
display.Owing to the limitations of amorphous silicon,
other alternative materials include polycrystalline
silicon, or laser recrystallized silicon. These
materials are limited as they use silicon that is
already on glass which generally restricts further
circuit processing to low temperatures. An active
matrix comprising TFTs is also useful in
electroluminescent (EL) displays.
