Marrow nail with a distal end (2), a proximal end (3), a
longitudinal axis (4) and a slot (5) in the area of the proximal

end (3) running transverse to the longitudinal axis (4) as well
as a cylindrical casing (10) which can be slid onto the proximal

end (3) and exhibits a cylindrical axis (11) as well as at least
two openings (12;13) placed at opposite ends of the cylindrical

cover (14), whereby

A) the casing (10) is formed in such a way that upon being slid
onto the marrow nail (1) it can be brought into an axial

fastening position relative to the nail (1); and
B) the openings (12;13) are thereby positioned in the fastening
position of the casing (10) in the area of the slot (5) and form

with the latter a channel (12;5;13) running transversely through
the marrow nail (1) and the casing (10) to admit bone fixation

devices (20),

characterized in that
C) the openings (12;13) are in the form of slots for receiving a
bone blade.
Marrow nail according to claim 1, characterized in that the
casing (10) is transportable in the axial fastening position in

the area of its preferably closed proximal end (15) at the
proximal end (3) of the nail (1).
Marrow nail according to claim 1 or 2, characterized in that
the openings (12;1
3) are so positioned that when a bone fixation
device (20) is inserted into the transverse channel (12;5;13)

the axial displacement of the casing (10) with respect to the
marrow nail (1) is at most 20 %, preferably at most 10 % of the

total length of the slot (5).
Marrow nail according to claim 3, characterized in that the
axial displacement of the casing (10) with respect to the marrow

nail (1) is at most 5 %, preferably at most 2 % of the total
length of the slot (5).
Marrow nail according to one of the claims 1 - 4,
characterized in that the openings (12;13) don't lie at the same

height.
Marrow nail according to claim 5, characterized in that the
openings (12;13) are placed such that a bone fixation device

inserted therein may form an angle of 30째 - 150째, preferably of
45째 - 135째 with the longitudinal axis (4). 
Marrow nail according to one of the claims 1 - 6,
characterized in that the cylindrical casing (10) at its

proximal end (15) which is closed has a central bore hole (16).
Marrow nail according to one of the claims 1 - 7,
characterized in that the marrow nail (1) at its proximal end

(3) has a central bore hole (17), preferably with an internal
thread (19).
Marrow nail according to one of the claims 1 - 8,
characterized in that the marrow nails (1) at its proximal end

(3) has a groove (21) transverse to its longitudinal axis (4).
Marrow nail according to claim 9, characterized in that the
casing (10) at its proximal end (15) has a groove (22) that

corresponds with the groove (21) of the marrow nail (1).
Marrow nail according to one of the claims 1 - 10,
characterized in that the marrow nail (1) and the casing (10)

are configured to be able to be turned against each other.
Marrow nail according to one of the claims 1 - 11,
characterized in that the slotted openings (12;13) have the form

of an elongated hole.
