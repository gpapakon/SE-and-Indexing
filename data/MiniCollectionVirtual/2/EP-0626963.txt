<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to new vinylene-azaindole derivatives, to a process
for their preparation, to pharmaceutical compositions containing them and to
their use as therapeutic agents.Aryl- and heteroarylethenylene derivatives, useful as tyrosine kinase inhibitors,
are known in the art as described in WO 91/13055, in the name of the applicant.
The instant compounds, however, have a better biologic activity.The present invention provides compounds having the following general formula
(I)

wherein
one of the groups X1 to X4 is N and the others are CH;R is a group of formula (a), (b), (c), (d) or (e)

in which
nis zero or an integer of 1 to 5;R1is hydrogen, halogen, C1-C6 alkyl, C1-C6 alkoxy, nitro
or a group -NR4R5 wherein each of R4 and R5 is
independently hydrogen or C1-C6 alkyl;R2is hydrogen, C1-C6 alkyl or C1-C6 alkanoyl;R3is hydrogen, halogen, hydroxy, C1-C6 alkoxy, carboxy,
nitro or a group -NR4R5, wherein R4 and R5 are as
defined above, and the pharmaceutically acceptable
salts thereof.In the compounds of the invention each of the
substituents R and R1 may be independently on either of
the pyridine or pyrrole moieties of the bicyclic
azaindole ring.The invention includes within its scope all the possible
isomers, stereoisomers, in particular Z- and E-isomers
and their mixtures, and the metabolites and the
metabolic precursors or bio-precursors (otherwise known
as pro-drugs) of the compounds of formula (I).The substituent R is preferably linked to position 2 or
3 of the azaindole ring, in particular to position 3. The substituent R1 is preferably on the pyridine moiety,
in particular on the carbon adjacent to the nitrogen
ring atom. When one of R1 and R3 is nitro or a -NR4R5
group as defined above, then the other has preferably a
different meaning. The R3 substituent is preferably in 5-position
of the oxindole ring (e).The alkyl groups and the alkyl moiety in the alkoxy and
alkanoyl groups may be branched or straight alkyl chain.
A C1-C6 alkyl group is preferably a C1-C4 alkyl group,
e.g. methyl, ethyl propyl, isopropyl, butyl, sec-butyl
or tert-butyl, in particular methyl or ethyl.A C1-C6 alkoxy group is preferably a C1-C3 alkoxy group,
in particular methoxy, ethoxy or n-propoxy.A C2-C6 alkanoyl group is preferably a C2-C3 alkanoyl
group, in particular acetyl or propionyl.A halogen is preferably fluorine, chlorine or bromine,
in particular chlorine.Pharmaceutically acceptable salts of the compounds of
the invention include acid addition salts with
inorganic, e.g. nitric, hydrochloric,
