<ABSTRACT>
Methods of producing analgesia and enhancing opiate analgesia are disclosed. The methods include administering a TVIA (SNX-185) or MVIIA (SNX-111) omega-conopeptide, or derivative thereof which is characterized by its ability to (a) inhibit voltage-gated calcium channels selectively in neuronal tissue, as evidenced by the peptide's ability to inhibit electrically stimulated contraction of the guinea pig ileum, and (b) bind to omega conopeptide MVIIA binding sites present in neuronal tissue. Also disclosed is a novel omega conotoxin peptide derivative effective in producing analgesia.

conditions such as bone degenerative diseases and
cancer, is a debilitating condition which is treated
with a variety of analgesic agents, and often opioid
compounds, such as morphine.In general, brain pathways governing the
perception of pain are still incompletely understood,
sensory afferent synaptic connections to the spinal
cord, termed "nociceptive pathways" have been
documented in some detail. In the first leg of such
pathways, C- and A-fibers which project from

<CLAIMS>
IT IS CLAIMED:
1. A method of producing analgesia in a mammalian subject, comprising administering to the subject, an omega conopeptide selected from the group consisting of TVIA (SNX-185) , MVIIA (SNX-111) and derivatives thereof which are effective (a) to inhibit voltage- gated calcium channels selectively in neuronal tissue, as evidenced by the peptide's ability to inhibit electrically stimulated contraction of the guinea pig ileum, and (b) to bind to omega conopeptide MVIIA binding sites present in neuronal tissue.
2. The method of claim 1, wherein the activities of the omega conopeptide in calcium- channel inhibition and in binding to the MVIIA binding site are within the ranges of such activities of omega-conotoxins MVIIA and TVIA.
3. The method of claim 1, wherein the omega conopeptide is MVIIA or TVIA.
4. The method of claim 1, wherein the omega conopeptide is SEQ ID NO: 30 (SNX-236) .
5. The method of claim 1, wherein the analgesia is produced in a subject exhibiting neuropathic pain.
6. The method of claim 1, wherein the omega conopeptide is administered intrathecally.
7. A method of enhancing the analgesic effect produced by administration of opiates to a mammalian 


subject, comprising co-administering to the subject, an omega conopeptide selected from the group consisting of TVIA (SNX-185) , MVIIA (SNX-111) and derivatives thereof which are effective (a) to inhibit voltage- gated calcium channels selectively in neuronal tissue, as evidenced by the peptide's ability to inhibit electrically stimulated contraction of the guinea pig ileum, and (b) to bind to omega conopeptide MVIIA binding sites present in neuronal tissue, at a dose effective to enhance the analgesic effect of the opiate.
8. The method of claim 5, wherein the activities of the omega conopeptide in calcium- channel inhibition and in binding to the MVIIA binding site are within the ranges of such activities of omega-conotoxins MVIIA and TVIA.
9. The method of claim 5, wherein the omega conopeptide is MVIIA or TVIA.
10. The method of claim 5, wherein the omega conopeptide is administered intrathecally.
11. An omega conopeptide having the sequence: SEQ ID NO: 30 (SNX-236) .
