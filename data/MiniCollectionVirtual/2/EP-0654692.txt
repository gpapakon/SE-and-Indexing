<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to progressive power ophthalmic lenses in accordance with the precharacterizing
clause of claim 1.A lens of this kind is disclosed in US-2 878 721. In said known lens astigmatism is kept to a minimum
by distributing it over the entire area of the lens. Thereby, both the distant and near centers of vision
become objectionable astigmatic. Thus, while the lens displays a sufficient continuity, it would not be
acceptable to the wearer.The GB-A-2 092 772 and US-A-4 514 061 disclose progressive power lenses wherein the surface power
of the lens has a local maximum in the near vision area. The power surfaces of said known lenses comprise
the curve of intersection of a sphere of variable diameter and a cylinder of circular cross section.It is an object of the present invention to provide a progressive power ophthalmic lens with a
progressive surface designed to ensure the smoothest possible distribution and lowest possible levels of
astigmatism with orthoscopy at least approximately preserved in lateral margins of the lens and without
accrual of strong aberration elsewhere in the lens.It is a further object of the invention to provide a progressive power lens having a natural non abrupt
flow of optical lens power that will be readily accepted by emerging and advanced presbyobs alike.In detail, the following may be considered as being the principle goals in the design of a progressive
lens which are to be reaches at least, by way of compromise:
1. Optically stable and aberration-free distance and near-viewing areas.2. Progressive corridor of useful width and convenient length.3. Minimized surface astigmatism.4. Minimized lateral power error.5. Minimized skew distortion.6. Minimized binocular power and astigmatic imbalance.7. Minimized binocular vertical prismatic imbalance.8. Visual continuity, i.e., smooth and continuous optical effect.The above and other objects are achieved in accordance with progressive power lenses as described in
the independent claim. Further advantageous features of this lens are evident from the dependent claims.In the present invention by maximizing the area allocated for distributing the
surface astigmatism aberration the DP (distance portion) and the RP (reading portion) areas each are
"shrunk" to a mathematical point.The invention, therefore, provides a progressive power spectacle lens with the smoothest possible
distribution of dioptric power and lowest possible level of unwanted astigmatism, with orthoscopy at least
approximately preserved in the lateral
