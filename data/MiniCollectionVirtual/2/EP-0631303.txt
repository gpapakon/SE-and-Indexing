<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a method for
fabricating multilayer circuits using dielectric green
tapes to achieve electrical isolation between the
layers.An interconnect circuit board is the physical
realization of electronic circuits or subsystems from a
number of extremely small circuit elements electrically
and mechanically interconnected on a substrate. It is
frequently desirable to combine these diverse type
electronic components in an arrangement so that they
can be physically isolated and mounted adjacent one
another in a single compact package and electrically
connected to each other and/or to common connections
extending from the package.Complex electronic circuits generally require
that the circuit be constructed of several layers of
conductors separated by insulating dielectric layers.
The conductive layers are interconnected between levels
by electrically conductive pathways through the
dielectric called vias. Such a multilayer structure
allows a circuit to be more compact.One well known method for constructing a
multilayer circuit is by sequentially printing and
firing thick film conductors and insulating dielectrics
on a rigid insulative substrate such as alumnia. The
alumina substrate provides mechanical support and also
X-Y dimensional stability and facilitates registration
to the patterned thick film conductors and dielectric 
layers. However, the thick film process has a
disadvantage in that printing through a screen mesh can
result in pinholes or voids in the dielectric layer
which can cause shorting between conductor layers. If
a thick film dielectric is formulated to allow
sufficient flow of the paste during the printing
operation and thus to minimize the tendency to form
pinholes, then the maintenance of small vias is likely
to be compromised by the flow of dielectric paste into
the via hole. Also, the repetitive printing and firing
steps for each layer are time consuming and expensive.Another prior art method for constructing
multilayer circuits is that of co-firing a multiplicity
of ceramic tape dielectrics on which conductors have
been printed with metallized vias extending through the
dielectric layers to interconnect the various conductor
layers. (See Steinberg, U.S. Patent 4,654,095.) These
tape layers are stacked in registry and pressed
together at a preselected temperature and pressure to
form a monolithic structure which is fired at an
elevated temperature to drive off the organic binder,
sinter the conductive metal and densify the dielectric.
This process has the advantage

A method for the fabrication of multilayer

(a) providing a dimensionally stable electrically
insulative substrate (1),
(b) applying to the substrate (1) a patterned

dielectric green tape (3),
(e) forming vias (4) in selected positions through
the layer of dielectric green tape (3) in registration with the

fired patterned conductive layer (2) of step (c),
(f) filling the vias (4) in the dielectric green tape
layer (3) with a conductive metallization,
(g) co-firing the filled vias (4) in the dielectric

tape layer (3),
(h) applying a patterned conductive layer (5) to the
fired dielectric green tape layer (3) in registry with the vias

co-fired in step (i).
