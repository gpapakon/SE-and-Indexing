<ABSTRACT>
A semiconductor laser element (133) is mounted to a 
heat sink (132) which is formed as one body with a stem 

(131) and is covered with a cap (138) mounted to the stem 
(131). An opening (138a) through which a fluid material 

(105) is filled into the cap (138) is provided on the top 
face of the cap (138). The opening (138a) is closed with a 

hologram glass (139).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method of
manufacturing semiconductor devices
such as semiconductor laser devices and light emitting diode
devices.A semiconductor elements such as a semiconductor laser
element (chip) is very small, easy to break, and highly
affected by the ambient atmosphere, in particular by
moisture. For the reasons, the semiconductor element is
conventionally encapsulated in a package to use.Fig. 10 shows an example of a hermetically sealed
semiconductor laser device which is presently mass-produced.The semiconductor laser device comprises a metal stem 1
integrated with a heat sink, on which a semiconductor laser
element (chip) 2 and a light receiving element 3 for
detecting an optical output from the semiconductor laser
element 2, for example, a photodiode chip for monitoring, 
are mounted, which are electrically connected in their
terminal by wire bonding, and is encapsulated in a manner
such that a can package 5 mounting a flat glass 4 with a low
melting point is seam-welded to the metal stem 1 in nitrogen
ambience, and various functions such as moisture proofing and
heat dissipation are maintained by filling nitrogen gas in
the can package 5.The semiconductor laser device hermetically sealed in
the above-mentioned constitution is airtight, and the
semiconductor laser element 2 is isolated from the outside
air. Such semiconductor laser device, however, comprises a
lot of parts and as well the steps for manufacturing such
device are complicated, with the result that the device is
disadvantageous from a view point of mass production and it is
difficult to satisfy the requirements for cost reduction.
Additionally, since the heat conductivity of nitrogen gas is
low, there is no other way of dissipating the heat to the
outside than through the metal stem 1, in order to release the
heat radiated from the semiconductor laser device 2, and as
a result a larger metal stem 1 is required, which leads to
limitation of size reduction. Additionally, since a part of
a laser beam passing through the flat glass 4 is reflected
on the boundary with the nitrogen, disadvantageously the
light availability is not so good. It is also a
disadvantage that nitrogen is expensive. In Japanese Unexamined Patent Publications JPA 60-63977
(1985) (hereinafter described as "prior art 1") and JPA 63-14489
(1988) (hereinafter described as "prior art 2") are
disclosed semiconductor laser devices to solve the above
problems. Figs. 11A, 11B are views showing the constitution
of prior art 1, which are a
