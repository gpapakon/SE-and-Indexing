<DESCRIPTION>
 ION-SENSITIVE BIPYRIDINE COMPLEXES Field of the InventionThe invention relates to ion-sensitive compounds. More particularly, the invention relates to ion-sensitive compounds comprising a receptor designed to bind anionic species by the formation of a receptor-substrate complex. Background of the InventionAnion receptors comprising a plurality of quaternary amine groups are known. Examples of such compounds may be seen in P.G. Potvin and J-M Lehn, Prog. Macrocyclic Chem . , 1987, 3, 214.L.A. Summers, "The Bipyridinium Herbicides", Academic Press, New York, 1980, describes the use of certain compounds comprising diquaternary 2,2'- bipyridinium moieties in herbicidal applications.Metal ion centres have also been utilised in systems for the recognition of anions as described in D.N. Reinhoudt, J.Am. Chem. Soc. 1992, 114, 9671-9673. Problem to be solved by the InventionThere is a continuing need to provide new receptor compounds for a variety of applications. For example, there is a need for compounds which can be incorporated in electrochemical or optical sensors for anion determination. There is also a need for compounds which can be used in removal devices where levels of a given anion need to be kept low.It is also desirable to provide receptor compounds which can be readily synthesised. Summary of the InventionThe ion-sensitive compounds of the invention have the formula A-^+B-^- wherein A represents a cation capable of forming a receptor-substrate complex with an anion, and B represents one or more counter anions, 

characterised in that the cation is an anion receptor represented by the formula Ior by the formula II
 whereinR**** and R-2 are each independently a substituted or unsubstituted alkyl group, a substituted or unsubstituted aryl group or R1 and R2 taken together with the atoms separating them represent the atoms necessary to complete a (2)- cryptand; and, R-*** and R4 are each independently H or a lower alkyl group having from 1 to 4 carbon atoms, or R3 and R4 taken together represent an ethylene bridging group.The invention also provides a method of sensing an anion in solution by contacting the anionSUBSTITUTE SHEET(RULE2b) 

with a compound comprising a cation which is a receptor for the anion to form a receptor-substrate complex and sensing a detectable change which results from the formation of the complex characterised in that the compound is a compound of the invention.
