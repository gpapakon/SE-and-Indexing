<DESCRIPTION>
This invention is concerned with the determination
of the three-dimensional structure of biological
macromolecules, especially proteins. In particular, it
is concerned with novel compositions and methods for
the determination, by NMR spectroscopy, of the three-dimensional
structure of proteins expressed in cultures
of mammalian or insect cells.For many years, there has been intense interest in
the determination of the three-dimensional structure of
biological macromolecules, particularly proteins. So-called
"structure-function" studies have been carried
out with a view to determining which structural
features of a molecule, or class of molecules, are
important for biological activity. Since the
pioneering work of Nobel laureates, Perutz and
coworkers on the structure of hemoglobin (Perutz, M.F.
et al., Nature, 185, 416-422 (1960)) and Watson and
Crick on the structure of DNA (Watson, J.D. and Crick,
F.H.C., Nature, 171, 737 (1953)), this field has been
of major importance in the biological sciences. More recently, there has evolved the concept of
"rational drug design." This strategy for the design
of drugs involves the determination of the three-dimensional
structure of an "active part" of a
particular biological molecule, such as a protein. The
biological molecule may, for example, be a receptor, an
enzyme, a hormone, or other biologically active
molecule. Knowing the three-dimensional structure of
the active site can enable scientists to design
molecules that will block, mimic or enhance the natural
biological activity of the molecule. (Appelt, K., et
al., J. Med. Chem., 34, 1925 (1991)). The
determination of the three-dimensional structure of
biological molecules is therefore also of great
practical and commercial significance.The first technique developed to determine three-dimensional
structures was X-ray crystallography. The
structures of hemoglobin and DNA were both determined
using this technique. X-ray crystallography involves
bombarding a crystal of the material to be examined
with a beam of X-rays which are refracted by the atoms
of the ordered molecules in the crystal. The scattered
X-rays are captured on a photographic plate, which is
then developed using standard techniques. The
diffracted X-rays are thus visualized as a series of
spots on the plate, and from this pattern, the
structure of the molecules in the crystal can be
determined. For larger molecules, it is also necessary
to crystallize the material with a heavy ion, such as
ruthenium, in order to remove ambiguity due to phase
diffe
