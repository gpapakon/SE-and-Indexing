<ABSTRACT>
Apparatus for testing an integrated circuit device (DUT) having an input port and an output port comprises multiple state devices (10-16) each having multiple states that occur in a predetermined sequence and an output port at which it provides an event signal. A first of the state device is an emitting device (10) that emits an event marker signal at a predetermined time in advance of entering a predefined state, a second of the state devices is a receiving device (11) that responds to receipt of an event marker signal, at least one of the state devices (11) has its output port connected to the input port of the DUT, and at least one of the state devices is a measurement device (13) connected to the output port of the DUT. An interconnection matrix (30) is connected to each state device and allows each state device to communicate an event marker signal to each other.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to apparatus for
automatic testing of complex devices, and is
particularly applicable to apparatus for automatic
testing of complex electronic circuit devices.
Such devices may be fabricated in a variety of
technologies and over a wide range of integration
scales.In manufacture of electronic circuit devices,
it is important to be able to verify that a
particular unit meets the functional specifications
prescribed for that model of circuit. Such an
electronic circuit device is typically tested
either manually, with discrete test and measurement
instruments, or by using an automated test equipment
(ATE) system if one with sufficient capability is
available. Use of an automated test system is
preferred over the manual method of testing for
reasons of speed, accuracy and repeatability, but
an automated test system often cannot provide
adequate capabilities to perform all required tests
for full and accurate device parameter verification.An ATE system comprises a test socket that is
mated with connection pins of the device under test
(DUT), a stimulus device for applying a preset
sequence of stimuli to the DUT and an acquisition
device for receiving signals representative of the
response of the DUT to the stimuli. Computer
control of stimulus and acquisition instrumentation
resources integrate the whole into a system that is
instructed through software to perform complex
testing processes. In a conventional ATE system, the stimulus
device and the acquisition device operate under
timing control of a single master event controlling
device which specifies the phase relationships
between all activities in a given test procedure.
In order to provide maximum accuracy while also
providing minimum test time, Digital Signal
Processing (DSP) techniques are employed for
testing of analog parameters and relationships
between analog (continuously variable) and digital
(discretely variable) activities. The primary
requirement for rapidly-executing DSP test
techniques is coherent timing between stimulus and
acquisition activities. Coherent timing requires
precise integer ratios between frequencies of
execution and renders absolute accuracy of the
frequencies of much less importance. For this
reason, a conventional coherent automated test
system contains a single master timing reference
from which all stimulus and acquisition device
state timing is derived.This timing approach allows many
characteristics of the DUT to be measured, but
is subject to some limitations. For example, the
conventional
