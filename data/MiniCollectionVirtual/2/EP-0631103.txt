<ABSTRACT>
In order to impregnate with water the sponge balls (1) intended for cleaning the tubes of a condenser, they are introduced into a tank (2) whose top part forms a chamber (10) separated from the remainder by a grid (9) through which the balls cannot pass, which chamber is connected to a jack (17) having a piston (19) and then, after the tank and the volumes communicating with it have been filled with water, all the valves giving access to this tank are closed, the piston is withdrawn from the jack, which expels the air from the balls in the chamber, and the whole is refilled with water so as to remove this air and to impregnate the balls with water.

Apparatus for impregnating spongy balls for cleaning
the tubes of a condenser or the like, the apparatus

comprising a tank (2) interposed between first and second
(4, 6) valves associated respectively with a water inlet

duct (3) and with a water outlet duct (5), a cqupling
provided with a third valve (7) connecting the top of the

tank to a source (8) of new cleaning balls (1), a grid
(9) having a mesh that is too small to allow the balls to

pass disposed inside the tank in such a manner as to
define a chamber (10) at the top of the tank which is

inaccessible to the balls, a duct fitted with a fourth
valve (15) connecting said chamber to an outlet, and a

device suitable for generating a pressure reduction in
said chamber, the apparatus being characterized in that

the device for generating a pressure reduction is
constituted by a pump (17,28) having a piston in

which one of two compartments separated by the piston

   (19, 29) communicates with the chamber (10) in
such a manner that each go-and-return stroke of the

piston successively increases by a well-determined
quantity the volume defined by the inside of the tank and

by the spaces in communication with said inside when the

four above-mentioned valves serving the tank are all
closed, and then cancels said increase.
Apparatus according to claim 1, characterized in that
the pump is constituted by a diaphragm pump whose moving

member (29) constitutes the bottom of the tank (2).
Apparatus according to claim 1 or 2, characterized in
that the upper chamber (10) inside the tank (2) has,

passing through it, a vertical chimney that is laterally
defined by a grid (11), the chimney extending downwards

the coupling between the tank and the third valve (7),
and in that a float (12) is disposed beneath said chimney 

in such a manner to prevent the balls contained in the
tank from moving back up inside said chimney.
A cleaning installation for cleaning tubes in a
condenser or the like by means of balls, the installation

being characterized in that it comprises the apparatus
according to anyone of claims 1 to 3, including the tank

(2), the pump (17, 28), and the associated pipework and
valves serving them connected in parallel with the

pipework (37) for recycling the balls, which pipework
extends from the outlet of the condenser to the inlet

thereof.
A cleaning installation according to claim 4,
characterized in that the apparatus comprising the tank

(2), the pump (17, 28) and the associated pipework and
valves serving them is associated with a ball counter

(45) and with a ball sorter (46) in such a manner that
any removal of a charge of worn balls from the

installation is compensated by insertion into said
installation of an equivalent charge of new balls

impregnated with water, and in that the operation of the
assembly is automated.
An impregnation method implementing the apparatus
according to anyone of claims 1 to 3, characterized by

the following sequence of steps: with the first two
valves (4, 6) closed and the other two valves (7, 15)

open, a charge of new balls (1) is inserted into the tank
(2) through the third valve (7); then, with the second

and third valves (6, 7) closed and with the other two
valves (4, 15) open, water is admitted into the tank

until it has been completely filled with water; then,
with all four valves closed, the piston or the like (19,

29) is actuated in the direction corresponding to
increasing the volume that is in communication with the

inside of the tank, thereby subjecting said volume to a 
reduction in pressure and expelling from the balls at

least part of the air contained therein, which air is
collected in the upper chamber of the tank and in the

capacity in communication with said chamber; after which
the first and fourth valves (4, 15) are opened so as to

fill all of the volumes in question with water, thereby
impregnating with water the balls that have been at least

partially emptied of air, and the piston or the like is
actuated in the direction opposite to the preceding

direction to return it to its initial position, the cycle
of the two above-defined steps implementing a go-and-return

stroke of the piston optionally being
repeated one or more times.
An impregnation method according to claim 6,
characterized in that if the volume of the cylinder

capacity of the pump is written V and if the volume at
atmospheric pressure of the air contained in the cells of

the charge of balls inserted into the tank is written 
v
,
then V is given a value that is greater than 4v.
