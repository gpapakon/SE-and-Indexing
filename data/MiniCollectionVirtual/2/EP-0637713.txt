<ABSTRACT>
A diagnostic system for control and shut-off valves uses the processor of an intelligent position controller (14) as a digital signal processor (46), which is connected to sensors (32-38) that monitor the operation of the valve and measure operating variables of the valve and which, if the measured values deviate from comparison values measured previously when the valve was operating satisfactorily, emits an alarm signal.
