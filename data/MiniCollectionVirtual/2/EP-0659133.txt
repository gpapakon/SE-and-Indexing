<ABSTRACT>
The master cylinder (30) includes primary and secondary pistons (42, 52) each of which has a center compensation valve member (44, 60). An abutment member or pin (38, 40) extends across a bore (36) of the master cylinder (30) adjacent ends of each of the pistons (42, 52) and the pins (38, 40) are each engaged by shafts (45, 64) of the spring biased valve members (44, 60) of the primary and secondary pistons (42, 52). An output rod (43) of a vacuum booster (41) to which the master cylinder (30) is attached disposes the primary piston (52) slightly spaced apart from the respective pin (40) in an at-rest position. The primary piston (52) includes a self-adjusting compensation center valve seat (70) located within the primary piston (52), the valve seat (70) sealingly and slidingly movable relative to the primary piston (52). The valve seat (70) extends through a rear opening (59) of the piston (52) to engage the respective pin (40). The engagement of the valve seat (70) and shaft (64) of the valve member (60) ensures that the valve head (62) is always positioned a predetermined distance (C) from the valve seat (70) in the at-rest position of the primary piston (52). The brake pedal "feel" can be closely controlled to minimize soft pedal feel during brake actuation by minimizing stackup tolerances within the master cylinder (30) such that the valve member (60) of the primary piston (52) closes very quickly.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates generally to a 
tandem master cylinder having center compensation valves, 
and in particular to a master cylinder having a self-adjusting 
compensation center valve for the primary 
piston. Master cylinders such as in DE-A-3835396 have 
been provided previously with center compensation valves. 
Figure 1 herein illustrates a tandem master cylinder 
having center compensation valves for the primary and 
secondary pistons 10 and 20. Master cylinder 1 is 
attached to a vacuum brake booster 2 having an output rod 
3 which positions the primary piston 10 a short distance 
from the abutment member or pin 4. Secondary piston 20 
abuts the pin 5. In the illustrated at-rest position, 
valve member 6 located within primary piston 10 is in an 
open position, as is also valve member 7 of the secondary 
piston 20. Because this type of master cylinder does not 
utilize a caged primary spring instead of the illustrated 
primary spring 8, the total compensation loss for the 
master cylinder is the sum of the primary and secondary 
compensation travel distances. The tolerance of the 
secondary compensation travel is smaller than the 
tolerance of the primary compensation travel. This is 
because the secondary piston and the valve member 7 rest 
against the pin 5 in the released position, while the 
primary piston 10 does not rest against the pin 4. Thus, 
there are only two dimensions that control the tolerance 
of the secondary compensation travel. However, there are 
as many as six dimensions that control the tolerance of 
the compensation travel of valve member 6. It is highly 
desirable to provide a master cylinder which maintains 
tight control on the travel tolerance of the secondary 
piston 20 and associated valve member 7 and which reduces  
 
the tolerance of the primary piston compensation travel 
to the same value as that of the secondary compensation 
travel. Thus, the overall tolerance of the sum of the 
compensation travels of the master cylinder would be 
significantly reduced. DE-A-3435088 discloses a center-compensation 
valve master cylinder having an adjustable 
valve seat located sealingly and slidably within a 
piston. The present invention provides solutions to the 
above problems by providing a master cylinder having at 
least one piston with a center compensation valve and a 
valve member of the valve abutting stationary abutment 
means located within a bore of the master cylinder, the 
valve having an adjustable valve seat located sealingly 
and slidingly within said

A master cylinder (30) having at least one 
piston (52) with a center compensation valve and a valve 

member (60) of the valve abutting stationary abutment 
means (40) located within a bore (36) of the master 

cylinder (30), the valve having an adjustable valve seat 
(70) located sealingly and slidingly within said piston 

(52), and the valve member (60) having a shaft (64) 
extending slidably through said adjustable valve seat 

(70) and engaging the abutment means (40) in the at-rest 
position, characterized in that the valve seat (70) 

extends through a rear opening (59) of said piston (52) 
and engages said abutment means (40) in an at-rest 

position of said piston (52), and the valve member (60) 
biased by resilient means (55) connected with said piston 

(52), so that in the at-rest position said valve member 
(60) is positioned such that fluid may flow through said 

piston (52), and during actuation of said piston (52) the 
valve member (60) sealingly engages the adjustable valve 

seat (70) to prevent fluid flow through said piston (52). 
The master cylinder in accordance with Claim 
1, characterized in that the piston (52) comprises a 

stepped through opening (54) having a shoulder (57) 
located adjacent the rear opening (59), said adjustable 

valve seat (70) includes a stepped exterior having a 
complementary shaped shoulder (76) located adjacent the 

shoulder (57) of the piston (52), the valve member (60)

relative to the piston (52) during actuation of the 
master cylinder (30) so that said shoulders (57, 76)

The master cylinder in accordance with Claim 
2, characterized in that the adjustable valve seat (70) 

includes a groove (72) thereabout receiving therein a 
seal (74) which sealingly engages a surface of the
