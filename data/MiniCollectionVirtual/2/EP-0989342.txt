<ABSTRACT>
A hybrid seal segment and a rotary machine (such as a
steam or gas turbine) containing such hybrid seal segment. The

machine has a rotor, a stator casing, and the hybrid seal segment (10).
The annular hybrid seal segment has a circumferentially-extending

channel (46) between axially-spaced-apart first and second
labyrinth-seal segments (26,28) which are attached to a

radially-outwardly located mounting block (30) which is
circumferentially offset from the labyrinth-seal segments. A brush-seal

segment (32) is positioned in the channel.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates generally to seals, and more
particularly to a hybrid labyrinth-brush seal for a rotary machine.Rotary machines include, without limitation, turbines for
steam turbines and compressors and turbines for gas turbines. A
steam turbine has a steam path which typically includes, in serial-flow
relationship, a steam inlet, a turbine, and a steam outlet. A gas turbine
has a gas path which typically includes, in serial-flow relationship, an air
intake (or inlet), a compressor, a combustor, a turbine, and a gas outlet
(or exhaust nozzle). Gas or steam leakage, either out of the gas or
steam path or into the gas or steam path, from an area of higher
pressure to an area of lower pressure, is generally undesirable. For
example, gas-path leakage in the turbine or compressor area of a gas
turbine, between the rotor of the turbine or compressor and the
circumferentially surrounding turbine or compressor casing, will lower
the efficiency of the gas turbine leading to increased fuel costs. Also,
steam-path leakage in the turbine area of a steam turbine, between the
rotor of the turbine and the circumferentially surrounding casing, will
lower the efficiency of the steam turbine leading to increased fuel costs.Hybrid labyrinth-brush seals have been proposed for use
between a rotor and a surrounding casing in gas and steam turbines.
The annular hybrid seal includes circumferentially-arrayed hybrid seal
segments positioned in a circumferential groove in the casing . Each
hybrid seal segment has the shape of generally an annular segment of
a circular ring. One or more of the rows of radially-inwardly-projecting
and circumferentially-extending stainless-steel labyrinth-seal teeth are 
replaced with brush-seal bristles. The teeth of a labyrinth seal segment
of a labyrinth seal have radially-cut circumferential ends, and the
bristles of a brush seal segment of a brush seal are canted at typically
a forty-five degree angle with respect to a radius line. For a hybrid
labyrinth-brush seal segment, making the circumferential ends of the
tooth portion of a seal segment have a forty-five degree cant angle to
match the bristles will create teeth with very sharp circumferential ends
which creates a safety hazard to persons installing or replacing the seal
segments. For a hybrid labyrinth-brush seal segment, trimming the
circumferential ends of the angled bristle portion of a seal segment to
prevent the bristles from circumferentially extending beyond the
radially-cut circumferential ends of the tooth
