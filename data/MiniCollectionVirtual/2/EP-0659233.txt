<ABSTRACT>
A process is described to supply a liquid lubricant to the points to be lubricated of a reciprocating piston engine. The lubricant is led by a gaseous transport medium through supply ducts at least in the area of the point to be lubricated and is applied on the surfaces to be lubricated as small liquid particles. The lubricant and the transport medium are mixed in a conditioning device. The amount of lubricant is dosed by modifying the volume flow of transport medium and/or the concentration of lubricant in the transport medium. In order to lubricate the running surfaces of a piston/cylinder tube unit, the lubricant mixture is led through at least one supply bore arranged in the wall of the cylinder into the gap between the outer surface of the piston and the inner surface of the cylinder wall. The supply bore is arranged in such a way that it opens into the gap when the piston is at the bottom dead centre below the uppermost piston ring.
