<ABSTRACT>
A guide portion (G) is provided in a front edge of a 
disc cartridge in an insertion direction to a recording and 

reproducing apparatus. A slider (14) is slidingly engaged 
with the guide portion. A shutter (6)is fixed to the 

slider. Head insertion holes (5) and spindle holes (4) 
formed in the cartridge case are opened or closed by the 

shutter (6). A generation of friction or wear chips due to 
the sliding contact between the shutter (6) and cartridge 

(1) may be prevented.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a disc cartridge
according to the preamble of claim 1.In general, a magnetic disc or an optical disc is
encased in a cassette case made of two shell halves. A hole
into which a spindle for rotating the disc is to be inserted
is formed in a central portion of the cassette case. Head
insertion holes into which a write and read head is to be
inserted is formed in the cassette case so as to extend in
the radial direction to traverse the recording surface of
the disc.Such a disc cartridge is shown in, for example,
Japanese Utility Model Unexamined Publication No. 62-168176.
This cartridge has a shell for encasing the disc. A spindle
hole is formed in the central portion of the shell half. A
hub formed in the central portion of the disc is located in
the spindle hole of each shell half. The spindle of the
recording and reproducing apparatus is to be located at the
hub which is sucked by a turntable.The head insertion holes are formed on an insertion
side of the cartridge relative to the recording and
reproducing apparatus. A write and read head (pickup head)
is inserted into one of the head insertion holes. The head 
insertion holes are closed and opened by sliding movement of
the shutter.The shutter is bent at its intermediate portion so as
to extend to the top and bottom of the cartridge to cover
the head insertion holes and two spindle holes. On the
insertion side of the cartridge into the recording and
reproducing apparatus, the shutter is slidingly moved along
a guide portion of the cartridge front edge to open and
close the insertion holes and the spindle holes.Also, the sliding movement of the shutter of the
conventional cartridge is not smooth, which would lead non-smooth
sliding contact between the shell and the shutter.EP 0 255 185 A1 discloses a disc cassette comprising an enclosure and a shutter which
is uniformly and easily movable and which can easily be mounted on the enclosure. This
is achieved by rigidly connecting the shutter to a slide 11 which is slidably connected to
the enclosure by parallel guide means.This document further discloses an omega type spring which acts on the slide. This spring
has a first straight arm connected to the tip end of the slide, and a second arm comprising a
first extension portion extending substantially tangentially from the coil portion of the spring,
and a second portion bent from the first extension portion, an a distal end connected to the
front edge of the disc cartridge.It is the object of the invention to provide a disc
</DESCRIPTION>
<CLAIMS>
A disc cartridge for encasing therein a recording medium disc, said disc
cartridge having a front edge to be inserted into a recording or reproducing

apparatus;

a shutter (6) slidably mounted on said disc cartridge for opening and closing
at least one head insertion hole (5) formed in said disc cartridge, said shutter

(6) including a head portion (13) slidably movable along said front edge of
said disc cartridge, said head portion having opening and closing plate

portions (11) extending from both sides thereof;
a guide portion (G) formed in said front edge of said disc cartridge;
a slider (14) slidingly guided within said guide portion (G) for supporting said
shutter; and
a return coil spring (10) for biasing the shutter (6) through said slider to a position
where said shutter closes said head insertion hole (5);
wherein said return coil spring (10) is composed of an elastic wire coiled portion
(41) having two arms (42, 43) extending therefrom and is located within a corner

of the disc cartridge; and

wherein

one of said arms (43) is composed of a first extension portion (43a) extending
substantially tangentially from said coiled portion (41) and of a second extension

portion (43b) bent from said first extension portion;
said second extension portion (43b) comprises a longitudinal extending portion
(43b1), a lateral extending portion (43b2) bent back from said longitudinal

extending portion and a first retainer portion (43b3) bent in a right angle from said
lateral extending portion and being connected to the tip end of the slider (14); and
that the other arm (42) is composed of a third extension portion (42a) extending
tangentially from said coiled portion (41) and of a fourth extension portion (42b)

bent from said third extension portion, wherein the fourth extension portion
comprises a distal end which is connected to the front edge of said disc cartridge.
The disc cartridge according to claim 1, 
characterized in that
 the radius ( r )
of curvature of a bent portion between said third extension portion (42a) and

said fourth extension portion (42b) is within a range of 0.8 to 3 mm.
The disc cartridge according to claim 1 or 2, 
characterized in that
 said fourth
extension portion (42b) forms a trapezoidal crest shape with the third

extension portion (42a) and comprises:

a jump portion (42b3) extending from the distal end of the trapezoidal crest
shape, and
a second retainer portion (42b4) being bent in a right angle for being
connected with the front edge of the disc cartridge, wherein said second

retainer portion is being extended in a direction opposite the direction of said
first retainer portion (43b3) of the second extension portion.
The disc cartridge according to one of claims 1 to 3, 
characterized in that
the tip end of the slider is in the form of a projected roof (20); 
a guide groove (30') is formed on the under surface of the projected roof and
includes a slanted surface (30a) for guiding a distal end (10a) of one arm of the

return coil spring (10) to a receiving portion (33) which is located in a retraced
position from the front end of the projected roof; and
the distal end (10a) is received in a recess portion (33a) formed within the
receiving portion (33) after being guided through a cutout (32) which is formed on

the bottom wall of the slider (14).
The disc cartridge according to claim 4, 
characterized in that
 a projection
(31 a) is provided along the cutout (32) in the receiving portion (33) for guiding

the distal end of the return coil spring (10) into the recess portion (33a) and
for preventing the distal end once introduced into the recess portion from

being pulled apart therefrom.
