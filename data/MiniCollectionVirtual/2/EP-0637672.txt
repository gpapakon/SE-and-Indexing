<ABSTRACT>
A glazed unit (20) having three sheets includes a pair 
of outer glass sheets (22,24) secured to outer legs of a spacer (30) 

having a generally U-shaped cross section. On the base (42) of 
the spacer between the outer legs is provided a layer (38) of 

pliable material having a generally U-shaped cross section 
and having a desiccant therein. A third or intermediate 

glass sheet (26) has its edge portion in the groove (48) formed by the 
layer of pliable material. Movement of the third sheet (26) 

toward an outer glass sheet is limited by the cooperation of 
the layer (38) of the pliable material and portion of the outer 

legs of the spacer (30) at the corners of the unit (20) bent inwardly 
to move the layer (38) of pliable material at the corner toward 

the unit during fabrication of the unit. 
A nozzle for depositing the shaped layer of the 
pliable material includes a platform having a shaping tip. 

The shaping tip has converging sides at one end and 
generally parallel sides at the other end. The portion of 

the tip at the first end has a lower elevation than the 
portion of the tip at the second end. Holes for moving the 

pliable material are provided in the platform on each side 
of the tip and in tips in
termediate its ends. The different 
elevation and converging end minimizes if not eliminates 

tailing. 
A method is also discussed for making the triple 
glazed unit using the nozzling to provide the shaped layer 

of pliable material. An injector arrangement fills the unit 
with an insulating gas e.g. Argon.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a unit having
three or more sheets, and, in particular to a triple
unit having a pair of outer sheets separated by
an edge assembly, the edge
assembly including a spacer arrangement for supporting a
sheet between the outer sheets, and method of
making of the triple
unit.European Patent Application Publication Number
0 475 213 A1 published 18.03.92 Bulletin 92/12 (hereinafter
"The EP Application") based on U.S. Patent Applications
Serial Nos. 578,697 filed September 4, 1990; 578,696 filed
September 4, 1990, and 686,956 filed April 18, 1991, teaches
a glazing unit having an edge assembly having low thermal
conductivity and a method of making same. In general, The
EP Application teaches an insulating unit having a pair of
glass sheets about an edge assembly to provide a compartment
between the sheets. The edge assembly has a U-shaped spacer
that is moisture and/or gas impervious, and has materials
selected and sized to provide the edge assembly with a
predetermined RES-value (as defined and determined in the
disclosure of The EP Application). The EP Application
further discloses a triple glazed unit having a low thermal
conducting edge.U.S. Patent No. 4,149,348 teaches a technique for
making a triple glazed unit. In general, the triple glazed
unit includes a pair of outer glass sheets separated by a
spacer-dehydrator element, or metal spacer, having a groove
to maintain a third glass sheet between the outer two glass
sheets. Although the triple glazed unit taught in U.S. Patent No. 4,149,348 is
acceptable, there are limitations. More particularly, the spacer-dehydrator
element is structurally stable and is formed with a groove
prior to its use. The spacer has desiccant therein; therefore it is
stored in a dry environment to prevent absorption of moisture by the
desiccant. The metal spacer has to be formed to have groove; the
additional forming increases the fabrication cost of the spacer.
Further, the groove formed in the spacer disclosed in U.S. Patent No.
4,149,348 maintains the third glass sheet spaced from the outer sheets;
therefore, the groove has to be properly sized to prevent movement of
the inner sheet relative to the outer sheets.According to FR 79.993 there is provided a glazing unit comprising two
or three glass sheets arranged between two profiles.
In one embodiment the glazing unit as a
generally U-shaped metallic spacer which is arranged between the two
outer glass sheets. A third and intermediate glass sheet is held by an
elastic mounting within said spacer. The
