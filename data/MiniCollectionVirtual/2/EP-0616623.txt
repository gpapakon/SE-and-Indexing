<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an improved process for
the preparation of polymeric products from polyester resins
and polymers containing reactive end groups.The polymeric alloys from polyester resins and from resins
such as polycarbonate, polyamides were so far obtained by
blending in the molten state optionally operating in the
presence of functional compounds able to react with the
resin end groups.The properties of these alloys are not satisfactory due to
side reactions such as transesterification, transamidation
and degradation, which occur in the molten state. Due to
the degradation reactions, it was not possible moreover to
prepare resins with molecular weight high enough to enable
good mechanical properties of the polymeric alloys.EP-A-0 422 282 discloses a method for increasing the molecular
weight of aromatic polyester resins by polycondensing
the resins in the solid state in the presence of a dianhydride
of a tetracarboxylic acid.JP-A-1 272 660 discloses the extrusion of a blend of a
polyester and a polyamide resin in the presence of a dianhydride
of a tetracarboxylic acid.A method has now been found which allows to prepare polymeric
products with unexpectedly high mechanical properties
by reacting resins mixtures in the solid state in the presence
of polyfunctional compound containing at least two
groups capable of reacting with addition reactions with the 
resins end groups.The polyester resin, the resin containing reactive groups
and the functional compound are blended in the molten
state; the mixture is then pelletized and the chips are
then subjected to the solid state polyaddition reaction.The polyaddition reaction in the solid state is generally
preceded by a crystallization step carried out after the
melt state mixture stage and after the following pelletizing. 
The crystallization step is carried out to prevent agglomeration
phenomena of chips and/or of sticking on the
reactor wall during the reaction in the solid state.The crystallization step is carried out at temperatures higher
than the TG of the polyester and comprised in general
between 130째 and 180째C.The process of preparation is preferably carried out
in continuous way using continuous crystallizers and polyaddition
reactors where the chips are fed counter currently to
a stream of a heated gas, e.g. air, nitrogen and other inert
gas, such as carbon dioxide. The polyaddition reaction in
the solid state is carried out at temperatures higher than
150째C and lower than the melting pbint of the polyester resins.
