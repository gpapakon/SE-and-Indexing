<ABSTRACT>
Franking machine containing a first so-called "head" part containing franking means controlled by a first microprocessor (50), a keyboard (22) and a display (21) and a second so-called "base" part containing a second microprocessor (53), the first and second microprocessors implementing, in a so-called "normal" mode of operation, a communication protocol adapted so as to cause messages representing at least some of the commands input at the keyboard (22) to be transmitted to the base and to cause the commands executable by the head to be retransmitted from the base to the head, so that, from the keyboard (22) of the head, it is not possible to control at least certain functions unless the commands relating to such functions travel via the base (12).

<CLAIMS>
Franking machine having a first part (11) called the
"head" and a second part (12) called the "base", a keyboard

(22) and a display (21) both associated with the first part,
and communication means (51, 54; 17a, 17b) connecting these

two parts, the head (11) having a first microprocessor (50)
arranged to manage a printing means and a memory, certain

registers of which are assigned to the management of postal
data, so that the postal data can be modified only to record

frankings actually printed by the printing means, and so that
the printing means cannot print any franking unless these

frankings are accounted for by modifying the postal data in at
least some of the said registers; the first microprocessor

(50) also managing the keyboard and the display as well as the
part (51) of the said communication means intended to transmit

messages to the base (12) and to receive messages therefrom,
the base having a second microprocessor (53) arranged so that

it manages communication means (54) intended to transmit and
to receive messages to or from the head (11), a machine

characterised in that the first (50) and second (53)
microprocessors implement, in a so-called "normal" operating

mode, a communications protocol adapted to have transmitted to
the base messages representing at least some of the commands

entered on the keyboard (22) and to have transmitted from the
base to the head the commands executable by the latter, in

such a way that, from the keyboard (22) of the head, at least
certain functions cannot be commanded unless the commands

relating to such functions pass through the base (12).
Franking machine having a first part (11) called the
"head" and a second part (12) called the "base", a keyboard

(22) and a display (21) associated with the first part, and
communication means (51, 54; 17a, 17b) connecting these two 

parts; the head having a first microprocessor (50) arranged to
manage a printing means and a memory, certain registers of

which are assigned to the management of postal data, so that
the postal data can be modified only to record frankings

actually printed by the printing means, and so that the
printing means cannot print any franking unless the frankings

are accounted for by modifying the postal data in at least
some of the said registers, this microprocessor also managing

the keyboard (22), the display (21) associated with the said
head, and the part of said communication means associated with

the head and intended to transmit (51a) or respectively
receive (51b) messages to or respectively from the base (12),

the latter having a second microprocessor (53) arranged in
such a way that it manages the part of the said communication

means associated with the base and intended to transmit or
respectively receive messages to or respectively from the head

(11), a machine characterised in that on the one hand the said
first microprocessor (50) is arranged so that, in a so-called

"normal" operating mode, it identifies the key or keys pressed
(101), and has one or more messages representing the

identification transmitted (103) to the base by the said
communication means (51), while, on the other hand, the said

second microprocessor is arranged to interpret the messages
received (116), and to have transmitted (118, 108, 106),

through the said communication means, one or more messages
representing orders executable by the first microprocessor, in

such a way that it is not possible, from the keyboard of the
head, in the said normal operating mode, to command any

function at least related to the franking unless the command
for these functions passes through the base (12).
Franking machine according to Claim 1, characterised in
that the head (11) also has, in its program memory,

instructions enabling it to detect codes relating to keys or
combinations of keys received from the keyboard (22)

corresponding to orders executable by the microprocessor (50)
of the head (11), the program providing that, in the case of 

recognition of a combination relating to an order executable
by the said first microprocessor, this order is executed

(132).
Machine according to any one of Claims 1, 2 or 3,
characterised in that the microprocessor of the head (11)

stores, in an area of its memory associated with the said
keyboard buffer, and keeps updated, a binary word identifying

all the non-numeric keys which have been pressed since the
last erase order of this binary word.
Machine according to Claim 4, in which the said binary
word also identifies the pressing of at least one numeric key.
Machine according to either one of Claims 4, 5,
characterised in that the program of the microprocessor of the

head (11) includes instructions so that any pressing of
certain non-numeric keys of the keyboard (22) of the head (11)

causes the sending of a message by the communication means,
this message transmitting the said binary word to the base

(12).
Machine according to any one of Claims 4 to 6,
characterised in that the program of the microprocessor (53)

of the base (12) includes instructions enabling it to identify
any non-numeric key or keys that may be contained in the

messages received, such identification then causing the
sending of a message to erase the said binary word in the

memory associated with the microprocessor of the head (11).
Machine according to any one of Claims 4 to 7,
characterised in that the program of the microprocessor of the

base (12) includes instructions enabling it to identify, among
the non-numeric keys defined by the binary word received, the

one which was pressed last and has caused the sending of the
message. 
Machine according to Claim 8, characterised in that the
program of the microprocessor of the base (12) includes

instructions assigning a precise meaning to the said non-numeric
key pressed last.
Machine according to any one of Claims 1 to 9,
characterised in that some of the messages concerning the

keyboard (22) are messages which are intended to inhibit or
activate certain keys.
Machine according to any one of Claims 1 to 10,
characterised in that some messages concerning the memory

associated with the microprocessor of the head (11) are
messages commanding the reading of an area of the said memory,

specified within these messages, and commanding the sending of
a message in return containing these read data.
Machine according to any one of Claims 1 to 11,
characterised in that some messages concerning the memory

associated with the microprocessor of the head (11) are
messages commanding the writing of specified data at the

specified addresses of the said memory, the addresses
including sensitive data which cannot be specified because of

instructions from the program of the microprocessor of the
base (12).
Machine according to any one of Claims 1 to 12,
characterised in that the program of the microprocessor of the

head (11) is provided with instructions prohibiting the

execution of write messages at the addresses containing
sensitive data.
