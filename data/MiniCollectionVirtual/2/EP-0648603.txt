<ABSTRACT>
A process for producing a support for a photographic 
printing paper which comprises melt-extrusion laminating 

a polyester resin composition on one side or both sides 
of a base paper using a vent-extruder having a vent hole. 

The polyester resin has an intrinsic viscosity of from 
0.4 to 1.3 (25°C) and a specific surface area of 10 cm²/g 

or higher. During the melt-extrusion laminating at least 
one vent-hole of the extruder is evacuated.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a process for producing 
a support for a photographic printing paper by melt-extrusion 
laminating a polyester resin composition on a 
paper support. The process of the present invention provides 
a stable laminate, prevents a reduction in viscosity of 
a melted resin, allows for use of both a resin and a pigment 
without drying, and does away with the need to use master 
pellets containing a large amount of pigment. Hitherto, in a support for a photographic printing 
paper, a polyolefin layer containing titanium dioxide pigment 
dispersed therein is coated on the surface side of a base 
paper having an emulsion layer, and a polyolefin layer which 
does not contain a pigment is laminated on the opposite 
surface side of the base paper to increase optical reflection 
and to impart water resistance. The effect of water 
contained in a polyolefin resin and a pigment during a melt-extruding 
lamination is described as follows. The polyolefin 
resin has a small water absorption and the water content of 
the pigment is also very small. Consequently, the water 
contained in the resin and the pigment does not promote 
decomposition of the resin. Accordingly, the melt-extrusion 
lamination step using a polyolefin resin is stable.  When a pigment-containing polyolefin resin is used 
for lamination, polyolefin resin master pellets containing a 
large amount of pigment are prepared in advance using a 
Banbury mixer or other mixer. When laminating, the master 
pellets are added to the polyolefin resin in an amount 
required for obtaining the desired pigment concentration in 
an extruder. This technique is called the master-batching 
method. When a film base or other products are produced from 
a polyester resin, the polyester resin is sufficiently dried 
to adjust the water content to about several tens of ppm. In 
this manner, the reduction of viscosity of the polyester 
resin due to hydrolyzation can be prevented. As a result, 
the properties and the melting state of the polyester resin 
are well maintained during melt-extrusion. The present inventors previously developed a 
photographic printing paper support comprising a base paper 
laminated with a polyester resin as disclosed, for example, 
in JP-A-5-127309 and JP-A-5-204091. (The term "JP-A" as used 
herein means an unexamined published Japanese patent 
application.) However, a polyester resin is inferior to a 
polyolefin resin (e.g., a polyethylene resin). That is, in 
laminating the polyester resin, the fluctuation of the
