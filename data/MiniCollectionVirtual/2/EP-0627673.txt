<ABSTRACT>
A refurbished toner cartridge (10) includes a cover (12) having 
elongated side dimensions with integral flanges and a mating bottle (14) also 

having elongated side flanges, the flanges bonded to create an interior volume 
(23) for holding a print toner. At one end of the cartridge is a toner fill opening 

(22) which enables access into the interior volume (23). The refurbished 
cartridge (10) further comprises a flexible bladder (24) that is inserted through 

the fill opening (22) and is positioned within the interior volume (23) of the 
cartridge (10). Toner is contained in the bladder (24) and is released upon the 

bladder (24) being ruptured by user actuation of either an internal knife blade 
(72) or a pull string (30) attached to the bladder (24).

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a refurbished toner cartridge and more particularly to
replaceable toner cartridges for use with
electrostatic printers and copiers and, to an
apparatus for enabling reuse of used toner cartridges.Laser printers and electrostatic copiers employ toner cartridges
that contain a supply of toner material for use during the electrostatic
development process. The cartridges are designed to be replaced from time to
time, to replenish the toner that is used during the printing process. Such toner
cartridges include an elongated toner container (called a "bottle") and a cover
that includes a charging rod and an electrostatic magnetic roller assembly. The
bottle and cover have flanges that mate and are bonded along their elongated
dimensions to create a singular cartridge structure. At one end of the cartridge,
the flanges are not bonded, but rather include a foam seal through which a
toner "dam" tear strip extends. When the toner cartridge is first used, the tear
strip is removed by pulling it through the foam seal, thereby causing removal of
an internal dam that covers the bottle portion of the cartridge, thereby rendering
accessible the toner contained therein.While toner cartridges were initially designed to be discarded after
the original toner supply was exhausted, certain cartridge portions, (i.e., the
magnetic roller and charging rod) have longer useful lives. Thus, a market has
developed for refurbished cartridges that have been refilled with a supply of
toner. However, replacement toner dams have generally been unsatisfactory as
they have enabled leakage of refilled toner.In EP-A-0 672 672
"TONER CARTRIDGE TONER DAM REPLACEMENT AND METHOD THEREFOR",
a plurality of improved toner dams and methods
for their insertion into used toner cartridges are disclosed. U.S. Patent
5,080,745 to Paull also discloses a replacement toner dam for insertion into a 
used toner cartridge. Each of the toner dams shown in the above noted
european application and in Paull require either the insertion of a replacement
toner dam through the above described foam seal in the end of a cartridge or,
require disassembly of the cartridge.All toner cartridges are provided with a fill opening at one end
through which toner is initially loaded during manufacture. If a new toner dam
could be inserted through the fill opening, the resulting refurbishment procedure
would be simplified over that shown in the prior art. JP-A-62 218974 discloses a developing device having a
developer cartridge which seals the

<CLAIMS>
A refurbished toner cartridge (10; 126) including a
mating cover (12) and a bottle (14) which, together, define an

interior volume for said toner cartridge (10; 126),
said toner cartridge having an elongated dimension and

further comprising:

a flexible bladder (24; 88; 100; 120) positioned within said

interior volume and containing toner;
a toner fill opening (22) for introducing said flexible
bladder (24; 88; 100; 120) into said interior volume; and
opening means (30, 32, 36; 72; 102) passing from within said
toner cartridge (10; 126) to outside said toner cartridge

and cooperating with said flexible bladder (24; 88; 100; 120) and
operable by an user from outside said toner cartridge (10;

126);

characterized in that
said opening means is movable by said user in a direction
of said elongated dimension so as to create an opening in

said flexible bladder (24; 88; 100; 120) to enable escape of said
toner into said interior volume and
said toner cartridge (10; 126) further comprises frame
means (40) positioned within said flexible bladder (24; 88; 100; 120) for

maintaining said flexible bladder (24; 120) in a non-collapsed
configuration.
A refurbished toner cartridge as recited in claim 1
wherein said frame means (40) includes flexible elongated

frame struts (42,44,46) positioned between first and second
(48) ring-shaped ends, and wherein the elongated dimension of 

said frame means (40) exceeds the elongated dimension of said
interior volume said frame means (40) being compressed by a

first end wall at a first end of said bottle (14) when
inserted into said interior volume, said flexible

elongated frame struts (42,44,46) thereby being bowed outwardly
towards side walls of said bottle (14).
The refurbished toner cartridge (10) as recited in
claim 2 wherein said toner fill opening (22) is a flanged

aperture (54) formed into a second end of said bottle (14),
said flexible bladder (24) and frame means (40) being

insertable through said flanged aperture (54) into said
interior volume the open end (26) of said flexible

bladder (24) being folded over an opening (52) in said
second ring-shaped end (48) of said frame means (40) and

held in place against said second ring-shaped end (48) by
ring clip means (50) which fits within said opening (52) and

bears against said folded over portion of said flexible bladder (24).
The refurbished toner cartridge (10) as recited in
claim 3 wherein, when said frame means (40) is positioned

within said interior volume (23), said first ring-shaped end
of said frame means (40) bears against said first end wall

of said interior volume that opposes said flanged
aperture (54) and positions said second ring-shaped end (48)

of said frame means in registration with said flanged
aperture (54) when said frame means (40) is held in

compression, said ring clip means (50) further forcing said
second ring-shaped end (48) of said frame means (40) against

said flanged aperture (54) so as to maintain said
compression of said frame means (40).
The refurbished toner cartridge (10) as recited in
claim 1 wherein said opening means comprises a string (30)

bonded to a weakened portion (36) of said flexible bladder
(24), said string (30) being accessible to an user outside

said toner cartridge (10) and, when pulled, causing a
rupture of said weakened portion (36) of said flexible 

bladder (24).
The refurbished toner cartridge as recited in claim
1 wherein said opening means comprises a cutter blade (72)

that is slideably positioned on a rod (70) within said
interior volume, said cutter blade (72) further being connected to

a handle (74) that is positioned external to said toner
cartridge (10), actuation of said handle (74) by an user

causing translation of said cutter blade (72) along said rod
(70) and a resultant cutting of an opening into said

flexible bladder (88) by action of said cutter blade (72).
The refurbished toner cartridge as recited in claim
1 wherein said flexible bladder (100) is preformed to the

shape of said interior volume, so that when inserted into
said interior volume and expanded, said preformed bladder

(100) fills said interior volume, said preformed bladder
(100) further being provided with a weakened section that is

attached to a pull strip (102), said pull strip (102) being
accessible by an user from outside said toner cartridge

(10).
The refurbished toner cartridge as recited in claim
1, wherein said frame means is a shape retainer means (122)

positioned within said flexible bladder (120) to cause said
bladder (120) to remain in an extended configuration as said

toner (124) is utilized.
