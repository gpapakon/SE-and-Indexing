<ABSTRACT>
A magnetic recording medium comprising a nonmagnetic supporting layer and, formed thereon, a magnetic 
layer comprising a ferromagnetic powder dispersed in a binder. The binder is composed of 30-70 wt.% of a 

polyurethane resin A having a glass transition temperature (Tg) satisfying the condition: 60 °C ≦ Tg ≦ 80 °C 
and another polyurethane resin B having a glass transition temperature (Tg) satisfying the condition: 0 °C 
<
 Tg ≦ 30 
°C. At least one of the polyurethane resins has polar groups and the total amount of the resins A and B is 80-100 wt.% 

based on the binder. This medium has a good calenderability and excellent electromagnetic transduction performance, 
is reduced in dust dropping especially from the tape edge at ordinary temperatures, and has an excellent travelling 

stability in a high-temperature atmosphere.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a magnetic recording
medium such as magnetic tape.A problem with a coated type of magnetic recording medium
including a magnetic layer having ferromagnetic powders
dispersed in a binder is that the constituents forming the
magnetic layer such as ferromagnetic powders come off during
repeated running.As recording density increases, it is required to increase
recording frequency and, hence, to place the gap between the
magnetic layer and a magnetic head under precise control. So
far, attention has been paid only to detachment of powders from
the overall surface of the magnetic layer in sliding contact
with a magnetic head. However, it has now been found that even
a slight amount of powders coming off the edges of tape has an
adverse influence on the gap between the magnetic recording
tape and the associated magnetic head. For instance, this
makes an error rate likely to increase in recording digital
signals on digital compact cassette (DCC) or other tape, and so
offers a problem in view of practical use. There is thus a
strong demand for the development of a magnetic recording 
medium which makes powders more unlikely to come off than ever
before.Various proposals have so far been made to prevent powders
from coming off. For instance, JP-A 1-118213 proposes to
incorporate in a binder used for a magnetic layer polyurethane
resin having a glass transition temperature Tg of up to 0°C in
combination with polyurethane resin having Tg of 50°C or higher
and containing a polar group in its molecule. By the combined
use of the soft polyurethane resin having Tg of up to 0°C and
the resin having Tg of 50°C or higher and containing a polar
group it is possible not only to allow magnetic powders, etc.,
to be dispersed in the magnetic layer with high dispersibility,
but also to ensure good processability on calendering equipment
(or good susceptibility to calendering), so that abrasion loss
of the head, detachment of powders from the overall surface of
the magnetic layer, etc., can be reduced. Even when the binder
having such composition as set forth in the above publication
is used, however, much difficulty is involved in preventing
detachment of powders from the edges of tape to be referred to
hereinafter. In this connection, it is to be understood that
the results of studies made by the inventors teach that the use
of resin having Tg of 50°C or higher and containing a polar
group, especially, polyurethane resin makes it possible not
only to prevent detachment of powders from the
