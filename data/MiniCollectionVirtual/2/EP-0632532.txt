<ABSTRACT>
An electrical connector assembly (2) for electrical 
connection to an electromagnetic valve assembly (4) 

subject to large amplitude vibratory movements, comprises 
a casing (16) and a plurality of connectors (28) mounted 

thereto via spring means (30). The connector assembly (2) 
also comprises a cover (26) and a sealing member (24) 

therearound whereby the casing (16), connectors (28), seal 
(24) and cover (26) can be assembled together as a single 

unit which is then matable to the magnet valve assembly 
comprising a plurality of corresponding magnet valves (12) 

mounted in a casing (6). When the connector assembly (2) 
and the valve assembly (4) are mated together, the 

connectors (28) are pushed against the valves (12) with a 
sufficient spring force to ensure that during large 

vibratory movements, terminals of the magnet valve mated 
with the terminals of the connector do not move relative 

to each other in order to avoid fretting corrosion and 
fatigue thereof.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to an electrical connector 
assembly for electrical connection between conducting 
wires and an electromagnetic valve mechanism, and in 
particular a connector assembly that prevents fretting 
corrosion between terminals thereof and the terminals of 
an electrical device having large amplitude vibratory 
movements such as antilock braking system magnet valves. Fretting corrosion is a common problem in electrical 
connectors especially in an automobile due to the 
abundance of vibrations. In order to overcome fretting 
corrosion between mating contacts of terminals, a terminal 
has been developed as described in European patent 
application publication 0492479 whereby the terminal 
contact is attached to the wire connection portion via a 
spring section that is very supple in the longitudinal 
direction, thus allowing the wire and terminal contact 
section to vibrate relative to the contact section which 
stays in a fixed mating relationship to a mating terminal. 
The latter solution works very well with vibrations of 
reasonable amplitude but may not work as effectively with 
large amplitudes of movement. This occurs for, example, 
during the functioning of electromagnetic antilock braking 
system valves, whereby during actuation of the valve, 
there are rapidly succeeding shock movements that may 
vibrate the magnet valves with amplitudes of around one 
millimeter. Such large amplitudes, may not only cause 
fretting corrosion of the contacts, but may also cause 
rupture of the terminals by cyclic fatigue. The 
functioning of antilock braking system valves must be very 
reliable as it relates to the security of people. These electromagnetic valves are often standard parts 
that are supplied by different manufacturers than those of 
the electrical connectors, which usually means that the  
 
electrical connectors must by adapted to conform with the 
available magnet valves. It would be desirable to provide a connector assembly 
that can be assembled at one location and then mounted to 
the magnet valves at another location. The latter would be 
particularly advantageous as it would allow the connector 
assembly to be manufactured in a semi automated or fully 
automated procedure and supplied as a complete assembly to 
the automobile manufacturer. In such a procedure, costs 
would not only be reduced, but the assembly could also be 
made in a more reliable manner as the connector assemblies 
could be individually tested at their site of manufacture. It would also be desirable to
