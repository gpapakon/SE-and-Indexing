<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an automatic assembling method for assembling a
photographic film cassette according to the preamble of claim 1, and to an automatic
assembling apparatus for assembling a photographic film cassette, according to the
preamble of claim 4.Photographic film of the 135 type, contained in a cassette, is among the most popular
formats of photographic film. A known 135 photographic film cassette has a cassette
shell constituted of a cylindrical body and formed in a thin metal sheet and two caps
fitted thereon. The cassette has a spool contained in the cassette shell on which
photographic film is wound in a form of a roll. To assemble this photographic film
cassette, several methods are known.From prior art document US 4614019A a method and apparatus for assembling a film
cassette along an assembling line is known. Said apparatus comprises a conveying
means having a plurality of pallets which are intermittently conveyed along said
assembly line. Shell plate chucks are mounted on the pallets and are opened and
closed as the pallets move. Said chucks are provided to receive the shell plates of the
film cassette, wherein said shell plates have been temporarily formed within a shell plate
temporary forming station and thereafter said formed shell plates are supplied to the
assembling line. The respective shell plates held by said chucks are receiving spools
with film being wound thereon, respectively. Said spool and film have been
preassembled within a winding station and have been supplied to the assembling line.
Thereafter caps are supplied to said assembling line for closing the open ends of the
shell plates accommodating the spool and the film.US 4 080 711 A discloses a process of bringing an assembled cassette shell into a darkroom, 
disassembling the cassette shell for insertion of the
photographic film, inserting the photographic film wound on the
spool, and then assembling the cassette shell.U.S.P. 4,834,306, U.S.P. 4,846,418 and European
Publication EP-A2 0 406 815 (corresponding to Japanese Patent
Laid-open Publication No. 3-37645), each disclose a
photographic film cassette in which a cassette shell is
constituted of parts formed from resin, and rotation of a spool
causes a leader of the photographic film to exit to the outside
of the cassette. Such a leader-advancing cassette is different
from photographic film cassette conventionally in use because
the leader of the photographic film is fully contained within
the cassette both before exposure and after exposure. Such a
