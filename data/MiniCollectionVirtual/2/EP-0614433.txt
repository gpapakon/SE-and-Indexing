<ABSTRACT>
A crate (1) is provided with a bottom (2) with upright front walls (3) and sidewalls (4) connecting thereto. For nesting purposes in pairs, the front walls (3) and sidewalls (4) are provided with slits (7). These slits run from the top edge of the crate (1) towards the bottom. The bottom is further provided with locking elements (9, 10) for shift-free stacking of nested pairs of crates.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a container with a preferably 
rectangular bottom and upright front and side walls connecting thereto. Such open-top containers, such as crates, are used for, for 
example, packing and transporting bulk or loose goods, such as tuberous 
or bulbous plants. Such crates are stacked on top of each other by 
placing the bottom of the next crate on the open top edge of the previous 
crate. For the greatest possible stacking height with the most efficient 
material use possible, combined with the optimum ratio between the 
internal volume and the external cubic measurements, it is necessary in 
this connection that in a stack of crates the upright front and side 
walls run vertically as far as possible, since these walls are subjected 
to pressure. Such crates with rectangular flat bottom and side walls 
perpendicular thereto, made of, for example, wood or plastic, have 
already been in use in large quantities for many purposes for a long 
time. The disadvantage of these known crates is that when they are 
stacked empty they take up as much space as when they are full. This is a 
disadvantage as regards, for example, the required storage space for 
empty crates or transporting them. AT-A-382 581 constitutes the state of the 
art on which the preamble of claim 1 
is based. It is the object of the invention to provide a container 
having amended stacking characteristics. The technical solution for this object 
is defined by the features indicated in 
the characterising portion of claim 1. Such containers according to the invention can easily be nested 
in pairs, with the result that the space taken up by empty containers 
compared with full ones is almost halved. Despite these nestable 
properties, the stacking strength and ease of handling of the known 
container are maintained, without additional measures having to be taken 
for the purpose. This means that it is possible, for example, to use 
existing containers and containers according to the present invention 
with the same dimensions interchangeably for normal applications, such as 
stacking filled containers on top of each other. In certain embodiments of the invention it is even possible to  
 
a limited degree to nest a container according to the present invention 
with a conventional container with corresponding measurements. The slits preferably extend over approximately half the height 
of the container, each upright wall being provided with two slits, each 
in the corners of the container where the side walls connect to each
</DESCRIPTION>
<CLAIMS>
Container (1) with a substantially rectangular bottom (2) and 
upright front (3) and side (4) walls connecting thereto, the respective, 

adjacent front (3) and side (4) walls defining the side corners of the container, the container 
comprising four first slits; two in one of the front walls (3) at 

or close to the respective corners thereof, and one provided in each side wall 
(4) at the respective corner opposite said one front wall (3), said 

first slits (7) extending in a perpendicular direction 
from the free top edge of the respective wall towards the 

bottom, 
over at least a part of the height of the 

container (1) 
said slits being provided over the 

full wall thickness, and having such a width that respective 
front and side walls of a second container are nestable within 

said slits, 
characterized in that
, the 
container further comprises four second slits (7) extending parallel to to said first slits, 

two of said second slits being 
provided in the other of said front walls (3) at or close to 

the respective corners thereof, 
the other two of said second slits being 

provided in each of said side walls 
(4) at or close to the edge of the containers 

where said respective first slits of 
said one of the front walls are 

provided, 
such that at or close to each corner there are provided both a first and 

a second slit (7). 
Container according to Claim 1, 
characterized in that
, said 
first and second slits (7) at each corner define a pair of identical slits. 
Container according to claim 1 or 2, 
characterized in that
, 
the slits (7) extend over at least half of the height of the container.
