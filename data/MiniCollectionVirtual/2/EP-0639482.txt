<ABSTRACT>
The deployable door (D) of a passenger-side vehicle 
airbag restraint system is simultaneously fastened into an 

instrument panel opening and into engagement with the 
airbag module reaction canister. A spring clip (14) on 

the canister receives a probe (26) which is secured to the 
door through a pivoted breakaway connection (24,28). The probe is 

easily inserted into the clip (14) but can be withdrawn only 
with difficulty. Airbag inflation thereafter separates the 

breakaway connection preferentially to the spring clip 
connection.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to the field of automotive
airbag restraint systems. More particularly, it relates to the
interconnection between the airbag reaction canister and the
airbag deployment door of the instrument panel.In passenger side airbag restraint systems, the airbag
reaction canister is mounted behind the vehicle's instrument
panel. A portion of the instrument panel forms a deployment door
which is designed to break away under the influence of the
inflating airbag. It is crucial to the airbag operation that the
door completely separates from the instrument panel and moves out
of the way of the inflating bag. However, it is also important
that the door fit snugly into the instrument panel so as to
present an aesthetically pleasing appearance.It has been difficult to achieve these objectives
during the vehicle assembly or upon airbag replacement. 
A system for fastening an instrument panel deployment door of an
automotive airbag restraint system simultaneously into an opening
in an instrument panel and into engagement with an airbag module
reaction canister which comprises snap fastening means
is known from US - A - 5 211 421.
The snap fastening means require
relatively precise positioning to assure proper alignment of the
door. Accordingly, it is a primary object of the present
invention to provide a snap fastening system which permits 
substantial flexibility between a connector on the reaction can
and a connector on the door but holds the door firmly in position
on installation by the assembler. Another object is to permit
the breakaway force to be varied for different installations.
Other objects, features, and advantages will become apparent from
the following description and the appended claims.A system is provided for fastening an instrument panel
deployment door of an automotive airbag restraint system simultaneously
into the instrument panel opening and into engagement
with the airbag module reaction canister. A spring clip is
mounted on either the reaction canister or the deployment door.
The clip defines an opening which is adapted to receive an
elongated probe which is inserted therethrough. It is also
resistant to subsequent withdrawal of the probe. A base member
is mounted on the other of the canister and deployment door. An
elongated probe has a first end which pivotally engages the base
member. It is forcibly detachable therefrom. A second end of
the probe member is adapted to enter the opening of the clip as
the deployment door is positioned into the instrument panel
opening.A

<CLAIMS>
A system for fastening an instrument panel
deployment door (D) of an automotive airbag restraint

system simultaneously into an opening in an instrument
panel (P) and into engagement with an airbag module

reaction canister (C) which comprises:

a spring clip (14) mounted on one of said reaction
canister and deployment door, said clip defining an opening

(18) adapted to receive an elongated probe inserted
therethrough but resistant to subsequent withdrawal of said

probe;
a base member (22) mounted to the other of said
reaction canister and deployment door; and
an elongated probe member (26) having a first end
pivotally engaging said base member but forcibly detachable

therefrom and a second end (36) adapted to enter the
opening of said clip upon positioning of said deployment

door into said instrument panel opening.
A system according to claim 1 wherein said
spring clip (14) is mounted on said reaction canister (C).
A system according to claim 1 or claim 2
wherein one of said base member (22) and probe member (26)

defines a substantially cylindrical socket (24) and the
other carries a cylinder (28) enclosed by said socket. 
A system according to claim 3 wherein the
socket (24) is defined by said base member (22).
A system according to claim 3 or claim 4
wherein said cylinder is substantially hollow and

bifurcated.
A system according to any preceding claim
wherein the opening (18) in said spring clip is defined by

at least one margin which is deformable by insertion of
said elongated probe.
A system according to claim 6 wherein said
margin is serrated (20).
An automotive airbag restraint system of the
type including an airbag module reaction canister (C)

positioned behind an instrument panel deployment door (D),
comprising a system for fastening said door as defined in claim 1, wherein


at least one spring clip (14) is mounted on said
reaction canister, said clip defining an opening (18)

deformable upon insertion of an elongated probe (34)
therethrough to resist subsequent withdrawal of said probe;
at least one substantially cylindrical socket (24)
carried by said deployment door; and
an elongated locking member (26) having a first end
defining a cylinder (28) seatable in said cylindrical 

socket and a second end (36) forming a probe insertable
into the opening of said spring clip,
whereby inflation of the airbag of said restraint
system separates the cylinder (28) from the socket (24) and

permits the door to deploy.
An airbag restraint system according to claim 8
wherein said cylinder (28) is substantially hollow and

bifurcated.
An airbag restraint system according to claim
8 or claim 9 wherein said probe is made of plastics

material.
An airbag restraint system according to any
one of claims 8 to 10 wherein said spring clip is metal.
