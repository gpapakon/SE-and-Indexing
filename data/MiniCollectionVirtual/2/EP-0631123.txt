<ABSTRACT>
An apparatus and a method for measuring and controlling 
the crack growth rate within a double cantilever 

beam type test specimen (50). The arms (51,52) of the test 
specimen are fitted with a pressure-actuated bellows (62) to 

induce a predetermined load and with a sensing assembly (70) 
to provide feedback on the amount of beam displacement 

resulting from application of that load. In this manner 
a loaded test specimen may be remotely mounted and 

adjusted inside the reactor pressure vessel or piping 
of a nuclear reactor in order to maintain a stress 

intensity which is constant or which varies in a 
predetermined manner for inducing stress corrosion 

cracking or corrosion fatigue in the specimen.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention is directed to sensors that measure 
and monitor damage to structural components within aggressive 
service environments. More particularly, it 
is directed to double-cantilever beam sensors for 
measuring crack growth in structural components. Exposing structural material to an aggressive 
environment under steady or cyclic stress can cause 
damage in the form of cracking. This result is generally 
referred to as stress corrosion cracking ("SCC") 
or corrosion fatigue. For example, metallic alloys used 
as structural members often operate under sustained or 
cyclic stress and in high-temperature, oxygenated water, 
such as that found in boiling water reactors (BWRs), 
where temperatures and pressures exceed 280°C and 1000 
psi, respectively. The BWR environment may also be 
radioactive and provide only limited space to accommodate 
the placement of a sensor to monitor SCC. Damage in the form of SCC, or other stress/environment 
induced cracking, is of greater concern to the 
nuclear industry. The problems which industry faces in 
attempting to predict the onset of, or susceptibility 
of particular structural components to SCC under 
specific operating conditions are set out in U.S. Patent 
No. 4,677,855 to Coffin, Jr. et al. and U.S. Patent No. 
4,923,708 to Solomon et al., the disclosures of which  
 
are incorporated by reference herein. Methods for measuring crack growth which require 
test specimens to be removed from their testing environment 
have been disclosed over the years. These methods 
use a variety of monitoring systems including visual and 
electrical potential (voltage) drop measurements. The 
electrical potential drop method improved the art by 
enabling mathematical models to be generated which were 
effective in monitoring the rate of crack propagation 
in a specimen. These models are described in detail in 
the Coffin and Solomon patents. Material testing for SCC is often carried out using 
a specimen constructed in a double cantilever beam (DCB) 
geometry, which has a machined slot at its root notch. 
The bifurcate specimen is then loaded to force apart the 
beams of the DCB, e.g., using an electrically nonconductive 
wedge, thereby inducing crack growth at the 
machined slot. The rate of crack growth may be monitored 
and used to assess the aggressiveness of the 
specimen's environment. Preferably, the intensity of the applied stress, 
termed the "stress intensity factor", remains constant 
at the leading edge of the crack. The rate of crack 
growth would then be
