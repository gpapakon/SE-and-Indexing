<ABSTRACT>
The present invention relates to a process for 
preparing a beta-phase metal phthalocyanine pigments in which 


(a) a crude metal phthalocyanine having an average particle 
size of about 10 to about 200 µm is dry milled until the 

average particle size is reduced to about 0.01 to about 
0.5 µm; 
(b) the milled metal phthalocyanine is finished by thoroughly 
mixing said metal phthalocyanine with at least about 4 

parts by weight, relative to the metal phthalocyanine, of 
a finishing solvent containing a mixture of 


(i) about 5 to 100 percent by weight, based on the total 
amount of finishing solvent, of a monocarboxylic acid 

monoester, dicarboxylic acid diester, diol diester, 
lactone, or cyclic carbonate, or a mixture thereof, 

and 
(ii) 0 to about 95 percent by weight, based on the total 
amount of finishing solvent, of water; 
(c) the ester used in step (b) is hydrolyzed; and 
(d) the beta-phase metal phthalocyanine pigment is collected.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a process for the 
preparation of easily dispersible pigments of the beta-phase 
modification of metal phthalocyanine pigments, especially that 
of copper phthalocyanines. This process provides a simple and 
cost-effective method for manufacturing soft green-shade blue 
pigments having high color strength. Crude copper phthalocyanine is usually prepared by a 
reaction of phthalic anhydride or a derivative thereof, urea, 
and a copper source, or by a reaction of phthalonitrile or a 
derivative thereof and a copper source in an organic solvent, 
optionally in the presence of ammonium or titanium salts (such 
as titanium tetrachloride). The resultant phthalocyanine 
particles, however, undergo crystal growth during preparation 
and have a major axis of about 10 to about 200 µm. Such copper 
phthalocyanines have little or no color value as a pigment for 
use in inks, coating compositions, plastics, and the like. For 
this reason, the crude copper phthalocyanine must be milled to 
obtain a high color value. Pigment milled in this way has a 
particle size of about 0.01 to about 0.5 µm and is a mixture of 
alpha and beta phases. The milled pigment is then recrystallized 
(or "finished") in a mixture of water and an organic 
solvent to provide optimum color properties of the beta-phase 
green-shade blue pigment. Several methods have been described for preparing 
pigments having improved color value but these methods 
typically produce mixtures of alpha- and beta-crystal forms or 
require the use of special additives or solvent mixtures. For example, British Patent 1,502,884 discloses a 
one-step process for preparing dispersible pigments of the 
beta-modification of copper phthalocyanine in which a coarser 
form of highly purified beta-phase copper phthalocyanine is  
 
ground in an organic liquid (optionally containing water) in 
the presence of certain phthalocyanine derivatives that improve 
dispersibility of the pigment. U.S. Patent 4,104,276 discloses the use of certain 
copper phthalocyanine derivatives as additives to inhibit 
"overcrystallization" when milled phthalocyanine pigments are 
recrystallized in organic or aqueous organic solvents. U.S. Patent 4,104,277 discloses a process for 
preparing an alpha-phase or beta-phase copper phthalocyanine 
pigment. A crude copper phthalocyanine is first dry milled 
(which increases the alpha phase relative to the beta phase) 
and then mixed with an emulsion containing an amine, water, and 
a surfactant. U.S. Patent 4,158,572 discloses
