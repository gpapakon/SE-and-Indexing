<ABSTRACT>
The cap consists of an upper piece (1) and of a lower piece (2) including a portion (8) projecting laterally relative to the midpoint diameter of the bottle (cylinder) (3) and including a cutout (12) which is open downwards allowing the cap/bottle assembly to be supported, by fastening, on a structural support element and having a transverse external profile with a large radius of curvature allowing the cap/bottle assembly to be placed flat on a surface. The upper part (1) has a carrying and handling handle (1) extending transversely substantially plumb with the laterally-projecting portion (8) and connected to the latter by two vertical ribs (23A). Application especially to small gas bottles, particularly for medical oxygen.

<CLAIMS>
Assembly constituted by a gas bottle (3) and a bottle
cap and comprising a lower part (2) mounted on the bottle

(3) and an upper part (1) defining internally a space
(20-19) shielding a gas-distributing valve structure (4)

integral with the bottle, characterised in that the cap
comprises, at its lower part (2), a portion (8) projecting

laterally in relation to the main frame of the bottle and
having a downwardly open cutout (12) permitting support by

the hooking of the cap/bottle assembly onto a supporting
structural element.
Assembly according to claim 1, characterised in that
the cap has a carrying and handling handle (22).
Assembly according to claim 2, characterised in that
the handle (22) extends transversely, substantially

directly above the laterally projecting portion (8).
Assembly according to claim 3, characterised in that
the upper part (1) has two lateral ribs (23A, 23B)

connecting the handle (22) to the projecting portion (8).
Assembly according to one of claims 1 to 4,
characterised in that the projecting portion (8) has a

transverse outer profile with a large radius of curvature
permitting the laying-flat of the cap/bottle assembly on a

surface.
Assembly according to one of the preceding claims,
characterised in that at least the lower part is

constituted by an individual piece (2) joined to the upper
part (1).
Assembly according to one of the preceding claims,
characterised in that the upper part (1) has at least one

cutout (21, 26) providing access to the space (19). 
Assembly according to claim 7, characterised in that
it has a lateral cutout (21) providing access to unions

(6, 7) on the distributing valve structure.
Assembly according to one of the preceding claims,
characterised in that the cap is produced, at least

partially, from plastic material.
Assembly according to one of the preceding claims,
characterised in that the bottle (3) contains pressurised

oxygen.
