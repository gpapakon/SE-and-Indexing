<DESCRIPTION>
 CNS ACTIVE TETRAHYDROBENZOTHIENOPYRIDINESThis invention relates to compounds having pharmacological activity, to a process for their preparation, to compositions containing them and to their use in the treatment of mammals.EP-A-0 327 223 (Beecham Group pic) discloses a class of tetrahydrobenzothienopyridines which have anxiolytic and/or anti-depressant activity.WO 91/17165 (published 14 November 1991) describes a class of compounds of formula (A) or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof:wherein:Ri is hydrogen, C\.Q alkyl, phenyl or phenyl C1.4 alkyl wherein the phenyl moiety is optionally substituted by one or more C .Q alkyl, C^. alkoxy, C^.g alkylthio, hydroxy, C2-.7 alkanoyl, halo, trifluoromethyl, nitro, amino optionally substituted by one or two C^.g alkyl groups or by C-2-7 alkanoyl, cyano, carbamoyl or carboxy groups;R2 and R3 are independently selected from hydrogen, Cι_g alkyl, C^.Q alkyl, C3.7 cycloalkyl, C3.7 cycloalkyl-Cι.4 alkyl, C2-6 alkenyl, C^ alkanoyl, Cj.g alkylsulphonyl, di-(Cι_g alkyDamino Cj.g alkyl, 3-oxobutyl, 3-hydroxybutyl, phenyl, phenyl C1.4 alkyl, benzoyl, phenyl C2-7 alkanoyl or benzenesulphonyl any of which phenyl moieties are optionally substituted by one or two halogen, .Q alkyl, C^.g alkoxy, CF3, amino or carboxy, or R2 and R3 together are C2- polymethylene optionally interrupted by oxygen or NRg wherein Rg is hydrogen or C^.g 

 alkyl optionally substituted by hydroxy;R5 is hydrogen or Cj.g alkyl and RQ is hydrogen or R5 and R ~ g together form a Cj. alkylidene group at the 8-position; and-CO2 is a pharmaceutically acceptable ester group, which compounds are described as possessing CNS activity, in particular anxiolytic and/or antidepressant activity.WO 91/17165 also describes a class of intermediates which comprises compounds of formula (VID or a salt ester or amide thereof:wherein R4" is R wherein R41 is CO2R as defined in formula (A) or a group convertible to -CO2R4, Xis NR2'R3 » OH or chloro, R]_' is Ri as defined in formula (A) or a group convertible thereto, 2' and R3' are R2 and R3 as defined in formula (A) or N-protecting groups, J and K together represent a keto group or a group convertible thereto and R5 and Rg are as defined in formula (A), provided that when X is NR2 3, J and K together represent a keto group and R]_' is R^, R4" is other than CO2 4 including the methyl, ethyl, propyl, cyclopropylmethyl, prop-2-enyl, but-3- enyl, but-2-ynyl, but-3-ynyl and 2,2,2-trifluoroethyl esters of 4r-amino-7,7-
