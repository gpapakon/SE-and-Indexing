<ABSTRACT>
The blind riveted bolt according to the 
invention comprises a bolt (1) provided with a screw 

thread extending upto the head (2) thereof, and a sleeve 
(4) screwed onto this bolt (1) and comprising a collar 

(3) and a deformation cavity arranged for being deformed 
upon exerting a pulling force thereon in the longitudinal 

direction.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a blind 
riveted bolt. Blind riveted bolts are known and a clear 
example thereof is given in German Gebrauchsmuster 
7335070. Blind riveted bolts according to said Gebrauchsmuster 
consist of a threaded bolt having a 
cylindrical sleeve slid thereover and connected to the 
bolt by spot welding. The sleeve which slides over the 
bolt has no screw thread and is destined to be deformed 
by an axial pulling force exerted onto the bolt. The wall thickness of the sleeve is the 
same over its entire length. Producing a spot weld 
deforms and weakens the wall of the sleeve. These 
properties result in a weak connection between the bolt 
and the sleeve and this more particularly when the bolt 
is loaded axially. Due to the weak fixation and the shape of 
the sleeve (cylindrical) the fastener made therefrom has 
a small moment of torque. Another drawback of such blind riveted 
bolts is that they cannot or are at least very difficult 
to be rendered water or gas tight. Further, EP-A1-0406801 discloses a blind 
riveted bolt consisting of a pin and a sleeve forming a 
deformation cavity. Both of these components are 
connected by spot welding. This indicates that these components are 
made from steel which also implies that in most of the  
 
cases they have to be provided in an electrolytic bath 
with a protective layer. A blind riveted bolt assembled in this way 
offers different drawbacks. The spot weld connection is not only a 
relatively weak connection but such a spot welding 
operation produces an area between pin and sleeve which 
cannot be reached by the electrolytic solution. Further, 
due to the fact that the electrolytic solution 
cannot be circulated between pin and sleeve, too large 
areas cannot be protected by galvanization. Just because of the fact that the components 
are made from steel, the unprotected areas will 
rust considerably. Connections made by the use of such 
blind riveted bolts are not or at least insufficiently 
reliable, on the one hand, due to the weaker spot weld 
connections and, on the other hand, due to the inevitable 
rust formation as a result of the adverse situation 
set forth hereinabove. An object of the present invention is to 
develop a blind riveted bolt which does not show the 
hereinabove mentioned drawbacks and which allows, thanks 
to its concept, a prior complete electrolytic protection 
of its components. In order to achieve this object, the blind 
riveted bolt according to the invention comprises a bolt 
provided with a
