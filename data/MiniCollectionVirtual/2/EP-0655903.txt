<ABSTRACT>
A device is provided for facilitating oral administration of unit dosages of liquid formulations, particularly to pediatric and geriatric patients. Sealed cartridges (28) containing unit doses of liquid nutrients or medications can be locked into the device and at the same time, breached so that the contained-liquid formulation (30) can flow from the cartridge (28) into a hollow nipple (14) for facile oral consumption. The liquid formulation-containing sealed cartridge (28) includes a container (72) having a side wall collapsible responsive to withdrawal of liquid from the hollow nipple.

<DESCRIPTION>
 DEVICE FOR ORAL ADMINISTRATION OF LIQUIDSBackground and Summary of the InventionThis invention relates to a device for oral administration of liquid formulations. More particularly, the invention is directed to a pacifier¬ like device for dispensing a unit dose of a liquid nutrient or medication from a sealed cartridge into a hollow nipple for facile consumption by pediatric and geriatric patients.Many medicines and nutrients are formulated as liquids for oral administration. Parents, nurses, and physicians are often challenged by the task of administering such liquids to newbornε, infants, toddlers and even the elderly. The present invention was developed responsive to what has been perceived as the very significant need to facilitate oral drug delivery to these special patients.It is known to use a modified pacifier to deliver a liquid to an infant. For example, U.S. Patent No. 5,013,321 discloses a pacifier for delivery of a flavored gel to an infant through a nipple; U.S. Patents 2,889,829 and 4,867,159 disclose pacifiers that can be filled with syrups and liquified medicines, respectively; and U.S. Patents 2,824,561 and 3,426,755 disclose medicine feeders. Also, a dual-chambered container for delivery of a liquid medicament through a nipple is disclosed in U.S. Patent No. 4,959,051, and a pacifier accommodating a porous medication container is disclosed in U.S. Patent No. 2,612,165.Although liquid-dispensing pacifiers are known, many pacifiers are not well-suited for delivering unit doses of medicines or other liquid formulations. Measuring and administering the small volume (dose) of a liquid formulation presents a problem that often makes it 

difficult or inconvenient to use a pacifier-like delivery device for oral administration of medicines. A device configured to utilize a sealed cartridge containing a pre-measured volume of liquid medicine, nutrients, or the like would provide a significant improvement over known liquid-dispensing pacifiers. Not only would it simplify the task of dispensing orally administrable liquid formulations, but it would, as well, provide more accurate control of dosage levels. According to the present invention, a pacifier¬ like device is provided for dispensing liquid formulations orally to patients who might resist efforts to administer oral dosage forms by typical oral dosing techniques. The device includes a hollow nipple, a hollow handle formed to include a cartridge-receiving cavity, a base trapped between the nipple and the handle and arranged to cover the
