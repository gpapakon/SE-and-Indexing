<ABSTRACT>
A prosthesis including (a) a flexible ligament (1) with a first narrowed thinner portion (2) and a second wider portion (3) forming an extension of, and having a greater width and thickness (e2) than, said first portion, which portion may be passed around the spinous processes (12) of two adjacent vertebrae (L5, L4) in a figure of eight pattern, whereas the second portion circles around said processes; (b) a semi-flexible inter-process block (6) with two pairs of through-channels (7, 8) having differing cross-sections and receiving the respective portions of the ligament; and (c) members (4, 5) for joining the ends of the ligament. Said prosthesis prevents sagittal and frontal lumbar vertebral rotational instability.

<CLAIMS>
Intervertebral prosthesis comprising a flexible 
ligament (1) and an inter-spinal wedge (6) in which are 

drilled a pair of through-channels (7; 8), adapted for 
the ligament (1) to pass through, characterised in that 

said flexible ligament (1) comprises a first thin part 
(2) of limited width (l
1
) and limited thickness (e
1
), and 
a second wide part (3) as an extension of the first 

part, its width (l
2
) and thickness (e
2
) being greater 
than those of the first part, the first part being 

intended to allow it to be laced in a figure-of-eight 
around the spinous processes (12) of two adjacent 

vertebrae (L5, L4), whilst the second part is adapted to 
carry out peri-spinous looping, said inter-spinal wedge 

(6) being semi-flexible and drilled with a second pair 
of through-channels (8, 7) of different cross section 

from said first pair, the two pairs being adapted for 
the two respective parts of the ligament to pass 

through, and in that said prosthesis further comprises 
means (4, 5) for closing the ligament off on itself. 
Prosthesis according to claim 1, characterised in 
that the two channels (7) for the thin part (2) to pass 

through are juxtaposed in the central part of the wedge 
(6) and communicate with each other through a median 

opening (9) which allows two strands of the thin part 
(2) of the ligament to cross over, and the two channels 

(8) for the wide part (3) to pass through are arranged 
on each side of the through-openings for the thin part. 
Prosthesis according to one of claims 1 and 2, 
characterised in that the means for closing off the 

ligament (1) comprise filaments (4, 5) which extend the 
ends of its two parts, fixing being achieved by an "X" 

suture or by similar means such as metal rivets or 
clips.  

 
Prosthesis according to one of the preceding 
claims, characterised in that the wedge (6) is made of 

the same material as the ligament (1) and made semi-flexible 
by means of reinforcing seams (11), for 

example.
