<ABSTRACT>
A memory (15) for a digital display system (10) having a spatial light 
modulator (SLM) (16) that displays data in bit-plane format. The memory 

(15) has control means (25) for row random access. It also has a set of input 
registers (31) an
d two sets of output registers (32), (33). The input registers 
(31) receive pixel data before it has been processed. The memory (15) 

delivers this data back to a processor (14) for processing via a first set of 
output registers (32). After processing, the input registers (31) receive pixel 

data that has been fully processed and is ready for display. The second set of 
output registers (33), controlled at their input or output by a bit selector (37), 

delivers bit-planes of data to the SLM (16).

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to image display systems, and more particularly
to a digital memory for a display system that processes image data and uses
a spatial light modulator to display real-time images.Real-time display systems based on spatial light modulators (SLMs)
are increasingly being used as an alternative to display systems using
cathode ray tubes (CRTs). SLM systems provide high resolution displays
without requiring the digital data to be converted to analog form prior to
display as is the case with a CRT system.Deformable mirror devices (DMDs) are a type of SLM, and may be
used in projection display applications. A DMD has an array of micro-mechanical
mirror elements, each individually addressable by electronic
data. Depending on the state of its addressing signal, each mirror element is
moved so that it either does or does not reflect light to the image plane.
Other SLMs operate on similar principles, with pixel elements that emit or
reflect light simultaneously with other pixel elements, such that a complete
image frame is generated by addressing pixel elements rather than by
scanning them.For processing data in an SLM-based system, as is the case with other
digital image processing systems, the processor operates on pixel data.
Interlaced data is arranged pixel-by-pixel, row-by-row, and field-by-field.
Scan conversion techniques are applied to generate frames from fields. Non-interlaced
data is already arranged as frames. Processing tasks such as 
colorspace conversion and scaling, as well as scan conversion, are performed
on the pixel data.However, in an SLM-based system, prior to display, the data must be
arranged in "bit-planes". In other words, bit-level data must be delivered to
the SLM so that each pixel element can be "on" or "off' a length of time
corresponding to the value of its pixel data. A bit-plane represents all bits of
all pixels having the same digital weight. For pixels having an n-bit
resolution, there are n bit-planes per image frame.Because of these different data formats, existing SLM systems use
separate memories for providing pixel data to be processed and for providing
bit-plane data to the SLM. For accomplishing digital processing tasks, a first
memory supplies pixel data to a processor. A second memory delivers bit-plane
data to the SLM.According to one aspect of the present invention, there is provided a
memory for use in a digital display system having a processor for performing
image processing and having a spatial light modulator (SLM) for generating
an image
