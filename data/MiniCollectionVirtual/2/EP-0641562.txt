<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a method of stimulating the immune system of patients 
suffering from human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-related infection, by administering a 
nutritional supplement and to the use of a specific components in the manufacture of the 
nutritional supplement. HIV-infection is frequently accompanied by malnutrition (see Malnutrition and 
Immune Dysfunction in Patients Infected with HIV, by U. Süttmann et al. in Klin. 
Wochenschr. (1991) 69: 156-162). Although HIV-related malnutrition is regarded to be 
one of the earliest clinical signs of the disease, it is generally accepted that there is no 
direct correlation between immunological depression and the loss of body mass. As long as it is not possible to cure HIV-infected patients, it is important to slow 
down or reverse the development of adverse symptoms associated with HIV-infection 
whilst allowing the patients to continue as long as possible their normal daily life, 
including eating habits. From the nutritional point of view there is accordingly a need to 
develop a dietary supplement having immunostimulatory activity and that can be taken 
between meals. Thus there is a need for a dietary supplement that stimulates the immune 
system when administered in relatively low amounts, the immunostimulatory activity of 
the supplement not being impaired by previous or subsequent meals taken by the HIV-infected 
patient.  The present invention relates to the use of a compound associated with the 
synthesis of polyamines(which hereinafter will be referred to as component (a)); and an 
omega-3-polyunsaturated fatty acid (which hereinafter will be referred to as component 
(b)) in the manufacture of a nutritional supplement for treatment of patients suffering from 
Human Immunodeficiency Virus-related infection. The present invention further relates to the use of component (a); component (b) 
and a nucleobase source in the manufacture of a nutritional supplement for treatment of 
patients suffering from human immunodeficiency virus-related infection. In a further embodiment the present invention provides a method of stimulating the 
immune system in patients suffering from Human Immunodeficiency Virus-related 
infection which method comprises administering to the patient an aggregate 
immunostimulatory effective amount of component (a) and component (b). In a yet further embodiment the present invention provides a method of stimulating 
the immune system in patients suffering from Human Immunodeficiency Virus-related 
infection which
