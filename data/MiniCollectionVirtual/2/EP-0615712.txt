A spice container 3 has a neck 4 and a closure body 2 which is fitted onto the container neck or into which the container neck is fitted. The container neck, or a cap 5 mounted on the latter, is provided with an outer peripheral groove 9 into which an O-ring 10 is inserted. The closure body 2 has an inner peripheral groove 11 into which the O-ring 10 engages when the closure body is fitted on. As a result, a connection between the spice container and the closure body which is leaktight but disconnectable with little effort is provided.
