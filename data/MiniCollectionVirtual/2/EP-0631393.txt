<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a circuit arrangement for sampling randomly occurring signals, specifically those which have a steep rise and a gradual fall, in which the sampling AD conversion is carried out in accordance with the two-step method with coarse/fine-range architecture and interpolating residue coding. Use is made of two sampling AD converters, which have a low resolution and a high sampling frequency, a digital summer, an integrator and a DA converter. According to the invention, the sampled values of the AD converter are digitally integrated in the integrater, with the result that a digital reconstruction of the input signal is obtained at the output of the integrator. This reconstruction is converted back again into an analog signal by the DA converter and then subtracted from the input signal by means of the analog subtracter in order to form an analog residual-value signal (residue), which is in turn digitised by the AD converter with the same sampling frequency and then added via the summer to the integrator. A digital representation of the input signal is obtained in this way at the output of the integrator, which representation, in comparison with the internally used AD converters, has a higher resolution and an expanded dynamic range at the same sampling rate.

Circuit arrangement for scanning statistically
occurring signals, specifically those with a steep

build-up and a slow decay, of the type frequently
encountered in nuclear spectroscopy with semiconductor

detectors, having

a first input for an analogue input signal (9);

differential (residue) between the analogue

input signal (9) and the analogue intermediate
signal (10);

is an integrator (4) for the digital

integration of the total generated in the
totalising system (3) from the digitised

input signal and the digitised signal
differential, the digitised and integrated

output signal from the integrator (4)
