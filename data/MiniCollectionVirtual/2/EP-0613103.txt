<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a parking card for the chargeable actuation of a parking barrier, in the form of a sheet-like plastic piece (1) with a front and rear side having a machine-readable data carrier for the storage of multi-storey car-park and user characteristic data and, if appropriate, of the entry and exit time. In order to provide a parking card which is of simple design and can be handled easily and which allows the installation of an inexpensive parking processing system, provision is made for the plastic piece (1) to have the form of a round coin, on or in which is fitted a contactlessly working identification and/or communication component (5) which comprises a chip and a data-transmission device radiating electromagnetic waves.

<CLAIMS>
Method of registering parking times and/or parking fees using parking tickets made, in each case, of a flat plastics piece in the form of a round reusable coin which is equipped with a machine-readable data carrier for storing an individual identification, which method comprises the issue by an entry station of a parking ticket, which is read contact-free, to a parking customer on entry into a multistorey carpark or carparking area, the insertion of that parking ticket into a payment machine for the payment of due parking fees and then the insertion of that parking ticket into an exit station to request release and to open a parking barrier,
characterised in that
- before issue, each parking ticket has the entry time written onto it, independently of position, in the entry station, the parking ticket being in the form of a local data carrier for parking data, the data carrier being equipped with a chip and a data transmission device that emits electro-magnetic waves omni-directionally,
- after the individual identification has been read, the entry time has been read and the due parking fees have been paid, an exit time is written on the parking ticket in the payment machine,
- the parking data on the parking ticket are erased after the parking barrier has opened or are overwritten if the parking ticket is re-issued, and
- the parking ticket is transported, exploiting its rolling properties, to read/write stations for the parking data to be read/written.
