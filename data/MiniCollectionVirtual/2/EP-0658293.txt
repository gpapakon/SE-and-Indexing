<ABSTRACT>
The invention provides a means of reducing crosstalk in data connectors and includes a first conductive signal path and a second conductive signal path. The first signal path includes crossover connection means for changing over the position of the first signal path at a point intermediate between the ends of the first and second paths to reduce crosstalk in the first and second paths through the introduction of antiphase signals. In practice this antiphase crosstalk can be applied by a network of PCB tracks (36) to simulate the conductors.

<DESCRIPTION>
METHOD AND APPARATUS FOR CROSSTALK CANCELLATION IN DATA CONNECTORSThe present application relates to a method and apparatus for cross talk cancellation and is particularly applicable to cancellation of cross talk in communications systems for data transmission.In a typical data communication system, data and voice signals are passed along unshielded twisted pair (UTP) cables. In a typical cable system a plurality of twisted pairs are enclosed in a single cable. Such cables have, however, to be interconnected with, for example, peripheral equipment such as digital telephones, facsimile machines, etc. by means of plugs and jacks.Thus the speed at which data is being passed along UTP cables is increasing all the time. It is therefore important that the connecting hardware (plugs and jacks) have at least equal transmission performance to that of theUTP otherwise the performance characteristic of any overall system may be compromised.It is therefore an object of the present invention to provide a method and apparatus for reducing cross talk in communication systems.It is a further object to provide a jack socket incorporating apparatus for reducing cross talk on communication systems.The present invention therefore provides a method of reducing cross talk in data communication systems in which an electrical signal is coupled onto a first signal path including generating an antiphase electrical signal in a second signal path and adding the antiphase signal to the electrical signal in the first signal path to cancel cross talk present on the first signal path. 

 The present invention also provides apparatus for reducing cross talk in data communication systems including a first conductive signal path and a second conductive signal path said first signal path including cross over connection means for changing over the position of the conductor of the first signal path at a point intermediate between the ends of the first and second conductive signal paths to reduce cross talk in the first and second conductive signal paths.Embodiments of the present invention will now be described, by way of example, with reference to the accompanying drawings in which:-Figure 1 shows diagrammatically in side elevational cross section an eight way connecting system comprising a plug and jack socket illustrative of an embodiment of the present invention; Figure 2 shows the plug and socket of Figure 1 in schematic rear elevation;Figure 3 shows the plug and socket of Figure 1 in schematic front elevation;Figure 4 shows the
