<ABSTRACT>
A plunger operated switch 2 has a pair of movable contacts 18 on a 
movable contact carrier 16 bridged by a secondary contact 20 supported on a 

pushbutton operator member 10 which is biased apart from the contact carrier 
16. Depression of the pushbutton operator 10 for the plunger assembly 8 moves 

the primary movable contacts 18 into bridging engagement with the stationary 
contacts 14, 15 through the secondary contact member 20. In the event the 

primary movable contacts 16 weld to the stationary contacts 14, 15 and an 
operating force F is removed from the plunger operator 10, a spring 22 biases 

the secondary contact 20 away from the primary movable contacts 18 to open 
the bridging relationship therebetween and open the circuit controlled by the 

switch. A pair of normally closed contacts 14c, 28 are arranged for operation by 
the pushbutton operator 10 so that the contacts 14c, 28 open before the main 

contacts 14, 15, 18 close and close after the main contacts open rendering them 
particularly suitable for use as dynamic braking contacts in a motor control 

application. Insulating means 24 are provided between the primary movable 
contacts 18 and the secondary bridging contact 20 to prevent reclosure thereof 

once the secondary contact 20 is separated from the primary movable contacts 
18.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to electric switches and in particular to
electric switches which operate a secondary set of contacts in response to a
welded condition of a primary set of contacts. Still more particularly, the
invention relates to switches of the aforementioned type which are pushbutton
operated, and to such switches which have an additional set of contacts
particularly adapted for completing a dynamic braking circuit to a load controlled
by the switch.A welded contact in a switch maintains a current path through the
switch after the switch has been operated to an off condition. This condition can
be surprising to the user of apparatus controlled by the switch, and could be
dangerous. If, for example, the switch controls a motor of an electric driven
vehicle, a welded contact could cause the vehicle to continue to be propelled
after the switch is operated to an off condition in expectation of stopping the
vehicle.U.S. patent 4,647,727 issued March 3, 1987 to C. G. Sontheimer
discloses a switch as defined in the preamble of claims 1 and 14, respectively, and having normally closed auxiliary contacts operable to an open
condition upon a welded condition of main switch contacts. The auxiliary
contacts represent a separate complete switch within the switch housing having
its own actuator and being operated by a specific condition of the linkage and
operator of the main switch. The auxiliary switch also has its own terminals
separate from the main contact terminals and therefore only provides safety in
the system being controlled if the contacts are appropriately connected into the
system.U.S. patent 4,216,358 issued August 5, 1980 to J. Brozille discloses
a pushbutton snap switch wherein a pair of movable contacts oscillate between
spaced pairs of stationary contacts by a snap action over-center mechanism. In
the event the contacts remain welded upon depression of the pushbutton to drive 
the actuating mechanism over-center, continued depression of the pushbutton
physically rotates the stationary contacts to break the circuit at a different
location on the stationary contact. This weld-responsive action occurs on
depression of the pushbutton which is normally associated with actuation of the
switch, not release thereof. Release of the pushbutton permits the faulty contacts
to be reclosed and the circuit to be re-energized.As defined in claim 1, this invention provides an electric switch having primary movable
contacts engageable and disengageable with respective stationary contacts in
response to
