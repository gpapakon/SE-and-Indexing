<ABSTRACT>
Compositions of bacteriorhodopsin variants with increased memory time and their use for reversible optical information recording are disclosed. The compositions are characterized in that the configuration of the retinal of the photoproduct is different from the configuration of the retinal of the initial state and other than 13-cis; the pH value of the composition lies between 3 and 11; the water content of the composition lies between 1 and 30 % by weight with respect to the total weight of the composition; and additives for modulating the proton mobility are present in a concentration between 1 and 80 % by weight of the mass of purple membrane composition used, and if required matrix materials in a concentration of up to 10 % by weight with respect to the total weight of the composition are present. These compositions may be used in reversible information recording systems.

<CLAIMS>
A preparation containing at least one purple
membrane variant in which more than 50 % of a

bacteriorhodopsin variant is converted at room
temperature into a photoproduct having an

absorption maximum which is shifted spectrally by
at least 10 nm compared with the initial state by

irradiation with light having a wavelength in the
region of the absorption band of the initial state

where the configuration of the retinal of the
photoproduct is changed compared with the

configuration of the retinal of the initial state
and is different from 13-cis, or the Schiff base

bond of the retinal is hydrolyzed and the
photoproduct can be converted back into the initial

state by irradiation with light having a wavelength
in the region of its absorption band,


wherein the pH of the preparation is between 4 and
6 and the water content of the preparation is

between 1 and 30 % by weight relative to the total
weight of the preparation,
and auxiliary substances for modulation of the
proton mobility are present at a concentration of

between 1 and 80 % by weight relative to the amount
of purple membrane preparation used and optionally

matrix materials are present at a concentration of
up to 10 % by weight rel
ative to the total weight
of the preparation.
Preparation as claimed in claim 1, wherein the
configuration of the retinal chromophore of the

photoproduct is 9-cis. 
Preparation as claimed in one of the claims 1 and
2, wherein it contains BR
D85,96N
 as the
bacteriorhodopsin variant.
Preparation as claimed in one or several of the
claims 1 to 3, wherein one or several substances

from the group comprising glycerol, guanidine,
arginine, urea, diethylamine, azides, cyanates,

glycols, mono-, di- and polysaccharides and mono-
or polyfunctional alcohols are used as auxiliary

substances to modulate proton mobility.
Preparation as claimed in one or several of the
claims 1 to 4, wherein polyacrylamide, gelatin,

agarose, agar, polyvinylpyrrolidone, polyvinyl
alcohol, polyvinyl acetate, polyhydroxymethyl

acrylate and mixtures thereof are used as matrix
materials.
Preparation as claimed in one or several of the
claims 1 to 5, wherein the absorption maxima of the

initial state and of the photoproduct are in the
emission range of solid or semiconductor lasers.
Use of a preparation as claimed in one or several
of the claims 1 to 6 for reversible optical

information recording.
Use of a preparation as claimed in one or several
of the claims 1 to 6 in a process which enables

non-destructive reading of information. 
Use of a preparation as claimed in one or several
of the claims 1 to 6 in holography or in pattern

recognition or in optical neural networks and/or
associative memories.
Use of a preparation as claimed in one or several
of the claims 1 to 6 as reconfigurable absorbers,

optical elements or reconfigurable phase
modulators.
Use of a preparation as claimed in one or several
of the claims 1 to 6 in combination with a

transient storage medium.
Use of a preparation as claimed in one or several
of the claims 1 to 6 in mixtures with other purple

membrane variants.
Means for storing information containing a
preparation as claimed in one or several of the

claims 1 to 6.
A process for the storage and non-destructive
reading of information in a preparation as claimed

in one or several of the claims 1 to 6, wherein
information is stored by irradiating the

preparation with linearly-polarized light having a
wavelength in the region of the absorption maximum

of the initial state of the bacteriorhodopsin
variant present in the preparation, and detecting

the information stored in this way by determining
the change in the polarization state of a linearly-polarized

photochemically inactive detection beam
after it has passed through the preparation, where 

the detection beam is polarized neither
perpendicular nor parallel to the polarization

direction of the recording light.
