<ABSTRACT>
The modular system according to the present invention allows to modify the colour and the external finishing of wedding rings or generally rings and other articles of jewellery and cheap jewelry, by the covering of a central module (1) with a plurality of superposed blades (2, 3) and/or with the subsequent addition, by means of connecting systems like pressure connection, release insertion, screwing, joint connection, of a plurality of modelled and coloured annular structures (36). The industrial process for the realization of the modular system provides the shaping of tubular structures (63-64-65) with a plurality of coaxial layers, of different metals, with subsequent cutting and finishing, or the succession of electroplating deposits or subsequent casting.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention concerns a modular system for
the realization of jewellery or cheap jewelry articles
like (wedding) rings, bracelets and other articles
that may be changed in colour and in their external
finish, with modular elements and/or with superposing
layers. Such a modular form of jewellery is known for
example from US-A-1,327,606.It is well known that families are in the habit of
remembering the most important wedding anniversaries
by means of signs that underline the years passed
together and renew the marriage covenant for the
future. In particular, there is the custom of
celebrating silver and gold wedding with the exchange
of new rings, of gold or white gold, that replace the
old wedding rings or are added to them.This habit is for sure full of significance for the
couple and therefore the expense for the new rings
after such long periods - 25 or 50 years - is usually
accepted.However, there are some people who believe that new
rings of a different colour may reduce the symbolic 
value of the wedding ring, that would loose its
character of unicity and authenticity.Furthermore, jewels in general - even if less than
rings and other worn articles - are subject to
fashion. Until now, it has been usually possible to
modify a jewellery article, e.g. a ring, when it it
did no longer meet with the taste of the person who
wore it, only selling it and buying a new, different
article, or by smelting the metal, recovering the
eventual gems and realizing a new jewel.In both cases, the value of the article is usually
valued on the percentage of the precious metal and on
the carats of the gems, while for more complete
valuation also the working cost of the jewel should be
considered. However, this cost can not be recovered,
especially in case of smelting. Furthermore, a ring or
any other jewel usually has a great loving value that
gets completely lost with its selling or smelting.The aim of the present invention therefore is the one
of responding to the following needs:
to allow that the wedding ring may be adapted to the
passing of the years, substantially maintaining the
same features of the ring exchanged on the wedding
day; to avoid the cost for buying new rings, because of
the customs or because of pure aesthetical choices;to realize jewellery articles provided with modular
elements that may be composed according to the taste
of the customer;to provide jewellery articles that may be modified
without being subject to irreversible changes, with
the average ability of anyone, making use of

<CLAIMS>
A modular ring,
bracelet or other jewellery article

for symbolizing important events in the
life of an individual,


comprising an inner ring (1,2,3),

which symbolizes a first important event,
an intermediate ring (1b,2b,3b),

which symbolizes a second important event,

completely enclosing at least the outer peripheral surface
of said inner

ring and being retained thereupon,
an outer ring (1c,2c,3c),

which symbolizes a third important event,

completely enclosing at least the outer peripheral surface
of both inner and intermediate rings and being retained on said

intermediate ring,

with said inner, intermediate and outer rings being
different from one another.
A modular ring,
bracelet or other jewellery article

according to claim 1, wherein said intermediate
ring is formed of two interconnectable hollow

half-rings and where said outer ring is formed of two
interconnectable hollow half-rings, whereby each respective

pair of half-rings when connected, form a complete
circle.
A modular ring,
bracelet or other jewellery article

according to claims 1 or 2, wherein said
