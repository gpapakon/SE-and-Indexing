<ABSTRACT>
A belt weatherstrip (10) adapted to engage an end flange (12) of a 
vehicle for operative sealing between a glass window (14) and a 

vehicle surface (16). The flange (12) of the vehicle has an inner 
surface (24) and an outer surface (26). The belt weatherstrip (10) is 

expandable to accommodate adaptability to various vehicle 
surface contours by allowing expandability of the width of the 

weatherstrip. 
The belt weatherstrip (10) includes an elongated core 
substrate (34) which has an inner flange portion (36) for abutting the 

inner surface (24) of the flange (12) and includes an outer flange 
portion (38) and intermediate portion connecting the inner flange 

portion with the outer flange portion and a plurality of clips (42) 
for securing the elongated core substrate to the end flange. 

An elastomeric sealing lip member (52) is attached to the flange 
portion for allowing slideable sealing engagement between the 

flange and a glass pane (14). The intermediate portion (40) includes a 
bend therein in its normal position wherein the bend may be 

selectively straightened to expand the width of the 
weatherstrip for accommodating varying final applications in a 

vehicle. 
A glass run weatherstrip having a bend (312) in its 
intermediate leg is also provided for traversing corners of a 

door window aperture.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a belt weatherstrip and
a glass run weatherstrip for a vehicle. More particularly,
the present invention relates to a belt weatherstrip or the
like which seals the portion of a vehicle between the sliding
glass window and the show surface of a vehicle door, for
instance.Belt weatherstrips of the past have generally been
utilized to weather-strip sheet metal flange areas of a
vehicle, such as found in a vehicle door, for instance, which
has a spot welded end flange connecting the outer show surface
portion with the inner frame portion of the door. Such
weatherstrips commonly include a sealing lip for sealing and
stripping water off the glass window and an overhanging
elastomeric strip portion which engages the outer show surface
of the car door in order to prevent water from entering the
flange area.It is desired in such constructions to provide a strip
show surface of the weatherstrip which may include either a
colored elastomer strip or chrome strip or the like which
aesthetically matches the finishing contours of the vehicle 
surface, in order to produce a matched fit. In many vehicle
designs a transition edge is formed near the flange which
becomes a transition point from the weatherstrip show surface
to the vehicle door show surface. Such edges generally are
not parallel to the flange portion but have certain contours
or may taper depending on the design of the vehicle body and
doors. Thus, in the past it was necessary to provide separate
constructions which would exactly match the particular
application depending on the width of the necessary overlying
surface.It is desired that such a belt weatherstrip will blend in
with the design of the vehicle body and form a generally
continuous surface at the transition edge into the vehicle
door or the like. This was accomplished, in past
constructions, by manufacturing a belt weatherstrip in
accordance with the particular tolerances of the particular
application. For instance, in prior constructions a belt
weatherstrip core and show surface were manufactured to a
particular specification. After the manufacture of this
portion a separately manufactured glass sealing lip member was
attached by staples or the like to the first portion and the
belt weatherstrip was then assembled onto the vehicle end
flange.Thus, these prior belt weatherstrips were relatively
expensive to manufacture since the tooling and manufacturing
equipment used must be changed for each particular vehicle
model design. Additionally, such prior belt

A weatherstrip (10) adapted to engage an end flange (12) of a
vehicle for sealing between a glass window (14) and a vehicle

surface (16), said flange (12) having an inner surface (24) and an outer
surface (26), said weatherstip (10) being expandable in its width to

accommodate adaptability to various contours and dimensions of
said vehicle surface, said weatherstrip (10) comprising:


an elongated core substrate (34) including a first flange
portion (36) for placement adjacent said end flange (12),

second flange portion (38) and an intermediate portion (40) connecting said
second flange portion (38) with said first flange portion (36);
a means (43) for securing said elongated core substrate to
said end flange (12); and
a sealing lip member (52) integral with one of said first and
second flange

portions (36,38) allowing sealing engagement between the one of said
first and second flange

portions (36,38) and a window panel (14), said intermediate portion (40)
including a bend

formed therein said bend providing for adjustment of the
width of said weatherstrip (10) to accommodate varying final

applications in a vehicle.
The weatherstrip of Claim 1 wherein said first
flange (36) and second flange (38) define a channel therebetween and

said intermediate portion (40) is arcuately formed into the channel
along its length. 
The weatherstrip of claim 1 or 2 wherein the
weatherstrip (10) is a belt weatherstrip adapted for

sealing between a glass window (14) and a vehicle show
surface (22), wherein the inner surface (24) of the end

flange (12) faces toward a glass channel of the vehicle
and the outer surface (26) of the end flange (12) is

adjacent a show surface (22) of a vehicle, wherein the
second flange portion (38) of the elongated core
