Process for the production of a sleeve-shaped
printing forme, in particular for offset printing, of a

metallic material for a forme cylinder of a printing
machine, proceeding from a plate-shaped blank which is

clamped true-to-register into a welding device, where
the opposite plate edges forming the beginning and end

of the printing forme are welded by means of a laser
beam, so that a printing forme sleeve with a continuous

circumferential surface is produced,
characterised in that

the plate-shaped blank (1) having a width corresponding
to the forme cylinder is cut roughly to length with a

dimension greater than that specified for a printing
forme by stamping from a metallic workpiece, in that

the blank (1) is inserted into the welding device,
without overlapping, in the true-to-register, rounded

state, as a work piece that is stamped but not cut to
the correct length, is cut to the correct length in the

welding device by means of the laser beam acting as a
cutting device (6a, 6b) so that at least one piece of

waste (7a, 7b) is produced, in that the piece of waste
(7a, 7b) is removed, the two plate edges (8a, 8b)

forming the beginning and the end of the printing forme
are set opposite each other without overlapping and are

welded together.
Process for the production of a sleeve-shaped
printing forme according to claim 1, characterised in

that the blank (1) in the true-to-register, rounded
state is cut to the correct length at both opposite

plate edges (5a, 5b) by means of the laser beam (6a,
6b) so that two pieces of waste (7a, 7b) are produced

which are both removed. 
Process for the production of a sleeve-shaped
printing forme according to one of the preceding

claims, characterised in that the plate-shaped blank
(1) is, together with a register device in the form of

a fitting hole system in the region of the plate edges
(5a, 5b) forming the beginning and end of the blank

(1), produced by stamping outside the printing area.
Process for the production of a sleeve-shaped
printing forme according to claim 3, characterised in

that the register device is introduced into the region
of the blank (1) that is removed after the laser

cutting as a waste piece (7a, 7b).
