<DESCRIPTION>
 METHOD OF FORMING A GASKETThis invention relates to a method of forming gaskets, more particularly a method of forming a gasket by injection of a curable composition into a gasket space, and to a mechanical assembly comprising a gasket between two components of said assembly.It has been proposed to provide a gasket composition which can be injected between two components, for example in an engine or other machine, and which will then polymerise in situ. For example, the two components can be assembled face-to-face, and a polymerisable gasket composition injected under pressure into a gap or groove in one of the faces, so that the composition flows along the gap or groove until it is distributed throughout the gap or groove, and forms a sealing path around the area of the mating surfaces.The composition is then cured in situ to form the gasket.An example of such a prior art method is described in US-A-5116558 which discloses a method of forming a gasket in situ between two components which includes injecting into a groove in at least one of the said 

 components a curable composition including one or more free-radical polymerisable vinyl esters, and ingredients of a rapid free-radical cure system therefor, the cure system being inactivated prior to injection of the 5 composition, and the composition having a viscosity at 25°C m the range from 200 to 500,000 Pas, and permitting the composition to cure. Preferred compositions have a Brookfield viscosity at the time of the injection from about 2,000 to about 15,000 mPas at 10 25°C and gel to a non-flowable state within five minutes of the initiation of cure and had the consistency of a flexible solid upon full cure.US-A-5116558 provides full details of usable 15 polymerisable vinyl esters and free radical cure systems for use m the method to which the reader is referred for further information.Preferred compositions m accordance with US-A- 20 5116558 also incorporate ingredients for expanding the volume of the composition m situ at room temperature, preferably two reactive ingredients which react at room temperature to produce a gas m situ m the composition, the two reactive ingredients being isolated from each 25 other prior to injection of the composition. The object 

of the incorporation of ingredients for expanding the volume of the composition is stated to be to compensate for shrinkage which might occur upon polymerisation.The entire disclosure of US-A-5116558 is incorporated herein by reference for all purposes.Certain problems have been found to
