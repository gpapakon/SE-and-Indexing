<ABSTRACT>
Apparatus and method for assembling a piston ring in 
a circumferential groove of a piston wherein a plurality 

of ring nest members are disposed about a common axis 
for radial movement toward or away from the axis between 

radially contracted positions and radially expanded 
positions. The nest members collectively form a circular 

opening concentric with the axis and a ring-receiving 
recess concentric about the opening when they are in the 

contracted positions. The recess locates a radially 
unexpanded ring concentric with the axis and has a fixed 

axial dimension for preventing "oil canning" of the ring 
when it is expanded. The ring nest members are movable 

from the radially contracted to the expanded positions 
when the ring is expanded so as to collectively enlarge 

the opening for receiving the piston and the recess to 
maintain the expanded ring substantially concentric with 

the axis while the fixed axial dimension prevents "oil 
canning". A plurality of radially and axially movable 

ring expanding fingers are disposed about the axis and 
positionable in the opening for radially expanding the 

ring while it resides in the recess. Expansion of the 
ring effects movement of t
he ring nest members radially 
outward to the expanded positions to collectively 

enlarge the opening. The piston is moved into the 
enlarged opening along the axis in a manner that the 

ring expander fingers are moved axially out of 
engagement with the expanded ring in the enlarged recess 

while the piston groove is moved to receive the expanded 
ring from the recess.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to piston-ringing 
apparatus for high volume assembly of rail rings or 
other rings in circumferential grooves of pistons for 
internal combustion engines. Internal combustion engine pistons typically have 
several rings positioned in respective circumferential 
grooves proximate the closed (domed) end of the piston. 
For example, a typical internal combustion engine piston 
will include an inner expander ring with so-called rail 
rings on opposite sides thereof in the same groove, an 
intermediate cast iron compression ring, and outer cast 
iron or steel compression ring proximate the closed 
(domed) end of the piston. The compression rings typically are made of cast 
iron or steel and precision ground so as to be nearly 
perfectly flat and thus resistant (stiff) to bending out 
of a flat profile. Compression rings can be from 3 mm 
to 1 mm in thickness and have square or radiused inner 
diameters. Expander rings, on the other hand, typically are 
made of stainless steel and include vertical and/or 
horizontal corrugations. Expander rings are relatively  
 
flimsy and easily bendable out of a flat profile as 
compared to compression rings during the assembly operation 
into the respective piston grooves. Expander rings 
can be from 5 mm to 2 mm in thickness. Each corrugated expander ring typically is bounded 
or supported on each side in the same piston groove by 
what are called rail rings which are much thinner, 
spring steel rings. For example, the rail rings can 
typically have a thickness of 0.3 mm to 0.8 mm. The rail 
rings are adapted to wipe the cylinder wall of the 
internal combustion engine in a manner to provide a 
controllable thin oil lubricating layer thereon. As a 
result of their thinness and spring steel properties, 
the rail rings are prone to "oil-can" when radially 
expanded during assembly into the piston groove on 
opposite sides of the expander ring. "Oil canning" is a 
bowing of the thin rings into a two cycle wave 
(sinusoidal wave) type configuration when radially 
expanded during the ring-piston groove assembly 
operation. This "oil canning" makes assembly of the thin rail 
rings onto the piston groove difficult and unreliable. There is a need for piston ringing apparatus that 
can be used to assemble thin rail and similar rings onto 
internal combustion engine pistons at one or more piston 
ringing stations under high volume production conditions 
in a manner to avoid "oil canning" of the rings such 
that the rate and reliability of ring
