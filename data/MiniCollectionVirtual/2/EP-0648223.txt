<ABSTRACT>
Compounds and methods of making them having formula (I) are described which bind to selectin receptors and thus modulate the course of inflammation, cancer and related diseases by modulating cell-cell adhesion events. In formula (I), R1 is independently H or lower alkyl(1-4C); R2 is H, OH or lower alkyl(1-4C), alkylaryl or one or more additional saccharide residues; R3 is a negatively charged moiety including SO4--, PO4--, or related group; Y is H or lower alkyl(1-4C); and X is -CHR4(CHOR1)2CHR5OR1 wherein R4 and R5 are each independently H, lower alkyl(1-4C), or taken together result in a five- or six-membered ring optionally containing a heteroatom selected from the group consisting of O, S, and NR1; said five- or six-membered ring optionally substituted with one substituent selected from the group consisting of R1, CH2OR1, OR1, OOCR1, NR12, NHCOR1, and SR1 with the proviso that if X represents a hexose substituent R3 and R4, taken together, cannot provide a hexose substituent.

<DESCRIPTION>
 SUBSTITUTED LACTOSE DERIVATIVES AS CELL ADHESION INHIBITORSTechnical FieldThe invention relates to compounds useful in the treatment of inflammation, allergic reactions, autoimmune diseases, and related conditions. More specifically, the invention concerns substituted lactose that binds to selectin receptors and to pharmaceutical compositions containing them. The present invention is also directed to synthetic methods useful in obtaining these analogs and other lactose derivatives.Background ArtIt is now well established that cellular interactions are at least in part mediated by receptor/ligand interactions. One class of receptors is known to recognize the peptide sequence "RGD"; other receptors recognize carbohydrate ligands.One class of receptors that recognize carbohydrate-based ligands mediates the adhesion of circulating neutrophils to stimulated vascular endothelium. This is a primary event of the inflammatory response and appears to be involved as well in allergic and autoimmune responses. Several receptors have been implicated in this interaction, including a family of putative lectins that includes gp90MEL (Leu8), ELAM-1, and GMP-140 (PADGEM) and (Gong, J.-G., et al., Nature (1990) 343:757; Johnston, G.I., et al., Cell (1989) 56:1033; Geoffrey, J.S., and Rosen, S.D., J. Cell Biol. (1989) 109:2463; Lasky, L.A., et al., Cell (1989) 56:1045).These lectins have been termed L-SELECTIN, E-SELECTIN, and P-SELECTIN. E-SELECTIN is perhaps the best characterized of the three selectins. It is particularly interesting because of its transient expression on endothelial cells in response to IL-1 or TNF (Bevilacqua, M.P., et al., Science (1989) 243:1160). The time course of this induced expression (2-8 hours) suggests a role for this receptor in initial neutrophil extravasation in response to infection and injury. Furthermore, Bevilacqua et al. (see Bevilacqua, M.P., et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA (1987) 

84:923 ς) have demonstrated that human neutrophils or HL-60 cells will adhere to COS » transfected with a plasmid containing a CDNA encoding for the E-SEL . _TIN receptor. Information regarding the DNA sequences encoding for endothelial cell-leukocyte adhesion molecules are disclosed within PCT published application WO90/13300 published November 15, 1990.Recently, several different groups have published papers regarding the ligand for E-SELECTIN. Lowe et al., (1990) Cell, 63:475-484 reported a positive correlation between the E-SELECTIN dependent adhesion of HL-60 cell variants and transfected cell
