<ABSTRACT>
A dispenser for dispensing a dosage or a powdery or fluid drug from a cartridge having a tubular chamber (13) the ends of which are sealed by breakable membranes (5, 7). The dispenser comprises a housing (1) forming a cylinder which is at one end closed by an end wall through which an outlet pipe (3) communicates with the interior of the cylinder. The other end of the cylinder is closed by a plunger (9) which may be displaced into the cylinder. The drug cartridge is placed in a piston (8) mounted axially displaceable in the cylinder between the end wall and the plunger (9), and the tubular chamber (13) extends from one side of the piston (8) to the other. Penetrators (4, 10) for breaking the membranes (5, 7) are provided at the inner end of the outlet pipe (3) and at the inner end of the plunger (9).

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention concerns a disposable dispenser for drugs, and more 
specifically a dispenser for dispensing a dosage of a powdery or fluid drug stored 
in a cartridge having a tubular chamber, the ends of which are sealed by breakable 
membranes. Such dispensers may be used for dispensing powdery medicine which 
can be absorbed through the nasal mucous membranes and which is only given 
occasionally, e.g. emergency administration of glucagon for treating hypoglycaemic 
diabetics. Therefore, the dispenser should be suited for storing an appropriate 
dosage of a drug and should be easily operated to administer this dosage as a 
cloud of particles or droplets even by unprofessionals when necessary. US 2,672,144 discloses a disposable powder dispenser having the 
powdery drug stored in a bottle shaped vessel also containing a charge of 
compressed gas and sealed at the end of the bottle neck with a sealing which may 
be broken by a penetrator when the vessel is pressed into the dispenser unit. By 
using this dispenser care must be taken to ensure that the powder is passed up into 
the bottle neck - a precaution which cannot be expected to be taken by 
unprofessionals in an emergency situation. Further, the compressed gas may leak 
during storage, and consequently the dispenser may be unusable when the 
emergency situation occurs. EP 407 276 discloses a dispenser having powder stored in a tubular 
chamber being closed at its air inlet end by a membrane and at its outlet end by a 
removable lid. Immediately before use the lid is removed before the outlet end is 
inserted in a nostril. However, unless the powder appears as a lump wedging in the 
outlet, there will be a risk of spilling some of the powder, if the outlet should be 
inserted in the nostril of a person lying down. For the same reason, this dispenser 
is not usable for fluid drugs. A dispenser wherein powder is stored in a tubular chamber, the ends 
of which are closed by penetrable membranes, is known from WO 91/06333 forming the basis 
for the preamble of claim 1. In this 
dispenser a number of chambers are successively brought into alignment with an  
 
air supply pipe and an outlet pipe, and the membranes closing the chamber are 
penetrated by penetrators at the ends of these pipes. However, according to the 
construction of the apparatus the membrane at the air supply end is first broken, 
and thereafter the membrane at the outlet is penetrated. However, the penetrations are requested to take place in the opposite 
order to ensure that the

<CLAIMS>
A dispenser for dispensing a dosage of a powdery or fluid drug 
stored in a cartridge having a tubular chamber (13) the ends of which are sealed by 

breakable membranes, this dispenser comprising a housing (1) forming a cylinder which 
at one end is closed by an end wall through which an outlet pipe (3) communicates with 

the interior of the cylinder, the other end of the cylinder being closed by a plunger (9) 
having means to displace it axially into the cylinder towards the end wall, the 

dispenser being characterized in that the drug cartridge is placed in a piston (8) 
mounted axially displaceab
ly in the cylinder between the end wall and the plunger (9), 
the tubular chamber (13) of the cartridge extending in the axial direction of the cylinder 

from one side of the piston (8) to the other, and means (4, 10) for breaking the sealing 
membranes (5, 7) of the cartridge being provided at least at the inner end of the outlet 

pipe. 
A dispenser according to claim 1, 
characterized
 in, that the 
membrane breaking means is provided as a cutting protrusion (4) at the mouth of the 

outlet pipe (3) inside the cylinder. 
A dispenser according to claim 2, 
characterized
 in, that the 
protrusion (4) has a diameter smaller than the diameter of the bore of the tubular 

chamber (13), and is longer than the length of this chamber (13). 
A dispenser according to claim 1 or 2, 
characterized
 in, that a cutting 
member (10) is provided at the inner side of the plunger (9), this cutting member being 

aligned with the facing membrane (7).
