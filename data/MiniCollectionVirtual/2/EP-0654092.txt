<DESCRIPTION>
Mutations of proto-oncogenes in somatic cells are 
increasingly being recognized as significant in the 
induction of human cancers. Some examples of oncogenes 
formed by such mutations include: neu, fes, fos, myc, myb, 
fms, Ha-ras, and Ki-ras. The mutations that convert proto-oncogenes 
to oncogenes are often point mutations. Much 
needs to be learned in order to understand how oncogenes and 
their expression products function to transform normal cells 
to cancer cells. Oncogenes are generally believed to act in a dominant 
fashion. This is generally considered to mean that the 
conversion of a proto-oncogene to an oncogene results in the 
acquisition of a new function, i.e., enhancing 
transformation. A different type of mutation associated with cancer 
occurs when a tumor suppressor gene is altered in a way that 
causes the product of the gene to lose its tumor suppressor 
function. An example of such a tumor suppressor gene is the  
 
retinoblastoma susceptibility gene, Rb. Tumor suppressor 
genes are sometimes called recessive oncogenes, although, 
strictly speaking, the products of tumor suppressor genes do 
not contribute to tumor formation. The phenotype is 
recessive since, when both alleles are mutated, the absence 
of a tumor suppressor gene results in an enhancement of 
tumorigenesis. A gene product that exhibits some properties of both a 
dominant and a recessive oncogene is the 53kd 
phosphoprotein, p53. Evidence is growing that mutations in 
the p53 gene is associated with a large number of many types 
of cancers. For example, Iggo et al., Lancet 335, 675-679 
(1990) has expressed the opinion that p53 is the most common 
proto-oncogene to undergo mutation in lung cancers. Much of what is known about p53 has been derived from 
studying the effect of transfecting wild-type and mutant 
murine p53 in rat embryo fibroblast cells. This work has 
been reviewed by Levine et al., "The P53 Proto-Oncogene And 
Its Product," in Common Mechanisms Of Transformation By 
Small DNA Tumor Viruses, L. Villarreal, ed., American 
Society for Microbiology, Chapter 2 (1989); Hinds et al., 
ibid, Chapter 7; and Levine, BioEssays 12, 60-66 (1990). The p53 gene appears to be involved in transcriptional 
control (Fields, S. & Jang, S. K. (1990) Science249, 
1046-1049; Raycroft, L., Wu, H. & Lozano, G. (1990) Science249, 1049-1051; and Levine, A. J., Momand, J. & Finlay, C. 
A. (1991) Nature 351, 453-456) and may act as a regulatory 
check point in the cell cycle, arresting cells in the G-1 
phase (Martinez, J.,
