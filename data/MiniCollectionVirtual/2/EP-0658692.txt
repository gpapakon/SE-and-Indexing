<ABSTRACT>
A method of detecting a misfire of an ignition 
system for an internal combustion engine is provided. 

By the method, after completion of spark discharge of a 
spark plug, a high tension pulse which is not so high 

as to cause spark discharge is applied to each spark 
plug by way of a reverse current preventing diode and a 

secondary winding of an ignition coil or by way of a 
reverse current preventing diode and a leakage 

preventing diode for preventing ingress of an ignition 
high voltage, and a misfire at each cylinders is 

detected on the basis of a voltage attenuation 
characteristic at a passing side terminal of the 

reverse current preventing diode. A device for 
carrying out the above method is also provided.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a method of
detecting a misfire of an ignition system for a multi-cylinder
internal combustion engine and a device for
carrying out the same.A prior art (JP 5-106 545 A) ignition system of the type having a
distributor is shown in Fig. 10. The distributor type
ignition system includes an ignition coil 901, a
battery 903 and a power transistor 904 both connected
to a primary winding 902 of the ignition coil 901, an
engine control unit (ECU) 905 for supplying an ignition
signal to the power transistor 904, a distributor 907
for distribution of a high voltage induced in a
secondary winding 906, and spark plugs 908 ∼ 911
connected to side electrodes of the distributor 907.A single-ended distributorless ignition system
shown in Fig. 11 is also disclosed and used with a view to
reducing the radio noise interference and increasing
the reliability. The ignition system shown in Fig. 11
is of the type for use in a two-cylinder engine and
consists of ignition coils 920 and 921, power
transistors 924 and 925 for intermittently allowing
battery current to flow to primary windings 922 and 923
of the ignition coils 920 and 921, an engine control
unit (ECU) 926 for sending an ignition signal to the
power transistors 924 and 925 and spark plugs 927 and
928.In the distributor type ignition system shown in
Fig. 10, it has heretofore been practiced to install 
thereon a misfire detecting device which consists of a
voltage dividing circuit made up of coupling condensers
914, 915, 916 and 917 of a small capacity, a condenser
918 of a relatively large capacity and a resistor 919,
and a misfire detecting circuit 913, and detects a
misfire of the spark plug at each cylinder on the basis
of the attenuation characteristic of the divided
voltage.In the single-ended distributorless ignition
system shown in Fig. 11, it has heretofore been
practiced to install thereon a misfire detecting device
which consists of a voltage divider made up of coupling
condensers 929 and 930 of a small capacity, a condenser
931 of a relatively large capacity and a resistor 932,
and a misfire detecting circuit 933, and detects a
misfire of the spark plug at each cylinder on the basis
of the attenuation characteristic of the divided
voltage.The misfire detecting device for installation on
the distributor type ignition system requires the
coupling condensers 914, 915, 916 and 917 of the small
capacity, of the same number as the cylinders and a
fixing device for fixing the condensers to high-tension
cords, thus increasing the cost.
