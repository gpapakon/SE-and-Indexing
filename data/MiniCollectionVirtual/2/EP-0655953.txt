 BRITTLE OXIDE SUBSTRATES STRENGTHENED BY CROSS-LINKABLE SILANESBACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION This application is a continuation-in-part of U.S. Serial No. 08/043,980, filed April 7, 1993, which is a continuation of U.S. Serial No. 07/873,315 filed April 24, 1992, now abandoned, which is a continuation-in-part of U.S. Serial No. 07/575,052, filed August 30, 1990, now abandoned. This application is also a continuation-in-part of U.S. Serial No. 07/986,894 filed December 8, 1992, which is a continuation of U.S. Serial No. 07/738,030 filed July 30, 1991, now abandoned, which was a division of U.S. Serial No. 07/575,052 filed August 30, 1990, now abandoned.The present invention relates to a method of strengthen¬ ing a brittle oxide substrate and also relates to aqueous solutions containing silane-based compositions and polymerized cross-linked siloxane coated brittle oxide substrates. More particularly, the present invention relates to a method of strengthening or restoring strength to a glass container and the resulting polymerized cross-linked siloxane coated glass container.Brittle materials, such as glass substrates, generally exhibit some mechanical properties, such as, e.g., tensile strength, which are substantially lower than predicted. This manifestation can arise as the result of such factors as imperfections in the structure of a test specimen, or small amounts of impurities in either the body or the surface of an article made of that material. Progressive zone melting to reform the crystalline structure and floating impurities out 

of the melted brittle material have been used in the past for brittle metals in an attempt to improve the mechanical prop¬ erties of the brittle metals. Also, with regard to non-metal brittle materials, multi-layer structures made of the brittle material have been used to improve mechanical properties. In addition, surface treatments of the brittle material have been used to protect the surface "from abrasion and to provide a small measure of support to brittle articles.Glass is intrinsically one of the strongest materials known to man. Theoretically, standard silicate glasses should be able to support stresses as high as 14 to 20 giga- pascals (2 to 3 million pounds per square inch (psi)). In practice, however, the strengths typically obtained are on the order of 70 megapascals (MPa), about 10,000 psi.The explanation of the discrepancy between predicted and measured values is the existence of surface flaws or cracks. These flaws essentially fracture the siloxane
