<ABSTRACT>
Process for the alkylation of a hydrocarbon 
feedstock with an olefinic alkylating agent comprising the 

steps of contacting the hydrocarbon feedstock and the 
olefinic alkylating agent with a fluorinated alkoxy alkane 

sulphonic acid catalyst for a sufficient time and recovering 
a product stream of alkylated hydrocarbons.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to the alkylation of 
paraffinic hydrocarbons with olefinic alkylation agent in 
the presence of an acid catalyst. It is well known that a number of strong acids 
catalyses the alkylation of isoalkanes with olefins to 
yield alkylate gasoline. Among the suitable catalysts is 
sulphuric acid, hydrogen fluoride and fluorinated sulphonic 
acids (U.S. Patent No. 5,220,095). We have now found that when the alkylation reaction 
is performed using a fluorinated sulphonic acid containing 
a weakly basic group, such as an ether linkage as catalyst, 
the product quality is of higher quality as compared to the 
product obtained by using perfluorinated sulphonic acids 
without a basic group under similar conditions. Accordingly, this invention provides a process for 
the alkylation of a hydrocarbon feedstock with an olefinic 
alkylating agent comprising the steps of contacting the 
hydrocarbon feedstock and the olefinic alkylating agent 
with a fluorinated alkoxy alkane sulphonic acid catalyst 
for a sufficient time and recovering a product stream of 
alkylated hydrocarbons. In a specific embodiment of the invention, the 
hydrocarbon feedstock is contacted with the catalyst in a 
fixed bed of solid contact material. Suitable contact materials for use in the invention 
include the non-basic refractory materials, preferably 
silica. It is further preferred to carry out the process as 
a supported liquid phase process, wherein the catalyst is 
moveable supported on the contact material within a confined 
area thereof, as described in U.S. Patent 5,220,095, 
which by reference is incorporated herein. With the inventive process it is possible to perform 
alkylation at higher temperatures or with a lower 
isobutane recycle than in the known processes.  
 The high alkylate quality as indicated by higher 
octane numbers is caused in part by a higher selectivity to 
the production of C8-carbonhydrates, having higher concentrations 
of trimethylpentanes in the C8-fraction. A 100 ml reactor was packed with dried silica gel 
of the type Merck 100, 0.2-0.5 mm particle size. 6 ml perfluorinated 
2-ethoxyethylsulphonic acid (C2F5-O-C2F4-SO3H) 
were introduced into the reactor. A feed stream containing 
5% 2-butene in isobutane was then passed through the silica 
gel contact material at a feed rate of 2.5 g/min. at temperatures 
varying in the range of from 0-30Â°C. The product compositions 
were determined by gas chromatographic analysis and 
the octane numbers estimated from these compositions. The
