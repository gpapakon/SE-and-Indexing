<ABSTRACT>
The mud flap has a general shape to fit most mudguard profiles, with a stiff edge (2) to locate the in the mounting grips. Alongside the stiff edge is a softer strip (3) extending over most of the width of the flap. This soft strip is compressed in set areas when the flap is fitted to the mudguard and ensures a snug fit. The soft strip can be made in the same moulding as the flap by having a thin walled, corrugated section or can be a fabric insert section. The mounting edge has a lip which is gripped by the wire reinforced mounting grip secured to the mudguard. The vertical edges of the flap are stiffened by ribbing (4).

Mud flap for motor cars having a flap body to be attached 
to an, in particular three-dimensionally curved, outside edge of 

a wing, the flap body (1) ending towards the wing (16) with a 
stripe-shaped attachment section (2) having a small extension 

perpendicular to the outside edge (19) of the wing (16), and the 
flap body (1) having a reduced deformation resistance, as 

compared to the rest of the flap body (1), within a deformation 
region (3) directly adjoining the attachment section (2), 

totally surrounded by the rest of the flap body (1) and having 
a two-dimensional extension along the attachment section (2), 


characterized in that
 for adaption of the mud flap to different 
wing shapes (6), the deformation region (3) is elastically 

and/or plastically deformable also in the main extension 
direction of the flap body (1). 
Mud flap according to claim 1, 
characterized in that
 the 
flap body (1) is reinforced at its side edges, running away from 

the wing (16), right in the attachment section (2). 
Mud flap according to claim 1 or 2, 
characterized in that
 
the deformation region (3) is made of the same material as the 

rest of the flap body (1), the material, in the deformation 
region (3), being arranged in folds and having a smaller 

material thickness than in the rest of the flap body (1). 
Mud flap according to claim 1 or 2, 
characterized in that
 
a deformable wire or textile cloth (9) is provided in the 

deformation region (3).  
 
Mud flap according to one of the claims 1 to 4, 

characterized in that
 the attachment section (2), over its 
substantial lengthwise extension along the outside edge (19) of 

the wing (16), comprises a bulge-shaped strengthening (5) for 
putting in a groove-shaped exclusion (13) closed at one of its 

ends and provided in an attachment part (10) to be arranged at 
the outside edge (19) of the wing (16). 
Mud flap according to claim 5, 
characterized in that
 the 
attachment part (10) comprises a one-part main body made of a 

deformable material and having a continuous sealing lip for 
laying against the wing (16) and support parts (12) for the flap 

body (1) which are at distances apart from each other and 
comprise the groove-shaped exclusion (13). 
Mud flap according to claim 6, 
characterized in that
 a 
plastically deformable wire (15) running along the outside edge 

(19) of the wing (16) is provided within the main body of the 
attachment part (10). 
Mud flap according to claim 6 or 7, 
characterized in that
 
clamping elements (17) are hinged to some support elements (12) 

via film hinges (18), which clamping elements (17) gripping 
around the outside edge (19) of the wing (16) are forceable 

towards the sealing lip (11) of the attachment part (10) by 
clamping screws (20) or clamping springs.
