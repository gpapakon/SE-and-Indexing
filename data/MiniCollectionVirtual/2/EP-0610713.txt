<ABSTRACT>
The present invention relates to a rubber stock 
containing 0.1 to 10.0 phr of phenoxyacetic acid. 

Addition of the phenoxyacetic acid to a rubber stock 
increases the low strain stiffness properties of the 

rubber stock and results in increased treadwear when 
the stock is used in tread stocks. The phenoxyacetic 

acid may also be used in a rubber stock as a methylene 
acceptor or resorcinol replacement. In addition, the 

phenoxyacetic acid functions as a silica coupling 
agent and provides lower viscosities for processing 

the rubber stock compared to rubber stocks containing 
conventional silane coupling agents.

<DESCRIPTION>
A pneumatic tire is a polymeric composite and 
typically contains scores of ingredients, each of 
which are added to achieve a specific function and 
overcome a problem. A frequent problem in making a 
rubber composite is maintaining good adhesion between 
the rubber and the reinforcement. A conventional 
method in promoting the adhesion between the rubber 
and the reinforcement is to generate a resin in-situ 
(in the vulcanized rubber/textile matrix) by 
compounding a vulcanizable rubber stock with a 
phenol/formaldehyde condensation product. The 
components of the condensation product consist of a 
methylene acceptor and a methylene donor. The most 
common methylene donors include N-(substituted 
oxymethyl) melamine, hexamethylenetetramine or 
hexamethoxymethylmelamine. A common methylene 
acceptor is a dihydroxybenzene compound such as 
resorcinol. Resorcinol is known to form a resin 
network within a rubbery polymer by reacting with 
various methylene donors. Unfortunately, the use of 
resorcinol has some inherent disadvantages. 
Resorcinol is not readily dispersed in rubber and in 
fact neither the resin, nor the resorcinol become 
chemically bound to the rubber. Additionally, 
resorcinol in its raw form is excessively volatile and 
is potentially an environmental hazard. Therefore, 
there exists a need to find a suitable resorcinol 
replacement. In silica filled rubber stocks, silane coupling 
agents are commonly used. Silane coupling agents are 
in principle characterized by dual functionality. One 
function is an organo-functional group (such as aminoalkyl, 
mercaptoalkyl, etc.) and the other functional  
 
group is a readily hydrolyzable alkoxy group (such as 
OCH₃ or OCH₂H₅). In use, the alkoxy groups readily 
hydrolyze in the presence of moisture typically found 
on the surface of silica to form silanols that react 
with or otherwise condense in the presence of silica 
surface. The organo functional group reacts with the 
polymer matrix during vulcanization. In sulfur cured 
elastomers, mercaptosilanes are odoriferous, usually 
from impurities in the product. Mercaptosilanes also 
can act as cure accelerators and may tend to make the 
rubber compound scorchy. Because the alkoxy groups of 
the coupling agents readily hydrolyze upon storage, 
they are not as reactive. Therefore, there exists a 
need to find a suitable replacement for silane 
coupling agents. Surprisingly, the present invention includes the 
use of phenoxyacetic acid in a rubber stock. The 
phenoxyacetic acid may function as a
