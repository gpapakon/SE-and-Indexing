<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a structure of 
a protective circuit for use in a semiconductor device and, 
in particular, to an overcurrent protective circuit to 
protect a switching element in a semiconductor device using 
an insulated gate type semiconductor switching element such 
as an IGBT from an overcurrent. Fig. 12 shows a circuit diagram of a conventional 
semiconductor device which includes an overcurrent 
protective circuit. The conventional semiconductor device 
includes an insulated gate type bipolar transistor (which 
will be abbreviated as IGBT) 10 as a switching element and 
a current limit circuit 20. The IGBT 10 is a power 
semiconductor device which is able to control a large 
current under a high voltage. In the semiconductor device, 
an external terminal P1, which provides a high potential, 
is connected to a collector 11 of the IGBT 10, and an 
external terminal P2, which provides a low potential, is 
connected to an emitter 12 of the IGBT 10. And, by 
controlling a gate potential Vg to be applied to a gate 
electrode 13 of the IGBT 10, the current of a load circuit 
to be connected to the external terminals P1 and P2 can be 
controlled. Further, the IGBT 10 includes a sensing  
 
emitter 14 which is used to sense or detect a current, in 
addition to the emitter 12 to be connected to the external 
terminal P2. That is, the IGBT 10, as shown in Fig. 13 in 
terms of an equivalent circuit, includes a main insulated 
gate type switching element (main IGBT) T₁ and a current-detecting 
insulated gate type switching element (sub IGBT) 
T₂ connected in parrell to the main IGBT. The emitter of the 
current-detecting insulated gate type switching element T₂ 
is the sensing emitter 14. The gate electrode 13 comprises 
a gate electrode 13a of the main insulated gate type 
switching element T₁ and a gate electrode 13b of the 
current-detecting insulated gate type switching element T₂. 
The sensing emitter 14 is connected to the external 
terminal P2 through a current sensing resistor 21. For 
this reason, from the sensing emitter 14, a current is 
allowed to flow out which is proportional to a current 
flowing between the collector 11 and emitter 12 of the main 
insulated gate type switching element T₁. The current limit 
circuit 20 comprises the current sensing resistor 21, a 
diode 35 for preventing an inverse current, and an n-channel 
MOSFET 30 connected through the inverse current 
preventive diode 35 to a gate line 15 to which a gate 
control signal is supplied by a gate drive circuit
