<DESCRIPTION>
This invention is directed to a cathodic 
electrocoating composition and in particular to a 
cathodic electrocoating composition containing a flow 
control agent which improves the smoothness of an 
electrodeposited film of the composition. The coating of electrically conductive 
substrates by an electrodeposition process (also 
called an electrocoating process) is a well known and 
important industrial process. Electrodeposition of 
primers to automotive substrates is widely used in the 
automotive industry. In this process, a conductive 
article, such as an autobody or an auto part, is 
immersed in a bath of a coating composition of an 
aqueous emulsion of film forming polymer and acts as 
an electrode in the electrodeposition process. An 
electric current is passed between the article and a 
counter-electrode in electrical contact with the 
agueous emulsion, until a desired coating is deposited 
on the article. In a cathodic electrocoating process, 
the article to be coated is the cathode and the 
counter-electrode is the anode. Resin compositions used in the bath of a 
typical cathodic electrodeposition process also are 
well known in the art. These resins typically are 
made from polyepoxide resins which have been chain 
extended and then an adduct is formed to include amine 
groups in the resin. Amine groups typically are 
introduced through reaction of the resin with an amine 
compound. These resins are blended with a crosslinking 
agent and then neutralized with an acid to form a  
 
water emulsion which is usually referred to as a 
principal emulsion. The principal emulsion is combined with a 
pigment paste, coalescent solvents, water, and other 
additives to form the electrocoating bath. The 
electrocoating bath is placed in an insulated tank 
containing the anode. The article to be coated is the 
cathode and is passed through the tank containing the 
electrodeposition bath. The thickness of the coating 
that is deposited on the article being electrocoated 
is a function of the bath characteristics, the 
electrical operating characteristics, the immersion 
time, and the like. The resulting coated article is removed from 
the bath after a set period of time and is rinsed with 
deionized water. The coating on the article is cured 
typically in an oven at sufficient temperature to 
produce a crosslinked finish on the article. Cathodic electrocoating compositions and 
resin compositions, coating baths, and cathodic 
electrodeposition processes are disclosed in
