<ABSTRACT>
Preparation of a formulation for mitigating ill effects of smoking, wherein 
one or more of the n-6 EFAs selected from GLA, DGLA and AA, and one or 

more of the n-3 EFAs selected from SA, 20:4n-3, EPA, DPA or DHA are used, 
preferably so that the daily dose of each fatty acid is within the range 1mg to 

100g/day. The formulation may in many other purposes be used in the treatment 
or prevention of ageing of the skin of smokers.

<DESCRIPTION>
Smoking is established as a major factor in many different health problems 
but particularly in lung cancer, in chronic lung problems such as bronchitis, and 
in coronary and peripheral arterial disease. However, despite a great deal of 
work, the mechanism of smoking-induced damage has not been adequately 
elucidated. Moreover there are important anomalies in the association between 
smoking and disease. For example, although cigarettes smoked in Japan are 
similar to those elsewhere, and although the physiological and biochemical 
changes induced by smoking are similar in Japanese and in other people, 
smoking seems much less harmful in Japan than it is in other countries. There 
has been no adequate explanation for this. As part of an investigation on peripheral vascular disease, 120 normal 
individuals between the ages of 40 and 70, and 120 patients with peripheral 
vascular disease completed a detailed questionnaire on their smoking habits. As 
a result an estimate was made for each person of lifetime consumption of 
cigarettes. This was related to the severity of peripheral vascular disease using 
the ankle/brachial pressure index (ABPI) as a measure. In a normal individual 
in the supine position, the blood pressure at the ankle and in the arm is identical 
and the index ankle pressure/arm pressure is 1.0. With increasing severity of 
arterial disease which almost invariably affects the leg arteries more than the 
arm, the pressure at the ankle falls below that in the arm. The ABPI is therefore 
a measure of the severity of blockage of the leg arteries.  The lifetime number of cigarettes smoked was found to be inversely related 
to the ABPI. The greater the amount of smoking the greater was the blocking of 
the femoral artery, the main artery to the leg. The relationship was very highly 
significant (P<0.001). This observation supported much earlier work linking 
smoking to arterial disease. Blood samples were taken from all individuals in the study. The lipids 
were extracted from plasma and separated into phospholipid, cholesterol ester 
and triglyceride fractions by thin layer chromatography. Each fraction was then 
methylated and the composition of the resulting fatty acid methyl esters 
measured by quantitative gas chromatography. The essential fatty acids were 
measured and their concentrations related to lifetime smoking by Spearman's 
rank correlation. The significance and direction of the correlations are 
summarised in Table 1. Correlations were made between smoking habit (lifetime
