<ABSTRACT>
The present invention has as its object to detect reliably and 
highly accurately the exhaustion of ink 

in an ink jet recording apparatus. An ink cartridge (2) 
has an opening (5) for connection to a recording head (1), 

and is comprised of a negative pressure generating 
member containing portion (14) containing a negative 

pressure generating member (13) and having an atmosphere 
communicating port (10), and an ink containing portion (16) 

which is adjacent to the negative pressure generating 
member containing portion (14) and communicates therewith 

at the bottom (11) of the ink cartridge. Ink detecting 
means (3) is provided below the ink containing portion 

(16). When the detecting means (3) detects a reduction in 
the remain in the ink containing portion (16), ink 

remains only in the negative pressure generating member 
containing portion (14) and the remainder can be 

substantially estimated. For the remaining ink, the 
amount of use is calculated by the counting of 

discharge pulses or the like and is compared, whereby 
the remain of the ink can be detected accurately and 

easily.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an ink remain state detecting
system detecting an ink remain state of an ink containing member
and a method of detecting the remain state. The system and
method are intended for
detecting ink termination in an
ink storing container or the like of an ink jet
recording apparatus for discharging ink to thereby
effect recording.
Particularly,
this invention relates to an ink remain state detecting
system for and a method of detecting the remain state
of ink contained in an ink storing container comprising
a plurality of containing members capable of containing
ink which communicate in different states.In a so-called ink jet recording apparatus, ink is
discharged from a recording head to thereby effect
recording on a recording medium such as recording
paper.An ink storing device such as an ink tank for
storing therein ink to be supplied to the recording
head is mounted on a predetermined fixed region of the
ink jet recording apparatus, or is carried on a
carriage with the recording head. In the former case, 
an ink supply path such as an ink tube is provided
between the recording head and the storing device, and
this is designed to follow the movement of the
carriage.In the latter case, the ink supply path provided
between the recording head and the storing device can
be made relatively short. Therefore, the construction
in which the ink storing device is carried on the
carriage can be said to be a construction suitable for
downsizing or simplifying the ink jet recording
apparatus.Among such constructions in which the recording
head and the ink storing device (ink tank) are both
carried on the carriage, there are a construction in
which the recording head and the ink tank are formed
integrally with each other and a construction in which
the recording head and the ink tank are separably
carried. In the construction wherein the recording
head and the ink tank are formed integrally with each
other, a cartridge comprising the ink tank and the
recording head made integral with each other is
interchanged with a new one at a point of time whereat
the ink in the ink tank has become exhausted and
therefore, this construction is easy to handle and thus
has been spreading in recent years, but the expensive
head is interchanged each time the ink becomes
exhausted and this leads to the rise of running cost. Also, in the construction wherein the recording
head and the ink tank are separably carried, the ink
tank alone can be interchanged when the ink becomes
exhausted, and the head itself
