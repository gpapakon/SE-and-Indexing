<ABSTRACT>
A bag includes a front part (1), a bottom part (2), a 
back part (3) and gusset parts (6). The front part (1), the 

bottom part (2) and the back part (3) are unified to be a 
bag body. Both sides of the bag body are provided with one 

sides of slide fasteners (5) on hem portions which connect 
with the gusset parts (6). The gusset parts (6) are 

provided with the other sides of the slide fasteners (7) on 
hem portions thereof. The fasteners (5, 7) are disengaged 

to release each part to open and spread the bag and engaged 
to make it up. With the bag being opened and spread 

substantially flat, objects may be readily received in and 
taken out of the bag regardless of the size and shape.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a bag in which 
objects are easily received and from which the objects are 
easily taken out. A known bag includes a front part, a back part, a 
bottom part and a gusset part which connects the front, back 
and bottom parts and these parts are sewed up three 
dimensionally to provide receiving space therein. The 
receiving space has an opening through which objects are 
taken in and out. The opening of this kind of bag, however, has a 
limited size so that objects of relatively large size or 
special shape and the like may not be easily taken in or 
out. It is hence a primary object of the present invention 
to provide a bag in which objects are easily received and 
from which the objects are easily taken out. A bag of the present invention includes a front part, 
a bottom part, a back part, and a pair of gusset parts. The 
first three parts make up a bag body. Each gusset part has 
one side of each slide fastener along its hem, and hem 
portions of both sides of the bag body which make a 
connection with the hems of the gusset parts are provided 
with the other sides of the slide fasteners. Here in the  
 
description one of one side or the other side of a slide 
fastener includes teeth (or coil) and a slide and the other 
includes teeth (or coil), and the foregoing one side and 
other side make up a fastener. Opening or releasing the 
slide fasteners of the gusset parts and the bag body 
enables to open and spread the bag substantially flat, while 
closing or engaging the slide fasteners makes up the three-dimensional 
bag. The bag body and the gusset parts may be partially 
fixed together, or they may be detachable from each other 
so that the gussets may be exchanged for another pair. When a relatively large size object is to be put into 
the bag of the present invention, the slide fasteners of the 
bag body and the pair of the gussets are disengaged to 
release each part. At this point, the bag is opened or 
spread to be flat. The relatively large size object may be 
received on the flat-opened bag and then the slide fasteners 
of the bag body and gussets are closed. Consequently, the 
objects is received in the three-dimensional bag. Since objects are received in the bag or taken out of 
it when the bag is opened or spread flat, sizes of objects 
to be received therein are not limited to the size of the 
inherent opening of the bag. In addition, when the pair of gussets are designed to 
be detachable from the bag body and exchangeable for another 
pair, exchanging
