<DESCRIPTION>
 EXPRESSION OF ANTIMICROBIALPEPTIDE GENES IN PLANTS, AND THEIR USE INCREATING RESISTANCE TO MULTIPLE PLANT PATHOGENSThis application claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional Application No. 60/054,315, filed July 31, 1997.BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION Field of the InventionThe present invention relates to transgenic plants having surprisingly improved resistance to plant pathogens due to expressed antimicrobial peptide genes, particularly Magainin and PGL classes of peptide genes, in the plants. Description of the Related ArtIn recent years, it has become widely recognized that many organisms, including plants, utilize peptides as a component of their host defense strategies (for review see Hancock and Lehrer. Trends In Biotechnology 16:82-88 (1998) or Broekaert et al., Critical Reviews in Plant Sciences 16:297-323 (1997)). These broad-spectrum antibiotic peptides have been shown to be active against Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria, fungi and protozoa. Overexpression of both plant- and non-plant-derived (e.g., amphibian and insect) antimicrobial peptides with antimicrobial activity in transgenic plants has been touted by some as a means to confer pest resistance in crop plants. However, published reports describing transgenic tobacco plants expressing antimicrobial peptides revealed generally disappointing results (Florak et al., Transgenic Res. 4:132-141 (1995)).In several cases, the antimicrobial peptides failed to accumulate to significant amounts within the plant cell as rapid degradation of the peptide was observed. For this reason, and also due to serious concerns about potentially phytotoxic effects exerted by the antimicrobial peptides when expressed in plants, plant scientists have not aggressively pursued this technology. Antimicrobial peptides can be classified into many categories based upon their structure(e.g., linear vs. cyclic), their size (20-45 amino acids) and their source (e.g., insect, amphibian, plant). However, despite their apparent diversity, numerous defense-related peptides have the common features of being highly basic and being capable of forming amphipathic structures. These unifying features suggest that most peptides appear to act by a direct lysis of the pathogenic cell membrane. Their basic structure facilitates their interaction with the cell membrane, and their 

amphipathic nature allow them to be incorporated into the membrane ultimately disrupting its structure.Frog skin secretions of the African clawed frog, Xenopus laevis, have been discovered to be a
