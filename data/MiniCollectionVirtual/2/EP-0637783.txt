<ABSTRACT>
A cement mixing and pumping simulator comprises 
cement mixing equipment (502,504) virtual cement mixing 

equipment disposed with the actual cement mixing equipment, 

virtual pumping equipment (506) and means for generating 
signals (506) representing operating characteristics of a 

cement mixing system realistically represented by the actual 
and virtual equipment are generated. These signals are 

communicated for displaying the operating characteristics to 
the operator so that the operator obtains real-time 

responses to the operator's control of the actual and 
virtual equipment.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates generally to a cement 
mixing and pumping simulator and to a method of simulating 
operation of a cement mixing system. During the creation of an oil or gas well, a cement 
slurry containing a mixture of water, cement and other 
materials typically needs to be made at the well site prior to 
being pumped into the well such as for cementing a tubular 
casing or liner in the wellbore. The slurry usually needs to 
have one or more specific characteristics, such as a desired 
density. Although the cement mixing process used at oil or 
gas well sites has been automated to a certain extent to 
obtain more readily any such desired characteristics, it still 
requires a skilled human operator to ensure that the process 
is carried out in accordance with a predetermined plan. The 
operator should be skilled enough to do this even when 
malfunctions or deviations occur. One way to obtain skilled operators is to have them learn 
on the job. Although this may be necessary in some instances, 
it is not preferred because of the obvious risk that the 
operator might perform poorly and damage the well. This can 
result in wasted material and money, and it can also result in  
 
injury to personnel and damage to equipment. Furthermore, on-the-job 
training is a slow process because the operator cannot 
immediately repeat or try another cement mixing process at an 
actual well site. Another shortcoming of on-the-job training 
is that it is difficult to evaluate the operator because 
sufficient data defining the operator's performance is 
typically not available. An enhanced training process is for an operator-trainee 
to use a simulator or simulation method. This type of 
training does not jeopardize an actual well, and it allows the 
operator to work through multiple cementing jobs and 
conditions in a relatively short period of time. Although 
there are cement mixing simulators and simulation methods, 
these require that actual materials and complete cement mixing 
systems be used. These have disadvantages such as being 
expensive since actual materials and complete systems are used 
and such as necessitating disposal of the materials which are 
created but which are not actually used in cementing in a 
well. These simulators can also be relatively unsafe because 
they actually run equipment, such as high pressure pumps, that 
can malfunction or be improperly operated whereby hazardous 
situations can arise. In view of at least the aforementioned shortcomings of 
these prior training techniques,
