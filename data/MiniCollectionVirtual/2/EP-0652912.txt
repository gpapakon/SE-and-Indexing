<ABSTRACT>
A method for the removal and recovery of paint overspray in a water wash spray booth is disclosed. The method uses a circulating agitated dispersion of an organic solvent component in water which collects the paint overspray. The dispersion containing the overspray is permitted to phase separate into an organic phase and an aqueous phase. The organic phase is further treated such as by distillation to separate the paint solids from an organic solvent portion which contains the original organic solvent component and the organic solvents associated with the paint. The organic solvent portion can be recycled and reused in the circulating dispersion and the paint solids can be recovered for further use such as a filler for adhesives or can be disposed of.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a paint overspray removal
process and more particularly to a process which enables recovery and
reuse of the components of the paint overspray.Automatic spraying techniques have long been employed for
painting large articles such as cars, trucks, refrigerators, etc.
The items being sprayed are generally advanced along a conveyor line
which passes through a water wash paint spray booth where a fine
spray of paint is directed at the articles being painted from spray
guns which are located at the sides of the conveyor. Overspray
paint, that is, paint which does not contact the article being
painted, forms a fine mist of paint in the air space surrounding the
painted article. This paint mist must be removed from the air. To
accomplish this, the contaminated air is pulled through the paint
spray booth by air exhaust fans. A curtain of circulating water is
maintained across the path of the air in such a manner such that the
air must pass through the water curtain to reach the exhaust fans.
As the air passes through the water curtain, the paint mist is
"scrubbed" from the air and carried to a sump basin usually located
below the paint spray booth. In this area, the paint particles are
separated from the water so that the water may be recycled and the
paint particles disposed of.One of the difficulties with recovering paint overspray in a
water wash spray booth as described above is the limited amount of
paint which can be incorporated into the water. Paint is a tacky
material and it tends to flocculate and adhere to the spray booth
surfaces, particularly in the sump and drain areas and must
constantly be removed from the sump to prevent clogging of the sump 
drain and recirculating system. This is generally accomplished by
shoveling which is costly and time consuming. Although it is known
in the art to add detackifiers to the circulating water system to
detackify the paint so that it will not adhere to the surfaces of the
spray booth and be easier to remove from the system, the paint
content in the circulating water system must still be kept relatively
low to prevent paint flocculation. Typically, the circulating water
systems with conventional detackifiers contain from about 1 to 5
percent by weight paint overspray based on total weight of the
circulating water.It is known in the art, for example, in U.S. 4,854,947 and
U.S. 4,919,691, to use oil-in-water emulsions in the circulating
water to scrub and to detackify the paint overspray. By using these
oil-in-water emulsions, a

A method for the removal and recovery of paint
overspray which contains pigments, organic resins and organic

solvents in paint spray booths comprising:

(1) contacting said paint overspray which contains
paint solids and organic solvent portion with an agitated

dispersion of an organic solvent component in water so as to
collect the paint overspray in the agitated dispersion; said

organic solvent component being characterized as having a
solubility in water of less than 15 percent by weight and in

which water is soluble in the organic solvent component to
an extent of less than 15 percent by weight, the percentages

by weight being based on weight of organic solvent component
and water, said organic solvent component having a specific

gravity less than 0.98 or greater than 1.02; said dispersion
being stable in the presence of agitation but unstable in

the absence of agitation;
(2) passing the dispersion containing the paint
overspray to an area relatively free of agitation so as to

cause the dispersion to spontaneously phase separate into an
organic phase containing paint overspray and an aqueous

phase;
(3) separating the organic phase from the aqueous
phase;
(4) treating the organic phase to separate the paint
solids from the organic solvent portion;
(5) dispersing said organic solvent portion with said
agitated dispersion for subsequent contact with said paint

overspray;
(6) recovering the portion which contains the paint
solids.
