<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method for the determination of the amount of a ligand in a sample of a biological
fluid, in which the biological fluid containing the ligand to be determined is incubated in the presence of a dissolved
ligand derivative, which can be converted into an insoluble form, in the liquid phase with less than the stoichiometric
amount of a labelled specific binder which binds both the ligand to be determined and the ligand derivative so that the
ligand to be determined and the ligand derivative compete for the labelled specific binder, and in which the ligand
derivative is converted into an insoluble form and, after separation of the insoluble components of the assay system
from those components of the assay system remaining in the liquid phase, the amount of the ligand to be determined
in the biological fluid is calculated from the amount of the labelled specific binder bound to the ligand derivative, and
a kit for carrying out such a method.The present invention relates in particular to a method of the stated type for the determination of the free proportion
of a monovalent ligand, i.e. of a ligand which represents a monovalent antigen or a hapten, which is to say that it has
only one binding site for the immunological binding by a specific binding partner, namely a thyroid hormone, which is
present in biological fluids partly in a form bound to its physiological binding proteins and partly in unbound, i.e. free,
form, and the object of the process is the quantitative determination of this free proportion.The method according to the invention is one of the immunological assay methods in which labelled antibodies
(labelled specific binders) are employed and which are also referred to as immunometric assay methods. It belongs
to the version of such methods which is referred to as a competitive method. In contrast to typical sandwich methods,
in which the total amount of the ligand to be determined is bound in a sandwich, a proportion of the labelled binding
partner is bound to the ligand to be determined and a further proportion to a competing derivative of this ligand. Further
statements on various types of immunometric assay methods are to be found in the introduction of EP-B-89806 in
which, exactly as in EP-B-103605, the immunometric version of a method for the determination of free proportions of
ligands is described, which method is described as the so-called analogue tracer assay method in EP-B-26103.In immunometric methods of the type according to the invention for the

<CLAIMS>
A method for the quantitative determination of the proportion of the free form of a thyroid hormone ligand (L) in a
sample of a biological fluid, which ligand (L) is present partly in said free form and also partly in a form in which it

is bound to physiological binding proteins, in which method the biological fluid containing the free ligand (L) to be
determined is incubated in the presence of a ligand derivative, which ligand derivative has a considerably reduced

binding capability with respect to the physiological binding proteins and is able to be converted into an insoluble
form, in the liquid phase with less than the stoichiometric amount of a labelled specific binder (Ak*) which in an

immunological binding reaction specifically binds both the free ligand (L) to be determined and the ligand derivative
so that the free ligand (L) to be determined and the ligand derivative compete for the labelled specific binder (Ak*),

and in which the ligand derivative is converted into an insoluble form, and, after separation of the insoluble components
of the assay system from those components of the assay system which remain in the liquid phase, the

amount of the free ligand (L) to be determined in the biological fluid is calculated from the amount of the labelled
specific binder (Ak*) bound to the insolubilized ligand derivative,
characterised in that
 a soluble conjugate of the thyroid hormone ligand with an immunoglobulin is used as the
ligand derivative (L-IgG), and that the reaction is carried out in a test tube whose walls are coated with a protein

material (anti-IgG) which specifically binds the immunoglobulin part of the ligand derivative (L-IgG) without affecting
the bond between the ligand part of the conjugate and the specific binder (Ak*), said protein material (anti-IgG)

being selected from anti-idiotypical immunoglobulins and anti-idiotypical poly- or monoclonal antibodies against
the immunoglobulin part of the ligand derivative (L-IgG) such that the binding between the immunoglobulin part of

the ligand derivative (L-IgG) and the protein material (anti-IgG) takes place more slowly than the immunological
binding reaction between the free ligand (L) or the ligand part of the ligand derivative (L-IgG) and the labelled

specific binder (Ak*).
Method according to Claim 1, 
characterised in that
 it is a method for the determination of the free proportion of
thyroxine (FT4), that the ligand derivative (L-IgG) is a thyroxine-IgG conjugate and that the protein material (anti-IgG)

bound to the walls of the test tube is an anti-idiotypical IgG against the IgG part of the ligand derivative (L-IgG).
Method according to Claim 2, 
characterised in that
 the ligand derivative (L-IgG) is a thyroxine-rabbit IgG conjugate
and that the anti-idiotypical IgG (anti-IgG) is a goat anti-rabbit IgG or a goat anti-rabbit antibody.
Method according to any of Claims 1 to 3, 
characterised in that
 the walls of the test tube are coated with an amount
of said protein material (anti-IgG) which is at least sufficient for completely binding the total amount of the ligand

derivative used (L-IgG), that the amount of the ligand derivative used (L-IgG) is of the order of 0.5 to 20 times the
molar amount based on the amount of free ligand to be determined (L) which is to be expected in a normal patient,

and that the labelled specific binder (Ak*) is used in a sub-stoichiometric amount such that only a portion of the
total amount of free ligand (L) to be determined and ligand derivative (L-IgG) present in the sample reacts with the

labelled specific binder (Ak*).
Method according to any of claims 2 to 4, wherein said specific binder (Ak*) is a labelled monoclonal antibody to
T4 which does react neither with the immunoglobulin part of the ligand derivative (L-IgG) nor the protein material

(anti-IgG). 
Method of any of claims 1 to 5, wherein said immunoglobulin part of the ligand derivative (L-IgG) is a native immunoglobulin.
Method according to any of Claims 1 to 6, 
characterised in that
 it is carried out in the following sequence of incubation
steps:


a) - provision of a test tube whose walls are coated with an excess of protein material (anti-IgG) which specifically
binds the immunoglobulin part of the ligand derivative (L-IgG);
b) - addition of the biological fluid containing an unknown amount of the free thyroid hormone ligand (L) to be
determined or of a standard solution of said ligand (L);
c) - addition of a solution or dispersion which contains a known amount of the ligand derivative (L-IgG); and
d) - addition of a solution or dispersion which contains a known amount of the labelled specific binder (Ak*);

and that, after an adequate incubation period, the liquid phase is removed from the test tube, the latter is washed
and then the amount of the free thyroid hormone ligand (L) in the sample is determined from the proportion of the

labelled specific binder (Ak*) bound to the walls of the test tube, with reference to the results for standard samples.
Kit for carrying out a method according to any of Claims 1 to 7, 
characterised in that
 it comprises, as separate
reagents, i) a known amount of a ligand derivative in the form of a thyroid hormone-immunoglobulin conjugate, ii)

a known amount of a labelled anti-ligand antibody and, if required, iii) standard solutions of the thyroid hormone
as ligand standard samples and iv) suitable buffer and dilution solutions as well as v) test tubes whose walls are

coated with an excess of an anti-idiotypical immunoglobulin against the immunoglobulin part of the ligand derivative.
Kit according to Claim 8, 
characterised in that
 it contains the ligand derivative, the labelled antibody if required
the ligand standard samples, and the coated test tubes all in freeze-dried form.
