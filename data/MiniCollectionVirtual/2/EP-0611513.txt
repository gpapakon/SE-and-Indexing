<ABSTRACT>
This apparatus (101) operates to discern temporal and spatial anomalies in the use of subscriber numbers in the cellular mobile telephone system, which anomalies are typically indicative of cloning of valid subscriber numbers. The detection of a bogus subscriber unit (B) is accomplished by recording the call origination and termination patterns associated with the subscriber number. The cloning detection apparatus (101) makes use of call origination data to identify concurrent call originations or receptions for a single subscriber number. Further analysis also includes a spatial analysis of successive call activity for a subscriber number. If two successive calls for a particular subscriber number are detected in a time interval that is too short to justify the geographic separation of the subscriber unit (B) for the two successive calls, then this apparatus identifies these two call connections as including one subscriber unit (B) having a cloned subscriber number.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to cellular mobile
telephone systems and, in particular, to apparatus
that detects attempts by an unauthorized user to clone
valid subscriber numbers and prevents the use of these
cloned numbers to originate unauthorized calls.It is a problem in the field of cellular mobile
telephone systems to prevent call initiations by
unauthorized users who attempt to fraudulently access
the cellular mobile telephone system. There are
numerous methods used to originate unauthorized calls
in cellular mobile telephone systems and many of these
methods are difficult to detect and prevent due to the
mobile nature of the subscriber station set. One
method of fraudulent access is the use of subscriber
number cloning to obtain unauthorized access to the
cellular mobile telephone system. Subscriber number
cloning is accomplished by an unauthorized user
programming a valid subscriber number into the
cellular telephone station set in order to deceive the
cellular mobile telephone system into providing call
services to the unauthorized user. Existing cellular 
mobile telephone systems can not distinguish between
valid and fraudulent subscriber numbers due to the
fact that the subscriber station sets are mobile and
are only identified to the cellular telephone system
by subscriber number and unit identification number.
Service can be denied to a fraudulent cloned
telephone number only when the fraud is detected and
the fraudulent unit distinguished from the valid
subscriber unit. Presently existing systems do not
provide adequate fraudulent unit detection and
service theft prevention capability.For example, according to a technique disclosed
in U.S. Patent No. 4,901,340, a roaming subscriber
may automatically receive, in a foreign service area
(that is, an area outside his home service area),
calls placed to his mobile identification number
(MID) at his home service area. This technique is
not concerned at all with calls originated from
subscriber units and, consequently, does not provide
any fraudulent unit detection and service theft
prevention capability. As another example, disclosed
in an article written by Kent R. Tracy and entitled
"IMTS-B - A New Look At Mobile Telephone Service," a
terminal denies services to one mobile number only if
the terminal finds that two mobile telephones with
the same number are attempting to use the terminal at
the same time. The above described problems are solved and a
technical advance achieved in the field by an
apparatus and a method according to Claims 1 and 9 for
