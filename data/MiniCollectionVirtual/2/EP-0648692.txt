<ABSTRACT>
A container which is prismatic in shape and in particular has a square outline, has a floor, a base frame (1) and side walls (2, 4, 7) rising from the latter, a front wall (7) being provided which is pivotably mounted so as to permit opening of the container and the container being further equipped with a pressing device (3, 8, 10) for compressing the material with which it is filled. The front wall (7) is fixedly connected on its underside to the floor (5) of the container and the unit formed in this manner is mounted on the front of the container so as to pivot outwards. The pressing device is composed of a pressing lid (3) and a knee lever device (8, 10) which is provided for pressing down the pressing lid (3) and is to be actuated by means of a hand lever (8).

<CLAIMS>
A container comprising a bottom (5), a base frame (1) and 
side walls (2, 4, 7) extending upwardly therefrom, a pivotably 

journalled front side wall (7) being provided for opening the 
container, and the container further comprising a pressing 

device for compressing the filling material which is equipped 
with a pressing lid (3) and lever means (8, 10) provided for 

pressing down the pressing lid and to be actuated by a hand 
lever (8),
 
characterized in that the front side wall (7) of the container, 

which has a prismatic shape, is rigidly connected on its lower 
side with the container bottom (5), and the unit thus formed by 

the front side wall (7) and the bottom (5) of the container is 
journalled in the container at its front side so as to be 

outwardly pivotable, in that the pressing lid (3) is journalled 
in the container at its side facing the rear side wall of the 

container to be pivotable about a horizontal axis, in that the 
hand lever (8) is pivotably journalled in the container in the 

region of the rear side wall (2), and in that the lever means 
(8, 10) further comprise a connecting rod (10) hinged to the 

hand lever (8) on the one hand and to the pressing lid (3) on 
the other. 
A container as set forth in claim 1, characterized in that 
the hand lever (8) can be pressed down to a dead center position 

of the lever means (10), in which position the section of the 
hand lever (8) between the journalling location (8a) of the hand 

lever (8) and the hinging location (10a) of the connecting rod 

(10) is in alignment with said connecting rod (10). 
A container as set forth in claims 1 or 2, characterized in 
that the hand lever (8) is angled in its longitudinal direction 

in the region of the hinging location (10a) of the connecting 
rod (10), with the concave side of the angle pointing upwards. 
A container as set forth in any one of claims 1 to 3, 
characterized in that the hand lever (8) is a U-shaped handle 

which is pivotably journalled at the ends of its two legs (8b), 
with a respective connecting rod (10) being hinged to each leg  

 
which leads to a hinging location (3a) positioned at the lateral 

edge of the pressing lid (3). 
A container as set forth in any one of claims 1 to 4, 
characterized in that a catch means (11) is mounted at the 

pressing lid (3) which catches the pressing lid (3) in the 
upright position thereof and keeps it from pivoting downward 

unintentionally. 
A container as set forth in any one of claims 1 to 5, 
characterized in that the front side wall (7), which is connected 

to the container bottom (5) and is forwardly pivotable out of 
the container, is pivotably journalled on the base frame at the 

front side of the base frame (1) of the container. 
A container as set forth in any one of claims 1 to 6, 
characterized in that the upper part of the front side wall (7) 

comprises forwardly projecting, preferably bow-shaped handling 
means (14) which form support legs when the front side wall (7) 

is pivoted outward, which support legs support the outwardly 
pivoted front side wall (7) at the site of the container. 
A container as set forth in any one of claims 1 to 7, 
characterized in that the upper part of the front side wall (7) 

comprises closing means which constitute a connection to the 
lateral side walls (4) and prevent unintentional pivoting during 

the pressing process. 
A container as set forth in any one of claims 1 to 8, 
characterized in that the pressing lid (3) is equipped with 

carrier means (17) for tying material.
