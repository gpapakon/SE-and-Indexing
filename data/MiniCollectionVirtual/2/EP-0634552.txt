<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a lock with a pivoting bolt rotating about a fixed point, especially as an additional lock (4) on espagnolette locks (1), in which lock the movement of the pivoting bolt (27) is achieved as a result of the engagement of a taken-up driver (46) into a recess (37) which forms a plurality of interconnected portions arranged at an angle to one another, for the purpose of driving the pivoting bolt (27) on the one hand, and a non-return position of the latter, on the other hand, and, for the purpose of achieving an optimum locking mode, proposes that the recess (37) provided in the pivoting bolt (27) be designed as a window (F) with a niche (42) directed radially towards the fixed point from one window corner, and that the window ledges (39, 40) adjoining the niche sidewalls (43, 44) be designed as blocking portions, in front of which the driver (46) is located in the end positions of its movement.

Lock with a pivot catch (27) rotating about a fixed 
point, in particular as an additional lock on driving rod 

locks, in which movement of the pivot catch is obtained by 
engagement of an entrained driver (46) in a recess (37), 

which recess forms several sections connected to each other 
and at an angle to each other for the purpose of 

entrainment of the pivot catch on the one hand and a return 
lock position thereof on the other hand, characterised in 

that the recess (37) provided in the pivot catch (27) is 
designed as an aperture (F) with a notch (42) oriented from 

one corner of the aperture radially towards the fixed 
point, and the sides (39, 40) of the aperture adjoining the 

side walls (43, 44) of the notch are designed as locking 
sections in front of which the driver (46) is located in 

the end positions of its movement. 
Lock according to claim 1, characterised in that the 
path of movement of the flank (47) of the driver (46) on 

the side of the fixed point is located almost tangentially 
to the pin (26) mounted in the fixed point. 
Lock according to one or more of the preceding claims, 
characterised in that from the broadside faces (29) of the 

pivot catch (27) extend facets (31) which encompass the 
mouth (28) of the pivot catch on the outside and slope down 

only to the apex (30) of the pivot catch, and which slope 
down evenly to the circumferential edge (32). 
Lock according to one or more of the preceding claims, 
characterised in that the driver (46) is cambered at its 

flank (52) which advances the pivot catch (27). 
Lock according to one or more of the preceding claims, 
characterised in that the driver (46) in the advanced 

position of the pivot catch (27) enters one aperture  
 

opening section (A) in form-locking relationship by two 
flanks (47, 51) located parallel to each other and to its 

direction of movement.
