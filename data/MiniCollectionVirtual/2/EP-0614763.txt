<ABSTRACT>
An automatic platen gap adjusting apparatus is provided with a 
stepping motor (5) for moving a carriage (1) loaded with a 

recording head (2) in the vertical direction of a platen (4), a 
rotary encoder (12) for producing a plurality of pulse signals 

proportional to the rotational speed of the motor, the rotary 
encoder being equipped with a detection mark on its 

circumference, a time difference integrating device for 
obtaining the integrated value of the time difference between 

the pulse signal from the rotary encoder and the driving pulse 
of the stepping motor (5) by moving the carrier (1) from a 

reference position in the direction of the platen (4), and an 
abutment decision device for detecting whether the value thus 

obtained has reached a predetermined value. The thickness of 
the paper is calculated by a paper thickness calculation device 

according to the number of pulses produced up to a point of 
time the signal is produced from the abutment decision device. 

The apparatus of the present invention can automatically adjust 
the relative gap (G) between the platen (4) and the recording 

head (1) with precision while preventing press marks from 
appearing on the paper as much as possible because the paper is 

caused to abut against the carriage.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an apparatus for
automatically adjusting the gap between a platen and a printing
head in proportion to the corresponding thickness of recording
paper.With recording heads, in order to effect high-speed printing,
the distance between a platen and the printing head should be
as small as possible. This applies particularly to wire dot
recording heads for use in printing characters by striking
wires against recording paper via ink ribbons, where the
striking stroke of the wire have to be set as small as
possible.On the other hand, it is desirable that many kinds of
recording paper are printable, leading to the need that the
distance between the recording head and recording paper tends
to vary to a greater extent. This applies especially to
mechanically strong recording heads of the wire dot type which
render it possible to make copies with the aid of a copying
material.For this reason, especially printers using a wire dot recording
head have been provided with a mechanism of
adjusting the relative gap between the platen and the recording
head. However, the problem is that the work of selecting the
optimum gap for specific recording paper requires a great deal
of skill and is also troublesome.In order to solve the problem above, Examined Japanese
Patent Publication No. Hei. 4-14634, for instance, discloses a 
printer providing an encoder for producing pulse signals
corresponding to the movement of a carriage from the initial
position and a control unit for processing feedback pulse
signals from the encoder. In this case, when a recording head
abuts against recording paper, the fact that a pulse motor for
driving the carriage starts stepping out is detected from
variations of the number of pulses from the encoder, whereby
the thickness of the recording paper is obtained from the
movement of the carriage up to the abutment point of time, so
that the carriage position is made controllable according to
the data thus obtained.Notwithstanding, there still arises a problem in that, since
the recording head is forced to abut against the recording
paper until the pulse motor starts to step out, recording paper
such as copying paper which colors in response to external
force may bear press marks.Prior art document PATENT ABSTRACT OF JAPAN JP-A-03 169 665
