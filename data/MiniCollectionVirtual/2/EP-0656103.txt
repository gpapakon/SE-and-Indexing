<ABSTRACT>
In a preferred embodiment, the joint device consists of two joint components made of a flexible and resilient material and each provided with a pair of flexible flanges (4) fastened to the conveyor belt (6) by rivets (10). A reinforcement (5) extends through the flanges (4) and the portion of the joint device which forms the actual joint, and is secured to rings (7) or tabs (8) for strengthening the fastening holes. A link rod extends through channels in the linking members.

Joining device for conveyor belt, made up of two halves joining
devices, each one of these halves joining devices presenting on one of its

internal edges a series of linking elements arranged for receiving a
linking stem (3) or linking stems, threaded across transversally,

alternatively in one linking element (1) belonging to one half joining
device; then in one linking element (1) belonging to the other joining

device, and so on, the half joining devices having been brought close to
each other in such a way as to interleave the linking elements (1)

belonging to one of the half joining device with the linking elements (1),
belonging to the other half joining device, and presenting on its other

external edge a pair of flexible fastening arms (4), arranged in such a
way as to allow the insertion between these arms and end of the

conveyor belt, the said arms (4) being solidly attached to the part of the
half joining element which carries the linking elements (1) on its

opposite side, the said half joining devices being made of a flexible and
elastic material and comprising an internal reinforcement (5) embedded

in a flexible and elastic material, the said internal reinforcement (5)
extends in a first fastening arm (4), surrounds over approximately 180Â°

the hollow parts (2) of the linking elements (1) used as passage to the
linking stems, at a certain distance of the surface of this latter, or flush

levelled with the said surface, then extends in the other fastening arm
(4), characterised by the fact that the internal reinforcement (5) is of

same range of flexibility and elasticity than those of the said material.
Joining device according to claim 1, characterised by the fact
that the flexible fastening arms (4) comprise fastening holes for the

fastening arms, which are lined by washers, or by sockets (7) or by
small drilled plates (8) incorporated into the arms.
Joining device according to claim 2, characterised by the fact
that the reinforcement (5) is trimmed to the washers (7) or to the

sockets or small plates (8).
Joining device according to claim 3, characterised by the fact
that at the ends of the arms (4) small protective plates (8) are

incorporated into the arms, the edges of the said small plates (8)
forming a bevelled bent down rim, to meet the arms surface located

opposite to the surface of the end of the conveyor belt. 
Joining device according to anyone of the preceding claims,
characterised by the fact that the reinfo
rcement is made up of a knitted
fabric.
Joining device according to claim 1 comprising a woven
reinforcement, characterised by the fact that the fabric which makes up

the reinforcement comprises warp threads (11) made up of one or
several internal threads (12) embedded in an elastic material, the weft

threads (13) presenting longitudinally a certain elasticity and being
woven loosewise, and loosened with respect to the warp threads, the

reinforcement fabric being used in a way such as the weft threads are
arranged in the longitudinal direction, with respect to the joining

devices.
Joining device according to claim 1, characterised by the fact
that the linking stem (3) or the linking stems (3) are reinforced by

means of a wrapping canvas.
Joining device according to claim 3, characterised by the fact
that the trimming is obtained, thanks to holes provided in the knitted,

woven or unwoven reinforcement, washers or sockets being engaged in
the said holes provided in the reinforcement.
