<ABSTRACT>
The present invention is a tubular structure (11) which inflates upon side or oblique vehicle impact to protect the occupants of a vehicle such as an automobile. The structure is mounted in its undeployed state along the periphery of the vehicle's side pillars (20, 21) and roof rail (23). The primary component of the present invention is a braided tube (15) linked to a gas generator (22). When a side impact is detected, the gas generator (22) is ignited, inflating the braided tube (15). As the braided tube (15) inflates, the diameter of the tube (15) increases and its length decreases. The tube (15) then pulls out of its storage location and forms a taut, semi-rigid structural member across the vehicle's side window (24).

<DESCRIPTION>
This application is a continuation-in-part
of U.S. Application Serial No. 08/019,655, filed on
February 19, 1993, which is incorporated by reference
herein.The present invention relates to safety
apparatus for protecting the occupant of a motor
vehicle from injuries that could be sustained during a
side impact or roll over crash. More specifically, it
relates to a system of components that inflate to
protect and/or cushion the head and neck from direct
impact with the interior vehicle structure or exterior
structure of the impact object. Patent No. Fr 2442058 (Clausin) on which the preamble of claim 1 is
based, discloses
a system for protecting occupants from frontal impacts,
and comprises a braided tube that is attached to a
safety belt. Side or lateral impacts are a leading cause
of injuries and fatalities in automotive crashes.
According to the Insurance Institute for Highway
Safety (IIHS), 30 percent of all automobile occupant
fatalities in the United States in 1989 involved side
impact crashes.Occupants killed in side impact crashes
typically have a high incidence of head and neck
injuries. Side impact crashes also cause severe
injuries to other body regions including the chest,
abdomen, pelvis and extremities. Figure 1 summarizes
the distribution of injuries by body region, based on 
an IIHS study of 91 struck-side and 49 opposite-side
fatalities in the United Kingdom in 1985. Figure 1
shows the distribution of injuries having a severity
greater than or equal to three on the Abbreviated
Injury Scale (AIS) by body region for fatalities in
struck-side and opposite-side crashes. "Struck-side"
refers to occupants seated on the side of the vehicle
that was struck, while "opposite-side" refers to
occupants who were seated on the side that was not
struck. According to the IIHS study, 64% of struck-side
occupants suffered head injuries; 12% suffered
neck injuries; 85% suffered chest injuries; 26%
suffered pelvis injuries; 2% suffered injuries to
their upper limbs and 21% to their lower limbs; and
59% suffered abdomen injuries. Figure 1 also shows
that 82% of opposite-side occupants suffered head
injuries; 20% suffered neck injuries; 73% suffered
chest injuries; 14% suffered pelvis injuries; 10%
suffered injuries to their upper limbs and 12%
suffered injuries to their lower limbs; and 49%
suffered abdomen injuries. Figure 1 shows that
serious head and neck injuries can occur in either
seating position.Conventional automotive safety belt and air
bag systems offer inadequate protection to the head
and neck

<CLAIMS>
A safety system for protesting occupants of
vehicles comprising:


(a) a braided tube (15) comprising an inner bladder
(25; 26) running the length of the tube, said tube having

a first end, a second end, and an inner surface;

said tube being mounted proximate to said first end
at a first position in the vehicle (18);
said tube being mounted proximate to said second end
at a second position in the vehicle (19);
(b) means for generating gas flow (22) into said
inner bladder, thereby inflating the tube; and
(c) crash sensor means connected to said means for
generating gas flow, said crash sensor means being

capable of initiating generation of gas flow into said
inner bladder (25; 26) upon detection of an impact,

wherein, upon inflation of said inner bladder (25;
26), said tube (15) increases its diameter and decreases

its length substantially such that said tube deploys
under tension in a substantially straight line between

the first and second positions (18, 19) in the vehicle,

characterized in that the first and second positions
(18, 19) are such that, in the deployed state, the tube

spans a side window opening of the vehicle.
A safety system as claimed in claim 1, wherein
said tube in its uninflated state is substantially longer

than the straight-line distance between said first and
second positions in the vehicle.
A safety system as claimed in claim 1 or 2,
wherein the diameter of said inner bladder is larger than

the diameter of said braided tube such that said inner
bladder is only partially inflated when said braided tube

is fully deployed.
A safety system as claimed in any preceding
claim, wherein said inner bladder is comprised of a gas-retentive

material. 
A safety system as claimed in any preceding
claim, wherein said inner bladder is comprised of an
