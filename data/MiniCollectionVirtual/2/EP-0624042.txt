<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to an improvement of a television signal of a new
standard, which includes a first signal component representing a picture having
usual vertical resolution of a conventional television standard such as, for
instance, PAL standard, which signal can be reproduced by a television receiver
for the conventional standard, a second signal component to be utilized in
video equipments for the new television standard such as video cassette
recorders or television receivers so as to improve the vertical resolution of
the picture recorded or reproduced thereby, and an information data signal for
controlling video equipments for the conventional or new television standard.
The invention further relates to a method of transmitting such the improved new
standard television signal and to a video equipment for processing the improved
new standard television signal.So-called "PAL PLUS" system is being developed. The proposed PAL PLUS system are
described in the following articles: "Der Weg zu PAL-plus - Eine kompatible

signal representing a studio picture source of a wide aspect ratio 16:9 having
the active 575 lines per frame is separated by vertical filtering to perform a
line down conversion of 3/4 into a first picture component signal (luminance
and chrominance) providing a usual vertical resolution of a picture which is
displayed in a letter box size by 430 lines in a television screen of a normal
aspect ratio 4:3 and by vertical filtering to perform a line down conversion of
1/4 into a second picture component signal (luminance only)
