Deflection device for a colour cathode-ray tube
with three coplanar guns, comprising a pair of

horizontal deflection coils and a pair of vertical
deflection coils, each horizontal deflection coil

including a main deflection winding (21) extending over
the length of the deflection device and an auxiliary

deflection winding (122) arranged in the front part of
the main coil and fed in such a way as to generate a

magnetic field (31) opposed to the field of this main
coil in the front part of each of the coils of the said

pair of horizontal deflection coils, the third-order
harmonic of the Fourier-series decomposition of the

angular distribution of the ampere-turn density being
substantially equal to or greater than that of the

fundamental, characterized in that the conductors (24)
of the said auxiliary winding (22) are arranged

laterally around a mean angle (2M) relative to the
horizontal deflection axis, this mean angle varying as

a function of the position of the said conductors along
the longitudinal axis (2) of the deflection device in

such a way as to reduce the amplitude of the 5th
harmonic of the Fourier series decomposition of the

angular distribution of the ampere-turn density created
by the said main deflection winding.
Deflection device according to Claim 1,
characterized in that the said mean angle (2M) is

between 55째 and 65째. 
Deflection device according to Claim 2,
characterized in that the value of the said mean angle

(2M) around which the conductors of the auxiliary
winding (22) are arranged increases in proportion to

the distance from the front part of this winding.
Deflection device according to any one of the
preceding claims, characterized in that the majority of

the said conductors (24) of the said auxiliary winding
are arranged laterally in an angular position lying

between 54째 and 90째.
Deflection device according to any one of the
preceding claims, characterized in that a part of the

conductors (23) of the main winding (21), situated in

the mid-part of this winding is offset inwards on the
winding.
Deflection device according to any one of the
preceding claims, characterized in that the said

conductors (24) of the said auxiliary coil (22) are
short-circuited with themselves.
Cathode-ray tube characterized in that it is
equipped with a deflection device in accordance with

any one of the preceding claims.
