<ABSTRACT>
A compact image karaoke device with only a small 
number of image disks which provides the impression of having 

a great many background images. Two players are provided for 
reading background images from image disks. Background 

images read by the two players are changed at random, for 
example, every 30 seconds. By editing the display of 

background images in this manner, a great number of 
background image series can be obtained from combinations of 

the background images. Images obtained and displayed 
corresponding particularly to the starting portion of the 

song are provided only in the number of images. Therefore, 
even if a great number of songs are consecutively selected, 

a user will not feel as though the same images are being 
repeatedly shown.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an image karaoke 
device which plays accompaniment music of a song to be sung 
while displaying the lyrics of the song and a background 
image behind the display of the lyrics. Previously, there has been known an image karaoke 
device which reproduces, from a video disk, image, lyric, and 
music data for each song desired to be sung. Because data 
for several thousand songs must be stored in each device, an 
establishment which provides an image karaoke device for its 
customers must keep an extremely large number of video disks 
on hand. A special video disk housing case is provided to 
the image karaoke device for housing several video disks. An 
autochanger is provided for changing the video disks 
according to a request by a karaoke user. The space taken up 
by the autochanger and the special housing case has given 
rise to a need for a more compact device, especially in 
establishments that provide karaoke for customers. United States Patent No.5,233,438 has proposed a more 
compact device for solving the above problem, wherein image 
data is stored separately from song data. A background image 
formed based on the image data is displayed while the song is  
 
played and the lyrics displayed. The image data which 
becomes the background image is often stored in video disks. 
Generally two types of image data are stored on each video 
disk. For example, when one video disk contains two hours of 
image data, one hour of image data could be devoted to 
Japanese ballads (i.e., Japanese "enka") and one hour could 
be devoted to popular songs. Stated in further detail, a plurality of images, 
corresponding to either Japanese ballads or popular songs, 
are stored in approximately four minute segments. Image data 
for images is retrieved in the order stored. For example, 
when a user requests two Japanese ballads, then a popular 
song, a Japanese ballad, and a popular song in that order, 
first, the first and second sets of image data for Japanese 
ballads will be retrieved one after the other, then the first 
set of image data for popular songs, then the third set of 
image data for Japanese ballads, and finally the second set 
of image data for popular songs will be retrieved in that 
order. However, with the example described above, since one 
song is about four minutes long, image data sufficient for 
only 14 to 15 Japanese ballads and the same number of popular 
songs is provided. Therefore, a person singing frequently 
will possibly tire of seeing the same background
