<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to grease compositions. More particularly, it relates
to metal soap thickened base greases having dropping points as measured by
ASTM Procedure D-2265 increased by adding certain components described in
detail hereinbelow.Man's need to reduce friction dates back to ancient times. As far back as
1400 B.C., both mutton fat and beef fat (tallow) were used in attempting to
reduce axle friction in chariots.Until the mid-1800's, lubricants continued to be primarily mutton and beef
fats, with certain types of vegetable oils playing minor roles. In 1859, however,
Colonel Drake drilled his first oil well. Since that time most lubricants, including
greases, have been based on petroleum ("mineral") oil, although synthetic oil
based lubricants are used for special applications.In the NLGI Lubricating Grease Guide, C 1987, available from the National
Lubricating Grease Institute, Kansas City, Missouri, USA, is a detailed discussion 
of greases, including various types of thickeners. Such thickeners include
simple
metal soap, complex metal salt-metal soap and non-soap thickened greases.Simple metal soap thickened greases have provided exemplary
performance. However, under certain conditions an increased dropping point as
measured by ASTM Procedure D-2265 is required.One way to increase the dropping point of base greases is to convert a
simple metal soap grease to a complex grease by incorporating therein certain
acids, typically carboxylic acids such as acetic acid, alpha-omega-dicarboxylic
acids and certain aromatic acids. This process necessarily consumes considerable
time resulting in reduced production. Nevertheless, complex greases provide
highly desirable properties and are widely used. Oftentimes complexing does not
take place and the grease retains substantially the properties of the corresponding
simple soap grease. Such greases are referred to herein as failed complex greases.
Reasons for failure to achieve complex formation are not well understood.Doner et al, in a series of US Patents, specifically, US Patents
5,084,1945,068,0454,961,8684,828,7344,828,7324,781,8504,780,2274,743,3864,655,9484,600,5174,582,617
teaches increased thickening of metal salt thickened base greases is obtained
employing a wide variety of boron-containing compounds. Other additives
contemplated for use with boron-containing compounds are phosphorus- and
sulfur-containing materials, particularly zinc dithiophosphates.Reaction products of 0,0-dihydrocarbyl-phosphorodithioic acids with
epoxides are described by
