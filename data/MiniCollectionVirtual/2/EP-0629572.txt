<ABSTRACT>
Actuation is by a pressure-operated diaphragm (1), acting in the axial direction against the top end faces (2) of the inserts. The diaphragm can be secured to the housing by a sleeve (4), inside which is a distance-plate (6) via which the diaphragm acts against the inserts. The plate thickness can be less by a set amount than that of the sleeve. Each insert can be contained in a cup-shaped piston movable in the axial direction, and whose free edge (10) in the rest position is roughly level with the point at which the insert folds inwards.

Gripper device for bottles or the like with a plurality 
of grab arms which have a housing (5) with a receiving 

aperture (15) for the bottle (7) to be gripped as well 
as a resilient grab arm insert (3) disposed in the 

receiving aperture on the perimeter, which insert, 
through the operation of an actuating device, engages 

in an essentially radial direction in the receiving 
aperture (15) in order to grip the bottle (7),
characterised in that
 
the actuating device contains a pressure-responsive 

membrane (1) which acts in an axial direction on the 
upper front surface (2) of the grab arm insert (3). 
Gripper device according to claim 1,
characterised in that
 
the membrane (1) is fastened to the grab arm housing 

(5) by a fastening collar (4). 
Gripper device according to claim 2,
characterised in that
 
inside the collar (4) a distance plate (6) is arranged 

by means of which the membrane (1) acts on the front 
surface (2) of the grab arm insert (3). 
Gripper device according to claim 3,
characterised in that
  
 

the height of the distance plate (6) is lower than that 
of the fastening collar (4) by a defined residual 

clearance. 
Gripper device according to one of claims 1 to 4,
characterised in that
 
the grab arm insert (3) is partially contained in a 

hemispherical piston (9) which can be moved axially and 
whose free edge (10), when the gripper device is non-operative, 

is located approximately at the height of a 
bending perimeter of the grab arm insert (3). 
Gripper device according to claim 5,
characterised in that
 
the free edge (10) has a circumferential bead (11) 

directed radially inwards. 
Gripper device according to claim 5 or 6,
characterised in that
 
the hemispherical piston (9) has a rotating inner 

base (12) to which the grab arm insert (3) adjoins with 
its lower front edge (13). 
Gripper device according to one of the preceding 
claims, in which the grab arm housings (5) are designed 

in a block as one piece in a number corresponding to 
the number of bottles (7) to be gripped simultaneously, 

and the grab arm inserts (3) of all grab arms (5) are  
 

impinged on together with the necessary force for 
gripping the bottles,
characterised in that
 
the block (8) forms a lower portion of the gripper 

device on which a cover-like upper portion (17) sits, 
and that the membrane (1) is fastened to the inner side 

of the upper portion (17) and acts on the grab arm 
inserts (3) by means of a plate (18) which can be moved 

in an axial direction. 
Gripper device according to one of the preceding 
claims, with a grab arm insert (3) which has a 

plurality of breaks (14) distributed over the 
perimeter,
characterised in that
 
the breaks (14) are separated from the interior of the 

grab arm insert (3) by means of a protective layer 
(16). 
Gripper device according to claim 9,
characterised in that
 
the protective layer (16) is designed as of one piece 

with the grab arm insert (3).
