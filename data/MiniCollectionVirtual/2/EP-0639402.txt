<ABSTRACT>
An ordered packing 10 comprises elongate elements 12, 14, 16 and 18 having 
lengthwise extending surfaces configured to be wetted by a liquid phase thereby 

to form a liquid film thereon. The elongate elements are packed together into a 
structure such that in each of a plurality of parallel planes, extending in two 

orthogonal directions, the elongate elements cross one another to form lattices 
having openings defined between the crossings of the elements. The elongate 

elements are interleaved within the structure such that elongate elements pass 
through the openings in the lattices and form repeating clusters of four of the 

elongate element in a pyramid-like arrangement. Each of the clusters of the 
elongate elements and their lengthwise extending surfaces provide pathways for 

the film to descend through the structure. The structure has an open area for a 
vapour phase to ascend through the structure and contact the liquid phase.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an ordered packing to contact intimately vapour
and liquid phases ascending and descending within a column.The prior art has provided liquid-gas mass transfer elements within columns or
towers to bring ascending and descending vapour and liquid phases into
intimate contact in distillation and absorption processes. Common liquid-gas
mass transfer elements are sieve trays, plates and packing elements. Packing
elements can be random or dumped such as the well known Raschig rings or
can have a fixed or ordered structure relative to the column axes. The latter
packings include structured packings, which consist of parallel metal or woven
gauze sheets that can be crimped in a herringbone or sinusoidal pattern. Each
of the sheets can also have an embossment. The sheets are assembled face to
face so that the directions of the crimpings cross one another to provide
alternative pathways for the vapour to ascend and the liquid to descend through
the packing in a countercurrent direction to one another. Perforations can be
provided within the sheets to permit mass transfer in a direction normal to the
sheets.In structured packings formed by vertically arranged sheets, as the liquid
descends through the packing, it will, by and large, spread out along two
opposite directions parallel to the sheets. Therefore, liquid flow in a direction
normal to the sheets will be inhibited. The perforations provided in the sheets
permit some liquid migration in a direction normal to the sheets, however, such
perforations only make up less than 10% of the area provided by the sheets and
hence, such migration is limited.A further problem related to the use of any structured packing concerns the
possibility of deformation of the packing due to shocks and vibrations attendant
upon the transportation of a column containing structured packing to an erection 
site. It is this possibility of packing deformation which can limit the size of
factory built packings.The packing is normally installed in a column or tower in segments, each
segment filling the diameter of the column or tower and consisting of packing
material of identical orientation bounded by horizontal planes spaced apart by
six or more inches. In the usual arrangement, each segment is rotated 90°
about its vertical axis in relation to the segments above and below, placing the
vertical planes of the sheets in the adjacent segments.As will be discussed, the present invention provides an ordered packing that
inherently provides a more uniform

<CLAIMS>
An ordered packing for intimately contacting a vapour phase with a liquid
phase, said ordered packing comprising:


a plurality of elongate elements, each of the elongate elements having at
least one elongate surface configured to be wetted by the liquid phase

and thereby form a film of the liquid phase on the said elongate surface;
the plurality of elongate elements being packed to form a structure such
that in each of a plurality of parallel planes, extending in two orthogonal

directions, the elongate elements cross one another to form lattices
having openings defined between the crossings of the elements;
the plurality of elongate elements being interleaved within said structure
such that elongate elements pass through the openings of the lattices and

form repeating clusters of four of the elongate elements in a pyramid-like
arrangement, thereby to provide by each of said clusters and the said

elongate surface of each of the elongate elements thereof, at least four
pathways for the liquid phase to descend through the structure; and
the structure having an open area for the vapour phase to ascend through
the structure and contact the descending liquid phase.
An ordered packing according to Claim 1, wherein the elongate elements
cross one another at an angle of about 90°.
An ordered packing according to Claim 1 or claim 2, wherein each of the
elongate elements is formed by an L-shaped channel.
An ordered packing according to claim 3, wherein the elongate elements 
at their crossings contact one another along two parallel edges thereof.
An ordered packing according to any one of claims 1 to 4, in which the
packing comprises first and second sets of parallel lattices, the first set

being disposed at such an angle to the second set and the lattices of the
two sets so intersecting one another as to define said clusters.
