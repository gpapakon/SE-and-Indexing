<ABSTRACT>
A skin treatment composition comprises an organic acid such as an alphahydroxy acid, a halo-carboxylic acid or a dicarboxylic acid together with 0.1-10 % of a limonene based oil in an inert carrier. Also disclosed is a delivery system for acidic skin treatments, comprising a body of bibulous material (12) having the composition absorbed thereupon, and a moisture proof package (14) which retains the body of bibulous material (12).

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to dermatologic
compositions in general. Specifically, the invention
relates to dermatologic compositions which include an
acidic material and a limonene based oil. The invention
also relates to a packaged delivery system for acidic
dermatologic compositions.Certain organic acids have an extensive history
of use in connection with the treatment of skin conditions.
Sour milk contains lactic acid and a variety of fruit
juices contain glycolic acid. Both of these acids are
alphahydroxy carboxylic acids and a variety of compositions
based upon fruit juice or soured milk have long been
documented as being beneficial for the skin. Similarly,
polycarboxylic acids such as citric acid, which is present
in many fruits and tartaric acid, which is present in wine
residues, have also long been used as skin treatments.
More recently, halo-carboxylic acids, primarily
trichloracetic acid, have been found to be beneficial as
skin treatment agents. These acidic materials, when
properly applied, have been found to soften, moisturize and
tone the skin, bleach unwanted pigmentation, reduce
wrinkles and ameliorate conditions such as
pseudofolliculitis barbae, keratoses. A variety of compositions incorporating the
aforementioned acidic materials have been known for some
time in the prior art, and U.S. Patent Nos. 3,897,537;
3,984,566; 3,988,470 are representative of compositions
including such acidic materials. However, it has come to
be found that use of the free acids can actually irritate
the skin, producing an uncomfortable burning sensation, red
spots, and temporary hyperpigmentation. Furthermore, the
free acids tend to crystallize out of various preparations
thereby limiting their shelf life and further exacerbating
the problem of irritation.In response to problems associated with the use
of free acids, the prior art turned to compositions
including neutralized acids therein. The neutralization is
typically accomplished by the use of inorganic bases such
as sodium hydroxide, potassium hydroxide or ammonium
hydroxide, which react with the acids to form salts. U.S.
Patent Nos. 4,021,572; 4,105,783; and 4,234,599 are
representative of the prior art relating to neutralized
compositions. In general, it has been found that
neutralization does prevent the irritating effects
encountered in the use of acid containing preparations;
however, it has also been found that the neutralized
products are ineffective insofar as they do not rejuvenate,
tone or bleach the skin. U.S. Patent No. 5,091,171
contains a
