<ABSTRACT>
A small-sized diaphragm device (10;30;52) for an image pickup lens system 
having an electrochromic element (11;31;53) the light transmitting properties of 

which are changed on application of an electrical voltage. The diaphragm device 
also includes a first set of plural concentrically arranged transparent electrodes 

(14a-14d;34a-34d;54), a second set of plural concentrically arranged transparent 
electrodes (15a-15d;35a-35d;55) and third electrodes (16A,16B;36A,36B;56) 

formed on the outer most peripheries of these sets of transparent electrodes for 
acting as counter-electrodes for the transparent electrodes. The diaphragm device 

has a sufficient light transmittance when in the transparent state, while having high 
light interrupting properties when in the light interrupting state.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a diaphragm device for an image pickup lens system 
which is provided with an electrochromic element having its light passing 
properties changed on application of an electric voltage, and in which the volume 
of light transmission may be controlled by the light passing properties of the 
electrochromic element. In a well-known manner, an electrochromic element exhibits different light 
transmitting properties between its oxidized state and its reduced state as a result of 
an electrochemical reaction. The electrochromic element is used for controlling 
the volume of light transmission of the incident light thereon by taking advantage 
of the difference in the light passing properties thereof. The electrochromic 
element comprises a thin film formed of an electrochromic material, such as WO3 
or WOD3, placed in contact with an electrolyte, such as a film-shaped lithium 
electrode. If the electrical voltage is forced in a direction in which the electrolyte 
side becomes a positive side, the state of the element is changed. In the case of a colorless WO3 thin film, for example, if the negative voltage is 
applied thereto, Mx + WO3ex- are formed by injection of electrons and positive 
ions in the electrolyte, with the thin film being changed from the colorless state 
into the state presenting a blue color. Consequently, if plural electrochromic 
elements presenting different colors in different wavelength regions are placed one 
on the other for taking advantage of the electric and light passing properties 
thereof, it becomes possible to control the volume of light transmission for the 
entire range of the visible light. There has hitherto been proposed a diaphragm device for an image pickup lens 
system, such as a camera, which takes advantage of the above-mentioned 
electrical and light transmitting properties of the electrochromic elements, in e.g. 
JP Patent Kokai (Laid-Open) Publication No.62-198835, entitled "Diaphragm 
Device". The diaphragm device according to the prior-art Publication has an 
electrochromic element 2 sandwiched and enclosed between a pair of transparent 
substrates 4A, 4B, along with an electrolyte, by means of a spacer 3, and a first set 
of transparent electrodes 5 and a second transparent electrode 6, mounted within 
the interior of the transparent substrates 4A and 4B in contact with the front and 
reverse surfaces of the electrochromic element 2, as shown in Figs.7 and 8.  
 At least the first set of transparent electrodes 5 are made up of plural 
co
