<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention provides a cyclic hexapeptide or
a salt thereof, a method of its production, and an
endothelin receptor antagonist containing said cyclic
hexapeptide or a pharmacologically acceptable salt thereof.Endothelin (ET), a vasoconstrictive peptide comprising
21 amino acids, is isolated from the culture supernatant of
the endothelial cells of porcine aortas and structurally
determined by Yanagisawa et al. in 1988 [Yanagisawa et al.,
Nature, Vol. 332, pp. 411-412]. Research into endothelin-encoding
genes has demonstrated that endothelin occurs in 3
structurally similar peptides, designated endothelin-1 (ET-1),
endothelin-2 (ET-2) and endothelin-3 (ET-3),
respectively.On the other hand, two types of endothelin receptors
are known: endothelin A receptors, which show higher
affinity for ET-1 and ET-2 than for ET-3, and endothelin B
receptors, which show equivalent affinity for ET-1, ET-2
and ET-3. In the part, endothelin A receptors were thought
to be present in vascular smooth muscle and to induce
smooth muscle contractions, endothelin B receptors to be
present in vascular endothelial cells and to induce smooth
muscle relaxation. In recent years, however, endothelin B
receptors have been shown to be involved in vascular smooth
muscle contractions as well [Biochemical and Biophysical
Research Communications, Vol. 175(2), 556-561 (1991);
Journal of Cardiovascular Pharmacology, Vol. 20 (Suppl.
12), S11-S14 (1992)]. There is therefore a need for the
development of endothelin B receptor antagonists, as well
as endothelin A receptor antagonists.Since the development of endothelin, there have been
intensive investigations in search of compounds that
antagonize endothelin receptors, with the aim of developing
therapeutic agents for diseases caused by endothelin. For 
example, cyclic peptides showing endothelin receptor
antagonistic action are disclosed in EP0436189A1 and
EP0528312A2. The cyclic peptide of Japanese Patent
Unexamined Publication No. 261198/1992, in particular, is
known to be very low in affinity for endothelin B
receptors, though it has affinity for endothelin A
receptors. The compound disclosed in Japanese Patent
Unexamined Publication No. 261198/1992 is therefore faulty
in that vascular smooth muscle contractions mediated by
endothelin B receptors are not suppressed satisfactorily,
though it suppresses vascular smooth muscle contractions
mediated by endothelin A receptors. On the other hand, the
compound disclosed in EP0528312A2 is known to be an
excellent endothelin receptor
