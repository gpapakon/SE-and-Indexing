<ABSTRACT>
A wireless telephone set comprise control means (15a) for 
controlling the transmission and the reception of signals, 

and a power switch (17) for controlling the supply of a 
power to the control means. The power switch (17) is turned 

ON to supply the power to the control means (15a) in response 
to each of frame signals, and is turned OFF when the 

wireless telephone set is in a waiting state for waiting an 
arriving call directed to the wireless telephone set, 

thereby the power consumption in the control means (15a) is 
reduced.

wireless telephone set. In the figure, reference numeral 1 is an
antenna for transmitting and receiving electromagnetic wave, and
2 is a duplexer for distributing transmitting high frequency
signals to the antenna 1 and for coupling receiving high
frequency signals from the antenna 1. Reference numeral 3 is a
transmitter for converting a voice electric signal into the
afore-mentioned transmitting high frequency signal, and 4 is a
microphone for converting a voice into the above-mentioned voice
electric signal. Reference numeral 5 is a receiver for
converting the above-mentioned high frequency signal into a
voice electric signal, and 6 is a speaker for converting the
voice electric signal into a voice. Reference numeral 7 is a
transmitter-side power switch for turning ON or OFF of the power
supplied to the above-mentioned transmitter 3, and 8 is a
receiver-side power switch for turning ON or OFF of the power
supplied to the above-mentioned receiver 5. Reference numeral 9
is a battery for supplying a power to the whole of this wireless 
telephone set, and 10 is a main switch for turning ON or OFF of
the supply of the power from the battery 9. The above-mentioned
transmitting-side power switch 7 and the receiving-side power
switch 8 are connected through this main switch 10 to the battery
9.Further, reference numeral 11 is a reference signal
oscillator which directly receives the power supplied from the
battery 9 through the main switch 10 to oscillate to generate a
reference signal, and 12 is a frequency dividing circuit for
dividing the reference signal generated by the reference
oscillator 11 to output frame pulses. Reference numeral 13 is a
timing generating circuit for controlling the timing of the
transmission and the reception by controlling the above-mentioned
transmitter 3, the receiver 4, the transmitting-side
power switch 7, the receiving-side power switch 8, and so forth,
and 14 is a timing circuit power switch, connected to the battery
9 through the main switch 10, for turning ON or OFF of the power
supplied to the timing generating circuit 13. Reference numeral
15 is a microprocessor as a control circuit for controlling the
frequency dividing circuit 12, the timing generating circuit 13,
the timing circuit power switch 14 and so forth, based on the
frame pulses outputted from the
