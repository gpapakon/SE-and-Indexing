<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to semiconductor
devices and fabrication methods thereof, and more
particularly to semiconductor devices wherein the
connection of semiconductor device with the wiring is
improved and to fabrication methods thereof.In recent years, as the higher integration of
semiconductor devices has been made, the area of each
part within a chip has been reduced, wherein it is an
important problem to reduce the area of the wiring part
because it occupies a large percentage of chip area.
Concerning the lead-out part to the wiring of semi-conductor
device or a so-called contact part, while it
was conventionally practiced that after an ohmic contact
material composed of group IV polycrystalline semi-conductor
material was laid down at a position directly
above the element, the electrode of a metal or metal
silicide containing a low-melting metal such as Al and
the group IV polycrystalline semiconductor material were
joined off the position directly above the element, it
is contemplated that metal or metal silicide is also
joined directly above the element at the same time.On the other hand, polycrystalline semiconductor 
material (e.g., group IV) is undesirable to use as the
lead-out wiring, because as the operation frequency of
element increases, the movement of carriers for carrying
electric current can not follow it, whereby such a
constitution is now being adopted that the electrode of
metal or metal silicide is contacted directly above the
element from the viewpoint of high speed operation.However, a low-melting point metal in the metal or
metal silicide for use as low resistive wiring material
greatly diffuses into polycrystalline semiconductor
material, and when a metal or metal silicide contact is
made directly above the element, the low-melting metal
will diffuse into the element portion, bringing above
degradation of element characteristics in some cases.
Accordingly, to suppress the diffusion of low-melting
metal, a barrier metal may be disposed between the metal
or metal silicide and polycrystalline semiconductor
material. With this constitution, the diffusion of low-melting
metal is surely suppressed, and the degradation
of element characteristics is not caused, but because of
a step of depositing and patterning the barrier metal
interposed, the process is more complex, with its costs
increased. Document US-A-4 637 836 discloses a method to prevent
diffusion of boron from a silicon by pre-doping the silicon
with phosphorus ions.The publication IBM Technical Disclosure Bulletin,
