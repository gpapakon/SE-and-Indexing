<ABSTRACT>
On an expansion head (1) for expander tools for hollow workpieces, a cup (2) with a guide flange (3) pointing radially inwards and with a set of expansion jaws (4) in the form of sectors, each of which is guided individually so as to be radially moveable on the guide flange (3) by means of an internal-flange sector (5) and of an external-flange sector (6) and of a radial groove (7) formed between these. In order to be able to increase the radial travel of the expansion jaws without loss of the guiding properties, the external-flange sectors (6) have essentially at least the same diameter as the internal-flange sectors (5) and both the internal-flange sectors (5) and the external-flange sectors (6) each have a hole (8 and 9 respectively), in each of which one end of a guide pin (10) is accommodated. Arranged in the guide flange (3) are radial guide grooves for the acceptance and movement of in each case one of the guide pins (10). Annular tension springs (15, 16) for resetting the expansion jaws are furthermore arranged both on the internal-flange sectors (5) and on the external-flange sectors (6).

Expansion head (1) for expander tools for hollow workpieces, in 
particular pipe ends, comprising a cap (2) with radially inward 

oriented guide flange (3) and a set of sectorially formed expanding 
jaws (4) which are respectively individually guided on a guide 

flange (3) by means of an internal flange sector (5) and an 
external flange sector (6), and a thereinbetween established radial 

groove (7), and on the interior flange sectors (5) are arranged 
circular tension springs (16) for returning the expanding jaws (4), 

and in the interior flange sectors (5) are arranged bores (8) in 
which the one end of guide pins (10) are received, and in the 

guide flange (3) are arranged radial guide grooves (14) to receive 
and move the guide pins (10), 
characterised in that
a) the external flange sectors (6) have at least the same diameter 
as the internal flange sectors (5) and bores (9) which receive 

the other ends of the guide pins (10); 
b) the guide pins (10) are pressure-seated in at least one of the 
two associated bores (8, 9); 
c) annular tension springs (15) for returning the expansion jaws 
(4) are also arranged on the external flange sectors (6). 
Expansion head according to Claim 1, 
characterised in that
 the 
bores (9) for the guide pins (10) in the external flange sectors (6) 

are pocket bores. 
Expansion head according to Claim 1, 
characterised in that
 the 
guide pins (10) are notch pins.
