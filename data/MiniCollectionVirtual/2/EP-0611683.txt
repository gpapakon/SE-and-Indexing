<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an air bag provided 
with reinforcing belts. More particularly, the present 
invention relates to an air bag provided with reinforcing 
belts and having a high burst strength. Recently, air bag systems have become practically 
employed as a safety device for protecting the occupants 
of an automobile. Usually, an air bag which was produced 
by coating a surface of a smooth woven fabric with a 
chloroprene rubber or silicone rubber, cutting the coated 
fabric into a circular form, superposing two cut fabric 
pieces, namely circular top and bottom cloths, on each 
other, seam-joining them at the circumferential edge 
portions thereof, and attaching reinforcing belts 
(straps) to the top and bottom cloths, is used. Since the air bag is used by inflating it with a gas 
blown in an instant thereinto, the air bag is required to 
have no risk of bursting by a rapid raising of the inside 
pressure thereof, namely a high burst strength. In the 
air bag provided with the reinforcing belts, the bursting 
of the air bag is mainly localized and occurs at the 
connecting portions of the belts and the air bag. To 
prevent this bursting, various attempts have been made. 
For example, Japanese Examined Patent Publication 
(Kokoku) No. 58-41216 discloses that an elastic material 
such as a bias cloth has been used for the belts. Also, Japanese Unexamined Patent Publication (Kokai) 
No. 1-122,751 discloses that reinforcing fabric pieces 
have been arranged so as to bridge the main air bag 
portion (a top cloth and a bottom cloth) and the belts 
and join the main air bag portion with the belts through 
the reinforcing fabric pieces. Further, Japanese Unexamined Patent Publication  
 
(Kokai) No. 3-164,349 discloses that the main air bag 
portion has been seam-joined to a belt catcher in a 
direction at right angles to the longitudinal center line 
direction of the belt. Furthermore, in Japanese Unexamined Patent 
Publication No. 3-248,945, in accordance with the same 
thinking as in Japanese Unexamined Patent Publication 
No. 3-164,349, the main air bag portion and the belt 
catcher are seam-joined to each other along a straight 
line in a direction at right angles to the longitudinal 
center line direction of the belt, and this seam is made 
in a smaller seaming pitch than that in another portion 
of the air bag. Nevertheless, the above-mentioned prior arts did not 
satisfactorily enhance the burst strength, and thus a 
further enhancement of the burst strength is strongly 
demanded.
