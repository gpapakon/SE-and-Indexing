active matrix type liquid crystal display device. This
active matrix type liquid crystal display device has a
plurality of gate bus lines 101, 101, ... extending in
parallel with each other and a plurality of source bus
lines 102, 102, ... extending in parallel with each
other so as to cross each gate bus line 101 in its
display region 100. Each gate bus line 101 extending
outside of the display region 100 is connected to a
gate drive circuit 104.One end of each source bus line 102 extending
outside of the display region 100 is connected to
analog switches S', S'... in a source drive circuit
105. Each analog switch S' is connected to a
common shift register 106 and a common data signal
line 107. One electrode of each source bus line additional
capacitor 108 for holding a data signal is
connected to each source bus line 102 and the other
electrode thereof is connected to a common source
capacitor line 109. A thin film transistor (hereinafter, referred
to as TFT) 103 is provided in the vicinity of each
crossed point of the gate bus line 101 and the source
bus line 102 so as to be connected to both of the
lines. A gate electrode of each TFT 103 is connected
to the gate bus line 101, and an on/off control signal
is supplied from the gate drive circuit 104 to the
TFT 103 through the gate bus line 101. A source electrode
of each TFT 103 is connected to the source bus
line 102, and when the TFT 103 is turned on, a data
signal is supplied from the source drive circuit 105 to
a drain electrode side through the source bus line 102.
The drain electrode of each TFT 103 is connected to a
liquid crystal capacitor (hereinafter, referred to as
LC capacitor) 110 and a storage capacitor 111. The LC
capacitor 110, the storage capacitor 111 and the
TFT 103 are included in a pixel portion. The LC capacitor
110 includes a pixel electrode (not shown), a
counter electrode (not shown) facing the pixel electrode,
and a liquid crystal layer (not shown) interposed
between these electrodes. A display is performed
by applying a voltage to the LC capacitor 110 to induce
the change in electro-optic characteristics of the
liquid crystal layer. One end of the LC capacitor 110
is connected to the TFT 103 and the other end thereof
is grounded. One end of the storage capacitor 111 is
connected to the TFT 103
