<ABSTRACT>
A wrapping machine (10) comprises a ring (16) 
rotatable on a frame (12), a ledge (20) to support a 

package (P) being wrapped, and a carriage (30) supporting 
a roll (R) of plastic film (F) and movable with the ring 

(16) to wrap the film (F) around the ledge (20) and around 
a package (P) supported by it. A severing arm (70) is 

pivotable between a horizontal position underlying the 
ledge (20) and a vertical position and carried a heated 

severing wire (72). Also, a spacing arm (60) is pivotably 
movable between a horizontal position underlying the ledge 

(20) and a vertical position and spaces an outer film layer 
from the ledge (20). In one embodiment, the severing arm 

(70) carries heated welding elements (74), and the spacing 
arm (60) applies a partial vacuum to cause a severed film 

portion (F) to adhere to it. In another embodiment, the 
severed film portion is clamped between the spacing (100) 

and severing (110) arms (Figure 9).

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention pertains to a film-severing mechanism
useful in a machine for wrapping a package with plastic
film supplied on a roll. The mechanism is arranged to
space a portion of an outer film layer from the next prior
film layer and to sever the spaced portion along a
generally straight line. The mechanism may be also
arranged to weld a portion of the severed film layer to and
across the next prior film layer and to remove another
portion of the severed film layer.A machine of a type in widespread use for wrapping
packages with plastic film supplied on a roll, such
as stretch film, comprises a frame, a ring rotatable on the
frame and defining a circular path around a horizontal
axis, a support extending horizontally toward an open
centre of the ring and arranged to support a package being
wrapped, and a carriage mounted to the ring for conjoint
movement with the ring and arranged to support the roll of
film with its axis parallel to the horizontal axis of the
ring. The support may be a ledge or a conveyor. The
carriage is movable along the circular path, around the
ledge, when the ring is rotated so that film from the roll
supported by the carriage is wrapped in successive layers,
around the support and around a package supported by the
support, as the carriage is moved around the ring.A leading edge of the film is secured to the package,
as by taping, before the film is wrapped therearound. After
the support and the package supported by the support have
been wrapped with plural layers of the film, the wrapped
film is severed from the film remaining on the roll, and an
outer layer of the wrapped film is secured to the next
prior layer of the wrapped film, commonly by welding or
taping.Such wrapping machines are available commercially, as
"MSB Stretch Bundlers", from ITW Mima (a unit of Illinois
Tool Works Inc.) of Boca Raton, Florida. Manual machines 
are known, in which the carriage is moved manually along
the circular path defined by the ring. Powered machines are
known, in which the carriage is moved by a motor.In a wrapping machine of the type noted above, as
known heretofore, the film of the outer layer is bunched
into a rope-like configuration when such film is severed
from the film remaining on the roll. Generally, the
rope-like configuration is retained when the outer layer is
secured to the next prior layer, particularly if welding or
taping is used.Such a rope-like configuration can interfere with
stacking or palletizing of the package with other packages.
Also, such a rope-like

A mechanism for use with a machine for wrapping a
package (P) with plastic film (F) supplied on a roll (R),

the machine including a support (20) for supporting a
package (P) being wrapped the support being wrapped with

the package, in which the mechanism is arranged to sever
an outer layer of such film (F) from a next prior layer of

such film (F) wrapped around the support (20) and the
package (P),

   the mechanism comprising:

(a) spacing means (60,100) for spacing a portion of
the outer film layer (F) from the next prior film layer

wrapped around the support (20) and around the package (P),
wherein the spacing means comprises a spacing arm (60,100)

mounted so as to be movable pivotably between a first
horizontal position, in which the spacing arm (60,100)

underlies the support (20) with any prior film layer being
confined between the spacing arm (60,100) and the support

(20) and in which the spacing arm (60,100) is disposed to
be also wrapped by the outer film layer and to space a

portion of the outer film layer from the next prior film
layer, and a second position, in which the spacing arm

(60,100) does not interfere with film (F) being wound
around the support (20) and around the package (P) and,
(b) severing means (72,134) for severing the outer
film layer at the spaced portion along a generally straight

line extending across the spaced portion, into a first
portion integral with film (F) wrapped around the support

(20) and around the package (P) and a second portion
integral with film (F) on the roll (R), in which the

spacing means (60,100) and severing means (72,134) are
provided beside each other, and the film (F) is severed

between the spacing means (60,100) and the severing means
(72, 134).
A mechanism according to claim 1, in which
the second

position is a generally vertical position.
