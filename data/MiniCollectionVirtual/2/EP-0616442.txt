<ABSTRACT>
In a passive optical telecommunication system in which a plurality of decentralised devices are in each case connected via a dedicated optical waveguide connection line to an optical splitter which is connected directly or via at least one further optical splitter to a common optical waveguide connection of the central device via an optical waveguide bus, decentralised devices and a central device transmitting or receiving optical digital signals using the duplex-channel method, to avoid impairment of the receive sensitivity of the central device corresponding to the bit pattern of its transmit signal, the emitter/receiver circuit in the decentralised devices is in each case designed in such a way that the output of the opto-electrical transducer is connected via an electrical received signal invertor to the input of the electro-optical transducer, and an optical delay line, whose delay time is synchronised with the working time of the electrical received signal invertor, is inserted between the output of the electro-optical transducer and the optical waveguide connection line.

Transceiver circuit having an optical fibre 
connection, an optical-to-electrical transducer (EW) for 

light signals received via the optical fibre connection, 
and an electrical-to-optical transducer (SW) for light 

signals to be transmitted via the optical fibre connection, 
in particular for a passive optical telecommunication 

system in which, in each case, a plurality of 
decentral devices (TSt1, ..., TStn), in particular 

subscriber stations or so-called distant units combining 
a plurality of subscriber stations are respectively connected 

via a dedicated optical fibre subscriber line 
(OAL1, ..., OALn) to an optical coupler (V) which is 

connected directly or via at least one further optical 
coupler (V) to a common optical fibre connection of the 

central device (VSt), in particular an exchange, via an 
optical fibre bus (OB), decentralized devices (TSt1, 

...., TStn) and a central device (VSt) transmitting or 
receiving optical digital signals in common-frequency 

operation, characterized in that in the circuit the 
output of the optical-to-electrical transducer (EW) is 

connected to the input of the electrical-to-optical 
transducer (SW) via an electrical received signal 

inverter (J), and in that there is inserted between the 
output of the electrical-to-optical transducer (SW) and 

its optical fibre connection, which is connected to the 
said transducer (SW) and to the input of the optical-to-electrical 

transducer (EW), an optical delay line (VL) 
having a delay time tuned to the operating time of the 

electrical received signal inverter (J).  
 
Transceiver circuit according to Claim 1, characterized 
in that the optical delay line (VL) is inserted 

between the output of the electrical-to-optical transducer 
(SW) and an optical directional coupler (RK) 

connecting the optical fibre connection of the transceiver 
circuit to the input of the optical-to-electrical 

transducer (EW) and the output of the electrical-to-optical 
transducer (SW). 
Transceiver according to Claim 1 or 2, characterized 
by a change, corresponding to a change in the level 

of received "1" light signal elements, in the additional 

modulation of the electrical-to-optical transducer (SW) 
by the electrical received signal inverter (J).
