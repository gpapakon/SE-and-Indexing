<ABSTRACT>
To produce propylene oxide, a reaction liquid comprised of 
propylene, hydrogen peroxide 

and propylene oxide and a vapor purge stream is passed through the 
bed of solid catalyst 

at reaction conditions in each of a series of catalyst-packed reaction 
zones (2,14,22,30), the resulting 

mixture is separated in each zone into a vapor stream which passes to 
the next reaction 

zone and a reaction liquid stream (8,18,26), which is removed 
and cooled to remove exothermic 

heat of reaction. Some of the cooled liquid (11,20,28) is recycled 
to the zone from which it was 

removed and some (13,21,29) is passed to the next in the series 
of reaction zones. Also provided is a reactor for carrying out the 

reaction.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a catalytic converter or
reactor and a process for carrying out highly exothermic
reactions.Substantial difficulties are encountered in carrying out
highly exothermic reactions where reactants and/or products
are temperature sensitive. For example, the catalytic
liquid phase reaction of propylene and hydrogen peroxide to
produce propylene oxide is a highly exothermic reaction while
hydrogen peroxide decomposition is quite temperature
sensitive. In such a reaction, heat of reaction must be
removed and the reaction temperature must be carefully
controlled in order to achieve optimum results. Removal of
the exothermic heat of reaction without causing excess
temperature rise presents a serious problem.Conventional reactors for exothermic reactions are
usually of two types:
(1) Quench type which consist of multiple fixed beds
with cold feed quench injected in between beds(2) Tubular type in which the catalyst is placed in the
tubes of a vertical shell and tube heat exchangerIf the heat of reaction is high, the first type does not
provide sufficient heat removal. This can be overcome by
recycling 
cold reactor effluent but this results in the disadvantages
associated with back-mixed reactors.The tubular reactor cost becomes prohibitive when high heats
of reaction have to be removed through heat exchanger surfaces
operating with a low heat transfer coefficient. There is also a
temperature gradient from the center of the tube which is often
detrimental to a process which requires nearly isothermal
conditions.U.S. Patents 2,271,646 and 2,322,366 provide catalytic
converters for use in catalytic cracking and the like reactions
wherein the converters are divided into a series of zones and the
reaction mixture from one zone is removed and externally heated or
cooled before being returned to the next reaction zone. Such
converters are not suitable for the effective temperature and
reagent concentration control of a highly exothermic system as is
achieved in accordance with the present invention.In accordance with the present invention, a catalytic
converter tower is provided containing a series of separate zones
each having a bed of solid catalyst contained therein. Liquid
reaction mixture containing the appropriate reactants is introduced
into a zone and passed at reaction conditions through the catalyst
bed. The resulting reaction mixture is removed from the reactor
and the exothermic heat of reaction is removed by indirect heat
exchange. The great bulk of the cooled reaction

A continuous process for the exothermic reaction of propylene and hydrogen
peroxide in the liquid phase to produce propylene oxide in a series of separate reaction

zones each containing a packed bed of solid catalyst, wherein a reaction liquid comprised
of propylene, hydrogen peroxide and propylene oxide as well as a vapor purge stream is

passed through the bed of the solid catalyst at reaction conditions in each of the reaction
zones, the resulting mixture is separated in each zone into a vapor stream which passes to

the next reaction zone and a reaction liquid stream, the reaction liquid stream from each
zone is removed and separately cooled to remove exothermic heat of reaction generated in

the zone from which the liquid is removed, 60-90% of the cooled liquid is recycled to the
zone from which it was removed and 10-40% of the cooled liquid is passed to the next in

the series of reaction zones.
A process as claimed in Claim 1 characterised in that a propylene vapor stream is
passed through the series of reaction zones to purge oxygen generated therein.
A process as claimed in Claim 1 or Claim 2 characterised in that a portion of the
net hydrogen peroxide feed is fed to each reaction zone.
A process as claimed in any one of Claims 1 to 3 characterised in that a diluent
liquid is fed to the first of the series of reaction zones.
A process as claimed in Claim 4 characterised in that the diluent liquid is
isopropanol. 
A process as claimed in Claim 4 characterised in that the diluent liquid is a
mixture of isopropanol and methanol.
A catalytic converter suitable for the production of propylene oxide by the
exothermic reaction of propylene and hydrogen peroxide and comprising a series of

separate zones each containing a packed bed of solid catalyst, means of introducing
reaction liquid into each zone and passing the liquid through the bed of solid catalyst

contained therein at exothermic reaction conditions, means for removing all reaction
liquid from each zone, means for cooling all the removed reaction liquid from each zone

and recycling 60-90% of the cooled liquid to the zone from which it was removed, means
for passing 10-40% of the cooled liquid to the next succeeding zone, and means for

withdrawing liquid product from the last of the said separate zones.
