<ABSTRACT>
A putter (10) is provided with concentrations of mass 
in the toe (16) and heel (18) portions, and the putter head (12) 

is otherwise configured so that its center of gravity (CG) is 
approximately midway between the toe (16) and the heel (18) of 

the putter head (12). Maximum stability within practical 
constraints is achieved by an especially configured hosel (20) 

which slants upwardly and forwardly from proximate the heel (18) 
of the putter head (12) and positions the putter shaft (22) so 

that its longitudinal axis (24) intersects an imaginary line (26) 
at a point forward of the face (14) of the putter (10) with the 

imaginary line (26) being normal to the face (14) of the putter 
(10) and passing through the center of gravity (CG) thereof.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates in general to golf clubs and more 
particularly to a putter having an improved balanced design. As is well known by everyone who plays golf, putting has 
plagued all types of players, and the quest for improved 
putters and putting techniques never ends. As recently as 
about 30 years ago, engineering principles were applied to the 
design of putters for the first time, and a design which became 
known as "heel-toe balanced" was devised. Prior to this 
innovation, putters were for the most part essentially flat, 
platelike structures commonly referred to as "blade" putters. Briefly, a putter designed in accordance with the 
"heel-toe balance" principle has its mass concentrated in the 
heel and toe of the putter head. This provides an increased 
moment of inertia that causes the putter head to resist 
twisting whenever the golf ball is struck at a point on the 
putter face which is away from the "sweet spot" of the putter. 
Such a putter is disclosed in U.S. Patent No. 3,042,405 which 
issued on July 3, 1962.  
 In addition to having the heel-toe balance, the putter 
design disclosed in US-A-3,042,405 has another design feature 
which is commonly referred to as "face balance". A face balanced 
putter is one having equal moment arms, i.e. the concentrated 
masses at the heel and toe are equally distant from the axis of 
rotation. This is accomplished by connecting the shaft of the 
putter centrally between the toe and the heel of the putter so 
that it is located proximate the center of gravity. The face balancing design concept has been accomplished in 
another manner such as that fully disclosed in U.S. Patent No. 
3,954,265 issued on May 4, 1976 to David L. Taylor. In this 
case, the shaft is attached to the putter head proximate the 
heel, and the shaft is bent into a special configuration. The 
special bends in the shaft are located at its lower end, to 
conform to the Rules of Golf as defined by the United States 
Golf Association and the Royal and Ancient regulating body of 
Scotland. The shaft bends locate the longitudinal axis of the 
shaft, as defined by the straight portion of the shaft, so that 
the axis will pass through the center of gravity of the putter 
head. We have been marketing another unpatented variation of a 
putter incorporating the face balanced design concept which we 
have identified as the "Z" putter. In this particular putter 
the shaft is bent so that the longitudinal axis of the straight  
 
portion of the shaft will intersect a line which extends 
no

<CLAIMS>
A face-balanced golf club (52; 62) for putting, comprising: 

a) a putter head (12) having a face (14), a toe (16) and a heel (18) and 
having a center of gravity (CG) which is located within said putter 

head (12) and lies rearwardly of the face (14) on an imaginary line (26) that extends normally 
relative to the face (14) of said putter head (12); 
b) an elongated shaft (22) having a longitudinal axis (24) and 
a lower end; characterised by 
c) a hosel (54; 64) having a leg portion (56; 66) with a lower end 
and an upper end, said leg portion (56; 66) slanting upwardly and 

forwardly from its lower end which is attached to said putter 
head (12) proximate the heel (18) of said putter head (12) to its upper end 

which is disposed above said putter head (12) and which is forwardly 
offset relative to the face (14) of said putter head (12), a boss (58; 68) on the 

upper end of said leg portion (56; 66) to which the lower end of said 
shaft (22) is attached, said hosel (54; 64) being configured so that an 

extension (24a) of the longitudinal axis (24) of said shaft (22) intersects the 
imaginary line (26) of said putter head (12) at a point (36) which is forwardly 

disposed relative to both the center of gravity (CG) and the face (14) of 
said putter head (12); and 
d) first and second mass concentrations (M1, M2) located 
adjacent the toe (16) and heel (18), respectively, of said putter head (12), 

each of said first (M1) and second (M2) mass concentrations being  
 

arranged such that the length of a second imaginary line (38) 
extending from said first mass concentration (M1) to said 

intersection point (36) is equal to the length of a third imaginary 
line (40) extending from said second mass concentration (M2) to said 

intersection point (36), said first and second mass concentrations (M1, M2) 
being disposed on opposite sides of the center of gravity (CG) of 

the putter head (12) and being generally aligned with each other in 
a heel-to-toe direction. 
The face-balanced golf club of claim 1, wherein said first 
and second mass concentrations (M1, M2) and said putter head (12) are 

configured so that said center of gravity (CG) is disposed 

substantially centrally of said putter head (12) intermediate the 
toe (16) and heel (18) thereof.
