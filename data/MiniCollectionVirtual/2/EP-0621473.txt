<ABSTRACT>
The device (1) for taking a sample of molten metal, especially cast iron, comprises elongate support means (2) for handling the device, and sample-taking means (P) mounted at one end of the support means and intended to be momentarily immersed in a bath of molten metal and then to be withdrawn therefrom. These sample-taking means (P) comprise a mould (4) having an edge (9) and including a housing (6) which communicates with the outside via a channel (7), this mould (4) being surrounded by a jacket (19) made of granular material, in particular of the foundry-sand kind, the grains of which are held together by a binder. The channel (7) is entirely bounded by walls of the mould (4) and emerges, on the outside, via an opening (8) located on the edge (9) of the mould. The edge (9) of the mould, including the opening (8), is free of any jacket and is flush with or extends beyond the external surface of the jacket (19).
