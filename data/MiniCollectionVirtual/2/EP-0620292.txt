<ABSTRACT>
A steel material for colored spring is formed with a 
metallic deposit on the surface. The metallic deposit 

contains copper, zinc, and chrome. In an annealing process, 
copper and zinc diffuse in the deposit to exhibit a gold 

color tone while chrome is oxidized to exhibit dark gray 
color tone. The combination of these color tones exhibits a 

beautiful black color tone which is distinguishable from 
normal spring. The deposit improves the formability in the 

spring shaping process.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a steel material for a colored 
spring, a method for producing a colored spring, and a colored 
spring. Springs such as helical springs and plate springs are 
indispensable parts in assembling a variety of machines. 
Steel materials for spring are divided roughly into steel 
wires and steel plates. The steel wires are classified 
further into hard steel wires, piano wires and stainless 
steel wires specified in JIS or Japanese Industrial Standard. 
These basic steels have very similar surface color 
tone. Particularly, the hard steel wires and the piano 
wires are indistinguishable only based on the surface color 
tone. The stainless steel wires have generally excellent 
gloss compared to the hard steel wires or the piano wires, 
and therefore it is not difficult to distinguish the hard 
steel wires or the piano wires from the stainless steel 
wires. However, in the case that a so-called oil drawing or 
wet drawing, in which the wire is drawn by applying a tensile 
force while applying oil to the surface of the wire, is 
performed to the hard steel wires or the piano wires, these  
 
wires exhibit increased gloss. As a result, the hard steel 
wires or the piano wires become indistinguishable from the 
stainless steel wires. The fact that the type of spring is indistinguishable 
based on the surface color tone as described above will 
cause the problem that springs which are different in type 
but similar in shape would be used inadvertently together in 
the manufacturing process of various machines. Accordingly, 
the springs are colored to avoid this problem. Figs. 5A and 5B show conventional coloring methods in 
producing springs. As shown in these figures, the conventional 
methods for coloring spring can be classified roughly 
into the method A shown in Fig. 5A according to which the 
coloring is applied before springs are formed and the method 
B shown in Fig. 5B according to which the coloring is applied 
after springs are formed. More specifically, according to the conventional method 
A, the basic steel is first colored. Subsequently, a wire 
drawing is applied in the case that the basic steel is a 
steel wire, whereas a rolling is applied in the case that 
the basic steel is a steel sheet. The basic steel which has 
been colored and drawn/rolled is then shaped into springs 
using a specified shaping apparatus. Thereby, intermediate 
products can be obtained. These intermediate products are 
made into springs through a process of annealing the intermediate  
 
products
