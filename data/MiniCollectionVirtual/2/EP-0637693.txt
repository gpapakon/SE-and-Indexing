<ABSTRACT>
A control means for a hydraulic motor (11) comprises a 
directional valve (12) for communicating hydraulic 

pressure fluid from a pressure source (10) to the motor 
(11) and including pilot pressure operated activating 

means (13, 14), pilot valves (17, 18) connected to the 
activating means (13, 14) and to the pressure source (10) 

and a manually operable activating lever (15) 
mechanically connectable to the directional valve (12) 

via a coupling (24, 55, 56). A pressure fluid operated 
actuating means (25, 47, 48) is associated with the 

coupling (24, 55, 56) to shift the latter when 
pressurized from an engaged condition and a disengaged 

condition, and a mode shifting valve (19) is connected 

both to the actuating means (25, 47, 48) and to the pilot 
valves (17, 18) and arranged to pressurize simultaneously 

the pilot valves (17, 18) and the coupling (24, 55, 56) 
disengaging actuating means (25, 47, 48) to avoid double 

activation of the directional valve (12).

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a control means for controlling
the operation of a hydraulic motor.In particular, the invention concerns a hydraulic motor
control means comprising a directional valve for
communicating pressure fluid from a pressure source to
the motor, and including pilot pressure operated
activating means, pilot valves connected to said
activating means and to the pressure source, and a
manually operable activating means mechanically connected
to the directional valve via a coupling means (see for example FR 2 295 275 A).A problem inherent in hydraulic motor control means of
the above type, which comprises both pilot pressure
operated activating means and a manually operable
activating means, is the risk for unintentional or
accidental activation of the directional valve by the
pilot pressure activating means while controlling the
motor operation by the manual activating means, or vise
versa. In crane or excavator applications, which are the
most common applications for this type of control system,
accidental double activation of one or more directional
valves would cause undesired and unexpected movements of
crane or excavator arms which would be hazardeous to
personnel and equipment.In previous control systems of this type several more or
less successful attempts have been made to avoid
undesirable activation by means of the control lever
while the system is operated by remote control via the 
pilot valves and the pilot pressure activating means on
the directional valve.One such attempt comprises the application of a kind of
hood which is intended to cover the activating lever or
levers when the remote control is used, and which is
coupled to a safety stop switch for inhibiting operation
of the system via the remotely controlled pilot valves as
the hood is removed from the lever or levers.Another previously suggested way to avoid accidental
activation of the directional valve by the control lever
comprises a position detecting means coupled to the valve
spindle of the directional valve and arranged to cause
activation of a safety stop circuit if there is a
discrepancy between the actual position of the valve
spindle and a position the valve spindle should occupy at
a certain pressure drop.A third way previously suggested to solve the problem of
how to prevent double activation of the directional valve
means simply that the control lever or levers are
arranged to be removed from the valve as remote control
is performed.The main object of the invention is to improve safety at
hydraulic motor

<CLAIMS>
Control means for a hydraulic motor, comprising
a directional valve (12) for communicating selectively

pressure fluid from a pressure source (10) to the motor
(11) and including pilot pressure operated activating

means (13, 14), pilot valves (17, 18) connected to said
activating means (13, 14), and a manually operable

shifting means (15) mechanically connected to said
directional valve (12) via a coupling means (24, 55, 56),


characterized in
 that said coupling means
(24, 55, 56) is shiftable between an engaged condition

and a disengaged condition by a pressure operated
actuating means (25, 47, 48), and a mode shifting valve

(19) communicating on one hand with said pressure source
(10) and on the other hand with said actuating means (25,

47, 48) as well as with said pilot valves (17, 18) and
arranged to shift the control means from a first

operation mode in which said actuating means (25, 47, 48)
makes said coupling means (24, 55, 56) occupy its engaged

condition and at the same time said pilot valves (17, 18)
are disconnected from said pressure source (10), to a

second operation mode wherein said coupling means (24,
55, 56) is shifted to its disengaged condition by said

actuating means (25, 47, 48) and at the same time said
pilot valves (17, 18) are connected to said pressure

source (10).
Control means according to claim 1, wherein said
actuating means (25, 47, 48) comprises a single acting

piston-cylinder device which includes a spring means (26,
53) for biassing the piston (27, 48) of said piston

cylinder device (25, 47, 48) toward said engaged 
condition of said coupling means (24, 55, 56).
Control means according to claim 2, wherein said
mode shifting valve (19) is arranged either to connect

simultaneously said piston-cylinder device of said
actuating means (25, 47, 48) and said pilot valves (17,

18) to said pressure source (10), or to disconnect
simultaneously said piston-cylinder device of said

actuating means (25, 47, 48) and said pilot valves (17,
18) from said pressure source (10).
Control system for two or more hydraulic motors
and including a control means according to claim 1 for

each motor, wherein said mode shifting valve (19) is just
one in number and common to all of said control means.
