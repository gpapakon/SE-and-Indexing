<DESCRIPTION>
 Coaxial Cable Plu /CouplingThis invention relates to a coaxial cable plug, or a coaxial cable coupling. ., In particular it relates to such a plug or coupling comprising (1) an insulating body for supporting directly the inner conductor of the coaxial cable or for supporting a contact pin (in the case of a coaxial cable plug) or a contact socket (in the case of a coaxial cable coupling), containing a blind bore for receiving the inner conductor of the coaxial cable, (2) an outer conductor contact element and (3) a contacting cutting cylinder which is positioned, in use, in electrical contact with the outer conductor contact element and with the outer conductor of the coaxial cable.As used herein the term contacting cutting cylinder means a contacting cylinder that makes contact (with the outer conductor of the coaxial cable ) by cutting into the coaxial cable, e.g. by penetrating between the outer conductor and the dielectric of the coaxial cable.DE-3141966-A1 discloses a connection device for coaxial cables and a two- way coupling of similar construction. It describes an outer conductor contact element, that is in the form of a contact cylinder for contacting the outer conductor of the coaxial cable, the contact cylinder penetrating, in the coupling position, between the dielectric and the outer conductor of the coaxial cable. This known solution has the advantage that faulty connections, and in particular short-circuits between the outer and inner conductors of the coaxial cable are substantially avoided. The danger of such a short circuit is particularly high when the outer conductor of the coaxial cable is in the form of a braid, since in such a case there is a significant danger that, with improper connection, a bridge may be formed between the outer conductor and the inner conductor of the coaxial cable by that outer conductor braid.* However, notwithstanding its advantages, a considerable drawback of the M known solution, described in DE-3141966, resides in the fact that the construction* is of a very complicated kind with very many individual parts, locking tapers, 

 screw sockets, union nuts, sealing rings and so on. These have to be laboriously assembled by the user and the mounting of the device on the coaxial cable is therefore quite complicated.A connection for a coaxial cable that is of a similarly complicated construction is disclosed in DE-4100600-A1. This describes a connection for coaxial cables in which both the inner and the outer conductor are formed from a stranded conductor or a

Claims
1. A device that is a coaxial cable plug, or a coaxial cable coupling comprising:
(a) an outer conductor contact element for providing an electrical contact for the plug or coupling from the outer conductor of a coaxial cable;
