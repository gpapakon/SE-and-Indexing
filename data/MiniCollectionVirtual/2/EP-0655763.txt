<ABSTRACT>
The gun according to present invention has a triple electrodes 
part as a source of the electron beam, 

and prefocusing and main lens part for focusing and 
accelerating the beam. The 

prefocusing lens part includes a plurality of focusing 
electrodes (21,22,23,24) for forming at least one quadrapole lens in 

which the intensity of vertical lens is weaker than that 
of horizontal lens. According to the present invention, 

the effect of the spherical aberration to the beam 
entering the main lens can be reduced.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an electron gun for 
a color picture tube, and particularly to an in-line type 
electron gun for a color picutre tube. An electron gun for a color picture tube is mounted 
in the neck of the tube and generates thermions. It 
generally comprises a triple electrodes part having one 
or more cathodes as the source of thermions, a 
prefocusing lens part and a main lens part for forming 
electromagnetic lens by the potential difference. As a relatively higher voltage is applied to 
electrodes for the main lens part comparing with other 
electrodes, the magnification of the main electromagnetic 
lens formed therebetween, is enlarged to inflict a large 
spherical aberration to the electron beam passing 
therethrough. To reduce the spherical aberration of the 
main lens part, it has been generally adopted a rim  
 
electrode 10 having a large beam passing hole 11 
though which three beams concurrently pass, to weaken 
the magnification of the electromagnetic lens and reduce 
the spherical aberration. But in this case, the reduced 
magnification of the main lens cannot sufficiently focus 
the electron beam, thus the prefocusing lens part is 
fabricated between the main lens part and the triple 
electrodes part to stepwisely focus the electron beam 
from the triple electrodes. In a typical prefocusing lens part, a plurality of 
focusing electrodes having beam passing holes for 
forming a plurality of quadrapole lenses are fabricated 
between the triple electrodes part and the main lens 
part, and a voltage applying to the triple electrodes part 
or a high voltage applying to an anode electrode, which 
constitutes the main lens part, is selectively applied to 
those electrodes to focus the electron beam. But the 
application of relatively high or low voltage to 
electrodes of the prefocusing lens part as described 
above, results in a formation of a large magnification 
electromagnetic lens between those electrodes to 
increase the spherical aberration component of the lens 
and cause an arc discharge between electrodes. It is therefore an object of the present invention to 
provide an electron gun for a color picture tube capable 
of reducing the effect of the spherical aberration to the 
electron beam passing the prefocusing lens part and 
preventing the transverse deformation of the beam to 
obtain a uniform beam spot all over the screen. It is another object of the present invention to 
provide an electron gun for a color picture tube to 
improve the assembly precision of the
