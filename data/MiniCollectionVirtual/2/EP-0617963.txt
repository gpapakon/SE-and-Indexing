<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a useful lipid 
metabolism improving medicinal composition. More 
particularly, this invention relates to a useful lipid 
metabolism improving medicinal composition containing 
an ascorbyl tocopheryl phosphate compound or a 
pharmacologically acceptable salt thereof. Hyperlipidemia is generally considered to be a 
risk factor for arteriosclerosis. It is also known 
that arteriosclerotic changes occur as plasma lipids, 
particularly cholesterol, adhere to, and become 
deposited on, the arterial wall. Recent advances in 
research in this field have shown that an increase in 
low-density lipoprotein (LDL), among plasma lipids, 
plays a major role in the pathogenesis of 
arteriosclerosis, while high-density lipoprotein (HDL) 
contributes to the removal and decomposition of the 
cholesterol which has been deposited on the vascular 
wall and cell membrane, thus acting as an 
antiarteriosclerotic factor. Therefore, with the view of treating and  
 
preventing hyperlipidemia, which may be of divergent 
etiologies, and of arteriosclerosis and other diseases 
associated with hyperlipidemia, efforts are being made 
to develop blood cholesterol-lowering drugs, 
particularly drugs which would reduce the low-density 
lipoprotein level and increase the high-density 
lipoprotein level in the blood. Under the circumstances, the inventors of this 
invention explored for compounds having potent lipid 
metabolism-improving activity. As a consequence, the 
inventors discovered that certain ascorbyl tocopheryl 
diester compounds of phosphoric acid and their 
pharmacologically acceptable salts have meritorious 
lipid metabolism-improving activity, for example the 
action to reduce LDL and increase HDL effectively and, 
based on this finding, did further research to complete 
this invention. This invention relates to a the use of lipid metabolism 
improving medicinal composition containing a phosphoric 
acid diester compound of the following formula 
(hereinafter referred to as the present compound) or a 
pharmacologically acceptable salt thereof.  
 
 
(wherein R1 and R2 are the same or different and each 
represents a hydrogen atom or a methyl group). The present compound to be used in the lipid 
metabolism improving medicinal composition of this 
invention can be synthesized by the processes described 
in, interalia, Japanese Patent (JP) Publication Hei-2-44478 
and JP Hei-5-23274 or any processes analogous 
thereto. The present compound for use in the lipid 
metabolism improving composition of
