<ABSTRACT>
Movable insulated conveyor for the continuous casting of 
slabs, billets, blooms or other products, which is installed 

in line with a continuous casting plant (13) comprising at 
least two casting lines (11a-11b), at least one shears (14) 

and a first stationary tunnel furnace (15) to accommodate 
and accelerate segments of slabs (31) being positioned 

between the continuous casting plant (13) and a rolling 
train (12), a movable tunnel furnace (16) possibly being 

included in succession to the stationary tunnel furnace 
(15), at least one of the movable insulated conveyors (19) 

being comprised in succession to the stationary tunnel 
furnace (15) and/or upstream of, and in direct cooperation 

with, the rolling train (12), the movable insulated conveyor 
(19) including a l
ower base (32) to support rollers (33) 
conveying the segments of slabs (31) and an upper insulated 

and heated hood (20), which at least in the working position 
is immovable laterally and lengthwise, the lower supporting 

base (32) being capable of being oriented at least laterally 
about a substantially vertical axis of rotation (17).

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention concerns a movable insulated conveyor for 
the continuous casting of slabs, as set forth in the main 
claim. The slabs with which the invention is concerned are 
advantageously from 700 to 2500 millimetres wide and from 30 
to 200 millimetres thick. However, the invention is also applied to billets, blooms 
or slabs of other dimensions. The invention is applied advantageously to plants which 
connect at least two continuous casting lines to a rolling 
train. The state of the art covers plants for the continuous 
casting of thin slabs, the plants including a plurality of 
casting lines tending one or more rolling lines at the same 
time. EP-A-0492226 discloses, for instance, two or three 
continuous casting lines, each of which is served by tunnel 
furnaces. A disclosure which is analogous from many standpoints is 
contained in JP-A-55-45530. These two prior art documents teach that the rolling line 
is brought into connection alternatively with the casting 
lines by means of rotation of terminal segments of tunnel 
furnaces about the end of the segment in question. This 
rotation takes place at one end of the segments and entails 
problems of travel, inertia, installed power and loss of 
heat; problems concerning the transfer and control of the 
heat delivered by possible burners are also involved. It should be borne in mind that these tunnel furnaces are 
very heavy and their movement is often difficult.  
 DE-A-3.901.582 discloses a lay-out in which a roller 
conveyor fitted to a rotary platform is included between the 
casting lines and the rolling train. The axis of rotation 
of the platform is located at a position at the centre of 
the length of the roller conveyor or at one of the ends of 
the conveyor, but this lay-out too does not overcome the 
above problems of travel, installed power, difficulty of 
movement and loss of heat. Moreover, these lay-outs make it necessary that the lines 
to feed the burners and the means to recover fumes should be 
movable so as to be able to conform to the movements of the 
tunnel furnaces or roller conveyors. Furthermore, these lay-outs do not permit work to be 
carried out, from above with an open top and without 
sidewalls, for maintenance or replacement of the rollers 
positioned on the floor of the tunnel furnaces, although 
such work is quite frequent in view of the thermal and 
mechanical stresses discharged onto the rollers. In the state of the art such work requires either the 
lateral removal of the rollers or the removal of the roof of
