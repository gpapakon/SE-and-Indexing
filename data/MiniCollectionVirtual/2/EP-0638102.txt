<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to isotropic 
polyesters containing repeating units prepared from 
trans- or cis-1,4-cyclohexanedicarboxylic acid, 1,4-butanediol, 
and minor amounts of trans-4,4'-stilbenedicarboxylic 
acid. U.S. 4,459,402 discloses copolyesters of 20-80 mol 
% trans-4,4'-stilbenedicarboxylic acid, 80-20 mol % 
terephthalic acid and/or 80-20 mol % 2,6-naphthalenedicarboxylic 
acid and 100 mol % 1,4-butanediol having 
exceptionally high tensile strength. U.S. 4,414,382 
discloses polyesters based on 90-55 mol % 2,6-naphthalenedicarboxylic 
acid, 10-45 mol % trans-4,4'-stilbenedicarboxylic 
acid, and 100 mol % ethylene 
glycol. U.S. 4,526,822 discloses a polyester of 
terephthalic acid and ethylene glycol modified with 
10-40 mol % trans-4,4'-stilbenedicarboxylic acid. Japanese Kokai 72348/74 discloses blends of 
poly(1,4-butylene terephthalate) and a polyester having 
an aromatic dicarboxylic acid content that has at least 
55 mol % trans-4,4'-stilbenedicarboxylic acid. JP-A-0022752 discloses copolyesters containing trans-1,4-cyclohexanedicarboxylic 
acid and butanediol as the main 
constituents in combination with up to 10 mole % of a further 
diacid other than dimethyl 1,4-cyclohexanedicarboxylic acid. Heretofore, copolyesters prepared from 1,4-butanediol, 
minor amounts of trans-4,4'-stilbenedicarboxylic 
acid and trans- or cis-1,4-cyclohexanedicarboxylic 
acid were not known.  
 The present invention is directed to a copolyester 
having improved thermal stability comprising: 
(A) acid repeating units from 
(1) at least 80 mol % of an acid component of dimethyl 
trans- or cis-1,4-cyclohexanedicarboxylic acid, 
and (2) greater than 0 but less than 20 mol % acid 
component of trans-4,4'-stilbenedicarboxylic acid, 
wherein up to 10 mol % can be substituted with an 
additional aromatic dicarboxylic acid; (B) glycol repeating units from 1,4-butanediol, wherein up 
to 10 mol % can be substituted with another glycol 
containing 2 - 16 carbon atoms;  
wherein the total mol % of acid repeating units and 
glycol repeating units are each 100 mol %; said 
copolyester having an inherent viscosity greater than 
0.2, determined at 25째C in 25/35/40 (wt./wt./wt.) 
phenol, tetrachloroethane/p-chlorophenol at a 
concentration of 0.1 g/100 mL and a melting point of at 
least 200째C. The copolyesters of the present invention are 
useful in molding plastics, fibers, and films and have 
unexpectedly improved thermal stability in the melt. 
The polyesters of the present invention prepared from 
1,4-butanediol,
