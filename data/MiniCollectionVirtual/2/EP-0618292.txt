<ABSTRACT>
The present invention provides recombinant CEA glycoprotein derivatives 
and to methods for their production. These recombinant CEA glycoprotein 

derivatives are characterized in that they are free from cross-reactive CEA-like 
antigens, antigenically indistingiushable from the soluble form of CEA 

shed from tumor cells and devoid of ethanolamine. Said derivatives 
preferably have the amino acid sequence [SEQ ID NO: 1]
. The said CEA 
glycoprotein derivatives may be used as reagents in an immunoassay for the 

diagnosis of neoplastic diseases. The invention also relates to a DNA 
encoding a said recombinant CEA glycoprotein derivative such as the DNA 

having the nucleotide sequence [SEQ ID NO: 2] or a functional equivalent 

sequence thereof. The present invention also relates to recombinant vectors 
comprising a said DNA, which recombinant vector is capable of directing 

the expression of the said DNA in a compatible host cell and to transformed 
host cells containing such a recombinant vector. The recombinant CEA 

glycoprotein derivative of the present invention, preferably integrated in a 
test-kit may be used for determining the presence of tumor cells in a sample 

of body fluid.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to derivatives of the carcinoembryonic 
antigen (CEA). Carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) is one of the most studied human 
tumor markers and is widely used in the diagnosis of neoplastic diseases, 
such as colorectal cancer. Thus, e.g. when the serum levels of CEA are 
elevated in a patient, a drop of CEA levels after surgery means that the 
resection of the tumor was successful. On the other hand a subsequent rise 
in serum CEA levels after surgery indicates that metastases of the original 
tumor may have formed or that new primary tumors have grown. For a 
review see Shively J. E. and Beatty J. D., "CEA-related antigens: molecular 
biology and clinical significance", Crit. Rev. Oncol. Hematol.2, 355-399 
[1985]; and Mach J. -P., Pèlegrin A. and Buchegger F., "Imaging and 
therapy with monoclonal antibodies in non-hematopoietic tumors", Curr. 
Opin. Immunol. 3, 685-693 [1991]. The complete cDNA sequence encoding the CEA protein codes for a 
polypeptide of 702 amino acids consisting of a 34 amino acid residues long 
leader peptide, a 108 amino acid residues long NH₂-terminal domain, three 
homologous repeating domains of 178 amino acid residues and a 
hydrophobic C-terminal domain of 26 amino acid residues (Zimmermann 
W., Ortlieb B., Friedrich R. and von Kleist S., "Isolation and 
characterization of cdna clones encoding the human carcinoembryonic 
antigen reveal a highly conserved repeating structure", Proc. Natl. Acad. 
Sci. U S A84, 2960-2964 [1987]; Beauchemin N., Benchimol S., Cournoyer D., 
Fuks A. and Stanners C. P. "Isolation and characterization of full-length 
functional cDNA clones for human carcinoembryonic antigen", Mol. Cell. 
Biol.7, 3221-3230 [1987]; Oikawa S., Kosaki G. and Nakazato H., "Molecular 
cloning of a gene for a member of carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) gene 
family; signal peptide and N-terminal domain sequences of nonspecific 
crossreacting antigen (NCA)", Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 146, 464-469 
[1987]). The 34 amino acid residues long leader peptide is cleaved from 
the precursor CEA polypeptide in the process of the transfer through the 
endoplasmatic reticulum membrane.  The hydrophobic C-terminal domain is also missing in the mature 
membrane-bound CEA glycoprotein. It has been shown that CEA is 
attached to the membrane through a phosphatidylinositol-glycan tail (PI-G) 
covalently linked through ethanolamine to the COOH-terminal residue of 
mature CEA (Hefta S. A., Hefta L. J., Lee T. D., Paxton R. J. and Shively J.
