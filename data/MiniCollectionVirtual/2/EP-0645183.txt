<CLAIMS>
Catalyst containing silica and an acid phase consisting of sulphuric 
acid and the compound HB(HSO
4
)
4
, the silica having been 
impregnated with said acid phase and said catalyst being such that 

it is essentially composed of particles with an average diameter of 
between 0.1 and 150 µm, in that its content by weight of acid phase 

is greater than 40%, in that the silica, prior to its impregnation with 
said acid phase, has a total porous volume of between 0.5 and 6 

cm
3
 per gram, in that said acid phase contains (in % by weight) 
between 0.4% and 68.8% of the compound HB(HSO
4
)
4
 and 
between 31.2% and 99.6% of the compound H
2
SO
4
, said acid 
phase being characterised by the fact that it does not contain 

sulphuric anhydride or boric acid. 
Catalyst according to claim 1 such that it is essentially constituted 
by particles of average diameter of between 5 and 110 µm. 
Catalyst according to one of claims 1 or 2, such that the silica, prior 
to its impregnation with said acid phase, has a total porous volume 

of between 0.6 and 6 cm
3
 per gram. 
Catalyst according to one of claims 1 to 3, such that the silica, prior 
to its impregnation with said acid phase, has a total porous volume  

 
of between 1.5 and 6 cm
3
 per gram. 
Catalyst according to one of claims 1 to 4 such that the content by 
weight of said acid phase is greater than 70%. 
Preparation of the catalyst according to one of claims 1 to 5 
containing at least two steps, the first step being such that the silica 

is calcined at a temperature greater than 50°C for a duration of 
between 10 minutes and 50 hours, and the second step being such 

that said calcined silica is impregnated by said acid phase. 
Preparation according to claim 6 in which the compound HB(HSO
4
)
4
 
is obtained by reacting 1 mol of boric acid with 3 mols of sulphuric 

anhydride and 1 mol of sulphuric acid. 
Use of the catalyst according to one of claims 1 to 5 or prepared 
according to one of claims 6 or 7 in catalytic alkylation of at least 

one isoparaffin selected from the group formed by isobutane and 
isopentane in the presence of at least one olefin containing 3 to 6 

carbon atoms per molecule, in which the reaction temperature is 
lower than +10°C and the pressure of the reaction zone is sufficient 

to maintain the hydrocarbons in liquid state in said zone. 
Use according to claim 8 in which the catalyst is used in a near-perfect  
 

mixture reaction zone. 
Use according to one of claim 8 in which the catalyst is used in a 
co-flow fluidised bed.
