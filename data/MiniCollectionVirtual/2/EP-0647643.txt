<ABSTRACT>
Bis(3,4-dialkylbenzylidene) sorbitol acetals are provided of the 
formula: 


in which R₁ and R₂ are independently selected from lower 
alkyl groups 

containing 1-4 carbon atoms, or together form a carbocyclic ring 
containing up to 5 carbon atoms. They are useful as plastic additives.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to plastic additives which are useful as nucleating agents and which are especially
useful for improving the optical properties of polymeric materials. More particularly, this invention relates to
certain bis-dialkylbenzylidene sorbitol acetals and polymer compositions thereof which are useful as
materials for food or cosmetic containers and packaging because they do not impart an objectionable taste
or odor to the packaged material.It is known that the addition of nucleating agents to certain polymeric materials, such as polyolefins, can
provide both improved optical and physical properties to the resin. Furthermore, it is known that organic
nucleating agents, such as dibenzylidene sorbitol as disclosed in U.S. Patent No. 4,016,118 to Hamada, et
al. are more effective than much higher melting nucleating agents, such as sodium benzoate, in improving
the clarity of products fabricated from polyolefins, such as sheet, film, bottles, or injection molded parts.
Generally, organic nucleators are more easily dispersed during processing and thus provide a more uniform
effect.The dibenzylidene sorbitol (DBS) nucleating agent mentioned above provides a highly beneficial
combination of cost and performance. It provides excellent clarity enhancement in polypropylene copolymer
and is suitable for food contact packaging because it does not affect the taste of packaged foods. However,
DBS has certain practical deficiencies such as a tendency to plate-out at high processing temperatures and
insufficient clarity improvement in certain applications, such as in thick parts fabricated from polypropylene
homopolymer.In order to overcome these deficiencies, many derivatives of DBS in which the aromatic rings are
substituted with various groups have been proposed. Generally, substituted derivatives of DBS may
overcome the processing and performance disadvantage mentioned above. In particular, alkyl and halogen
substituted derivatives have been especially advantageous in this regard.Thus, Mahaffey, in U.S. Patent No. 4,371,645, discloses compounds of the general formula:

in which R, R1, R2, R3, and R4 are selected from H, lower alkyl, hydroxy, methoxy, mono-and di-alkylamino.
nitro, and halogen, provided that at least one is halogen. Although these compounds may provide excellent
clarity and processing characteristics in polyolefin compositions, the required presence of halogen may be
undesirable, particularly in food contact applications.Kawai, et al. in U.S. Patent No. 4,314.039, discloses
