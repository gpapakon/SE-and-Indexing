<ABSTRACT>
Object: to provide a stable aqueous suspension of liposome, which is free from precipitation, coagulation and particle diameter 
change even after being preserved at 40 °C for 6 months and forms only a reduced amount of lysosome. Constitution: an 

aqueous suspension of liposome characterized by the addition of taurine and benzalkonium chloride.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to an aqueous suspension of 
liposomes which can be preserved stably. Liposomes are closed vesicles comprising a lipid 
bilayer. Taking advantage of bioaffinity of liposomes, a 
number of proposals have been made to incorporate various 
drugs into the inner aqueous phase or the lipid bilayer of 
liposomes for use as a drug carrier. In many cases, however, 
liposomes as suspended in water are colloid-chemically 
instable, tending to undergo agglomeration or fusion among 
themselves, precipitation due to crystallization of the 
membrane component, an increase in particle size, or 
hydrolysis to form lyso-phospholipids that are considered to 
be hemolytic. These changes in effect and appearance result 
in impairment of commercial values. Unexamined Published Japanese Patent Application No. 
42733/87 furnishes a solution for the problem, which 
comprises stabilizing liposomes using an amino acid. What is 
achieved by this technique is stabilization in preservation 
at room temperature or lower temperatures, and stabilization 
in high temperature preservation was still insufficient. The  
 
technique was also insufficient for inhibition of lyso-phospholipid 
formation. An object of the present invention is to provide a 
stable liposome aqueous suspension which does not undergo 
precipitation, agglomeration or change in particle size even 
when preserved at 40°C for 6 months and in which lyso-phospholipid 
formation is suppressed. The present invention provides a liposome aqueous 
suspension containing taurine and benzalkonium chloride. Taurine is added in an amount of from 0.5 to 5.0% by 
weight, preferably from 1.0 to 3.0% by weight, based on the 
total amount of the liposome preparation, which amount 
corresponds to a molar ratio of from 1:13 to 1:133, 
preferably from 1:27 to 1:80, to the membrane component of 
the liposomes. Benzalkonium chloride is added in an amount 
of from 0.05 to 20 mol%, preferably from 2 to 8 mol%, based 
on the membrane component of the liposomes. While not limiting, the liposome aqueous suspension 
of the present invention can be prepared as follows. A 
membrane component hereinafter described is dissolved in an 
organic solvent, and the organic solvent is evaporated. The 
residual lipid membrane is then subjected to (A) hydration 
with an aqueous solution containing taurine and benzalkonium 
chloride or (B) hydration with a taurine aqueous solution 
followed by addition of benzalkonium chloride.  The membrane component which can be used in the 
present
