<ABSTRACT>
A powder coating which can be cured at from 120 to 150 DEG C, comprising A) at least one copolymer of olefinically unsaturated monomers which contains epoxide groups and, if desired, hydroxyl groups, B) at least one curing agent which contains carboxyl or carboxylic anhydride groups, optionally C) auxiliaries and additives which are known per se, and additionally D) polyaddition compounds which contain uretdione groups and have a melting point or melting range which lies within the temperature range from 40 DEG C to 125 DEG C, and which are based on (cyclo)aliphatic diisocyanates, and the use of the powder coating for the coating of any desired heat-resistant substrates, especially as an automotive clear coat.
