<ABSTRACT>
A membrane for the separation of carbon dioxide is 
disclosed which includes a hydrogel film of a cross-linked, 

vinyl alcohol/acrylic acid salt copolymer impregnated with an 
aqueous carrier solution containing a carbon dioxide carrier 

dissolved therein. A composition containing a solvent, 
an alkali metal carbonate or bicarbonates, and a polydentate 

ligand capable of forming a complex with an alkali metal ion 
is suitably used as the carrier solution. This composition 

may also be used for the preparation of a liquid film of a 
carbon dioxide separation membrane.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a membrane for
separating gaseous carbon dioxide from a carbon dioxide-containing
gas mixture, and to a method for the separation
of gaseous carbon dioxide from such a gas mixture.One known method for the separation of gaseous
carbon dioxide-containing gas mixture uses a liquid film
across which carbon dioxide is selectively transported.
The liquid film contains dissolved therein a carrier
substance, typically an alkali metal carbonate (Science,
115, 44(1967); Science, 156, 1481(1967)). While the
known liquid film has relatively good carbon dioxide
selectivity and carbon dioxide permeability, the
separation efficiency thereof is not fully satisfactory
in actual, large scale utilization. In particular, the
known liquid film poses a problem of leakage or drying up
of the carrier liquid during use.US-A-3396510 discloses a gas-permeable membrane
for separating gaseous carbon dioxide from a carbon
dioxide-containing gas mixture, which comprises an
immobilized liquid film formed of an aqueous solution of
an alkali bicarbonate and preferably also a catalyst, in
particular sodium selenate, sodium arsenite, potassium
sulfite and carbonic anhydrase, to enhance the separation
process. A number of different supports for the liquid
film are disclosed.US-A-4954145 discloses a further gas-permeable
membrane for separating gaseous carbon dioxide. A porous
membrane, typically of a polymeric material, is filled
with a substantially non-aqueous composition which
contains as the carrier for the carbon dioxide an alkali
metal salt of a weak acid, for example an alkali metal
carbonate.Chemical & Engineering Progress, 85, No. 3,
March 1989, pages 58-70 explains the mechanisms by which 
gas permeable membranes, such as disclosed in
US-A-3396510 and US-A-4954145 operate to separate the
components of a gas mixture, and provides a table which
lists several possible solvent-carrier-support
combinations for, inter alia, carbon dioxide. One such
combination is water-carbonate used as a bulk liquid,
i.e. without a separate support.The aim of the present invention is to provide
an improved membrane for the separation of gaseous carbon
dioxide.The present invention, in one aspect, provides
a membrane for the separation of gaseous carbon dioxide,
comprising a carbon dioxide-permeable support supporting
a liquid film of an aqueous gaseous carbon dioxide
carrier composition comprising (a) a solvent selected
from water and mixtures of water and a polar organic
solvent, (b) at least one alkali metal salt dissolved
