<ABSTRACT>
A plastic hollow profile, in particular for window or door frames, having at least one cavity in which a metal insert is pushed in the longitudinal direction for reinforcement purposes, the cross-sectional surface area of the cavity being slightly greater than the cross-sectional surface area of the metal insert, and at least one surface of the metal insert butting against an abutment surface of a wall, of the cavity, which is to be reinforced. Arranged along that wall of the cavity located opposite the wall with the abutment surface is at least one protrusion which projects into the region of the cavity which is provided for the metal insert which is to be pushed in. After removing the protrusion part which projects into the region for the metal insert and after pushing-in, the metal insert is arranged in a positively locking manner between the abutment surface and the protrusion.

Hollow plastic section, particularly for window or door
frames, with at least one cavity (42), in which is inserted longitudinally,

for stiffening purposes, a metal insert (41), in
which the cross-sectional surface of the cavity (42) is slightly

larger than the cross-sectional surface of the metal insert
(41), in which at least one face (43) of the metal insert (41)

engages on at least one bearing surface (45) of a wall (44) to
be stiffened of the cavity (42), 
characterized in that
 at least
one spring element (46, 47) is constructed along the wall (48)

of the cavity (42), which faces the wall (44) with the bearing
surface (45), that, in the undeformed state, the spring element

projects into the area of the cavity (42) provided for the metal
insert (41) to be inserted, that the metal insert (41) is placed

in the cavity (42) between the bearing surface (45) and the
spring element (46, 47) elastically deformed by the inserted

metal insert (41), that, in the elastically-deformed state, the
spring element (46, 47) engages on a cavity wall (48) and projects

further into the area of the cavity (42) provided for the
metal insert (41) to be inserted and that on insertion, the

metal insert (41) wears off a portion (50, 51) of the spring
element (46, 47), which projects into the area for the metal insert

(41), so that, following insertion, the metal insert (41)
is positively and non-positively located between the bearing

surface (45) and the elastically deformed spring element
(46, 47).
Hollow plastic section according to claim 1, 
characterized
in that
 the metal insert (11; 41) has a closed, rectangular 
cross-sectional profile.
Hollow plastic section according to one of the claims 1 to
2, 
characterized in that
 the end face (19; 49) of the metal insert
(11; 41) is bevelled, the face (13; 43) of the metal insert

(11; 41) engaging on the bearing surface (15; 45) projects with
respect to the facing face (22; 52) of the metal insert (11;

41).
Hollow plastic section according to claim 3, 
characterized
in that
 a leading edge (23; 53) of the projecting face (13; 43)
of the metal insert (11; 41) is chamfered and a leading edge

(24; 54) of the facing face (22; 52) of the metal insert (11;
41) is constructed as a cutting edge.
Hollow plastic section according to one of the claims 1 to
4, 
characterized in that
 the metal insert (11; 41) is stiffened
by beads.
Hollow plastic section according to one of the claims 1 to
5, 
characterized in that
 each of the two faces of the metal insert
(11; 41) engages on a bearing surface of two walls to be

stiffened and that along the wall facing the bearing surface is
provided at least one projection or spring element.
Hollow plastic section according to one of the claims 1 to
6, 
characterized in that
 on the side walls (25, 26; 55, 56) of
the cavity (12; 42), which are positioned transversely to the

wall (14, 44) with the bearing surface (15, 45), are constructed
projections (27, 28; 57, 58); which project into the area for

the metal insert (11; 41) and that the metal insert (11; 41) is
positively positioned between the projections (27, 28; 57, 58),

following the wearing off of the parts of the projections (27,
28; 57; 58), which project into the area for the metal insert

(11; 41), and following insertion. 
Hollow plastic section according to one of the claims 1, 6
or 7, 
characterized in that
 the projection (16, 17) is constructed
as a web in the longitudinal direction and its cross-sectional

surface tapers with increasing distance from the wall
(18) on which the web is located.
Hollow plastic section according to one of the claims 1 or 6
to 8, 
characterized in that
 the projection (16, 17) is located
in the corner areas of the cavity (12).
Hollow plastic section according to one of the claims 1, 6
or 7, 
characterized in that
 the spring element (46, 47) is extruded
onto the hollow plastic section (40).
Hollow plastic section according to one of the claims 1, 6,
7 or 10, 
characterized in that
 the spring element (46, 47) is a
web running at least partly in parallel to the bearing surface

(45) and which is provided in its foot area with a cross-sectional
taper (59).
Hollow plastic section according to one of the claims 1, 6,
7, 10 or 11, 
characterized in that
 the spring element (46, 47)
has an L-shaped crosssectional surface.
