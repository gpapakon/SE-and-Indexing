<ABSTRACT>
A roll screen apparatus improved in operation 
and manufacturing. 
The winding up and down of the roll screen are 
effected in such a manner so that the rotation of the 

pully (36) by pulling down of the operation cord (22) is transmitted 
to the screen winding pipe (16), and the stop of the screen is 

effected by disengaging the transmition from the screen 
winding pipe (16) to the pully (36). 
The presented apparatus is characterized by 
providing with a clutch device and a disengagement device. 

The clutch device (40) is only transmissive of the rotation of 
the pully to the screen winding pipe, and the 

disengagement device (54) disconnects the engagement between 
the pully and the screen winding pipe, and maintains such 

disconnected condition.
