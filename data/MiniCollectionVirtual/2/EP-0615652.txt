Vacuum switch having switching contacts which are 
disposed in the housing of an essentially hollow-cylindrical 

vacuum chamber and of which one is designed 
as fixed contact and the other as moving contact, and 

with which a magnet system is associated which is 
disposed outside the housing at the end of the supply 

lead to the fixed contact, characterized in that the 
fixed contact (2), which is designed as flat or disc 

contact, forms the base or the lid of the housing (10) 
and is permeated by the magnetic field (6), whose field 

lines form a toroidal arch whose axis of rotation lies 
in the axis of the cylinder of the vacuum chamber and 

whose circular apex lines have a radius r
s
 which is at 
most as great as the radius r₁ of the smaller of the two 

contacts (2, 4). 
Vacuum switch according to Claim 1, characterized 
in that a magnet system (
20) is provided in which a 
central pole surface is concentrically surrounded by 

another annular-disc-shaped pole surface and in that 
said pole surfaces rest at least indirectly against the 

outside of the fixed contact (2). 
Vacuum switch according to Claim 2, characterized 
in that a magnet system (20) is provided with a magnetic 

circuit containing a central part which extends in the 
axial direction and which is concentrically surrounded 

by an annular concentrator (22). 
Vacuum switch according to Claim 1 having switching 
contacts of which at least one is provided with a 

central contact region (24, 25) surrounded by an erosion 
region (26 and 27, respectively), characterized in that 

the radius r
s
 of the apex line is at least as great as 
the radius r₂ of the contact region (24, 25).  

 
Vacuum switch according to Claim 3, characterized 
in that the magnet system (20) contains at least one 

turn (28) of the supply lead (24) to the fixed contact 
(2), which turn is concentrically surrounded by the 

concentrator (22). 
Vacuum switch according to Claim 1, characterized 
in that the supply lead (14) to the fixed contact (2) is 

concentrically surrounded by a solenoid (32) and an 
annular concentrator (22).
