A process for the preparation of a cyclodextrin-based 
dispersible colloidal system in the form of nanocapsules, 

characterised in that 

1) a liquid phase is prepared, comprising a solution of 
cyclodextrin modified by acyl groups and an oil in an 

organic solvent or mixture of organic solvents selected from 
methanol, ethanol, isopropanol and acetone, optionally 

containing a surfactant and to which an active molecule 
can be added, 
2) a second liquid phase is prepared, comprising water or an 
aqueous mixture, optionally containing a surfactant and to 

which an active molecule can be added, and 
3) one of the liquid phases obtained under (1) or (2) is 
added to the other while stirring gently, that is to say stirring 

sufficiently to homogenise the mixture, so as to obtain 
instantaneously a colloidal suspension of nanocapsules, the 

wall thereof being formed by modified cyclodextrin and the 
cavity consisting of oil optionally containing the active 

molecule. 
A process according to claim 1, characterised in that all or 
part of the solvent or mixture of solvents and the water or 

aqueous mixture is removed so as to obtain a collodial 
suspension of the required concentration of nanocapsules or 

to obtain a nanocapsule powder. 
A process according to claim 1 or 2, characterised in that 
the said solvent of phase (1) is selected from the alcohols 

and the ketones or mixtures thereof.  
 
A process according to claim 1, characterised in that the 
modified cyclodextrin is a betacyclodextrin esterified by 

alkanoyl groups of 2 to 20 carbon atoms. 
A process according to claim 1, characterised in that the 
modified cyclodextrin is a betacyclodextrin esterified by 

alkanoyl groups of 6 to 14 carbon atoms. 
A process according to any one of claims 1 to 5, 
characterised in that the active molecule is a medicinal 

active principle or a medicinal precursor for human or 
veterinary use, a biological reagent or a cosmetic principle, 

a virus, a viral, bacterial or cellular constituent, an antigen, 
an allergen or an enzyme. 
A process according to any one of claims 1 to 6, 
characterised in that the phase (1)/phase (2) volume ratio 

is from 0.1 to 1. 
A process according to claim 2, characterised in that all the 
water is removed by lyophilisation. 
A process according to any one of claims 1 to 8, 
characterised in that the surfactant(s) is (are) present in a 

proportion of 0.1% to 10%, preferably 0.2% to 2% by weight of 
the colloidal suspension obtained in stage (3). 
Use of the modified cyclodextrin nanocapsules obtained 
according to any one of claims 1 to 9 as carriers of 

medicinal or cosmetic active principles. 
Use of the modified cyclodextrin nanocapsules obtained 
according to any one of claims 1 to 9 as a carrier of 

chemical products.
