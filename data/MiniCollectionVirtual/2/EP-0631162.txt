<ABSTRACT>
First and second V-grooves (14, 15) are respectively formed in first and 
second monocrystalline semiconductor elements (11, 12). Aluminum layers (17, 18) 

are formed in the first and second V-grooves, but each aluminum layer extends only 
along a portion of the length of its respective groove. An optical fiber (13) is located 

between the first and second grooves and is heated and compressed between the 
opposite first and second monocrystalline elements, the heat and pressure being 

sufficient to cause bonding between the aluminum layer and the optical fiber. By 
aluminizing only a portion of each groove, rather than its entire length, the 

compressive forces applied to the first and second monocrystalline elements are 
concentrated at the interface of the aluminum layer with the optical fiber. This 

increases the pressure between the optical fiber and the aluminum beyond that which 
would occur if the entire length of the V-grooves were aluminized. As a 

consequence, the bonding is reliable.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to compression bonding methods and, more
particularly, to methods for bonding optical fibers to aluminum coated substrates.Optical communications systems commonly use optical fibers for
carrying very large quantities of information with low distortion and low cost over
great distances. Optical systems are also promising for such purposes as computing
because of the inherently high speed at which they can be operated. For these
reasons, considerable development work has been done on methods for packaging
and connecting optical fibers.For example, the U. S. patent of Bonanni, No. 4,818,058, granted
April 4, 1989, and the U. S. patent of Bonanni et al., No. 4,998,796, granted
March 12, 1991, hereby incorporated herein by reference, describe optical fiber
connectors comprising silicon chips for holding in place a plurality of fibers of an
optical fiber ribbon. Silicon is a monocrystalline material in which small V-grooves
can be very accurately formed by photolithographic masking and etching. Optical
fibers having a typical diameter of one hundred twenty-five microns can be held in
place by matching opposite V-grooves that are each about one hundred microns deep
and one hundred forty microns wide. The matching V-grooves of opposing silicon
chips accurately position the fibers, the fibers being permanently held in place by an
adhesive such as an epoxy.The U. S. patent of Coucoulas, No. 5,178,319, granted January 12, 1993,
hereby incorporated herein by reference, teaches that an optical fiber can be bonded
within the V-groove of a silicon substrate by coating the V-groove with aluminum
and applying heat and pressure. The resulting thermo-compression bond can
securely contain the optical fiber within the V-groove, thus avoiding the need for an
adhesive, which may contaminate other elements of a photonics package. It would
appear that the Coucoulas invention could be routinely applied to the connector
packages of Bonanni et al. so as to avoid the adhesive required in making the
connectors described in the Bonanni patents. Experience has shown, however, that
when the V-grooves of a connector such as that described in the Bonanni patents are
aluminized, and the opposite silicon elements are compressed against heated optical
fibers to make the bond, the resulting bond is sometimes not reliable. It appears that 
certain of the optical fibers are not sufficiently compressed into the aluminum
coating to make a satisfactory bond, and the force needed to give reliable bonding
along the lengths of
