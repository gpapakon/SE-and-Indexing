<ABSTRACT>
An icon is displayed on a display screen of an information processing 
system both at the time of entering a hibernation mode and at the time 

of exiting it. 
A block of main memory data and a block of VRAM data are divided and 
separately controlled. When the system enters a hibernation mode, the 

original data of the VRAM is stored first, followed by storing the 
original data of the main memory while displaying an icon. In addition, 

in the wake-up mode, the original data in the main memory is restored 
while displaying an icon, followed by restoring the original data of the 

VRAM.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to information processing systems that
operate with a low power consumption, and more particularly to a
portable information processing system such as a notebook computer.As a result of recent technological innovation, small-size and light-weight
portable computers have become common. When such portable
computers are used outdoors, electric power is supplied to them with
batteries. However batteries mounted on portable computers are
restricted to small-size batteries. Thus the period for which personal
computers can be operated without recharging the batteries is short.
Consequently various kinds of facilities or devices are provided for
reducing the consumption of power in many portable computers.A suspend/resume function is one of such facilities. When the
suspend/resume function operates, the computer enters into a suspend
mode. This may be in response to a situation such as no activity of an
I/O device being detected for a certain time. In the suspend mode all
tasks are suspended, and the main memory saves data required later for
resuming the tasks. In the suspend mode, the main memory and the video
memory (VRAM) are powered on, but CPU or the like are powered off.
However, portable computers have a drawback in that the power of
batteries are consumed when the suspend mode continues for a very long
time with only the support of the suspend/resume function. This can
result in the contents of the memory and the VRAM being erased.Therefore portable computers which are supported with hibernation mode,
such as the LTE Lite/25 manufactured by Compaq Company (Compaq and LTE
are registered trademarks of Compaq Computer Corporation) have been
proposed and marketed. When hibernation mode is enabled, the computer
enters a low battery-use state. Otherwise, when the suspend mode
continues for a certain time, the computers enter hibernation mode after 
saving onto the hard disk all the data required later for resuming the
task. In hibernation mode, the whole system, including the memory and
the VRAM, is powered off. When users power on the system later, the data
stored in the hard disk is restored in the memory and the VRAM and the
tasks which had been suspended are automatically resumed. The series of
operation accompanying power-on is also referred to as wake-up.In the hibernation/wake-up operation, a hard disk device accesses a
hard disk by means of a head. It is necessary to notify the user of the
fact that the system is in the midst of a hibernation or wake-up.A system is

<CLAIMS>
An information processing system including a CPU (10), a volatile main
memory (12), a volatile video memory (58), a non-volatile external storage device (68,70),

and a display device (66), and supporting a hibernation function by which,
upon the occurrence of predetermined conditions the contents of said

main memory (12) and said volatile video memory (58) are saved to said non-volatile external storage
device (68,70) before said system is powered off, said information processing

system comprising:

(a) means for saving the contents of said video memory to said
external storage device;
(b) means for writing icon data to display an icon on a screen of
said display device after the contents of said video memory

has been saved; and
(c) means for saving the contents of said main memory to said
external device while said icon is being displayed, a block

of said main memory contents and a block of said video memory
contents being managed separately in said external storage

device;

said information processing system further supporting a wake-up function
by which a task that has been suspended is resumed by

restoring the contents of said main memory and the contents
of said video memory from said external storage device in

response to the power-on of said system in the hibernation
mode, said information processing system further comprising:
(d) means for writing data for icon display in said video memory
and displaying an icon on the screen of said display;
(e) means for restoring said main memory contents from said
external storage device while displaying said icon; and
(f) means for restoring said video memory contents from said
external storage device after the restoration of said main

memory contents is complete.
An information processing system according to claim 1, wherein 
address information on the block of said main memory contents and address

information on the block of said video memory contents is stored in a
predetermined region of said external storage device.
An information processing system according to claim 1 or claim 2,
wherein a ROM in said system preliminarily stores data on an image

occupying a small region on said screen, whereas said means (b) and/or
means (d) generates data on an image occupying a larger region on said

screen.
An information processing system according to any one of the
preceding claims, wherein said means (b) includes means for accessing

said video memory to rewrite the contents thereof, thereby changing an
icon image while contents in said main memory are being 
saved to said
external storage device.
An information processing system according to any one of the preceeding claims,
wherein said means (d) includes means for accessing said video

memory to rewrite the contents thereof thereby changing an icon image,
while the contents in said external storage device are restored in said

main memory.
An information processing system according to any one of the
preceding claims wherein the block of the main memory and the block of

the VRAM data are divided for management.
A method for executing a hibernational function and a wake-up
function, in an information processing system including a CPU (10), a volatile

main memory (12), a volatile video memory (58), a non-volatile external storage

predetermined conditions, the contents of said volatile main memory (12) and the
contents of said volatile video memory (58) are saved in said non-volatile external storage device (68,70)

before the whole system is powered off thereby entering a hibernation
mode and upon occurrence of other conditions a task that has been

suspended is resumed in response to power-on of the system in hibernation
mode, by restoring the contents of said volatile main memory (12) and the contents of

said volatile video memory (58) from said non-volatile external storage device (68,70), said method
comprising a store operation for entering a hibernation mode including

(a) saving the contents of said video memory in said external
storage device;
(b) writing in said video memory data for icon

displaying an icon on the screen of said display;
(e) restoring the contents of said main memory to said external
