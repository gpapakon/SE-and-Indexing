<ABSTRACT>
The invention concerns a resonant power control 
circuit particularly for lighting which is capable of 

operating either in a "Buck" mode in which the output 
voltage is lower than the input voltage or a "Boost" 

mode in which the output voltage is higher than the 
input voltage.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a power control circuit 
which is particularly, though not exclusively, suited 
to use in light dimming systems. Such systems can be 
used in theatres and television or film studios. Television and film studios require high power light 
sources (often mobile) for selective illumination of 
particular characters, as do live entertainment venues 
such as theatres. It is necessary to be able to 
control the level of illumination, both to provide a 
constant predetermined level and for providing fade-in 
and fade-out effects. The control circuit for 
controlling the level of illumination is known as the 
"dimmer". In the past, dimmers using autotransformers, that is 
transformers with a sweep connector to vary the number 
of turns on the secondary coil, have been used. 
Typically, the AC mains supply would be connected to 
the primary coils of a bank of such transformers, each 
secondary coil being individually connected to a  
 
separate light. However, each transformer occupied 
considerable space and was cumbersome to use. Alternative dimmer structures used variable resistors 
(rheostats) which are smaller, but these generate 
considerable heat because of the high current through 
the resistance of the coils. A bank of such rheostats 
therefore generated a large amount of heat, leading to 
the need for cooling, and to potential mechanical 
reliability problems. In recent years, it has become known to use phase 
control as a method of controlling AC power. In phase 
control systems, a semiconductor switch switches the 
AC supply voltage on once each half-cycle. By 
controlling the timing at which the semiconductor 
element switches on, the proportion of the mains cycle 
gated through the semiconductor element, and hence the 
average power of the output, is controlled. The 
components of the phase control dimmer are relatively 
cheap, and do not involve mechanical movement. 
Further, the phase controlled dimmer is controllable 
from a low voltage source such as the output of a 
micro-computer, making it possible to digitally  
 
control the light level. Phase control dimmers have 
found application in power control in general, and in 
most lighting control applications. However, major 
problems arise in some applications. Because the 
semiconductor switch gates the AC mains supply voltage 
in a series of sharp steps, much of the power in the 
output is contained in harmonics of the mains 
frequency. The magnitude of the harmonics varies with 
the time of switching of the

a resonant circuit (L1,L2,C1,C2) including switch means 
(S1,S2) and characterised in that it is capable of 

operating both in a first mode in which it delivers a 
controllable output voltage to a load which is higher 

than the input voltage, and a second mode in which it 
provides controlled attenuation of the input supply. 
A power converter as claimed in claim 1 and for use 
with an AC power supply. 
A circuit as claimed in claim 1 or claim 2 and
