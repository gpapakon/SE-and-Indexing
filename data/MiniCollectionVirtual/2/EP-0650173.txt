<ABSTRACT>
A three-phase autotransformer (1) improving 
balance of three-phase voltages and currents. An 

iron core (3) has three legs (3a, 3b and 3c) 
corresponding to the three phase. A common winding 

(19, 20 and 21, 22, 23 and 24, or 25, 26 and 29) 
and/or a serial winding (10, 11 and 12, 13, 14 and 

15, or 16, 17 and 18) of each phase includes three 
coils. Two of the three coils are wound on the same 

leg associated with the phase of the coils, and the 
other one coil is wound on another leg. The two 

coils and the other one coil are connected in series 
to generate magnetic flux in the opposite 

directions. Since the common winding and/or the 
series winding includes coils which are wound on 

different legs associated with different phases, and 
which generate flux in opposite directions, the 

balance of three-phase input voltages and currents, 
and output voltages and currents is automatically 

maintained.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a three-phase 
autotransformer, and particularly to a three-phase 
autotransformer with a balancing function which can 
eliminate imbalance between voltages and currents of 
the three phases, thereby improving efficiency of 
electric apparatuses connected to the 
autotransformer. When a conventional three-phase autotransformer 
is used to supply power to various electric 
apparatuses connected to its output, imbalance 
between the three phases may occur. Fig. 1 is a diagram for illustrating mechanism 
that causes the imbalance. Three-phase output 
terminals of a distribution transformer 101 are 
connected, through distribution lines 102U, 102V and 
102W, to the input terminals U, V and W of a three-phase 
autotransformer 103 including three-phase 
windings 103U, 103V and 103W which are star-connected. 
One end of each winding is connected to 
the neutral point N, which in turn is connected to 
the neutral point of the distribution transformer 
101 through a distribution line 102N. Three-phase 
output terminals u, v and w are brought out of the 
windings, and an induction motor M is connected to 
the output terminals. In addition, an electric  
 
heater H is connected between the neutral point N 
and the output terminal v. The U-phase winding 103U 
consists of a common winding from the neutral point 
N to the output terminal u, and a series winding 
from the output terminal u to the input terminal U. 
Likewise, each of the windings 103V and 103W 
consists of a common winding from the neutral point 
to the output terminal, and a series winding from 
the output terminal to the input terminal. With this connection, although the induction 
motor M will keep balance of the three phases, the 
electric heater H may disturb it, thus causing 
differences in voltages and currents between the 
phases. In the case of Fig. 1, for example, the 
current of the V-phase is greater than the currents 
of the other phases, which will cause a voltage drop 
due to a resistance of the distribution line 102V of 
the V-phase. Thus, imbalance between voltages will 
occur as well as the imbalance between currents. 
The imbalance will have various harmful effects on 
electric apparatuses connected to the transformer. 
For example, the torque of the induction motor M may 
be reduced, and its efficiency may be decreased 
owing to an increase in the slip. In addition, the 
windings of the induction motor may be overheated, 
thereby shortening its life. It is therefore an object of the present 
invention
