<ABSTRACT>
It is impossible, using known devices for measuring analog telephony 
signals, to measure telephony traffic in real time. The device according to the 

invention comprises a processor which may be in various states and which, for 
each state, is able to generate different mask conditions by means of which a 

certain number of stored digital samples of the analog telephony signals can 
be tested for certain properties without the risk of tolerances, inherently 

present in analog telephony traffic, affecting these tests. As a result of the 
processor being able to be in various states, a state being a criterion of a 

particular previous and/or subsequent history, the particular number of stored 
digital samples required for a test with a mask condition may remain 

relatively small, which provides for actual real-time measuring.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a device for measuring analog telephony 
signals, provided with 
a converter, which can be linked to a subscriber line, for converting analog 
voltages present on the subscriber line into digital samples, a memory, linked to the converter, for storing a number of digital samples, a processor linked to the memory. A device of this type is disclosed by EP 0 200 038 B1. The device 
described herein measures analog voltages which are present on the line of a 
digital telephony system by converting these analog voltages, by means of the 
converter, into digital samples which are then stored in the memory. The 
processor checks, for each new sample, whether this is larger than the largest 
previously stored sample, in which case the previously stored sample is 
replaced by the new larger sample, or whether this is smaller than the 
smallest previously stored sample, in which case, likewise, the previously 
stored sample is replaced by the new smaller sample. Thus, after a certain 
time interval, a maximum and a minimum are found which form the actual 
maximum and minimum of all the samples taken during the particular time 
interval, and from which, based on a mathematical formula, new values are 
derived. A known device of this type has the drawback that it is designed in 
principle for locating faults, and that it is in principle unsuitable for real-time 
measuring of analog telephony traffic. It presents the problem that the 
determination of the actual maximum and minimum during the particular 
time interval is completely inadequate for analysing and interpreting very 
complex analog telephony traffic (involving ringing pulses, dialling pulses  
 
and billing pulses subject to considerable tolerances and, in general, pulses 
which look identical at first sight but may have a different previous and/or 
subsequent history). One of the objects of the invention is to provide a device of the type 
stated in the preamble, by means of which it is possible to analyse and 
interpret analog telephony traffic in real time. To this end, the device according to the invention is characterized in 
that the processor is designed for 
being able to be in at least two states, generating, for each state, at least one mask condition, and checking whether at least a part of the number of stored digital samples 
satisfies this mask condition. As a result of the processor being able to be in at least two states, it is 
capable of interpreting differently two pulses which look identical to one 
another
