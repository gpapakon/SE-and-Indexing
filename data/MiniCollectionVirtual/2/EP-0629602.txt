<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to chalcone 
derivatives and a pharmaceutical preparation containing one 
of the chalcone derivatives. In particular, it relates to 
3,4-dihydroxychalcone derivatives and an anti-inflammatory 
preparation containing one of the 3,4-dihydroxychalcone 
derivatives. It is known that 3,4-dihydroxychalcone and its 
derivatives have the activity to inhibit the oxidation of 
edible oils [Food Chemistry (1983, 12) 205 - 212]. JP,A 61-76433 discloses that 3-(3,4-dihydroxyphenyl)-1-(2,3,4-trimethoxyphenyl)-2-propen-1-one 
[= 3,4-(2',3',4'-trimethoxy)dihydroxychalcone] has 
antiallergic activity, and JP-A-2-256611 discloses that 
2',4',3,4-tetrahydroxychalcone has extensive anti-inflammatory 
activity. Further, although based on in vitro experimental 
results, it has been revealed that 3,4-dihydroxychalcone and 
3,4-dihydroxychalcone derivatives such as 2',3,4-trihydroxychalcone, 
4',3,4-trihydroxychalcone and 
2',4',3,4-tetrahydroxychalcone have the inhibiting activity 
against enzymes which are to cause inflammation 
[PROSTAGLADINS (1985, 30 (3) 357)]. As described above, studies are now under way 
concerning the activities of a variety of 3,4-dihydroxychalcone 
derivatives.  
 It is a first object of the present invention to 
provide novel 3,4-dihydroxychalcone derivatives useful as 
pharmaceutical materials. It is a second object of the present invention to 
provide a novel anti-inflammatory preparation. According to the present invention, the above 
first object of the present invention is achieved by novel 
3,4-dihydroxychalcone derivatives which are compounds of the 
formula (I), 
 
   wherein X is a substituted phenyl group 
represented by the formula (i), 
 
in which R1 is a hydrogen atom or an alkyl group 
and R2 is an alkyl group, an alkoxy group or an 
-OH group (excluding an OH-group in the 3- or 4-position), 
the formula (ii), 
 
in which R3 is an alkyl group, an alkoxy group or 
a dimethylamino group, 
the formula (iii),  
 
 
in which each of R4 and R5 is an alkyl group and 
R6 is a hydrogen atom or an alkyl group, or 
the formula (iv). 
 
in which R7 is an alkoxy group, R8 is a hydrogen 
atom or an alkyl group and R9 is a hydrogen atom 
or an alkoxy group, 
or salts thereof. Further, according to the present invention, the 
above second object of the present invention is achieved by 
an anti-inflammatory preparation containing one of the above 
3,4-dihydroxychalcone derivatives as an active ingredient. The present inventors have made diligent studies 
of
