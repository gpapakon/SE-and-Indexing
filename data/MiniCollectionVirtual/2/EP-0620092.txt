<ABSTRACT>
2.1 Bodies having a microstructure are moulded by means of a mould insert, produced for example by the LIGA process. The process is in many cases complex. The structural forms which can be achieved are limited. When selecting the materials, a compromise has to be made between the requirements in the production process and the requirements during use of the bodies having a microstructure. 2.2 The microstructured mould insert is produced from a solid body (metal, ceramic, glass, stone or monocrystalline material) by precision machining, additive or subtractive structuring. The mould insert is filled with a flowable material and covered; the solidified material is separated from the mould insert, the body having a microstructure being obtained. For producing the mould insert, a material which has properties making it as suitable as possible for these structuring processes is chosen. For the body having a microstructure, materials which optimally meet the requirements demanded of the said body are selected. 2.3 Production of bodies having a microstructure with optimum material properties and in an extended variety of forms.
