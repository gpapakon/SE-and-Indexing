<ABSTRACT>
Sunscreen compositions comprising from about 0.5 % to about 30 % by weight of a metal oxide which is titanium dioxide, zinc oxide or a mixture of both these oxides and from about 0.001 % to about 2 % by weight of iron oxide particles having a mean primary particle size of less than about 200 nm are described. The metal oxide may be substantially in the form of particles having a mean primary particle size of less than about 100 nm. The preferred form of iron oxide is iron (III) oxide. Optionally, either the metal oxide or the iron oxide particles or both are coated with a phospholipid such as lecithin. The sunscreen compositions may include phosphate anions. Sunscreen compositions comprising the above ingredients in both oil-in-water and water-in-oil emulsions are also disclosed.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to the use of iron 
oxide particles in sunscreen compositions. The term 
"sunscreen" is used herein to encompass tanning lotions, 
sunscreens and sunblockers which are intended for use on 
the body to provide protection against the sun's rays or 
other UV sources. The use of titanium dioxide as a sunscreening agent 
is well known. The amount of titanium dioxide present 
in a sunscreen composition depends on the use for which 
the composition is intended. Amounts as low as 1% may 
be sufficient in the so-called suntanning products which 
are not intended to prevent the sun's rays reaching the 
skin whereas the so-called sunblocks which are intended 
to prevent substantially all of the sun's rays reaching 
the skin may require levels of 15 to 20%. It has been 
found that when the amount of titanium dioxide in the 
sunscreen composition exceeds 5% the composition 
exhibits a blue-white pearl effect which is 
aesthetically unattractive and limits the amount of 
titanium dioxide which can be incorporated into a 
sunscreen composition which is acceptable to the user. Use of zinc oxide as a sunscreening agent is also 
well known, either on its own or combined with titanium 
dioxide. Hereinafter, throughout the specification and 
claims the term 'metal oxide' is defined as a metal 
oxide consisting of titanium dioxide only, zinc oxide 
only, or a mixture of both these oxides. In preferred 
sunscreen compositions of the present invention the 
metal oxide is titanium dioxide only.  
 Pigment grade iron oxides of coarse particle size 
have been used in sunscreen compositions as tinting 
agents, typically at a level of 5% w/w, to mask the 
blue-white pearl effect. However, such compositions 
suffer from the disadvantage that the iron oxide tinting 
agent rubs off in use and may cause unacceptable 
discolouration or staining of clothing. Surprisingly we have found that the use of iron 
oxide of a particular particle size may be used in 
sunscreen formulations at comparatively low levels 
therefore minimising unacceptable rub off yet permitting 
the use of comparatively high levels of titanium dioxide 
without the disadvantage of an unacceptable blue-white 
pearl. British Patent Application 2,243,780A (Unilever) 
and European Patent Application 456458 (Unilever) 
describe cosmetic compositions comprising microfine 
titanium dioxide (particle size 1 to 100 nm) as an 
inorganic sunscreen. Both these documents contain a 
passing reference to the optional use of iron oxide of 
particle size
