<ABSTRACT>
A fuel injection pump of the distributor design for a multi-cylinder internal combustion engine has one pump piston (13) which rotates and is simultaneously driven in the lifting direction in order to produce a fuel injection pressure in a pump working space (17) and, for determining the start and end of injection, a solenoid valve (18) which shuts off and opens the pump working space (17) with respect to a pressure relief channel (19). The rotary movement of the pump piston (13) is produced by a drive shaft (15) and its lifting movement is produced by a cam transmission (14). In order to use the fuel injection pump in an internal combustion engine which has more than four cylinders, the cam transmission (14) has a first eccentric disc (26) which is fixed in terms of rotation to the pump piston (13) and has end cams (31), and a second eccentric disc (27) which is fixed in terms of rotation to a drive shaft (15) and has end cams (32). A non-rotatable but axially displaceably secured roller holder (30) bears running rollers (28, 29) which each run on one of the eccentric discs (26, 27).

Fuel injection pump of the distributor type for a 
multi-cylinder internal combustion engine, with a number 

of injection conduits (24) corresponding to the number of 
cylinders of the internal combustion engine, with a pump 

piston (13) which delimits a pump working space (17) and 
which, by axial lifting movement, generates a fuel 

injection pressure in the pump working space (17) and 
connects the latter to one of the injection conduits (24) 

in succession as a result of rotational movement, with a 
rotating drive shaft (15) which is coupled to the pump 

piston (13) fixedly in terms of rotation and in a way 
allowing the axial lifting movement of the latter, with 

a cam mechanism (14; 14') for the axial drive of the pump 
piston (13) in the lifting direction, the said cam 

mechanism having a lifting disc (26), which is connected 
to the pump piston (13) fixedly in terms of rotation and 

carries a number of face cams (31) corresponding to the 
number of cylinders of the internal combustion engine, 

and at least one running roller (28) rolling on the face 
cams (31) of the lifting disc (26) and held rotatably in 

a non-rotatable roller holder (30), with a relief duct 
(19) connected to the pump working space (17), and with 

a solenoid valve (18) which controls the relief duct (19) 
and which determines the start of feed of the pump piston 

(13) with the shutting of the relief duct (19) and the 

end of feed of the pump piston (13) with the opening of 
the relief duct (19), characterized in that a second 

lifting disc (27) carrying an equal number of face cams 
(32) is connected to the drive shaft (15) fixedly in  

 
terms of rotation, in that at least one second running 

roller (29) rolling on the face cams (32) of the second 
lifting disc (27) is held rotatably in the roller holder 

(30), and in that the roller holder (30) is guided 
axially displaceably. 
Pump according to Claim 1, characterized in that 
the two lifting discs (26, 27) are equal in diameter, and 

in that the axes of the first and second running rollers 
(28, 29) are offset relative to one another in the axial 

direction of the roller holder (30). 
Pump according to Claim 2, characterized in that 
the axial spacing of the axes of the first and second 

running rollers (28, 29) is smaller than their diameter, 
and the axes of the first and second running rollers (28, 

29) are rotated radially relative to one another to such 
an extent that the running rollers (28, 29) do not touch 

one another. 
Pump according to Claim 1, characterized in that 
the diameter of the first lifting disc (26) connected 

fixedly in terms of rotation to the pump piston (13) is 
smaller than the diameter of the second lifting disc (27) 

connected fixedly in terms of rotation to the drive shaft 
(15), and in that the first and second running rollers 

(28, 29) are arranged with radially aligned axes one 
behind the other. 
Pump according to one of Claims 1 to 4, characterized 
in that altogether four first running rollers 

(28) rolling on the first lifting disc (26) connected 
fixedly in terms of rotation to the pump piston (13) and 

four second running rollers (29) rolling on the second 
lifting disc (27) connected fixedly in terms of rotation 

to the drive shaft (15) are arranged in the roller holder 
(30).
