<ABSTRACT>
Detection of microorganisms by first isolating them from the sample by means of antibodies and a solid support for the antibodies and then, optionally after isolation of the DNA from the bound microorganisms, carrying out a PCR. The antibodies to be used are specific for the microorganisms to be detected and most preferably generated against still living microorganisms. Especially magnetic particles are suitable as solid support. In PCR, primers are used that are specific for the microorganisms to be detected, most preferably based on an rRNA sequence or a DNA replication origin sequence.

<DESCRIPTION>
 Title: Method and kit for demonstrating microorganismsThis invention relates to a method and a kit for demonstrating microorganisms in a sample.In clinical samples (suchs as urine, feces, saliva, sputum, serum, blood, biopten and the like) or in foods potentially pathogenic species of bacteria may be present in small numbers among large numbers of contaminating other species of microorganisms. These potentially pathogenic bacteria are demonstrated by using selective media. Thus, the classical method of demonstrating Salmonella consists in a culture on Salmonella/Shigella agar and enrichment in selenite agar, followed by a biochemical and seriological identification. This classical method has substantial deficiencies, especially the fact that it requires much time and is labor-intensive. U.S. patent 4,677,055 discloses a variant of this classical method wherein the microorganisms to be determined are first isolated from the sample. According to this variant a biological medium in which pathogenic microorganisms with a specific antigenic determinant are present is contacted with a magnetic gel to which antibodies directed against this determinant are coupled. The magnetic particles are then picked up with a magnetic rod and inoculated on an agar plate to form an imprint of about 1 cm in cross-section. The agar plate is incubated so that colonies (as large as the imprint) can be formed. Then, e.g., a classical bacteriological method can be used to identify the bacteria in the colony.In the meantime, there have also been developed methods of determination wherein the presence of a certain type of bacteria, e.g., Salmonella, in clinical samples or foods is demonstrated with an enzyme immunoassay or an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (E ISA) using polyclonal or monoclonal antibodies. Such determinations take one or two days less, but yet the samples to be examined must first be enriched in a growth medium before the actual assay can be carried out. Besides, the immunochemical detection has the further 

 drawbacks that it is hard to distinguish related microorganisms with antisera and that no better sensitivity than 106 cells/ml can be realized.The above U.S. patent 4,677,055 also discloses an 5 -uπmunological technique of determining the identity of the bacteria. For this purpose a recess is made in the agar at a short distance from the colonies, which recess is filled with a specific antiserum. The colonie are lysed. Diffusion of antigen from the colony and antibody from the recess filled 0 with
