<ABSTRACT>
2-acetylpyridine is administered by inhalation to a person needing to 
suppress the desire to smoke or otherwise ingest tobacco or tobacco 

related products. The 2-acetylpyridine is preferably used in an amount of 
from about 12 ml to about 20 ml per liter of propylene glycol solvent. 

An inhaler device can be used to administer the 2-acetylpyridine.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a novel means of suppressing the desire 
to smoke tobacco or tobacco related products. An appetite-suppressant 
inhaler is disclosed in my U.S. Patent 4,521,427. Aids to stop smoking are well known. Most of these are taken 
orally, but some utilize a "transdermal" delivery system, i.e. the "nicotine 
patch", or an attempt is made to modify behaviour through either 
hypnosis or group therapy. Some aids are temporary, ineffective under 
certain conditions, and can be harmful to the user. It is a general object of this invention to provide a smoking 
suppressant that is effective yet extremely easy to use. A specific object is to provide such a smoking suppressant 
which can be inhaled. Another object is to provide the smoking suppressant in varying 
degrees of odor intensity so as to effect specific levels or types of 
behaviour modification or maintenance. The present invention resides in the use of 2-acetylpyridine for 
the manufacture of an inhalable composition for suppressing the desire to 
smoke or otherwise ingest tobacco or tobacco related products. 
Inhalation of 2-acetylpyridine in an effective amount stimulates the 
olfactory bulb which has a direct connection to the ventromedial nucleus 
of the hypothalamus. This is the area within the hypothalamus that is 
known as the "satiety center", the cerebral apparatus that triggers the 
sensation of satisfaction or gratification. Fenaroli's Handbook of Flavor Ingredients specifies that 2-Acetylpyridine's  
 
"organoleptic characteristic" is that of a tobacco-like 
aroma. The direct connection between the olfactory bulb and the 
ventromedial nucleus of the hypothalamus is the medium by which that 
tobacco-like aroma, or "organoleptic sense impression" is transmitted 
from the olfactory receptor to that part of the satiety centre that gratifies 
and/or satisfies the desire to smoke. The "organoleptic characteristic" 
elicits the "organoleptic effect" or response. In other words, it tricks the 
brain into thinking it has had enough, or more than enough of smoking, 
thereby suppressing or controlling the desire to smoke. Preferably, the 2-acetylpyridine is dissolved or dispersed in a 
pharmaceutically acceptable solvent or other diluent. More preferably, it 
is dissolved in propylene glycol, preferably in an amount of 12 to 20ml 
per litre of propylene glycol. Preferably, the 2-acetylpyridine and solvent are contained in an 
inhaler device. Preferably, the 2-acetylpyridine in propylene glycol has an odor 
intensity range
