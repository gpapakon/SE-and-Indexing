<ABSTRACT>
A method for controlling oxygen deposition on steel 
sheets. The oxygen deposition value of a steel sheet 

measured after decarburization annealing remains at a 
constant value by controlling, in the decarburization 

annealing line for the steel sheet, the electrolytic 
electricity density in electrolytic degreasing equipment 

included in the decarburization annealing line.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method of
controlling oxygen deposition in decarburization
annealing lines on anisotropic electromagnetic steel
sheets, and more particularly relates to a method for
precisely applying a target oxygen deposition value to a
steel sheet.The purpose of a decarburization annealing process
for anisotropic electromagnetic steel sheets is to
decarburize steel sheets to prevent magnetic aging of
final products, and also form an oxide film (mainly
consisting of SiO2 and Fe2SiO4) necessary for producing a
vitreous film during finish annealing that is then
conducted under application of an annealing separation
agent. Oxide film greatly influences the behavior of
secondary recrystallization during final annealing.
Hence, oxide film affects magnetic characteristics of the
final product and greatly influences the quality of the
vitreous film formed on the surface of the final product.
Therefore, the amount of oxide film produced must be 
strictly controlled.Oxygen deposition is usually employed as a component
of the total amount of the oxide film produced. Several
methods for properly controlling oxygen deposition have
heretofore been proposed. For example, Japanese Patent
Laid-Open No. JP-A-3-122221 proposes a method by which
components of atmospheric gas on the delivery side of a
decarburization annealing furnace are compared with those
on the supply side, and the amount of H2O in the supply
gas is changed in accordance with the measured
difference. Also, Japanese Patent Laid-Open No. JP-A-4-337033
proposes a method by which an estimated value of oxygen
deposition is determined in a regression manner based on
the dew point in an annealing furnace, the sheet
temperature and the soaking time, then the dew point of
atmospheric gas is changed so that the estimated value
coincides with a target value.The above-described prior art methods, however,
require monitoring either atmospheric gas or sheet
temperature to maintain oxygen deposition at a predetermined
value, which creates response lags lasting
several tens of minutes or more. Accordingly, none of
the prior art methods provide a quick system response
necessary to maintain constant oxygen deposition during
abrupt changes in the surface roughness of the steel
sheet, variations in cold rolling conditions of the 
preceding step, etc. Additionally, long lag times exist
in the prior art between implementation of corrective
measures and re-establishment of the target oxygen
deposition value.With a view to solving the problems described
