<ABSTRACT>
The device (40) for the band metal shearing of flat structures (6) has a punching plate (4) and a punching mould (7) which is situated opposite the latter. The punching mould has an assembly plate (8) which is penetrated by band metal cutters (9, 11). The punching mount adjoins a closing frame (14). To compensate for the differences in the height of the band metal cutters (9, 11) during the cutting process, an elastic film (41) having a minimum hardness of 60 Shore A and a minimum thickness of 50  mu m is arranged on the surface (44) of the punching mould (7) facing away from the cutting edge.
