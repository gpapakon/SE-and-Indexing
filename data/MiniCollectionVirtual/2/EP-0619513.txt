<ABSTRACT>
The present invention is directed to an apparatus 
and an associated method for achieving alignment between an 

image on a film and a lenticular material that is to be 
bonded to the film to permit the image to be viewed in 3D. 

The apparatus imparts a controlled bending of the lenticular 
material over the film such that the slight differences in 

length between the lenticular material and the film, caused 
by the bending, adjusts for changes in the line spacing of 

the lenticular material and or in the spacing of the image 
segments. Other embodiments of the invention provide for a 

controlled stretching of the film along its length and from 
side-to-side to again compensate for variations in the line 

spacing of the lenticular material or spacing of the image 
segments.

<DESCRIPTION>
The field of this invention relates to the
alignment of preprinted film to lenticular material.Kodak is one of the first companies to produce and
introduce 3D imagery where the image is bonded to a
lenticular material after the image is printed. U. S. patent
application serial No. 885,411 entitled "A Method of
Adapting Scan Print Images with Lenticular Face Plates" by
Roy Taylor,
published 26 December 1995 as US 5 479 270 A, which does not
belong to the prior art according to Article 54 EPC, and
corresponding to EP 0 570 807 A, published 24 November 1993, and
belonging to the prior art according to Article 54(3)(4) EPC,
addresses this architecture. A key element of
laminating lenticular material to a developed image on film
is the obtaining of an accurate alignment between the film
image and the lenticular material. This element has been
covered in U. S. patent application serial No. 885,699
entitled "Electronically Printed Integral Photography
System" by Roy Taylor and Sergei Fogel, published 11 January
1994 as US 5 278 608 A, which does not belong to the prior art
according to Article 54 EPC, and corresponding to EP 0 570 809
A, published 24 November 1993, and belonging to the prior art
according to Article 54(3)(4) EPC.Our experience with laminating film to lenticular
material indicates however that there can be variations in
the spacing of lens elements from one piece of lenticular
material to another or in the spacing of image elements from
one piece of film to another. Variations in lenticular
material can arise from variations in shrinkage (lenticular
material has a typical shrinkage after molding of 0.1% to 1%
of the
material size). While the average value of this shrinkage
can be predicted and compensated for, variations in the
shrinkage from piece to piece of the lenticular material or 
variations in the shrinkage of the film which is matched
against the lenticular material may cause a significant loss
of image quality.The scale of allowable variations may be quite
small. For example, an image which is 10'' wide and has 70
lenticules per inch with 15 views per lenticule, has 10,500
views across its width. For the highest image quality the
maximum allowable misregistration is plus or minus half a
view allowing a differential shrinkage between the
lenticular material and the film must be kept to plus or
minus 0.005%.(As already indicated, lenticular materials
typically shrink in the range of 0.1% to 1%. Based on the
considerations already referred, maximum allowable shrinkage
variation must be

Apparatus for aligning and scaling images of a film member
relative to a lenticular member (203 ; 301), the

lenticular member being provided to lie on the top of the
film member (204 ; 302) characterized in that it

comprises :

means (210-216 ; 303) for mechanically
and selectively changing the local scale of one member

relative to the other; and
optical means (112-201 ; 206-305) for observing,
by means of alignment marks provided along an edge of the film member,

the degree of alignment of the film member and the
lenticular member as the scale is changed to identify the

achievement of a desired degree of alignment.
The apparatus according to Claim 1, further
comprising means for providing a relative displacement of the

film member with respect to the lenticular member.
The apparatus according to Claim 2 wherein said
means for providing relative displacement of the film with

respect to the lenticular material is comprised of:

clamping means (207, 208) affixed to
each end of the film for providing a stretch to the film.
The apparatus according to Claim 3 wherein said
clamping means is further comprised of: 


means (210-213) for imparting a differential stretching of
the film to correct for misalignments along an axis

transverse to the direction of stretch.
The apparatus according to any of claims 1 to 4,
further comprising means for affixing one end of the film and

the lenticular member in alignment with respect to each
other.

comprising:


means for bonding the lenticular material to the
film.
Method for aligning and scaling images of a film member
(204; 302) to a

lenticular member (203; 301) comprising the steps of:

a) placing the lenticular member (203; 301) in surface contact
with the film member (204; 302);
b) observing the alignment of the members;

characterized in that said method further comprises the steps
of:
c) mechanically and selectively changing the local
scale of one member relative to the other member if the

alignment is not acceptable; and
d)

302) to
optically observe the degree of alignment of

the film member and the lenticular member as the scale is
changed to identify the achievement of a desired degree of

alignment.

Claim 7 wherein the scale of the members is changed by

stretching at least one of the members.
The method for aligning images according to
claim 7 or 8 and further comprising the step of bonding
