Method for recognizing the knocking of an internal-combustion 
engine, in which the signal of a knock 

sensor is digitized and fed to a signal processor, 
characterized in that the signal of the knock sensor is 

high-pass-filtered, and this high-frequency signal is 
compared with a first pressure threshold (P1) in such a 

way that the number of amplitudes of the high-frequency 
signal which exceed the first pressure threshold (P1) is 

counted, and this number is compared with a predetermined 
number, and in that the high-pass-filtered signal is 

subsequently integrated on and the signal thus obtained 
is compared with a second predetermined limit value (P2), 

knocking combustion being recognized when the number of 
amplitudes of the high-frequency signal which exceed the 

first pressure threshold is higher than the predetermined 
number, and when the second limit value (P2) is exceeded 

by the integrated-on signal. 
Method according to Claim 1, characterized in 
that the signals of the knock sensor are obtained as a 

pressure trend of the cylinder internal pressure of an 
internal-combustion engine. 
Method according to one of the preceding claims, 
characterized in that the second limit value (P2) is an 

absolute value of the energy content of the pressure 
vibrations. 
Method according to one of the preceding claims, 
characterized in that the comparison operation is carried 

out within a measurement window. 
Method according to Claim 4, characterized in  
 

that the measurement window is a crank-angle window. 
Method according to Claim 4 or 5, characterized 
in that the measurement window is a camshaft window. 
Device for recognizing the knocking of an internal-combustion 
engine, with a knock sensor (1) which is 

connected to an analog/digital converter (3), and with a 
position transmitter for setting a measurement window, in 

which the signals of the knock sensor are to be evaluated, 
characterized in that the output of the 

analog/digital converter is connected to one input of a 
signal processor (4), in that the signal of the position 

transmitter is connected to a further input of the signal 
processor (4), and the signal processor executes a highpass 

filtration of the knock signal during the measurement 
window and thereafter carries out a comparison of 

the high-pass-filtered signal with a first pressure 
threshold (P1), and counts the number of amplitudes of 

the high-frequency signal which exceed the first pressure 
threshold and compares this with a predetermined number, 

in that the signal processor subsequently integrates the 
high-pass-filtered signal and compares the integral with 

a second limit value (P2), and in that the signal 
processor recognizes knocking when the number of 

amplitudes of the high-frequency signal which exceed the 
first pressure threshold (P1) is higher than the predetermined 

number, and when the integrated signal exceeds 
the second limit value (P2). 
Device according to Claim 7, characterized in 
that the knock sensor (1) is a pressure transducer. 
Device according to Claim 7, characterized in 
that the position transmitter (7) is connected to the 

crankshaft. 
Device according to Claim 7 or 9, characterized 
in that the position transmitter (9) is connected to the 

camshaft.
