<ABSTRACT>
The elastically demultiplying dynamometer of the invention is divided into a frame bearer (1) and a load bearer (5) which are secured respectively to a frame (13) on the frame and to a load bridge (14) on the bridge side by means of screws (15) inserted through holes (2) in the frame bearer (1) and the load bearer (5). Both the frame bearer (1) and the load bearer (5) are secured to two short flexible rods (25) each with a vertical rod (6, 7); the two rods (6, 7) are in turn secured by two horizontal, superimposed, substantially parallel leaf springs (3, 4). From the rod (6) on the frame bearer side projects another leaf spring, referred to there as the measuring spring (10), substantially parallel and adjacent to the lower leaf spring (4) into the space between the rods (6, 7) and the leaf springs (3, 4); a similar measuring spring (11) projects from the rod (7) on the load bearer side substantially parallel and adjacent to the upper leaf spring (3) into the same space. A force sensor (12) is clamped between the two measuring springs (10, 11). The basic material for all the aforementioned components, except for the screws (15) and the force sensor (12), is a flat plate which is preferably divided and shaped into the components described and enumerated by wire erosion. It is thus possible to form the rod (6) and frame bearer (1) through a narrow slit (8) and the rod (6) and load bearer (5) through a similar narrow slit (9).

An elastically graduated force gauge on a framework (13) and a load bridge 
(14) with two flat springs (3, 4) and two measuring springs (10, 11), weaker 

in comparison with them and a force sensor (12) positioned between the 
measuring springs (10, 11), which force gauge is produced from one piece, 


with a frame carrier (1) fastened to the framework (13), a load carrier (5) 
fastened to the load bridge (14), a frame carrier side rod (6) running 

essentially parallel to the frame carrier (1), a load carrier side rod (7) running 
essentially parallel to the load carrier (5), which rods (6, 7) are essentially 

vertical, the two flat springs (3, 4) essentially horizontal and parallel to each 
other, and the two measuring springs (10, 11) essentially parallel to them 

and to each other and a force sensor (12) assembled between the measuring 
springs (10, 11), whereby 
one flat spring (3) runs above, the other flat spring (4) below, 
all these named parts of the force gauge (1, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 10, 11) with the 
exception of the force sensor (12) are produced from one piece by wire 

erosion, and this single piece is a flat plate, 
the separation of the frame carrier (1) and the frame carrier side rod (6) is 
produced by a narrow slit (8) essentially parallel to the named rod (6) and 

the separation of the load carrier and the load carrier side rod (7) is produced 
by a narrow slit (9) running essentially parallel to the last named rod, such 

that the connections both between the frame carrier (1) and the frame 
carrier side rod (6), and also that between the load carrier (5) and the load 

carrier side rod (7) each comprise two short flexure rods (25), whereby the 
upper flexure rod (25) essentially aligns with the upper flat spring (3) and 

the lower flexure rod (25) with the lower flat spring (4), 
the two flat springs (3, 4) each border the two rods (6, 7) above and below, 
the two flat springs (3, 4) extend horizontally from one rod (6) to the other 
rod (7). 
An elastically graduated force gauge according to Patent Claim 1, 
characterised in that 


the measuring spring (10) extending from the frame carrier side rod (6) is the 
lower and is thus adjacent to the lower flat spring (4), 
the measuring spring (11) extending from the load carrier side rod (7)is the 
upper and is thus adjacent to the upper flat spring (3), whereby the force 

sensor (12) assembled under pre-tension between the measuring springs 
(10, 11) is additionally loaded by pressure applied from above on the load 

carrier (5). 
An elastically graduated force gauge according to Patent Claim 1, 
characterised in that 


the measuring spring (11) extending from the frame carrier side rod (6) is the 
lower and is thus adjacent to the lower flat spring (3), 
the measuring spring (10) extending from the load carrier side rod (7) is the 
lower and is thus adjacent to the lower flat spring (4), whereby the force 

sensor (12) assembled under pre-tension between the measuring springs 
(10, 11) is partially released from loading by pressure applied from above on 

the load carrier (5). 
An elastically graduated force gauge according to Patent Claim 2 or 3, 
characterised in that 


the frame carrier (1) extends below the lower flat spring (4) past it, and the 
load carrier (5) 
the load carrier (5) has a continuation at its lower end, which is separated 
by a slot (18) from the frame carrier (1), 
the continuation of the load carrier (5) mentioned has a projection, which is 
surrounded by a continuation (21) of the frame carrier (1), which 

continuation (21) of the frame carrier (1) is separated from above only by a 
further slot (20) from the quoted projection of the continuation of the load 

carrier (5), whereby the maximum range of movement of the load carrier (5)  
 

related to the frame carrier (1) is defined by the sum of the widths of the 
two slots (18, 20).

characterised in that 


both the frame carrier (1) and also the load carrier (5) each have an 
essentially similarly formed continuation (26, 27), which continuations (26, 

27) are directed towards each other,

other continuation (27) by a cut out (23), which cut out (23) accepts the 

end of the other continuation (27) with vertical play such that between the 
cut out (23) and the end of the other continuation (27) a lower and an upper 

slot (18, 20) are present, whereby the maximum range of movement of the 
load carrier (5) in relation to the frame carrier (1) is defined by the sum of 

the widths of the two slots (18, 20).
