<ABSTRACT>
Telephone signals to be transmitted by SDH are transmitted in virtual containers (VC) 
in a number of fixed staff bytes which were hitherto unused. Two of these fixed bytes in 

each of these signal virtual containers are used to carry the timing information. This allows 
for up to a 16 bit code for the timing pointers to be provided, with timing resolution derived 

from the SDH line signal.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a method for the digital transmission of data of the kind in 
which data is transmitted by a system known as a synchronous digital hierarchy (SDH) in 
which bits of information are fed in a stream and are multiplexed with bits from other streams 
in a system known as tributaries which are combined or separated by a 
multiplexer/Demultiplexer (MUX). Such a system deals only with signals in digital form and 
enables an efficient and noise free transmission of data to take place. Signals transmitted 
under SDH are the subject of international standards and one particular standard is defined 
in CCITT recommendations G.707, G.708 and G.709. Unfortunately phase distortion can 
occur in transmission network corrupting its SDH and this is due to pointer justification. A solution to deal with this problem is set out in our co-pending British Patent 
Application No. 9111235.9. That patent application also describes a method of dealing with 
the problem in which a data stream at the node of a synchronous SDH transmission network 
has a specified line frequency and is composed of frames. Each frame is constructed as to 
contain a reference word and the node of the transmission network has a node frequency. In 
the improved method of that invention the method stores the incoming data stream in a buffer 
store at the node and uses a line reference of the incoming data stream to extract a data 
pointer from the data stream for each frame. This data pointer indicates the location of the 
reference word of that frame in the buffer store, furthermore the timing pointer is extracted  
 
from the incoming data stream utilising the line reference and a line clock, the frequency of 
which is a multiple of the line reference, the timing pointer so extracted is converted into a 
reference value by using the node reference and a node clock, the reference value is used to 
generate a node timing pointer, this node timing pointer is compared with a read address and 
data pointer and read-out from the buffer store is justified as a result of the comparison which 
takes place. The problem arising with the use of the invention described in our previous application 
is that the pointer information which was added, failed to pass through apparatus transmitting 
the frames. This obviously is a disadvantage and it is necessary for the pointer information 
to pass through without any corruption or distortion. It is an object of the present invention 
to provide an improved method and apparatus which enables the

<CLAIMS>
A method for the digital transmission data of the kind in which data is transmitted by 
a system known as a synchronous digital hierarchy (SDH) in which bits of information are 

fed in a stream an d are multiplexed with bits from other streams in a system known as 
tributaries which are combined or separated by a multiplexer/Demultiplexer (MUX), in which 

the signals to be transmitted are transmitted in virtual containers (VC) in a number of fixed 
stuff bytes which were hitherto unused. 
A method as claimed in Claim 1 in which two of the fixed stuff bytes in each of the 
signal virtual containers are used to carry the timing information. 
A method as claimed in Claim 2 in which a 16 bit code is provided as timing pointers. 
A method as claimed in any preceding claim in which the timing resolution of the 
transmitted information is derived from the SDH line signal. 
A method as claimed in Claim 4 in which the timing information is carried in the fixed 
stuff bytes in positions 2 and 3 of transmitted signal. 
A method as claimed in any one of Claims 2 to 5 in which at the receive side of the 
transmission the timing pointer value is extracted from the VC and connected to a reference 

value. 
A method as claimed in Claim 6 in which the conversion is affected by utilising the 
node reference of the SDH system and a node clock. 
A method as claimed in Claim 6 or Claim 7 in which the reference value generates 
 

a node timing pointer. 
A method for the digital transmissions of data using as SDH system substantially as 
hereinbefore described with reference to the accompanying drawings.
