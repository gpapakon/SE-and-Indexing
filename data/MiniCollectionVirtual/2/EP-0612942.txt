<ABSTRACT>
To improve and reduce the cost of producing a handle for sanitary valves which is provided with an inner part for coupling to a valve top part and with a metallic handle body which defines the shape of the handle, the proposal is that the inner part be designed as a supporting body on which, as a handle body, an essentially conically shaped metal sleeve is held at least at the ends, the open ends of the metal sleeve being closed by the supporting body.

Hood-shaped hand-grip, especially a twist grip, for 
sanitary fittings, which is provided with an inner part 

for coupling with the upper part of a valve and a metal 
hand-grip body which determines the shape of the hand-grip, 

the inner part being in the form of a carrier 
body (1), on which there is mounted as the hand-grip body 

a metal sleeve (2), the open end faces of the metal 
sleeve (2) being closed by the carrier body (1), 

characterised in that the metal sleeve (2) is essentially 
conical in shape, flanges (12, 13) are provided on the 

carrier body (1) at the two end face regions for securing 
the metal sleeve (2) axially at the end faces, whilst one 

or more grip recesses (21) is/are formed in the outer 
wall of the metal sleeve (2), which grip recesses effect 

non-rotatable coupling between the carrier body (1) and 
the metal sleeve (2) in the mounted position. 
Hand-grip according to claim 1, characterised in 
that the conically tapered region of the metal sleeve (2) 

faces the fitting, the end face of the metal sleeve (2) 
that faces the fitting snapping behind a radially 

projecting collar (11) of the carrier body (1) for 
securing in the mounted position. 
Hand-grip according to claim 1 or 2, characterised 
in that the metal sleeve (2) is supported in the wall 

region by longitudinal ribs (120, 121, 122) formed on 
the carrier body (1), parallel to the middle axis (10). 
Hand-grip according to any one of claims 1 to 3, 
characterised in that the metal sleeve (2) is made of  

 
brass tube having a wall thickness of approximately 

0.5 mm. 
Hand-grip according to any one of claims 1 to 4, 
characterised in that the carrier body (1) is 

manufactured from plastics using the injection-moulding 
method. 
Hand-grip according to any one of claims 1 to 5, 
characterised in that three symmetrically arranged grip 

recesses (21) are indented in the wall of the conical 
metal sleeve (2) in such a manner that the nearest side 

faces (210) of two adjacent grip recesses (21) are 
arranged approximately parallel with one another and 

each grip recess (21) is most deeply indented at the end 
face that has the large diameter, which indentation 

diminishes in size continuously in accordance with the 
tapering of the metal sleeve (2) so that the end face of 

the metal sleeve (2) that has the small diameter is 
circular in cross-section. 
Hand-grip according to claim 6, characterised in that 
at least three longitudinal ribs (120, 121) formed 

parallel with one another are provided on the carrier 
body (1), two longitudinal ribs (120) being formed on one 

half of the carrier body (1) and the third longitudinal 
rib (121) being formed on the other half in such a manner 

that, when the metal sleeve (2) is in the mounted 
position, one grip recess (21) is received non-rotatably 

between the two longitudinal ribs (120) and the 
longitudinal ribs (120, 121) rest supportingly against 

the conical wall surface of the metal sleeve (2). 
Hand-grip according to claim 7, characterised in that 
two further longitudinal ribs (122) for supporting the 

metal sleeve (2), which longitudinal ribs are  
 

perpendicular to the longitudinal ribs (120, 121), are 
formed on the diameter of the carrier body (1) in such a 

manner that the parting plane of the mould for 
manufacturing the carrier body (1) extends through those 

longitudinal ribs (122). 
Hand-grip according to any one of claims 5 to 8, 
characterised in that the large flange (13) on the 

carrier body (1) is formed with two parallel radial 
webs (15) so that it is possible to produce the undercut 

using radially retractable mould parts.
