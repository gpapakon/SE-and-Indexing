<ABSTRACT>
A porous ceramic mainly comprising silicon carbide or nitride, having strength, heat resistance and thermal 
shock resistance superior to the conventional products, containing many micropores wherein the pore diameter is 1 

µm or less and the porosity is 35% or above, and having a flexural strength of 100 MPa or above. The production 
process comprises mixing a silicon oligomer capable of yielding silicon carbide or nitride by firing with powdery 

silicon carbide, silicon nitride or other ceramic each having an average particle diameter of 1.0 µm or less, forming 
the resultant mixture, and sintering the formed mixture in a suitable atmosphere at 1,200 °C or a
bove.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a ceramic porous
body having a large number of fine pores and high
strength, and a method of producing the same.Ceramic porous bodies are used in a wide range of
applications, such as catalyst carriers, filters, and
sensors, as well as in building materials, such as heat
insulation material. Various materials for ceramic porous
bodies are known including alumina, silicon carbide,
aluminum silicate, silica, and cordierite, which are
suitably selected for use according to the intended end
use.Recently, however, in applications such as filters
and catalyst carriers, conventional ceramic porous bodies
are experiencing difficulty in meeting the requirements
for strength and heat resistance because the environments
in which they are used are tending to become increasingly
harsh due to factors such as increased stress applied and
higher working temperatures.For example, as an automotive exhaust gas cleaning
catalyst carrier there has been put in practical use a
honeycomb filter of cordierite which is produced by 
sintering a cordierite molding made by extrusion to a
honeycomb configuration; but with such a catalyst carrier,
further improvement is desired in its characteristics,
such as strength, heat resistance and thermal shock
resistance.Silicon carbide and silicon nitride are known as
examples of ceramics having high strength and high heat
resistance, but at present there are only available for
limited use porous bodies of such ceramics which have
relatively large pores or have lower strength. For
example, according to what is stated in "Powder and Powder
Metallurgy", Vol. 38, No. 3, pp. 62 - 63, porous bodies of
high strength have been produced by sintering a composite
of SiC powder and polysilastyrene, but they are of about 1
µm in pore diameter, with a porosity of the order of 34%.Ceramic Engineering and Science Proceedings, Volume 10, parts 7-8, 1989, pp. 833-836 disclose porous silicon carbide or silicon nitride bodies produced by a pyrolysis process at temperatures lower than 1400°C.The present invention consists in a ceramic porous body
comprising silicon carbide or silicon nitride as a principal
component, said ceramic porous body having a mean pore
diameter of not more than 1 µm and a porosity of not less than
35%, and having a flexural strength of not less than 100 MPa.There can thus be provided a ceramic porous body which
has a high strength, high heat resistance and high thermal
shock resistance and, in addition, contains a large number of
fine pores. Such a
