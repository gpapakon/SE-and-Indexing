<ABSTRACT>
The present invention relates to a filling burst structure used in a digital cellular radio communications system operating according to the principle of Time Division Multiple Access (TTMA), each cell of the system being associated with a beacon frequency subdivided into frames (T') which are repeated periodically and each comprising at least one signalling channel or beacon channel (ITO) for transmitting signalling messages (Bs) intended for mobile stations, the other channels (IT1, ..., IT7) being intended particularly for transmitting useful data (BT), the burst being sent on the channels of the beacon frequency which are not allocated to transmission of useful data or on certain time intervals of the signalling channel when there is no signalling data to be transmitted over these time intervals, characterised in that the filling burst (BRS) contains a signalling message.

Filler burst structure used in a digital
radiocommunications cellular system operating along the

principle of Time Division Multiple Access (TDMA), each cell
in this system being associated with a beacon frequency

subdivided into frames (T') repeated periodically, and each
comprising at least one signalling channel or beacon path

(ITO) for the transmission of signalling messages (B
S
)
containing a synchronization burst intended for mobile

stations, the other channels (IT1, ...IT7) being intended for
the transmission of user data (B
T
) said filler burst being
transmitted on the channels of said beacon frequency which are

not allocated to the transmission of user data, 
characterized
in that
 said filler burst (B
RS
) contains said synchronisation
burst which is repeated in at least one of said other channels

(IT2, IT3, IT6, IT7) which is not allocated to the
transmission of user data.
Filler burst structure as in claim 1, 
characterized
in that
 each filler burst (B
RS
) contains a synchronisation
burst which is repeated in each of said other channels (IT2,

IT3, IT6, IT7) which is not allocated to the transmission of
user data.
Filler burst structure as in claim 1 or 2,

characterized in that
 said synchronization burst contains
synchronization data intended for mobile stations located in

or in the vicinity of a cell with which the beacon frequency,
on which it is transmitted, is associated.
Filler burst structure as in any of claims 1 to 3,

characterized in that
 said filler burst contains both said 
synchronization burst intended for mobile stations located in

or in the vicinity of a cell with which the beacon frequency
on which it is transmitted is associated, and other signalling

information.
Filler burst structure as in either of claims 3 or
4, 
characterized in that
 said synchronization burst comprises
a so-called training sequence recognizable by the mobile

station or stations for which it is intended.
Filler burst structure as in any of claims 1 to 5,

characterized in that
 when said system for the transmission of
said signalling messages, in addition to said beacon frequency

called main beacon frequency, uses an auxiliary beacon
frequency, the filler bursts on said auxiliary beacon

frequency have the same structure as the filler bursts used on
said main beacon frequency.
Method for transmitting signalling messages to one
or more mobile stations operating under the cover of cells in

a digital radiocommunications cellular system operating along
the principle of Time Division Multiple Access, each cell of

this system being associated with a beacon frequency
subdivided into periodically repeated frames and each

comprising at least one signalling channel or beacon path for
the transmission of signalling messages to mobile stations,

the other channels being intended for the transmission of user
data, 
characterized in that
 the signalling messages
transmitted on the beacon path comprise an information

intended for mobile station or stations that are already
synchronized indicating to the latter that the filler bursts

transmitted on the channels of said beacon frequency which are
not allocated to the transmission of user data contain 

signalling data to be acquired and have a structure as in any
of claims 1 to 6.
Method for allocating a traffic channel in a digital
radiocommunications cellular system operating along the

principle of Time Division Multiple Access (TDMA), each cell
in this system being associated with a beacon frequency

subdivided into periodically repeated frames and each
comprising at least one signalling channel or beacon path for

the transmission of signalling messages to mobile stations,
the other so-called traffic channels being intended for the

transmission of user data, a filler burst being transmitted on
the channels of the beacon frequency which are not allocated

to the transmission of user data,
characterized in that
, when frequencies other than the beacon
frequency are available for traffic, it consists of firstly

assigning traffic channels to these frequencies so as to leave
free the traffic channels of the beacon frequency for the

transmission of filler bursts as in any of claims 1 to 6.
Base station (BTS1) of a digital radiocommunications
cellular system operating along the principle of Time Division

Multiple Access, comprising in particular transmitting and
receiving means (E/R) and piloting means (L) 
characterized in
that
, in response to an order received from radio resource
management means (GRR) of said system indicating which traffic

channels of said beacon frequency are unused for transmitting
user data and which time intervals of said signalling channel

are unused for transmitting signalling messages, said piloting
means (L) commands means to produce bursts (E) having a

structure as in any of claims 1 to 5, these filler bursts
being transmitted by said transmitting/receiving means (E/R)

during time intervals corresponding to the channels of said 
beacon frequency which are not allocated to the transmission

of user data.
Base station as in claim 9, 
characterized in that

said piloting means is designed to control the transmission of
filler bursts whose content depends on unused traffic channels

for the transmission of user data.
Base station as in either of claims 9 or 10,

characterized in that
 said piloting means is designed to
control the transmission by said transmitting/receiving means,

on said beacon path, of signalling messages comprising data
indicating to mobile stations that are already synchronized

which traffic channels are used to transmit said filler bursts
which may also contain signalling messages.
Radio resource management member for a digital

principle of Time Division Multiple Access, a system in which
each cell is associated with a beacon frequency subdivided

signalling messages to mobile stations, the other so-called

data, a filler burst being transmitted on the channels of the
beacon frequency which are not allocated to the transmission

of user data,
characterized in that
 said radio resource management member
comprises means for determining whether frequencies 
other than
the beacon frequency are available for traffic, and for

allocating traffic channels firstly to these frequencies so as
to leave free the traffic channels of the beacon frequency for

the transmission of filler bursts as in any of claims 1 to 6.
