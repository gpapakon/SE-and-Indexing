<ABSTRACT>
A charging device for use in an image forming 
apparatus is disclosed which charges an object to be 

charged by contacting a conductive charging member with 
the surface of the object and then applying a voltage 

across the charging member and the object,
 

   wherein at least a contact portion of the 
charging member comprises a conductive material having a 

hygroscopic degree of 0.2 % or less.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a charging
device for use in a copier, a printer or like image
forming apparatus that utilizes electrophotographic
technologies.In conventional image forming apparatus
employing the electrophotographic technology (Carlson
Process), a corona charging device utilizing corona
discharges has been used to charge a photosensitive body
to a certain potential. However, this type of a charging
device often generates electrical noises in peripheral
devices due to a high voltage required for corona
discharge, or discomforts persons around the apparatus
because of much ozone generated from the device. In view
of those disadvantages, another charging device has been
proposed to replace the corona charging device, in which
a roller or strip-shaped charging member provided with
conductive yarns or conductive resin over its surface
contacts with a photosensitive body to be charged, and a
voltage is applied across the charging member and the
photosensitive body. This charging device has enabled 
charging without using a high voltage. It electrically
feeds the photosensitive body via a contact portion
therebetween and utilizes discharge generated across a
small gap adjacent the contact portion.The charging principle for this charging device
will be described with reference to Figs. 1 and 2. In
the charging device, a conductive brush roller 5 provided
with conductive yarns 5a on its surface is used as a
charging member. The charging brush roller 5 and a
photosensitive body 1 contact with each other at a
contact point B and rotate in opposite directions with
each other. As described below, across the conductive
brush roller 5 and the photosensitive body are applied
d.c. voltages only. Let an arbitrary point A on the
photosensitive body 1 on the verge of rotating be within
a certain distance from a conductive yarn 5a as shown in
Fig. 2. If an applied voltage Vap is greater than a
discharge starting voltage Vth determined by the above-mentioned
distance, discharge from the conductive yarn 5a
occur, whereby the charging of the photosensitive body 1
is initiated. Then, the charged voltage denoted as Vsp
on the photosensitive body 1 rises with the discharge
from the conductive yarn 5a until the difference between
the applied voltage and the supplied charge on the
photosensitive body 1 becomes equal to the discharge 
starting voltage, and then the discharge stops. Further,
the d.c current flowing through the conductive yarn 5a
produces a voltage drop denoted as Vdown on the
conductive yarn 5a.
