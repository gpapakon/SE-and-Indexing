<ABSTRACT>
A closure device for use with a container (11) having an open neck finish, including an inner cap (21) having a skirt (27) terminating in an open end which engages the outside diameter (D1) of the finish. The inner cap (21) is sized to initially engage the finish. The skirt (27) has circumferentially spaced slits (33) extending, which may function as lyophilization ports, which permit the inner cap (21) to expand upon an axial closing force and engage the bottom of the finish. A liner (19) is positioned in the inner cap (21) proximate the closed end and is compressed against the finish when the cap is moved to alignment with the bottom of the finish. An outer cap (17) is locked on to the inner cap (21) in pre-assembly which then encloses the inner cap (21) after complete assembly to seal and compress the liner (19) between the finish (43) and the inside face of the inner cap (21). In a preferred embodiment, an inwardly facing ridge (35) is located on the inside of the inner cap (21) to engage the liner (19) by a distance sufficient to permit the liner (19) to seal to the finish (43) over the maximum variation of dimensions for the liner (19) and for the crown on the finish (43).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a two piece all 
plastic seal, and more particularly to a seal device which 
is useful with a lyophilization container and which 
effectively seals the vial without the use of a metal cap 
seal.  
 Medicaments have been packaged in containers such as 
glass vials with rubber stoppers for many years. As concern 
for package integrity and other packaging consideration have 
increased, various improvements have been adopted to provide 
more satisfactory container assemblies. One such 
development was the use of aluminum and other metal or metal 
alloys as a cap seal, where the aluminum seal is crimped or 
curved around the finish of the vial to hold the rubber 
stopper firmly in place. While this has been found to be 
ideal in some circumstances, aluminum seals are not the 
universal answer to all medical packaging concerns. One particular packaging endeavor in the medical 
industry where aluminum seals have provided disadvantages as 
well as advantages is in lyophilization procedures where the 
stopper is partially inserted into the vial before a 
lyophilization procedure, followed by a complete insertion 
of the stopper into the vial. Aluminum seals have prevented 
efficient lyophilization because it is difficult to apply a 
suitable crimp to the seal after the lyophilization step. 
In addition, silicone or some other lubricant is needed to 
insure adequate sealing. Finally, aluminum and other metals 
produce small particles when handled which are difficult to 
keep out of vials being filled, requiring inspection or 
other expensive product control steps. It would be of great 
advantage in the medical product packaging industry if an 
effective seal could be provided which does not employ 
aluminum or other metals as sealing elements. The lyophilization process itself is one which requires 
a great deal of precise control if efficiencies and 
economies are to be achieved. particularly important is the 
rate of lyophilization, which must be controlled at a rate 
which does not damage or otherwise affect the drugs or other 
contents and yet which is as rapid as possible for economic 
reasons. It is always desirable to balance efficiency with  
 
effectiveness, so that the best possible product for the 
best possible price is produced. An improved design will be 
of great advantage in the packaging of medicament. One of the difficulties incurred in packaging 
medicaments generally and in lyophilization processes in 
particular is the use of excess force to insert the stopper

<CLAIMS>
A closure for use with a container (11) having a discharge 
opening, comprising: 


an inner cap (21) having a top (23) and a skirt (27) 
depending axially therefrom, said skirt (27) terminating in first engagement means (29) for 

engaging said container (11) adjacent said discharge opening to provide a first assembly position 
with said top (23) spaced from said container (11) by a first distance, said skirt (27) including 

a plurality of circumferentially spaced slits (33); 
a liner (19) held by said skirt (27) in a position proximate 
to said top (23) and having a thickness less than said first distance to cooperate with said slits 

(33) to define an air path for access to said discharge opening in said first assembly position; 
an outer cap (17) having a top (16) and a dependent skirt 
including second engagement means on its terminal end for engaging the outside of said inner 

cap (21) proximate its top (23) in said first assembly position; 
said first engagement means (29) disengages upon 
application of a first axial force to move said inner cap (21) and said liner (19) to sealing 

engagement with said discharge opening; and  
 
said second engagement means disengages upon application of a second 
greater force to thereby position said outer cap (17) in surrounding relationship over said inner 

cap (21). 
The device of claim 1, wherein said second engagement means comprises 
an outwardly facing groove (45) on said outside of said inner cap (21) and an inwardly facing 

ring (47) on said inner diameter of said outer cap (17). 
The device of claim 1, wherein said liner (19) is an disc having a diameter 
greater than the inside diameter of said inner cap (21) by an amount sufficient to supporting said 

liner (19) in said upper position by friction between said skirt (27) and said liner (19). 
The device of claim 1, wherein said liner (19) is compressed against said 
container (11) by the inside face of said top (23) of said inner cap (21). 
The device of claim 4, which further includes at least one inwardly facing 
annular ridge (35) mounted on the inside face of said top (23) of said inner cap (21) and having 

a liner engaging edge spacing said liner (19) from said inside face by a distance sufficient to 
permit said liner (19) to seal to said container (11) over the maximum variation of dimensions 

for said liner (19) and for the crown on said container (11) when said liner (19) is compressed. 
The device of claim 1, wherein said liner (19) is a flat elastomeric disc. 
The device of claim 1, wherein said liner (19) is a stopper having a 
dependant plug portion.  

 
The device of claim 1, wherein said liner (19) is molded into the inner cap 
(21) using a two step injection molding step to become an integral part of said inner cap (21). 
The device of claim 1, wherein said inner cap (21) includes a terminal end 

having an inwardly facing surface for contacting said container (11), said surface being skewed 
inwardly to force said surface outward to grip said container (11) as it is forced into parallel 

contact with said container (11).
