<ABSTRACT>
The invention pertains to the pharmacotechnical field. More precisely, it discloses a method for preparing pharmaceutical compositions for the absorption of active ingredients with low resorption properties or capable of being hydrolysed, wherein multilamellar liposomes are first formed by dissolving a phospholipid and cholesterol mixture in a chlorinated solvent and then evaporating the solvent, the dry residue is dispersed in an aqueous disperson of the active ingredient to be incorporated, the vesicles thus obtained are filtered on polyacrylamide gel, and said vesicles are eluted by means of a buffer solution. These active ingredients are therapeutically useful.
