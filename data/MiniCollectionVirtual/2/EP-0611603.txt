<ABSTRACT>
An electrostatic powder spray gun (10) includes a hose 
purge adapter (76) connected in the hose line (21,72) that supplies 

powder to the gun (10). The hose purge adapter (76) is connected to 
a supply of purge gas and allows the powder flow path in 

the hose line (21,72) and the powder flow path in the gun (10) to be 
quickly and conveniently purged of accumulations of powder. 

By facilitating purging of the powder flow path, the purge 
adapter (76) prevents accumulations of powder that may tend to 

come loose as a soft lump of powder, usually different in 
colour, and cause an imperfection on the surface of the 

object being coated. The purge adapter (76) also reduces the 
collections of powder in the flow path in the hose line 

which facilitate a grounding path by the powder, resulting 
in possible shocks to the operator and in a high current 

draw into the gun (10) from which poor transfer efficiency can 
result.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to electrostatic powder spraying,
and more particularly to spraying dry blended powders, such
as those containing mica or metallic particles, or
other powders containing electrically conductive material.Various electrostatic spray coating processes and guns
used for charging particles of a coating material emitted from
the gun are well known. In a typical electrostatic powder
spraying process, powder is conveyed in an air stream to a
spray gun. The powder is electrically charged to some high
voltage potential. The charging system generally operates at
a potential of at least 60 kilovolts (KV). In the usual
situation, electrostatic powder spray systems are used to coat
electrically conductive or at least partially conductive
objects. To attract the coating material to the object to be
coated, the coating particles are charged to a different
polarity than the object to be coated. The objects to be
coated are usually held at ground voltage potential by some
appropriate means. Electrostatic forces between the charged
powder and the grounded conductive object cause the powder to
be drawn to the object to be coated.In order to charge the powder in an electrostatic spray
coating system, it is necessary to have some means of applying
the charge to the powder. Charging is usually accomplished
in the spray gun by an electrode connected to a high voltage
power supply. The electrode is placed in close proximity to
or even in contact with the stream of powder. Early forms of electrostatic spray guns were powered from
remote high-voltage d.c. supplies that provided output
voltages of 60 KV or higher. The output voltage of such power
supplies was conducted via high voltage cables to particle-charging
electrodes mounted near the nozzles of the guns. To
provide a safe and more maneuverable gun, miniaturized voltage
multiplier circuits operating at high frequency were developed
that could fit within the electrostatic spray gun to produce
the requisite high d.c. charging voltage from a lower input
voltage. Such guns with internal high voltage multiplication
capabilities are generally powered from an external low
voltage power supply via a low voltage cable to the gun which
is more flexible than high voltage cables. The integral high
voltage circuit steps up the low input voltage by means of a
transformer, rectifies and multiplies the step-up voltage in
a diode/capacitor multiplier cascade, and outputs a high d.c.
voltage to the particle-charging electrode of the gun.U.S. Patent No. 5026720 discloses
