<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a system for downloading program data on a site or reception device comprising a process controller for this device based on a server station. The system comprises a reception circuit (1) for an external analog signal, sca, for controlling the triggering of the downloading process and a circuit (2) for enabling the downloading process on receiving the aforesaid signal sca. A program data storage circuit (3) is provided, storage intervening following the enabling of the downloading process. Application to the construction of devices such as vehicles of any type, especially automobiles.

<CLAIMS>
A system for downloading program data, from a central
server, onto a reception site or device for these

data, comprising a process controller (12), the system
being made up from a micro - controller comprising

input ports (120,122) and output ports (121) for
analogue signals and at least one serial transmission

- reception port (123,124), characterised in that the
system comprises means (1) for the reception of an

external analogue command signal (sca) for the start
of the downloading process, means (2) for enabling the

downloading process, on the reception of the said
external analogue signal (sca), created by the said

process controller (12) controlled by a guiding
program of a downloading protocol and a module (3) for

putting to memory the program data, following the
enabling of the downloading process, and in that the

said enabling means (2) of the downloading program
comprise:


means (20) for the conditional emission of an
enabling message (m-va) for the downloading process,

and
means (21) for the reception and recognition of the
enabling message (
m-va) for the downloading process,
the said emitting means (20) and receiving means

(21) for the said enabling message (m-va) being
inter connected through a connector device linked to

the central server, this allowing for the
verification that the micro - controller is properly

connected to the central server.
A system according to Claim 1, such that the said
means (1) for the reception of the said external 

analogue signal (sca) comprises threshold comparator
means, linked to one of the said input ports for the

analogue signal of the said micro - controller (12),
the said threshold comparator means allowing through a

comparison of the amplitude of the said external
signal (sca) to the said threshold value, to

distinguish the logic value of the said external
signal (sca), which allows the start of the down

loading process to be controlled, as a function of the
logic value of the said external analogue signal

(sca), the loading of the program data being carried
out though the said serial port (123,124).
A system according to Claim 1, such that the said
enabling message (m-va) of the downloading process is

formed by a succession of binary values constituting
an enabling code.
A system according to one of the Claims 1 to 3, such
that the said emitting means (20) is made up by a

program for emitting an enabling message (m-va), the
said enabling message (m-va) being emitted at an

analogue output port (121) of the said micro -
controller (12), and in that the said reception and

recognition means (21) is made up of a comparison
program of the said enabling message (m-va) received

at an analogue input port (122) of the said micro -
controller (12) with a predetermined reference

message, the said analogue input port (122) and the
said analogue output port (121) of the said micro -

controller being electrically linked.
A system according to one of the preceding Claims 1 to
4, such that the said downloading protocol comprises

at least successively following the step of receiving 
the external analogue command signal (sca) for the

start of the said downloading process,

a step of emitting, from the central server site to
a reception site, a command message for the start up

of the downloading (m-start),
a step of emitting, from the reception site of the
program data to the said central server site, a

synchronisation message for the transmission of the
program data (m-sync),
a step of transmitting the said program data from
the central server site to the said reception site

of the program data, and
a response step by emitting a transmission receipt
message (ACK) emitted from the program data

reception site to the said central server cite.
A system according to one of the preceding claims,
such that the said means (3) for putting to memory the

said program data comprise at least one electronically
programmable read only memory (31), which allows, for

a given material configuration of the said downloading
system, to put to memory program data relating to

automobile vehicles with difference characteristics.
