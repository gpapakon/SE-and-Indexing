<ABSTRACT>
A process is disclosed for processing analogical and binary measurement values detected by sensors in a water or caloric power plant. The analogical and binary measurement values detected in steady and unsteady operational states, such as run-ups, run-outs, load sheddings and emergency conditions, are supplied to a relational real time data bank (12) after having been converted into corresponding digital signals and correspondingly prepared and pre-processed (22, 23). The real time data bank (12) is distributed in a digital computer system which consists of at least two digital computers mutually linked by a ring and having a central unit, a storage unit and a display device. The digital computer system is further provided with an expert system (13, 14) and with calculation modules (15, 16, 17, 18) which determine the instantaneous machine data from the measurement values. These are compared by the expert system (13, 14) with the calculated machine data or with the machine data measured in the original state and stored in the real time data bank (12), then evaluated. In addition, the expert system (13, 14) carries out a trend analysis (25) and an on-line diagnosis of the state of the power plant. Since with this process the instantaneous state of the generator and of the turbines is always known, maintenance operations according to fixed schedules are no longer required and a state-dependent maintenance can be adopted.

Method of processing analog and binary measured
variables acquired by means of active and passive

sensors in a plant generating primarily electrical
energy, preferably a hydro-electric power station or

thermal power station, characterized in that the
analog and binary measured values acquired both in the

case of steady-state and transient operating states of
the plant, in particular for starting, running down,

load shedding and malfunctions, are supplied following
conversion into corresponding digital signals and

after suitable conditioning and preprocessing (22, 23)
to a relational real-time database (12), which is

distributed to a digital computer system (1, 2, 3, 4,
5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11) consisting of at least two and

preferably three digital computers (1, 2, 3) linked
via a ring (4) with a central unit, storage unit (5)

and visualization device (6, 10), and that provided in
the digital computer system (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8,

9, 10, 11) are an expert system (13, 14) and
calculation modules (15, 16, 17, 18), which ascertain

the momentary machine data from the measured
variables, and these are compared by the expert system

(13, 14) with machine data calculated or measured in
the original state and filed in the real-time database

(12), and are subjected to evaluation, and furthermore
a trend analysis (25) and on-line diagnosis of the

plant state is performed by the expert system (13,
14).

fault analysis packets are provided in the digital

computer system (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11)

units such as the generator cooling circuit, bearings
and bearing cooling circuit, for example. 
Method according to claim 1 or 2, characterized in
that the main program of the expert system (13, 14)

contains parameterization files and control functions,
control functions being input entries of variable time

cycles, variable storage cycles, control criteria from
expert program sections, control criteria of the

visualization device (6, 10) or control criteria from
measured variable acquisition (20, 21) and measured

variable preprocessing (22, 23).
Method according to any one of claims 1 to 3,

characterized in that the state of machine components
such as turbine bearings, generator bearings, stator

winding etc. is ascertained on the basis of measured

characterized in that the generator and turbine
performance characteristics are calculated on the

basis of actual boundary conditions, in particular
measured variables.
