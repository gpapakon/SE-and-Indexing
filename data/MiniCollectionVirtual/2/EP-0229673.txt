<ABSTRACT>
This application discloses a thermal ink 
jet printhead and related integrated pulse driver 

circuit useful in thermal ink jet printers. This 
combined printhead and pulse drive integrated circuit 

includes a first level (5,6) of metallization compriÂ­
sing a refractory metal which is patterned to define 

the lateral dimension of the printhead resistor 
(4). A passivation layer or layers (7,8,9) are 

deposited atop this first level (5,6) of metalization 
and patterned to have an opening or openings therein 

for receiving a second level (10,11) of metalization. 
This second level (10,11) of metallization such 

as aluminium may then be used for electrically 
interconnecting the printhead resistors (4) to MOSFET 

drivers and the like which have been fabricated 
in the same silicon substrate (1) which provides 

suport for the printhead resistors (4). Thus, this 
"on-chip" driver construction enables these pulse 

driver transistor to be moved from external electronic 
circuitry to the printhead substrate.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a process for fabricating a printhead 
structure for a thermal ink jet printhead which includes providing 
a substrate support member, and then depositing in succession a 
resistive heater layer material and a conductive trace pattern to 
define the lateral extent of a plurality of heater resistors, 
whereby atop the substrate support member there is deposited a 
layer of resistive material consisting of polycrystalline silicon 
and on the surface of this layer there is formed a conductive 
pattern of a refractory metal for providing a path for drive 
current to predefined areas in said resisitive material. Such a process has been described inter alia in US-A 4,513,298 
and in Hewlett Packard Journal, Vol, 36, Number 5, May 1985. In the manufacture of thermal ink jet printheads, it is known to 
provide conductive traces of aluminum over a  
 
chosen resistive material, such as tantalum-aluminum, to 
provide electrical lead-in conductors for conducting current 
pulses to the lithographically defined heater resistors in 
the resistive material. These conductive traces are formed 
by first sputtering aluminum on the surface of a layer of 
resistive material and thereafter defining conductive trace 
patterns in the aluminum using conventional photolithographic 
masking and etching processes. It is also known in this art to deposit an inert 
refractory material such as silicon carbide or silicon 
nitride over the aluminum trace material and the exposed 
resistive material in order to provide a barrier layer 
between the resistive and conductive material and the ink. 
This ink is stored in individual reservoirs and heated by 
thermal energy passing from the individually defined resistors 
and through the barrier layer to the ink reservoirs 
atop the barrier layer. The ink is highly corrosive, so it 
is important that the barrier layer be chemically inert and 
highly impervious to the ink. In the deposition process used to form the barrier 
layer for the above printhead structure, rather sharply 
rounded contours are produced in the barrier layer material 
at the edges of the conductive aluminum traces. These 
contours take the form of rounded edges in the silicon 
carbide layer which first extend laterally outward over the  
 
edges of the aluminum traces and then turn back in and down 
in the direction of the edge of the aluminum trace at the 
active resistor area. Here the silicon carbide barrier 
material forms an intersection with another, generally flat 
section of silicon
