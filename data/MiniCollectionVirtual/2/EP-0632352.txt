<ABSTRACT>
The system comprises: a master unit (A) which is 
interfaced on one side with the controller (C) of the loom 

over dedicated wires and/or a serial line, and on the other 
side with the peripheral unit or units (P₁, P₂, P
n
) over a 
synchronous serial line; a set of slave units (B₁, B₂, B
n
), 
each of which is an integral part of a respective 

peripheral unit (P₁-P
n
) capable of sending data over the 
synchronous serial line and of receiving data from the 

master unit (A) over the same interface line; a serial line 
bus (BU) that includes: dedicated unidirectional signals 

(PCS) that connect the master unit (A) to each slave unit 
for selection; a first common signal (MOSI) that 

constitutes a unidirectional data line for transmission 
from the master unit (A) to the selected slave unit (B); a 

second common signal (MISO) that forms a second 
unidirectional data line for transmission from the selected 

individual slave unit (B) to the master unit (A); and a 
third common signal (SCK) that forms a unidirectional line 

for transferring to the slave units the synchronization 
clock pulses emitted by the master unit.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a system for
interfacing one or more intelligent peripheral units with a
weaving loom or other textile machine.Conventional weaving looms, and other similar textile
machines, use peripheral units such as, typically, weft
feeders for gripper looms, weft pre-measurers for jet
looms, brakes for automatic weft tension control and the
like, all of which are controlled electronically, and
therefore briefly termed "intelligent", and are interfaced
with sensors and/or actuators which reside on the loom.In known electronic applications, for weaving looms or
other textile machines, interfacing between the above
intelligent peripheral units and the loom is provided by
means of digital signals or in any case signals of the "on-off"
(yes-no) type with dedicated wires whose number is
equal to the number of signals to be transmitted to and
from each peripheral unit.It is evident that this known interfacing system has
obvious drawbacks due to the multiplication of the
dedicated wires in proportion to the increase in the number
of peripheral units associated with the loom and of
functions performed by each unit and controlled by the
sensors and/or actuators of said loom.In order to obviate these drawbacks it has already
been proposed to use a serial asynchronous connection
between the loom and the peripheral units, but so far the
applications that have been produced have failed to yield
satisfactory results not because of the complexity of the 
circuits residing on the loom and on the peripheral units,
but essentially because of the slowness of their
transmission, the baud rate of which is generally lower
than, or equal to, 38,400 baud. Accordingly, the serial
interfaces produced so far are suitable only for
transmitting signals related to the medium- and long-term
operation of the loom, such as the setup and configuration
signals and the like, but are fully inadequate for real-time
data transmission, which however is indispensable to
perform the instantaneous control of many functions both of
the peripheral units and of the loom, such as for example
control of the modulated-action electronic weft brakes in
feeders for gripper looms, release of the electromagnetic
retention of the weft in feeders for jet looms, and real-time
control of the drivers of feeder motors and the like.In order to provide real-time data transmission
between the loom controller and peripheral units such as
pre-feeders, electronic brakes, motor drivers and the like,
the current trend is to provide a two-way
