<ABSTRACT>
A child safety seat for use in a vehicle comprises 
a seat body (10) having a seat portion (12) and a backrest 

portion (14). In order to connect the seat body (10) to a 
motor vehicle, a pair of attachment buckles (36) are 

mounted by means of rigid links (30, 32) on opposite sides 
of the seat body (10) for movement between first and second 

positions. In the first position, the buckles (36) project 
rearwardly so as to be engageable with two anchorage units 

(40) which are rigidly fixed to the vehicle body so as to 
be accessible between the seat portion (16) and the 

backrest portion (18) of the vehicle seat. In the second 
position, the buckles (36) provide support for guide means 

for an adult seat belt (104).

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a child safety seat for 
use in a vehicle of the type comprising a seat body having 
a seat portion and a backrest portion, and releasable 
coupling means for connecting the seat body to a motor 
vehicle (see for example WO-A-8 901 422). It is well known for the coupling means of a seat 
of this type to comprise an adult seat belt, the child seat 
resting on the corresponding vehicle seat The 
disadvantage of this arrangement is that, even if the adult 
belt is pulled very tight during installation, the 
resilience of both the vehicle seat and the belt will 
permit undesirable movement of the child seat relative to 
the vehicle in the event of sudden deceleration, for 
example during an accident. In order to overcome this 
disadvantage, it has been proposed to provide motor cars 
with anchorage units which are rigidly secured to the 
vehicle body at agreed locations for engagement by 
releasable connectors which are rigidly coupled to a 
child's seat. Such anchorage units will be referred to 
hereinafter as "standard anchorage units". The present 
invention is concerned with the provision of a child's seat 
which can be used with both of the foregoing mounting 
arrangements. According to the invention, the releasable 
coupling means comprises a pair of attachment buckles 
mounted by means of rigid links on opposite sides of the 
seat body for movement between a first position in which 
they project rearwardly so as to be engageable with two 
standard anchorage units which are accessible between the 
seat portion and the backrest portion of the vehicle seat 
and a second position in which they provide support for 
guide means for an adult seat belt. This arrangement has the advantage that the same 
load-bearing attachments to the seat body are used both 
when the seat is attached to standard anchorage units in a 
vehicle and when it is secured to the vehicle using an 
adult seat belt.  
 Preferably, releasable means are provided for 
securing each of the attachment buckles either in its first 
position or in its second position. The guide means for adult seat belt may be 
integral with the attachment buckles. Alternatively the 
guide means may comprise a respective detachable guide unit 
for each attachment buckle adapted to be engaged by the 
latching mechanism thereof. In one form of the invention, the final stage of 
the movement of the attachment buckles into their second 
position is arranged to apply additional tension to the 
adult seat belt if it is fastened before such

<CLAIMS>
A child safety seat for use in a vehicle 
comprising a seat bo
dy (10, 120, 130) having a seat portion 
(12) and a backrest portion (14), and releasable coupling 

means for connecting the seat body (10, 120, 130) to a 
motor vehicle, characterised in that the releasable 

coupling means comprises a pair of attachment buckles (36, 
136) mounted by means of rigid links (30, 32, 132) on 

opposite sides of the seat body (10, 120, 130) for movement 
between a first position in which they project rearwardly 

so as to be engageable with two standard anchorage units 
(40) which are accessible between the seat portion (16) and 

the backrest portion (18) of the vehicle seat and a second 
position in which they provide support for guide means (92, 

134) for an adult seat belt (104). 
A child safety seat according to claim 1, wherein 
each rigid link (30, 32, 132) is pivotally mounted on the 

seat body (10, 120, 130). 
A child safety seat according to claim 1 or 2, 
wherein each attachment buckle (136) has integral guide 

means (134) for the adult seat belt (10, 104). 
A child safety seat according to claim 1 or 2, 
wherein the guide means for the adult seat belt (10, 104) 

comprises a respective detachable guide unit (92) adapted 
to be engaged by each attachment buckle (36). 
A child safety seat according to any preceding 
claim, further comprising releasable means (42, 140, 142) 

for securing each of the attachment buckles (36, 136) 
either in its first position or in its second position. 
A child safety seat according to claim 5, further 
comprising additional releasable means (138) for holding 

the attachment buckles (36) in an intermediate position in 
which the adult seat belt (104) is fastened, subsequent 

movement of the attachment buckles (36) into their second 
position being arranged to apply additional tension to the 

adult seat belt (104). 
A child safety seat according to any preceding  
 

claim, further comprising a third attachment buckle (22) 
mounted on a projection (20) extending forwardly and 

downwardly from the seat body (130) so as to be engageable 
with a third standard anchorage unit (24) disposed adjacent 

to the front edge of the seat portion and below the top 
surface thereof even when the seat cushion is compressed to 

its maximum extent.
