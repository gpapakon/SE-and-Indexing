<ABSTRACT>
A resonant circuit is used within an RF 
transistor package to significantly reduce the power level 

of an unwanted signal generated or amplified by the RF 
transistor without significantly affecting the performance 

of the RF transistor within its intended or specified 
range of operating frequencies. More particularly, an RF 

transistor device includes a multiplicity of parallel-connected 
transistors formed on a semiconductor chip and a 

chip carrier to which the semiconductor chip is bonded. A 
number of reactive elements are formed in contact with the 

chip carrier and connected to form a circuit network with 
the transistors. At least some of the reactive elements 

form a resonant trap to attenuate signals of a 
predetermined frequency range that would otherwise appear 

in an output signal of the circuit network.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to radio frequency 
(RF) transistors, and more particularly to apparatus for 
adjusting the frequency response of an RF transistor. RF transistors are used in RF amplifiers to 
amplify RF signals. In radio communications applications, 
in order to facilitate broadcast of a signal over long 
distances, RF transistors are required to operate at high 
power levels, for example, 50W. In practice, an RF 
transistor is typically connected to impedance matching 
circuitry to allow for more convenient impedance matching, 
the RF transistor and the impedance matching circuitry 
together forming an RF stage. Hereinafter, the term "RF 
transistor" will be used to refer to such an RF stage. Ideally, an RF transistor will, under 
appropriate operating conditions, produce as an output 
signal an exact replica of an input signal, amplified by a 
gain factor. In actual practice, however, the RF 
transistor produces unwanted signals including harmonics, 
half-frequency oscillations, intermodulation distortion, 
or some combination of the foregoing, resulting in an 
output signal that may differ significantly from the input 
signal. Filtering may be applied external to the RF 
transistor to reduce the unwanted signals. Such filtering 
is not always feasible or convenient, however, and can 
greatly increase the size and complexity of RF amplifiers. 
A need therefore exists for an RF transistor that enables  
 
the power level of an unwanted signal to be significantly 
reduced without significantly affecting the performance of 
the RF transistor within its intended range of operating 
frequencies. The present invention, generally speaking, uses 
a resonant circuit within an RF transistor package to 
significantly reduce the power level of an unwanted signal 
generated or amplified by the RF transistor without 
significantly affecting the performance of the RF 
transistor within its intended or specified range of 
operating frequencies. More particularly, an RF 
transistor device in accordance with the present invention 
includes a multiplicity of parallel-connected transistors 
formed on a semiconductor chip, and a chip carrier to 
which the semiconductor chip is bonded. A number of 
reactive elements are formed in contact with the chip 
carrier and connected to form a circuit network with the 
transistors. At least some of the reactive elements form 
a resonant trap to attenuate signals of a predetermined 
frequency range that would otherwise appear in an output 
signal of the circuit
