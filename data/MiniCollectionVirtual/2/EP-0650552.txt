<ABSTRACT>
A metal honeycomb body with intertwined, at least partly structured layers of sheet metal (3, 4) which are curved and especially rather involute. The body has at least three reversal lines (2a, 2b, 2c, ... or 7a, 7b, 7c, ...) in an outer annular region (6) and an inner annular region (5) about which the sheet metal layers (3, 4) are intertwined with directions of curvature changing from outside to inside. Such a body can be produced from a hollow winding by star-shaped deformation and the subsequent intertwining of the external about the internal sections and is therefore very easily manufactured. A long electrical conductor can also be integrated as a measuring probe or heat conductor. The mechanical advantages of a honeycomb with a plurality of curved layers of sheet metal running from the inside to the outside are retained. Such a honeycomb body is therefore to be preferred as exhaust gas catalyst support in motor vehicles.
