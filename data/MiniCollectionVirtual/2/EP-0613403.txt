<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a feed accelerator system for use
in a centrifuge according to the pre-characterizing portion of
claim 1.US-A-3,831,764 shows a pusher-type centrifuge comprising a
perforated outer rotor enclosing a rotating reciprocable inner
rotor providing a pusher member which in reciprocating advances
solids in axial direction along the perforated outer rotor towards
discharge. The outer rotor consists of a perforated cylinder open
at one end and of a perforated tapered section connected to the
other end of the cylinder, said tapered section tapering axially
away from the open end of the cylinder.The inner rotor consists of a hub at the end of the centrifuge
opposite to the open end of the cylinder. The inner rotor
further comprises a tapered portion of perforated construction
within the tapered section of the outer rotor with the same tapering
angle. The tapered portion of the inner rotor is connected at
its small end to the hub. The feed slurry is delivered to a zone
adjacent to the centre of the hub, which consists of a conical nut
which is connected to the hub by means of a stepped portion. From
this zone an annular passageway extends outwardly to the small end
of the tapered portion of the inner rotor. In this passageway a
plurality of annularily spaced and axially extending vanes is
arranged, which acclerate the feed slurry when flowing therethrough.
The feed slurry flowing through the passageway is subdivided
into several streams by the accelerator vanes and contacts an
annular structure on the inner rotor which extends axially into
the passageway thereby reforming the subdivided streams to an
annular stream before flowing from the small end to the large end
of the tapered portion of the inner rotor thereby reducing its
wear. US-A-4,334,647 discloses a centrifuge including a power exchange
rotor which is provided with at least one channel member for
guiding the flow of material therethrough from a first end exposed
to a source of the material, which is a feed source in a rotor
used as a feed accelerator and is material discharging from the
bowl treating zone in a rotor used in power recovery. The channel
is so formed as to change the direction of flow of the material at
least about 90 degrees as it flows therein to a discharge outlet
at the other end and is spaced from the rotor axis less than the
maximum radius of the bowl in the area of the treating zone. The
rotor is mounted for rotation at a rate such that the tangential
velocity of the channel ends is substantially less than
