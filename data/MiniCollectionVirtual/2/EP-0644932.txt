<DESCRIPTION>
The present application is related in subject matter to the
disclosure contained in International Patent Application Publication
No. WO 90/07572. The content of this prior application is hereby
expressly incorporated by reference herein.The present invention is related to results obtained from
research on deoxyribonuclease (DNase), a phosphodiesterase that is
capable of hydrolyzing polydeoxyribonucleic acid. It relates
generally to the separation of several forms of said DNase, to these
forms per se, to pharmaceutical compositions by which their utility
can be exploited clinically, and to methods of using these DNases and
compositions thereof.DNase is a phosphodiesterase capable of hydrolyzing
polydeoxyribonucleic acid. DNase has been purified from various
species to various degrees. The complete amino acid sequence for a
mammalian DNase was first made available in 1973. Seee.g., Liao, et
al., J. Biol. Chem. 248:1489 (1973).DNase has a number of known utilities and has been used for
therapeutic purposes. Its principal therapeutic use has been to
reduce the viscoelasticity of pulmonary secretions in such diseases as
pneumonia and cystic fibrosis, thereby aiding in the clearing of
respiratory airways. Seee.g., Lourenco, et al., Arch. Intern. Med.
142:2299 (1982); Shak, et al., Proc. Nat. Acad. Sci. 87:9188 (1990);
Hubbard, et al., New Engl. J. Med. 326:812 (1992).DNA encoding human DNase I has been isolated and sequenced and
that DNA has been expressed in recombinant host cells, thereby
enabling the production of human DNase in commercially useful
quantities. Seee.g., Shak, et al., Proc. Nat; Acad. Sci. 87:9188-9192
(1990). Recombinant human DNase (rhDNase) has been found to be
useful clinically, especially in purified form such that the DNase is
free from proteases and other proteins with which it is ordinarily
associated in nature. Seee.g., Hubbard, et al., New Engl. J. Med.
326:812 (1992).The means and methods by which human DNase can be obtained in
pharmaceutically effective form is described in the patent
applications cited above. Various specific methods for the
purification of DNase are known in the art. Seee.g., Khouw, et al.,
U.S. Patent No. 4,065,355 (issued 27 December 1977); Markey, FEBS 
Letters 167:155 (1984); Nefsky, et al., Eur. J. Biochem. 179:215
(1989).Although it was not appreciated at the time the above-referenced
patent applications were filed, the DNase product obtained from
cultures of recombinant host cells typically comprises a mixture of
deamidated and non-deamidated forms of
