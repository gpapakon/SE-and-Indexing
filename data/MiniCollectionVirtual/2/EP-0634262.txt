<ABSTRACT>
In an injection moulding machine, the movable platen (12) and a supporting element (13) for a clamping mechanism of a movable platen (12) are movably connected by means of a force-transmitting element, which absorbs the forces occurring when the mould is closed. Provided as the force-transmitting element is a separate deformable deformation element, which is rotatably mounted in the region of the supporting element (13) or clamping mechanism (S) and stationary platen (11). As a result, free access to the mould mounting space as and when required is ensured.
