<ABSTRACT>
Described is the use of erythropoietin (EPO) for 
the preparation of a pharmaceutical composition 

for pulmonary administration or inhalation. 
Aerosol administration of EPO in accordance with this 
invention results in significant elevation of red blood 

cell levels. EPO can be administered in this manner to 
medically treat or prevent anemia, as well as to treat 

or prevent other maladies related to erythropoiesis.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to the use of erythropoietin (EPO) for the preparation of a pharmaceutical composition
for pulmonary administration or inhalation.All mammals possess a hematopoietic (blood-forming) system that replenishes the multiplicity of blood cell
types found in a healthy animal, including white blood cells (neutrophils, macrophages, and basophil/mast cells), clot
forming cells (megakaryocytes, platelets), and red blood cells (erythrocytes). The average human male's hematopoietic
system has been estimated to produce on the order of 4.5 x 1011 granulocytes and erythrocytes every year, which is
equivalent to an annual replacement of total body weight [Dexter et al., (1985) BioEssays, vol. 2:154-158]. Current scientific
understanding proposes that small amounts of specific hematopoietic growth factors direct the proliferation, differentiation,
and maturation of each of the various hematopoietic cell types from a small population of pluripotent
hematopoietic stem cells. These various growth factors act at different times on different cell populations, ultimately giving
rise to a functional hematopoietic system.One specific and vital role of the mammalian hematopoietic system is the production of erythrocytes, or red
blood cells, which transport oxygen to the various tissues of the animal's body. The process of producing erythrocytes
("erythropoiesis") occurs continuously throughout an animal's life span to offset erythrocyte destruction. The typical red
blood cell has a relatively short life-span, usually 100 to 120 days; Gray's Anatomy, Williams et al. eds., Churchill Livingstone,
1989, p. 665. Erythropoiesis is a precisely controlled physiological mechanism whereby sufficient numbers of
erythrocytes are produced to enable proper tissue oxygenation, but not so many as to impede circulation.Erythropoiesis is now known to be primarily controlled by the polypeptide erythropoietin (EPO), an acidic glycoprotein.
Erythropoietin is produced as the result of the expression of a single copy gene located in a chromosome of
a mammal. A DNA molecule encoding a DNA sequence for human EPO has been isolated and is described in U.S. Patent
No. 4,703,008, and hereinafter referred to as the "Lin patent." Also, DNA molecules coding for EPO from monkeys
[Lin et al., (1986) Gene, vol. 44, pp: 201 - 209] and mice [McDonald et al., (1986) Mol. Cell Biol., pp: 842] have been
described. The amino acid sequence for recombinant human EPO ("rHuEPO") is identical to the sequence for EPO
obtained from human urinary
