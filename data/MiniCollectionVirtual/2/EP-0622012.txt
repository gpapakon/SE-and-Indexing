<ABSTRACT>
Mobile bale collector (1, 1'), comprising a frame 
(2), bale-carrying means (10, 10', 12, 20, 64), coupling 

means which are suitable for coupling the frame (2) to a 
mobile baler (6) in order to receive essentially block-shaped 

bales (50) onto the carrying means (10, 10', 12, 20, 
64) from a bale outlet (7) of the baler (6) via a front end 

- viewed in the direction of travel (3) - of the carrying 
means (10, 10', 12, 20, 64), blocking means (14, 15, 16) 

at a rear end of the carrying means (10, 10', 12, 20, 64), 
and locking means (30 - 38), in such a way that in a 

collecting state the blocking means (14, 15, 16) collect 
and retain a number of bales (50a, 50b) on the carrying 

means (10, 10', 12, 20, 64), and in an unloading state the 
locking means (30 - 38) release the blocking means (14, 15, 

16) in order to allow through and deposit on the ground 
bales (50a, 50b) collected on the carrying means (10, 10', 

12, 20, 64). The carrying means (10, 10', 12, 20, 64) are 
coupled to the frame (2) by means of first hinge means (11) 

which are disposed between the frame (2) and the rear end 
of the carrying means (10, 10', 12, 20, 64), the first 

hinge means (11) having an axis of rotation extending 
horizontally and at right angles to the direction of travel 

(3). Disposed between the frame (2) and the carrying means 
(10, 10', 12, 20, 64) are lifting means (21 - 24) which 

exert such a force on the carrying means (10, 10', 12, 20, 
64) that the front end of the carrying means (10, 10', 12, 

20, 64) is in a high position while receiving a bottom bale 
(50a), and the front end is subsequently in a low position 

for receiving a top bale (50b) on the bottom bale (50a).

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a bale collector as described
in the preamble of the claim 1.A bale collector of this type is disclosed by EP-A-0
108 277. With the bale collector disclosed by said document
the hinge means is located at the rear of the gravity
centre of the bale carrying means and is constituted - at
each side of the collector - by an upper roller of a pair
of rollers which can slide vertically in an U-profile.
Sensor means which are arranged at the rear of the collector
and which will be moved upwardly by the rear end of
each received bale, upon which the carrying means are
lowered by the height of a bale. A second and third bale
are received onto the first, second bale respectively. When
the rear end of the third bale engage the sensor means the
lower roller of said pair of rollers is enabled to pass
through an opening of said profile to the front, which will
occur since the pair of rollers are arranged in front of
the gravity centre of the combination of the carrying means
and the bales received thereon. As a result the carrying
means will tilt with the rear end thereof towards the
ground. Simultaneously, retaining means which are coupled
to the profiles and which urged against both sides of a
bale are released. Then, when because of the forward movement
of the bale collector the bales have slid from the
carrying means onto the ground, only the gravity centre of
the carrying means counts, so that the carrying means is
turned to a horizontal state. After that the driver must
activate a cylinder to lift the carrying means towards the
upper position thereof.In the tilted state of the carrying means of the prior
art bale collector the tilt angle of the carrying means
must be rather great and therefore the lowest position of
the lower roller must be rather high in order to enable the 
bales to slid onto the ground. Therefore the bale collector
cannot be used behind a baler having relatively low bale
outlet.In addition the prior art bale collector is complex
and is therefore expensive.It is an object of the invention to eliminate the
disadvantages of the prior art bale collector.To this end the invention provides a bale collector as
described in claim 1.By this the bale collector can be used with a baler
with a relatively low bale outlet. The bale collector has a
simple structure with lifting means, for example a
spring or even a counterweight. Therefore the bale collector,
when in use, does not need attention by the driver of
the baler or any additional control equipment. If the front end of the

64) which are coupled to the frame (2) by means of first

hinge means (11) having an axis of rotation extending
horizontally and at right angles to the direction of travel

(3), coupling means which are suitable for coupling the
frame (2) to a mobile baler (6) in order to receive a first

substantially block-shaped bale (50a) onto the carrying
means and a second such bale (50b) onto the first bale

(50a) from a bale outlet (7) of the baler (6) via a front
end - viewed in the direction of travel (3) - of the carrying

means, blocking means (14, 15, 16), locking means (30-38),
and lifting means (21-24) for lifting or lowering the

front end of the carrying means, such that in a collecting
state the blocking means (14, 15, 16) are locked by the

locking means (30-38) and retain received bales (50),
