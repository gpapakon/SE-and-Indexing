<ABSTRACT>
The electric storage heating apparatus has three tubular heating elements (11, 12, 13) which are led through the storage core chamber (1) and the adjoining heat insulation (2a, 2b) horizontally and parallel to one another. Each tubular heating element is equipped with two parallel heating spirals (14...19) which at one end are led to a switching wall (4) and at the opposite end are connected in series in pairs via bridge elements (21...23). By suitably changing the connections at the switching wall (4), the heating capacity can be changed in stepped fashion with optimal energy output.

Electric storage heater with a plurality of tubular 
heatin
g bodies whose electrical connections extend into 
a connection space and are switchable for the purpose of 

incrementally changing the heating output, characterised 

(a) in that at least one of the tubular heating bodies 
(11...13) is provided with a plurality of heating coils 

(14...19), which are arranged parallel or concentrically; 
(b) that at least one end of each heating coil extends 
into the connection space; and 
(c) that heating coils of at least two tubular heating 
bodies are connectable in series by a bridge (21...23) on 

the side of the tubular heating bodies remote from the 
connection space. 
Electric storage heater as claimed in claim 1, 
characterised in that a plurality of heating coils 

(16,17) of a tubular heating body (12) are connected in 
phase at one end of the tubular heating body. 
Electric storage heater as claimed in claim 1 or 2, 
characterised in that a plurality of tubular heating 

bodies (11...13) extend parallel to one another 
horizontally or vertically through the storage core space 

(1) and the adjoining thermal insulation (2a,2b). 
Electric storage heater as claimed in one of claims 
1 to 3, characterised in that the tubes of two adjacent 

tubular heating bodies (11...13) are connected together 
in the shape of a U by means of a curved tube at the side 

remote from the connection space.  
 
Electric storage heater as claimed in one of claims 
1 to 4, characterised in that the number n of the tubular 

heating bodies installed in an electric storage heater is 
three or a whole number multiple of three. 
Electric storage heater as claimed in one of claims 
1 to 5, characterised in that an additional heating rod 

is provided as a direct heater in the electric storage 
device and is constructed as a multistage tubular heating 

body. 
Electric storage heater as claimed in one of claims 
1 to 5, characterised in that at least one individual 

coil of the multistage tubular heating bodies provided 
for heating the core is connected as a direct heating 

coil and may also be acted upon by electric current 
outside the storage period. 
Electric storage heater as claimed in one of claims 
1 to 7, characterised in that the heating conductors 

(14...19) in the multistage tubular heating bodies 
(11...13) of a non-ferrous nickel chrome steel are 

provided with a diameter of at least 0.15mm. 
Electric storage heater as claimed in one of claims 
1 to 8, characterised in that each tubular heating body 

(11...13) has an outer protective tube of high heat-resistant 
steel with a wall thickness of at least 0.4mm. 
Electric storage heater as claimed in claim 8 or 9, 
characterised in that the end diameter of the protective 

tube is at least 8mm. 
Electric storage heater as claimed in one of claims  
 

1 to 10, characterised in that the tube dimensions of the 
tubular heating body protective tube are so matched to 

the heat output of the associated heating conductors that 
the surface loading of the protective tube is at most 

4W/cm
