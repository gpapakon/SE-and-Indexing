<ABSTRACT>
Vinyl carboxylates are prepared by reacting a carboxylic acid with acetylene in the presence of a platinum metal complex catalyst which contains, as ligands, carbon monoxide or a nitrile (I), a tertiary nitrogen base (2), a tertiary phosphorus compound having C- and/or O-organic radicals (III), or mixtures of these compounds. The process products are used as monomers or comonomers for polymer dispersions.

<CLAIMS>
A process for the preparation of vinyl carboxylates 
by reacting a carboxylic acid with acetylene in the 

presence of a platinum metal complex catalyst, wherein 
the platinum metal complex catalyst is a complex of a 

platinum metal and the ligands carbon monoxide, a nitrile 
(I), a tertiary nitrogen base (II) or a tertiary phosphorus 

compound containing C- and/or O-organic radicals 
(III), or a mixture of these ligands. 
A process as claimed in Claim 1, wherein the 
platinum metal is ruthenium. 
A process as claimed in Claim 1 or 2, wherein the 
ligands in the catalyst complex are nitriles of the 

formula Ia 

R - CN 
 
where R is C
1
- to C
4
-alkyl, cyclopentyl, cyclohexyl, 
phenyl, benzyl or 2-phenylethyl, where these radicals may 

also carry inert substituents. 
A process as claimed in Claim 1 or 2, wherein 
ligands in the catalyst complex are tertiary amines of 

the formula IIa 

 
where the radicals R may be identical or different and 

are as defined in Claim 3. 
A process as claimed in Claim 1, wherein the 
ligands in the catalyst complex are heteroaromatic 

nitrogen bases (IIb).  
 
A process as claimed in Claim 5, wherein the 
heteroaromatic nitrogen bases are pyridine or 

1,10-phenantroline. 
A process as claimed in Claim 1 or 2, wherein the 
ligands in the catalyst complex are tertiary phosphorus 

compounds containing C- and/or O-organic radicals, of the 
formula III 


 
where the radicals R may be identical or different and 

are as defined in Claim 3, and m, n and r are zero or 1. 
A process as claimed in any of Claims 1 to 7, 
wherein the catalyst complexe is one in which the ligands 

I to III are linked to a polymer.
