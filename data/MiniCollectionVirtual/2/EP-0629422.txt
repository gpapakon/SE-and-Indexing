<ABSTRACT>
Method and apparatus for the dehydration of liquid and gaseous media 
include the use of at least one coalescing bed filled with beads 

preferably graded in size. The beads have a smooth, non-absorbent, 
non-conductive and hydrophobic surface. The use of beads of this type 

substantially prevents irreversible contamination and clogging of the 
coalescing bed and significantly reduces channeling, especially when 

spherical beads are used. Dehydration of a gaseous medium can be 
achieved without using a counter current of a hydrophillic liquid.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to method and apparatus for the removal of 
water from a fluid medium containing suspended droplets of water by 
passing the fluid medium through a coalescing medium whereby the droplets 
are coalesced into a water phase which can be easily removed. More 
particularly, the invention is concerned with the breaking of "tight" 
oil-and-water emulsions and the separation of water entrained in a flow 
of natural gas. In oil fields, water is usually produced with crude oil or natural 
gas. Both must be free of water before they can be sold or shipped. 
Where the mixture has only "free" water, the water will readily separate 
under the influence of gravity. However, the water may be dispersed in 
very fine particles of less than 25 microns as in the case of a 
water-in-oil emulsion which is very difficult to separate. Emulsions can 
be broken either physically or chemically. Chemical separation is 
disadvantageous, since the separated water is contaminated with 
emulsifiers and, thus, cannot be readily disposed. During physical 
separation, those water particles which are too small to readily separate 
must be coalesced into larger droplets before they can be separated by 
the effect of gravity. Coalescing media used in traditional physical 
treatments include water saturated wood excelsior or hay, sand, 
diatomatious earth, fibrous webs formed of glass fibers, synthetic 
polymeric fibers or naturally occurring fibers, open pore foams or ground 
walnut shells. Common deficiencies of these treatments include a 
tendency to channel, failure to coalesce very small droplets, and 
especially a tendency toward fouling of the coalescing material by 
clogging with impurities, since, generally, most coalescers follow a 
filter approach. Conventional apparatus and coalescing media as described are 
disclosed in the following patents:  U.S. 3,491,882 (Elam)CA 826,478 (Bruinzeel et al.)

A method for separating an aqueous phase from a fluid, comprising the 
steps of: 

   providing a coalescing bed including a plurality of stacked beads having a non-conductive, 
non-absorbent and hydrophobic surface with a maximum surface roughness of 

about 1.6 µm Ra;

phase entrained therein for coalescing the aqueous phase; and 
   removing dewatered fluid exiting from the coalescing bed. 
A method as defined in claim 1, wherein at least two coalescing beds are 
provided which are positioned in series in direction of flow of the fluid for successive 

separation of the aqueous phase from the fluid, the dewatered fluid being removed only 
after having passed through all coalescing beds. 
A method as defined in claim 1 or 2, wherein the fluid is a liquid immiscible 
with water, further comprising the step of heating the stream of untreated fluid prior to 

entry into the coalescing bed. 
A method as defined in any of the preceding claims, further comprising the steps of collecting 

and removing water separated from the fluid. 
A method as defined in any of the preceding claims, wherein the fluid is a gas, further 
comprising the steps of: 

   passing a stream of a hydrophillic liquid through the coalescing bed in counter 
current to the stream of untreated fluid to cause the hydrophillic liquid to entrain water 

coalesced on the beads of the coalescing medium, and removing a mixture of hydrophillic 
liquid and water exiting the coalescing bed.

untreated fluid having the aqueous phase entrained therein; 
   input means for feeding the untreated fluid into the vessel; 

   the coalescing bed including a plurality of stacked beads having a non-conductive, 
non-absorbent and hydrophobic surface with a maximum surface roughness of about 1.6 

µm Ra, and the coalescing bed being positioned in the vessel so that all untreated fluid fed 
into the vessel by the input means passes through the coalescing bed.
