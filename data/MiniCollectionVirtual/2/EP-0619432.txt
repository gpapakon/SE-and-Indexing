<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to an installation with at least one liquid pump, especially water pump, preferably centrifugal pump, having an electric drive motor which is connected to a speed controller which is indirectly connected to the secondary distribution system. The main aspect of the invention is that there is connected to the secondary distribution system (N), especially directly, a mechanical or electronic two-point pressure controller or pressure limit value switch or electronic trigger (7), which can be switched on and off as a function of the pressure in the secondary consumer network and which communicates with an upwardly and downwardly adjustable speed controller (3) which can be switched on and off thereby. By means of said speed controller, when it is switched on, the motor and pump speed can be slowly or gradually raised to an upper limit (a) of the secondary distribution network pressure, as a result of which the delivery rate (Q) of the pump can similarly be raised slowly or gradually to an upper limit, and when it is switched off, the abovementioned speeds can be slowly or gradually reduced to a lower limit (b) of the secondary distribution network pressure, as a result of which the delivery rate (Q) of the pump can similarly be reduced slowly or gradually to a lower limit (mVe), and, if an upper limit (a) of the secondary distribution network pressure applies at the same time, the motor and pump speed can be reduced down to the standstill of motor and pump only if consumption is close to zero (Fig. 6, Fig. 7). Thus the complicated and expensive use of P, PI and PID controllers can be avoided. Moreover, according to the invention, the energy consumption and the wear and tear of drive motor and pump can be reduced.

An installation having at least one liquid pump, in particular water pump, preferably 
rotatory pump, which is driven by an electric motor, and an electric pressure limit 

switch (7) connected to the water supply network (N), which switch opens when an 
upper limit (a) of the pressure on the consumer side is exceeded and closes when the 

pressure on the consumer side falls short of a lower limit (e), characterized in that a 
speed controlling device (3), in particular a frequency converter having high-run and 

low-run ramps (figs. 6, 7) is connected in series between the output of the pressure limit 
switch (7) and the driving motor (2), which is how the motor speed and thus the pump 

capacity (Q) may be continuously increased by way of speed controlling device (3) till 
the upper pressure limit (a) has been reached when limit switch (7) is closed, and the 

motor speed and thus the pump capacity may be continuously reduced to standstill of 
the motor by way of speed controlling device (3) till the lower pressure limit (e) has 

been reached when limit switch (7) is open. 
The installation according to claim 1, characterized in that a transducer (9) for 
converting pressure into an electric variable, for instance electric current or voltage, is 

connected in series between the supply network (N) and the electronic two-point 
pressure controller or electronic threshold switch (7). 
The installation according to claim 2, characterized in that the transducer (9) and the 
electronic two-point pressure controller or threshold switch (7) are connected in such a 

way that they are electrically isolated from each other, in particular by means of an 
optoelectronic coupler. 
The installation according to any of claims 1 to 3, characterized in that, when two or 
several pumps are present, a separate speed controlling device is provided for each of 

them, which is connected to the supply network by way of a separate two-point 
pressure controller or pressure limit switch.  

 
The installation according to any of claims 1 to 4, characterized in that the speed 
controlling device, which, on switching-on and switching-off, continuously increases
