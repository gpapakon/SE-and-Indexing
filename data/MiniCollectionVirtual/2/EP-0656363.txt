<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a process for preparing a silane having a 
tertiary hydrocarbon group at the α position. The process comprises 

subjecting a Grignard reagent having a tertiary hydrocarbon group at the 
α position, e.g. a t-butylmagnesium halide or thexylmagnesium halide to 

reaction with chlorosilanes in the presence of a copper halide such as CuI, 
CuBr, CuCl or Li₂CuCl₃. By the process, the silanes having a tertiary 

hydrocarbon group at the α position can be obtained simply without use of 
any toxic substances as a catalyst.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to the preparation of a specific type of silane and 
more particularly, to a process for preparing a silane having a tertiary 
hydrocarbon group at the α position, such a silane being useful as a starting 
material for preparing silicone resins having a controlled refractive index and 
also as a surface water repellent for buildings, a silylating agent used to 
prepare medicines and an additive of a complex catalyst for polymerization of 
olefins. Known silanes having a tertiary hydrocarbon group at the α position 
include t-butylsilanes and thexylsilanes. It is known that t-butylsilanes are 
prepared according to a process using the reaction between chlorosilane and t-butyl 
lithium. It is also known that chlorosilane and a t-butylmagnesium 
halide as a Grignard reagent are reacted in the presence of a catalyst such as, 
for example, a CN or SCN group-containing compound (Patrick, J.L, David, 
P.M, and Quentin, E. T. , Organometallics. 1989, 8, 1121 and A Shirahata, IXth 
International Symposium of Organosilicone Chemistry, U. K., 1990, Abstract 2, 
14). For the preparation of the thexylsilanes, there is known a process wherein 
hydrosilanes and 2,3-dimethyl-2-butene are subjected to hydrosilation.  With the t-butylsilanes, intended silanes corresponding to starting 
chlorosilanes can be obtained using t-butyl lithium. However, since t-butyl 
lithium is expensive, the production costs undesirably become high. 
Accordingly, t-butylsilanes are now in use on an industrial scale only as a 
silylating agent for the preparation of medicines having a high value. Where inexpensive Grignard reagents are used, the reaction does not 
proceed at all only by use of the Grignard reagent, for which it is necessary to 
use, for example, a catalyst of a very toxic CN group-containing compound such 
as CuCN, AgCN, (C₄H₉)₃SnCN, BrCN, (CH₃)₃SiCN, Hg(CN)₂ or the like. 
Thus, the resultant silane products have the problem on safety. In addition, a 
further serious problem is involved from the standpoint of environment and 
health in view of the fact that cyan-containing waste products are secondarily 
produced in large amounts during the course of the preparation. Moreover, it 
is also known that a thiocyanate compound such as Ca(SCN)₂, AgSCN or 
(C₄H₉)NSCN, or an isothiocyanate compound such as (CH₃)₃SiNCS is used as 
the catalyst. However, these compounds are all toxic, coupled with another 
problem that the silanes obtained using these compounds are liable to assume 
an offensive odor inherent to
