<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a fire barrier for buildings, especially a fire door or window (2), with a frame (1, 3) in the wing or case region of a metal section (5), especially steel, in the interior of which there is a fire resistant material, in which the metal section (5) takes the form of a tray, generally C-shaped in cross-section with facing shank sections (10), the end regions of which are bent mutually parallel in the section interior (6) on the inside of the central C-arm (8) bounding the gap (13) between the case (1) and the wing (3), between the end regions (11) of which and bearing against them there is a plate of fire resistant material (7), the longitudinal face of which bears on the central C-arm (8). An easily and economically assembled fire barrier is produced in that at least the shank sections (10) of the wing frame (3) have an engagement device (11') which is hook-shaped in cross-section into which brackets (23) with corresponding hook components can be clipped, with the ends of the brackets (23) away from the hook components bearing on a pane of glass.

<CLAIMS>
A fire-protection barrier in a building, especially
a fire-protection door or window (2), with a frame

(1, 3) in the panel and/or surround area,
comprising a metal profile (5), especially a steel

plate profile, a fire-protection material (7) which
reacts endothermically on heating being disposed in

the profile interior (6), characterised in that the
metal profile (5) is designed in one piece as a

shell and is generally C-shaped with facing limb
sections (10), the end sections (11) of which are

bent approximately parallel to each other into the
profile interior (6) towards the interior side (12)

of the central web of the C (8) which borders the
gap area (13) between the surround (1) and the

panel (3), between which end areas (11) a plate of
fire protection material (7) is placed, resting

against these, which lies with its one longitudinal
face side on the central web of the C (8).
A fire protection barrier according to claim 1,
characterised in that a fire protection material

(15) which foams up under the influence of heat,
and which especially is formed in strips, is

disposed on the exterior side (14) of the central
web of the C (8) which faces the gap area (13)

between the panel (3) and the frame (1).
A fire protection barrier according to claim 1 or
2, characterised in that the central web of the C

(8) has two profile bulges (16, 17) projecting into
the gap area (13) between the panel (3) and the

surround (1), viewed in the direction of the two
connecting limbs (9) of the metal profile (5).
A fire protection barrier according to claims 2 and 
3, characterised in that the fire protection

material is included between the two profile bulges
(16, 17).
A fire protection barrier according to claims 3 or

4, characterised in that one (17) of the profile
bulges (16, 17) joins into a layered fold (18)

which is pre-bulged laterally into the profile
interior (6), whilst the other (16) goes over into

a laterally-projecting detent fold (19), viewed
from the profile interior.
A fire protection barrier according to claim 5,
characterised in that a groove (20), opened to the

gap area (13), is formed between the other profile
bulge (16) and the detent fold (19), in which a

detent seal (21), for example a lip seal,
especially made from a so-called self-extinguishing

material, can be placed.
A fire protection barrier according to one of
claims 1 to 6, characterised in that as a panel

frame, the frame (3) includes a fire protection
window pane (4) which is held by strips (23) which

grip on both sides of its edge via buffer seals
(22), these strips being held on the face sides of

the panel metal profile (5) which face away from
the gap area (13), preferably by clipping on the

heads of screws (24) which are screwed into the
limb sections (10) of the metal profiles (5) which

form the panel frame.
A fire protection barrier according to one of
claims 1 to 7, characterised in that the plate of

fire protection material (7) is held, with the help
of holding elements (25), in its position of

installation which it has attained by being pushed 
in from the side remote from the central web of the

C (8) of the metal profile (5) between the end
areas (11) thereof until it abuts on the interior

surface of the central web of the C (8).
A fire protection barrier according to one of
claims 1 to 8, characterised in that the end areas

(11) of the limbs (9) of the metal profile (5) abut
against the plate of fire protection material (7),

being shape-conditionally pre-tensioned.
A fire protection barrier according to one of
claims 1 to 8, characterised in that the plate of

fire protection material (7) is held resting
against the central web of the C (8) of the metal

profile (5) under pressure in its inserted state,
especially by means of bracket-like holding

elements (25) which act upon the longitudinal face
side of the plate (7) which faces away from the

central web of the C (8).
A fire protection barrier according to claim 1,
characterised in that at least the limb sections

(10) of the panel frame (3) have a click-stop
arrangement (11') which is hook-shaped in design,

into which bars (23) equipped with corresponding
hook elements can be clipped, or similar, wherein

the end of the bars opposite the hook elements (23)
abut against a window pane (4).
A fire protection barrier according to claim 11,
characterised in that the click-stop arrangement

(11') is formed as one piece with the panel frame
(3).
A fire protection barrier according to claim 11,
characterised in that the click-stop apparatus 

(11') is designed as a bar running over almost the
entire length of the panel frame (3).
A fire protection barrier according to claim 11,
characterised in that the limb sections (10) of the

surround frame (2) have a click-stop apparatus
(11') which is hook-shaped in cross-section.
A fire protection barrier according to claim 11,
characterised in that the hook element is

substantially S-shaped and abuts at least partially
on the limb section (10) on the one side and in the

click-stop apparatus (11') on the other side, being
lockable to these elements.
A fire protection barrier according to claim 15,
characterised in that the hook element additionally

abuts on the web which connects the click-stop
apparatus (11') to the limb section (10).
A fire protection barrier according to claim 11,
characterised in that the bar (23) comprises an

elastic material, preferably spring steel.
A fire protection barrier according to claim 14,
characterised in that corresponding anchors (27),

additional profiles (31) or other connecting
elements can be clipped into the click-stop device

(11') of the surround frame (1).
A fire protection barrier according to claim 11,
characterised in that the bars (23) in the panel

frame (3) are arranged circumferentially on the
window pane (4), wherein the bars (23) are mitre

cut in the joining area of two metal profiles (5)
which meet at right-angles.
