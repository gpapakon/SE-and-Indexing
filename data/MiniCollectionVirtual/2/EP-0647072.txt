<ABSTRACT>
In the case of a distributor device having connecting contacts for a large number of incoming and outgoing wires or cables, a large number of wire guidance blocks are used, which contain curved channels for threading the wires through. The channels have inlet openings on one side edge and their outlet openings on the top of the block. The device furthermore includes a large number of connecting strips for those wires which emerge from the channel outlet openings of adjacent blocks. Finally, the device also includes a linear carrier along which the blocks and the connecting strips are stacked alongside one another in an alternating sequence and are secured via integrally formed retaining means. After they have been secured, the blocks and strips run transversely with respect to the course of the carrier. For a space-saving device which is easy to operate, it is proposed to connect a pair of wire guidance blocks permanently to one another via end webs to form a box-shaped housing which is open towards the top of the housing. The upper opening, which is located there, of the housing is surrounded in a rectangular shape by the two wire guidance blocks and the two end webs. It forms a retaining socket for the insertion of a connecting strip which is assigned to the housing. The wires which are to be connected to this strip are threaded through the block channels on both sides of this housing. Only the housing is fitted with the retaining means which act directly on the carrier, while the retaining means which belong to the connecting strip act only on the housing. Together with the connecting strip coupled into it, the housing thus forms a structural unit which is held on the carrier as an entity via the retaining means on the housing side.
