<ABSTRACT>
The present invention provides DNAs originating 
in non-A non-B hepatitis virus genome gene and 

polypeptides constituting said virus, which enable the 
diagnosis of hepatitis induced by said virus. 
An RNA is extracted and purified from the plasma 
of a patient with non-A non-B hepatitis. By using 

this RNA as a template, a single strand DNA is 
prepared. Then, the DNA is amplified by the PCR 

method with the use of appropriately selected primers. 
The partial DNA sequence of the above-mentioned virus 

is identified by analyzing the structure and the 
constituting polypeptide of this virus is deduced. 

Thus, the antigen site is confirmed.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to polypeptides 
which relate to non-A non-B hepatitis virus and DNAs 
encoding for the same. Further, the present invention 
relates to reagents for detecting anti non-A non-B 
hepatitis virus antibody and non-A non-B hepatitis 
virus gene. Non-A non-B hepatitis is thought to amount to 
about 95 % of posttransfusive hepatitis at the present 
stage. Thus it has been urgently required to find out 
patients infected with non-A non-B hepatitis virus in 
order to exclude their blood from the blood to be 
transfused and to develop a vaccine for preventing 
this disease. Recently, Houghton et al. have reported 
the isolation of a gene of this virus [see European 
Patent Publication-A No. 318216 (published on May 31, 
1989)] and marketed a reagent for detecting anti non-A 
non-B hepatitis virus antibody with the use of this  
 
recombinant viral antigen. Although it is expected 
that posttransfusive non-A non-B hepatitis would be 
prevented by finding blood wherein anti non-A non-B 
hepatitis virus antibody is present with this antibody 
detection reagent and excluding such blood from the 
blood to be transfused. However, this hepatitis 
occurs at an incidence of 5 to 7 % even after 
excluding the blood of anti non-A non-B hepatitis 
virus antibody positive donors. Thus, this disease 
has not been exterminated yet. Indeed, one of the possible reasons therefor 
resides in the fact that the relation between the 
infection with this virus and the production of the 
antibody against this virus still remains 
unelucidated. However, another reason therefor 
resides in the finding that the nucleic acid sequence 
of the genome of this virus seemingly has a 
considerably high heterogeneity. This finding is 
based on the results of a number of experiments 
wherein c-DNA of this virus genome was cloned by the 
PCR method or the primer extension method based on the 
nucleic acid sequence reported by Houghton et al. [see 
Kubo et al., Nucleic Acid Research, 17, 10367 - 10372 
(1989); Kato et al., Proc. Japan Acad., 65B, 219 - 223 
(1989); Maeno et al., Nucleic Acid Research, 18,  
 
2685 - 2689 (1990); Kato et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. 
Sci. USA, 87, 9524 - 9528 (1990)]. Accordingly, it 
may not be concluded that the diagnosis of non-A non-B 
hepatitis and the prevention against the onset of non-A 
non-B hepatitis caused by transfusion have been 
brought to completion and it has been thus required to 
develop a novel diagnostic method therefor including 
gene diagnosis. Independently of Houghton
