<ABSTRACT>
A disposable panty shield (10) comprising a thin, highly 
absorbent pad having a body-contacting surface (11,12), an 

absorbent layer (16), a liquid barrier (17), an adhesive layer (18), 
and 

a release layer (19) to protect the positioning means prior to 
use wherein the panty shield has been densified by fusing 

all pad layers together in a manner such that the 
interstitial space between the individual fibers in the 

densified areas is not sufficient to readily allow fluid 
to flow through, and the liquid barrier (13) has a contoured 

surface. The adhesive layer is attached to the liquid 
barrier such that the adhesive follows the contour (20) of the 

liquid barrier (13).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an absorbent pad and
a process and an apparatus for manufacturing it.From US-A-4 023 570 there is known an absorbent pad comprising
an absorbent layer having a body contacting surface; an
adhesive layer; and a fluid impermeable, garment-side backing
layer between the absorbent layer and the adhesive layer;
wherein the absorbent layer is comprised of thermoplastic
fibers; wherein the absorbent layer and the backing layer are
thermally bonded to each other; wherein the garment-side
backing layer has a garment-side surface, which surface comprises
a recess defined by a recessed surface; and wherein the
adhesive layer is in contact with the recessed surface. From
this document there is further known a process for applying a
layer of adhesive onto a substrate having at least one surface
containing one or more recesses, wherein each recess comprises
a bottom surface that is not in the same plane as the surface
of the substrate, the process comprising the steps of:
a) applying the layer of adhesive to a transfer layer;b) bringing the adhesive layer into contact with the recess
containing surface of the substrate; andc) applying sufficient pressure to force the adhesive layer
into contact with the bottom surface of the recess.
Furthermore, said document discloses also an apparatus for
applying an adhesive layer to an absorbent product comprising
a pattern roll, and an anvil roll; wherein the pattern roll
has protuberances extending radially therefrom; wherein the
pattern roll, and the anvil roll, each have a longitudinal
axis around which each rotates; wherein the longitudinal axis
of the pattern roll, and the longitudinal axis of the anvil
roll, are parallel to each other. The pattern roll rotates in
a direction opposite the anvil roll, wherein the pattern roll 
rotates in a direction opposite the anvil roll, and wherein
the pattern roll is spaced apart from the anvil roll.US-A-3 673 060 discloses an apparatus for laminating a product
comprising a pattern roll, an anvil roll and transfer roll for
applying an additional layer to another layer. A transfer
layer is provided for applying said additional layer to the
other layer.These absorbent pads as related by the present invention are
very thin, lightweight and highly absorbent and are soft,
supple and conformable to the body and the garment to which it
is adhesively attached. More particularly, the article
comprises a garment side surface which contains recesses and
an adhesive layer which contacts and follows the contours of

An absorbent pad (10) comprising:

a) an absorbent layer (16) having a body contacting
surface (12) and being comprised od thermoplastic

fibers;
b) a fluid impermeable, garment-side barrier layer
(17);
c) an adhesive layer (18) and a release paper (19);
d) the absorbent layer (16) and the barrier layer (17)
are thermally bonded to each other to a substrate;
e) the garment-side barrier layer (17) of the substrate
has a garment-side surface, said garment-side

surface comprising at least one recess (20) having
a recessed surface (22) so that said recess (20)

defines a contiguous densified and depressed fluid
barrier pattern (13, 14, 14a) at least near the

periphery of the pad (10), and
f) the adhesive layer (18) is in contact with the
garment-side surface of the barrier layer and with

said recessed surface (22), whereby the adhesive
layer (18) follows the contour of the recessed

surface (22) so that
g) said fluid barrier pattern (13, 14, 14a) is made by
fusing all pad layers (16, 17, 18) together so that

the interstitial space between the individual fibers
in the barrier pattern (13, 14, 14a) is insufficient

to readily allow fluid to flow to the edges of the
pad (10).
The absorbent product (10) of claim 1 wherein the thermoplastic fibers of the absorbent
layer (16) and/or the cover (11) are comprised of

bicomponent fibers.
The absorbent product (10) of claim 2 wherein the absorbent
layer (16) is further comprised of pulp fluff. 
A process of maufacturing an absorbent pad (10)
comprising:


a) providing an substrate with an absorbent layer (16) 
and a fluid impermeable, garment-side barrier layer

(17),
b) the garment-side barrier layer (17) of the substrate
having a garment-side surface comprising at least

one recess (20) having a recessed surface (22) so
that said recess (20) defines a contiguous densified

and depressed fluid barrier pattern (13, 14, 14a) at

paper (19) and the bottom surface of the recess (20)

to force the adhesive layer (18) into contact with
the recessed surface (22) of the recess (20),

whereby the adhesive layer (18) follows the contour
