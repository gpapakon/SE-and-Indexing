<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a separator for separating mixtures of liquids, in which a particularly simple and effective partition arrangement (7) is arranged between an inlet (2) and an outlet box (5). The partition arrangement (7) is composed of staggered partitions (7a, 7b) which are arranged in such a way that a uniform flow results with subsequently circular motion substantially without turbulence in the tank (1).

<CLAIMS>
A separator for separating mixtures of liquids,
especially for separating light liquids of water,

consisting of a basin having an inlet (2), from which the
flow of liquid is introduced downwardly directed from the

basin edge, having an adjoining separating region (4), in
which the flow of liquid is deflected by a vertical

partition arrangement, and having an outlet box (5)
leading to the clarified water outlet, which box is in

communication with the separation region (4) via an
inflow aperture (5c) in a lower base plate (5b),
characterised in that
 the inlet is constructed as an
inlet (2) directing the flow of liquid downwardly and to

one side, to which is connected a partition arrangement
(7) having partitions (7a, 7b) in staggered relationship

to one another and disposed at right angles to the inlet
direction in the form of a labyrinth for introducing the

flow of liquid into a meandering uniform stream,
in that
 the outlet (7e) of the labyrinth passes directed
to the basin edge (1a) into a roughly circularly or

elliptically constructed separation region (4) in such a
manner that a spiral-shaped movement of the flow of

liquid in one direction (10) only is produced around the
inflow aperture (5c) of the outlet box (5),
and in that
 the cross section of flow from the inlet (2)
via the labyrinth and the separation region into the

inflow aperture (5c) of the outlet box (5) has a largely
uniform construction,
and in that
 the interior of the separation region (4) is
substantially free from parts interfering with the

spiral-shaped movement. 
A separator according to Claim 1,
characterised in that
 a guiding lug (3a) laterally
deflecting the flow of liquid is disposed on the inlet

box (2).
A separator according to Claim 1 or 2,
characterised in that
 the partition arrangement (7)
consists of at least two partitions (7a, 7b) extending to

the basin floor (1b), of which opposite side edges in
each case are attached to the basin edge (1a) on opposite

sides.
A separator according to Claim 3,
characterised in that
 the partitions (7a, 7b) of the
partition arrangement (7) are connected to one another by

connection means (7c) to form a unit,
and in that
 the side edges connected to the basin edge
(1a) are inserted into U-shaped mounting rails (8) which

are fixed to the basin edge (1a).
A separator according to one of the preceding Claims,
characterised in that
 the separator is a coalescence
separator,
and in that
 a cylindrically shaped filter body (9) is
mounted in the region of the inflow aperture (5c) of the

outlet box (5) on the base plate (5b).
A separator according to one of the preceding Claims,
characterised in that
 the partitions (7a, 7b) of the
partition arrangement (7) are made from special steel

sheets.
A separator according to one of Claims 4 to 6,
characterised in that
 the partitions (7a, 7b) of the
partition arrangement (7) are screwed to one another by

using spacers (7c). 
A separator according to one of Claims 1-7, in which
the basin is constructed as an upright cylinder,
characterised in that
 in the upper and central
region the outlet box (5) comprises a smooth end

wall (5a) lying opposite the inlet (2) and the
partition arrangement (7), which is constructed

roughly in the shape of a chord in the cross section
of the cylindrical basin (1).
A separator according to one of Claims 1 - 7,
characterised in that
 the basin (1) is constructed
as a vertically upright cuboid having longer

longitudinal walls (1c) and shorter transverse walls

(1d) of the base (basin floor 1b),

and in that
 the inlet (2) and the outlet box are
disposed at the opposite transverse walls (1d).
A separator according to Claim 9,
characterised in that
 in the upper and lower region
the outlet box (5) comprises a smooth end wall (5a)

opposite the inlet (2) and the partition arrangement
(7), which extends parallel to the transverse wall

(1d) and is provided with side walls (5d) inclined
to the separator chamber (4) to improve the flow.
A separator according to one of the preceding
Claims,
characterised in that
 the partitions (7a, 7b, 7c) of
the partition arrangement (7) are provided in their

region lying at the basin edge with side walls (5e)
extending at 45Â° to improve the flow.
