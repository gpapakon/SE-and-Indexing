<ABSTRACT>
The method of this invention allows use of a smaller wordline voltage 
Vp1 during programming. In addition, the method results in a relatively 

narrow distribution of threshold voltages Vt when used to flash program an 
array of memory cells (10). The method of this invention increases 

compaction gate-current efficiency by reverse biasing the source 
(11)/substrate (23) junction of the cell being programmed. The reverse 

biasing is accomplished, for example, by applying a bias voltage to the source 
(11) or by placing a diode (27), a resistor (29) or other impedance in series 

with the source (11). The reverse biasing limits the source current (Is) of cell 
being programmed and of the entire array during flash-programming 

compaction.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a nonvolatile, integrated-circuit 
memory array such as an electrically-erasable, electrically-programmable 
read-only-memory (EEPROM) array. In particular, the invention relates to a 
method for programming floating-gate memory cells. EEPROMs using hot-carrier-injection programming, as opposed to 
Fowler-Nordheim tunneling programming, are described in: (a) "A Single 
Transistor EEPROM cell and its implementation in a 512K CMOS 
EEPROM," S. Mukherjee et al., IEDM 1985 (p. 616-619) and in (b) "A 90ns 
100K Erase/Program Cycle Megabit Flash Memory," V. Kynett et al., ISSCC 
1989 (p. 140-141). The topic of reference (a) is also discussed in U.S. Patent 
No. 4,698,787. Using prior-art, hot-carrier-injection methods for programming, a 
reference voltage equal to the substrate voltage (Vss, which is perhaps 0V) is 
applied to the source of the cell to be programmed, a first positive voltage 
Vdd, perhaps 6V to 8V, is applied to the drain, and a second positive voltage 
Vp1, perhaps 12V, is applied to the control gate. Under those conditions, the 
channel between source and drain is highly conductive, the drain diffusion 
junction is reverse-biased with respect to the substrate (channel) while the 
source diffusion junction is not reverse-biased. Electrons reaching the drain 
diffusion are subjected to two electric fields, one associated with the reverse-biased 
drain diffusion junction and the other associated with the positive 
voltage coupled from the control gate to the floating gate. The electric fields 
cause electrons (hot carriers) to be injected into the floating gate. One of the problems arising in flash EEPROMs is over-erasure of cells. 
An over-erased cell has a positive charge, causing the channel under the 
floating gate to be conductive. That over-erased conductive cell short circuits 
other cells in its column of parallel-connected cells. One method to 
compensate for over-erasure is to form the flash EEPROMs with split gates. 
Another method is to program all of the EEPROM cells, then apply light 
erasing pulses in steps, checking after each step to see whether or not all of 
the cells are erased.  Other methods include applying alternating programming and erasing 
steps as described, for example, in U.S. Patent No. 5,132,935 issued July 21, 
1992, and in U.S. Patent No. 5,122,985 issued August 16, 1992 and the 
references therein. Both patents relate to compaction, or narrowing, of the 
threshold voltage distributions of flash erased cells and both patents
