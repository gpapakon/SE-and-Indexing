<ABSTRACT>
The forklift controller (25) changes the speed of the 
actuator, corresponding to the operational angle of the lift 

lever (22), and then changes the vehicle speed, corresponding to 
the amount of depression of an accelerator (24). This allows the 

controller to control the throttle opening corresponding to 
the operational angle of the lift lever, and together controls 

the amount of depression of the accelerator. During 
running without being loaded, the forklift controller 

changes the vehicle speed, corresponding to the amount of 
depression of the accelerator, and together determines 

the number of revolutions of the engine to the 
throttle opening so that the optimum fuel consumption can be 

obtained. The controller controls the throttle opening and 
speed ratio so that the vehicle speed and number of revolutions 

of the engine can be controlled.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a forklift controller
according to the preamble of claim 1 or 10. Such a forklift
controller is known from the DE-A-35 08 155.From DE-A-35 08 055 one can learn that inherent to
speed controlled diesel engines with a certain throttle
opening the speed is always constant, whatever the corresponding
control mechanism is. No throttle control is required
since with a certain throttle opening the speed is always
constant due to the internal speed control of diesel
engines. From this one can conclude to employ a speed controlled
diesel engine with a forklift in order to make sure
that the engine speed and thus the operation speed of the
forklift always correspond to a certain setting which in
turn corresponds to a certain throttle opening.However, this technical solution of maintaining the
lifting operation speed of a forklift at a target value will
not work in case of changing conditions of the road on which
the forklift travels. Namely, the speed of the engine with
the known forklift controller remains constant with a certain
throttle opening only if the changing load does not
exceed a maximum.A further ordinary example of a conventional forklift
controller has a configuration wherein the output shaft of
the engine and the wheel are connected via a stagged transmission
having a sliding factor. A lifting driving actuator
of the lift cylinder is connected to the output shaft of the
engine via a fixed pump. In addition, this controller is
equipped with an accelerator pedal directly connected to the
throttle valve of the engine and a clutch pedal (for a forklift
truck with an automatic transmission, this is referred
to as an inching pedal) as an interconnection means of the
wheel to the output shaft of the engine through operation of
the sliding factor, thus adjusting the vehicle speed and
lifting speed via these two pedals.Specifically, only during a lifting operation in a
stopped position, the lifting speed is adjusted by an amount
of depression of the accelerator pedal when the clutch is 
released. Also, the vehicle speed is adjusted by the amount
of depression of the accelerator pedal only when running/moving
after the lifting operation at a stopped position
when the clutch pedal is connected.However, with this type of forklift, in many cases, the
vehicle body is moving at a desirable speed when the lift is
elevated, that is, moving while lifted. The forklift equipped
with the conventional controller adjusts both the vehicle
speed and lifting speed through the stepping
