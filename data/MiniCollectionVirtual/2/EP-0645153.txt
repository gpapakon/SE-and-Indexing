<ABSTRACT>
An article of manufacture (10) adapted to be 
connected to a male thread comprises an exterior 

surface (12), a cavity (14) opening away from the 
exterior surface (12) and defining an interior 

surface (16), and a plurality of ribs (18) disposed 
on the interior surface (16) extending 

longitudinally away from the exterior surface (12). 
The article (10) can be connected to the male thread 

by threading the cavity (14) onto the male thread. 
It is a particular advantage that the article of 

this invention, unlike prior art female threaded 
articles, can be prepared by conventional simple 

injection molding techniques not requiring an 
unscrewing step. In one preferred embodiment, the 

article is a plunger rod (10) intended to be 
connected to the male threaded post (20) of a 

plunger (22) of an associated cartridge-needle unit 

to form a syringe assembly.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to articles intended to 
be connected to a male thread. In one particular 
embodiment, this invention relates to a plunger rod 
intended to be connected to the male-threaded post 
of a plunger of an associated cartridge-needle unit 
to form a syringe assembly. It is well known to manufacture articles, 
particularly plastic articles, by injection molding 
techniques. Such techniques are in widespread 
commercial use. In a conventional simple injection 
molding process two halves of a mold get clamped 
together under pressure. The molds form a cavity 
having the desired shape of the article to be 
fabricated. A molten fluid, e.g. molten plastic, is 
then injected through a tiny orifice or gate into 
the cavity until the cavity is filled. Next, the 
article is permitted to solidify during a so-called 
cure phase. After curing, the molds are separated 
and the article is ejected, usually with the 
assistance of an ejection device. This completes a 
cycle which is then repeated, desirably at high 
speeds. Short cycle times are highly desired 
primarily from the standpoint of the economies of 
manufacturing. Such injection molding techniques work well for 
many articles. However, articles of particular 
shapes can pose substantial or even insurmountable 
problems with respect to manufacture by injection 
molding. For example, articles intended to be 
threaded onto a male thread and containing internal 
threads, i.e. female threads, require that the 
article be unscrewed from the mold. In practice, 
this is typically accomplished by unscrewing the 
mold from the article in order to remove the article  
 
from the mold without damage to the threads. 
Although unscrewing mechanisms for injection molds 
are known, they are extremely capital-intensive, 
costly to maintain, and add significantly to the 
complexity of the injection molding process. 
Perhaps more significantly, the unscrewing step is 
relatively time-consuming, resulting in lengthy 
cycle times, which leads to manufacturing 
diseconomies. It would be desirable to be able to provide 
articles which, like conventional internal female 
threaded articles, can be connected to male threads 
and which can be prepared in a simple injection 
molding process not requiring a complex unscrewing 
step or long cycle time. It has now been discovered that injection 
molded articles containing internal, i.e. female 
threads, which heretofore required a step in which 
the article is unscrewed from the mold, can be 
designed such that they can be
