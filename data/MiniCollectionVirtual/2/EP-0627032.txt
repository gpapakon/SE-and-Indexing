<DESCRIPTION>
This invention pertains to a yellow retroreflective pavement marking 
that is substantially free of pigments that contain cadmium, chromium, and 
lead. Yellow and white pavement markings are commonly used on roadways 
to display traffic lanes. A yellow pavement marking will typically have a 
different meaning to an automobile driver than a white pavement marking. 
For example, in the United States of America (USA) a yellow pavement 
marking is used on a roadway to separate traffic lanes where the traffic moves 
in opposite directions; whereas a white pavement marking is used (i) to mark 
the roadway's border at the shoulder, and (ii) to separate traffic lanes where 
the traffic moves in the same direction (for example, a one-way street). In 
view of these different functions, it is very important that yellow and white 
pavement markings are discernible to automobile drivers, particularly at 
nighttime when visibility is limited. Otherwise, driver confusion may result, 
creating unsafe driving conditions. Yellow pavement markings have been made, which are distinctly 
discernible from white pavement markings under both daytime and nighttime 
conditions. A typical yellow pavement marking contains clear colorless 
retroreflective beads partially embedded in a yellow base. The base is made 
yellow by use of yellow pigments that contain heavy metals such as cadmium, 
chromium, or lead (see e.g. U.S. Patents 2,574,971, 2,268,537, 3,337,483, 
4,117,192, 4,248,932, 4,564,556, 4,931,414, Japanese Patent Kokoku 
20424/91 and EP 0,305,579 B1). During the daytime, the base diffusely 
reflects yellow light to display a yellow marking to automobile drivers. At 
nighttime, the beads reflect light back in the direction from which it came 
(retroreflect). This retroreflected light is yellow because it strikes the heavy-metal 
pigments in the base adjacent to the retroreflective beads. The heavy-metal 
pigments diffusely reflect yellow light back into the beads. The beads 
then redirect the diffusely scattered yellow light and send it back in the 
direction of the light source. Cadmium, chromium, and lead-based pigments have provided good 
yellow retroreflective pavement markings. Under both daytime and nighttime 
conditions, the pavement markings are distinctly yellow in appearance. These  
 
heavy-metal pigments strongly scatter light because they have a high index of 
refraction and a particle size on the order of magnitude of the wavelength of 
light. The pigments provide a distinct yellow color by absorbing the

A retroreflective pavement marking, which is free of cadmium, chromium, and 
lead and comprises: 


(a) a bead-carrier medium that contains a yellow colorant and at least 0.5 volume percent of a light-scattering 
agent that scatters white light and has an index of refraction greater 

than 1.6, the volume percent of the light scattering agent being based on solids 
of the bead-carrier medium excluding beads and anti-skid particles; and 
(b) a plurality of yellow tinted retroreflective beads at least partially 
embedded in the bead carrier medium. 
The retroreflective pavement marking of claim 1, wherein the 
plurality of retroreflective beads have a yellow tint that provides the 

retroreflective pavement marking with a distinct yellow nighttime color that 
has a sum of chromaticity coordinates x and y greater than 0.95 when tested 

according to ASTME 811-87, the pavement marking also exhibiting a specific 
luminance greater than 150 millicandela per square meter per lux when tested 

according to ASTM D 4061-89. 
The retroreflective pavement marking of claims 1 or 2, wherein 
the light-scattering agent has an index of refraction greater than 2, is present 

in the bead-carrier medium at 0.5 to 15 volume percent, and includes pigment 
particles that have average sizes ranging from 0.1 to 2 micrometers. 
The retroreflective pavement marking of claims 1, 2, or 3, wherein 
the light-scattering agent includes pigment particles selected from the group 

consisting of zinc oxide, zinc sulfide, lithophone, zircon, zirconium oxide, 
barium sulfate, titanium dioxide, and combinations thereof. 
The retroreflective pavement marking of any of claims 1-4, wherein 
the TiOâ‚‚ pigment particles are present in the bead-carrier medium at 0.5 to 

10 volume percent, and have particle sizes ranging from 0.2 to 0.8 
micrometers. 
The retroreflective pavement marking of any of claims 1-5, wherein 
the retroreflective beads have greater than one weight percent of a tinting 

agent incorporated therein.  
 
The retroreflective pavement marking of any of claims 2 to 6 having 
chromaticity coordinates that fall within a box defined by points (0.458, 

0.492), (0.480, 0.520), (0.610, 0.390), and (0.560, 0.390). 
The retroreflective pavement marking of claim 7 having 
chromaticity coordinates that fall within a box defined by points (0.467, 

0.503), (0.480, 0.520), (0.610, 0.390), and (0.580, 0.390). 
The retroreflective pavement marking of any of claims 1 to 8, which exhibits 
a specific luminance which is at least 40 percent of the specific luminance of 

an equivalent white pavement marking. 
A method of making a retroreflective pavement marking which 
is free of cadmium, chromium, and lead, said method comprises: 


(a) providing a bead-carrier medium that contains a yellow colorant 
and at least 0.5 volume percent of a light-scattering agent that scatters white 

light 
and has an index of refraction greater than 1.6; and 
(b) embedding retroreflective beads in the bead-carrier medium, the 
retroreflective beads having a yellow tint so that when light strikes the yellow-tinted 

retroreflected beads the pavement marking retroreflects a distinct yellow 
color.
