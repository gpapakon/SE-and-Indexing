<ABSTRACT>
An improved venturi eductor (10) for proportional dispensing of chemicals into flowing water includes a large antisiphoning air gap section (17) to satisfy water system regulations. The air gap section includes an outer wall (31) and an inner wall (36) with a gap (45) between the walls. Both walls include offset windows (33 and 39) that provide a circuitous path from the center of the air gap to the exterior of the unit. Passageways (35) extend from the gap to a downstream section of the unit to carry away fluid that might collect in this gap. Further, the shape and location of various orifices within the device creates a slight suction to further limit overspray.

<DESCRIPTION>
CHEMICAL EDUCTOR WITH INTEGRAL ELONGATED AIR GAPThis is a continuation-in-part application, Serial No. 07/732,469, filed July 18, 1991, entitled "Chemical Eductor With Integral Elongated Air Gap." Background of the InventionIt is a common practice for chemicals such as those used for cleaning and sanitizing to be purchased as concentrated liquids. The chemicals are mixed with water to achieve the desired usage concentration. A variety of proportioning dispensers have been developed to achieve this. These dispense mixtures at use concentration. The dispensers often employ venturi devices sometimes called eductors to proportion the chemical and deliver this for use. Water traveling through the central portion of the venturi creates suction which draws the chemical into the water stream. The amount of chemical educted is controlled by a metering orifice in the chemical feed line.The concentrations desired in this type of chemical dispensing varies greatly ranging from 1: 1 to over 1: 1000. The devices also must 

function with a wide range of water pressures, temperatures and dissolved minerals and gases. In some of these conditions, the eductors function much like classical flow venturies, while in other they are more like jet pumps.The devices are mechanically simple, generally without moving parts, but small details of the construction have important influence on their performance.It is usually desirable to operate these dispensers with water provided directly from the public water supply. In this situation, the dispensers are subject to the regulations of the public water departments who are concerned about preventing any possibility of the chemical concentrates entering the water system. Such an event is known as back flow when caused by positive pressure, back syphoning when the flow is caused by suction in the water system.A variety of devices and techniques exist to prevent backflow and back syphoning. The most effective mechanical backflow devices and the ones most accepted by the public water departments are relatively large, expensive devices which require regular testing and certification. The installation and inspection of these devices is often more expensive than the acquisition and installation of the dispensers themselves.The regulations regarding backflow and back syphoning and the research supporting them generally recognize the simple air gap is the most effective protection of all. The simplest illustration of an air gap is a faucet whose end is above the top of the sink. If there is
