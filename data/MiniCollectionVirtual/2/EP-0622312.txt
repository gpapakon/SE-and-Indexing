<ABSTRACT>
1. A wrapper made of thin card for a multiplicity of small cuboid boxes, in particular cigarette boxes (10). 2.1. In order to accommodate cigarette boxes (10) of smaller dimensions, namely height, in a wrapper having standard, that is to say larger outer dimensions, a bottom wall (23) is set back inwards corresponding to the height of the cigarette boxes. A free compensating chamber (26) is produced below the bottom wall (23). 2.2. The compensating chamber (26) which is open at the bottom is surrounded all-around by a dual-walled edge.

Bundle pack made from thin cardboard for a 
plurality of cuboid small packs, especially cigarette 

packs (10), which completely fill an inner space, namely 
a pack chamber(12), characterized in that, in the region 

of a bottom wall (23) or underneath the latter, a downwardly 
open compensating chamber (26) extending over the 

entire face of the bottom wall (23) is formed, in such a 
way that the outer dimensions of the bundle pack are 

clearly larger than the pack chamber (12). 
Bundle pack according to Claim 1, characterized 
in that side walls, namely a front wall (18) and rear 

wall (19), extend over the entire height, including the 
compensating chamber (26). 
Bundle pack according to Claim 2, characterized 
in that the bottom wall (23) is connected to a respective 

lower edge cant (24, 25) of the front wall (18) and rear 
wall (19) via connecting strips (27, 28), the connecting 

strips (27, 28) bearing on the free region of the front 
wall (18) and rear wall (19) and preferably being connected 

to these.

in that end walls (29, 30) extend over the entire height 

of the bundle pack, including the compensating chamber 
(26), especially by means of an outer tab (33) of 

corresponding dimension. 
Bundle pack according to Claim 4, characterized 
in that the end walls (29, 30) are made two-ply in part 

regions, especially in the region of the compensating 
chamber (26), by means of end tabs (31) connected to a 

front wall (18) and inner tabs (32) which are connected  
 

to the bottom wall (23) and which extend on the inside of 
the outer tabs (33). 
Bundle pack according to Claim 5, characterized 
in that the end tab (31) and the inner tab (32) have 

mutually confronting oblique cants (35, 36) which are at 
a distance from one another, in particular form a divergent 

gap (37), in the region of the compensating chamber 
(26). 
Bundle pack according to Claim 4, characterized 
in that the end walls (29, 30) are made two-ply in the 

region of the compensating chamber (26) by means of end 
tabs (31a) connected to a front wall (18) and outer tabs
