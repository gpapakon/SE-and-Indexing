<ABSTRACT>
This invention relates to a polyester composition containing particles of a cross-linked polymer having an ester bond in the 
principal chain. These particles have excellent affinity for polyester. Accordingly, in a film molded from polyester containing 

these particles, the particles hardly come off during a high-speed travelling of the film, and flaws ascribed to the particles also 
hardly occur on the film surface. Therefore, the deterioration of a film due to the occurrence of white powder thereon which is 

ascribed to the falling of the particles, which has posed problems when various kinds of particles were added, and due to the 
flaws on a magnetic surface can be prevented. Moreover, the contamination of the film manufacturing processes can be prevented, 

and the film thus obtained can be used suitably as, especially, magnetic tape.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to films made from polyester compositions
excellent in abrasion resistance and magnetic surface flawing preventability when the films run
at high speeds.In general, polyesters such as polyethylene terephthalate are excellent in mechanical
properties and chemical properties, and are widely used as formed products such as films and
fibers. When the polyesters are processed and used as formed products, their slipping property
and abrasion resistance greatly affect the workability in their production and various
applications. For example, if a polyester tape insufficient in such properties is used as a base
film for producing a magnetic tape, the friction between the coating roll and the film during
magnetic tape production becomes large, to wrinkle or scratch the film. Moreover, the film is
liable to be abraded to generate powder, and when the film is coated with a magnetic layer, it
may have portions devoid of the magnetic layer, and as a result, missing of magnetic recording
(drop-out) is likely to occur. Furthermore, as a recently identified disadvantage, when the film
is wound after completion of calendering in the step of magnetic layer coating, the magnetic
face is rubbed by the non-magnetic face, to be flawed, for causing quality deterioration such as
drop-out in use as a product. For improving the slipping property of a film, many proposals have been made for
letting polyesters contain inorganic particles such as titanium dioxide, calcium carbonate and
silicon dioxide. However, these inorganic particles which are low in affinity to polyesters
easily fall off, producing scrapings, degrading in slipperiness or suffering from flaws on the
surface, when an external force acts during use, for example, as a film, due to contact with rolls
during calendering in the step of magnetic layer coating or during film running or due to interlayer
contact of the film during winding. If such scrapings are produced in large amounts or
the surface is flawed, it would lead to imperfect formation of the magnetic layer during the
coating process and the film may suffer from drop-outs during use. Furthermore, if the
calender roll used in the step of magnetic layer coating is soiled, the workability in the
production of magnetic recording film is remarkably lowered. Thus it has been hoped that the
properties of these magnetic layers may be improved so that they do not suffer from flawing
and abrasion due to low affinity to polyesters.Methods proposed for improving the affinity between the
