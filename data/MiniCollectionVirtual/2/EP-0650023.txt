<ABSTRACT>
With a fin width FW in the air-flow direction, fin 
thickness FT, fin pitch FP, fin height FH, and tube element 

height TW, dimensional relationships are 50mm ≦ FW ≦ 65mm, 
0.06mm ≦ FT ≦ 0.10mm, 2.5mm ≦ FP ≦ 3.6mm, 7.0mm ≦ FH ≦ 

9.0mm, and 2.0mm ≦ TW ≦ 2.7mm. Provided are an optimum 
fin shape and tube element thickness in which a heat exchange 

efficiency and an air-flow resistance are well balanced, 
thereby ensuring an improvement in the heat exchange 

efficiency and the reduction in size of the heat exchanger.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates generally to an
evaporator formed by a multilayered heat exchanger consisting of a plurality of
alternatively layered fins and tube elements according to the preamble of claim 1.JP-A-2287094 discloses a multilayered heat exchanger
having fins and flat tubes the number of which is
gradually decreased downstream to increase performance
whilst reducing air and passage resistance. A similar
heat exchanger having flat tubes and corrugated fins is
disclosed in US-A-5076354.In a heat exchanger having fins and tube elements
alternatively layered, a heat exchange medium flowing
within the tube elements transfers its temperature to the
fins, to heat exchange principally by way of the fins
with air passing through the spaces defined by the
adjacent tube elements. Heat exchangers of the type
which has been hitherto manufactured by the present
applicant had a fin width FW in the air-flow direction of
74 mm, fin thickness FT of 0.11 mm, fin pitch FP of 3.6
mm, fin height FH of 9.0 mm, and a tube element thickness
TW of 2.9 mm. An investigation performed by the present
applicant has revealed that for the products by the other
manufacturers, the fin width FW in the air-flow direction
lies within a range 64 mm to 110 mm, the fin thickness FT
0.10 mm to 0.12 mm, the fin pitch FP 3.4 mm to 4.5 mm,
the fin height FH 8.0 mm to 12.3 mm, and the tube element
thickness TW 2.8 mm to 3.4 mm, which will cover the heat
exchanger of the present applicant.US-A- 5 024 269 granted to the
present applicant discloses an evaporator
substantially according to the preamble
of claim 1 of the present application
and is considered to be the closest prior
art document. Although it is believed for the heat exchanger that its
heat exchange efficiency can be improved by increasing
contact areas between the fins and air, if the distances
between the adjacent tube elements (or fin height) are increased
to enlarge the surface areas of the fins, the heat
exchange efficiency will be impaired. Also, if the distances
between the adjacent tube elements are reduced to
lessen the fin pitch, the air-flow resistance will be increased
to impede the flow of air. Nevertheless, while
considering not only the improvement in the heat exchange
efficiency but also the reduction of the air-flow resistance,
the demands to improve the performance of the heat
exchanger and reduce the size thereof must be satisfied,
which will need a still further improvement of the heat
exchanger.The present invention was conceived to overcome the
above
