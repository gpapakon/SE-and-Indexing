<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a circuit switch
connected between transmitting and receiving devices and
comprising
a switch memory including a number of memory positions
for entering of received time slots from said transmitting
devices, a control memory including a number of memory positions
for entering read-out addresses for said switch memory,an addressing path from said control memory to said
switch memory for a read-out address in the latter, from
which read-out of data shall be made towards a receiving
device,a control unit for entering said read-out addresses in
said control memory and for receiving information from said
devices related to the connect and disconnect of calls.Such a switch is known from EP-A-0 414 950.In switches it is a problem to generate idle codes for
disconnected calls. It is important to have a known idle
code, e.g. for a processor connected to the switch. If the
processor does not have any known idle code it implies in
general that the processor cannot distinguish between valid
through connected signals and garbage. Moreover it can imply
problems to synchronise when a real signal once arrives.Examples of idle codes are µLAG, aLAG, X25-FLAG, X25-RESET.A usual method to solve the problem is to switch to a
predefined homing position or not to take any action at all
in the switch. In the latter case the receiver must use a
code of its own as far as required. This will work well
enough in the cases where telephone subscribers are connected
or when a terminal connected to the switch can generate idle
codes for e.g. trunks. In cases where switching is made to a
predefined homing position a specific device is required for
each requested idle code only for this service. In US 4 718 062 a telecommunication system is described
in which circuit switched data and packet data are
communicated. The transmitting device includes a first memory
with channels corresponding to respective time slots. Each
channel includes status information for indicating whether
that channel is in a busy or idle status. Further there is a
second memory.A multiplexor sequentially scans the channels in the
first memory within the respective time slots and is
dependent on status information in each channel for
recovering data from the first memory within a time slot when
the status information indicates that a channel is busy and
for recovering data from the second memory within a time slot
when the status information indicates that the channel is
idle.In EP 250 160 a system is described where circuit
switched
