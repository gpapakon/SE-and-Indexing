<ABSTRACT>
Disclosed is a silver halide color photographic light-sensitive 
material comprising a reflective support comprising 

polyolefin resin coated paper and provided on one side thereof 
with photographic component layers comprising a hydrophilic 

colloidal layer containing a white pigment, a non-sensitive 
hydrophilic colloidal layer, and a silver halide emulsion 

layer, wherein at least one of said photographic component 
layers contains an oil-soluble dye or a colored pigment, 

either of which is not substantially 
decolorized on a photographic-processing.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to an improvement of a color
photographic light-sensitive material and, particularly, to an
improvement of an image reproducibility of the highlight
portions of the light-sensitive material. Inter alia, this
invention also relates to a silver halide color photographic
light-sensitive material suitable for preparing a color image
for making a proof from a plurality of black-and-white
halftone-dot images obtained by making a color-separation and
a halftone-dot image conversion in a color plate-making and
printing process and, further; this invention relates to an
image-forming (or color proof-forming) process in which the
above-mentioned silver halide color photographic light-sensitive
material. A color image is usually obtained in the following
manner. A color light-sensitive material is applied with a
color reproduction in a subtractive color system having
generally been used. After exposing imagewise the light-sensitive
material to light, the exposed silver halide grains
thereof are developed with a color developer. The oxidant
produced of a color developing agent is reacted with each of
yellow, magenta and cyan dye couplers. Next, a color image
can be obtained by bleach-fixing and then by washing or
stabilizing the light-sensitive material.Such a color image obtained as mentioned above has been
required to be improved in image quality and, particularly, in
the color tone of a highlight portion and in image background.Besides the above, a technique making use of an anti-irradiation
dye and a technique making use of a black
colloidal silver have been disclosed for
improving an image-sharpness. However, these techniques have
had problems such that sensitivity is seriously lowered,
and that stain may remain in a white background after
completing the process. For the purpose of preventing image-sharpness
deterioration from a reflective support, Japanese
Patent Publication Open to Public Inspection (hereinafter
referred to as JP OPI Publication) Nos. 54-46035/1979, 2-28640/1990
and 3-89340/1991, and JP Examined publication Nos.
59-820/1984 and 2-29203/1990, for example, disclose light-sensitive 
materials in which the filling factor of a white
pigment is increased in a resin-coated layer of the base paper
of the above-mentioned reflective support, or a hydrophilic
colloidal layer containing a white pigment is provided.
However, these light-sensitive materials have been
proved to still have the problem that the contrast in a toe
portion and/or the color tone in a highlight portion are
