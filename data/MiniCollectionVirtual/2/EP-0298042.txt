<ABSTRACT>
The chimney cowl is provided with a pipe connection piece (1) which delimits the flue gas passage opening (0) and which is surrounded by a casing (2) which is arranged coaxially to said piece, projects above it and is open at the top and bottom. The pipe connection piece (1) is, in a simple manner and for the entire life of the other parts of the chimney cowl, to be provided in its region situated above the chimney outlet opening with a weather- resistant, non-deteriorating heat insulation, in order to avoid any condensate formation inside this pipe region. To this end, the pipe connection piece (1) is, on its part (a) situated above the chimney head, surrounded by a tubular screen part (5) arranged concentrically to it, to form an air insulation gap (4). The screen part is fixed in its position in relation to the pipe connection piece (1), avoiding formation of a cold bridge between the screen part (5) and the pipe connection piece (1), via heat-insulating fastening means (7, 7').

1. Chimney cowl having at least one pipe connection piece (1) 
delimiting the flue gas throughflow opening, and having an outer 

casing (2) open at the bottom and at the top, arranged coaxially 
with respect to the pipe connection piece, projecting over it and 

surrounding it, characterized in that the pipe connection piece 
(1), on its part (a) intended to project out of the chimney, is 

surrounded by a tubular cover part (5) arranged coaxially with 
respect thereto to form an air insulation gap (4) surrounding 

said pipe connection piece, which cover part to avoid cold 
bridging between the cover part (5) and the pipe connection piece 

(1) is connected by way of heat-insulating securing means (7) to 
a support flange (3) connected to the pipe connection piece (1) 

and is thus fixed in its position with respect to the pipe 
connection piece (1). 
2. Chimney cowl having at least one pipe connection piece (1) 
delimiting the flue gas throughflow opening, and having an outer 

casing open at the bottom and at the top, arranged coaxially with 
respect to the pipe connection piece, projecting over it and 

surrounding it, characterized in that the pipe connection piece 
(1), on its part (a) intended to project out of the chimney, is 

surrounded by a tubular cover part (5) arranged coaxially with 
respect thereto to form an air insulation gap (4) surrounding 

said pipe connection piece, which cover part to avoid cold 
bridging between the cover part (5) and the pipe connection piece 

(1) is connected at its upper end by way of heat-insulating 
securing means (7â€²) to the pipe connection piece (1) and is thus 

fixed in its position with respect to the pipe connection piece 
(1), and is provided at its lower end with beads to support it 

on a chimney. 
3. Chimney cowl according to Claim 1, characterized in that the 
cover part (5) extends as far as directly above a support flange 

(3) connected to the pipe connection piece (1) preferably by way 
of a heat-insulating means (12), to form an air gap (11)  

 
permitting a low degree of air circulation between the air 

insulation gap and the external atmosphere. 
4. Chimney cowl according to one of Claims 1 to 3, characterized 
in that the heat-insulating securing means comprises silicone 

caoutchouc. 
5. Chimney cowl according to Claim 1 or 2, characterized in that 
the air insulation gap (4), at its upper and/or lower end, is 

closed off by means of the heat-insulating securing means, 
avoiding cold bridging. 
6. Chimney cowl according to one of Claims 1 to 5, characterized 
in that the cover part (5), widening outwards at least at its 

lower end, is preferably bent round. 
7. Chimney cowl according to one of Claims 1 to 6, characterized 
in that the air insulation gap (4), at its upper, at least 

partially open end, is projected over by the upper, preferably 
bent-round end of the pipe connection piece (1) and/or cover part 

(5) to prevent the penetration of water or snow. 
8. Chimney cowl according to one of Claims 1 and 3 to 7, 
characterized in that the support flange (3) is constructed as 

a chimney cover element or forms a part of such a one, or is 
connected to such a one preferably by way of a heat-insulating 

means. 
9. Chimney cowl according to one of Claims 1 to 8, characterized 
in that the outer casing (2) has at least the approximate shape 

of the outer surface of a preferably octagonal, regular prism or 
of a truncated pyramid. 
10. Chimney cowl according to one of Claims 1 to 9, 
characterized in that it has a preferably at least approximately 

truncated pyramid-shaped inner casing (8), arranged coaxially 
with respect to the outer casing (2), surrounded by the latter 

and projected over thereby. 
11. Chimney cowl according to one of Claims 1 to 10, 
characterized in that the pipe connection piece (1) is provided 

at the bottom over at least part of its length on its outer side 
with a heat-insulating means, which part is intended to extend 

into the chimney.
