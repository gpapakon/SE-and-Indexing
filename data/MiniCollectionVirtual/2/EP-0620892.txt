<ABSTRACT>
A system for cementing well casing (16) in a bore hole (12) utilizes only top (22) and bottom (20) cementing plugs. The well casing (16) has on its lower end an inwardly extending lip (18) to engage a latch (30) on the lower portion of the bottom cementing plug (20). The bottom cementing plug (20) has a through passage (26) that is covered on the top by a diaphragm (32) and on the bottom by another diaphragm (34).

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to an improved method
and system for cementing the casing of an oil well in a
bore hole.Currently, conventional oil wells require that
drilling equipment be used to create a bore hole to a
desired depth. The drilling equipment is removed and
replaced with a casing string that is secured in the bore
hole by cement. Generally, the casing is run down the
bore hole with a closed end, typically with a guide shoe
and a float collar.A simple guide shoe, such as an open-end collar
with a molded nose, is attached at the end of the casing
string. This shoe directs the casing away from ledges in
the bore hole and minimizes caving of the sidewalls of
the bore hole. At a point one to three joints above the
guide shoe is the float collar that prevents fluids from
entering the casing string. This closed end allows the
casing string to be floated down the bore hole, at the
same time increasing pressure on the bore hole walls by
the displacement of mud and fluid from the center of the
bore hole. This pressure can cause a strain on weaker
formations to break down or plant the casing above the
desired depth.If the close-ended casing string has become
planted or mud is needed to be cleared from around the
casing, the casing string is reciprocated or rotated.
This reciprocation may result in a swab-surge effect on
the bore hole walls. If the casing string is hung up on
an obstruction in the bore hole, the casing is either
reciprocated and rotated through the obstruction or the 
casing is pulled out of the bore hole so that drilling
equipment can re-enter to r√©move the obstruction. It is
only after the closed-end casing has reached the desired
depth in the bore hole may the cementing process be
carried out.A commonly-used cementing method for close-ended
casing requires only a top and bottom cementing
plug with a cement slurry interposed. The bottom plug is
pressed into the casing to clear mud and debris from the
inside of the casing string to prevent contamination of
the cement slurry. The top plug forces down the cement
slurry against the bottom plug. When the bottom plug
reaches the float collar, the pressure from the cement
slurry ruptures the upper diaphragm on the top of the
bottom plug and passes through the hollow center and down
through the lower diaphragm out, into and around the
guide shoe and up and around the annular space between
the bore hole and casing. The drawback to this case
cementing method is the requirement that the casing be
close-ended. This close-ended configuration can

A system for cementing casing in a bore
hole (12), the system comprising:


a. a casing string (16) ;
b. a bottom plug (20), having a cylindrical
body with a through passage (28) covered on the top

by a first diaphragm (32) and on the bottom by a second
diaphragm (34), with a coupling device (30) on the bottom

of the body;
c. a top plug (22); and
d. a cement slurry (24) interposed between
the bottom and top plugs, wherein the coupling

device engages with the lower end (18) of the casing
string, and the cement slurry ruptures the diaphragms to

pass through the bottom plug (20) and out a bottom of the
casing and around the end of the casing.
The system as set forth in claim 1,
wherein the casing string has an inwardly-extending lip

(18) on its lower end, and the bottom plug (20) includes
a latch (30) engageable with the lip (18) of the casing

string.
A bottom plug for cementing a casing in a
bore hole, the bottom plug comprising:


a. a cylindrical body having a through
passage (28) ;
b. a first diaphragm (32) covering the
top of the passage (28) of the body;
c. a second diaphragm (34) covering the
bottom of the passage of the body; and,
d. a coupling device (30) on the bottom
of the body for engagement with the lower end of the

casing.
The bottom plug as set forth to claim 3,
wherein the coupling device (30) is a latch.
The bottom plug as set forth in claim 4,
further comprising a check valve (40) in the passage

(28), allowing fluid to pass from the top of the bottom
plug (20) down through said passage but preventing the

fluid from moving from the lower portion of the bottom
plug up and into the top portion of the bottom plug.
The bottom plug as set forth in claim 5,
wherein the cylindrical body has a plurality of wiper

blades (38) on the perimeter to mechanically wipe the
inner wall of the casing.

bore, comprising the steps of:


a. providing a system for cementing
casing in a well bore, said system including a casing

string, a bottom plug (20) having a cylindrical body with
a through passage (28) covered by a top diaphragm (32)

and bottom diaphragm (34), and a coupling device (30);
b. pumping the bottom plug (20) into the
casing to remove mud from the inside wall of the casing;
c. pumping cement slurry (24) down behind
the bottom plug (20) ;
d. pushing a top plug (22) against the
cement slurry (24) ;
e. engaging the coupling device (30) with
the lower end (18) of the casing; and,
f. forcing the cement slurry (24) through
