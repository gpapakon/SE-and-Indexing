<ABSTRACT>
The present invention relates to an electrical apparatus, comprising a housing (1) and at least one printed circuit board (2) which is arranged in the housing (1) and on which there are arranged in a manner set back with respect to the housing (1) light-emitting diodes (LEDs) (7), in particular SMD (surface mounted device) light-emitting diodes (7), it being possible for the light emitted by the light-emitting diodes (7) to be guided, via light guides (light pipes) (9) through recesses (10) arranged in the housing (1), to the outside to a display side (8) of the electrical apparatus. Assembly of the apparatus is simple, secure and can also be fully automated and is thus cost-effective, when the light guides (9) are designed as light guides (9) which can be inserted into the recesses (10) independently of the printed circuit board (2) during assembly of the electrical apparatus and when the light guides (9) and the housing (1) having interacting latching elements (17, 18), with the result that the light guides (9) latch with the housing (1) upon insertion therein.

Electrical apparatus consisting of

a housing (1),

which is composed of a basic housing body
(1') and a housing hood (1"),
and at least one printed-circuit board (2) which
is arranged in the housing (1),


and is held in the housing (1), in particular
in the housing hood (1"), by means of guide

rails (11),
and arranged on which there are light-emitting
diodes (7), in particular SMD light-emitting

diodes (7), which are set back from
the housing (1),
wherein the light emitted by the light-emitting
diodes (7) can be guided outwards to a display

side (8) of the electrical apparatus by way of
light guides (9) through recesses (10), which are

arranged in the housing hood (1"), characterised
in that the light guides (9) can be inserted into
the recesses (10) from a display side (8) of the

housing hood (1"),
in that the light guides (9) and the housing hood
(1") have cooperating locating elements (17, 18)

so that the light guides (9), when inserted into
the housing hood (1"), latch with the housing hood

(1"); and
in that the printed-circuit board (2) can be
inserted into the housing hood (1") towards the

display side (8) of the housing hood (1")
so that the printed-circuit board (2) and the
light guides (9) can be assembled independently of

each other.
Electrical apparatus according to claim 1,
characterised in that the light guides (9) can be

inserted into the recesses (10) by means of a 
substantially linear movement.
Electrical apparatus according to claim 1 or
2, characterised in that the light guides (9) are

bevelled on their insertion side (15).
Electrical apparatus according to one of the
above claims, characterised in that the light-emitting

diodes (7) do not radiate their light directly towards
the display side (8) and in that the light is deflected

towards the display side (8) by means of a directional
surface (12), for example a reflector surface (12),

which is integrated in the light guide (9).
Electrical apparatus according to claim 4,
characterised in that the directional surface (12) is

surrounded by a protective casing (13).
Electrical apparatus according to one of the
above claims, characterised in that a plurality of

light guides (9) are combined to form a one-piece light
guide unit (14).
Electrical apparatus according to claim 6,
characterised in that the locating elements (18) on the

light guide side are arranged at the ends of the light
guide unit (14).
