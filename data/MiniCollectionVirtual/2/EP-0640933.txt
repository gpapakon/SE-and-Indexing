<ABSTRACT>
In the case of known fingerprint pickup devices, the start of the image exposure is realised by means of complicated software solutions. Also, deception by means of published fingerprint photographs is not prevented. In the fingerprint pickup device presented, the start of the exposure is realised by means of monitoring the finger contact pressure. Deception by means of photographs is prevented by means of an alteration in the optical system. An actual identification is carried out via the detection of the dislocation of unique subjective features. The fingerprint pickup device (2) is arranged movably and is held in the quiescent position by an elastic element (10). The pressure sensor (11) coupled to the elastic element (10) generates the exposure start signal. Deception by means of photographs is prevented by means of a more marked tilting of the prism (7). The fingerprint pickup device is used in high security regions, in order to permit only authorised persons access to rooms and the use of special devices.
