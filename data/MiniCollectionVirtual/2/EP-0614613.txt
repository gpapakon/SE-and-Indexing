<ABSTRACT>
Raw cacao beans are heated in hot water or water vapor 
containing an acidic, alkaline or alcoholic substance without 

being subjected to fermentation or after being slightly 
fermented, whereby enzymes contained in the beans are 

inactivated, or microorganisms present on the beans are 
destroyed, nibs of the beans being thereby prevented from 

undergoing a color change. 
This method enables production of white cacao nibs, and it 
is thus possible to prepare white chocolates and other 

varieties of food having good flavor and taste by using such 
cacao nibs.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method of producing white
cacao nibs
which have
novel color tone and flavor.Generally, nibs of cacao beans contain a natural pigment
known as anthocyan. This causes cacao nibs to go through color
changes: purple just after harvest, to brownish purple after
they are subjected to fermentation, and further to brown when
they are dried.Certain kinds of cacao beans are colorless (practically
white) because no anthocyan is present in cacao nibs thereof.
However, cacao nibs of such a colorless kind are still subject
to a color change, to brown when they are fermented, and after
having been dried, the nibs as a whole further change in color
to bright brown. When dried without being passed through the
process of fermentation, they are still subject to a color
change, to brown. As such, dried cacao nibs which are white in
color have never been produced in the past.There is a kind of chocolate, white in color, which is
generally known as white chocolate. This chocolate is made
essentially of a vegetable fat (yellowish white in color) 
contained in cacao nibs without using cacao nibs as such.Therefore, white chocolate lacks characteristic astringency
and bitterness of a real chocolate, and is found
unsatisfactory in many respects from the standpoint of
flavor.As such, in some countries such kind of chocolate is
prohibited from being called a chocolate.US 2,558,854 discloses a method to cure raw cacao by a
selective enzymic treatment and substantially without
fermentation by maintaining the white raw cacao beans at a
temperature between 50°C and 65°C with a moisture content
not less than 12 % to 15 % for a period between 5 to 50
hours. The cured cacao beans are substantially free from
natural astringency. They have a light brown color, but are
free of off-colors.It is, therefore, an object of the present invention to
provide a method of producing white cacao nibs, which
provides varieties of food having good flavor and taste,
including white chocolates, produced by using such white
cacao nibs.This object is attained by the method of claim 1. Claims 2
to 6 describe preferred embodiments of the method of claim
1. In the present invention, the term "after harvest" refers to
the state of cacao beans, as removed from pods and still
enclosed in a pulp, such that they have not yet gone through
fermentation. Cacao beans in such a state are called raw beans,
and when the raw beans are finally dried, they are called
dried beans irrespective of whatever treatment they may have
passed
</DESCRIPTION>
<CLAIMS>
A method of producing white cacao nibs characterized in that cacao beans
of the colorless type, after harvest thereof and after allowing to stand or

being agitated in a temperature atmosphere of about 30°C for a time period of
less than two days to slightly ferment, are preheated for a time period of 30

seconds to 1 hour by immersing the beans in hot water, steaming them with
water vapor or heating them under pressure in a water vapor atmosphere, at

temperature of 60°C to 120°C and are then dried.
The method of claim 1 characterized in the cacao beans are preheated in
an alcoholic atmosphere.
The method of claim 1 characterized in that the cacao beans are preheated
in alkaline hot water.
The method of claim 1 characterized in that the cacao beans are preheated
in alkaline hot water containing alcohol.
A method of producing white cacao nibs characterized in that cacao
nibs obtained to the method defined in any of claims 1 to 4 are further dried

or roasted at a temperature of not more than 130°C. 
A method of producing white cacao nibs characterized in that cacao nibs
obtained according to the method defined in any of claims 1 to 4 are roasted by

hot air drying or direct heating.
