<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a low activity localised aluminide coating for a
metallic article made by positioning a coating material, preferably in the form of a

tape, on a portion of the article. The coating material comprises a binder, a halide
activator, an aluminum source, and an inert ceramic material. The coating material

and the article are heated in an inert atmosphere between about 1800°F (982°C) and
about 2050°F (1121°C) for between about four and about seven hours thereby

producing a low activity localized aluminide coating having an outward diffusion
aluminide coating microstructure characterized by two distinct zones, an inner

diffusion zone and an outer zone including between about 20-28 percent, by weight,
aluminum.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates generally to aluminide coatings and particularly to
aluminide coatings which are resistant to oxidation degradation and thermal fatigue
cracking.Aluminide coatings are known to provide oxidation and corrosion protection
for superalloy articles, such as blades and vanes, used in gas turbine engines. Such
coatings are favored in the gas turbine engine industry because they are economical
and add little weight to the engine.Aluminide coatings may be formed by a pack process wherein a powder
mixture, including an inert material, a source of aluminum, and a halide activator is
employed. The superalloy to be coated is inserted into a coating box and covered with
the powder mixture or pack. The coating box is then placed in a retort. A reducing or
inert gas is then flowed through the retort. During the coating process, the halide
activator reacts with the source of aluminum and produces an aluminum-halide vapor
which circulates over the surface of the superalloy article. Upon contact with the
surface of the superalloy article, the vapor decomposes and deposits aluminum on the
superalloy surface whereby the halide is released and contacts the aluminum source to
continue the chemical reaction. The deposited aluminum then combines with nickel
from the superalloy surface thereby forming an aluminum-rich surface layer or 
coating on the superalloy article. Use of this pack process is advantageous when it is
desired to coat the entire surface of a superalloy article. However, it is difficult to
coat select portions of the article without the employment of detailed masking
techniques.Another known technique for forming an aluminum-rich surface layer on a
superalloy article is a vapor phase aluminiding process. Generally, in this process the
superalloy article is suspended in an out-of-contact relationship with the above
described powder mixture as opposed to being embedded within the powder mixture.
However, problems are associated with some vapor phase aluminiding processes.
For example, formation of undesirable oxides within the coating itself and on the
original substrate surface may be encountered. These oxides are undesirable because
they may degrade the coating properties.U.S. Patent No. 3,102,044 to Joseph describes another method of forming an
aluminum-rich surface layer on a superalloy article. In this method an aluminum-rich
slurry is applied to the superalloy surface and heat treated to form a protective
aluminide coating thereon. Although such aluminum-rich slurry techniques can be

A method of producing a low activity localized aluminide coating on a nickel
base metallic article, the method comprising the steps of:


a. positioning a coating material which is in the form of a tape on a portion
of the article, said coating material comprising a binder, a halide activator, an

aluminum source excluding elemental aluminium and aluminium silicon and an inert
ceramic material; then
b. positioning a nickel or stainless steel foil material over the coating
material to hold the coating material in place so that the tape is not dislodged prior to

completion of the subsequent heat treatment process; and then
c. heating the coating material, foil material and the article in an inert
atmosphere between 1800°F (982°C) and 2050°F (1121°C) for between four and

seven hours, the temperature and aluminium activity being such as to produce a low
activity localized aluminide coating having an outward diffusion aluminide coating

microstructure 
characterized by
 two distinct zones, an inner diffusion zone and an outer
zone consisting substantially of NiAl including between 20-28 percent, by weight,

aluminum.
