 VEHICLE OCCUPANT RESTRAINT BELT BUCKLE INCLUDING ILLUMINATIONTECHNICAL FIELDThis invention relates to a buckle for use with a vehicle occupant restraint belt system including at least one belt portion for restraining a vehicle occupant upon detachable securement of a keeper of the belt system by the buckle so as to secure the belt portion across the occupant.BACKGROUND ARTVehicle occupant restraint belt systems conventionally include at least one belt portion and a buckle for detachably securing a keeper of the belt system to secure the belt portion across the occupant so as to restrain the occupant from movement. The buckle normally includes a hollow housing in which a latch member is received for movement between latched and unlatched positions to detachably secure the keeper. Currently manufactured restraint belt systems for the most part have the keeper constructed with a D-shape and are thus referred to as a D-ring. The latch member is received within the opening of the D-shaped keeper to secure the keeper to the buckle in a latched position and is moveable from the latched positioned to an unlatched position to release the keeper from the buckle and thereby free the occupant from the restraint belt system. Conventional vehicle occupant restraint systems of this type are disclosed by United States Patents 4,052,775 Gavagan et al and 4,064,603 Romanzi, Jr.In order to ensure that the vehicle occupant restraint belt system is utilized, prior systems have incorporated indicators such as disclosed by United 

 States Patent 3,588,811 Prickett to provide a light indication at the instrument panel of the securement of the keeper by the buckle. Likewise, as disclosed by United States Patents 3,806,867 Quantz and 3,934,671 Hart, vehicles have also utilized ignition interlocks, with or without a warning device, to prevent vehicle operation when the restraint belt system is not in place with the keeper secured by the buckle.Prior vehicle restraint belt systems such as disclosed by United States Patent 4,365,285 Brundidge have also included an illuminated clip which attaches to one end of the belt and is illuminated by a fiber optic cord from a remote light source when the buckle and the keeper are in a detached relationship from each other. Upon securement of the keeper by the buckle, a switch is open circuited such that the remote light source is extinguished and the illumination by the clip is likewise extinguished. Provision of this illumination clip and the associated fiber optic cord for lighting the

HAT IS CLAIMED IS:
1. For use in a vehicle occupant restraint belt system including at least one belt portion for restraining a vehicle occupant, a buckle for detachably securing a keeper of the belt system to secure the belt portion across the occupant, said buckle comprising: a hollow housing including a translucent portion; a latch member mounted within the housing for movement between latched and unlatched positions to detachably secure the keeper; an electrically energized light source mounted within the housing to provide illumination through the translucent portion; and electrical connectors within the housing for connecting the light source to a power supply so as to thereby energize the light source and provide illumination through the translucent portion.
2. A vehicle occupant restraint belt buckle as in claim 1 wherein the translucent portion of the housing comprises a plastic button that operates the latch member.
3. A vehicle occupant restraint belt buckle as in claim 1 further including a button that operates the latch member and wherein the translucent portion of the housing is spaced from the button.
4. A vehicle occupant restraint belt buckle as in claim 3 wherein the translucent portion is embodied by an extremity of the light source. 


 5. A vehicle occupant restraint belt buckle as in claim 3 wherein the translucent portion is a separate component from the light source and wherein the light source is located adjacent the translucent portion.
6. A vehicle occupant restrain belt buckle as in claim 1 further including a switch that controls energization of the light source in response to the secured or detached condition of the keeper by the latch member.
7. A vehicle occupant restraint belt buckle as in claim 1 which includes two light sources mounted within the housing, one of the light sources emitting light of one color and the other light source emitting light of another color, and switch means for energizing only the one light source when the keeper is detached from the buckle and for energizing only the other light source when the keeper is attached to the buckle by the latch member.
8. A vehicle occupant restraint belt buckle as in claim 7 wherein the one light source emits red light when the keeper is detached from the buckle and wherein the other light source emits green light when the keeper is attached to the buckle by the latch member.
9. A vehicle occupant restraint belt buckle sa in claim 7 wherein the two light sources are selected from the group consisting of:
(a) a pair of bulbs one of which emits light of the one color and the other of which emits light of the other color; and (b) a pair of light emitting diodes one of which emits light of the one color and the other of which emits light of the other color. 


 10. A vehicle occupant restraint belt buckle as in claim 1 which includes a single light source mounted within the housing, and further including switch means for energizing the single light source in response to the secured or detached condition of the keeper by the latch member.
11. A vehicle occupant restraint belt buckle as in claim 10 wherein the single light source is selected from the group consisting of: (a) a bulb;
(b) a light emitting diode for emitting light of a single color; and
(c) a bipolar light emitting diode for selectively and alternately emitting light of two different colors.
