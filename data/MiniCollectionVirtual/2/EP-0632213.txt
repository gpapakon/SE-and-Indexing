<ABSTRACT>
The reduction gear box comprises a housing (2), an input 
shaft (3) having its longitudinal axis (A) horizontal and 

coupled to a drive shaft, an output shaft (4) having its 
longitudinal axis (B) horizontal and coupled to a 

utiliser shaft, and several drive reduction stages within 
the housing between the input shaft and the output shaft. 

One stage (21) after the first stage includes a gear pair 
constituted by a hypoid bevel pinion and a bevel crown 

gear (26) with mutually perpendicular axes, the axis (C) 
of the pinion being offset from the axis (B) of the crown 

gear by a distance (X) such that the axes (A and B) of 
the input shaft and of the output shaft intersect at 

right angles and lie in the same horizontal plane.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a multi-stage angle 
drive reduction gear box. It is known that reduction gear boxes of the type 
mentioned above include a reduction gear housing, a 
motor-driven input shaft, an output shaft with its axis 
perpendicular to that of the input shaft, and several 
drive reduction stages between the said shafts, which 
stages are installed in the housing. A reduction gear 
box with the features of the preamble of claim 1 is known 
from NL-A-8 001 384. One of the main disadvantages of the reduction gear boxes 
described above lies in the fact that longitudinal axes 
of the input and output shafts lie in different planes 
whereby the axis of the engine drive shaft coupled to the 
input shaft is at a higher (lower) level than the 
utiliser shaft coupled to the output shaft. All this 
constitutes a limitation on the use of such gear boxes. 
In fact, when it is wished to transmit drive to the 
utiliser shaft in the reverse sense from previously it is 
necessary to use a second reduction gear box which is 
arranged internally so as to cause the output shaft to 
rotate in the reverse sense. It is for this reason that 
the attachment means for fixing the reduction gear 
housing to a fixed frame are formed in a single, 
predetermined horizontal wall of the housing itself.  
 The object of the present invention is to provide a 
multi-stage angle drive reduction gear box in which the 
longitudinal axes of the input and output shafts lie in 
the same horizontal planes. Further objects and advantages of the present invention 
will become apparent during the course of the description 
which follows. On the basis of the present invention, a multi-stage 
angle drive reduction gear box is formed of the type 
comprising: 
a reduction gear housing; an input shaft with its longitudinal axis horizontal 
coupled to a drive shaft of an engine;  an output shaft with its longitudinal axis horizontal 
coupled to a utiliser shaft; and  a plurality of drive reduction stages defined within the 
housing between the input shaft and the output shaft;   
characterised in that one of the reduction stages after 
the first stage includes a gear pair constituted by a 
hypoid bevel pinion and a bevel crown gear with mutually 
perpendicular axes, the axis of the pinion and the axis 
of crown gear being offset from each other, the offset 
being such that the axes of the input shaft and the 
output shaft intersect at right angles and lie in the 
same horizontal plane.  
 For a better understanding of the present
