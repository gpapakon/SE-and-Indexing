<ABSTRACT>
A method of accurately resuming laser beam machining without leaving any portions unprocessed when 
processing is interrupted during laser beam machining. When laser beam machining has progressed a distance L₀ from 

a processing point P1 and abnormal processing is detected at a processing point P3, a computerized numerical control 
receives the detection signal of abnormal processing to go into retry processing. Namely, laser beam machining is 

first suspended and the position of the processing point P3 at the time of suspension is stored. Then a processing 
head is retracted a distance h₀ in a Z axis direction and is reversed a distance L₂ along a processing path L along 

which processing has been executed theretofore. When reversing is completed at a point P6, a gap between the nozzle 
and the work piece is controlled, and laser beam machining is resumed when approaching has completed. When the 

computerized numerical control again receives a detection signal of abnormal processing during forward movement 
of the processing head from a processing point P7 to a processing point P4, the above retry processing is again 

performed. When the number of such repetitions exceeds a predetermined number of times n₀, for example, three 
times, processing of the block being processed is skipped, and processing proceeds to the subsequent block.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a laser machining
resuming method of resuming laser machining which is interrupted
while it is being carried out.A laser machining resuming method of resuming laser
machining which is interrupted due to burning and the like
while it is being carried out is one of the most important
problems for automatically carrying out laser machining.
As the laser machining resuming method, there is conventionally
known a method by which, when laser machining is
interrupted due to the occurrence of abnormal machining
and the like, a machining head is once retracted in a Z-axis
direction and machining is carried out again at the
position where the laser machining is interrupted to resume
the laser machining.Nevertheless, even if machining is stopped by detecting
abnormal machining and the like, a problem arises
in that since a machine cannot stop at once, there remains
an unmachined portion before the machining head completely
stops. In the above prior art, machining is resumed from
the aforesaid state. Therefore, laser machining cannot be 
resumed well or even if it can be resumed, the unmachined
portion is left because the cause of the abnormal machining
remains as it is.Taking the above into consideration, the object of
the present invention is to provide a laser machining
resuming method capable of securely resuming laser machining
without leaving an unmachined portion.To solve the above problem, according to the present
invention, there is provided a laser machining resuming
method of resuming laser machining when the laser machining
is interrupted while it is being carried out, comprising
the steps of interrupting the laser machining when abnormal
machining is sensed while the laser machining is being
carried out, storing a position where the laser machining
is carried out when the abnormal machining is sensed as
well as retracting a machining head a predetermined distance,
moving the machining head backward a predetermined
distance along a machining path along which the laser
machining has been executed until the occurrence of interruption
of the laser machining on the completion of the
retraction, causing the machining head to approach a workpiece
on the completion of the backward movement, resuming
the laser machining on the completion of the approach and
moving forward the machining head along the machining path
along which the laser machining has been executed until the 
occurrence of interruption of the laser machining, determining
whether the machining head has passed
