<ABSTRACT>
A variable inductance element comprising an inductor conductor 
10 having a predetermined shape formed on an insulation layer 

40 on the surface of a semiconductor substrate 42, switches 16 
and 24 for shorting portions of the inductor conductor 10, and 

input/output terminals 12 and 14 provided at the respective 
ends of the inductor conductor 10. When switches 16 and/or 24 

is in the on state, the function as an inductor having a 
smaller inductance than the overall inductor conductor 10 is 

obtained. The inductance of this variable inductance element 
can be changed by external control, while manufacturing is 

easy and formation in a unitized manner with an integrated 
circuit or other semiconductor device is enabled.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a variable inductance element
having a predetermined inductance and being used as either part of
a semiconductor or other device, or as a discrete element.The rapid advancement of electronics technology in recent
years has brought about the broad use of electronic circuits
in a wide range of fields. In particular, progress in
semiconductor manufacturing technology is continuing to make
high integration LSI and other devices commonplace.These type of integrated circuits comprise large numbers
of semiconductor components, including MOS transistors,
bipolar transistors, diodes and others. Other components,
such as capacitors utilizing pn junctions and resistors with
characteristics determined by the density of minority carrier
in the semiconductor are also incorporated into the devices.
Consequently, large scale integrated circuits (LSI) are
constructed with nearly all of the individual components
contained internally.However, in the case of conventional integrated circuits,
although nearly all the circuit elements could be included
internally, coils had to be provided externally to the device.
Also, since the inductance of a coil is determined by the coil
shape, suitably changing the inductance according to requirements 
after fabrication was impossible. For example, a known
means of variably setting the inductance is to insert a
magnetic core. However, in order to change the inductance,
the position of this magnetic core needs to be shifted.
Therefore, manufacturing of such an inductor is complex, and
use as a portion of an integrated circuit is impossible.DE-A-39 41 323 discloses a semiconductor device having an integrated inductance
element. This inductance element is formed of a plurality of portions which are connected
to one or more transistor switches. By actuating the transistor switches, the total impedance
of the inductance element can be changed.The present invention considers the above mentioned points and
one of its objects is to provide a variable inductance
element that is easy to manufacture and wherein the inductance
can be changed by external control.Another object of this invention is to provide a variable
inductance element that can be formed in an integrated manner
with a semiconductor device such as an integrated circuit.In order to resolve the above mentioned problems, a
variable inductance element according to the present invention
comprises the features mentioned in claim 1.The variable inductance element comprises one or a
plurality of inductor
