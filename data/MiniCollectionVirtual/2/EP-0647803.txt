<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a plug-in coupling (1) for pressure fluid systems, especially air-brake systems. It comprises a housing part (2) and a plug part (4) which can be inserted in a sealing manner in a plug-in opening in the housing part (2). An outer seal is provided against the penetration of dirt, moisture etc. The outer seal is designed as a cap-like sealing element (26) with an inner ring part (28) which can be connected at the circumference in an essentially leaktight manner to the plug part (4), with an outer ring part (30) which can be connected at the circumference in an essentially leaktight manner to the housing part (2), and with a flexible sleeve-like central part (32) which connects the two ring parts (28, 30) to one another.

Plug-in coupling (1) for pressure systems, in particular for
compressed-air braking systems, comprising a housing part (2) and

a plug part (4) which can be sealingly plugged into a plug-in
opening (8) of the housing part (2), with provision for external

sealing against penetration of dirt, moisture and the like,
characterised in that the external sealing takes the form of a

cap-like sealing element (26) having an inner annular part (28)
connectable circumferentially in substantially sealed fashion to

the plug part (4), an outer annular part (30) connectable
circumferentially in substantially sealed fashion to the housing

part (2), and an envelope-like flexible middle part (32)
interconnecting the two annular parts (28, 30), in that the inner

annular part (28) of the sealing element (26) is connectable to
the plug part (4) by way of a snap-in, circumferentially closed

positive-locking or frictional-locking connection, in that the
envelope-like middle part (32) of the sealing element (26) is

constructed with a flexibility and elasticity such that the inner
and the outer annular part (28, 30) are movable in the axial

direction and also in the radial direction relative to one
another, it being possible for the inner annular part (28) to be

resiliently widened by way of a portion (40) of the plugged-in
plug part (4) during the plugging-in procedure and to latch into

an outer annular groove (42) of the plug part (4) axially
adjoining the portion (40).
Plug-in coupling according to Claim 1, characterised in that
the outer annular part (30) of the sealing element (26) is

connected to the housing part (2) by way of a snap-in,
circumferentially closed positive-locking or frictional-locking

connection.
Plug-in coupling according to Claim 1 or 2, characterised
in that the outer annular part (30) of the sealing element (26) 

extends over an axial retaining portion (34) of the housing part
(2) and engages, by an inner, circumferentially continuous

latching web (36), in an outer annular groove (38) of the housing
part (2).
Plug-in coupling according to one or more of Claims 1 to 3,
characterised in that the middle part (32) of the sealing element

(26) is constructed in the manner of a bellows.
Plug-in coupling according to one or more of Claims 1 to 4,
characterised in that the sealing element (26) having the two

annular parts (28, 30) and the middle part (32) is constructed
as a one-piece moulding, in particular of plastics.
Plug-in coupling according to one or more of Claims 1 to 5,
characterised in that the plug part (4) can be locked in the

plug-in opening (8) of the housing part (2) by way of a slotted,
radially resilient retaining ring (10).
Plug-in coupling according to Claim 6, characterised in that
the housing part (2) comprises a joining body (16) and a screw-in

body (18) capable of being screwed into the latter, an annular-groove-shaped
receiving chamber (14) for the retaining ring (10)

being formed between the joining body (16) and the screw-in body
(18).
Plug-in coupling according to one or more of Claims 1 to 7,
characterised by a spring element (24) arranged between the

housing part (2) and the plug part (4) and acting upon the plug
part (4), in its locked state, in the release direction with an

axially directed spring force, the plug part (4) being movable,
in its locked state, over a certain distance in the axial

direction.
Plug-in coupling according to one or more of Claims 6 to 8,
characterised in that an outer annular groove (12), cooperating

in locking fashion with the retaining ring (10), of the plug part 
(4) on the one hand and the outer annular groove (42),

cooperating with the inner annular part (28) of the sealing
element (26), of the plug part (4) on the other hand are arranged

and constructed in such a way that, on plugging in the plug part
(4), first of all the holding ring (10) latches into the

corresponding outer annular groove (12), then the plug part (4)
can be pushed in further axially until the inner annular part

(28) latches into the outer annular groove (42) assigned to it,
and finally the plug part (4) - owing to the action of the spring

element (24) - is moved axially back into its locking position
in the release direction, taking the inner annular part (28) with

it and flexibly deforming the middle part (32).
