<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to an apparatus for exchanging a casting tube on a metallurgical vessel, in which the refractory casting tube, having a head plate and a moving base plate, can be placed on slide rails which are arranged on the bottom of the casting vessel and are spring-loaded at least in parts, and can be displaced by means of a drive unit into a casting position, in which the head plate of the casting tube and the base plate rest in a sealed manner in the region of the pouring opening of the vessel, and in which the spent casting tube can be transferred together with the head plate and the base plate into a removal position. According to the invention, it is possible to regulate the maximum metal flow through the pouring opening of the vessel, preferably down to zero, by displacing the casting tube or the base plate.
