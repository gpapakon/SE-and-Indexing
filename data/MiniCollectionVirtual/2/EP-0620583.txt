<ABSTRACT>
A magnetron sputter apparatus is disclosed which includes a 
rotatable generally heart-shaped, closed-loop magnet array (10) behind 

the 
target (20) and in front of a pair of separately driven stationary 

electromagnets (35,36). The apparatus is optimized to produce a sputtered 
film on a planar substrate having desired film characteristics such as 

uniformity of thickness, good step coverage, and good via filling and 
efficient utilization of the target. The shape of the generally 

heart-shaped 
array includes a flattened tip forming an arc of a circle 

centered on the axis of rotation and concave cusps in the lobes of the 
heart-shape. The electromagnets are used to increase target utilization 

at its center and to compensate for the change in shape of the target 
and distance from the target to the substrate with depletion.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention pertains to a method and apparatus for making 
fine adjustment in the magnetic field of a magnetron sputtering 
apparatus, and in particular to fine adjustments to the field produced 
by a rotatable magnet array and more particularly to fine adjustments 
in the localized sputtering intensity of the plasma supported therein. Physical vapor deposition by sputtering is a well known process 
that has widespread application in the fabrication of integrated circuit 
semiconductor devices. In semiconductor device fabrication, a large 
number of integrated circuit devices are normally formed on a thin, 
generally circular semiconductor substrate known as a wafer. 
Integrated circuit device fabrication involves a large number of 
processing steps, with sputtering typically being used to provide metal 
layers which serve as interconnects between devices and device layers. 
Most commonly, sputtered aluminum is the material used for these 
purposes. Modern semiconductor processing has also seen the 
increased use of sputtered tungsten, tungsten silicide, titanium, 
titanium nitride and other films. Sputter coating is carried out in a vacuum chamber filled with 
an inert gas in which a target of sputterable material is subjected to an 
electric potential with respect to the chamber anode. Electrons which 
are excited in the vicinity of the target strike and ionize the gas ions 
and the positive ions strike the target causing target atoms to be 
ejected. A magnetron sputtering source is capable of high rate 
sputtering and represents an enormous improvement over devices  
 
forming thin films based on diode sputtering or evaporative techniques. 
In magnetron sputtering a plasma is formed in a low pressure inert gas 
by the application of a suitable DC or RF electric field. The plasma 
is confined by a magnetic field to a region near a target which is made 
of the material to be sputtered and which usually serves as the cathode 
of the system. The magnetic field, typically having field lines which 
loop through the sputter target surface, restricts the trajectories of the 
electrons of the plasma to retard their transport to the anode and 
confine them in a region so that ions in the plasma bombard the 
sputter target dislodging atoms of the target material which then 
become deposited on a substrate, i.e. a semiconductor wafer. The demand for lower cost circuits implies larger wafer sizes 
which imposes greater demands on sputtering systems. For example, 
one requirement of a sputtering system used in
