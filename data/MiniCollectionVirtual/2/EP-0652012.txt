<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to materials and methods for passing, and transporting 
other substances, through the blood-brain barrier. If one accepts the premise that most physiological functions are controlled by 
the brain and the medium of that control is electrical signalling as an incident to 
chemical activity in the brain, then it seems logical to conclude that an absence in the 
brain of the chemicals required for that activity can result in signal failure and 
consequent physiological disfunction. It is possible also to conclude that a genetic trait 
which interferes with such chemical activity can result in signal failure and disfunction. 
It is also possible to conclude that the presence of a given substance in the brain may 
interfere chemically with the proper generation of control signals. Such considerations, the search for an understanding of the mechanism of drug 
dependence, drunkenness, Alzheimer's disease, schizophrenia and other disorders, some 
associated with the brain and others apparently not, have lead many researchers to look 
for a relation between such disorders and availability of chemicals in the brain. The 
medical literature includes descriptions that comparison of brain tissue of persons who 
succumbed to a given disease with that of persons who died of unrelated causes suggest 
a relation between a given chemical and the disease. Thus lack of lithium has been 
mentioned in connection with schizophrenia and lack of neuropeptides has been 
mentioned in connection with Alzheimer's disease.  Studies in that area, the chemical treatment of brain cancers, and other studies 
and procedures are hampered by the difficulty in introducing chemicals into the brain 
because of what is commonly called the blood-brain barrier. The blood vessels of the 
brain are formed by cells which are more closely packed than are the vessels elsewhere 
in the body. That fact and the action of the astrocyte cells account for the fact that 
many materials are difficult to introduce into the glia of the brain. In some cases the 
only way that researchers had of getting those materials was to form a hole in the 
subject's skull and inject the desired material into the brain. This invention relates to the transportation of material through that blood-brain 
barrier.  It is an object of the invention to provide novel substances and methods which 
are useful in conducting research with animal and human subjects into the causes and 
cure of certain disorders and for the treatment of those disorders. A related
