<ABSTRACT>
Method of wrapping a load and device for carrying out said method. The method of wrapping a load placed on a pallet consists in covering the load with one or more plastic films which obstruct the pallet apertures. The invention is characterized by forming, in the film obstructing the pallet apertures, permanent passages for the forks of handling units. Application especially in wrapping loads transported on standard pallets.

Process for over-wrapping a palletized load 
including a stage of application of one or more plastics 

films around the palletized load which cover the 
palletized load and close the pallet entries, 

characterised by the fact that it includes a stage 
consisting of opening permanent passages (13) for the 

forks (7) of the handling machines in the film closing 
the entries (8) of the pallet (2). 
Process as described in claim 1, characterised by 
the fact that it includes the stages consisting of: 


a) fixing a retaining band (11) around the pallet (2); 
b) joining together the over-wrapping (12) and the 
retaining band (11). 
Process as described in claim 1 or 2, characterised 
by the fact that permanent passages (13) are opened in 

the film closing the entries (8) of the pallet (2) facing 
each other on two opposite sides of the pallet (2). 
Process as described in claim 1, 2, or 3, 
characterised by the fact that opening of the permanent 

passages (13) at the entries (8) of the pallet (2) 
consists of folding the film closing the entries (8) of 

the pallet (2) and of joining together, notably welding, 
the folds obtained. 
Process as described in any one of claims 2 to 4, 
characterised by the fact the over-wrapping (12) is a 

shrinkable cover and that stage b) is effected by heating 
which simultaneously welds the retaining band (11) to the 

cover and shrinks the said cover.  
 
Process as described in any one of the preceding 
claims, characterised by the fact that the pallet (2) 

carrying the load to be over-wrapped is a standard pallet 
having an upper deck and a lower deck which are 

substantially identical connected by blocks substantially 
forming right-angled parallelepipeds. 
Device for over-wrapping palletized loads, 
characterised by the fact that it includes means (19) for 

distribution of a film and formation around the pallet 
(2) of a retaining band (11) which can be joined to an 

over-wrapping (12), notably to a cover, and by the fact 
that it includes means for opening permanent passages 

(13) for the forks (7) of the handling machines in the 
retaining band (11) at at least certain entries (8) of 

the pallet (2). 
Device as described in claim 7, characterised by the 
fact that the means (24) for opening passages (13) for 

the forks (7) of the handling machines at at least 
certain entries (8) of the pallet (2) include thrust 

elements (25) for folding the retaining band (11) and 
means (26) for permanently connecting the folds, notably 

welders. 
Device as described in claim 6, 7, or 8, 
characterised by the fact that it includes means (29) for 

applying an over-wrapping (12), notably a cover, and 
means for joining together the retaining band (11) and 

the over-wrapping (12). 
Device as described in claim 9, characterised by the 
fact that the over-wrapping (12), notably the cover, is 

made of shrinkable plastics film and by the fact that it 
includes heating means to shrink the over-wrapping.  

 
Device as described in any one of claims 7 to 10, 
characterised by the fact that it includes a ring (18) 

which can surround the pallet (2) and by the fact that 
the means (19) for distribution of a thin film suitable 

to constitute the retaining band (11) are mounted to turn 
around the pallet (2) on the ring (18). 
Device as described in any one of claims 7 to 11, 
characterised by the fact that the means (19) for 

distribution of the plastics film suitable to form the 
retaining band (11) include a stretching roller (36) 

smaller in width than the plastics film to stretch the 
central portion of this film.
