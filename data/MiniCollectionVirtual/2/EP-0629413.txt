A blood treatment apparatus comprising: 

a membrane exchanger (2) having a first and a second 
compartments (4, 5) separated by a membrane (3); 
an extracorporeal blood circuit comprising : 

a first tubing (6) connected to an inlet of the first 
compartment (4) and intended to be connected to a patient (1); 
a second tubing (7) connected to an outlet of the first 
compartment (4) and designed to be connected to the patient (1); 
a bypass line (15) linking the first tubing (6) to the second 
tubing (7) in order to define a recirculation loop; 
obturating means (16) to obturate the bypass line (15); 
injection means (10, 11) to inject a liquid in the 
extracorporeal blood circuit; 
withdrawal means (12) to bring about the ultrafiltration of 
plasmatic liquid in the second compartment through the membrane 

(3);
 
   characterized in that: 
the injection means (10, 11) are linked to the recirculation 
loop in order to inject therein a liquid of substitution intended to 

compensate at least partly for the ultrafiltrated liquid
 
   and in that it comprises: 
obturating means (17, 18) to obturate the first tubing (6) and 
the second tubing (7) in order to isolate the patient (1) from the 

recirculation loop; 
pressure measuring means (19) connected to the recirculation 
loop for generating a signal indicative of the difference between a 

flowrate of the infused liquid and a flowrate of the ultrafiltrated 
liquid when the recirculation loop is isolated from the patient (1). 
Device according to claim 1, comprising furthermore means to 
regulate at least one of the injection means (10, 11) and withdrawal 

means (12) from the signal generated by the pressure measuring 
means (19).  

 
Device according to claim 2, characterized in that the 
regulating means comprise a control unit connected to
 the pressure 
measuring means (19), to the injection means (10, 11) and to the 

withdrawal means (12). 
Device according to claims 1 to 3, characterized in that it 
further comprises means to calibrate the injection means (10, 11) 

[respectively to the withdrawal means (12)] in relation to the 

withdrawal means (12) [respectively to the injection means (10, 11)] 

from the signal generated by the pressure measuring means. 
Device according to claim 4, characterized in that the 
calibrating means comprise a control unit connected to the pressure 

measuring means (19), to the injection means (10, 11) and to the 
withdrawal means (12). 
Device according to one of claims 1 to 5, characterized in that 
the injection means comprise a variable flowrate pump (11). 
Device according to one of claims 1 to 6, characterized in that 
the withdrawal means comprise a variable flowrate pump (12). 
Device according to one of claims 1 to 7, characterized in that 
it further comprises a pump (8) for blood circulation located on the 

first tubing (8) inside the recirculation loop. 
Method for controlling liquid injection and withdrawal inside 
and outside an extracorporeal blood circuit connected to a patient (1), 

this method comprising the steps of: 

temporarily isolating a recirculation loop in relation to the 
patient (1), the loop comprising a part of a first tubing (6) linking the 

patient (1) to a membrane exchanger (2), the membrane exchanger (2), 
a part of a second tubing (7) linking the membrane exchanger (2) to 

the patient (1), and a by-pass line (15) connecting the first tubing (6) 
to the second tubing (7); 
circulating blood through the loop; 
measuring the pressure in the loop over a period of time, and, 
when the measured pressure varies over the period of time;  

 
modifying either the injection flowrate of liquid into the loop, 
or the withdrawal flowrate of liquid from the loop in order that the 

pressure is substantially constant, or changes according to a desired 
evolution. 
Method according to claim 9, further comprising the step of 
establishing a correlation between an apparent withdrawal flowrate 

and an apparent injection flowrate. 
Method according to claim 10, characterized in that it applies 
to blood heamofiltration.
