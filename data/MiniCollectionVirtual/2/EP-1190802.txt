<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a high-speed CO2 gas welding
method, and more particularly it relates to a method for
transferring globules at an almost fixed state, without any
accompanying short-circuit, at areas whose voltage is made
higher than that in a buried arc area, humping area, and fusing
area when carrying out high- speed welding whose speed is 5 meters
per minute or more.In a high-speed CO2 gas welding method whose welding speed
exceeds 1.5 meters per minute, no spray transfer is brought
about as in inert gas arc welding even if the welding current
is increased, the size of the globules becomes remarkably large,
wherein short-circuit transfer and globular transfer coexist
to cause the stability of the arc to be impaired, and a great
deal of spatter occurs.Also, an action of electromagnetic pressure resulting from
an electromagnetic force of an arc itself cannot be ignored,
and the influence is reflected by the formation of beads, wherein
the surface of a molten pool is subjected to the action and
is recessed, and a gouging area in which the bottom of the molten 
pool or its peripheries are exposed is formed. In addition,
as the action of the arc pressure is intensified, that is, the
current is increased, the gouging area is widened. Finally,
a problem occurs in that solidification at the peripheral
portions of the molten pool precedes in a state where the gouging
area is not sufficiently filled up due to the exposed portion
thereof, wherein humping beads accompanying undercuts are
brought about.Conventionally, in order to solve such a problem in
high-speed welding, if a buried arc system is employed, in which
the arc length is shortened with the welding voltage being
further lowered than usual, it was considered that there was
an effect of suppressing generation of large-grained spatter,
undercuts and/or humping beads.However, if the above-described buried arc system is
employed in areas in which the welding speed exceeds 1.5 meters
per minute, another problem occurs in that the arc heat source
is buried deep from the surface of a base metal to cause deep
penetration. Further, as shown in Fig. 8, the penetration at
the welding joint is made deep, and the surface portion thereof
is widened to become projection beads, wherein a constricted
portion occurs (to be shaped like a mushroom), and no smooth
bead penetration and surface shape can be obtained as in MAG 
welding. Then, notch toughness of the joint portions is caused
to remarkably deteriorate.It is therefore an object of the invention
