<ABSTRACT>
A novel rotary apparatus wherein a composite rotor which comprising a plurality of ring-like rotors 
arranged concentrically is rotated at a high speed by utilizing magnetic forces. Around a center rotor, 

concentrically arranged are, away from each other, a plurality of annular rotors is rotated around the 
axis of the center rotor. On the surfaces of each rotor opposing the adjacent annular rotors magnets 

are provided. The polarities of the magnets of one rotor are the same as those of another rotor opposing 
the one. The poles of the magnets of two rotors are
 arranged zigzag in the circumferential 
direction.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a rotary 
apparatus capable of rotating a composite rotor at a high 
speed with a magnetic force, which is structured by 
arranging a plurality of ring-shaped rotors concentrically 
with each other. Heretofore, no rotary apparatus is known which 
can rotate a composite rotor at a high speed, which has 
a plurality of ring-shaped rotors arranged concentrically 
with each other. Therefore, the present invention has the object 
to provide such a novel rotary apparatus. In a first aspect of this invention, a rotary 
apparatus is provided, having a 
central rotor centrally arranged so as to be rotatable; 
a plurality of ring-shaped rotors are arranged concentrically 
with said central rotor in a relationship spaced 
apart from each other so as to be rotatable coaxially with 
said central rotor about its rotational axis; a group of 
magnetic poles are disposed on a surface of each rotor on 
the side facing a surface of the adjacent rotor; a group 
of the magnetic poles disposed on the surface of each 
rotor is so arranged as to make each of the magnetic poles 
equal in polarity to another group of the magnetic poles 
disposed on the surface of the adjacent rotor; and each 
magnetic pole of the group of the magnetic poles of each 
rotor is arranged alternately in the rota-tional direction  
 
with each respective magnetic pole of the another group 
of the magnetic pole of the adjacent rotor. For the rotary apparatus in the first aspect of 
this invention, the driving force for rotation applied to 
the central rotor is transmitted to the outer adjacent 
rotor one after another by a magnetic repulsive force 
which is caused to be produced between the rotor and the 
adjacent rotor so as to repel against the displacement of 
the rotor in the circumferential direction of the rotation 
of the rotor. As a result, all the rotors are caused to 
rotate integrally with each other. Once the rotary apparatus starts rotating at a 
high speed, the speed of the rotor on the outer side 
becomes unlikely to vary due to the effect of a flywheel, 
thereby inducing a so-called "return-back" phenomenon, 
i.e. a phenomenon of causing the force of urging the 
rotation transmitted from the side of the central rotor 
to turn at the rotor on the outermost side through the 
rotors on the inner side and eventually back to the 
central rotor. This "return-back" phenomenon greatly 
serves as accelerating the rotational speed of each rotor 
in an extremely efficient way, thereby achieving an 
extremely high
