<ABSTRACT>
A nozzle 24, 34 for joining a pool 18, 28 of water to a nuclear reactor pressure 
vessel 10 includes a tubular body 38 having a proximal end 42 joinable to the pressure 

vessel 10 and a distal end 44 joinable in flow communication with the pool. The body 38 
includes a flow passage 46 therethrough having in serial flow communication a first port 

48 at the distal end 44, a throat 50 spaced axially from the first port 48, a conical channel 
52 extending axially from the throat 50, and a second port 54 at the proximal end 42 which 

is joinable in flow communication with the pressure vessel 10. The inner diameter of the 
flow passage 46 decreases from the first port 48 to the throat 50 and then increases along 

the conical channel 52 to the second port 54. In this way, the conical channel 52 acts as 
a diverging channel or diffuser in the forward flow direction from the first port 48 to the 

second port 54 for recovering pressure due to the flow restriction provided by the throat 
50. In the backflow direction from
 the second port 54 to the first port 48, the conical 
channel 52 is a converging channel and with the abrupt increase in flow area from the 

throat 50 to the first port 48 collectively increase resistance to flow therethrough.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates generally to nuclear reactors, and, more specifically, 
to a nozzle joining a reactor pressure vessel to a water pool. In one type of nuclear reactor being developed, i.e. simplified boiling water reactor 
(SBWR), various pools of water are provided in the containment building surrounding a 
reactor pressure vessel which provide various functions including providing makeup water 
to the pressure vessel in the event of a postulated loss of coolant accident (LOCA). The 
pressure vessel contains a nuclear reactor core which is effective for boiling water therein 
to generate steam under pressure which is conventionally discharged from the pressure 
vessel to provide a source of power to a steam turbine-generator, for example, for 
producing electrical power. In the event of a break in one of the several pipes joined to the 
pressure vessel, water and steam will leak from the pressure vessel which will drop the level 
of water therein available for cooling the reactor core unless suitable provisions are made 
to provide makeup water into the pressure vessel. For example, a conventional boiling water reactor power plant includes a wetwell 
or suppression pool of water in the containment building surrounding the pressure vessel. 
The suppression pool provides various functions during the operation of the power plant 
including, for example, being joined in flow communication to the pressure vessel by a 
suitable conduit extending from the suppression pool to a corresponding inlet nozzle joined 
to the pressure vessel. In the event of a LOCA condition, a suitable valve is opened for 
allowing water to flow by gravity from the suppression pool into the pressure vessel to 
provide makeup water therein. In order to provide additional makeup water during a LOCA condition, the SBWR 
design further includes a gravity driven cooling system (GDCS) which has a corresponding 
GDCS pool of water elevated above the suppression pool which is similarly joined to a 
corresponding inlet nozzle on the pressure vessel for selectively providing makeup water 
thereto upon opening of a suitable valve in the supply pipe therebetween. In both the 
GDCS pool and the suppression pool, it is desirable to have makeup water provided to the 
pressure vessel solely by gravity flow to avoid reliance on power operated pumps which 
could be rendered inoperative in the event of a power failure.  However, since water supply lines must necessarily be provided between the 
pressure vessel and both the GDCS pool and
