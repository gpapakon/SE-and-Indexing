<ABSTRACT>
A process for preparing a polyurethane foam according to the one-shot 
foaming process by reactions between a polyisocyanate and an active hydrogen-containing

having hydroxyl functionality.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a process for producing polyurethane foams using the one-shot foaming process.
The invention specifically relates to using a salt of a tertiary amine and a carboxylic acid with hydroxyl functionality as
defined in claim 1 as a catalyst for promoting reactions involved in the production of one-shot polyurethanes, particularly
flexible polyurethane foams.Polyurethane foams are produced by reacting a polyisocyanate with compounds containing two or more active
hydrogens. The active hydrogen-containing compounds are typically polyols, primary and secondary polyamines, and
water. Two major reactions take place among these reactants during the preparation of a polyurethane foam. These
reactions must proceed simultaneously and at a competitively balanced rate during the process in order to yield a
polyurethane foam with desired physical characteristics.Reaction between the isocyanate and the polyol or polyamine, usually referred to as the gel reaction, leads
to the formation of a polymer of high molecular weight. This reaction is predominant in foams blown exclusively with
low boiling point organic compounds. The progress of this reaction increases the viscosity of the mixture and generally
contributes to crosslink formation with polyfunctional polyols. The second major reaction occurs between the isocyanate
and water. This reaction adds to urethane polymer growth, and is important for producing carbon dioxide gas which
promotes foaming. As a result, this reaction often is referred to as the blow reaction.Both the gel and blow reactions occur in foams blown partially or totally with carbon dioxide gas. In fact, the
in-situ generation of carbon dioxide by the blow reaction plays an essential part in the preparation of "one-shot", water
blown polyurethane foams. Water-blown polyurethane foams, particularly flexible foams, are produced by both molded
and slab foam processes.In order to obtain a good urethane foam structure, the gel and blow reactions must proceed simultaneously
and at optimum balanced rates. For example, if the carbon dioxide evolution is too rapid in comparison with the gel
reaction, the foam tends to collapse. Alternatively, if the gel extension reaction is too rapid in comparison with the blow
reaction generating carbon dioxide, foam rise will be restricted, thus resulting in a high-density foam. Also, poorly
balanced crosslinking reactions will adversely impact foam stability. In practice, the balancing of these two reactions
is controlled by the nature of the
