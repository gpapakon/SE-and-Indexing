<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a process for feeding a sheet (50) into a processing unit, especially a printer with a sheet-feed channel (56, 60). In order to guide the leading edge of even bowed or creased sheets (50c) properly into the feed channel (56, 60), the sheet (50) is advanced towards the feed channel until a flat sheet (50a) projects into it to a certain extent (d) and a creased or bowed sheet (50d) can rest with its front edge against the edge of the channel (54, 56). Subsequent passes by conveying devices (30, 32) fitted on the printing slide (12) force the sheet (50d) behind the channel edge (54, 56).

<CLAIMS>
Process for guiding a document into the transporting 
channel (56, 60) of a document-processing unit, 

in particular a flat-bed printer, having a printing slide 
(12) which 
can be moved along a print line and on which 
a print head (14) and document-directing devices (30, 32) 

are arranged, a printing platen (16), lying opposite the 
print head (14), a supporting table (48) and at least one 

directing baffle (52, 58), arranged parallel to and at a 
distance from the latter and forming with the supporting 

table (48) a transporting channel (56, 60) widening in 
the form of a funnel at the printing platen (16), and 

having a document-transporting device, characterized in 
that a document (50) to be conveyed is transported by its 

leading edge - seen in conveying direction (B) - to such 
an extent in the direction of the transporting channel 

(56, 60) that a flat document (50b) protrudes by a small 
amount (d), preferably 2 mm, into the transporting 

channel (56, 60) and an arched or creased document (50c) 
can be supported by its leading edge against the edge 

(54, 62) of the directing baffle (52, 58), and thereafter 
the printing slide (12) is moved transversely to the 

document-transporting direction in at least one brushing-over 
movement. 
Process according to Claim 1, characterized in 
that, before transport of the document (50) in the 

direction of the transporting channel (56), the printing 
slide (12) performs an additional brushing-over movement. 
Process according to Claim 1 or 2, characterized 
in that the brushing-over movements of the printing slide 

(12) take place up to the end-of-line position.  
 
Process according to one of Claims 1 or 2, the 
document-processing unit being equipped with detecting 

devices (20, 22) for the side edges of the document, 
characterized in that the brushing-over movements of the 

printing slide (12) take place only up to the document 
side edge. 
Process according to one of the preceding claims, 
characterized in that, after a brushing-over movement, 

the print head is moved to approximately the centre of 
the document before the following transporting step.
