<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a twin tool holder for hand-held drilling machines having the following features: two shafts for accommodating one tool each - e.g. drill chuck, screwdriving insert, etc. - are provided; the shafts form an angle with one another which swivels the tool not inserted in each case out of the working area; a device is provided which alternately connects the spindles in a frictional manner to the drive shaft of the drilling machine. The invention is characterised by the following features: the shafts (5.1, 5.2) and the drive shaft of the drilling machine form a plane; the two shafts (5.1, 5.2) are pivotably provided in this plane about an axis perpendicular thereto; a driver (4) connected to the drive shaft in such a way as to be locked against rotation is provided; a bell-shaped piece (1) is provided which is firmly connected to the machine housing; a pivot bearing (2) guided by the bell-shaped piece is provided; the two shafts are mounted in the pivot bearing; at least one link guide (3.1, 3.2) for the pivot bearing (2) is provided which guides the pivoting movement of the pivot bearing so that the shaft (5.1) located in the working position in each case is connected to the driver (4) in such a way as to be locked against rotation; a mechanical lock (9) is provided which prevents unintentional pivoting of the pivot bearing.

Twin tool holder for handheld drilling machines with the following 
features: 


1.1 two shafts (5.1, 5.2) are provided to each accommodate a 
tool, for example a drill chuck, screwdriver, etc.; 
1.2 the shafts (5.1, 5.2) are at an angle which pivots a 
respective not inserted tool out of the operating area; 
1.3 a device is provided which alternately positively connects 
both tool accommodation shafts (5.1, 5.2) to the driveshaft 

of the drilling machine; 
1.4 the shafts (5.1, 5.2) and the driveshaft of the drilling 
machine are positioned in one plane; 
1.5 a pickup (4) is provided which is non-rotationally 
connected to the driveshaft; 
1.6 a dome (1) is provided which is firmly connected to the 
machine housing; 
1.7 a pivotal mount (2) is provided which is guided by the 
dome (1) ; 
1.8 the two shafts (5.1, 5.2) are mounted in the pivotal mount 
(2); 
1.9 at least one link guide (3.1) for the pivotal mount (2) is 
provided which guides the pivotal movement of the pivotal 

mount (2) in such a manner that the respective shaft (5.1, 
5.2) in its operative position is non-rotationally connected 

to the pickup (4); 
1.10 a mechanical locking (9) is provided which prevents 
unwanted pivoting of the pivotal mount (2); 
1.11 both tool accommodation shafts (5.1, 5.2) are pivotal 
around a pivotal axis which is vertical relative to their 

plane;  
 
1.12 the pivotal mount (2) comprises a pivotal pin (13.2) which 
extends coaxially to the pivotal axis; 
1.13 the pivotal pin (13.2) is mounted in a handle (10); 
1.14 on the handle (10) is provided an operating element (11) 
by means of which the detention and release of the 

mechanical locking (9) is operated. 
Tool holder according to Claim 1, 
characterised in that
 for the 
purpose of force transfer from the driveshaft to the shaft (5.1, 

5.2) in its operative position 

2.1 the pickup (4) is designed to be a spur wheel; 
2.2 the shafts (5.1, 5.2) of the tool holder are at their rear end 
provided with a respective spur wheel; and 
2.3 for the purpose of transferring a drive output to the shaft 
(5.1, 5.2), a spur wheel is provided which connects the 

driveshaft to the respective shaft (5.1, 5.2) in its operative 
position. 
Tool holder according to Claim 2, 
characterised in that
3.1 the pickup (4) includes an interior polygon; 
3.2 the pickup (4) comprises for each edge a V-shaped notch 
towards its open side; 
3.3 the shaft (5.1, 5.2) which is to be driven by the pickup (4) 
has on its connecting length to the pickup (4) a respective 

exterior polygon; and 
3.4 each surface of the exterior polygon has at its end which 
leads into the pickup (4) a plane phase-in. 
Tool holder according to one of Claims 1 to 3, 
characterised in 
that
 the link guide (3.1) is designed in such a way that prior to a 
pivotal movement a respective movement in the axial direction 

is performed for coupling and decoupling of shaft (5.1, 5.2) and 
pickup (4).  

 
Tool holder according to one of Claims 1 to 4, 
characterised in 
that
 an additional handle (10) on the pivotal mount (2) is 
provided for pivoting it. 
Tool holder according to Claims 1 to 5, 
characterised in that
 
the mechanical locking mechanism (9, 11) is integrated in the 

handle (10). 
Tool holder according to one of Claims 1 to 6, 
characterised in 
that
 the mounting of at least one shaft (5.1, 5.2) has a play in 
the axial direction, so that the percussion effect of a percussion 

drilling apparatus can be transferred. 
Tool holder according to one of Claims 1 to 7, 
characterised in 
that
8.1 the non-rotational connection between shaft (5.1, 5.2) and 
driveshaft has at least at one shaft (5.1, 5.2) an axial play 

at least at the level of the percussion drill stroke; and 
8.2 the respective shaft (5.1, 5.2) is mounted in the absence of 
axial play.
