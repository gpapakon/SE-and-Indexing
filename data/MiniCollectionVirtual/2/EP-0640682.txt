<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a process for producing an over-based
sulfurized alkaline earth metal phenate.
The phenate produced is useful as a detergent for lubricating oil
or fuel oil or an alkaline detergent, which has a high base
number, is excellent in oil solubility and heat resistance,
and has a bright color, in which a specific amount of fatty
acids or fatty amines is added and a carbon dioxide treatment
is conducted in the presence of a specific amount of water or
lower alcohols.An alkaline earth metal phenate is one of the alkaline
detergents for use in lubricating oils for mainly internal
combustion engines, which functions to neutralize and
disperse acid substances, sludge, etc., generated in engines.
The existence of an alkaline earth metal phenate makes it
possible to prevent engines parts from excessive corroding
caused by acid substances generated in engines and prevent
engine parts from excessive wearing caused by sludge or
lacquer generated engines. Recently, in order to have high
acid-neutralizing ability, over-based
alkaline earth metal phenates have been developed (a phenate which contains an
alkaline earth metal in an amount of more than the 
theoretical amount per an alkylphenol). At present,
sulfurized types have been mainly used to improve heat
resistance and oil solubility. Furthermore, in order to
obtain an alkaline earth metal phenate having higher over-basicity,
in some cases carboxylic acids or alcohols are
added to alkaline earth metal phenates.Insofar as typical conventional methods for
introducing sulfur into phenates are concerned, two methods
are generally known. One of them is a method wherein an
alkylphenol is treated with sulfur chloride to form a sulfide
which is then converted into a metal salt. The other is a
method wherein sulfurization is carried out by using
elemental sulfur during metal addition or after previously
forming a metal salt. The present invention belongs to the
latter sulfurization method. Many past attempts have been
made to produce over-based phenates by using the latter
sulfurization method, for instance, it is reported that over-based
phenates containing alkaline earth metals in an amount
of at least twice the theoretical amount are obtained by one
metal addition reaction.For example, JP-B-60-28878 discloses that highly
basic alkaline earth metal phenates can be unexpectedly
produced by carrying out the above-mentioned reaction in the
presence of an excess of phenols. (The term "JP-B" as used
herein means an "examined Japanese patent
