<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a conveying or cutting drum for agricultural crops, with segment-shaped conveying or cutting elements (2, 3) which can be fastened by means of projections (7) capable of being introduced into slots (4) of a drum casing (1). To achieve a high-strength connection, the conveying or cutting elements (2, 3) are positively connected both to one another and to the drum casing (1). This takes place preferably by making the projections (7) hook-shaped and by designing these hooks (8) so that they are wedged together with the drum casing (1) and, moreover, are positively connected to one another.

<CLAIMS>
A conveyor or cutting drum for agricultural crops comprising a
drum casing in the shape of a circular cylinder and flat, segment-shaped

conveyor or cutting elements which can be connected to the drum casing by
hook-shaped projections which can be introduced into slits in the drum

casing characterised in that the conveyor or cutting elements (2, 3) are
both positively lockingly connected to the drum casing (1) in a radial

direction outwardly and in the peripheral direction and also to each
other in the peripheral direction.
A conveyor or cutting drum according to claim 1 characterised in
that all conveyor or cutting elements (2) except for at least one (3) are

of substantially the same configuration and can be mounted by
introduction of the hook-shaped projections (7) into the slitted (4) drum

casing (1) and subsequent turning in the peripheral direction while at
least one conveyor or cutting element (3) or the like can be inserted

into a gap between two conveyor or cutting elements (2) in such a way
that it bears with an arcuate side against the drum casing (1) and is

force-lockingly or positively lockingly connected with two free ends (9,
10) to the conveyor or cutting elements (2) forming a gap.
A conveyor or cutting drum according to claim 2 characterised in
that the conveyor or cutting elements (3) or the like which can be

inserted in the radial direction are fixedly connected to the conveyor or
cutting elements (2) forming a gap and/or to the drum casing (1) by

welding, screw means or the like.
A conveyor or cutting drum according to claims 1 to 3
characterised in that the operative surfaces (8) of the hook-shaped

projections (7) of the conveyor or cutting elements (1) are of a slightly
conical configuration so that in the rotary movement on the periphery of

the drum casing (1) they become locked thereto.
