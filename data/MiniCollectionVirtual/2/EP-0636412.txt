<ABSTRACT>
Process for the manufacture of supported catalysts including the stages:   - (a) of preparation of a coating suspension containing at least one refractory inorganic oxide and at least some of the elements intended to form the catalytically active phase (A); - (b) of filling at least some of the open porosity of a support with this suspension;   - (c) of draining the filled support by centrifuging; - (d) of heat treatment of the support to obtain a support coated with a porous layer; - (e) optionally of impregnation of the coated support with a solution containing the remainder of the element(s) of the catalytically active phase (A); and   - (f) of thermal activation of the catalyst.   This process of preparation is of particular interest in the manufacture of catalysts for the treatment of exhaust gases of internal combustion engines, in which the porous layer deposited on a support includes especially a refractory inorganic oxide, iron oxide and cerium oxide, and, by way of catalytically active element, at least one noble metal such as platinum, rhodium or palladium.
