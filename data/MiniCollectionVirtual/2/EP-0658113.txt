<DESCRIPTION>
This application is a continuation-in-part of copending
application Serial Number 07/938,334, filed August 31, 1992,
and Serial Number 08/037,230 filed March 26, 1993.This invention relates to immunogenetics and to peptide
chemistry. More particularly, it relates to a nonapeptide
useful in various ways, including as an immunogen and as a
target for the HLA-A1 molecule. More particularly, it relates
to a so-called "tumor rejection antigen", derived from the
tumor rejection antigen precursor encoded by gene MAGE-3, and
presented by human leukocyte antigens of HLA-A1.The study of the recognition or lack of recognition of
cancer cells by a host organism has proceeded in many
different directions. Understanding of the field presumes
some understanding of both basic immunology and oncology.Early research on mouse tumors revealed that these
displayed molecules which led to rejection of tumor cells when
transplanted into syngeneic animals. These molecules are
"recognized" by T-cells in the recipient animal, and provoke
a cytolytic T-cell response with lysis of the transplanted
cells. This evidence was first obtained with tumors induced
in vitro by chemical carcinogens, such as methylcholanthrene.
The antigens expressed by the tumors and which elicited the T-cell
response were found to be different for each tumor. See
Prehn, et al., J. Natl. Canc. Inst. 18: 769-778 (1957); Klein
et al., Cancer Res. 20: 1561-1572 (1960); Gross, Cancer Res.
3: 326-333 (1943), Basombrio, Cancer Res. 30: 2458-2462 (1970)
for general teachings on inducing tumors with chemical
carcinogens and differences in cell surface antigens. This
class of antigens has come to be known as "tumor specific
transplantation antigens" or "TSTAs". Following the
observation of the presentation of such antigens when induced 
by chemical carcinogens, similar results were obtained when
tumors were induced in vitro via ultraviolet radiation. See
Kripke, J. Natl. Canc. Inst. 53: 333-1336 (1974).While T-cell mediated immune responses were observed for
the types of tumor described supra, spontaneous tumors were
thought to be generally non-immunogenic. These were therefore
believed not to present antigens which provoked a response to
the tumor in the tumor carrying subject. See Hewitt, et al.,
Brit. J. Cancer 33: 241-259 (1976).The family of tum- antigen presenting cell lines are
immunogenic variants obtained by mutagenesis of mouse tumor
cells or cell lines, as described by Boon et al., J. Exp. Med.
152: 1184-1193 (1980).To elaborate, tum- antigens are obtained
