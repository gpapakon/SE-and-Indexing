<ABSTRACT>
Disclosed is a cooking apparatus (10) having a housing (12) containing a cooking chamber (14) into which cooking medium is sprayable by spray means (16) to cook food items in the cooking chamber (14). The apparatus (10) stores cooking medium in a buffer tank (18) from which it is circulated by circulation means (20, 42) to the spray means (16). Heating of the cooking medium occurs by operating at least one flow heater (22) located in the circulation means (20, 42) between the buffer tank (18) and the spray means (16). If desired, a plurality of flow heaters (22) can be used and an additional preheater (48) may also be operated to assist in heating the cooking medium at start-up.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a cooking apparatus which is of 
particular advantage for high output processing of food. There is a requirement for cooking apparatus which can cook high 
volumes of food items in a time and energy efficient manner. Therefore, it is 
most important that the cooking medium be used as sparingly as possible to 
reduce heating and other running costs. This problem is particularly acute in the 
case of cooking media such as vegetable oil, animal fat, shortening and the like, 
which also readily oxidise if overheated. This results in wastage of cooking 
medium and poor food quality. Further, oxidation of cooking media is a problem that still requires 
attention by manufacturers of cooking apparatus. The problem primarily arises 
from two sources; firstly, inadequate cooking medium temperature control and, 
secondly, continued usage of cooking apparatus in which the cooking chamber 
is exposed to air. Exemplary of an apparatus having the aforementioned 
disadvantages is British Patent No. 621821 (Crittall) which cooks food by low 
pressure spraying of cooking medium onto food items and provides the heater 
means for the cooking medium in complete isolation to the cooking apparatus. 
Further, the heater means or calorifier is in the form of a heated sump or tank-like 
reservoir. Thus heat loss problems are caused by heat loss from the 
calorifier, which requires high energy inputs to overcome the isolation thereof 
from the cooking apparatus. Moreover, sumps having a high volume have been 
found by the present inventor to require longer residence times for efficient 
heating of the cooking medium. On the other hand, smaller volumes expose the 
cooking medium to overheating, consequential wastage and undesirable 
oxidation. Further, if the cooking medium is a solid fat, serious problems of 
congelation may well be found to occur in the calorifier and the pipes leading 
from the calorifier to the cooking chamber, the more so because the spraying of 
cooking media occurs at low pressure.  
 Any attempt to overcome these problems at the calorifier by high energy 
inputs is likely to result in unacceptable temperature over-runs in the cooking 
medium leading to burning of food items, oxidation of the cooking medium and 
consequential undesirable food taste and odour quite apart from the added energy 
costs. This is the case with the apparatus of EP-A-0 168 359, where a boiler is 
used as heating means. US Patent No 4047476 relates to an improvement to the Crittal cooking 
apparatus

<CLAIMS>
A spray cooking apparatus (10) comprising; 

a housing (12) containing a cooking chamber (14) into which fluid 
cooking medium is sprayable from spray means (16) to cook food items 

present in said cooking chamber (14); 
buffer tank means (18) for storage of cooking fluid and receipt of cooking 
fluid from said cooking chamber (14); and 
circulation means (20;42) within said housing (12) to circulate cooking 
fluid from said buffer tank means (18) to said spray means (16),
 
   characterised in that 
at least one flow heater means (22) is arranged in said circulation means 
(20) to apply heat to the fluid cooking medium while it is in motion flowing in 

said circulation means, after it leaves said buffer tank means (18) and while 
flowing thence towards said spray means (16) by way of said circulation 

means (20), said flow heater means (22), by applying heat while the fluid is in 
movement, heating said cooking fluid to predetermined extent without 

overheating and being sufficient of itself to maintain cooking temperature once 
normal operating conditions have been established; 
and said heated fluid cooking medium being sprayed by said spray means 
(16) onto said food items while they are in motion on a conveying device 

moving through said cooking chamber (14). 
The cooking apparatus as claimed in claim 1 and in which said circulation 
means (20;42) includes pump means (42) to pump cooking medium from said 

buffer tank means (18) to said spray means (16) and including means to 
ensure that a predetermined level of cooking fluid is maintained in said buffer 

tank means (18) so that the fluid arriving at the flow heater means (22) is 
airfree.  

 
The cooking apparatus as claimed in either of claims 1 or 2 and in which 
a plurality of flow heater means (22) are arranged in said circulation means
