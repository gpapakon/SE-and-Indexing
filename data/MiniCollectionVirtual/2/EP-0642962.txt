<ABSTRACT>
A protection valve for fluid brake circuits of 
vehicles, has a first outlet (13) for connection to a control 

valve of a handbrake circuit, a second outlet (14) for 
connection to a control valve of a service brake circuit to 

respective outlets, and a single bleed conduit (18) connecting 
the first and second outlets (13,14) 

and containing a restrictor (19) and 
a non-return valve (20) in series. The bleed conduit (18) ensures 

that fluid pressure available in the handbrake circuit 
cannot exceed fluid pressure in the service brake circuit. 

Various configurations of protection valve are disclosed.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a valve for a vehicle
braking system, and particularly to a safety valve of an air
braking system for commercial vehicles.Wheel brakes of early motor vehicles were actuated
mechanically, by rods or cables. Fluid actuation, which
relies on driver or vehicle generated fluid pressure, has
been used since the 1930's and hydraulic actuation is the
preferred actuation method for light vehicles.Larger vehicles, such as lorries and buses, use air
actuation and a different kind of brake in which the wheel
brakes can be applied by a pre-loaded coil spring. An
engine driven pump provides air under pressure to separate
handbrake and service brake actuation circuits under the
control of respective driver-operated hand and foot valves.
Typically the driver's hand valve is used to admit air under
pressure to an actuator which opposes the actuation force of
the pre-loaded spring, thereby releasing the wheel brake and
permitting the wheel to roll. The foot valve causes
operation of the service brake by supplying air under
pressure to a service brake actuator.This kind of brake actuation is rather complex but has
the advantage that failure of the handbrake actuation
circuit causes immediate application of the wheel brake by
the pre-loaded coil spring. Furthermore the handbrake
actuation circuit may be used as an emergency brake in the
event of failure of the service brake actuation circuit. The vehicle air pump usually supplies a number of
fluid circuits; for example a vehicle may have two service
brake (footbrake) circuits, a handbrake/trailer brake
circuit, and an auxiliaries circuit for e.g. a clutch servo.
A reservoir is usually provided to give sufficient reserve
to ensure that the vehicle can be halted in the event of
engine failure or air pump failure. Valve means are usually
provided to ensure that a leak in one circuit will not
result in loss of pressure in all circuits. Such protection
valves may be quite complex in order that the air pump is
prevented from continuing to supply air under pressure to a
failed circuit. Typically a valve may include an element
movable to open flow from the source to the user, the valve
element being subject to a spring closing force which is
opposed by inlet pressure acting against a large area and
outlet pressure acting against a smaller area. The effect
of such a valve is that if outlet pressure is negligible
(indicating a circuit failure) the spring partially or
completely closes the valve since inlet pressure alone is
insufficient to move the valve

<CLAIMS>
A protection valve for fluid brake circuits of
vehicles, the valve having an inlet (12) for connection to a

source of fluid under pressure, a first outlet (13) for
connection to a control valve of a handbrake circuit, a

second outlet (14) for connection to a control valve of a
service brake circuit, isolating valve means (17) to permit

fluid flow from said inlet to respective outlets, said first
and second outlets (13,14) being connected downstream of

said isolating valve means (17), by a single bleed conduit (18)
having a restrictor (19) and a non-return valve (20) in series,

the bleed conduit (18) permitting flow from the first outlet
(13) to the second outlet (14) only, characterised in that the

restrictor (19) is sized to permit excess pressure to bleed
from said first outlet (13) to said second outlet (14) whilst

allowing pressure at said first outlet (13) to reach a
predetermined minimum which will allow operation of the

vehicle handbrake in use.
A protection valve according to claim 1 and
including a third outlet (15) for connection to a second

service brake circuit and supplied via isolating valve
means.
A protection valve according to claim 2 wherein
said first and third outlets (14,15) are connected by a

single bleed conduit (21) downstream of said isolating valve
means, the bleed conduit (21) having a restrictor (22) and non-return

valve (23) in series and permitting flow from the first 
outlet (13) to the third outlet (15) only, and the restrictor (22)

being of a size to permit excess pressure to bleed from said
first outlet (13) to said third outlet (15) whilst allowing

pressure at said first outlet (13) to reach a predetermined
minimum which will allow operation of the vehicle handbrake

in use.
A protection valve according to any preceding
claim and having an auxiliaries outlet (16) for connection to

auxiliaries, said auxiliaries and second outlets (16,14) being
connected downstream of said isolating valve means (17), by a

single bleed conduit having a restrictor and a non-return
valve in series, the bleed conduit permitting flow from the

auxiliaries outlet (16) to the second outlet (14) only, and the
restrictor being of a size to permit excess pressure to

bleed from said auxiliaries outlet to said second outlet
whilst allowing pressure at said auxiliaries outlet to reach

a predetermined minimum which will allow operation of
auxiliaries in use.
