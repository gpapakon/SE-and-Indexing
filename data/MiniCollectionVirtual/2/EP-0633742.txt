<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates in general to a framework 
suitable for use as a shelving unit and more particularly 
to a framework which may be readily assembled and 
disassembled by a user. It is known in the prior art 
for example from FR-A-2392627 to provide a 
framework which may be used as the basis of a shelving unit 
work bench or similar structure and which may be assembled 
and disassembled for ease of transportation. Such 
frameworks are often used in warehouses and storage rooms 
and are fabricated from sheet metal which may be roll 
formed, stamped and cut to the desired shape for assembly. 
These frameworks are typically provided with four vertical 
corner posts and a plurality of horizontal members. The 
corner posts are often provided with a plurality of 
apertures for receiving screws or bolts to connect the 
horizontal members thereto at user selected heights. For example, CA-A-1,256,069 (Hirsh 
Company) discloses a shelving assembly having a plurality 
of generally horizontal shelves which are connected to four 
support columns or posts by conventional bolts or nuts. 
Specifically, each shelf is provided with a flange which 
defines, at its corners, one or more holes for receiving a 
bolt or screw which is then inserted through a selected 
hole or aperture in the vertical column or post. One disadvantage of the prior art design 
disclosed in the Hirsh Patent is that there are a 
multiplicity of components required for assembly, including 
the aforementioned nuts and bolts, as well as pliers and 
screwdrivers, etc. Furthermore, it is possible for the 
nuts and bolts to become loosened over time, thereby 
resulting in potential instability of the shelving 
assembly. According to another prior art technique, the 
horizontal members are connected to the vertical posts by 
means of rivets. The rivets are inserted in vertically  
 
arranged slots in the vertical poets. In an effort to 
provide a secure connection, the distance from the side 
edge (i.e. vertical face) of the vertical past to the 
side edge of the slot is made slightly different to the 
distance from the side edge (i.e. vertical edge) of the 
horizontal member to the neck of the rivet such that 
there is effectively no clearance between the rivet and 
the slot. Therefore, in order to install the rivet into 
the slot, the rivet must be hammered into place by 
hammering down on the horizontal member so as to distort 
the metal forming he side edge of the slot. This latter prior art technique also suffers 
from the disadvantage that the

the post member being juxtaposed, said attachment means 
(17a) comprising an aperture (11a) in one of said 

juxtaposed faces and having a hole (13a) and a slot (15a) 
extending therefrom and a protuberance with a neck (19a) 

and a head portion (21a) extending therefrom projecting 
from the other of said juxtaposed faces, said head portion 

(21a) being co-operatively shaped to pass through said hole 
(13a) and said neck (19a) to slide within said slot (15a), 

said neck portion (19a) and slot (15a) being configured to 
bring said edge (23a) of said support member (5a) into 

abutment with an abutment surface (34) on the post member 
(3a) upon relative sliding movement of said neck portion 

(19a) within said slot (15a) and thereby inhibit further 
sliding of the neck portion within the slot, characterized 

in that said abutment surface includes a rib (34) extending 
along the longitudinal axis of said post and projecting 

into the included angle between said faces (4a) of said 
post member (3a) to maintain said edges (23a) of support 

members (6a) connected to respective ones of said faces 
(4a) in spaced relationship. 
A framework according to claim 1 wherein said 
slot (15a) is disposed at an acute angle relative to the 

longitudinal axis of the post member (3a).  
 
A framework according to claim 2 wherein said 
apertures (11a) are formed in said faces (4a) of said post 

member (3a). 
A framework according to claim 1, 2 or 3 wherein 
said support member (6a) terminates in a flange (23) that 

extends between said rib (34) and said face (6a) and 
lateral edge portions (8a) extend from said support member 

(5a) to abut said rib. 
A framework according to claim 4 wherein said 
support member (5a) includes a ledge (8a) at opposite sides
