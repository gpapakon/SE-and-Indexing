<ABSTRACT>
At the feed side (22, 22′) of each antenna element (15, 15′) 
comprising transmitting conductor ways formed in turnback 

shape in continuation and having distributed constant impedance 
are electrically connected variable tuning units (16, 18) 

including an impedance adjusting element (23) and voltage 
variable capacitors (17, 17′). 
Antenna feed terminals (22, 22′) are connected through a 
coaxial cable to input terminals at a remoteset radio receiver. 

A tuning control signal generated within the radio receiver is 
fed to the voltage variable capacitors (17, 17′) at the antenna 

circuit through the coaxial cable. The tuning control signal 
allows the antenna circuit to resonate at a particular frequency 

within a frequency band, the frequency being variable in 
response to the control signal. The antenna element, having 

distributed constant inductance, functions to have the best 
antenna radiation efficiency at the resonant frequency by 

means of the variable tuning unit and is considerably smaller 
than a conventional dipole. 
At the resonant frequency, the characteristic impedance 
at the feed terminals to the antenna circuit becomes equal to 

that at the receiving input terminals connected to the antenna 
circuit, so as to increase efficiency of transfer of the signal 

from the antenna to the radio receiver.
