<ABSTRACT>
The liquid purification system (10) of the present 
invention has a double-tank structure comprising an inner 

tank (82) and an outer tank (80) that are in communication with one 
another so that either one of the microfiltration means (84) and 

the adsorption means (86) may be accommodated is in the inner 
tank (82), and the microfiltration means (84) or the adsorption means (86) 

that is not accommodated in the inner tank (82) may be 
accommodated in the outer tank (80), with the disinfection 

system being provided on the liquid line connecting the 
inner (82) and the outer tanks (80). Since the liquid purification 

system of the present invention has such an arrangement, 
the system is quite compact in size to facilitate an easy 

installation and maintenance at low cost while the system 
satisfies various performances required for the system used 

for the purification by filtration, disinfection and 
adsorption of pool water; drinking water and beverages; 

industrial water; waste water; rain water and water from 
river, lake or sea; and the like. It should also be noted 

that the liquid purification system of the present 
invention may be assembled by using porous ceramic filters (20) 

of commercially available dimension.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a liquid purification
system. More particularly, this invention relates to a
system for purifying a liquid such as pool water that is
compact in size and readily installable, and at the same
time, that is capable of purifying a large volume of liquid
at a high purification level.Various filtration systems have been proposed and
actually put in use in the production of drinking water
where water from river, lake, sea or drainage are purified.
In such system, a porous ceramic filter is often employed
for the filtration to remove various impurities and malodor
contaminants that are unsuitable for drinking water.
Various water purification systems for well or city water
are also commercially available wherein a porous ceramic
filter is utilized to remove the small amount of organic
and inorganic substances present in the water that are
responsible for the offensive odor and the poor taste.Porous ceramic filters are also employed in the
fermentation of beer, wine, sake, soy sauce, and the like,
where solids and impurities should be removed from the
fermentation products; and in the production of sauce,
beverage, fruit juice, edible oil, and the like, wherein
removal of solids and impurities are also required in their
production. Since the drinking water, the liquors, the 
beverages, fruit juices, sauces, and cooking oils as
mentioned above are to be taken in by drinking or eating,
severe requirements are imposed on the systems used for
their purification. Such systems are also required to have
a large capacity in the case of an industrial scale
production.With the deepening concern for pollution, strict
regulations have been established to control the quality of
waste water from factories, and the water purification
systems used for such purpose are required to have a higher
performance as well as a larger capacity. In near future,
waste waters from other businesses, schools, and facilities
as well as waste water from home will be subject to such
regulations. Accordingly, there are growing demands for
various types of high-performance, low-cost water
purification systems ranging from a small size to a large
size.Also, with the growing concern for physical fitness,
many people nowadays prefer swimming as an exercise
involving whole body that may promote their health and
relieve physical stress. Accordingly, an increasing
population, irrespective of their age or sex, often goes
swimming in pools.To allow such people enjoy swimming under safe and
clean conditions, pools must be kept
