<ABSTRACT>
The invention concerns a stock feed system for a 
multi-layer headbox (10) and a method in the operation 

of a multi-layer headbox. According to the 
invention, into each inlet header (11,12,13) of the 

multi-layer headbox (10), a stock concept (M₁, 
M₂...) is passed which has been produced out of the 

same fresh stock (M) by to the fresh stock adding 
the necessary chemicals and fillers.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention concerns a stock feed system for a multi-layer headbox and a method
in the operation of a multi-layer headbox.In the prior art (US-A-4 021 295), systems for the operation of multi-layer headboxes are known in
which there are separate fresh stocks for the surface layers and for the middle
layers. Thus, in the prior-art systems, there have been at least double fresh-stock
systems for the formation of the layers. In the solutions of equipment, the stocks
introduced along separate fresh-stock lines have been processed in vortex cleaning
and in de-aeration tanks, and in the system, into said at least two fresh-stock lines,
feeds of fillers or starch complying with the required paper grade have been passed.In the present application, it is suggested that, in a paper machine that comprises a
multi-layer headbox and therein at least two separate inlet headers or equivalent, for
the inlet headers, separate stocks are prepared out of the same fresh stock and from
the same stock tank. According to the invention, the fresh stock passed out of the
stock tank is divided into two or more component flows. Into said component flows
to be fed into the multi-layer headbox, the chemicals and/or additives purposeful for
the quality or the economy of production of different paper grades are passed.The stock system in accordance with the invention for a multi-layer headbox is
mainly characterized in that, into each inlet header of the multi-layer headbox, a
stock concept is passed which has been produced out of the same fresh stock by to
the fresh stock adding the necessary chemicals and fillers.The method in accordance with the invention is mainly characterized in that, in the
method, the stock for each header is prepared out of one and the same fresh stock
by to said fresh stock adding the necessary chemicals and fillers. The invention will be described in the following with reference to some preferred
embodiments of the invention illustrated in the figures in the accompanying drawing,
the invention being, yet, not supposed to be confined to said embodiments alone.Figure 1 shows a first preferred embodiment of the invention, in which the stock
flow passed out of the fresh-stock tank is divided into three component flows, which
are passed further, after feeds of chemicals and fillers, into the different inlet
headers in the multi-layer headbox.Figure 2 shows a second preferred embodiment of the stock feed system in accordance
with the invention for a multi-layer headbox.Fig. 1 is a schematic illustration of a
</DESCRIPTION>
<CLAIMS>
Stock feed system for a multi-layer headbox (10) for forming
multi-ply paper, wherein into each inlet header (11, 12, 13) of

the multi-layer headbox (10) different stock concepts (M
1
,
M
2
,...) are passed, 
characterized in that
 the stock concepts
(M
1
, M
2
, ...) for every ply are produced out of the same fresh
stock (M) from a common stock tank (17) by adding the necessary

chemicals and fillers to the fresh stock (M) after said fresh
stock is divided into separate stock flows.
Stock feed system as claimed in claim 1, 
characterized in
that
 the system comprises a fresh stock line (18al; 22al) from
said common stock tank, which line is branched into different

lines in accordance with the requirements of each particular
concept.
Method of operating a multi-layer headbox (10) for forming
multi-ply paper, wherein into each of at least two inlet 

headers (11, 12, ...) different stock concepts (M
1
, M
2
; M', M")
are passed and the stock being made to flow out of said inlet

headers (11, 12,..) and further brought to a system of
distributor pipes into a turbulence generator and further into

the slice cone (16), 
characterized in that
 the stock concepts
(M
1
, M2,...) for every ply are produced out of the same fresh
stock (M) from a common stock tank (17) by adding the necessary

chemicals and fillers to the fresh stock (M) after said fresh
stock is divided into separate stock flows.
Method as claimed in claim 3, 
characterized in that
 the
fresh stock (M) is made to flow through branch points into

different lines, a chemical being fed into each of said lines
in accordance with the requirements of the particular stock

concept to be fed into the inlet header of the multi-layer
headbox.
