<ABSTRACT>
A flagless semiconductor device (10) includes a 
semiconductor die (22) having a plurality of bond pads (26) which 

are electrically coupled to a plurality of leads (16) by wire bonds 
(28). The die is supported by two cantilevered tie bars (18). Use of 

cantilevered tie bars decreases the total plastic-metal interface 
area in a plastic encapsulated device, thereby lessening the 

probability of internal delamination and package cracking. The 
cantilevered tie bars also permit a variety of die sizes to be used 

with the same lead frame design. Suitable configurations for 
cantilevered tie bars include, but are not limited to, U-shape, T-shape, 

and H-shape configurations.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates generally to semiconductor 
devices, and more specifically to flagless semiconductor devices 
and methods for making the same. Package cracking is a common problem in plastic 
encapsulated semiconductor devices. The problem arises from a 
combination of factors. One factor is an internal delamination 
between the plastic encapsulant material and a flag of a lead 
frame. The flag is a plate-like member of a conventional lead 
frame which supports the die. The flag, like the rest of the lead 
frame, is usually made of copper, a copper-alloy, or an iron-nickel 
alloy, and therefore has a coefficient of thermal expansion (CTE) 
which in most instances is different than that of the surrounding 
molding compound or plastic. As a result of this CTE mismatch, 
stress is created at the plastic-flag interface as the 
semiconductor device experiences temperature changes. The 
stress, upon reaching a maximum threshold, is relieved through 
delamination of the plastic-flag interface. Another factor involved 
in package cracking is moisture absorption. After the plastic-flag 
interface becomes delaminated, moisture from the environment 
diffuses through the molding compound to the delaminated area. 
Once moisture accumulates in the package, rapid temperature 
increases will cause the moisture to vaporize and expand, thereby 
creating an internal pressure pocket in the delaminated area. To 
relieve the pressure and associated stress, the surrounding plastic 
cracks. The most common occurrence of package cracking occurs 
when a user attaches a plastic semiconductor device to a substrate  
 
using a solder reflow operation. The high temperatures associated 
with solder reflow induce a rapid temperature increase which is 
often sufficient, depending on the moisture content of the device, 
to cause the plastic to crack. There are numerous existing methods of dealing with the 
problem of package cracking. One method is dry-packing, which 
involves baking plastic encapsulated semiconductor devices 
sufficiently to reduce moisture content and packaging the devices 
into moisture resistant packets. Device users then attach the 
device before a sufficient amount of moisture to cause cracking can 
be absorbed into the package through exposure to ambient 
conditions. This method is effective, but significantly increases 
the costs of semiconductor devices. Moreover, device users must 
keep track of how long devices have been exposed to the ambient 
conditions to assure that any absorbed moisture is
