<ABSTRACT>
A screw cap contains, on its cylindrical outer wall, a grooving which continues into the outer annular region of the lid section. The grooving consists of lamella ribs each having a slightly inclined long side and a short side which lies in a plane lying around the longitudinal mid-axis of the container closure. An outer cap which can be fitted onto the screw cap has a lid section which is convex relative to the screw cap, is supported centrally on the lid section of the screw cap, and can be deformed elastically into an approximately flat alignment by applying axial force. During this process, projections moulded onto the inner side of the lid section of the outer cap engage in the grooving of the lid section of the screw cap so that a torque can be transmitted in the opening direction. In the opposite direction of rotation, the outer cap is connected by end faces of an annular shoulder to projections of the screw cap. The screw cap can be used as a single closure or in combination with the outer cap as a child-resistant pressure/rotary closure.

Container closure with a screw cap (1) and a childproof
outer cap (2), which can be snapped onto the latter and with

which the screw cap (1) can be rotated, wherein the screw
cap (1) comprises first fluting in the radially outer

annular region of its lid section (6), and projections (17)
are moulded onto the inside, which faces the screw cap (1),

of the outer cap (2), which projections engage in the first
fluting when the outer cap (2) undergoes elastic deformation

such that a torque can be transmitted to the first fluting
and the screw cap (1) can be unscrewed from the container

(5), wherein the outer cap (2) engages by way of a radially
inward pointing extension (20) under a downward pointing

annular shoulder (10) of the screw cap (1), and wherein the
outer cap (2) is connected to the screw cap (1) via a

second, separate engagement device (21, 22) just to rotate
the screw cap (1) in the closing direction, characterised in

that the screw cap (1) comprises second fluting (8) at its
preferably cylindrical outer wall (3), which fluting

facilitates the rotation of the screw cap (1) when the outer
cap (2) is not seated on the screw cap, that the first and

the second fluting consist of consecutive, lamellar ribs
which each comprise a gently inclined, long side (11), which

points in the rotational direction for opening, and a short
side (12), which preferably lies approximately in the plane

comprising the central longitudinal axis (13) of the
container closure and points in the rotational direction for

closing, such that the fluting forms a saw-toothed profile
in a sectional view, and that the lid section (15) of the

outer cap (2) is of a form which is convex in relation to
the lid section (6) of the screw cap (1) and which is

supported centrally on the lid section (6) of the screw cap
(1) and can be elastically deformed in a substantially plane

orientation, which causes the projections (17) to engage in
the first fluting, by applying axial pressure. 
Container closure according to claim 1, characterised in
that, in the centre of its lid section (6), the screw cap

(1) comprises a trough-shaped depression (7) in which a
correspondingly shaped, pre-arched section (16) of the lid

part (15) of the outer cap (2) engages.
Container closure according to claim 1 or 2,
characterised in that the projections (17) on the lid

section (15) of the outer cap (2) have a cross-sectional
form which corresponds to the cross-sectional form of a rib

of the first fluting.
Container closure according to one of claims 1 to 3,
characterised in that the inward pointing annular extension

of the outer cap (2) comprises a plurality of sections (20)
in the circumferential direction which gradually widen

radially inwards and have end faces (21) which, when the
outer cap (2) is rotated in the closing direction, strike

projections (22) which are moulded onto the outer wall of
the screw cap (1).
Container closure according to one of claims 1 to 4,
characterised in that the end faces (21) of the radially

widening sections (20) of the annular extension and/or the
facing end faces of the projections (22) of the screw cap

(1) are inclined at a small angle to the radial such that,
when a predetermined torque is exceeded, the end faces (21)

slide past the projections (22) while the annular extension
widens radially.
Container closure according to one of claims 1 to 5,
characterised in that the second fluting (8) at the

cylindrical wall (3) is flush on the outside in the radial
direction with a closed annular section (9) which forms the

stepped annular shoulder (10) at its underside.
Container closure according to one of claims 1 to 6,
characterised in that the first fluting at the top side is

flush with a circular, smooth centre section which is plane 
apart from the central trough-shaped depression (7).
Container closure according to one of claims 1 to 7,
characterised in that the second fluting also consists of

consecutive, lamellar ribs which each comprise a gently
inclined, long side (11) and a short, steeply inclined side

(12), and that the second fluting of the outer wall
continues without interruption in the identically shaped

first fluting of the annular region of the lid section.
Container closure according to claim 4, characterised in
that the projections at the lower edge of the outer wall of

the screw cap (1) are likewise formed by saw-toothed fluting
of an opposite inclination with respect to the other fluting

(8).
Container closure according to one of claims 1 to 9,
characterised in that the outer surface of the screw cap (1)

does not comprise any projections and/or recesses which
constitute a risk of injury.
