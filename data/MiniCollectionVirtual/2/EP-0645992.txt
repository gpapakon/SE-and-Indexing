<ABSTRACT>
An impactor/extractor holder (10) for a femoral trial and/or a knee implant (30; 130) to hold and guide those items onto the resected end (110) of a femur. The impactor/extractor holder (10) comprises two opposed clamping arms (22) for gripping the opposite outer edges of the trial and/or implant (30; 130), and an abutment table (54) movable relative to the clamping arms (22) so as to be capable of being advanced against the outer surface of the trial and/or implant (30; 130) after the sides have been clamped by the clamping jaws (22). The abutment table (54) has a cushioning surface (58) for contacting the trial and/or implant (30; 130) which is adapted not to damage the outer surface of the implant or trial (30; 130). A threaded mechanism (44, 46 and 50) is provided for moving the abutment table (54) relative to the clamping jaws (22) to advance the abutment table (54) against the outer surface of the implant or the trial (30; 130) to securely and rigidly lock the trial or implant (30; 130) on the impactor/extractor holder (10). A trial rasp (130) is also disclosed.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates generally to
instrumentation for preparing the distal end
of the femur for the femoral component of an artificial
knee implant, and for positioning the femoral component of
the implant on the prepared distal end of the femur.In particular the invention relates to an impactor/extractor
holder for a femoral trial and/or knee implant to hold and guide
those items onto the resected end of a femur as specified in the
preamble of Claim 1. Such a device is known e.g. from US-A-5 059 196.In the replacement of a knee by an artificial
joint, it is necessary to shape the distal end of the
femur by making a number of cuts through the condyles to
precisely receive the femoral component of the replacement
joint. The femoral component is of hollow bowl or
generally "C" shape, and its has a generally concave inner
surface designed to fit with the cut end of the femur.
The cuts which are made may need some slight adjustments
in order to ensure that the implant will ultimately fit
very closely over the resected bone with what is known as
an interference fit, that is, a tight fit such that the
implant could be, for example, up to 2% smaller than the
bone to which it is to be fitted. In this way the implant
will be a tight fit on the bone and there will be no
chance of the implant rocking on the bone and so leading
to failure. Also any gaps or deviations greater than this
are counterproductive with respect to bone incorporation
into the surfaces of the implant.When preparing the femur to receive its
respective component of the artificial knee joint, the
various cuts are made using a guide which should result in
a final reasonably accurate shape, see for example, the
guide described in copending EP-A-648 094 or the corresponding
WO 94/00056, both published after the priority of the present
invention In particular, those condylar cuts which
are across the axis of the bone and which take most of the
load, do not contribute much to the interference fit of
the implant and are angled to optimize load distribution 
between the bone and the implant whilst also ensuring bone
incorporation. However, those condylar cuts which run
parallel or close to parallel to the axis of the bone do
need further preparation to ensure the final accurate
interference fit and ideally this is achieved by making
the appropriate cuts such that the bone is very slightly
over size and then subjecting it to a final rasping action
to achieve the exact size required.Once the cuts have been made it is usual for a
femoral trial, which is
