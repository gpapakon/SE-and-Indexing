<DESCRIPTION>
This invention pertains to disposable absorbent articles, and 
methods of making same. Currently, disposable absorbent articles find widespread use 
in the areas of adult care, infant care, and child care, and 
have generally replaced reusable cloth articles. Disposable 
diapers have met a particular need and have become 
increasingly popular. However, even though these diapers are 
popular, they continue to have several problems. One of 
these problems pertains to the containment and absorbent 
features of the diaper. Although current disposable diapers 
have elasticized leg openings, these elasticised leg openings 
are not entirely successful in stopping leakage of urine or 
rapidly discharged liquid bowel movements. One attempt to eliminate this leakage is the provision of a 
pair of containment flaps spaced inwardly of the elasticized 
leg openings. These flaps are intended to reduce the leakage 
of waste material at the elasticized leg openings. In 
practice, however, leakage still occurs. Once a child reaches an age of about 15 to 30 months, a 
parent or caretaker generally desires to start toilet 
training so the child can become independent of the parent or 
caretaker. A training pant is intended for use when the 
child has reached an age at which he or she is ready to 
graduate to underpants, which are three-dimensional articles, 
as a replacement for disposable diapers, which are 
two-dimensional articles. A suitable disposable training 
pant is an article having closed sides so that a child will 
raise and lower the pant as necessary without requiring, 
hopefully, the aid of a parent. A child puts the training 
pant on by placing his or her feet in the respective leg  
 
openings and pulling the pant upwardly along the legs to fit 
the pant snugly at the crotch. This is significantly 
different from the way a diaper is fitted. Although it is hoped by the parent that the child will not 
have an accident while wearing a training pant, it is highly 
probable that it will occur. Thus, there is a need to 
provide an improved child's training pant that will absorb 
and contain body waste, and do so in a manner that reduces, 
if not eliminates, leakage. The invention therefore provides a disposable article 
according to any one of independent claims 1,4 or 5 and a 
method of making a disposable absorbent article according to 
any one of independent claims 15, 18 or 19. Further 
advantageous features, aspects and details of the invention 
are evident from the dependent claims, the description and
