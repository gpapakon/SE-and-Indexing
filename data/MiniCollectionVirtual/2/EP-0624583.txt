<ABSTRACT>
Substituted mono- and bipyridylmethylpyridones are prepared either by reaction of pyridones with mono- or bipyridylmethylhalogen compounds or by reaction of pyridone-substituted halopyridines with tetrazolylphenylboronic acids. The substituted mono- and bipyridylmethylpyridones can be employed as active compounds in medicaments, in particular for the treatment of arterial hypertension and atherosclerosis.

R
7''
has the abovementioned meaning of R
7
 but does 
not represent the tetrazolyl radical, 
 
in inert solvents in the presence of a base and 

under metal catalysis,
 
and, in the case where X = a triphenylmethyl group,
