<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a thermoplastic resin composition 
in which compatibility of a polyolefin type resin and a 
saturated polyester is improved, a balance between heat 
resistance and mechanical strength is excellent and also 
molding processability, water absorption resistance and 
appearance of a molded product are excellent, and a process 
for preparing a modified polyolefin type resin having 
excellent adhesiveness, coatability, printability and 
polymer-modifying property, by subjecting a polyolefin type 
resin to graft polymerization with a monomer having a polar 
functional group. A polyolefin type resin represented by a polypropylene 
resin and a polyethylene resin has low specific gravity, a 
low price and also excellent mechanical strength, luster, 
transparency, moldability, water absorption resistance and 
chemical resistance so that it has been widely used alone 
or as one component of a polymer blend for preparing various 
molded products. However, the polyolefin type resin 
has a non-polar molecular structure so that its affinity 
for other substance is poor, whereby various characteristics  
 
such as adhesiveness, coatability, printability, 
antistatic property and compatibility in a polymer blend 
are extremely poor. Also, heat resistance of the polyolefin 
type resin is not so high, and such a drawback is an 
obstacle to its use as an engineering plastics. On the other hand, a saturated polyester represented by 
polybutylene terephthalate and polyethylene terephthalate 
has been recognized as an engineering plastics having 
excellent heat resistance, chemical resistance and electrical 
characteristics. However, the saturated polyester 
has a drawback that water absorption resistance is poor so 
that water is easily absorbed into the saturated polyester 
during molding processing such as injection molding and 
extrusion molding and especially under conditions of high 
temperature and high humidity, whereby physical properties 
such as impact resistance are lowered. As attempts to cope with the case where desired 
various properties cannot be satisfied sufficiently by one 
resin material, there has been frequently used a technique 
of compensating insufficient properties by mixing it with 
other resin material. If a composition having both good 
properties of the saturated polyester and the polyolefin 
type resin and compensating undesirable properties each 
other can be obtained by such a technique, an excellent 
resin material having a wide application field can be 
provided.
