<ABSTRACT>
Low-pressure discharge lamp which has caps on two sides and a tubular discharge vessel which is to be built into plug-in sockets (16). One cap sleeve (3) each is fitted over the two ends of the discharge vessel, which ends are closed hermetically by pinches or plate-type seals. The edges which are oriented in the direction of the longitudinal axis of the low-pressure discharge lamp, of the end sections of the cap sleeves are replaced by sections (11a,b) which are reduced in terms of material, so that even in the case of a rotation of the two caps (17) with respect to each other through a typical rotation angle  alpha  of 5@, optimal contact is ensured between the caps (17) and the associated plug-in sockets (16).

Double-base low-pressure discharge lamp (1) with 
a tubular discharge vessel (2), closed off in gas-tight 

fashion at each of the ends by a pinch seal (24) or a 
flare mount (25), an electrode (20) arranged near each of 

the ends, and two pairs of current supply leads (21a,b) 
which are electrically connected to the two ends of the 

electrode (20), 

the current supply leads (21a,b) being, in the plane 
of 
the pinch seal (24) or of the pinch-seal portion 
(23) of the flare mount (25), fed out from the discharge 

vessel (2) parallel to the axis, 
a base shell (3) being fitted over each of the two 
ends of the discharge vessel, which shell has, at its 

free end, a cylindrical portion which has an essentially 
rectangular cross-section and whose outer 

surface consists of mutually parallel side walls 
(5a,b) and narrow walls (18a,b) essentially perpendicular 

thereto, 
at the end face (7), the respective base-shell end 
portion (4) has two bores (8a,b) which are essentially 

in the plane of the pinch seals (24) or of the pinch-seal 
portion (23) of the flare mount (25) and through 

which the two current supply leads (21a,b) are led 
out, 
outside the base-shell end portion (4), the current 
supply leads (21a,b) are bent off in opposite directions 

and are led back in the direction of the discharge 
vessel (2), parallel to the axis of the discharge 

vessel (2), on the opposite plane side walls  
 

(5a,b) of the cylindrical base-shell end portion (4), 
 
characterized in that at least two of the edges formed by 

the plane side walls (5a,b) and the narrow walls (18a,b) 
are replaced by relieved portions which extend over the 

entire length of the base-shell end portion (4). 
Low-pressure discharge lamp according to Claim 1, 
characterized in that the relieved portions each start 

near the current supply leads (21a,b) applied to the 
plane side wall (5a,b) of the base-shell end portion (4) 

and extend to that wall belonging to the narrow side of 
the rectangular cross-section of the base-shell end 

portion (4) which lies further away. 
Low-pressure discharge lamp according to Claim 1, 
characterized in that the relieved portions are 

configured as planar bevels (11a,b). 
Low-pressure discharge lamp according to Claim 3, 
characterized in that the planar bevels (11a,b) are 

configured in such a way that the planar faces of the 
bevels form an angle β in the range 0 
<
 β ≤ 10° with the 
plane formed by the bores (8a,b) and the longitudinal 

axis of the lamp. 
Low-pressure discharge lamp according to Claim 1, 
characterized in that the relieved portions are 

configured as concavely curved faces (13a,b) in the form 
of a flat channel. 
Low-pressure discharge lamp according to Claim 1, 
characterized in that the relieved portions are 

configured as convexly curved faces (12a,b) with a large 
radius of curvature. 
Low-pressure discharge lamp according to Claim 2, 
characterized in that the edges at the junction of the 

relieved portions with the plane side walls (5a,b) are 
rounded.
