<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to oral compositions such as liquid 
dentifrices, toothpastes, mouthwashes, chewing gum, tablets and 
powders which provide antiplaque and antigingivitis benefits. Plaque is recognized as a precursor of such oral diseases as 
caries and gingivitis. The gums of the mouth of humans and lower 
animals may be harmed by deposits of dental plaque, a combination of 
minerals and bacteria found in the mouth. The bacteria associated 
with plaque can secrete enzymes and endotoxins which can irritate the 
gums and cause an inflammatory gingivitis. As the gums become 
increasingly irritated by this process they have a tendency to bleed, 
lose their toughness and resiliency, and separate from the teeth, 
leaving periodontal pockets in which debris, secretions, more bacteria 
and toxins further accumulate. It is also possible for food to 
accumulate in these pockets, thereby providing nourishment for 
increased growth of bacteria and production of endotoxins and 
destructive enzymes. This can result in destruction of bone and gum 
tissue. With such problems being possible from plaque/gingivitis it is 
not surprising that extensive efforts have been expended in trying to 
find effective treatment compositions. Many of these efforts have 
used quaternary ammonium compounds or bis-biquanides such as 
chlorhexidine which is used in PeridexÂ® sold by The Procter & Gamble 
Company. Another material which has been considered is stannous ion. Such 
a material is disclosed in Svatun B., "Plaque Inhibiting Effect of 
Dentifrices Containing Stannous Fluoride", Acta Odontol . Scand., 36, 
205-210 (1978); and Bay I., and Rolla, G., "Plaque Inhibition and 
Improved Gingival Condition by Use of a Stannous Fluoride Toothpaste", 
Scand. J. Dent. Res., 88, 313-315 (1980). Additionally stannous 
fluoride stabilized with stannous gluconate has been used to treat 
plaque and gingivitis and disclosed in U.S. Patent 5,004,597, April 2,  
 
1991 to Majeti et al. In spite of the many disclosures in the antiplaque/antigingivitis 
area, the need for products still exists. The present invention is 
directed to the recognition that stannous gluconate when used without 
stannous fluoride, or with only very low levels of this material can 
provide plaque and gingivitis reductions. It is an object of the present invention therefore to provide 
compositions which deliver an improved antiplaque/antigingivitis 
benefit. It is a further object of the present invention to provide 
improved products utilizing stannous

<CLAIMS>
An oral composition effective in treating plaque/gingivitis 
comprising: 


(a) a safe and effective amount of stannous gluconate; and 
(b) a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier 
 
wherein the ph of said composition is from 3.0 to 5.0 and 

said composition comprises less than 2.0% of a calcium ion source(s) and 
less than 0.05% stannous fluoride. 
An oral composition according to Claim 1 wherein the amount of 
stannous gluconate is from 0.1% to 11%.

pharmaceutically acceptable carrier is a toothpaste which also 

contains an effective amount of sodium monofluorophosphate. 
An oral composition according to any of Claims 1-3 which also contains 
a silica dental abrasive. 
An oral composition according to any of Claims 1-4 which also contains 
another stannous salt. 
An oral composition according to Claim 2 wherein the pharmaceutically 
acceptable carrier is a mouthwash. 
An oral composition according to Claim 6 which also contains a 
material selected from a humectant, ethanol, a 

nonionic surfactant and mixtures thereof. 
An oral composition according to Claim 2 wherein the pharmaceutically 
acceptable carrier is a lozenge. 
An oral composition according to Claim 2 wherein the pharmaceutically 
acceptable carrier is a chewing gum.
