<ABSTRACT>
The invention protects circuits connected to low-power stimulation or detection electrodes of an implantable medical device against high-power pulses generated by the device itself and by external devices such as external defibrillators. It also protects the cardiac tissue close to the low-power electrodes. The invention provides a one-way current limiter (13-16) of the automatic type and/or the type using foldback, in each low-power conductor. The invention, when it is applied to an implantable cardiac defibrillator/stimulator (pacemaker) also provides a shock generator (9) applying pulses to the stimulation electrodes (11, 12) only in the direction which is blocked by the current limiter.
