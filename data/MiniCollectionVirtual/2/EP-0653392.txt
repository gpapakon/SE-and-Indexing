<ABSTRACT>
A porous ceramic combining a high porosity with a high strength and serving as a catalyst support or a filter for 

removing foreign matter from fluid. A porous ceramic having a porosity of 30 % or above comprises mainly columnar 
ceramic particles having an aspect ratio of 3 or above. In particular, a porous silicon nitride ceramic comprises mainly 

Si₃N₄ wherein prismatic β-Si₃N₄ particles amount to at least 60 % of the total amount of silicon nitride particles and 
further contains at least one compound of a rare earth element in an amount of 1-20 

vol.% in terms of the oxide of the 
rare earth element. The silicon nitride ceramic may further contain at least one compound of a group IIa, group IIIb 

or transition metal element in an amount of at most 5 vol.% in terms of the oxide of the element. The porous silicon 
nitride ceramic is produced by heat-treating a molding of a powdery mixture comprising powdery silicon nitride and 

a powdery rare earth compound at 1,500 °C or above in a nitrogen-containing 
atmosphere.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention generally relates to a ceramics
porous body which is useful as a filter material for
removing foreign matters from a fluid or a catalytic
carrier, and more specifically, it relates to a silicon
nitride ceramics porous body and a method of preparing the
same.As porous bodies which are employed for filter
materials or catalytic carriers, known are those
consisting of various materials such as resin, metals or
ceramics. Among these, a filter or a catalytic carrier
consisting of a ceramics material is generally employed
under environment of a high temperature or strong
corrosiveness which cannot be coped by other materials. A
filter or a catalytic carrier consisting of oxide ceramics
such as alumina (Al2O3) has already been put into practice.As to a porous body consisting of nonoxide ceramics,
on the other hand, only small examples have been put into
practice while Japanese Patent Laying-Open No. 63-291882
discloses a silicon nitride based or silicon carbide based
porous body which is prepared by a heat treatment.
Further, Japanese Patent Laying-Open No. 1-188479 
discloses a method of compacting mixed powder of silicon
powder and silicon nitride powder of relatively coarse
particles and thereafter nitriding the same thereby
preparing a porous body as a solid target.As hereinabove described, it is difficult to use a
porous body consisting of resin or a metal under a high
temperature or corrosive atmosphere. It is inevitably
necessary to employ a porous body which is made of
ceramics for a filter for removing foreign matters from a
high-temperature exhaust gas or a carrier serving as a
catalyst for decomposing a harmful matter.As such porous bodies which are made of ceramics,
those of alumina have been put into practice. While the
porous bodies of alumina are varied in pore size, porosity
and bending strength, that having porosity of 35 to 40 %
and a mean pore size of 25 to 130 µm has bending strength
of 20 to 35 MPa, and strength of the porous body is
insufficient depending on its use.In the silicon nitride based porous body which is
disclosed in the aforementioned Japanese Patent Laying-Open
No. 63-291882, porosity is less than 30 % and fluid
permeability is insufficient. In general, strength of
ceramics tends to be reduced following increase in
porosity, and it has been extremely difficult to attain
compatibility between the porosity and the strength. Accordingly, the present invention has been proposed
in order to solve the aforementioned problems, and an
object thereof is to
