<ABSTRACT>
Disclosed is an infusion pump and a fluid container for expelling a fluid from the fluid container to a patient. The pump comprises a housing (12, 16) having a chamber (17) therein for receiving the fluid reservoir (18). A first wall (38) is provided on the housing for contacting the fluid reservoir, and a second wall (24) is movable from a first position distanced from the first wall to form the chamber (17) therebetween, and a second position relatively closer to the first wall (38). Advancing the movable wall from the first position to the second position expels fluid from the collapsible reservoir. Preferably, the first and second walls (24, 38) are provided with non-planar complementary surface configurations for contacting the collapsible reservoir (18). Retraction mechanisms for retracting the movable wall from the second position to the first position, and user readable indicium of the status of the dispensation cycle are also disclosed.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a low cost drug delivery system
useful in delivering drugs, from pliable plastic containers.Many drugs in the healthcare field are administered to a
patient on a continuous basis. Continuous delivery of a drug
to a patient was initially achieved by placing a drug delivery
bag filled with a drug above the patient and letting gravity
force the drug from the bag into the patient. Although this
method has proven successful for many applications, its
drawbacks included (a) an unsteady flow to the patient due to
the changing height of the intravenous infusion site relative
to the drug bag, (b) the awkwardness of requiring the patient
to remain below the fluid delivery bag at all times, and (c)
the constant adjustment of a roller clamp which regulates the
flow to the patient. Electromechanical infusion pumps were
developed to mitigate these concerns. However, the utility of
such pumps was hindered by their bulky size and by their need
for a constant source of electricity. These hindrances are
especially troublesome in situations where a patient is at
home and ambulatory, thus requiring the freedom to move about.During the past five years, a new style of apparatus has
entered the marketplace for controlled delivery of a drug
which does not require the use of an electromechanical
infusion pump, and thus is suited for the controlled delivery
of drugs to patients who are ambulatory. This new style
utilizes an inflatable latex rubber balloon housed inside a
rigid, clear plastic housing. When the devices are filled
with a drug, the latex balloon expands. An administration set
is attached to the device and thus acts as the conduit for the
drug to the patient. When the balloon is inflated by the
drug, the balloon itself becomes the driving force to transfer
the drug out cf the reservoir to the patient via the drug
administration set. Controlled release of the drug at a
desired flow rate is achieved by placing an orifice of
predetermined diameter in the drug line. These devices 
generally operated at a relatively high pressures of
approximately 68947.5 Pa to 103421.3 Pa (10 to 15 psi). Examples of the latex balloon
system are disclosed in US Patent Nos. 4 769 008 and
4 915 693 and European Patent Application 0 426 319 A2.An example of the device for feeding fluid from a flexible
container is disclosed in US-A-4 157 771, which is used as a basis for the
preamble of claims 1 and 41. The container is
compressible by a pressure plate which is movable toward and
away from a stationary plate to form
