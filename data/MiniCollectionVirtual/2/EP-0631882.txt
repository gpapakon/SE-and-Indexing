<ABSTRACT>
A thermal transfer ink comprising a coloring 
agent and a heat-meltable vehicle containing a wax 

component, the wax component containing not less than 15 % 
by weight of a wax, the wax being a reaction product 

obtained by reacting an alcohol mixture of a straight-chain 
aliphatic primary monohydric alcohol having 10 to 22 

carbon atoms and 1 to 50 % by mole, on the basis of the 
amount of the alcohol mixture, of an aliphatic polyhydric 

alcohol with tolylene diisocyanate in a ratio of NCO/OH = 
0.8 to 1.0 by mole. A thermal transfe
r element is also 
disclosed wherein on a support is provided a thermal 

transfer ink layer formed from the thermal transfer ink by 
a solvent coating method.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a thermal 
transfer ink and a thermal transfer element using the 
same. Hitherto, there has widely been employed a 
thermal transfer ink for use in a thermal transfer 
element, which ink contains a coloring agent and a 
heat-meltable vehicle which is composed of a wax, or a wax 
and a heat-meltable resin. However, in the case of a solvent coating type 
thermal transfer ink containing a wax which is dissolved 
or dispersed into a solvent for application, the coating 
liquid thereof needs to be kept under heating at a 
temperature higher than room temperature in the 
preparation and application thereof due to the poor 
solubility of the wax used. In removing the solvent by 
drying after the application, the solvent does not readily 
vaporize, i.e. the drying property of a wet coating of the 
coating liquid is poor, which causes problems such as a 
prolonged drying period and formation of an ununiform ink 
layer. The dispersibility of coloring agents, such as 
carbon black, to waxes is generally poor, which causes 
agglomeration of the coloring agent in the ink. For this 
reason, both inks of solvent coating type and hot-melt 
coating type have problems such as poor ink stability, 
poor coating property and difficulty of forming printed 
images with a high density. In view of the foregoing, it is an object of the 
present invention to provide a thermal transfer ink which 
is excellent all in solubility to a solvent for 
application, solvent drying property, ink stability, 
coating property and printing property (print image 
density) in spite of using a wax as a vehicle, and a 
thermal transfer element using the same.  This and other objects of the invention will 
become apparent from the description hereinafter. The present invention provides a thermal transfer 
ink comprising a coloring agent and a heat-meltable 
vehicle containing a wax component, the wax component 
containing not less than 15 % by weight of a wax, the wax 
being a reaction product obtained by reacting an alcohol 
mixture of a straight-chain aliphatic primary monohydric 
alcohol having 10 to 22 carbon atoms and 1 to 50 % by 
mole, on the basis of the amount of the alcohol mixture, 
of an aliphatic polyhydric alcohol with tolylene 
diisocyanate in a ratio of NCO/OH = 0.8 to 1.0 by mole. The present invention further provides a thermal 
transfer element comprising a support and a thermal 
transfer ink layer, the thermal transfer ink layer being 
formed by applying the foregoing thermal transfer ink onto 
th
