<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to devices and
methods for obtaining oral fluid for testing.Parry, J.V., et al., Lancet 2:72-75 (1987).Thieme, T., et al., J. Clin. Microbiol. 20:1076-1079
(1992a).Thieme, T., et al., "Oral Fluid Sampling for
Determination of HIV-I Antibody Serostatus," Abstract
from VIII Int'l. Conf. on AIDS, pg. C328 (1992b).A number of analytical procedures and devices
are commonly used to test body fluids for the presence
of substances of diagnostic value. Blood and
urine are the body fluids of choice. An advantage of
blood as a test fluid is that analytes are often at
relatively high concentrations, and measurements of
these concentrations can often provide information
about a patient's health. Urine is useful for diagnostic
testing when the blood component of interest
(e.g., a low molecular weight drug or hormone) is
concentrated during urine formation. However, the
urine concentration of an analyte does not usually
reflect the physiologically active amount of the
analyte in blood.Although saliva is not commonly used as a body
fluid in medical diagnosis, numerous studies (Parry,
et al.; Thieme, et al., 1992 a,b) have demonstrated
that saliva and other types of oral fluid can provide
a reliable sample for diagnostic testing involving
antibodies or antigens specific for various human or
animal pathogens. Oral fluids have also been shown 
to be useful in measuring the body levels of naturally
occurring hormones or therapeutic and other drugs.One advantage of sampling oral fluid over sampling
blood and urine is the convenience of obtaining
the sample. A trained phlebotomist is not required,
as is the case with blood, nor are special arrangements
for privacy-in-collection and custody of the
sample required, as is the case with urine. Furthermore,
collection of an oral fluid sample obviates the
hazard of handling blood-contaminated needles and
tubes.Devices for the collection of oral fluid have
been described. U.S. Patent Nos. 4,418,702 and
4,580,577 show an absorbent pad for absorbing oral
fluid, and a barrel-piston arrangement for extracting
the fluid from the pad.U.S. Patent No. 4,774,962 describes an absorbent
pad for absorbing saliva, and a centrifuge tube and
tube-insert for removing oral fluid from the pad by
centrifugation.U.S. Patent 5,056,521 describes an apparatus for
use in monitoring glucose in oral fluid. The apparatus
includes a barrel-piston arrangement having a
nonreactive absorbent swab secured to the piston.
The barrel and piston are used to squeeze the fluid
sample from

<CLAIMS>
A device for obtaining oral fluid that
contains substances for testing comprising:


an absorbent pad (10) for recovering a test substance
from oral fluid;
means for extracting from the pad oral fluid
that has been absorbed into the pad, wherein said

means includes a syringe (54) composed of a barrel (12), and a
plunger (11) having an inner end to which the absorbent

pad is attached; characterized in that,
at the outlet end of the barrel, a fluid
passageway (33) which contains detection reagent means (34)

effective to be released into the oral fluid when
oral fluid is expelled from the barrel is present.
The device of claim 1, wherein the fluid
passageway is defined by a cartridge (13, 56) that is detachably

mounted on the barrel
The device of claim 1, wherein the detection
reagent means is located along the side wall of the barrel

outlet
The device of claim 1, 2 or 3, wherein the
test substance is an antigen-specific antibody, and

said detection reagent means includes an antigen
effective to bind specifically to said antibody.
The device of claim 4, wherein said antigen
is reporter-labeled.
The device of claim 1, 2 or 3, wherein the
test substance is a selected antigen, and said 

detection reagent means includes an antigen-specific
antibody.
The device of claim 6, wherein said antigen-specific
antibody is reporter-labeled.
The device of claim 1, 2, or 3, which
further includes a detection unit (60) attachable to said

passageway, wherein the detection unit is adapted to
receive oral fluid expressed from the absorbent pad,

said unit having (i) a solid-support (64, 72, 90, 96) and (ii) a
binding agent attached to the solid-support, where

the binding agent is effective to specifically bind
to and immobilize a test substance in the oral fluid

when the oral fluid is expelled from the barrel into
the unit.
The assembly of claim 8, wherein the test
substance is an antibody that is diagnostic of infection

by a known pathogen, the binding agent is an
antigen that is immunoreactive with such an antibody,

and the assembly further includes a reporter-labeled
reagent effective to bind to the test substance antibody

when the test substance antibody is bound to the
solid-support.
The assembly of claim 9, wherein said
reporter-labeled reagent is located in said fluid

passageway.
The assembly of claim 8, wherein the test
substance is an antibody that is diagnostic of infection

by a known pathogen, the binding agent is effective
to bind human antibodies, and the assembly 

further includes a reporter-labeled antigen that is
immunoreactive with the test substance antibody.
The assembly of claim 11, wherein said
reporter-labeled antigen is located in said fluid

passageway.
The assembly of claim 11, wherein the
binding agent is protein A.
The assembly of claim 11, 12 or 13, wherein
the test substance is an HIV-1 antibody, and the

reporter-labeled reagent is a reporter-labeled HIV-1
peptide.
The assembly of claim 11, 12 or 13, wherein
the test substance is a 
Helicobacter pylor
i antibody,
and the reporter-labeled reagent is a reporter-labeled


Helicobacter pylori
 antigen.
The assembly of claim 8, wherein said
passageway is defined by a cartridge (56) that is detachably

connected to said barrel and detection unit.
The assembly of claim 8 or 16, wherein the
detection reagent means includes a reagent effective

to react with a test substance in the oral fluid to
produce a level of binding of the substance to the

solid-support which is dependent on the concentration
of the test substance in the oral fluid.
The assembly of claim 8, wherein the solid-support
is a permeable membrane and the detection

unit further includes an adsorbent material that can
be brought into contact with the membrane. 
The assembly of claim 8, for assaying
simultaneously for a test substance and a marker

substance in an oral fluid sample, wherein the solid-support
is a membrane comprising:


a first region to which is attached a first
binding agent effective to bind specific
ally to a
test substance in oral fluid;
a second region to which is attached a second
binding agent effective to bind specifically to a

marker substance in such oral fluid, the second
region being at least partially non-overlapping with

the first region;
means for visualizing test substance bound to
said first region; and
means for visualizing marker substance bound to
said second region;

whereby oral fluid containing the marker substance
and not the test substance gives rise to a

pattern on the solid-support surface that is distinguishable
from a pattern that appears for oral fluid

containing both the marker substance and the test
substance.
