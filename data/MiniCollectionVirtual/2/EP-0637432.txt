<ABSTRACT>
The arm (6), at least over a part of its length, is formed as a hose (5) of expandable material, the length expandability of which is different on two opposite sides. The interior of the hose is connected to a pressure source (1) which introduces into it a flowing medium under pressure. The arm in the hose-form area is bendable at least through 180 deg. The holder tool is a thread hook (7) and along the arm a thread channel is arranged formed as a groove in the wall of the arm. The arm (6) is bendable so far that its free end reaches its rearward area. The holder hook (7) is so dimensioned that it can be laid around the rearward area of the arm (6).

<CLAIMS>
A looping instrument comprising an elongate, extensible and 
bendable arm (6) placeable round an object, a holding tool 

being arranged on the free end of the arm (6), characterised in 
that the arm (6) is formed over at least part of its length as a tube 

(5) of extensible material, the linear extensibility of which is different 
on two opposing sides, in that the interior of the tube (5) is 

connected to a pressure source (1) introducing a flowable 
medium under pressure into the tube (5), and in that the arm (6) is 

bendable through at least 180Â° in the region formed as a tube. 
An instrument according to claim 1, characterised in that the 
holding tool is a thread holder (7). 
An instrument according to claim 2, characterised in that the 
thread holder (7) is a hook. 
An instrument according to any one of the preceding claims, 
characterised in that a thread channel (10) is arranged along the 

arm (6). 
An instrument according to claim 4, characterised in that the 
thread channel is arranged inside the arm (6).  

 
An instrument according to claim 4, characterised in that the 
thread channel (10) is formed by a groove or depression in the 

wall of the arm (6). 
An instrument according to any one of the preceding claims, 
characterised in that the arm
 (6) is bendable so far that its free 
end reaches the rear region (11) of the arm (6). 
An instrument according to claim 7, characterised in that the 
holding tool (7) is a hook dimensioned so as to be placeable 

round a rear region (11) of the arm (6). 
An instrument according to claim 8, characterised in that a 
plurality of separately fillable chambers (13, 14, 15) are arranged 

inside the tube (5) of the arm (6) so that it is possible to bend the 
tube (5) in different directions according to the chamber filled.
