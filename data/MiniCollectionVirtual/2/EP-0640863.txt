<ABSTRACT>
A liquid display panel having minute unit liquid crystal cells 
(109), liquid crystalline molecules present in a plane passing the 

thicknesswise middle points of the unit liquid crystal layer and 
parallel to the substrate oriented substantially uniformly at 

random directions and at least one polarization plate, the 
aforementioned liquid crystal is a nematic liquid crystal material 

having a positive permittivity anisotropy, so that a wide viewing 
angle liquid crystal display panel enables high contrast and 

uniform display of a liquid crystal panel without a rubbing 
treatment. The liquid crystal panel is composed of substantially 

round unit liquid crystal cells as viewed from the front of the 
panel surrounded by polymer walls (110) at least on the surface of 

electrode substrates (103, 104).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a liquid display panel and
more particularly to a wide viewing angle liquid crystal display
panel with no necessity of rubbing treatment.Recently, efforts have been made to develop the so-called
active matrix type liquid crystal display panel which has a thin
film transistor as a switching element for each picture element for
obtaining a high quality picture. Compared with the simple matrix
type, this type of liquid crystal display panel has high contrast
ratio regardless of an increasing number of scanning lines and
hence is being rapidly adopted in such fields as pictures for an
engineering work station (EWS) which requires a high capacity and
other fields where high picture brightness is required.Widely used for liquid crystal display panels of the active
matrix type is the TN (twisted nematic) system. This system has
between two opposing substrates a liquid crystal panel of
construction in which liquid crystalline molecules are twisted
vertically 90° by two polarizing plates. The TN system has two
types. One type is the NW (normally white) mode in which the
aforementioned two polarizing axes are perpendicular to each other,
and the direction of the major axis of the liquid crystalline
molecules in the interface of either substrate is parallel or
perpendicular to the polarizing axis of the polarizing plate on the
same side. The second type is the NB (normally black) mode in
which the aforementioned polarizing axes are parallel to each 
other, and the direction of the liquid crystalline molecules is
parallel or perpendicular to the polarizing axes of the polarizing
plates on the same side.With such a liquid crystal display panel a so-called rubbing
treatment was neccessary. A rubbing treatment is a treatment in
which a polymer thin film of e.g. polyimide is formed on a liquid
crystal display panel's substrate and rubbed in a given direction
with nylon, polyester cloth or the like, for equalizing the
orientation direction of liquid crystalline molecules. As a
result, it is possible to obtain a mono-domain allover the panel.Since, however, this rubbing treatment possibly causes
electrostatic destruction, dusting, staining of the film or the
like, a process which does not include a rubbing treatment has been
developed, for example, a process of orienting nematic liquid
crystals by forming micro-groups over a substrate by application of
the photolithograph (Kawada et al.: preliminaries for the 17th
Forum on Liquid Crystals, 2F108).With the widening scope of uses for liquid
