Weighted surface-wave reflector having metallization 
strips (22, 23, 33, 34, 35; 22, 33, 34, 35; 22
, 23, 
33, 35; 122, 132) which are arranged parallel to one 

another and at least one busbar (21), metallization 
strips (22, 34, 35; 22, 34, 54; 22, 35) which are connected 

via the busbar (21) and open metallization strips 
(33; 122, 132) being provided, characterized in that the 

open metallization strips vary in their length in accordance 
with a predetermined weighting function, and 

metallization strips which are connected to the busbar or 
busbars are arranged in the free spaces between open 

metallization strips and the busbar or busbars. 
Weighted surface-wave reflector having metallization 
strips (22, 23, 33, 34, 35; 22, 33, 34, 35; 22, 23, 

33, 35; 122, 132) which are arranged parallel to one 
another and two busbars (21), metallization strips (22, 

34, 35; 22, 34, 54; 22, 35) which are connected via the 
busbars (21) and open metallization strips (33; 122, 132) 

being provided, characterized in that the connected 
metallization strips are interrupted in their 

longitudinal direction, in that the length of the interruption 
is determined by a predetermined weighting 

function, and in that an insulated metallization strip is 
provided in the interruptions.
