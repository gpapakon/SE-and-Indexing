<ABSTRACT>
A bite indicator is described comprising a body (10) to be 
mounted on a fishing rod support, a rigid arm (24) pivotably 

mounted relative to the body (10) and releasably connectable 
at point spaced from the pivot axis to the line of a fishing 

rod resting on the support, and means (26) for resiliently 
applying an adjustable torque to the arm (24) to enable an 

adjustable force to be applied by the arm to the fishing 
line. The means for resiliently applying an adjustable 

torque to the arm (24) comprises a torsion spring (26) 
having one end (32) anchored relative to the body and the 

other end (28) acting on the pivotable arm, the point of 
anchorage of the spring to the body being adjustable to vary 

the tension in the spring (26) and thereby vary the torque 
applied to the arm (24) by the spring (26).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a bite indicator. It is known to suspend a weight from the line of a fishing 
rod, the weight being placed between the tip of the rod and 
the reel about which the line is wound. This weight acts to 
tension the line and movement of this weight also provides a 
first indication that a fish has take the bait at the end of 
the line. Because such a weight can swing in the wind, it is also 
known to replace it by a device commonly referred to as a 
monkey. A monkey comprises of a weight that is guided to 
slide up and down a vertical pole and though it is not 
affected by wind, it suffers from the disadvantage of 
relatively high friction. As an alternative to a monkey, there has been used a 
tensioning arm pivotably mounted on the rod support and 
carrying weights that can slide along the arm to vary the 
line tension. Known devices permit a maximum force of 
typically 25 gm to be applied to the line but this is not 
sufficient on certain occasions, notably when a heavy lead 
is placed on the line near the bait and the bait is cast a 
long distance away from the angler. Such a situation can 
call for a tensioner able to apply a downward force on the 
line of as much as 200 gm and the bulk of a device with this 
number of weights on it would not be acceptable. GB-A-2 260 676 describes a bite indicator which is mounted 
on the rod support and has a flexible spring arm attached by 
a releasable clip to the line of the fishing rod. It is  
 
difficult with such a construction to adjust the line 
tension within a wide range. Furthermore, there is a 
minimum tension applied to the line by the line clip which 
can in some cases be excessive. GB-A-2 080 081 and US-A-4 471 555 describe bite indicators 
that are mounted on the rods. Because the indicators on 
mounted on the rods, they move with the fishing line and 
they need not be releasable from the line. Rod mounted 
indicators are however undesirable in that they are 
cumbersome and they affect the handling of the rods. They 
are also difficult to transfer from one rod to another. GB-A-2 052 933 and GB-A-1 168 142 show indicators that bias 
the line upwards rather downwards and are mounted forward of 
the tip of the fishing rod. Such indicators do not interfere 
with the raising of the rod off its support when a bite is 
detected but they are undesirable because they are prone to 
false alarms. In windy conditions, the tip of the rod and 
the line itself can move extensively. A further disadvantage 
of such an indicator is that

<CLAIMS>
A bite indicator comprising a body (10) to be mounted 
on a fishing rod support, a rigid arm (24) pivotably mounted 

relative to the body (10) and releasably connectable at 
point spaced from the pivot axis to the line of a fishing 

rod resting on the support, and means (26) for resiliently 
applying an adjustable torque to the arm (24) to enable an 

adjustable force to be applied by the arm to the fishing 
line, characterised in that the means for resiliently 

applying an adjustable torque to the arm (24) comprises a 
torsion spring (26) having one end (32) anchored relative to 

the body and the other end (28) acting on the pivotable arm, 
the point of anchorage of the spring to the body being 

adjustable to vary the tension in the spring (26) and 
thereby vary the torque applied to the arm (24) by the 

spring (26). 
A bite indicator as claimed in claim 1, wherein the arm 
(24) is connected to a rotor (18) rotatably mounted within 

the body (10) and a control knob (34) is mounted on the body 
(10) for rotation about the same axis as the rotor (18) 

relative to the body (10), the torsion spring acting between 
the control knob (34) and the rotor (18) so that rotation of 

the control knob serves to vary the tension in the coil 
spring (26), and a releasable ratchet mechanism (44,46,48) 

being provided between the control knob (34) and the body 
(10) to resist rotation of the control knob (34) under the 

reaction of the coil spring (26). 
A bite indicator as claimed in claim 3, wherein the 
ratchet mechanism is reversible.
