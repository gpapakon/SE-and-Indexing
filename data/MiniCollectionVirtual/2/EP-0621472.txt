<ABSTRACT>
Leakage of water from a boiler water system wherein steam is generated in a boiler from 
feedwater fed to the boiler, and the concentration of impurities in the boiler water within the 

boiler is reduced by withdrawing fractions thereof as blowdown while admitting additional 
feedwater as boiler-water makeup, is determined. The boiler has a concentration cycle value, the 

concentration cycle value being the average value of the concentration of an inert component in 
the blowdown at steady state (C
F
) divided by the concentration of the inert component in the 
feedwater (C
I
). The concentration of the inert component in the boiler at steady state varies 
from a high concentration C
H
, having a value that is higher than C
F
, to a low concentration C
L
, 
having a value between the (C
I
) and the (C
F
), within a time period. The method comprises:
 

   employing as the inert component an inert tracer;
 

   sensing a characteristic of the inert tracer in the boiler at steady state equivalent to its 
concentration in the boiler water;

 
   converting the sensed characteristic to a value equivalent to the concentration of the inert 

tracer in the boiler water; and
 

   activation of a signal when a variance in the cyclic concentration fluctuation of said inert 
tracer occurs that is consistent with a leakage of boiler water.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention is in the technical field of boiler maintenance, and in particular the
detection of leakage in a boiler system.A boiler is a vessel in which water is vaporized into steam by the application of heat,
typically on a continuous basis. The steam generated is most often used either as a direct or
indirect heat transfer medium and/or to generate electric power. High pressure and/or high
capacity boilers generally are water-tube boilers in which water is circulated within tubes and the
applied heat (combustion products such as flame and hot combustion gases) flows across the
outside of the tubes. Some of these water tubes may comprise the walls of the furnace in which
the heat-generating combustion occurs.Most water tubes are in the boiler furnace and therefore leakage in a boiler system can be
a very grave matter. For instance, the serious risk of smelt/water explosions caused by leakage
in recovery boilers is well recognized in the pulp and paper industry, and industry-wide
efforts
seeking ways to reduce the risk are on-going. Such goal is of significant interest to recovery
boiler manufacturers, insurers and pulp mills which operate recovery boilers which burn organic
liquors having high caustic levels. Explosions caused by leakage is not a concern for power 
boilers which burn oil or natural gas, because leaking water will just flash to steam, but
nonetheless leakage decreases boiler operation efficiency and increases boiler maintenance costs,
and thus leak detection is desirable. A primary leakage concern for boilers in the chemical
process industry is contamination of process streams, for instance in ammonia production plants
having an ammonia stream on one side of the boiler wall. The nuclear power generation
industry has a serious need to avoid boiler-water leakage because fluids with a high radioactive
contamination level are under high pressure and a leakage could spread such contamination
outside of the initial containment.Many technologies have been and are currently being developed for detecting boiler
water leaks, particularly furnace-water-wall leaks, at the earliest possible moment. These
technologies include the use of steam drum level control, computer algorithm, and others.
Among the recently developed technologies for early leak detection is the use of sodium ion
concentration to detect tube leaks (balancing the sodium ion mass between the boiler feedwater
and blowdown), but the sensitivity of the sodium-specific electrode is affected by pH among
other feedwater
