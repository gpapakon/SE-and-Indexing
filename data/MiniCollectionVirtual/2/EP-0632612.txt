<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an error
detection method which uses a convolutional code as an
error correction code and a Viterbi decoding as its
decoding in digital data transmission or the like.Viterbi decoding is one of convolutional
code methods. The Viterbi decoding will be explained
in connection with a specific example of a convolutional
code C with a constraint length K=3 and a
coding rate R=1/2 generated by such a convolutional
encoder circuit 30 as shown in Fig. 1.The convolutional encoder 30 comprises an
input terminal 40, a first shift register F0 as a first
delay operator, a second shift register F1 as a second
delay operator, a first adder 42, a second adder 44, a
first output terminal 46, and a second output terminal
48. Applied to the input terminal 40 is a train of
information signals bi, b(i+1),... The first shift
register F0 receives the information signal train from
the input terminal and outputs the information signal
train delayed by a unit time. The second shift register
F1 receives an output signal of the first shift
register F0 and outputs the signal further delayed by a 
unit time. Further, the first adder 42 adds together
outputs of the input terminal 40, first shift register
F0 and second shift register F1 and outputs its added
result from the first output terminal 46 as a first
output ci(1)=b(i-2)+b(i-1)+bi. The second adder 44 adds
together the input signal from the input terminal 40
and the output of the second shift register F1 and
outputs a second output ci(2)=b(i-2)+bi from the second
output terminal 48.The status S of the convolutional encoder 30
falls in one of the following four statuses depending
on the states of the shift registers F0 and F1 shown in
Fig. 1.
   S0=(0,0), S1=(1,0), S2=(0,1) and S3=(1,1)Trellis chart refers to representation of
transition statuses of a convolutional encoder circuit
varying from the initial status SO at every moment when
an information signal is input. The trellis chart of
the aforementioned code C is shown in Fig. 2. In this
connection, it is assumed that the input information
signal train has a length of J-K+1 followed by (K-1) of
Os for its information termination. In the trellis
chart, in addition, branch-like part is called merely a
"branch" while a connection of more than one branch
connected in series is called a "partial path".In the trellis chart of Fig. 2, nodes in the
first row are marked by S0, nodes in the second row
by S1, nodes in the third row by S2, nodes in the 
fourth row by S3. The respective nodes or encoders
