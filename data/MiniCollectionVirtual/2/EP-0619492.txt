Method for the determination of an analyte in a
sample liquid by a reaction proceeding in several

steps which are separated from one another in time,
wherein

the sample liquid containing the analyte is added
to a reaction vessel which contains at least two

reagents required to carry out the determination
reaction in a form which is readily soluble in the

sample liquid and spatially separated from one
another wherein a first reagent intended for the

first reaction step is in a form which is soluble
without delay in the sample liquid while a second

reagent intended for the second reaction step and
optionally further reagents are separated from one

another and from the first reagent and are
protected from an immediate contact with the sample

liquid by protective layers wherein the protective
layers are designed in such a way that they enable

delayed contact between the sample liquid
containing the analyte and the reagent located

under the respective protective layer so that a
reaction of the analyte with the reagents can take

place in several steps which are separated from one
another in time and so that the analyte can be

determined after completion of the reaction in a
homogeneous liquid phase.
Method as claimed in claim 1,
wherein

the protective layers are designed in such a way
that they can be made permeable to the sample 

liquid by the action of the sample liquid or/and by
the action of external physical-chemical agents.
Method as claimed in claim 2,
wherein

the protective layers contain a water-soluble
polymer.
Method as claimed in claim 2,
wherein

the action of external physical-chemical agents
includes the application of heat or/and radiation.
Method as claimed in claim 4,
wherein

the protective layers contain a photolabile or/and
thermolabile polymer.
Method as claimed in claim 5,
wherein

the polymer is a triazene or a pentazadiene
polymer.
Method as claimed in one of the claims 2 to 6,
wherein

the protective layers can be made permeable to the
sample liquid by an at least partial dissolution.
Method as claimed in one of the claims 1 - 7,
wherein

the sample liquid, after addition to the reaction
vessel, is mixed with a mixing agent until the

first reagent is intimately mixed with the sample, 
the mixing agent is switched off until the time at

which a release of the second reagent is desired,
the mixing agent is switched on again until the

second reagent has been adequately mixed and if
desired the procedure is carried out analogously

for further reagents.
Method as claimed in one of the claims 3 and 5
or 6,
wherein

the polymer forming the protective layers is
applied from an organic solution in which the

reagents located under it are themselves not
soluble.
Reaction vessel for the determination of an analyte
present in a sample liquid by a reaction proceeding

in several steps which are separated from one
another in time,
wherein

it contains at least two reagents required to carry
out the determination reaction that are in a form

which is readily soluble in the sample liquid and
are spatially separated from one another, wherein a

first reagent intended for the first reaction step
is in a form which is soluble without delay in the

sample liquid, while a second reagent intended for
the second reaction step and optionally f
urther
reagents are separated from one another and from

the first reagent and are protected from an
immediate contact with the sample liquid by

protective layers wherein the protective layers are
designed in such a way that they enable a delayed

contact between the sample liquid containing the
analyte and the reagent located under the 

respective protective layer so that a reaction of
the analyte with the reagents can take place in

several steps which are separated from one another
in time.
Reaction vessel as claimed in claim 10,
wherein

the protective layers are designed in such a way
that they can be made permeable to the sample

liquid by the action of the sample liquid or/and by
the action of external physical-chemical agents.
Reaction vessel as claimed in claim 11,
wherein

the protective layers contain a water-soluble
polymer.
Reaction vessel as claimed in claim 11,
wherein

the action of external physical-chemical agents
includes the application of heat or/and radiation.
Reaction vessel as claimed in claim 13,
wherein

the protective layers contain a photolabile or/and
thermolabile polymer.
Reaction vessel as claimed in claim 14,
wherein

the polymer is a triazene or a pentazadiene
polymer. 
Reaction vessel as claimed in one of the claims 10
to 15,
wherein

the protective layers can be made permeable to the
sample liquid by an at least partial dissolution.
