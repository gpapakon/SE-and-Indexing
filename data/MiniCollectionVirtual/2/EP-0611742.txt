<ABSTRACT>
A kitchen garbage disposal system wherein kitchen 
garbage (organic wastes) generated in a kitchen is put into 

a kitchen garbage discharge port opening indoors and is charged 
through a discharge passage into a process vessel installed 

outdoors which contains a medium to cultivate aschelminsaids 
such as philodina and diplogaster and micro-organisms such 

as protozoa and bacteria, wherein the medium and the charged 
kitchen garbage are mixed by a mixer screw installed in the 

process vessel, thereby to decompose the kitchen garbage 
into inorganic materials (carbon dioxide, water) by means of 

the activities of aschelminthes and micro-organisms.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a kitchen garbage 
disposal system to dispose of kitchen garbage consisting of 
kitchen garbage (food garbage) generated in a kitchen, by 
means of the decomposing action of aschelminthes such as 
philodina and diplogaster, and micro-organisms such as 
protozoa and bacteria. One of the methods to dispose of kitchen garbage 
generated every day in the kitchens of homes and eating 
establishments utilizes the decomposing actions of micro-organisms. 
This method has been viewed as a promising 
technology because it helps reduce the volume of wastes and 
contributes to the reduction of processing load on the waste 
incineration facilities and sewage treatment plants, and is 
also favorable in the aspect of environment conservation. As a kitchen garbage disposal apparatus, the compost 
vessel has long been known. It is a cylindrical vessel 
having a lid covering an opening on one side, and is 
partially embedded to an appropriate depth in the ground 
with another opening on the other side facing downward.  
 
After charging kitchen garbage into the vessel by opening 
the lid, the vessel is left to stand with the lid being 
closed, so that the micro-organisms reproducing in the soil 
decompose the kitchen garbage into compost. However, progress of decomposing the kitchen garbage in 
the compost vessel is moderate and therefore the rate of 
composting is slow, thus the small processing capacity 
limits the applicability of the compost vessel. Also the 
compost vessel requires the existence of soil wherein it is 
embedded, and a larger processing capacity requires a vessel 
of greater volume. It also has a problem of foul odor 
generated in the process of decomposition leaking into the 
environment, which makes it unsuitable to the application in 
urban areas crowded with collective residential buildings. 
When used in an urban area, it also has a problem that the 
compost produced through the decomposition process is 
difficult to dispose of. A method of grinding and dewatering kitchen garbage and 
automatically packing it in waste bags which are thereafter 
dumped has been proposed, for example, in the Japanese 
Patent Application Laid-Open No.4-156959 (1992). However, 
this method requires the disposal of the waste bags 
containing the kitchen garbage, resulting in the trouble of 
dumping operation and a problem in view of environment 
conservation.
