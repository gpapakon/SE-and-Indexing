<ABSTRACT>
A lock assembly fittable to a door wing and 
composed of a lock (1) presenting a spring latch (6), a 

tilting bolt (5), and rods (17, 18) controlling ties for 
operating two tilting bolts (5a, 5b) below and above the 

lock (1); and of a panic handle (71) presenting a plate 
(86) which fits inside an opening (67) in an appendix 

(66) of a plate (55), and, when moved, withdraws the 
spring latch (6) and the bolts (5, 5a, 5b) to release 

the lock (1).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a lock assembly
comprising a lock and panic handle, and fittable to a
door or similar.The state of the art is already familiar with
assemblies featuring a panic handle and a spring latch
lock.A major drawback of such assemblies, however, is
the lack of security provided for, due to the ease with
which the lock may be forced.In most panic handle applications, therefore, the
door is fitted with a lock assembly comprising a first
lock with a spring latch only and operated by the panic
handle, and a second lock with a bolt. The French patent application FR-A- 2 581 692 (EMERY)
illustrates the preamble portion of the present claim 1.
In particular, this document illustrates a lock assembly
comprising:
a lock featuring at least a first bolt movable between a
withdrawn and an extended position; a slide connected to
the first bolt and movable by key-operated activating
means, for moving the first bolt between the withdrawn and
the extended position; and a spring latch movable by
handle-operated activating means between an extended
position, normally maintained by elastic means, and a
withdrawn position; anda panic handle linked to the spring latch,
and movable between an idle position and an
operating position wherein the spring latch is released.
The known lock assembly also comprises means for
controlling the slide and operated by the panic handle, for
moving the first bolt from the extended position to the
withdrawn position when the panic handle is moved from the
idle position to the operating position.A drawback of the known lock assembly is that
assembly of the combined panic handle and lock case is quite
complicated.It is an object of the present invention to provide a
lock assembly operable by a panic handle, adequately
resistant to forcing, and designed to overcome the
aforementioned drawbacks typically 
associated with known lock assemblies.According to the present invention, there is
provided a lock assembly as defined in claim 1.Particular embodiments are defined in the dependent claims.A preferred non-limiting embodiment of the present
invention will be described by way of example with
reference to the accompanying drawings, in which:
Figure 1 shows a front view, with first parts
removed for clarity, of a lock in the closed position
and forming part of a lock assembly in accordance with
the present invention;Figure 2 shows a front view, with first parts 
removed for clarity, of the Figure 1 lock in the open
position;Figure 3 shows a front view, with second parts

<CLAIMS>
A lock assembly comprising:

a lock (1) featuring at least one first bolt (5) movable between a withdrawn and an
extended position; a slide (7) connected to said at least one first bolt (5) and movable

by key-operated activating means, for moving said at least one first bolt (5) between
said withdrawn and said extended position; and a spring latch (6) movable by handle-operated

activating means between an extended position, normally maintained by
elastic means, and a withdrawn position; and
a panic handle (71) linked to said spring latch (6), and movable between an idle
position and an operating position wherein said spring latch (6) is released;

lock assembly characterised in that it comprises an activating mechanism controlled by
said panic handle (71), said activating mechanism comprising an activating element

(86) in inserted engagement, upon said panic handle (71) being mounted together with
said lock (1), with an opening (67) provided on a sliding plate (55) and

displaceable upon operation of said panic handle (71), so as to cause through said
engagement said sliding plate (55) to slide, said sliding plate (55) being operatively

linked to said spring latch (6) and to said at least one first bolt (5).
A lock assembly as claimed in Claim 1, wherein it further comprises at least
one second bolt (5a, 5b) connected to said at least one first bolt (5) of said lock (1) by

means of longitudinally-sliding transmission rods (17, 18).
A lock assembly as claimed in Claim 2, wherein said sliding plate (55) is
further operatively linked to said at least one second bolt (5a, 5b) connected to said at

least one first bolt (5) of said lock (1) by means of longitudinally-sliding transmission
rods (17, 18).
A lock assembly as claimed in Claim 1 or in Claim 2, wherein said means for
activating said spring latch (6) comprise a first lever (39) linked to said spring latch (6)

and having a second pin (48) cooperating with said plate (55).
A lock assembly as claimed in Claim 1 or in Claim 2, wherein said plate (55)
presents an inclined edge (64) cooperating with said second pin (48).
A lock assembly as claimed in Claim 1 or in Claim 2, wherein said means for
activating said spring latch (6) comprise a pin (28) connected prismatically to an

external handle; said first lever (39) being fitted in angularly idle manner to said pin
(28).
A lock assembly as claimed in Claim 6, wherein said means for activating
said spring latch (6) comprise a second lever (40) linked to said spring latch (6) and

connected prismatically to said pin (28). 
A lock assembly as claimed in one of the foregoing Claims, wherein said at
least one first bolt (5) is a tilting bolt.
A lock assembly as claimed in one of the foregoing Claims, wherein said
activating mechanism comprises means for guiding said activating element (86); and

cam means integral with said panic handle (71) and cooperating with said activating
element (86), for converting rotation of said panic handle into linear movement of said

activating element (86).
