<ABSTRACT>
A display system (10) for a vehicle having a display panel 
mounted within view of an operator's position comprises a first 

image source (54) mounted in said vehicle for providing a first 
image display, a narrow band optical element (58) disposed 

between said first image source (54) and said operator's position 
for creating a first color virtual image (50) of said first 

image display (54) at a first spatial location (44) visible 
from said operator's position, and a second image source (120) 

for providing a second image display outside the bandwidth of 
said narrow band optical element (58). The second image source 

(120) is positioned relative to said narrow band optical element 
(58) to produce a second color image at a second spatial location

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates generally to optical 
display systems and, more particularly, has reference to 
a new and improved system for displaying indicia in an 
automobile. General production line automobiles typically 
have a plurality of instruments, indicators and gauges 
displayed on a dashboard panel behind the steering wheel. 
These instruments usually include a speedometer, a 
tachometer, a clock, an odometer, and a trip odometer, 
various auxiliary gauges for oil pressure, engine 
temperature, fuel level and battery charge, and a 
collection of system warning lights. In older cars, the 
instruments are often electro-mechanical devices with 
moving needle indicators. Newer models frequently use 
backlit direct view liquid crystal displays or self-illuminating 
vacuum fluorescent displays. The 
instruments are typically arranged in a planar cluster 
and thus appear to be equidistant from the driver's eyes. Due to the limited space available in the 
interior of an automobile, the instrument panel is 
usually located relatively close (e.g., about two feet) 
to the driver's eyes. To read direct view instruments, 
the driver refocuses his eyes from the far range viewing 
(essentially at infinity) used to observe the road ahead 
to the near range viewing used to look at the 
instruments. While such systems generally have served 
their purposes, there remains a continuing desire for 
further improvements, particularly in the areas of 
instrument readability and reduced driver eye strain. One foreign automobile manufacturer attempted 
to provide an improved instrument display having a 
viewing distance slightly beyond the normal dashboard  
 
panel position by mounting a transreflective flat folding 
mirror on the dashboard below a full-size vacuum 
fluorescent instrument display. Warning lamps were 
positioned behind the mirror in an attempt to create the 
effect of a 3-D image. This approach was unsatisfactory 
in several respects and left considerable room for 
improvement. A need exists for an automobile instrument 
display system which minimizes driver eye strain and 
enhances instrument readability, particularly for older 
persons and persons who are far sighted or wear bifocals, 
by producing an instrument cluster image which is located 
well beyond (e.g., about one foot or more) the face of 
the dashboard and a considerable distance (e.g., about 
four feet or more) from the driver's normal viewing 
position and by producing an instrument cluster image 
which creates a dramatic visual impact in the
