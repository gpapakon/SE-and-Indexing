<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a muscle-operated vehicle, in particular pedal operated vehicle 
such as a bicycle, having a muscle-operated driving system and an auxiliary electrical 
power driving system, sensor means for detecting the vehicle speed and the human 
driving power for driving the vehicle and a control means for controlling the activation 
and/or the output of the electrical power driving system according to changes of the 
human driving power. It has been proposed to provide a manually powered vehicle with an electric assist so as 
to assist the occupant in the manual propulsion of the vehicle. For example, the 
European patent applications 0 517 224 and 0 569 954 on which the preamble of claim 1 is based, show a manually powered 
vehicle such as a bicycle as indicated above, wherein there is provided an electric power 
assist for assisting the occupant in the powering of the vehicle. This type of mechanism 
includes an arrangement that senses the manual input force or torque exerted by the 
occupant and then powers an electric motor by connecting it to a battery in such a way 
so as to provide a degree of assist in proportion to the manual input force. This type of vehicle has a large number of advantages. However, it 
is important to ensure that the amount of electrical power supplied 
to the electric motor cannot be too great under certain 
circumstances so as to permit the speed of the vehicle to become 
excessive. In addition, it should be ensured that the system will 
not permit the operator to bypass the control and operate the 
electric motor manually which might also result in excessive speed 
of the vehicle. The afore-noted copending applications disclose a 
number of ways in which these effects can be obtained. In all of the systems disclosed in the afore-noted copending 
application, the control senses only abnormal variations in the 
force sensed and provides safety disconnect of the electric motor 
power in the event the force sensor becomes inoperative or is 
bypassed. Although this has a number of advantages, further 
improvements or alternative constructions may be desirable.  
 More specifially, from the afore-indicated arrangements it is known 
to detect the vehicle speed in addition to the pedal force so that 
an appropriate driving force of the electric motor is determined 
from both of the detected parameters. In an example of such an 
arrangement, the motor output and, therefore, the electric assist of 
the operator is limited when the vehicle speed exceeds a 
predetermin
