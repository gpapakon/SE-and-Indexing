<ABSTRACT>
At least two optical fiber elements, each having a protective layer thereon, are arranged on the same plane 
in parallel at least as one pair. At least one pair of optical fiber elements is covered with at least one common 

covering layer. This common covering layer contains a main component of common covering resin, and a component 
incompatible with the main component. Not only the coefficient of the friction between the common covering layer 

and the elements, but also the coefficients of the friction between the elements themselves are small. Thus no bending 
distortion occurs.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a tape form optical fiber 
wire. In particular, the present invention relates to a tape form 
optical fiber wire for fabricating a high density cable to be used as a 
telecommunication optical fiber cable. In these years, with the expansion of optical communication 
networks, requirements for a higher density of an optical 
fiber cable are increasing to increase a transmission capacity. 
Demands for tape form optical fiber wires in which plural optical 
fibers are arranged in parallel and coated together are increasing, 
since they can achieve the high density easily by laminating them. 
Multi-coring of the tape form optical fiber wire has been studied in 
various ways. To make its handling easy, a tape form optical fiber 
wire which can be easily split to several wires is known from, for 
example, Japanese Patent KOKAI Publication No. 150106/1989 and 
138519/1989. With such optical fiber wire, it is easy to increase the 
density, while the wire has a problem that the optical fiber is 
strained when an optical fiber unit having a laminated structure is 
bent. This is because free movement of a common coating layer and 
the optical fibers is limited, so that local flexural strain is generated. 
To solve such problem, it is known to provide a cushioning 
layer between the optical fiber and its protective layer as disclosed 
in Japanese Patent KOKAI Publication No. 134211/1985, or it is 
known to assemble the common coating layer and the protective  
 
layer of the optical fiber or to coat or supply a material for reducing 
a coefficient of friction between the common coating layer and the 
protective layer, so as to reduce friction between them and make 
slipping easy between them. However, with the increase of the number of the core optical 
fibers, a coefficient of friction between the tape form optical 
fiber wires becomes important. Japanese Patent KOKAI Publication 
No. 89915/1987 proposes the provision of a layer for reducing a 
coefficient of friction made of a material having a small coefficient 
of friction such as polytetrafluoroethylene, nylon, and the like. 
Japanese Patent KOKAI Publication No. 98314/1987 proposes the 
supply of a powder having a very small particle size such as talc, 
talcum powder, water-absorbing powder and the like between the 
layers. However, since all the proposals require an extra work in 
addition to the formation of the common coating layer, they have 
decreased workability and productivity. An object of the present invention is to
