<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a fluorenone
derivative, a process for preparing the same and a central or
peripheral nerve degeneration repair or protective agent.At present, it is suggested that senile dementia
represented by Alzheimer's disease causes serious change in
central cholinergic nervous system, which results in
deterioration of function thereof [Perry, E. K. and
Perry, R. H. "Biochemistry of Dementia", page 135 (1980), John
Wiley & Sons.,].Accordingly, a compound having repair capacity (e.g.
survival effect and neulite stretching effect) and protective
action of nerve cells can be effectively used as a remedy or a
preventive for senile dementia represented by
Alzheimer's disease, Down's syndrome, Huntington's chorea,
intellectual/learning disturbance (e.g. amnesia, memory
disorder, etc.), and aftereffect and neuropathy caused by
deterioration of acetylcholinergic nervous system function due
to head injury, cerebral operation, drug intoxication,
circulatory disorder, cerebral metabolic disorder, 
encephalitis, etc. [J. W. Geddes et al., Science, 230, 1179-1181
(1985)].Heretofore, NGF (nerve growth factor), GM1
(ganglioside) and the like have merely been known as the
compound having repair capacity for nerve cells degeneration
as described above. NGF is described, for example, in
Neuroscience [Hefti, F. et al., 14, 55-68 (1985)], Journal of
Neuroscience [Frantz Hefti, 6, 2155-2162 (1986)], Proc. Natl.
Acad. Sci. USA, L. R. Williams et al., 83, 9231-9235 (1986)],
Science [L. E. Kromer, 235, 214-216 (1986)] and the like. In
addition, GM1 is described, for example, in Science [Fred J.
Roisen et al., 214, 577-578 (1981)], Brain Res. [M. V.
Sofroniew et al. 398, 393-396 (1986)], Brain Res. [M.
Gradkowska et al., 375, 417-422 (1986)] and the like.A fluorenone derivative of the present invention is
represented by the following formula (C). 

[wherein R1a, R2a, Ra, Rh, s and r are as defined in claim 1. The central and/or peripheral nerve cells degeneration
repair or protective agent of the present invention is contained in a
fluorenone derivative represented by the formula:

[wherein R1 is a hydrogen atom, a hydroxyl group, a lower
alkenyl group, a lower alkyl group, a halogen atom, a lower
alkoxy group, a lower alkylthio group, a lower alkanoyloxy
