<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a method of preparing a
radiolabelled technetium complex by bringing Tc-99m in the form
of a pertechnetate solution in a complex-forming reaction with
a compound of the general formula
whereinR1, R2 and R3 each independently represents a hydrogen
atom, a methyl group, a carboxy group or a carboxymethyl
group;
A represents an amino group or a mercapto group; and
B represents a group of the general formula NH-Z-COOH,
wherein Z is a C1-C4 alkylene or alkylidene group;Such a complex-forming reaction as defined above,
starting, however, from a compound of formula I wherein
optionally mercapto groups are protected, is described in
European patent application publ. no. 173424. According to this
patent publication, Tc-99m mercaptoacetyl-triglycine is
prepared by heating a mixture of benzoyl
mercaptoacetyltriglycine, an exchange ligand, a Sn(II) salt as
a reducing agent and a Tc-99m pertechnetate solution in a
boiling water bath for five minutes. According to European
patent application, publ. no. 250013, related compounds like
Tc-99m mercaptoacetyl-glycylserylglycine are prepared in a
corresponding manner, viz. by heating the S-benzoyl mercapto 
compound together with a Sn(II) salt, Tc-99m pertechnetate and
a buffer solution (pH 5.0) in a boiling water bath for 10
minutes. According to this latter European patent publication
such technetium-99m complexes can also be prepared starting
from the corresponding ethyl ester, viz. by heating said ester
in a boiling water bath in the presence of sodium dithionite as
a reducing agent in the presence of a base, apparently to
saponify the ester to the corresponding acid.
As a matter of fact, however, Sn(II) salts are preferred to
dithionite as reducing agent in the labelling reaction with Tc-99m
pertechnetate, because dithionite is not sufficiently
stable under the normal storage conditions and therefore less
attractive for pharmaceutical purposes.
A complex-forming reaction for a compound comparable to the
compound of formula (I), viz. the synthesis of Tc-99m N,N'-bis(mercaptoacetyl)-2,3-diaminopropanoate
with the aid of
different reducing agents, including dithionite and Sn(II)
salts, is described by Fritzberg et al. (J. Nucl. Med. 1982, 23,
592-98). The method with Sn(II) salts can be performed at room
temperature but has, however, the disadvantage of a low yield
when performed at room temperature; a higher yield can only be
otained by heating to 95Â°C for 15 minutes.In various respects the reaction conditions for the
preparation of the
