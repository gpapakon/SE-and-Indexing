<ABSTRACT>
A surgical device enabling lamellar cutting of the cornea to be carried out, comprising a ring-shaped base (1) adapted in such a way that it can be applied to and maintained on the eye, a cutting tool comprising a cutting blade accommodated in a support (4) cooperating with the base (1) in order to guide the displacement of the fine edge of the blade on plane that is parallel to the ring and comprising an adaptation element (10) disposed at the front of the blade for the part of the cornea that protrudes inside the ring. The invention is characterized in that the adaptation element is made of a roller (10) that is coupled to a support for the blade around an axis of rotation that is perpendicular to the cut.

A surgical instrument for lamellal cutting of the
cornea, the instrument comprising:


a ring-shaped base (1) shaped for being applied to
and held against the eye; and
a cutting tool having a cutting blade received in
a support (4) co-operating with the base (1) to guide

displacement of the cutting edge of the blade in a plane
parallel to the ring, and including, in front of the

blade, a shaping element (10) for shaping the portion of
the cornea that projects into the ring;

   the instrument being 
characterized in that
 the
shaping element is constituted by a roller (10) coupled

to the blade support about an axis of rotation
perpendicular to the cutting direction.
An instrument according to claim 1, 
characterized in
that
 the roller is cylindrical.
An instrument according to claim 1, 
characterized in
that
 the roller is barrel-shaped.
An instrument according to claim 1, 
characterized in
that
 the roller is diabolo-shaped.
An instrument according to any preceding claim,

characterized in that
 the roller (16) is cylindrical and
possesses a lens (17) fitted to project from its outer

surface.
An instrument according to any one of claims 1 to 4,

characterized in that
 the roller (12) is cylindrical and
possesses a lens-shaped recess (13) in its outer surface.
An instrument according to claim 5 or claim 6,

characterized in that
 the roller includes an index A
associated with the position of a particular generator 

line of its peripheral surface, and 
in that
 the support 4
includes a mark B for locating the index in a determined

position.
An instrument according to any preceding claim,

characterized in that
 the peripheral surface of the
shaper member is provided with microrelief (11) to

enhance rolling without slip on the surface of the
cornea.
An instrument according to any preceding claim,

characterized in that
 it includes a cornea-pre-compressing
plate (23) in front of the roller (10).
An instrument according to claim 9, 
characterized in
that
 the plate (23) is transparent and includes
graduations forming a template for inspecting the cornea.
An instrument according to any preceding claim,

characterized in that
 the annular base (1) has a groove
(5) in its face directed towards the eye, the groove (5)

being partitioned by an intermediate wall (21) provided
with at least one opening (22) providing communication

between the two portions of the groove (5).
