<ABSTRACT>
A squeeze roller assembly made up of a plurality of 
pairs of squeeze rollers (11,12,13) are arranged in a row over a 

plurality of rows of photographic developing tanks (2) for 
delivering photosensitive materials between the adjacent 

developing tanks (2). One of each pair of squeeze rollers (11-13) is 
formed in its outer peripheral surface with an annular 

groove (14,15,16) for preventing correction values printed on a base 
surface of a photosensitive material from being transferred 

to the rollers. Each annular groove (14-16) has a width different 
from the widths of the other annular grooves.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to squeeze rollers for use in 
a photosensitive material developing apparatus and more 
particularly to squeeze rollers for removing treating 
solutions from photographic paper while it is fed through a 
printing/developing apparatus. A printed photosensitive material is dipped in each 
of the treating tanks in a printing/developing apparatus 
which are arranged in a row, raised out of it and sent to 
the next treating tank. During its travel from one treating tank to the next 
one, it passes between a plurality of pairs of squeeze 
rollers arranged over the adjacent treating tanks. The 
squeeze rollers serve to squeeze the paper and remove any 
treating solution stuck on it. Thus, before the paper is 
fed into the next tank, treating solutions are completely 
removed from the paper, so that the solution in one tank 
will never mix with the solution in the next tank. The squeeze rollers, which are essential components 
for a printing/developing apparatus for photosensitive 
materials, have one problem in that correction values 
printed on the base surface (back) of a photosensitive 
material, which indicate important data for the subsequent 
treating such as finish printing and re-printing, may be  
 
transferred to the squeeze rollers. Thus, it is an ordinary practice to provide one of 
each pair of squeeze rollers which is opposite to the base 
surface of a photosensitive material with an annular groove 
to prevent the rollers from coming into contact with the 
correction values printed on the base surface. Any treating solution stuck on such rollers tend to 
crystallize along the edges of the annular grooves. While 
no photosensitive material is fed between each pair of 
squeeze rollers, the treating solution that have 
crystallized on one roller with the annular groove will be 
transferred to the other roller, which has no annular 
groove and is adapted to be brought into contact with the 
emulsion surface of a photosensitive material, thereby 
leaving two annular lines of crystallized treating solution 
on the other roller. Such crystallized solution stuck on 
the other roller may cause increased irregularity in 
sensitization of the emulsion surface of a photosensitive 
material or produce scratches thereon. Such phenomena occur because the annular grooves 
formed in those of the plurality of squeeze rollers that 
are brought into contact with the base surface of a 
photosensitive material are not only located at the same 
position with respect to the photosensitive material

<CLAIMS>
A squeeze roller assembly for use in a photosensitive 
material developing apparatus, comprising a plurality of 

pairs of squeeze rollers (11, 12, 13) over a plurality of treating tanks (2) 
for removing treating solution (3) from photosensitive 

materials (20), one roller of said each pair of squeeze rollers being 
formed in outer peripheral surface thereof with an annular 

groove (14, 15, 16) for preventing correction values printed on the base 
surface (22) of a photosensitive material from being transferred 

to the other of said each pair of squeeze rollers, characterized in that said 
each annular groove has a width different from the 

widths of the other annular grooves. 
A squeeze roller assembly as claimed in claim 1, characterized 
in that the annular groove formed in one of the pair of 

squeeze rollers located at the foremost with respect to the 
feed direction of photosensitive materials is the narrowest 

of all the annular grooves. 
A squeeze roller assembly as claimed in claim 1, characterized 
in that the widths of said annular grooves decrease from 

rear to front with respect to the feed direction of 
photosensitive materials.  

 
A squeeze roller assembly as claimed in claim 1, characterized 
in that said each annular groove has its edges on both 

sides rounded off with a predetermined radius of curvature (17).
