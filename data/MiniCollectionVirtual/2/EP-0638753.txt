<ABSTRACT>
A ball valve coupling includes a pair of 
identical ball valve units (12) adapted for mounting onto 

a respective pair of fluid flow conduits (14,16), such as 
fuel hoses in a fuel handling environment. The two 

ball valve units are releasibly connected in in-line, 
face-to-face relation by interengageable lock lugs (48), 

and further include individual ball valves (20) rotatable 
between open and closed positions to control fluid 

flow therethrough. Each ball valve unit includes a 
safety lock-out key (22) engaged by a lock lug on the 

other ball valve unit as the coupling is assembled, 
wherein the lock-out key precludes ball valve 

rotation to the open position unless the two ball 
valve units are fully and properly engaged in sealed 

relation. The lock-out key of each ball valve unit 
further precludes coupling disassembly unless the 

ball valve is first returned to the closed position. 
In addition, a telescopic valve handle (18) on each ball 

valve unit is spring-loaded to a normal compact 
collapsed position with a stop pin (86) oriented for 

normally locking the valve handle in the selected 
open or closed position. The valve handle is 

longitudinally extensible to release the stop pin and 
permit ball valve rotation with an increased moment 

arm.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates generally to ball 
valve couplings of the type having an identical pair 
of ball valve units adapted for releasible connection 
in in-line, face-to-face relation, for use in fluid 
handling or fluid transfer applications. More 
specifically, this invention relates to an improved 
ball valve coupling having lock-out means for 
preventing valve opening unless the ball valve units 
are fully and properly engaged in fluid-sealed 
relation, and for preventing disassembly of the ball 
valve units unless the valves are closed. Such a coupling is known from US-A-4 438 779. Ball valve couplings are generally known in 
the art for use in releasible in-line connection of a 
pair of fluid flow conduits. The ball valve coupling 
typically comprises a pair of ball valve units 
adapted for mounting onto the ends of a pair of fluid 
flow conduits, wherein the ball valve units in turn 
include quick connect coupling members to accommodate 
relatively rapid and easy interconnection in 
fluid-sealed relation. The thus-assembled ball valve 
units additionally include a corresponding pair of 
rotatable ball valves movable between closed and open 
positions for correspondingly preventing and 
permitting fluid flow. A variety of ball valve 
configurations have been proposed in the prior art, 
with a view toward reducing or eliminating 
significant residual volume between the ball valves  
 
in the closed positions, thereby reducing or 
eliminating undesired fluid spillage when the ball 
valve units are disassembled. Ball valve couplings 
of this general type are used in a wide range of 
fluid handling applications, particularly such as a 
fuel handling environment. In recent years, considerable design 
emphasis has focused upon ball valve couplings of a 
so-called sexless or unisex geometry wherein two 
matching or identical ball valve units are provided 
for relatively quick and easy releasible 
interconnection in an in-line, face-to-face 
relation. The provision of a sexless ball valve 
coupling beneficially ensures that any two ball valve 
units in a fluid handling environment may be 
assembled and disassembled quickly and easily, 
without limiting the assembled coupling to 
traditional male-female structures. In addition, 
such sexless couplings have included safety features 
intended to minimize fluid spillage attributable to 
attempted fluid flow prior to full and proper sealed 
interconnection of the ball valve units, or attempted 
disassembly of the ball valve units prior to full 
closure of the
