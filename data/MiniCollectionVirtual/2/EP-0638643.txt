<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to endothelin converting 
enzymes of human blood origin or human cell orign having the 
activity of converting big endothelin to endothelin and also 
to a process for preparing endothelin converting enzymes 
from human blood and human cells by extraction and 
purification. Endothelin is an endothelial cell-derived vascular 
smooth muscle constricting factor discovered by Yanagisawa 
et al. in 1988, the presence of which has been identified in 
porcine, bovine and human or the like [M. Yanagisawa et al., 
Nature, Vol. 332, 411 (1988)]. Endothelin includes three types of isopeptides 
which are named endothelin-1, endothelin-2 and endothelin-3, 
respectively. Of these isopeptides, endothelin-1 has been 
confirmed to show the highest activity in human body. 
Endothelin, having strong and lasting action of constricting 
vascular smooth muscle cell and trachea, induces 
hypertension and constriction of respiratory tract and also 
induces at a high concentration (about 1 - 50 pmol/ml in 
blood level) ischemic cerebral and cardiac diseases such as 
cerebral apoplexy, stenocardia, myocardial infarction, 
cardiac incompetence and arrhythmia, nephropathy such as  
 
nephritis, circulatory failure of lung, liver and intestine, 
and asthma, thus sometimes bringing animals to the death. Endothelin-1 is a 21-amino acid peptide which is 
produced by cleaving its precursor peptide, big endothelin-1 
of the formula: 
with the endothelin converting enzyme at the bond between 
the tryptophane residue at the 21st position from the N-terminus 
and the valine residue at the 22nd position from 
the N-terminus (shown by the downward arrow). This 
hydrolysis process is considered to be essential for 
production of endothelin-1 in vivo. Endothelin converting 
enzymes of bovine origin are those derived from cultured 
bovine endothelial cells or the like [K. Okada et al., 
Biochemical and Biophysical Research Communications, 171, 
No. 3, 1192 (1990)] and those derived from bovine adrenal 
medulla [T. Sawamura et al., Biochemical and Biophysical 
Research Communications, 168, No. 3, 1230 (1990)]. 
Regarding endothelin converting enzymes of human origin, WO 
92/13944 discloses those prepared from human lung.  Endothelin having remarkable physiological 
activities as described above is produced enzymatically from 
its precursor i.e. big endothelin. Therefore, the 
elucidation of the endothelin converting enzyme will provide 
a means for inhibiting the production of endothelin in vivo.
