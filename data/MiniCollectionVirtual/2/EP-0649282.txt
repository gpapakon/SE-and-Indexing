<ABSTRACT>
Automated grading of meat (carcasses or cuts, particularly pork legs) employs the steps of: a) obtaining a representative image, or representative images, of a meat cut; e.g. using video cameras; b) processing said representative image or representative images to provide data relatable to the fatness of said meat cut; c) processing data provided at step (b), so as to produce one or more parameters suitable for categorising the meat cut and/or the carcass from which the meat cut was taken; suitable parameters include the amount of fat or lean tissue, the location of fat tissue and the predicted yield of meat product; and d) comparing said parameter(s) with values stored in a database to determine the overall grading of said carcass or meat cut.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a method and apparatus
for grading pigs' hind legs.At one
extreme of the spectrum of products that may be
manufactured from a pork leg is the traditional ham, which
is often sold as an intact, bone-in joint which may have
taken weeks or even months between the time of excision
from the pig carcass to the sale and consumption of the end
product. At the other end of the spectrum, there are the
products of the latter-day technologies such as tumbling
and massaging, in which boneless pieces of meat are
mechanically agitated and recombined during cooking; these
products may be ready for sale within a few days of
excision. The price per unit mass of the finished product
commanded by the traditional ham is frequently considerably
greater than that of the modern ham.A quality parameter that is considered essential in
most meat processing plants is the weight of end product
sold related to the weight of raw material used in the
process concerned. In the manufacture of hams from uncured
pork legs, this weight is usually expressed as a yield,
defined as the weight of end product expressed as a
percentage of the weight of the pork leg. It is important
that the yield is predictable within as closely defined
limits as possible, in order to meet customers'
specifications, and frequently also legislation. For this
reason, yield is always a major criterion in any meat 
manufacturing plant, and it is often the only quality
criterion used regularly in small meat processing plants.
Similar considerations apply in connection with the meat
carcass from which the cuts have originated.The accurate prediction of weight of end product
obtainable from an individual cut of meat is an ideal which
has been sought throughout the meat industry for decades.
The fatness of a meat cut may be a factor contributing to
the variability in yield of cuts of meat, but the
relationship is not well defined.The term "fatness" relates not just to the total
amount of fat in a cut, but also its distribution. A cause
of complaint in the manufacture of traditional, bone-in ham
is attributable to the variability in the magnitude of
appearance of popliteal fat, which appears between blocks
of muscle at the distal part of the leg behind the knee
joint. The appearance of this fat depot has lead to its
common name "star" fat. Excessive star fat is only seen in
a traditional ham when it is sliced at the point of sale.
Since conventional methods of quality control have failed
to predict the predisposition of individual pigs to

<CLAIMS>
A method for grading a hind leg from a pig comprising

a) obtaining a representative image, or representative images
of the exposed broad end

of
said hind leg;
b) processing said representative image or representative images
to provide data relatable to the amount of popliteal fat present in said hind leg;

said data including the amounts of intermuscular fat in a predefined region of the
representative image or images;
c) processing data provided at step (b) so as to produce a
parameter or plurality of parameters suitable for categorising said hind leg; and
d) routing said hind leg to a grade or category on the basis of
said parameter or plurality of parameters.
A method according to claim 1 in which the amounts of
intermuscular fat are estimated by including in the processing of step b estimation

of the mean greyness values of a plurality of predefined sub-regions
within the

said predefined region of the representative image or images.
A method according to claim 1 in which the amounts of
intermuscular fat are estimated by including in the processing of step b

connnectivity analysis of a plurality of predefined sub-regions within the said
predefined region of the presentative image or images.
Apparatus for carrying out the method of any preceding claim
comprising conveying means for conveying a hind leg obtained from a pig carcass;

at least one video camera positioned adjacent to said conveying means to obtain an
image or images representative of said leg, signal processing means adapted to 

provide from said image or images data relatable to the amount of popliteal fat
present in said hind leg; said data including the amounts of intermuscular fat in a

predetermined region of the representative image or images; and to produce from
these data a parameter or plurality of parameters suitable for categorising said hind

leg; and routing means for routing said hind leg to a grade or category on the
basis of said parameter or plurality of parameters.
