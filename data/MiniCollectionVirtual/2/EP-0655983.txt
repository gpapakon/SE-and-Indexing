<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to over and under delivery sheet accumulators. Prior sheet accumulators required considerable time to adjust the accumulator for pass-through, under or over sheet delivery. The present invention solves this problem by providing a retractable ramp mechanism which allows for quick and easy adaptability to optionally over or under accumulate and to optionally pass-through sheets without accumulation into stacks. The retractable-ramp accumulator includes driven endless elastic belts (10, 12) to feed sheets therebetween along a sheet-feeding path (24), a sheet stacker (26) having a stacking location and including a selectively releasable stop gate (16), and at least one selectively retractable ramp (14) for selectively deflecting sheets out of the sheet feeding path (24) for selectively feeding under or over previous sheets that are stopped in the stacking location by the stop gate (16). In one embodiment, an upper and lower set of ramps (37, 76) are arranged such that while one set of ramps is retracted, the other set of ramps is interposed in the sheet feeding path (24), so that sheets can selectively be "over" or "under" accumulated.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates generally to sheet accumulators 
and more particularly to an improved accumulator mechanism 
and an improved method for selectively "under" or "over" 
accumulating into stacks or passing-through seriatim-fed 
sheets, the accumulator employing selectively retractable 
ramp means. Various accumulators have been employed for 
accumulation into stacks of sheet material such as paper 
sheets, documents, and the like. Such uses particularly 
occur during preparation and processing of mailable articles 
when a plurality of sheets needs to be assembled into a 
packet for further handling that may include additional 
collating, folding, inserting, etc. For instance, Luperti et al discloses in U.S.Patent No. 
4,805,891 a standard and reverse collator for stacking 
sheets of paper fed in seriatim thereto from a singulating 
feeder in the same or reverse order as the sheets appear in 
the singulating feeder. Sheets are fed between moving 
endless, elastic belts, ride over a ramp guide, and are 
thusly delivered over or under prior sheets that have been 
stopped against a registration device. Adjustment of the 
location of the ramp guide provides for delivery over or 
under prior sheets. The registration device is movable to 
release an accumulated stack of sheets for farther transport 
after a desired number of sheets has accumulated. Another 
example of an accumulator that relies on a ramp guide 
mechanism is disclosed by Golicz in U.S.Patents 
Nos.4,799,663; 4,925,362; and 4,925,180.  
 Whereas prior art accumulators are in many ways not 
unsatisfactory, high-volume sheet processing imposes 
requirements upon flexibility and speed of adaptability of 
the equipment to vary some of its functions. Such 
variability includes quick and easy adaptability to 
optionally "over" or "under" accumulate and to optionally 
pass-through sheets without accumulation into stacks. The 
retractable-ramp accumulator of the present invention 
provides such variability. Accordingly, an important overall feature of the 
invention is the provision of an improved accumulator and an 
improved method for the accumulation into stacks of a number 
of seriatim-fed sheets. The improvements include quick and 
easy adaptability to optionally "over" or "under" accumulate 
and to optionally pass-through sheets without accumulation 
into stacks. The accumulator and method according to the invention 
are defined in the independent claims 1 and 6. In accordance with principles of the present invention, 
a retractable-ramp
