<ABSTRACT>
A security system for valuable movable equipment, comprising one 
or more stations to be alerted which are provided with a 

telephone apparatus, and a number of mobile security devices to 
be arranged in the objects to be protected, which mobile security 

devices comprise a mobile telephone apparatus, control means for 
the mobile telephone apparatus, a theft sensor, a receiver for 

position information and memory means for storing information to 
be transferred by way of the mobile telephone apparatus, wherein 

the memory means comprise a speech memory which is coupled with 
the mobile telephone apparatus and further a speech generator is 

provided which is capable of converting at least the position 
information into speech signals which can be stored in the speech 

memory.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a system for protecting valuable 
mobile equipment, such as for instance ships, airplanes, 
automobiles, movable generators, trailer trucks, motor coaches, 
and the like. An important object of the invention is to provide 
a system which enables this valuable equipment to be tracked 
again after theft has occurred. Because the objects to be protected are transportable and 
because mobility is very high nowadays and transportation can be 
fast, the working range of the system should be as large as 
possible and preferably cover the entire world. In order to obtain a largest possible working range, use can 
advantageously be made of a Global Positioning System (GPS), 
which enables positioning throughout the world. Other positioning 
systems, such as for instance Loran-C or Decca could also be 
used. Of course, it would also be possible to install a separate 
infrastructure to realize the locating function. A GPS system 
gives a location based on signals coming from a number of 
satellites which have been launched into so-called geostationary 
orbits around the earth. In order to obtain, in case of theft, a 
report at any definable position, the system according to the 
invention preferably makes use of the Global System Mobile (GSM), 
which will make mobile telephone traffic possible in the future, 
likewise throughout the world. In this connection, of course, alternatives are possible too, 
such as for instance the now present car phone networks or the 
cellular telephone systems, such as for instance Kermitt. Positioning systems as well as mobile telephone systems are 
already known. Further, EP-A-0 242 099 discloses a vehicle protection system 
in which participant vehicles comprise a receiver for signals 
transmitted by the satellites belonging to a GPS system. The 
receiver is coupled with a microprocessor which can compute the  
 
position of the vehicle on the basis of the received signals. 
Upon unauthorized displacement of the vehicle, the microprocessor 
can contact a central station by way of a cellular telephone 
system and pass on the actual position. The microprocessor can be 
coupled with a number of additional sensors which can activate 
the microprocessor, for instance if a window of the vehicle is 
broken, the hood is opened by an unauthorized person, or the 
like. A similar system is known from WO-A-93/16452. In the known systems where use is made of digital information 
regarding position and identification of the object, it is 
necessary that one or more
