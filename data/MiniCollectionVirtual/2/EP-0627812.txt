<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a voltage controlled planar oscillator having a microwave transistor as the active component and a frequency-determining switching network connected thereto, which contains a varactor diode and a dielectric resonator. To be able to integrate such an oscillator monolithically on as small a chip as possible, it is proposed that the dielectric resonator is coupled to the switching network via a first microstrip line and that the microwave transistor is connected to one end of the first microstrip line with a first one of its three gates via the varactor diode.
