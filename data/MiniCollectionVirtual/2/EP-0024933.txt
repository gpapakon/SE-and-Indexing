<ABSTRACT>
The gas-phase polymerization of alpha-olefins is difficult 
to carry out efficiently in a stable, smooth and reproducible 

manner and it is usually necessary to deash the resulting 
polymer to remove catalyst residues. 
These problems are overcome by carrying out the gas-­
phase polymerization of at least one α-olefin under the follow­

ing set of parameters (A) to (E):-
 

(A) the polymerization is carried out in the presence of a 
catalyst composed of a solid halogen-containing titanium 

catalyst component supported on a magnesium compound 
and an organoaluminum compound and pretreated by 

polymerising in its presence at least one olefin;
 

(B) the polymerization is carried out while maintaining 
the polymerization system in the fluidized state by mechani­

cally stirring it and blowing into it said olefin in the gaseous 
state and/or a gaseous, easily volatile non-polymerizable 

hydrocarbon;
 

(C) said olefin in the liquid state and/or a liquid, easily 
volatile non-polymerizable hydrocarbon is introduced into 

the polymerization system and the gas-phase polymerization 
is carried out while gasifying said olefin and/or said hyd­

rocarbon in said system;
 

(D) unreacted olefin gas and/or hydrocarbon gas dis­

charged from the polymerization system is partly or wholly 
liquefied and recycled as liquid olefin and/or hydrocarbon in 

(C), and
 

(E) said olefin is blown or introduced into the polymer­
ization system in at least one of (B) and (C).

 DESCRIPTION
TITLE: "PROCESS FOR PRODUCING AN ALPHA-OLEFIN POLYMER"
 This invention relates to an improved process for producing an alpha-olefin polymer (to be sometimes -used to include a copolymer of an alpha-olefin also), which comprises polymerizing (to be used to denote copolymerization also) an alpha-olefin or alpha-olefins in the presence of a catalyst composed of a solid titanium catalyst component and an   organoaluminu    catalyst component.   Nore    specifically, this invention relates to a gas phase polymerization process which can afford an alpha-olefin polymer by an easy operation in a simple apparatus with a good reproduciblity of quality, and which can be performed smoothly, efficiently and stably while avoiding various operational troubles.


 In particular, the present invention provides a process for producing an alpha-olefin polymer or   Co-      polymer    which comprises polymerizing or copolymerizing an alpha-olefin or alpha-olefins under gas-phase polymerization or copolymerization conditions in the presence of a catalyst composed of a solid titanium catalyst component and an organoaluminum compound;
 characterized in that said process is   carried    out under a set of the following parameters (A) to   (E)   
   (A)    said gas-phase polymerization or copolymerization is carried out in the presence of a catalyst  composed of a solid halogen-containing titanium catalyst component supported on a magnesium compound and said organoaluminum compound, said catalyst having been pretreated by polymerizing or copolymerizing not more than about 200 g per gram of said solid titanium catalyst component, of an olefin or olefins in its presence,
 (B) said gas-phase polymerization or copolymerization is carried out while maintaining the polymerization or copolymerization system in the fluidized state by mechanically stirring it and blowing said olefin in the gaseous state and/or a gaseous,
 easily volatile non   polymerizable.    hydrocarbon into it,
 (C) said olefin in the liquid state and/or a liquid, easily volatile non-polymerizable hydrocarbon is introduced into the polymerization or copolymerization system and while gasifying said olefin and/or said hydrocarbon in said system, said gas-phase polymerization or copolymerization is carried out,
 (D) the unreacted olefin gas and/or the easily volatile non-polymerizable hydrocarbon gas discharged from the polymerization or copolymerization system is partly or wholly liquefied and recycled as the liquid olefin and/or hydrocarbon in (C), and
