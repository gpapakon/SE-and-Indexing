<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a cable junction box (distributor) in telecommunications and data technology, which consists of a housing having a jumpering rack. The object of developing further a cable junction box of the generic type in such a manner that, using splicing cassettes and couplers, optical waveguides (optical fibres) can be distributed in a clearly laid-out fashion and ensuring minimum bending radii which have to be observed, is achieved in that a jumpering channel, together with at least one support rail for accommodating the splice-cassette housings and for accommodating the couplers, is arranged for distributing optical waveguides, and in that a running rail is provided below the support rail for the cassette housings, which running rail has an assembly aid which is displaceable thereon.

<CLAIMS>
Cable distribution cabinet in telecommunication
engineering and data technology, comprising a housing (1)

with a jumpering rack (2), the jumpering rack

having a first support rail (3) for holding splice
cassette housings (9),
having a second support rail (7) for holding optical
couplers (13),
having a member (6) which forms a jumpering channel and
serves to insert the coupler fibres and to guide fibres

to the respective splicing cassettes, and
having a running rail (4) with a mounting aid (5),
which can move thereon and is suitable for depositing a

splicing cassette housing in the case of work steps in
the splicing cassette, and the running rail (4) being

arranged below the support rail (3) for the splicing
cassette housings.
Cable distribution cabinet according to Claim 1,
characterized in that the jumpering channel member (6) is

arranged between upper support rails (3) for holding the
splicing cassette housings (9) and a lower support rail

(7) for holding the couplers (13).
Cable distribution cabinet according to Claim 1,
characterized in that the jumpering channel member (6) is

arranged below the support rail (3) for holding the
splicing cassette housings (9) and the couplers (13).
Cable distribution cabinet according to Claim 1,
characterized in that the jumpering channel member (6) is

arranged above the support rail (3) for holding the
splicing cassette housings (9) and the couplers (13). 
Cable distribution cabinet according to one of
Claims 1 to 4, characterized in that the jumpering

channel member (6) comprises a u-shaped basic body (14)
to whose base side (20) an angled-away guide plate (31)

for guiding multifibre units is fastened.
Cable distribution cabinet according to Claim 5,
characterized in that the two limbs (15) of the u-shaped

basic body (14) of the jumpering channel (6) have inwardly
pointing receptacles (16) with sloping insertion slots

(17) which are guided in parallel, open into straight
channels (18) which are guided in parallel, and terminate

in guide chambers (19) arranged in parallel.
Cable distribution cabinet according to Claims 1
to 6, characterized in that the splicing cassettes (10)

are suspended in the support rails (3, 7) in a fashion
preassembled in housings (9).
