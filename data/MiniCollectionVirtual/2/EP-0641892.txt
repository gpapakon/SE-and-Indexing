<ABSTRACT>
The crash barrier has guide sleepers (3), with U-shaped rails (10), open at the top, for reinforcement. The rails extend from areas below the slightly inclined approach bars (5) to approx. half the height (H) of the guide sleepers. The end faces of the vertical rail flanks are fitted to the inner shape of the bars, to the flat side faces (7) of the sleepers, and to transitional sections, and are welded to these. The base of each rail has a long bore. An anchor passes through the bore, and the rail may be pivoted relative to it. The guide bars (4) are formed as trapezoidal hoods, open at the bottom.

A crash barrier for a central strip separating two 
carriageways and made up of a number of internally 

reinforced check sills (3) of trapezoidal cross-section, 
releasably placed end to end, with lateral 

buffer arms (5) and connecting plates (16) at the ends, 
and longitudinal check members (4) disposed above the 

check sills (3) and connected thereto and likewise 
joined end to end and having connecting plates (28) at 

the ends, characterised by the following features: 

the check sills (3) are reinforced by U-section 
upwardly open pads (10) which extend from zones below 

the slightly inclined buffer arms (5) to half way up 
the check sills (3), 
the end faces (12) of the vertical sides of the 
pads are adapted positively to the inner contour of the 

buffer arms (5) and to the side surfaces (7) of the 
check sills (3), which are flat and adjoin the buffer 

arms (5) via a curved transition portion (6), the end 
faces (12) being welded to the buffer arms (5), the 

transition portions (6) and the side surfaces (7), 
the bottom (14) of at least one pad (10) of each 
check sill (3) is formed with a slot (13), and the pad 

(10) is movable to a limited extent relatively to a 
ground anchorage (36) and transversely to the 

longitudinal direction of the check sill (3), 
the longitudinal check members (4) are in the form 
of downwardly open trapezoidal hoods, inverted  

 
positively over the check sills (3) and releasably 

coupled thereto by screw connections (20), and 
the angle (α) of inclination of the flat side 
surfaces (7, 22) of the check sills (3) and of the 

longitudinal check members (4) to the vertical is about 
10°. 
A crash barrier according to claim 1, 
characterised in that the check sills (3) and check 

members (4), which are equal in length, are 
interconnected with an offset of half their length. 
A crash barrier according to claim 1 or 2, 
characterised in that oval assembly holes (19, 25) are 

provided adjacent screw connections (24) in the central 
longitudinal zone of the longitudinal check members (4) 

and screw connections (18) at one end of the check 
sills (3), and recesses (32) above screw connections 

(24) at the ends of the longitudinal check members (4) 
extend from the end faces (30) of the check members (4) 

and combine to form assembly holes (31) when a pair of 
check members (4) are fitted together. 
A crash barrier according to any of claims 1 to 3, 
characterised in that the distance (A) of the 

horizontal webs (23) of the check members (4) from the 
surface (33) of the ground (9) is about twice the 

distance (H) of the webs (8) of the check sills (3) 
from the surface (33) of the ground (9). 
A crash barrier according to any of claims 1 to 4, 
characterised in that the lower longitudinal edges (34)  

 
of the side surfaces (22) of the longitudinal check 

members (4) extend a short distance above the curved 
transition portions (6) of the check sills (3). 
A crash barrier according to any of claims 1 to 5, 
characterised in that two successive check members (4) 

can be coupled by connecting plates (28) secured to the 
undersides of their webs (23) and two successive check 

sills (3) can be coupled by connecting plates (16) 
secured to the undersides of the buffer arms (5). 
A crash barrier according to any of claims 1 to 6, 
characterised in that the check sills (3), 

approximately in their central longitudinal zones, are 
formed with at least one opening (21) at the level of a 

transition portion (6). 
A crash barrier according to any of claims 1 to 7, 
characterised in that the bases (14) of the pads (10) 

are formed so as to increase friction or are provided 
underneath with a friction-increasing coating. 
A crash barrier according to any of claims 1 to 8, 
characterised in that the pads (10) are made of 

perforated metal sheets. 
A crash barrier according to any of claims 1 to 9, 
characterised in that the ground anchorage comprises a 

tube (36) vertically sunk into the ground (9) and 
firmly secured to an annular cover (37) and comprising 

a stub (38) with a flange (39) for insertion into the 
tube (36) through the cover (37) and a slot (13) in a 

pad (10).  
 
A crash barrier according to claim 10, 
characterised in that the stub (38) has a predetermined 

breaking zone (41). 
A crash barrier according to any of claims 1 to 9, 
characterised in that the ground anchorage comprises a 

tube (36) sunk into the ground (9) and firmly closed by 
a disc (42) at its top, and two clamping plates (43), 

one above and one below the ground (14) and abutting a 
pad (10) having a slot (13) and adapted to be clamped 

to the disc (42) by a screw connection (44). 
A crash barrier according to claim 12, 
characterised in that the screw connection (44) 

comprises a screw-threaded bolt (45) provided with a 
predetermined breaking zone (46). 
A crash barrier according to any of claims 1 to 
13, characterised in that the ground anchorage (36) is 

connected, preferably releasably, to a pad (10) of each 
check sill (3) by a steel cable (51) of limited length.
