<ABSTRACT>
Disclosed is a process and installation for producing materials for minerally bonded heat, sound and vibration damping components which do not exhibit brittleness when subjected to pressure or bending stress. The basis of the invention is the subjection of the raw materials (assorted, finely divided materials and finely divided abraded products from the textile, leather and synthetic leather industries) to the shock action of heat radiation in order to render them inert and active before being mixed with crystal-forming aqueous solutions of accelerating mineral admixtures and mineral binders. The malleable filler can be processed in conventional mould installations to form minerally-bonded components such as multiple plant pots, insulating sheets, hollow blocks or light wall panels. Air drying of the loosely stored material produces a pourable substance for use as a minerally bonded material in, for example,  iota  nu   sigma  iota tau  theta  concrete, flooring mortar, or as a light additive instead of sand, gravel or stone chippings in any minerally bonded component. Incorporation of a non gas-permeable intermediate layer creates a flexible construction panel for sealing off large gas-emitting surfaces.

components including a thermal treatment for the purposes of an energetic activation of the 

raw materials used as fillers and their subsequent mineralization, 

wherein size-reduced high-polymeric material chips of natural or synthetic origin are exposed 
to a shock-type heat radiation with a temperature gradient of at least 20 K per mm passage 

distance before and after a burning line in which a colour temperature of more than 600° C is 
observed, thereby made inert and activated in the range of a molar energy of 60 to 170 

kJ*mol⁻¹, and wherein hereafter in a first mineralization step of a crystal-forming solution of 
setting accelerators and 
in a second treatment step in a positive mixer an intermixing of the mineralized material chips 
is performed adding binding agent in such a quantity that the binding agents not completely 

enclose the material chips and that they form a durable bond with the matrix of a composite 
material to be produced therefrom.

durably adherent crystal complexes and, on hardening of the binder, permanently cement these 
material chips,
