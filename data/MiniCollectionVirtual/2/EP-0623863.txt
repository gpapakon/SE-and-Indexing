<ABSTRACT>
A system controller (32) reacts to conditions that may 
arise in a plurality of discrete chiller units (10, 12, 

14) all individually controlled by dedicated control units 
(26, 28, 30). The system controller (32) reacts to 

temperature conditions of the coolant when it enters and 
when it leaves the chiller units (10, 12, 14). The system 

controller (32) normally supervises the manner in which 
the chillers (10, 12, 14) are allowed to individually 

increase or decrease chilling capacity, and overrides this 
control when the coolant entering the chiller units (10, 

12, 14) drops below a threshold value. The chilling 
capacity of all running chiller units (10, 12, 14) is 

decreased when this latter condition occurs.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to the simultaneous control of
several individual chiller units within a system that is
processing chilled coolant via common supply and return
lines. In particular, this invention relates to the
control of a number of different chiller units each having
their own respective dedicated control units.Multiple chillers on a common coolant loop are subjected
to the same entering coolant temperature at approximately
the same time. The chillers are typically required to
maintain the leaving coolant at the same temperature.
This causes the individual units to simultaneously start
or stop their compressors at the same time. This leads to
unnecessary and at times excessive demands on electrical
power consumption and excessive compressor cycling in
order to provide the chilling of the coolant perceived to
be necessary. In this regard, each individual chiller
unit having its own particular compressor stages and
control unit is trying to activate the perceived number of
compressor stages necessary to achieve the desired
chilling without regard to what may be happening
elsewhere. This often produces an over reaction. This
over action may include a significant drop in coolant
temperature when increased chilling capacity has been
unnecessarily added.EP-A-0204521 discloses a system in which a controller
issues a load signal to a heating/cooling source to
instruct it positively to load (or unload) a compressor
stage, and in which the sources are brought on-line one at
a time, the controller sending a load signal to a first
source to successively load the stages of that source
until the source reaches full load, and then sending a 
load signal to a second source after the first source is
fully loaded.US-A-4483152 discloses a system in which a controller
activates selected individual compressor stages from any
of the chillers of the system in accordance with a
database of detected efficiencies.The present invention aims to provide a control system
which allows individually controlled units to provide
normal control functions while at the same time
supervising the reaction by the individual chiller units
when certain coolant temperature conditions occur.The present invention provides a process in accordance
with claim 1. The process imposes demand limits on
individual chiller control units whereby the individual
units cannot simply activate or deactivate 
compressor stages. In the event that the capacity demands
placed on the individual units need to be exceeded, the
system selects which individual

A process for selectively adding or dropping stages
(20,22,24) of compression within discrete chiller units

(10,12,14), each chiller unit (10,12,14) having a
dedicated control unit (26,28,30) associated therewith for

normally adding or dropping stages (20,22,24) of

said process being characterised by the steps of:

defining demand limits (CHL_DLM) on the compression

unit (10,12,14) thereafter controls the selected chiller

unit (10,12,14) in accordance with the said changed demand
limit (CHL_DLM) ;
