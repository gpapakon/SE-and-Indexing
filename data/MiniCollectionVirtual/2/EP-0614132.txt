<ABSTRACT>
A developing agent recycling apparatus (17), comprising 
recycling means for recycling a developing agent 

from a mixture of the developing agent and foreign 
substances, the recycling means having an attracting 

member (19) for attracting the developing agent and a filter (20) 
for preventing other materials than the developing agent of the 

mixture from passing, the filter (20) being disposed in a 
region that the developing agent is moved by the attracting 

member. The attracting member is disposed upstream of 
the filter in a gravity working direction so that the other 

materials, like paper dust, can drop by their own weight. 
Additionally there is disclosed a way of changing the magnet 
configuration of such a system when it is not used.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a developing agent recycling
device for recycling a developing agent from mixture
of the developing agent and foreign substances and an image
forming apparatus comprising the developing agent recycling
device.US 4,389,968 describes a toner regenerating device with a
mesh disposed in the route of toner collected from an image
bearing member, and an apparatus for imparting to the collected
toner through the mesh a force causing the collected
toner to pass through the mesh and a force causing the collected
toner to move along to mesh and in which the collected
toner on the mesh containing foreign matter and solidified
toner is loosened so that a solidified toner is
divided into fine particles while, at the same time, the
foreign matter is caused to float up over the collected
toner and prevented from passing through the mesh.US 4,601,569 discloses a cleaning apparatus including a
magnetic cleaning brush for removing residual toner from a
photoconductor. After a developing agent is transferred from an image
carrier to a recording member, the residue that resides on
the image carrier is usually removed by a cleaning blade or
the like and then disposed of as waste substances.From resource recycling point of view, a developing
agent
recycling
apparatus that separates a developing
agent from the residue, an apparatus that uses the
recycled developing agent, and the similar apparatuses
have been proposed. In particular, various simple
construction types of developing agent recycling
apparatuses with a mesh-shaped filter that allows only a
developing agent to pass and separates it from other
foreign substances have been proposed.However, when a developing agent is separated from 
other foreign substances by using a filter, in particular,
a mesh-shaped filter, the mesh of the filter will be
clogged with foreign substances such as paper powder. When
small foreign substances are removed, small mesh is used
for the filter. However, in this case, the filter tends to
be clogged.Thus, since the recycling apparatus should be
frequently maintained, it is difficult to practically use
the apparatus.The present invention has been made from the above-mentioned
point of view. An object of the present
invention is to provide a developing agent recycling
device that prevents a filter from being clogged and to
prolong maintenance intervals of the apparatus and an image
forming apparatus with the developing agent recycling
device.This object is achieved as for the
device by the features of claim 1

<CLAIMS>
A developing agent recycling device for recycling a
magnetic developing agent from a mixture of the magnetic

developing agent and foreign substances,

said recycling device having an attracting member for
attracting said magnetic developing agent and a filter

having a plurality of holes for preventing other than said
magnetic developing agent from passing, said filter being

disposed in a region where said magnetic developing agent
is moved by said attracting member,
wherein said attracting member has a first magnetic
field generating member disposed upstream of said filter in

a toner moving direction for attracting said magnetic
developing agent and a second magnetic field generating

member disposed downstream of said filter in the toner
moving direction for attracting said developing agent,
wherein said mixture is attracted to said first
magnetic field generating member, moved to a position

opposed to said second magnetic field generating member,
and attracted toward said second magnetic field generating

member, and
wherein said first magnetic field generating member
and said second magnetic field generating member are

disposed so that opposite magnetic poles are opposed and
that the magnetic flux density of said second magnetic

field generating member is larger than the magnetic flux
density of said first magnetic field generating member.

claim 1,

   wherein said filter has a mesh.
The developing agent recycling device as set forth in
claim 2,

   wherein the density of said mesh is in the range from
#400 to #100.
The developing agent recycling device as set forth in
claim 1,
