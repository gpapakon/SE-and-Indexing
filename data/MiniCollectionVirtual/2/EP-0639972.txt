<ABSTRACT>
A method for preventing endothelium damage in mammals, particularly for the treatment of cardiovascular disorders associated to diabetes and uraemia. The invention also relates to a method for alleviating pain associated with gout and arthritis in mammals. The method comprises administering to a mammal an effective amount of an SSAO inhibitor to block the formation of formaldehyde in the endothelium or cartilage tissues for the purpose of treating cardiovascular disorders associated to diabetes and uraemia or for alleviating pain associated with gout and arthritis.

<DESCRIPTION>
TITLE OF THE INVENTIONMethod for preventing endothelium damage in mammals and for alleviating pain associated with gout and arthritis. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTIONConventional treatment with diet, insulin, and oral hypoglycaemic agents has been quite successful in ameliorating insulin deficiency and prolonging life. Still, the development of chronic complications affecting the vascular and nervous systems has been difficult to avoid. In fact, damage to the endothelium is widely observed in diabetes, atherosclerosis and hypertension. The mechanism(s) of such serious deterioration is not well understood. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTIONIn accordance with the present invention, there is provided a method for preventing endothelium damage in mammals. The method comprises administering to a patient in need thereof an effective amount of a SSAO inhibitor for the purpose of preventing endothelium damage in mammals. As a preferred feature of the present invention, there is provided a method for the treatment of cardiovascular disorders associated with diabetes and uraemia in mammals. The method comprises administering to a patient in need thereof an effective amount of a SSAO inhibitor for the purpose of treating cardiovascular disorders associated to diabetes and uraemia. The invention also relates to a method for alleviating pain associated with gout and arthritis in mammals. The method comprises administering to a patient in need thereof an effective amount of a SSAO inhibitor for the purpose of alleviating pain associated with gout and arthritis in mammals. Preferred SSAO inhibitors include (E)-2-(4- fluorophenethyl)-3-fluoroallylamine HC1 (MDL-72974A) and derivatives of fluoroallyla ine, semicarbazide and 

other hydrazide. Compounds such as those described in yles et al. (1987 Biochem. Pharmacol. 36:2847 and in U.S. Patent 4,650,907 issued March 7, 1987, U.S. Patent 4,916,151 issued April 10, 1990, U.S. Patent 4,943,593 issued July 24, 1990, U.S. Patent 4,965,288 issued October 23, 1990, U.S. Patent 5,021,456 issued June 4, 1991, U.S. Patent 5,059,714 issued October 22, 1991, U.S. Patent 4,699,928 issued October 13, 1987, European patent application 295604 of December 21, 1988, European patent application 224924 of June 10, 1987 and European patent application 168013 of January 15, 1986, hereby incorporated by reference can be used in the context of the present invention.Also within the scope of the present invention is the use of SSAO inhibitors for preventing endothelium damage in mammals.
