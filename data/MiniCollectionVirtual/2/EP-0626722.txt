<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a semiconductor device and 
a manufacturing method therefor, and in particular, relates to a 
semiconductor device which is applicable to ultra-LSI processes, 
as well as to a manufacturing method therefor. Conventionally, aluminum or aluminum alloys were used as 
the wiring material for semiconductor elements. In 
manufacturing processes for aluminum wiring, a vacuum 
evaporation method was employed in which, in the presence of a 
strong vacuum, aluminum was vaporized by heating and caused to 
be deposited on a wafer. Aluminum is low in cost and has a low 
melting point, so that it is easily handled and finds many 
applications as a wiring material. Furthermore, techniques were known in which aluminum alloys 
were used as wiring material. Examples of such aluminum alloys 
are aluminum-silicon, aluminum-silicon-copper, and the like, and 
in the manufacturing process therefor, a sputtering method was 
employed in which atoms which were abraded from a target by 
means of high-speed particles in a plasma were deposited on a 
wafer. In comparison with aluminum, the service life of 
aluminum alloy wiring is somewhat longer, and such wiring is 
stable with respect to heat processing, so that such aluminum 
alloys have come to be used in concert with aluminum as wiring  
 
materials. Next, the difficulties encountered when employing aluminum 
or aluminum alloys as wiring in the conventional manner will be 
explained. With respect to the service life of the wiring, 
disconnection resulting from electromigration presented a large 
problem. This is a phenomenon in which momentum transfer occurs 
between electrons and atoms when electricity is caused to flow 
through wiring, and atoms migrate in the direction of electron 
flow. When the electron density in the wiring increases, 
localized voids appear in which atoms are exhausted and 
disconnections occur, or localized hillocks are formed at points 
at which atoms are concentrated. When the aluminum or aluminum alloys comprising 
conventional wiring materials were employed, it was necessary to 
employ a maximum current value of only 5.6 × 10⁵ A/cm² in order 
to ensure a wiring service life of 10 years. However, in 
accordance with the increase in minuteness and speed of the 
semiconductor elements, if aluminum or aluminum alloy having, 
for example, a wiring width of 0.5 µm, and a wiring length of 
100 m (resistivity: 3 × 10⁻⁶ Ω·cm) was employed, the current 
density reached a maximum value of 1 × 10⁶ A/cm² or more. In
