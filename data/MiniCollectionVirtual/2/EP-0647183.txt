<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a multilayered
polymeric body of optically thick, thin, and/or very
thin plate-like or ribbon-like layers of one or more
polymers within a matrix of another polymer, which body
reflects light and can be fabricated to have a silvery
or hued (eg gold or copper) metallic appearance, or a
nonconventional hued (eg blue or green) appearance, or
even an iridescent appearance, and to methods of
producing such a polymeric body.Conventional methods for fabricating reflective
surfaces include forming such surfaces of highly
polished metals. Because of the high costs and
fabricating problems involved in using metals, more
recently fabricators have used plastic surfaces which
contain thin coatings of metal thereon. Thus, metal
coated plastic articles are now commonly found as both
decorative and functional items in a number of
industries. Such articles are used as bright work for
consumer appliances such as refrigerators, dishwashers,
washers, dryers and radios. These types of articles are
also used by the automotive industry as head lamp
reflectors, bezels, radio knobs and automotive trim.Typically, such metal coated plastic articles are
formed by electroplating or by the vacuum, vapor, or
chemical deposition of a thin metal layer on the surface
of the article. Such coatings are subject to the
chipping and flaking of the metal coatings as well as
corrosion of the metal over time. If additional
protective layers must be applied over the metal coating
to protect it, additional labor and materials costs are 
involved. Further, there may be environmental disposal
problems with some metal deposition processes.One such vacuum metallized deposition system to
produce bright work and automotive decorative trim is
taught by Eisenfeller in US-A-4,713,143, US-A-4,431,711
and US-A-4,407,871. That system deposits minute
specular islands of indium metal on a dielectric
substrate. The metal is then encapsulated in a clear
polymer.The preparation of multilayer articles of polymers
are known, as are methods and apparatuses for making
such articles. For example, such multilayered articles
may be prepared utilizing multilayer coextrusion devices
as described in commonly-assigned US-A-3,773,882 and US-A-3,884,606
to Schrenk. Such devices are capable of
simultaneously extruding diverse thermoplastic polymeric
materials in continuous layers having substantially
uniform layer thicknesses. The number of layers may be
multiplied by the use of a device as described in
commonly-assigned US-A-3,758,647 to
