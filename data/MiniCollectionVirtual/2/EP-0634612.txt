Cleaning method for exhaust cooking or baking air,
wherein the exhaust air is forced through a bed (9) of a

porous material, characterised in that the exhaust air is
forced through a bed of an absorbent, hydrophilic granular

material (9a).
Method according to claim 1, characterised in that the
bed is used at least as part of a heat accumulator (9, 15).
Method according to either claim 1 or claim 2, characterised
in that the exhaust air, after passing through the

bed, is let out into the surroundings distributed over a
large area.
Method according to any one of claims 1 to 3, characterised
in that the exhaust air is conveyed through the bed

(9) in a passive manner, without an exhaust air fan, forced
by a pressure difference (p
1
).
Method according to claim 2, characterised in that the
heat accumulator is arranged in a region which is heated in

any case.
Method according to any one of claims 1 to 5, characterised
in that the exhaust air is forced through a bed

having an expanded clay granular material.
Method according to any one of claims 1 to 6, characterised
in that, upstream of the bed, grease filtering (5)

is carried out, for example by means of a metal pressboard
filter. 
Baking oven, wherein a bed (9) of a porous material is
provided in a ventilation path for exhaust air between the

baking space (1) and the surroundings, characterised in that
the bed contains an absorbent, hydrophilic granular material

(9a).
Baking oven according to claim 8, characterised in that
the bed (9) is at least part of a heat accumulator (9, 15)

which is preferably arranged in a region (7) that is to be
heated in any case, such as in the region of a hob (21)

arranged above the baking oven.
Baking oven according to either claim 8 or claim 9,
characterised in that distributed exhaust air outlets

opening out into the surroundings are provided downstream of
the bed and, when a hob (21) is arranged above the baking

oven, they are preferably constituted by slots and slits
which are provided on the hob in any case.
Baking oven according to any one of claims 8 to 10,
characterised in that no exhaust air fan is provided and the

exhaust air is conveyed by means of a pressure difference
(p
1
, p
n
) between the baking space and the surroundings.
Baking oven according to any one of claims 8 to 11,
characterised in that a grease filter (5), for example of

metal pressboard, is arranged upstream of the bed.
Baking oven according to any one of claims 8 to 12,
characterised in that the granular material is at least

mainly expanded clay.
Baking oven according to any one of claims 8 to 13,
characterised in that an exhaust air outlet opening (3), 

which preferably opens out into the baking space (1) by way
of a grease filter (5), is preferably provided on the upper

side of the baking space, preferably substantially
centrally, and in that the outlet opening (3) opens out into

the bed (9) which is arranged in a cavity (7) communicating
with the surroundings.
Baking oven according to any one of claims 8 to 14,
characterised in that the bed (9) is a granular material

cartridge which is surrounded, with spacing, by a jacket
(15), preferably of metal, which jacket at least co-defines

at least one opening into the surroundings, and/or part of
the outer face of the granular material cartridge is

substantially airtight (15a).
Baking oven according to any one of claims 8 to 15,
characterised in that at least the bed (9) is in the form of

an exchangeable vapour condenser cartridge.
Vapour condenser, characterised in that it comprises a
granular material body (9) of porous, absorbent, hydrophilic

granular material (9a).
Vapour condenser according to claim 17, characterised
in that a jacket, preferably a metal jacket, is provided

with spacing from the granular material body (9) and/or a
portion of the outer face of the granular material body is

substantially airtight (15a).
Vapour condenser according to either claim 17 or claim
18, characterised in that it is cylindrical and a connection

branch or a connection sleeve (11) is provided centrally on
the granular material body (9) for the attachment of the

vapour condenser. 
Vapour condenser according to either claim 17 or claim
18, characterised in that it is substantially in cube form

and, in the region of one cube edge, a connection branch or
a connection sleeve (11) is provided on the granular

material body (9).
Use of porous, absorbent, hydrophilic granular material
for the vapour filtering of exhaust cooking or baking air.
Use according to claim 21, of expanded clay granular
material.
