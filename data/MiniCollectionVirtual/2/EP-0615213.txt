<ABSTRACT>
A process of high speed handling of mail is disclosed. It uses a 
mailing machine capable of processing mixed mail of varying thickness 

and size. Each mail piece is transported to a station and indicia is 
printed on the mail piece. The process includes at least two user-selectable 

operating modes including a first non-weigh mode and a 
second weigh mode wherein each mail piece is weighed and the printed 

indicia reflects the mail piece weight. In the process, the timing of 
functions performed on each mail piece are controlled in accordance 

with the mode selected by the user and in accordance with the 
thickness or size of the mail piece.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a process of high speed handling of mail in a mailing machine, see US-A-3 877 531 or
GB-A-2 195 312, for example. Reference is also directed to FR-A-2 388 352.Automatic mailing machines typically include imprinting systems, such as postage meters where the information
imprinted on the envelope or other sheet-like medium is attributable to a variable parameter of the medium.Such a system in valves imprinting a postage value indicia on an envelope wherein the postage value is based on the weight of the envelope.In the mail processing field, it is desirable for a system operator to be able to deliver to mail processing equipment
a batch of "mixed mail," that is, the batch is comprised of a large number of envelopes of varying dimensions, and
variable thickness or weight. The ability of a mail processing system to process a large variety of mixed mail eliminates
the need for the system operator to perform a preliminary step of presorting the mail. It is further desirable for mail
processing equipment to be able to weigh the individual envelopes and affix the appropriate postage value indicia in
accordance with the envelope weight. It is generally considered advantageous if the mail processing equipment can
imprint a quality indicia upon envelopes varying in thickness from that of a postcard to approximately three-quarters
(3/4) of an inch, i.e. 19 mm.It is known to provide mail processing equipment comprised of a feeder for singularly delivering envelopes in series
to a transport assembly. The transport assembly deposits each envelope on a scale for weighing. After a sufficient time
to assure a true scale reading of the envelope weight, commonly referred to as "weigh on the pause," the transport
assembly again assumes control over the envelope and delivers the envelope to a so-called mailing machine. Such a
mailing machine is most commonly comprised of an integral transport assembly and attached rotary print drum type
postage meter. The mailing machine transport assembly assumes speed control over the envelope performing any
necessary speed adjustments to the envelope required to match the envelope traversing speed with the imprinting
speed of the postage meter print drum to promote a quality indicia print. It is known for the postage meter to include
a value setting mechanism and to adjust the postage meter printing mechanism for printing of the appropriate postage
rate on the approaching envelope according to the envelope weight as determined by the scale. Reference is made

<CLAIMS>
A process of high speed handling of mail in a mailing machine capable
of processing mixed mail of varying thickness and size, said process

including at least the functions of transporting each mailpiece to a station (17,
19, 21, 23, 25, 27, 35) and printing indicia on the mailpiece, said process

including at least two user-selectable operating modes including a first non-weigh
mode and a second weigh mode wherein each mail piece is weighed

and the printed indicia reflects the mailpiece weight, 
characterized by
 said
process further including controlling the timing of said functions performed on

each mail piece in accordance with the mode selected by the user and in
accordance with the thickness or size of the mailpiece.
The process as claimed in Claim 1, wherein the functions further
include singulating the mail, and sealing open flaps on each mailpiece.
The process of Claim 1 or 2, wherein the processing functions occur

seriatim
 in the order of singulating, sealing, weighing, and printing, and
wherein the functions to be applied to each mailpiece are time-interleaved to

increase mailpiece throughout.
The process of Claim 1, 2 or 3, wherein the mailpiece thickness is
measured during the singulating step.
