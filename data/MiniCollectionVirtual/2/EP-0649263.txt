<ABSTRACT>
A VTR equipped with an LCD projector integral therewith, 
capable of eliminating the complexity of wirings and 

preventing degradation of video signals. The VTR includes a 
front screen, a rear screen disposed on a front panel of a VCR 

body and constructed to be openable and closable for the LCD 
projector projecting the image, a closing detecting unit for 

detecting an openable or closable state of the rear screen, an 
image inverting unit for laterally inverting a direction of 

the image to be projected onto the rear screen, the rear 
screen being opened when a viewer observes the image projected 

on the front screen, while being closed when the viewer 
observes the image projected on the rear screen, the detecting 

unit informing the image inverting means of the closed state 
of the rear screen, and the image inverting unit laterally 

inverting the image to be projected onto the rear screen upon 
receiving the information.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a combination of a 
projector using liquid crystal display (LCD) and a video 
tape recorder (VTR), and more particularly to a VTR equipped 
with a color LCD projector. Today, LCD projectors are widely used as application of 
LCDs. Since the cost per inch of a screen is high, an LCD 
projector for a large screen is very expensive. As a result, 
such an expensive large screen type LCD projector is mainly 
used only for business purposes. Moreover, most of large 
screen type LCD projectors have a fixed type construction, not 
a portable type, because they require a large lens size. Mainly, compact LCD projectors of the portable type are 
commercially available. Such a compact LCD projector allows 
the user to view an image photographed by a video cassette 
recorder equipped with a camera integral therewith on a trip 
even when there is no TV by projecting the image onto a wall 
surface or a screen. Since the compact LCD projector uses a  
 
LCD having a size of 0.7 to 1 inch, it is convenient to be 
carried by the user. FIG. 1 is a schematic view for explaining operation of an 
LCD projector. In FIG. 1, the reference numeral 1 denotes a 
projection lens, 2 an LCD panel, 3 a condensing lens, 4 a 
reflector, 5 a halogen lamp, and 8 a screen such as a wall 
surface. Liquid crystal does not emit light by itself and 
receives light from outside to display a video signal using a 
variation in reflectivity and transmittivity of a liquid 
crystal cell. The LCD projector achieves a picture 
reproduction using a projection of a pattern of light 
transmitting through the liquid crystal panel 2 on a front 
surface of the liquid crystal panel 2. As shown in FIG. 1, light emerging from the halogen lamp 
5 as a light source arranged in rear of the liquid crystal 
panel 2 is reflected by the reflector 4 and then introduced in 
the condensing lens 3 which, in turn, converts the received 
light into a parallel light. The reason why all of the light 
beams incident on the liquid crystal panel 2 are converted 
into the parallel light by the condensing lens 3 is because in 
the case of light other than the parallel light, the 
transmittivity thereof may be varied in the liquid crystal 
panel 2. The parallel light incident on the liquid crystal panel 
2 is then subjected to a spatial modulation appropriate to  
 
video signals. The light which has been subjected to the 
spatial modulation then enters the projection lens 1 which, in 
turn, projects the light onto the screen 8 arranged in front 
of

A video tape recorder equipped with a liquid crystal 
display projector for projecting an image onto a front screen 

such as a wall surface, comprising: 
   a rear screen disposed on a front panel of a body of the 

video tape recorder and constructed to be openable and 
closable for the liquid crystal display projector projecting 

the image; 
   detecting means for detecting an openable or closable 

state of the rear screen; 
   image inverting means for laterally inverting a direction 

of the image to be projected onto the rear screen; 
   the rear screen being opened when a viewer observes the 

image projected on the front screen, while being closed when 
the viewer observes the image projected on the rear screen; 

   the detecting means informing the image inverting means 
of the closed state of the rear screen; and 

   the image inverting means laterally inverting the image 
to be projected onto the rear screen upon receiving the 

information. 
The video tape recorder in accordance with claim 1, 
wherein the image inverting means is adapted to inversely scan 

a string of pulses for driving a liquid crystal display panel 
 

and thereby obtain an inverted image. 
A video tape recorder equipped with a liquid crystal 
display projector for projecting an image onto a front screen 

such as a wall surface, comprising: 
   a rear screen disposed on a top panel of a body of the 

video tape recorder and constructed for the liquid crystal 
display projector projecting the image; 

   reflection means for projecting the image onto the rear 
screen, the reflection means being movable between a laid-down 

position and a stand-up position; and 
   the reflection means allowing the image to be projected 

onto the front screen by the movement thereof to the laid-down 
position when a viewer desires to observe the image projected 

onto the front screen, while allowing the image to be 
projected onto the rear screen by the movement thereof to the 

stand-up position when the viewer desires to observe the image
