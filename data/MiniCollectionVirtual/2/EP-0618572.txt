<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a magnetooptical recording
medium for recording/reproducing information using a laser
beam utilizing a magnetooptical effect, and more particularly,
to a magnetooptical recording medium on which
high-density information can be recorded, and a method of
reproducing the recorded information.In the field of rewritable high-density recording, magnetooptical
recording media have attracted notice, in which
information is recorded by writing magnetic domains on a
magnetic thin film using the thermal energy of a semiconductor
laser, and the information is read using a magnetooptical
effect. Recently, there has been an increasing demand
for large-capacity recording media by increasing the recording
density of the magnetooptical recording media. The track recording density of an optical disk, such as
a magnetooptical disk or the like, greatly depends on the
wavelength of the laser beam used in the reproducing optical
system, and the numerical aperture of the objective lens
used in the system. That is, when the wavelength λ of the
laser beam used in the reproducing optical system and the
numerical aperture N of the objective lens are determined,
the diameter of the beam waist is determined. Hence, the
detectable limit of the spatial frequency in signal
reproduction is about 2NA/λ.Accordingly, in order to realize high-density recording
in a conventional optical disk, the wavelength of the laser
beam used in the reproducing optical system must be
shortened, and the numerical aperture NA of the objective
lens must be increased. However, there is a limitation in
improving the wavelength of the laser beam and the numerical
aperture of the objective lens. Accordingly, techniques have
been developed, in which the recording density of a recording
medium is increased by improving the configuration of
the recording medium and the method of reading information.For example, in Japanese Patent Laid-open Application
(Kokai) No. 3-93058 (1991), a signal reproducing method is
proposed, in which a signal is recorded in a recording holding
layer in a multiple layers comprising a reproducing
layer and the recording holding layer magnetically coupled 
with each other. After aligning the orientation of magnetization
in the reproducing layer, the reproducing layer
is heated by projecting a laser beam, the signal recorded in
the recording holding layer is transferred to the region
whose temperature has been raised, and the transferred signal
is read.According to this method, the region, whose temperature
has
