<ABSTRACT>
In a lying surface for beds, sofas and the like with an air supply, the air is distributed in an individually adjustable manner among longitudinal (5, 6) and transverse (15, 16) air tubes. The air supply is ensured by an air reservoir (8) arranged at the feet of the lying surface, into which if required air from the air tubes may be let in or if required let out into the air tubes. Transverse air tubes for the cervical region and for the lumbar region allow the contour of the body to be modified on the lying surface between the area of the shoulders and the area of the pelvis, both in a lying position and in a seating position. The lying surface may thus be preferably used for sick-beds, but also for beds in the home. An additional airing system adapted to the special laminated structure ensures the evacuation of increased humidity.
