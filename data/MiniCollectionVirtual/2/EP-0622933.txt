<ABSTRACT>
The object of the invention is an arrangement by which the abbreviated dialling 
memory of a mobile phone (1) can be expanded. In the arrangement according to the 

invention, an external device (2) is connected to the control bus (3) of the mobile 
phone (1). The abbreviated dialling memory of the mobile phone (1) is copied into the 

memory of the external device (2). The abbreviated dialling memory used by the 
mobile phone (1) is expanded and divided into logic parts.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to radio telephones and devices connected to them.
WO 90/06648 discloses a radio telephone
with an expansion memory card.The limited size of the abbreviated dialling memory has been a problem in prior art
radio telephones. The capacity and use of the abbreviated dialling memory has been
sufficient only for carrying out abbreviated dialling and associated functions. This
arrangement has not satisfied the users of a radio telephone who require several
different additional functions for the radio telephone.According to the present invention there is provided a radio telephone system
comprising a radio telephone in use, connected, via a control bus of the radio telephone, to an external device
having a memory, the radio telephone comprising means for copying the contents of the abbreviated
dialling memory of the radio telephone into the memory of the external device by
pressing a first given sequence into the radio telephone, whereby the memory used by
the radio telephone is adapted to be expanded and divided into logic parts,
means for bringing into use the internal abbreviated dialling memory of the radio
telephone by pressing a second given sequence into the radio telephone and means for
bringing into use the abbreviated dialling memory of the external device connected to
the control bus of the radio telephone by pressing given sequences into the radio
telephone.The radio telephone may have means for controlling dialling function of the radio
telephone by accessing dialling information stored in the external memory, such that the
internal memory is available for reprogramming to provide further operational
functions for a user.
The invention alleviates some of the above drawbacks. The
present invention provides an arrangement by which the abbreviated dialling memory
can be expanded. In order to achieve this, a radio phone may be connected by a
control bus to an external device. The abbreviated dialling memory of the radio phone is copied into the memory of the
external device. The memory used by the mobile phone is thereby expanded and
divided into logic parts for utilisation for further functions. The connection may be
maintained for a substantial length of time to provide the advantages of the present
invention over a reasonable period.By down loading the contents of the abbreviated dialling memory of a radio telephone
into an external memory the abbreviated dialling memory is free to be used for other
applications. When access is required to the down loaded abbreviated dialling
in
