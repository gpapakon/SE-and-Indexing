<ABSTRACT>
A rapid, highly sensitive determination, in-situ, of the integrity and/or pore 
size distribution of a porous membrane structure (e.g. a pleated membrane filter 

cartridge) is disclosed. The identification of the integrity and/or pore size 
characteristics involves interpreting the residence time distribution (RTD) of the 

membrane structure under test and includes using a tracer gas in mixture with a 
carrier gas as part of a diffusion or bubble-point test. The tracer gas downstream 

of the membrane is excited with a pulsed (or otherwise modulated) light source at 
a wavelength corresponding to the adsorption line of the tracer gas, resulting in a 

photo-acoustic emission. The detected pressure pulse is processed to produce 
electrical signals indicative of the concentration of tracer gas that passes through 

the membrane. A non-integral (or incorrect pore size) device will demonstrate a 
characteristic RTD that differs from an integral (or correct pore size) device in 

either/or (or both) the onset time prior to tracer gas detection and the rate of 
change of tracer gas concentration with time.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates generally to a method for determining
both the pore-size characteristics and integrity of porous structures, particularly
membrane filters and fabricated devices incorporating such filters. Specifically,
this invention relates to a method for determining the pore-size
characteristics and/or integrity of a membrane filter based upon diffusion testing
involving the use of test measurement gases and photo-acoustic
generation/detection techniques.Presently, the pore-size characterization and determination of integrity for
membranes and filters, in general, are performed using procedures which are
referred to as, among other things, "air-flow porosimetry", the "bubble-point
test" or "bubble-point determination", and the "diffusion test". In addition,
hydrophobic membranes, specifically, can also be characterized and tested by
procedures referred to as, among other things, the "water intrusion-pressure
determination" and the "water flow test" or "water intrusion test". Co-pending
U.S. Patent Application Serial No. 08/105525, assigned to the same assignee as
the present application, describes a variation of the water intrusion method in
which electrically conductive liquids are used to identify the pressure at which the
liquid intrudes into and through the pores of the membrane.The bubble-point test and air-flow porosimetry utilize a liquid which
spontaneously wets the membrane in question to create a barrier to gas flow.
Subsequent attempts to displace the wetting liquid with a gas require that the gas
pressure be elevated to some critical level dependent on the size of the pores, or
the size of defects if present, in order to overcome the surface-tension forces
holding the liquid in the pores. The equation for this critical pressure, defined as 
the bubble point pressure, is a variation of the Young- Laplace equation for
capillary pressure drop, in this application often called the Washburn equation:
P BUBBLE POINT = 4 Kσcos /d
where;
P BUBBLE POINT = bubble-point pressureK = the pore perimeter (shape) correction factorσ = surface tension of the liquid = contact angle of the liquid against the solidd = the diameter of the poreEquation 1 is rarely actually used to quantitatively calculate a pore size
from empirical bubble-point data, since the pore perimeter correction factor, K,
is rarely known independently. Instead, since the equation indicates that the
bubble point is inversely related to the pore diameter, it is used to qualitatively
rank the relative pore size of membranes
