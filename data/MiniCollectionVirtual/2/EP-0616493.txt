<DESCRIPTION>
 METHODS AND COMPOSITIONS FOR REDUCING MULTI-DRUG RESISTANCETechnical Field The present invention relates to the use of resistance modification agents in vivo to reverse multidrug resistance in human or animal tumor cells. More particularly, the present invention relates to the use of certain non-ionic surfactants comprising certain amphipathic esters of fatty acids as resistance modification agents.Background of the InventionOne of the major problems of cancer chemotherapy is the existence of drug resistance in tumors resulting in reduced responsiveness to chemotherapy. Some human cancers, e.g. kidney and colon carcinoma, are drug resistant before treatment begins, while in others drug resistance develops over successive rounds of chemotherapy. One type of drug resistance, called multidrug resistance, is characterized by cross resistance to functionally and structurally unrelated drugs. Typical drugs that are effected by the multidrug resistance are doxorubicin, vincristine, vinblastine, colchicine and actinomycin D, and others. At least some multidrug resistance is a complex phenotype which has been linked to a high expression of a cell membrane drug efflux transporter called Mdrl protein, also known as P- glycoprotein. This membrane "pump" has broad specificity and 

 acts to remove from the cell a wide variety of chemically unrelated toxins. (See Endicott, J.A., et al. "The Biochemistry of P-Glycoprotein-Mediated Multidrug Resistance", Ann. Rev. Biochem. Vol. 58, pgs. 127-71, 1989.) Substances which reverse multidrug resistance are known as resistance modification agents (RMAs), and are of importance in potentiating the cytotoxicity of chemotherapeutic agents to which a human cancer has become resistant. Although many agents have been identified as RMAs in vitro, a large proportion have little or no therapeutic potential because of high toxicity in vivo at the doses required to reverse multidrug resistance. For example, metabolic poisons, such as azide, reverse multidrug resistance in vitro but have no usefulness in vivo. Most other highly effective RMAs, such as verapamil, appear to work as competitive antagonists of a drug binding site on the Mdrl protein. Many of these agents also have toxicity which limits their usefulness in vivo. Consequently, there is a need to develop alternate pharmacological strategies for reversing multidrug resistance to provide RMAs with improved activity and lower overall toxicity.Decreased intracellular drug accumulation through overexpression of the drug efflux Mdrl
