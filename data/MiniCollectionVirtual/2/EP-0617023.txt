<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to novel benzimidazole derivatives, a method of
preparing the same, a method of treatment with the novel benzimidazole derivatives,
and to pharmaceutical compositions comprising the same.It is an object of the present invention to provide novel benzimidazole compounds
which are useful in the treatment of disorders or diseases of a living animal body,
including a human, and especially in the treatment of disorders and diseases which
can be treated by opening cell membrane potassium channels of such living animal
bodies.A further object of the present invention is to provide novel pharmaceutical
compositions for the treatment of disorders or diseases of a living animal body,
including a human, which are responsive to the opening of potassium channels.Other objects will be apparent to the skilled person hereinafter.Bianchi et al. in Eur. J. Med. Chem. - Chimica Therapeutica 16(4), 321-326 (1981)
discloses benzimidazolin-2-on derivatives having anti-ulcer and anti-secretory
activity. Clark et al. in J. Med. Chem. 21(9), 965-978 (1978) discloses imidazo[4,5-b]pyridin-2-on
derivatives having analgesic activity.European patent application Publication No 477819 discloses related
compounds which are openers of BK channels.It is generally well known that opening of potassium (K+) channels leads to a
hyperpolarization and relaxation of cells. The presently known K+ channel
openers (e.g. cromakalim and pinacidil) exert their effect primarily via the K+
channel subtype KATP. They have a high affinity for vascular smooth muscle cells
and are thus mostly vasodilators. Recent studies indicate, however, that
K+
channel openers hyperpolarizing neuronal cells also have anticonvulsive and
antiischemic effects in the central nervous system (the CNS) (European Journal
of Pharmacology 167, 181-183 (1989), Neuroscience Letters 115, 195-200
(1990), Neuroscience 37(1), 55-60 (1990), The Journal of Pharmacology and
Experimental Therapeutics 251(1), 98-104 (1989)). Furthermore recent studies
demonstrate that potassium channel openers acting on airways smooth muscle
(tracheal smooth muscle) cells will have anti-asthmatic effects (Williams et al.,
The Lancet 336, 334-336 (1990).There exist other
K+
channel sybtypes than KATP, and one such subtype is the
BK channel, also called the maxi-K channel or large-conductance, Ca2+
dependent K+ channel. The BK channel is present in many cells including most
central and peripheral nerve cells, striated muscle cells, smooth muscle cells of
the airways, the
