<ABSTRACT>
The method for removing liquids, especially waste water or rainwater, from a collector tank (A) to a discharge point (R) via a pipe (9) is called "falling delivery". It consists in installing at least one pump (7) in the collector tank, whatever the profile of the pipe, in keeping the pumping steady-state hydraulic gradient of the pipe between the collector tank and the discharge point whatever the profile of the pipe, in such a way as to obtain a speed of outflow in the pipe which is greater than or equal to the self-clearing rate, and to keep the pipe completely full even if the pump is stopped.
