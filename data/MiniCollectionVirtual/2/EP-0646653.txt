<ABSTRACT>
Surgical needles are produced from martensitic 
precipitation-hardening stainless steel and then vacuum 

heat treated and vacuum cooled to increase its tensile 
strength while retaining the polished surface of the 

needle. A needle made by this process is also disclosed.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to
methods for making
vacuum heat treated surgical needles
from precipitation hardening stainless steel.The production of needles involves many processes
and different types of machinery to prepare quality needles
from raw stock. These varying processes and machinery
become more critical in the preparation of surgical needles
where the environment of intended use is in humans or
animals. Some of the processes involved in the production
of surgical grade needles include inter alia: straightening
spooled wire stock, cutting needle blanks from raw stock,
tapering or grinding points on one end of the blank,
providing a bore for receiving suture thread at the other
end of the blank, flat pressing a portion of the needle
barrel to facilitate easier grasping by surgical
instrumentation, and curving the needle where curved
needles are desired. Generally, extreme care must be taken
to ensure that only the intended working of the needle is
performed and that the other parts of the needle remain
undisturbed.The strength of the material used to fabricate
the needle will, of course, affect the ultimate strength of
the needle. The ultimate strength of a curved surgical
needle is normally expressed in terms of the tensile
strength and bend moment of the needle. By fabricating a 
needle from a higher strength material, a smaller diameter
needle is required to achieve a desired strength. A
reduced diameter needle is desirable, since the smaller the
diameter of the needle, the less trauma is caused to the
tissue through which the needle passes.Surgical needles have been made from a variety of
stainless steels, including 300 series stainless steels
(such as, for example, 301, 302 and 304 stainless steel)
and 400 series stainless steels (such as, for example, 420
and 455 stainless steel). Other alloys employed in
surgical needle manufacture include those described in U.S.
Patent Nos. 5,000,912 and 1,942,150 and in European Patent
Application
No. 0 294 210.In general steel making, 455 steel is an example
of a precipitation hardening steel. As disclosed in
Stainless Steel, R.A. Lula, 25 (1986) (American Society for
Metals), the phenomenon of precipitation hardening is most
familiar in aluminum alloys. The general principle is to
produce a supercooled solid solution from which, on aging,
compounds precipitate. Just as it is possible to supercool
a liquid solution of salt in water, by cooling it rapidly
and carefully, so it is possible to produce a supercooled
solid solution. Hence, at room temperature
