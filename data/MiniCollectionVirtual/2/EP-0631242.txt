<ABSTRACT>
To provide a tape print device capable of printing 
inputted character strings in attractive shaded characters 

wherein the side and direction of shading can be freely 

modified. When a shading added pattern number is set at 3, 
and when whitened-out shaded character is set, then the 

shading direction is left, up, right, and down and the 
shading dot number is 5. Therefore, an inputted character 

string ABCD is printed on the print tape 5 with 5 dots worth 
of shading added to the left side of the letter "A," with 5 

dots worth of shading added to the upper side of the letter 
"B," with 5 dots worth of shading added to the right side of 

the letter "C," and with 5 dots worth of shading added to the 
lower side of the letter "D."

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a text processing 
device, and more particularly, to a text processing device 
wherein when inputted characters or symbols are printed with 
shading, a shading direction and a shading size of the 
character or the symbol can freely be set or set using a 
shade addition pattern. A text processing device such as a word processor 
basically includes a display for displaying several rows of 
text data, a keyboard, and a printing mechanism having, for 
example, a dot print head. The text processing device is 
capable of printing text data for inputted text or symbols at 
a designated character size, character pitch and line spacing 
on a paint sheet with a desired font such as gothic. The 
text processing device is also capable of printing shaded 
characters or whitened-out characters using a character 
enhancement feature. The term "shading" as used herein is intended to mean 
marking made within outlines to suggest three-dimensionality 
or shadow in characters or symbols. The term "whitened-out" 
means non-relief type. In the lane enhancement feature for making the shaded 
characters, the shading direction is a predetermined right-downward 
and the size of the shade is determined to have a 
predetermined number of dots. Applicant proposed, as disclosed in Japanese Utility 
Model Laid-Open Publication No. HEI-1-85050, a tape printer 
with a text processing function. The tape printer can print 
inputted text data on an elongated web-like medium or a tape 
(for example, with widths of 10 or 24 mm) as a print medium 
at designated character sizes, character pitches using a 
desired font such as gothic. Various features or functions 
are added to this tape printer, including a function for 
printing shaded characters or whitened-out characters. In the shaded character printing feature added to the  
 
tape printer, the shading direction and the shading size of 
the shaded character to be produced are fixed in advance. To add shading to inputted characters or symbols with 
such a tape printer, a user may want to select the shading 
direction from, for example, up, right and right-upward and 
also to change the shading size to produce unique shaded 
characters. However, due to limitations in the shaded 
character printing feature, the conventional text processing 
device is incapable of producing ouch unique shaded 
characters. Accordingly, it is an object of the present invention 
to provide a text processing device capable of producing 
decorative shaded characters while freely
