<ABSTRACT>
Amine-free cooling lubricants contain as essential component sets of anticorrosive substances, besides the usual base oils, emulsifiers and solubilizers. These sets of anticorrosive substances consist of a mixture of dimeric fatty acids and one or several carboxylic acids. The latter are selected among the apliphatic and aromatic carboxylic acids. Alkali metal, magnesium and/or calcium salts of said acids may be used in a similar manner. These amine-free cooling lubricants have an anticorrosive effect comparable to that of alkanolamine-containing cooling lubricants.

<CLAIMS>
Amine-free cooling lubricants containing base oils, 
emulsifiers and solubilizers, characterized in that a 

mixture of 

a) dimer fatty acids and 
b) one or more carboxylic acids selected from aliphatic 
carboxylic acids containing 6 to 14 carbon atoms and 

aromatic monocarboxylic acids or
 
the alkali metal, magnesium and/or calcium salts of 

the acids mentioned under a) and/or b) 
is present as the corrosion-inhibiting additive. 
Cooling lubricants as claimed in claim 1, characterized 
in that the base oil is selected from paraffinic, 

naphthenic or paraffinic/naphthenic mineral oils, ester 
oils, for example trimethylol propane esters, neopentyl 

or pentaerythritol esters, from fatty oil derivatives, 
polyisobutylenes, hydrogenated polydecenes, polypropylene 

glycol, silicate esters, carbonic acid esters, esters of 
phosphorus-containing acids, chain-like diphenyl ethers 

and phenoxyphenyl ethers. 
Cooling lubricants as claimed in claim 1 or 2, 
characterized in that the emulsifiers are selected from 


a) anionic emulsifiers, more particularly soaps, 
sulfonates, phosphoric acid esters and salts thereof 

and 
b) nonionic emulsifiers, more particularly fatty 
alcohol ethoxylates, fatty alcohol propoxylates and 

sugar esters. 
Cooling lubricants as claimed in one or more of 
claims 1 to 3, characterized in that the solubilizers are 

selected from water, alcohols, glycols and/or glycol 
ethers. 
Cooling lubricants as claimed in claim 4, characterized 
in that the solubilizer is used in quantities of 

1 to 30% by weight and, more particularly, 2 to 10% by  
 

weight, based on the water-miscible cooling lubricant. 
Cooling lubricants as claimed in one or more of 
claims 1 to 5, characterized in that the dimer fatty 

acids are used in quantities of 2 to 20% by weight and, 
more particularly, 5 to 15% by weight, based on the 

water-miscible cooling lubricants. 
Cooling lubricants as claimed in one or more of 
claims 1 to 6, characterized in that the aliphatic 

carboxylic acids are selected from adipic acid, caprylic 
acid, sebacic acid, 2,2,4-trimethyl hexanoic acid and 

ethyl hexanoic acid. 
Cooling lubricants as claimed in one or more of 
claims 1 to 6, characterized in that the aromatic carboxylic 

acids are selected from benzoic acid, substituted 
benzoic acids, the substituents being a hydroxy group, a 

nitro group or linear or branched alkyl or alkyloxy 
groups, and in particular salicylic acid. 
Cooling lubricants as claimed in one or more of 
claims 1 to 8, characterized in that the aliphatic and/or 

aromatic carboxylic acids are used in quantities of 1 to 
20% by weight and, more particularly, 3 to 10% by weight, 

based on the cooling lubricant. 
Cooling lubricants as claimed in one or more of 
claims 1 to 9 additionally containing polar additives, EP 

additives, anti-mist additives, antiagers, solid lubricants, 
pigments, foam inhibitors and/or biocides. 
Water-miscible cooling lubricants as claimed in one 
or more of claims 1 to 10 in the form of concentrates. 
Water-mixed cooling lubricants as claimed in one or 
more of claims 1 to 10 in the form of aqueous emulsions or solutions. 
The use of the cooling lubricants claimed in one or 
more of claims 1 to 12 in the form of aqueous solutions 

or emulsions containing 1 to 10% by weight and, more 
particularly, 2 to 5% by weight of the water-miscible 

coaling lubricant concentrates for the machining of metals.
