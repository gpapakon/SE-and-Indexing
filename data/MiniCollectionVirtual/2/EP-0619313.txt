<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a novel lithium 
salt of ascorbic acid derivatives. Recently, it has been revealed that active oxygen 
species or reactive organic radical species play an important 
role in aggravation of lesions (i.e., lowering of cell 
function, disturbances, destruction, necrosis, etc.) of 
diseases of heart, brain, kidney or the like, such as ischemic 
cardiac diseases, ischemic brain disorders, ischemic renal 
disorders, ischemic ulcer of the digestive system, cancer, 
arteriosclerosis, diabetes, cataract and the like (I. 
Fridovich, Annual Review of Pharmacology and Toxicology 23, 
239 (1983); J. M. McCord, The New England Journal of Medicine 
312, 159 (1985); K. P. Burton, J. M. McCord and G. Chai, 
American Journal of Physiology 246, H776 (1984); Masao Inoue 
et al., Active Oxygen and disease, Gakkai Shuppan Center 
(1992)). As the active oxygen species or reactive organic 
radical species in a living system are considered, among 
others, superoxide anion radical (O⁻·₂), hydroxyl radical 
(·OH), singlet oxygen (¹O₂), peroxide radical (ROO·) and the  
 
like. In particular, the relationship between the formation 
of O⁻·₂ in a living system and the subsequent damages of cells 
or tissues caused by the active oxygen species have important 
meanings. It is been known that superoxide dismutase 
effectively acts to scavenge O⁻·₂ effectively or specifically 
(D. N. Granger, G. Rutili, J. M. McCord, Gastroenterology 81, 
22 (1981)). Also, it has been reported that such compounds 
as ascorbic acid, α-tocopherol, cysteine, reduced glutathione 
and the like have an activity to scavenge free radicals, and 
that these compounds could prevent lesions in tissues, which 
are seemed to be related with free radicals in pathological 
conditions (I. Fridovich, Science 201, 875 (1978)). As ascorbic acid derivatives having prophylactic and 
therapeutic activity against functional disorders of the 
circulatory system, 2-O-ethers of ascorbic acid are described 
in JP-A 61-263969 (EP-A-202589). Based on the fundamental studies so far made, 
revealing that active oxygen species and organic radicals play 
a significantly important role in causing tissue disturbances 
in a living system, the present inventors have conducted 
research work for finding out a novel type of pharmaceutical 
which is more potent than the above free radical scavengers 
and excellent pharmacologically as well as pharmaceutically,  
 
aiming at scavenging active oxygen species and organic 
radicals. As the result, the present
