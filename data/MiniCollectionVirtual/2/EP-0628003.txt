<ABSTRACT>
Method and device for manufacturing a thermally insulated container (1) for storing and transporting material such as vaccine, biological material and the like requiring a substantial constant temperature during a substantial period of time, the container comprising an insulated first can-shaped vessel (2) filled with a solid-to-liquid phase transforming refrigerant material (5). In a first step of the method a multilayer insulation is baked under vacuum and arranged about said first vessel (2) by wrapping so that it encloses said first vessel on all sides, in a second step said first vessel is inserted under vacuum into an outer vessel, in a third step the bottom part (18) and the cover part (19) of the container are welded together under vacuum. The device for manufacturing the container comprises a high vacuum chamber (28) provided with an input magazine (32) and valve (32b) for said first vessel (2), a wrapper machine (29) for wrapping said first vessel with insulation and a welding station located above said wrapper machine (29) for welding the container parts (18, 19) under vacuum.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention refers to a device for manufacturing 
a thermally insulated container for storing and transporting 
material such as vaccine, biological material and the like 
requiring a substantially constant temperature during a time 
of several months, the container comprising an insulated 
first can-shaped vessel filled with a solid-to-liquid phase 
transforming refrigerant material in which the material to 
be cooled is placed, a multi-layer insulation material 
around said inner vessel, and outer shell halves enclosing 
said inner vessel and insulation material, said device 
comprising a pressure chamber with at least one cryo vacuum 
pump for evacuating the air from said pressure chamber and 
for maintaining an operational vacuum pressure, a wrapper 
machine inside said pressure chamber for wrapping said 
insulation material in the form of a web about said inner 
vessel, a vessel holder inside said pressure chamber for 
handling the inner vessel during said wrapping, and a welding 
station inside said pressure chamber for joining and 
hermetically sealing said outer vessel shell halves under 
vacuum pressure. When storing and/or transporting biological and chemical 
materials one has to consider that these materials will 
change with time, if they are not stored at a certain, often 
low, temperature. This is mainly a problem in the developing 
countries, where the transport of heat sensitive material 
such as vaccines, serum, blood, blood plasma and some enzyme 
compounds is carried out in an environment, of rather high 
temperatures. In addition the transport routes are often 
long and in bad condition, which means that the transport 
will last long. In the developing countries it is also 
unusual that vaccines and the like are manufactured in the 
country, but the demand is almost always covered by import 
from different industrialized countries. This means that the 
transport routes will become still longer.  
 More than 90% of all vaccines require storing at temperatures 
between +2 and +8Â°C and are destroyed or degraded rather 
fast at higher temperatures and also by freezing. As vaccines 
and the like are very sensitive and as the transport 
route are long and hard, a high degree of all vaccines are 
degraded along the transport route before they reach the 
final user in the developing country. Today the vaccines are 
transported between different stations, of which at least 
the bigger ones are equipped with cooling and freezing 
plants. These cooling and freezing plants are powered
