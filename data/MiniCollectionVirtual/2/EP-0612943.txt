<ABSTRACT>
Inductive monitoring device for a valve (10), including a head or moving part (5) situated inside the body of the valve, characterised in that it comprises:   - at least one induction winding (15) mounted on an external surface of the body of the valve in order to develop a magnetic field within this body, so that the moving part can move across this magnetic field; - a detection means (20) connected to the induction windings in order to detect a displacement of the moving part across the magnetic fields produced by these windings, this detection means generating an output signal corresponding to the movement of the moving part; - a display means (95) connected to the detection means in order to display the output signal; - and a recording means (30), also connected to the detection means in order to record this output signal.

<CLAIMS>
A system for inductively inspecting a valve (10) 
having a moving part or head (5) located within a body of 

the valve, comprising : 

at least one inductive coil (15) mounted to an 
outer surface of the body of the valve for projecting a 

magnetic field into the body such that the moving part 
can move through the magnetic field ; 
sensing means (20) communicating with the inductive 
coil(s) for detecting movement of the moving part through 

the magnetic fields produced by this/these coils, said 
sensing means generating an output signal corresponding 

to the movement of the moving part ; 
display means (95) connected to the sensing means 
for displaying the output signal ; and 
recording means (30) also connected to the sensing 
means for recording said output signal, the sensing means 

(20) including an oscillator (40) for generating an 
excitation signal, which is provided to the inductive 

coil(s) (15) for producing the magnetic field, 
characterized in that the sensing means (20) further 

includes a bridge circuit (60) with two coils (15) for 
detecting a change in the magnetic field caused by the 

movement of the moving part (5) within the magnetic 
field, said bridge circuit providing the output signal 

corresponding to the movement of said part within the 
magnetic field, the sensing means (20) further includes 

at least one amplifier (50) for amplifying the excitation 
signal, at least one gain amplifier (92) for amplifying 

the output signal and at least one filter (70) for 
filtering said output signal. 
The system according to Claim 1, characterized in 
that display means is a light emitting diode display. 
The system according to Claim 1, characterized in 
that the recording means (30) is a tape recorder.
