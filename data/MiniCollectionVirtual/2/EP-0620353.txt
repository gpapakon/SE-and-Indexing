<ABSTRACT>
The reinforcement profile (1) is composed of two sheet-metal profiles (3,4) which, on both sides of a longitudinally extending intermediate piece (5,6), exhibit angled-off portions (18,19) and butt against one another by means of their intermediate pieces (5,6) located between the angled-off portions, the angled-off portion (18) on one longitudinal side being provided in an L-shaped and mirror-inverted arrangement and being connectable to an internal mullion-reinforcement profile (20). Such a reinforcement profile (1), positioned outside on the window mullion (2) and, for example, screw-connected to an internal mullion-reinforcement profile (20) with the aid of the L-shaped angled-off portions (18), achieves an extremely great improvement in the rigidity of the window mullion (2).

<CLAIMS>
Section member for exteriorly reinforcing a window mullion, characterised by 
two sheet metal sections (3, 4; 14, 15) which have bends (18, 19; 18', 19') on 

both sides of a longitudinally extending intermediate element (5, 6; 5', 6') and 
rest against one another at their intermediate elements (5, 6; 5', 6') between 

the bends, whereby the bend (18; 18') provided on a longitudinal side is L-shaped 
and in a mirror inverted arrangement and is connectable with an inner 

reinforcing section (20). 
Section member according to claim 1, characterised in that for connecting with 
the inner reinforcing section (20) a C-profile section (21) is provided which can 

be screwed thereto and which can closely surround the ends of the L-shaped 
bends (18, 18'). 
Section member according to claim 1 or 2, characterised in that the bends (19; 
19') of the other longitudinal sides form a box (7; 16, 17). 
Section member according to claim 3, characterised in that the bends (19; 19') 
form a box (7; 16, 17) on each of the other longitudinal sides. 
Section member according to claim 3, characterised in that the bends (19) of 
the other longitudinal sides together form a box (7). 
Section member according to claim 3 and 5, characterised in that each bend 
(19) of a different side forms a half box (7). 
Section member according to claim 3, 5 and 6, characterised in that the outer 
edge (8, 9) of at least one outer longitudinal side of a sheet metal section (3, 4) 

is bent inwards into the box (7). 
Section member according to one of claims 1 to 7, characterised in that all the 
bends (18, 19; 18', 19') are right angles.  

 
Section member according to one of claims 6 to 8, characterised in that the 
box (7) is open on the longitudinal side (10) opposite the intermediate elements 

(5, 6). 
Section member according to one of claims 1 to 9, characterised in that the 
sheet metal sections (3, 4; 14, 15) are screwed together at their intermediate 

elements (5, 6; 5', 6').
