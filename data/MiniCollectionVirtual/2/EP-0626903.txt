<DESCRIPTION>
 COMPOSITE STRUCTURE WITH WASTE PLASTIC CORE AND METHOD OF MAKING SAMEBACKGROUND OF THE INVENTIONFIELD OF INVENTION The present invention generally relates to a composite structural material and the method of making the same and more specifically the invention relates to a low cost, lightweight, high strength, long lasting, crack resistant, monolithically formed composite structural material and the method of making the same in which the composite consists of a core constructed from lightweight, granulated scrap or waste plastic bonded together with a cementitious slurry binder. The core is covered on one or more of its surfaces with a high strength outer layer constructed of layers of non- woven fabric material impregnated with the same ce entitous slurry binder with the fibers in the layers of non-woven fabric material forming a three- dimensional reinforcement matrix for the cementitous slurry. The composite of the core and outer layer are 

 co-formed and cured monolithically with the cementitious slurry being continuous throughout the fibers of the layers of non-woven fabric and the core with the lightweight scrap or waste plastic serving as an aggregate for the core. The composite structural material can be molded or formed in various shapes and configurations for various purposes.DESCRIPTION OF THE PRIOR ARTVarious types of composite structural materials are well known and have been utilized for various purposes in forming a desired structural entity. Composite structural materials are frequently formed into panels which include a lightweight core material surrounded by or partially surrounded by an outer layer of high strength material. The core usually provides lightweight characteristics and insulating properties and the outer layer provides strength, durability, fire resistance and in some instances, appearance characteristics. Various procedures have been developed for forming the core and applying an outer skin, layer or coating of various material to the pre-formed core.Prior U.S. Patent No. 4,505,449 issued March19, 1985 and commonly owned with the present invention discloses a base having a lightweight foam core and a coating of cementitous material covering portions of 

 the core. Patent No. 4,303,722 discloses a panel constructed by bonding inorganic fiber webs to a preÂ¬ formed foam panel utilizing a mixture of thermosetting polymer and gypsum. Patent No. 4,559,263 discloses the concept of binding a layer of concrete to a pre-formed board of foamed plastic resin to form a roofing

<CLAIMS>
WHAT IS CLAIMED AS NEW IS AS FOLLOWS:
1. A composite structural material comprising a core constructed of lightweight particles mixed with a cementitious slurry binder, an outer layer constructed of the same cementitious slurry binder reinforced with fibers, said core and outer layer being co-formed and cured monolithically with the same cementitious slurry binder forming a rigid matrix extending substantially continuously throughout the composite material to form a lightweight, low cost, high strength, insulative, fire resistant composite material having high toughness and ductility properties.
2. The composite material of claim 1 wherein the lightweight particles in the core are particles of expanded polystyrene derived by comminuting post- consumer and industrial waste or scrap expanded polystyrene.
3. The composite material of claim 2 wherein the expanded polystyrene is in the form of beads having a maximum dimension between 1/16" and 1/4".
4. The composite material of claim 1 wherein the reinforcing fibers of the outer layer is in the 


 form of a non-woven web.
5. The composite material of claim 1 wherein the core has two outer layers co-formed on two sides of a planar core to form a sandwich panel.
6. The composite material as defined in claim 2 wherein the reinforcing fibers of the outer layer is in the form of a non-woven web.
7. The method of making a composite material consisting of the steps of placing at least one layer of non-woven web fabric material into a shallow mold, placing a cementitious slurry binder containing Portland cement, aggregate water and admixtures into the mold, vibrating the mold and screeding the binder to impregnate the non-woven web material with the binder, placing a mixture of waste expanded polystyrene particles and the same cementitious slurry binder into the mold, vibrating and screeding the waste expanded polystyrene and cementitious slurry binder mixture to a level with the top edge of the mold to co-form the cementitious slurry binder, the non-woven web material and expanded polystyrene particles and placing a plate on the top of the mold to compress the materials therein and monolithically curing the materials in the mold to form a panel. 


 8. The method as defined in claim 7 together the step of saturating an additional layer of non-woven web material with the same cementitious slurry binder and placing it across the top of the mold prior to placement of the top plate thereon to form a panel having a layer of non-woven web material and cementitious slurry binder on opposed surfaces of the composite material.
