<ABSTRACT>
Method for moulding a make-up composition in a mould which includes a concave moulding surface constituting the base of the mould and a bottom constituting the upper element of the mould and closing off the volume delimited by the said moulding surface, the composition being poured into the said mould in the form of a fluid which then solidifies in order to constitute a demouldable solid product capable of being packaged, in which method the said composition is poured into a mould (1) the bottom of which is at least partially constituted by a sheet (2) of open-cell plastic foam so as to partially impregnate the said foam sheet (2) with the said composition and, after the said composition has solidified, a moulded product being demoulded by removing the moulding surface (1), the moulded product being constituted by the solidified composition and by the foam sheet to which it is bonded and which constitutes the support therefor.

Process for moulding a make-up composition in a
mould comprising a concave moulding surface forming the

base of the mould and a bottom forming the upper component
of the mould and shutting off the space bounded by

the said moulding surface, the composition being cast in
the said mould in fluid form and subsequently solidifying

to form a demouldable solid product capable of being
packaged, characterized in that the said composition is

cast in a mould the bottom of which is at least partly
formed by a sheet of open-cell plastic foam so as partly

to impregnate the said foam sheet (2, 102) with the said
composition and in that after solidification of the said

composition a moulded product, consisting of the solidified
composition and of the foam sheet which is bonded to

it and which forms its support, is demoulded by removing
the moulding surface.
Process according to Claim 1, characterized in
that, after casting, the composition is solidified by

cooling or by evaporation of a solvent present in the
said composition.
Process according to either of Claims 1 and 2,
characterized in that a composition is cast which contains

plaster (CaS
4
.Â½H
2
O) and a sufficient quantity of
water to obtain a pourable mixture, the solidification

taking place after casting as a result of the setting of
the plaster.
Process according to one of Claims 1 to 3,
characterized in that the make-up composition is cast

through the foam sheet (2, 102) put in place beforehand
to form the upper component of the mould.
Process according to Claim 4, characterized in
that the make-up composition is cast through a central

opening (21) made in the foam sheet (2).
Process according to one of Claims 1 to 5,
characterized in that, after casting of the composition

in the mould, the foam sheet (102) is compressed with the
aid of a rigid plate (103) to press it against the

moulded composition. 
Process according to Claim 6, characterized in
that the foam sheet (2, 102) is compressed during the

solidification of the moulded composition.
Process according to Claim 7, characterized in
that the rigid plate (103) is provided with at least one

opening (131).
Process according to one of Claims 1 to 8,
characterized in that a cell structure such that the

volume occupied by the walls of the cells does not
represent more than 3 % of the total volume of the foam

is chosen to form the foam sheet (2, 102).
Process according to one of Claims 1 to 9,
characterized in that a crosslinked polyurethane foam is

chosen to form the foam sheet.
Process according to one of Claims 1 to 10,
characterized in that a foam sheet which has a thickness

of between 3 and 6 mm is chosen.
Moulded make-up product obtained by the process
according to one of Claims 1 to 11.
Product according to Claim 12, obtained by the
process according to Claim 3, characterized in that it

contains hydrated plaster (CaSO
4
.2H
2
O).
Product according to Claim 13, characterized in
that it contains from 10 to 50 % by weight of hydrated

plaster.
Product according to one of Claims 12 to 14,
characterized in that, after demoulding, it is packaged

in a rigid display case.
Product according to Claim 15, characterized in
that the rigid display case consists of a component (3,

103) which supports the foam sheet (2, 102) and of a ring

(4, 104) which surrounds the moulded product and is
integrally attached to the said component (3, 103).
Product according to Claim 16, characterized in
that the component is a base (3) which interacts with a

ring (4) which bears on the solidified composition to
hold the moulded product against the base, the said base

(3) overlapping laterally in relation to the foam sheet
(2). 
Product according to Claim 16, characterized in
that the component is a plate (103) and that the ring

(104) comprises a means for integral fastening capable of
ensuring peripherally, in a removable manner, its bonding

to a cap (111) to form a moulding surface with it.
Product according to Claim 18, characterized in
that the plate (103) comprises at least one opening

(131).
