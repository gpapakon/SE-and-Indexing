<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an optical fiber
amplifier to be utilized in optical communication
systems which perform wavelength division multiplexing
transmission or optical analog transmission, and to an
optical amplifier repeater to be utilized in optical
communication lines relayed in multistage.Optical fiber amplifiers to which dynamic energy
is supplied in a form of light and which is for
amplifying input signal light and emitting the
amplified light are mainly used in optical
communication systems. Especially, an optical fiber
amplifier using an optical fiber in which a rare earth
element such as Er is doped is superior in high gain
and low noise, and utilized in various ways.In such optical fiber amplifiers, it is known that
gain of the rare-earth-doped optical fiber is
wavelength dependent. In particular, in the analog
optical transmission, the wavelength dependency of the
gain hinders the precise amplification of signal light
combined with laser chirping used as a transmitter. In 
order to improve this point, several attempts have been
made to reduce the wavelength dependence.The first example of these attempts is a technique
to reduce the wavelength dependency of the gain by co-doping
Al in an amplifying Er-doped optical fiber.
This technique is reported, e.g., in "C. G. Atkins et
al., Electron. Lett., Vol. 14, 1989, pp1062-1064".
The second example of the attempts to reduce the
wavelength dependence is a technique of shortening the
amplifying Er-doped optical fiber. This technique is
reported, e.g., in "S. L. Hansen et al., IEEE Photon.
Technol. Lett., Vol. 4, No. 4, 1993, pp409-411".In a case of long-distance digital optical
transmission, an optical amplifier repeater comprising
an optical fiber amplifier is used to construct a
multistage transmission line in order to compensate
optical loss due to transmitting optical fibers. In
optical amplifier repeaters, signal light is amplified
with the optical fiber amplifier but in this optical
amplifier repeater, when the signal light is amplified,
noise components distributed in a relatively wide
wavelength range including a wavelength at a gain peak
are added to signal components with transmission
wavelengths of signal light. Here, when the wavelength
of the signal light substantially matches with the
wavelength at the gain peak of the optical amplifier 
repeater, the signal components are amplified by a
higher amplification factor than the noise components.
Consequently, discrimination of signal components and
noise components is easy even
