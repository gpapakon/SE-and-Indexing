<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a surface acoustic 
wave (SAW) device employing a ZnO piezoelectric thin film, 
and more particularly, it relates to an improvement in a SAW 
device having such a structure that grating reflectors are 
arranged on both sides of an IDT (inter digital transducer). In recent years, a mobile radio communication device is 
watched with interest. Table 1 shows frequency bands and 
necessary bandwidths (pass bandwidths/central frequencies) 
in such systems.  
 
System Frequency Band (MHz) Specific Bandwidth (%) 1.5 Times Specific Bandwidth Portable Telephone of 800 to 900 MHz800∼9002.7∼3.84.1∼5.7 JDC of 1.5 GHz1400∼15001.6∼1.72.4∼2.6 PHP19001.32.0 DECT19001.11.65 Referring to Table 1, meanings of the abbreviations of 
the systems are as follows: 
JDC:Japan Digital Cellular PHP:Personal Handy Phone DECT:Digital European Cordless Telephone  As understood from Table 1, the specific bandwidth is 
at least 1 % in every communication system. Therefore, an  
 
RF stage filter which is employed for a terminal of such a 
system must have a specific bandwidth of at least 1 %, while 
insertion loss in the band must be reduced to a considerably 
small level of about several dB. An IIDT type (interdigited interdigital type) SAW 
filter is widely employed as a filter having a wide band and 
low insertion loss. Such an IIDT type SAW filter is widely 
employed for the following reason: As schematically shown in Fig. 1, a surface wave which 
is excited in an input side interdigital transducer (hereinafter 
referred to as "IDT") 1 is propagated to an output 
side IDT 2, so that an output is taken out in the output 
side IDT 2 in an ordinary two IDTs type SAW filter. However, 
the surface wave is bidirectionally radiated from the 
IDTs 1 and 2. Thus, leakage signals are generated as shown 
by broken arrows in Fig. 1, as considerably large 
bidirectional loss of about 6 dB. In a SAW filter of a three-electrode structure schematically 
shown in Fig. 2, on the other hand, output side 
IDTs 4 and 5 are arranged on both sides of an input side IDT 
3. Therefore, no bidirectional loss is caused in the input 
side IDT 3. However, leakage signals are still generated 
outwardly from the output side IDTs 4 and 5 as shown by 
broken arrows in Fig. 2, as large bidirectional loss of 
about 3 dB.  
 In an IIDT type SAW filter 6 shown in a typical plan 
view of Fig. 3, however, a number of IDTs 8 are arranged on 
a piezoelectric substrate 7 along a surface wave propagation 
direction. According to this
