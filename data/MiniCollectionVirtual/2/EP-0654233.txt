<ABSTRACT>
It enjoys a high degree of rigidity and horizontality, 
while at the same time it can be adapted to the bendings 

of the bottom of the fish-bowls, so that the distribution 
of weights throughout the supports is homogeneous. 
It incorporates two H-shaped pieces (1) facing each other 
and braced by means of two L-shaped elements (2) formed 

by two plates folded forming two dihedrons which serve as 
two upper edges. Two swinging profiles (3), forming the 

supporting base of the fish-bowl or the object to be 
supported, are fitted to such upper edges.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention, as mentioned in the title of this 
descriptive report, refers to a supporting device 
especially conceived for fish bowls, the object of which 
is to provide an adequate and easy-to-construct base to 
support elements such as fish bowls or tanks. Such 
elements are relatively fragile and, since they incorporate 
a great volume of water, their walls and bottoms 
must stand great pressures, which entail certain strains 
or bendings that make them to lose the initial flat form 
of their surfaces. On the other hand, it is very important to keep these 
fish tanks or bowls horizontal, to avoid any pressure 
distribution unbalances. The object of this invention is to obtain, at a low cost 
and in an easy manner, a support which provides an 
excellent straightness and a good supporting base, while 
it os able to adapt itself to the bottom of the tank 
deposited on it. Furthermore, the support should have a 
very rigid structure to avoid swinging and to provide a 
greater stability. There are many types of well-known supports for fish 
tanks which are usually classified into two groups: One of these groups refers to wooden supports or furniture. 
Such wooden supports present inconveniences such as 
the fragility and attention inherent to such building  
 
materials and their high cost. Another group covers metallic supports which are normally 
made with tubes of rectangular section determining a four 
leg structure with different bracing beams and a series 
of crosspieces or horizontal upper frame which constitute 
the supporting base of the tank. These metallic supports or structures solve the inconvenience 
of the high cost previously mentioned. However, 
such metallic supports present other inconveniences. One of such inconveniences is that the iron tubes forming 
the metallic supports available at the market are not 
very reliable, as far as their straightness is concerned, 
since they are not straight and squared enough and the 
supporting base thus configured is not completely flat. On the other hand, the sections of these tubes are 
relatively small, due to economic reasons, and the weight 
entails a series of strains on the support. Therefore, 
the frame or upper supporting surface bends downwards and 
the strain supported by the bottom of the tank is higher 
at the ends than at the centre, instead of distributing 
it homogeneously throughout the whole length of such 
bottom. These inconveniences introduce overpressure and problems 
that, on some occasions, may lead to accidents and 
break

SUPPORTING DEVICE ESPECIALLY CONCEIVED FOR FISH 
TANKS, of the type formed by a series of bars and 

elements, preferably metallic; it is characterized 
because it incorporates two similar L-shaped elements (2) 

formed by plates folded forming dihedrons, so that they 
respectively determine a series of side panels (7) the 

ends of which are preferably fixed by means of screws 
(10) at the inner side of the legs of the structure (in 

the example of the preferred execution of the invention, 
element 1), bracing the whole assembly and providing a 

series of perfectly straight upper edges; it has been 
also foreseen that the lower part or bottom (8) of the L-shaped 

elements (2) form, apart from a reinforcement that 
confers rigidity to the beam, a shelf or space to house 

accesories, which is defined, for each element (2), 
between the side wall (7), the bottom (8) and a small 

vertical flange (9) inclined and located in the inner 
side of each L-shaped element (2). 
SUPPORTING DEVICE ESPECIALLY CONCEIVED FOR FISH 
TANKS, according to the previous claim, characterized 

because it incorporates a pair of swinging elements or T-shaped 
profiles (3) which fit respectively on the 

horizontal upper edges provided by the L-shaped elements 
(2) by means of a trapezoidal recess (12) existing at the 

lower part of the vertical section (11) of the T throughout 
the whole length of each profile (3), thus enabling 

the swinging motion of such T-shaped elements (3) 
following a cross-sectional direction, thereby adapting 

them to the bottom of the objects to be supported (14) 
while, at the longitudinal direction, these profiles (3) 

provide a flat supporting base determined by the horizontal 
section (13) of each T. The relevant fish tank or any 

 
object to be supported (14) is placed onto such supporting 

base.
