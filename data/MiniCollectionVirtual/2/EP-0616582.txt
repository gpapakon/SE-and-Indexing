Power-assisted steering unit for motor vehicles with an 

electromagnetically operated proportionally acting valve, 
through whose magnetic coil (2) a supply current flows, which 

is controlled by a power transistor (5) as a function of a 
pulsed voltage with the voltage pulse generated by a pulse 

generator being modulated in its pulse length as a function of 
a nominal value voltage, characterised in that the power 

transistor (5) is supplied with voltage pulses whose leading 
edges begin at different intervals in time from one another. 
Power-assisted steering unit according to claim 1, 
characterised in that the intervals vary in an irregular 

manner. 
Power-assisted steering unit according to claim 1 or 2, 
characterised in that a processor unit (1) having at least 

three ports is provided, the power transistor (5) is connected 
to the first port (14), the processor unit (1) generates a 

pulsed nominal value signal, which is supplied to the third 
port (16), which is connected via a first resistance (10) to a 

first input (19) of a comparator (7) and a first smoothing 
capacitor (11) connected to earth, the second input (18) of 

the comparator (7) being connected to earth via a second 
smoothing capacitor (9) and via a second resistance (8) to the 

magnetic coil (2), with which a free running diode (4) is 
connected in parallel, the output (17) of the comparator (7) 

is connected to the second port (15) of the processor unit 
(1), the processor unit (1) interrogates the second port (15) 

in cycles as a function of the rest of the control system, and 
controls the first port (14) in such a manner that a current 

flows when the nominal value is greater than the actual value 
and is interrupted when the nominal value is less than the 

actual value. 
Power-assisted steering unit according to claim 3, 
characterised in that a driver (6) is connected in front of 

the power transistor (5).  
 
Power-assisted steering unit according to claim 4, 
characterised in that the second smoothing capacitor (9) is 

not connected to earth, but is connected to the first input 
(19) of the comparator (7).
