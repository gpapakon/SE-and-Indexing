<ABSTRACT>
This invention is a process for the regeneration of solid acidic hydrocarbon conversion catalysts, but particularly certain transition aluminas and zeolites promoted with Lewis acids (preferably BF3) which have been used in the alkylation of isoparaffins with olefins. The process involves the removal of some portion of the reaction product residue adhering to the solid catalyst by contact with a solvent to partially recover the catalyst's initial activity.

This application is also related to U.S. Patent Application No. 07/718,394 to Rao et al entitled "A METHOD FOR REGENERATING LEWIS ACID-PROMOTED TRANSITION ALUMINA CATALYSTS USED FOR ISOPARAFFIN ALKYLATION BY CALCINATION (PA-0061)" filed June 20, 1991 ; the entirety of which is incorporated by reference.FIELD OF THE INVENTION This invention is a process for the regeneration of solid acidic hydrocarbon conversion catalysts, but particularly certain transition alumina and zeolites promoted with Lewis acids (preferably BFg) which have been used in the alkylation of isoparaffin with olefins. The process involves the removal of some portion of the reaction product residue adhering to the so catalyst by contact with a solvent to partially recover the catalyst's initial activity.BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION There are a wide variety of hydrocarbon conversion processes usin strongly acidic solid acid catalysts at temperatures low enough to maintain 

 reaction medium in a liquid phase. These processes include oligomerizati alkylation, isomerizatioπ, hydroisomer'ization, etc. The catalysts for these processes include such disparate acidic materials as acidic zeolites, alumi silica-alumina, silica, boron oxides, phosphorus oxides, titanium oxide, zirconium oxide, chromia, zinc oxide, magnesia, calcium oxide, siiica-alumi zirconia, chromia-alumiπa, alumina-boria, silica-zirconia,aluminum phosphat molecular sieves, silicoaluminophosphate molecular sieves, solid polymeric exchange resins, tetravalent metal phosphonates with pendent acid groups sulfated metal oxides (such as alumina), and the like. These catalysts may treated with or compiexed with Lewis acids. A side reaction in many of th processes produces what appears to be a low level polymer or oligomer. Unlike many higher temperature processes, the side products are not coke like
