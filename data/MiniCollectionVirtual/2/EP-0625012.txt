Footpad of a shoe in the form of a separate footpad insert or in the 
form of a footpad part which is connected to a shoe, made of a supple 

to hard-rubber elastic material, providing a generally smooth surface 
adapted to a foot sole and being equipped with a reservoir container 

(20) for a substance generating a cooling (coldness), such reservoir container 
(20) is connected to an opening (34) through a line (22), which 

opening opens into the surface (28) of said footpad, and in said line 
(22) a valve (24) is provided to which a control member (26) is assigned, 

characterized in that the control member (26) opens the valve (24), when 
the temperature exceeds a pregiven threshold value, in that the control 

member (26) is disposed at the surface (28) of said footpad in such a 
way that it comes into contact with the foot sole of a foot, and in that 

said footpad provides at least one local impression (32) which is formed 
like a dimple and stands back against the (non-structured) surface (28), 

and gradually, with a smooth rounding along its entire border, grades 
into the surface (28), and provides a basis, from which a knob (30) projects, 

in the free cap of which said conntrol organ (26) is disposed, said 
free cap substantially lying in the course of said (non-structured) surface 

(28). 
Footpad according to claim 1, characterized in that said reservoir container 
(20) is made of a flexible material, especially a plastic film. 
Footpad according to claim 1 or 2, characterized in that said reservoir 
container (20) is disposed in a place below the foot sole which is loaded 

while walking. 
Footpad according to one of the claims 1 to 3, characterized in that 
said discharge opening (34) of said line (22) is disposed in another place 

of said surface (28) of said footpad than said control organ (26) of said 
valve (24).  

 
Footpad according to one of the claims 1 to 4, characterized in that 
said substance is a two-component substance, for each component a separate 

reservoir container (20, 21) is provided, which are respectively 
connected ti said vakve (24) via a separate line (22), and said valve (24) 

is connected to said opening (34) via one single line for the mixture of 
said two components. 
Footpad according to one of the claims 1 to 5, characterized in that 
said substance in said reservoir container (20) is provided in a liquid 

to pasty-liquid form. 
Footpad according to one of the claims 1 to 6, characterized in that 
said substance provides a high specific evaporation heat. 
Footpad according to one of the claims 1 to 7, characterized in that it 
provides only one opening (34) of said line (22). 
Footpad according to one of the claims 1 to 8, characterizied in that 
said valve (24), upon each actuation, discharges a pregiven amount of 

substance to said opening (34).
