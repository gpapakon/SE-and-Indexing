<ABSTRACT>
A two-handed guided electrical hand tool, preferably a saw with guide plate (10), is proposed, the additional handle (16) of which is to be fixed to the machine in such a way that it can be pivoted into preset positions. In order to be able to perform cuts close to a wall using the tool, provision is made for the grab handle (18) to be fixed to the tool (10) additionally in such a way that it can be displaced on both sides on its pivot axis (17).

<CLAIMS>
Electric hand tool (10) guided by both hands, 
such as stone saws, chain saws, hedge clippers and the 

like, comprising a fixed handle (12) constructed as part 
of the tool casing (11) and provided with an inserted on-off 

switch (13), and comprising an additional handle (16) 
which is in the form of a handle bow (18) and is 

detachably fastened to the tool casing on both sides and 
which can be pivoted about its fastening axis (17) and 

fixed in predetermined positions, characterized in that 
the handle bow (18) is additionally fastened to the tool 

(10) for longitudinal displacement on its fastening or 
pivot axis (17). 
Electric hand tool according to Claim 1, 
characterized in that the handle bow (18) is longitudinally 

displaceable on both sides as far as a stop 
(45) formed by the tool casing (11) on the pivot axis 

(17). 
Electric hand tool according to Claim 2, 
characterized in that the ends (18a, 18b) of the handle 

bow (18) are joined to one another in the pivot axis (17) 
by means of a part (19) which passes through the tool 

casing (11) and which is fastened by a detachable fastening 
means (20 to 23) for longitudinal displacement. 
Electric hand tool according to Claim 3, 
characterized in that the part (19) which passes through 

the tool casing (11) is in the form of a spacer tube 
which is substantially closed on both sides and has a 

flat (19c) of which a portion is received in a 
correspondingly flattened tubular opening in the tool  

 
(10) and can be fastened therein by a clamp device (30) 

releasable from the outside. 
Electric hand tool according to Claim 4, 
characterized in that in its portion lying in the tool 

casing (11) the spacer tube (19) is received in a guide 
collar (32), provided with a corresponding flat (32a), of 

a gear casing (31) into which is inserted a clamp part 
(23) which extends over a peripheral region and which is 

pressed against the spacer tube (19) by a handwheel (20) 
inserted on the outside of the tool casing (11). 
Electric hand tool according to one of the 
preceding claims, characterized in that the two ends 

(18a, 18b) of the handle bow (18) are provided on 
mutually facing end faces (37) with catch means (38) 

arranged in a circle around the pivot axis (17) and 
cooperating with correspondingly arranged catch means 

(39) of complementary design on the end faces (44) of the 
spacer tube (19) inserted between the end
s of the handle 
bow. 
Electric hand tool according to Claim 6, 
characterized in that in the pivot axis (17) of the 

handle bow (18) a screw (24) passes through the ends 
(18a, 18b) of the handle bow and the spacer tube (19), in 

such a manner as to be non-rotatable, and has screwed 
onto its free end a handwheel (26) which is mounted 

externally on a correspondingly flattened end (18a) of 
the handle bow and which detachably clamps the handle bow 

(18) fast on the spacer tube (19). 
Electric hand tool according to Claim 7, 
characterized in that hemispherical depressions (40) 

formed in the end faces (44) of the spacer tube (19) 
cooperate with hemispherical humps (41), formed on the 

ends (18a, 18b) of the handle bow, as catch means (39, 
38), whose peripheral spacing predetermines the various 

swivelled positions of the handle bow (18). 
Electric hand tool according to Claim 6, 
characterized in that on the mutually facing end faces 

(37) of the ends (18a, 18b) of the handle bow there are 
formed bosses (42) which for the purpose of limiting the  

 
swivelling range each engage in correspondingly shaped 

grooves (43) in the form of segments of a circle in the 
end faces (44) of the spacer tube (19). 
Electric hand tool according to Claim 6, 
characterized in that the ends (18a, 18b) of the handle 

bow are mounted on the end faces (44) of the spacer tube 
(19) with the handle bow (18) under prestress.
