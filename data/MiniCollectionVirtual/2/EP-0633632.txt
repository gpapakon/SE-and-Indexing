<ABSTRACT>
This invention relates to electrical connector 
terminal arrays, having interference canceling 

characteristics that meet or exceed the performance 
requirements of Category 5 components. The arrays are 

suited for producing connectors of the type for mounting 
to a printed circuit board. The connectors comprise a 

dielectric housing (40) into which are mounted four 
pairs of electrical conductors (12). The conductors 

(12) are arranged essentially in parallel fashion where 
the respective one ends (16) thereof are spaced apart a 

first uniform distance (22), and the other respective 
ends (18) thereof are spaced apart a second uniform 

distance (24) greater than the first uniform distance 
(22). The conductors (12) are further characterized by 

being arranged in a non-contact overlapping arrangement 
(14) with the respectiv
e conductors of each outer pair 
in a single overlap of each other. The respective 

conductors of the center pair cross each other and then 
each crosses the adjacent conductor twice. By this 

arrangement, for an 8-conductor connector of the plug 
and receptacle type, the inner pairs of conductors 

exhibit a NEXT Loss of at least 45.00 at 100 MHz.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention is directed to electrical 
connector terminal arrays for electrical connectors, 
where such arrays offer interference canceling 
characteristics. The connectors utilizing same are 
particularly adapted for the telecommunication and 
electronic industry, where performance requirements have 
significantly increased to a level identified by 
industry standards as Category 5. This level of 
performance is due in large measure to the need for 
increased data transmission rates requiring improved 
connecting devices, or hardware. The Telecommunications Industry Association (TIA) 
in cooperation with the Electronic Industries 
Association (EIA) has developed a proposed standard for 
Category 5 components, where the transmission 
requirements of such components are characterized up to 
100 MHz and are typically intended for emerging 
applications with transmission rates up to 100 Mbps. 
The standard is preliminarily identified as TSB40, 
August 1992. The invention hereof relates to the 
hardware, but it is important to note that the hardware 
is only one major element of a communication system, 
while another major component is the transmission cable. 
Thus, it is important to insure the use of the correct 
connecting component or hardware that is compatible with 
the transmission characteristics of the cable. Such 
cables are typically high performance unshielded 
twisted-pair (UTP) cables, the performance 
characteristics of which are covered by EIA/TIA bulletin 
TSB-36. Two important test parameters for high performance 
hardware, i.e. Category 5, are Attenuation and Near-end 
Cross-Talk (NEXT) Loss where Attenuation may be defined 
as a measure of signal power loss due to the connecting  
 
hardware and is derived from swept frequency voltage 
measurements on short lengths of 100-ohm twisted pair 
test leads before and after splicing-in the connector 
under test. The worst case attenuation of any pair 
within a connector shall not exceed the values listed 
below in TABLE I, where for Category 5, the values 
correspond approximately with attenuation that is 
equivalent to a 2 meter cable, 
UTP Connecting Hardware Attenuation Frequency (MHz) Category (dB) 1.00.1  4.00.1 8.00.1   10.0 0.1  16.00.2 20.00.2 250.2 31.250.2 62.50.3 1000.4 Near-end crosstalk loss, the more significant 
problem, may be defined as a measure of signal coupling 
from one circuit to another within a connector and is 
derived from swept frequency voltage measurements on 
short lengths of 100-ohm twisted-pair test
