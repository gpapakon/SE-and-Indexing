<DESCRIPTION>
This invention concerns the use of of the 5-aminophthaloylhydrazide*
general formula

which, surprisingly, has been shown to possess thus far unknown
anti-hypoxic and defensive properties in living animal organisms.These properties include the possibility of triggering a
pronounced anti-hypoxic and defensive action when administered to
the organism in doses of 10 to 300 mg/kg.In the FR-1 182 224 phthaloylhydrazide derivatives are disclosed.
In the FR-2 490 074 the use of phthaloylhydrazide derivatives
as plant growing promoters is disclosed. In the WO-82
00641, finally, acyl derivatives of luminol or isoluminol
are disclosed and its use in relation with a method in laboratory
diagnostics of proteases.Attempts have been made to use 2,3 dihydrophthalazine -1,4
dione and some of its derivatives to decrease serum cholesterol
levels (Hall J.M., et al.: Effect of 2,3 dihydrophthalazine-1,4
dione on Sprague-Dawley rats lipid metabolism and serum
lipoproteins. Biomed Biochem Acta V.47 (4-5) pp. 423-433; 1988)
by modifying levels of lipids with very low density. However, due
to certain signs of toxicity, the use of the drug in this context
has been limited. The anti-toxic and defensive action of the derivatives of
this group of compounds were not known and have not been
described in the literature.We succeeded for the first time in discovering a new and
entirely unique action mechanism of phthaloylhydrazides which
manifested itself only with the use of large doses in vivo.This unique action mechanism discovered by us is not obvious
from analyses of the chemical properties.We have demonstrated in experiments that the
phthaloylhydrazide derivatives which have different radicals
replacing the hydrogen atoms of the benzene ring or the lateral
groups, e.g., 2,3 dihydrophthalazine-1,4 dione; 5-amino-2,3-dihydrophthalazine-1,2
dione; sodium salt of 5-amino-2,3-dihydrophthalazine-1,2
dione; 4,5-amino-2,3- dihydrophthalazine-1,2
dione; and 4-methyl-4,5-diamino-2,3 dihydrophthalazine-1,2
dione possess a pronounced pharmacological activity and, if they
are administered in the doses indicated above, also provide an
anti-hypoxic and defensive action eliminating the effects of
excessive leukocyte activity.In the GB-1100911 certain phthalazine derivatives are disclosed
which possess antiinflammatory properties.The two compounds, i.e., 4-aminophthaloylhydrazide and 5-aminophthaloylhydrazide,
have shown that they possess major
therapeutic effects. However, 5-aminophthaloylhydrazide and its
salts met the prerequisites in
