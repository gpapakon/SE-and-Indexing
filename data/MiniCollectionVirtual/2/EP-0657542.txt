<ABSTRACT>
A method for producing a lactate, particularly 
ammonium lactate, by electrodialytic fermentation. The 

production is accomplished by a method of fermentation 
which comprises circulating a fermentation liquor between 

a fermentation part for culturing a microorganism capable 
of accumulating a lactate in a culture medium and an 

electrodialytic apparatus, and removing the formed 
lactate from the fermentation part by means of the 

electrodialytic apparatus.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a novel method for the 
fermentative production of lactic acid. The lactic acid is utilized as a food additive for 
the production of sake (an alcoholic beverage made in Japan 
by the fermentation of rice), refreshing beverages, pickles, 
soysauce, bread, or beer and is also utilized industrially 
for the production of leather, textiles, plastics, 
medicines, or agricultural chemicals. Recently, the derivatives or the intermediates for 
synthesis of lactic acid, namely the lactic esters such as 
ethyl lactate and butyl lactate, have been finding growing 
utility as solvents and detergents of high safety. Further, 
polylactic acid which is a polymer of lactic acid is 
expected to find growing utility as a biodegradable polymer. Heretofore, as means to produce lactic acid, a 
fermentative method using sugars and starch as raw materials 
and resorting to the action of lactic acid bacteria has been 
widely adopted. This method generally implements the 
production of lactic acid by using whey, corn steep liquor, 
yeast extract, etc. as nutrient sources for lactic acid 
bacteria in a culture medium, adding to the culture medium 
calcium carbonate as a neutralizing agent for lactic acid to 
be formed therein, and inoculating lactic acid bacteria to 
the culture medium thereby inducing fermentative formation 
of lactic acid. The method which relies on calcium carbonate to 
neutralize the lactic acid being accumulated in the culture 
medium, however, not merely consumes much time and labor in 
attaining necessary purification but also yields the 
fermentation to inhibition by the formed lactic acid. 
Particularly when the lactic acid formed in the culture 
medium accumulates to a high concentration, the rate of  
 
fermentation is retarded and the productivity of the 
apparatus of fermentation is seriously impaired. As means to heighten the productivity of the 
apparatus for fermentation, methods of high-density culture 
which adopt such measures as immobilization of bacterial 
cells or separation of bacterial cells by a membrane have 
been developed. These methods of fermentation, however, are 
not immune from the inhibition of the fermentation by the 
produced lactic acid. As means to eliminate the inhibition of fermentation 
by the product and heighten the productivity by separating 
from the culture medium for fermentation the produced lactic 
acid, extract fermentation and electrodialytic fermentation 
are conceivable. The extract fermentation is a method which comprises 
continuall
