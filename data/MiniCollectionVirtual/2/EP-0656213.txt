<ABSTRACT>
A combination for administration to a mammal which 
combination employs a therapeutically effective amount of a 

medicinal and/or therapeutic agent to treat a disease or 
condition and an amount of hyaluronic acid and/or salts thereof 

and/or homologues, analogues, derivatives, complexes, esters, 
fragments and subunits of hyaluronic acid sufficient to 

facilitate the agent's penetration through the tissue (including 
scar tissue) at the site to be treated, through the cell 

membranes into the individual cells to be treated.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to the use of certain medicinal and/or
therapeutic agents and hyaluronic acid and/or sodium
hyaluronate in the manufacture of a pharmaceutical
composition for treating certain diseases or conditions in a
therapy.In an article entitled "Solid cores of tumors
keeping out best drugs" by Sandra Blakeslee published in the
July 8, 1989 edition of the Globe and Mail, Toronto, Ontario,
Ms. Blakeslee submitted that a growing number of researchers
believe that a basic misunderstanding of the structure of
solid tumors has led researchers into designing cancer drugs
that are doomed to fail in many patients.She relates that, Dr. Herberman, Director of the
Pittsburgh Cancer Center, said that for decades, cancer
researchers have simply developed drugs, put them in the
bloodstream and assumed they would be carried to the tumor
giving almost no consideration to how uniformly the drug is
distributed once it reaches_the tumor.Her article also provided that according to Dr.
Judah Folkman, a leading researcher on blood growth factors at
the Harvard Medical School, for a long time, physicians have
been taught that tumors outgrow their blood supply. According
to the article that statement is not true. Tumors compress
their blood supply. This compression makes it harder to
administer drugs.The article provides further that most people think
a tumor is nothing but a collection of cancer cells. According
to Dr. Jain, another researcher, in reality the tumor is only
50 per cent cells. The other half is blood vessels and
interstitial space. Interstitial space in a tumor, he said,
can be likened to the space between marbles packed in a box.The article further provides that no matter how
biological agents are mixed and administered, they must cross 
a blood-vessel wall and then cross the interstitium to reach
their targets, cancer cells. The article continues that every
tumor is different and there are different regions within
each. Moreover, tumors change daily as they grow and rearrange
parts. Most blood vessels inside tumors are highly
disorganized as they take tortuous turns and grow peculiar
attachments to nearby vessels.In general, Dr. Jain said, as a tumor grows, its
outer region recruits new blood vessels from surrounding
normal tissue. It also forms several abnormal blood vessels
of its own. As the tumor grows in a confined space, many of
the twisted blood vessels near its center are crushed. In
turn, the tumor cells near them appear to die, although they
grow into active cancer if transplanted in

The use of:

(1) a medicinal and/or therapeutic agent
and
(2) hyaluronic acid and/or sodium hyaluronate in the manufacture of a
pharmaceutical composition for treating a disease or condition in a therapy wherein a

therapeutically effective amount of said medicinal and/or therapeutic agent
(component (1)) is to be administered to a human, together with the hyaluronic acid and/or

sodium hyaluronate in an amount sufficient to provide a dosage greater than
10mg/70kg person 
characterised in that
 the amount of component (2) is immediately
available to transport component (1) at the site to be treated, and, is an effective non-toxic

amount to facilitate the transport of component (1) through the tissue (including
scar tissue) at the site to be treated and through the cell membranes at the individual

cells to be treated, and
