<ABSTRACT>
A piezoelectric resonator comprising an ultrathin 
vibratory portion formed integrally with a thick frame-like 

rib surrounding the vibratory portion and formed by 
recessing one side of a piezoelectric plate; an overall 

electrode deposited over the entire area of the recessed 
side of the piezoelectric plate and covering the surface of 

the ultrathin vibratory portion and the surface of the rib, 
including the inner wall of the rib where the ultrathin 

vibratory portion and the rib meet; and a partial electrode 
deposited over the other flat side of the piezoelectric 

plate at a position corresponding to the ultrathin 
vibrating portion.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to improvement in mechanical strength 
of a resonator using an ultrathin piezoelectric substrate which is capable 
of providing resonance frequencies as high as tens to hundreds of megahertz 
through fundamental vibration. In recent years there has been a strong and growing demand for high 
frequency operation and high frequency stability of various pieces of 
electronic and communication equipment. An ordinary AT cut quartz crystal 
resonator,which has heretofore been used widely as a piezoelectric device 
(such as an ordinary resonator or filter), has a very excellent 
temperature-frequency characteristic; however, since its resonance frequency 
is in inverse proportion to its thickness, the fundamental frequency of this 
kind of resonator with a mechanical strength sufficient for practical use is 
around 40 MHz at the highest. There has also been widely employed what is called overtone 
oscillation means which extracts a higher order harmonic mode vibration of 
an AT cut quartz crystal resonator to obtain a frequency which is an odd 
multiple of the fundamental resonance frequency, but its oscillation circuit 
calls for an LC tuning circuit including a coil and hence is not suitable 
for fabrication as a semiconductor IC, besides the overtone oscillation 
circuitmay sometimes be difficult of activation because such a resonator has 
a large capacitance ratio, and hence a high impedance level. On the other hand, a surface acoustic wave(SAW) resonator, whose  
 
oscillation frequency is determined by the pitch of electrode fingers of 
interdigital transducer, has come to be able to output a maximum of 1 GHz or 
sodue to the progress in photolithography, but a piezoelectric substrate 
usable for the SAW resonator is remarkably inferior to the AT cut quartz 
crystal in terms of temperature-frequency characteristic. To solve the above-mentioned problems, there has been proposed such a 
piezoelectric resonator as shown in Figs. 4(a) and (b). That is, a recess 5 is formed, by machining or etching, in one side of 
a block of AT cut quartz crystal substantially centrally thereof and the 
thickness of a vibratory portion 2 forming the bottom of the cavity 5 is 
selected about 16 Âµm, for example, if a fundamental resonance frequency of 
100 MHz is desired to obtain. A conductive thin film is evaporated onto the surfaces of the ultrathin 
vibratory portion 2 and a thick frame-like marginal portion (of a rib) 3 
surrounding the recess 5 and the inner wall surface of the marginal
