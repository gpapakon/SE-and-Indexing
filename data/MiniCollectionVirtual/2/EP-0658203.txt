<ABSTRACT>
This invention relates to improved fungal cells and methods for producing recombinant products of improved quality and in high yields. More specifically, the present invention relates to fungal cells carrying specific modifications within their DNA sequences which cause them to exhibit at least a reduced capacity for O-glycosylating homologous and/or heterologous proteins, and the use of these cells as host cells to produce high yields of recombinant products.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to improved fungal cells and methods for
producing recombinant products of improved quality and in high
yields. More specifically, the present invention relates to
fungal cells carrying specific modifications within their DNA
sequences which cause them to exhibit at least a reduced capacity
for O-glycosylating homologous and/or heterologous proteins,
and the use of these cells as host cells to produce high
yields of recombinant products.The development of recombinant DNA technology has made possible
the production of foreign products in host cells in which exogenous
DNA sequences coding for those products have been introduced.
The advantage of this technology is that products can be
produced in high yields, in highly purified form, with no risk
of contamination such as viral contamination (AIDS, hepatitis B,
etc.). These recombinant techniques have been widely used for
the production of recombinant proteins in prokaryotic as well as
eukaryotic host cells. Prokaryotic host cells include E. coli
[Nagata et al., Nature 284 (1980), 316; EP 001 929], Bacillus
subtilis [Saunders et al., J. Bacteriol. 169 (1987), 2917],
Streptomyces, and Corynebacterium (EP 433 117). Eukaryotic host
cells include plant cells, animal cells and fungal cells.However, the large-scale production of recombinant products by
these techniques is still limited, due to problems of expression
efficiency of these exogenous DNA sequences, due also to vector
instability and to intracellular degradation of the recombinant
products by the host cell in which they are made. Concerning expression
efficiency, efforts have been made to isolate strong
promoters, leading to increased expression levels of exogenous
DNA sequences, and therefore to increased production levels of
recombinant products. Various systems have also been developed
in order to increase the stability of the vectors within the
host cells, the most frequently used of which consisting in the 
insertion in the vector of an antibiotic resistance gene enabling
recombinant host cells to survive and grow in a selective
medium. With respect to intracellular degradation, several
mutant cells lacking or having a reduced protease activity have
been disclosed, thereby limiting the capacity of said cells to
degrade recombinant products.However, additional problems still limit large-scale production
and pharmaceutical use of recombinant products. One of these
arises from the fact that recombinantly produced products are
often different from their natural counterparts.
