<ABSTRACT>
An operating arrangement for adjustable stator vanes
(14) in a gas turbine engine comprises a control member (30)

defining a plurality of apertures (32, 132) and a plurality
of operating levers (24). Each operating lever (24) has a

first end region (28) to be secured to the stator vane (14)
and a second end region (36). A pin (34, 134) extends from

the second end region (36) to be received in an associated
aperture (32, 132) in the control member. Each pin (34, 134)

and the respective aperture (32, 132) are movable
longitudinally relative to each other. A laterally extending

projection (41, 141) is provided on the pin (34) or on the
wall (50) of the aperture (32, 132). The arrangement is such

that relative pivotal and longitudinal movement of the
longitudinal axes of the pin (34) and of the aperture or

recess (32, 132) is permitted on movement of the control
member (30) to move the operating levers (24). In one

embodiment, the projection (41) is provided on the pin (34)
and, in another embodiment, the projection (141) is provided

on the wall of the aperture (132).

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to operating arrangements for
stator vanes. More particularly, the invention relates to
operating arrangements for stator vanes in gas turbine
engines. The invention also relates to operating levers for
stator vanes and to control members for controlling such
operating levers.Gas turbine engines generally comprise an arrangement of
compressors, fans and turbines. These may be provided with
adjustable stator vanes alternating with rotating blades.
The orientation of the stator vanes can be adjusted by
pivotally rotating each of them about its longitudinal axis
to vary the flow of air through the engine. The movement of
the variable stator vanes is controlled by a number of
levers, each attached by a pin to a unison ring extending
around the stator. As the unison ring rotates, it moves the
levers to adjust the vanes in unison. On rotation of the
ring, the apertures in which the pins are received remain
aligned with the radiis of the ring. The pins, however, are
fixed and do not maintain their alignment with the radiis of
the ring on such rotation. This causes flexing in the lever,
which can lead to failure of the pins or levers.It is an object of the invention to obviate or mitigate
this disadvantage of the prior art.According to one aspect of the invention there is
provided an operating arrangement for an adjustable stator
vane in a gas turbine engine, said arrangement comprising a
control member defining an aperture, and an operating lever
having a first end region to be secured to the stator vane,
and a second end region having a pin extending therefrom to
be received in said aperture in the control member, wherein
the pin is movable longitudinally relative to the aperture,
and a laterally extending projection is provided on one of
the pin and the aperture to engage the other of the pin and
the wall of the aperture, such that relative pivotal and
longitudinal movement of the longitudinal axes of the pin and
of the aperture is permitted on movement of the control
member to move the operating lever. In the preferred embodiment, the projection is provided
on the pin. In an another embodiment, the projection is
provided on the wall of the aperture or recess.According to another aspect of the invention, there is
provided an operating lever for use in an operating
arrangement for an adjustable stator vane in a gas turbine
engine, said lever comprising a first end region to be
secured to the stator vane and a second end region having a
pin extending therefrom to be received in an
