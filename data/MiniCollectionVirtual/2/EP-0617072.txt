Transparent copolyamide comprising the components 

I
hexamethylene diamine/adipic acid with 15 to 75 mole % 
IIa
hexamethylene diamine/azelaic acid with 15 to 65 mole %, which can be 
wholly or partly replaced by 
IIb
hexamethylene diamine/sebacic acid and 
IIIa
hexamethylene diamine/isophthalic acid with 10 to 70 mole %, which 
can be wholly or partly replaced by 
IIIb
hexamethylene diamine/terephthalic acid, the total quantity of the 
components being 100 mole %. 
Copolyamide according to claim 1, comprising the components 

I with 15 to 60 mole % 
IIa and/or IIb with 15 to 55 mole % and 
IIIa and/or IIIb with 10 to 45 mole %. 
Copolyamide according to claim 2, comprising the components 

I with 35 to 55 mole % 
IIa or b with 15 to 55 mole % 
IIIa or b with 10 to 30 mole %. 
Copolyamide according to one of the claims 1 to 3, with a relative 
viscosity between 1.75 and 2.50, measured as a 0.5% solution in m-cresol 

at 23Â°C. 
Use of the copolyamides according to claims 1 to 4 as a barrier layer 
for multilayered structures. 
Use of at least one barrier layer according to claim 5 for producing  
 

multilayered structures by coextrusion. 
Use according to claim 6, the at least one barrier layer being combined 
with at least one further polymer layer from the group of known adhesive 

layers, support layers, protective layers and sealing layers. 
Use according to claim 7, the at least one further support layer being 
chosen from the group polyamides, polyolefins, ionomeric polyolefins and 

polyesters.
