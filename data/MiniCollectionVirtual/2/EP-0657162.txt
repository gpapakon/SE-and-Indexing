<DESCRIPTION>
All mammalian cells require cholesterol as a 
structural component of their cell membranes and for non-sterol 
end products. Cholesterol is also required for 
steroid hormone synthesis. The very property, however, 
that makes cholesterol useful in the cell membranes, its 
insolubility in water, also makes it potentially lethal. 
When cholesterol accumulates in the wrong place, for 
example within the wall of an artery, it cannot be readily 
mobilized and its presence leads to the development of an 
atherosclerotic plaque. Elevated concentrations of serum 
cholesterol associated with low density lipoproteins have 
been demonstrated to be a major contributing factor in the 
development and progression of atherosclerosis. In mammals, serum lipoprotein is composed of 
cholesterol together with cholesteryl esters, 
triglycerides, phospholipids and apoproteins. Serum or 
plasma lipoprotein is comprised of several fractions. The 
major fractions or classes of plasma lipoproteins are very 
low density lipoprotein (VLDL), low density lipoprotein 
(LDL), intermediate density lipoprotein (IDL), and high 
density lipoprotein (HDL). These classes differ from one 
another in size, density and in the relative proportions of 
triglycerides and cholesteryl esters in the core, and in 
the nature of the apoproteins on the surface. In mammals, serum cholesterol is derived from 
exogenous dietary sources as well as through endogenous 
synthesis. Endogenous synthesis of cholesterol involves a 
complex set of enzyme-catalyzed reactions and regulatory 
mechanisms generally termed the mevalonate pathway. Cells 
face a complex problem in regulating mevalonate synthesis 
because cholesterol, the bulk end product of mevalonate 
metabolism, is derived from plasma low density lipoprotein 
which enters the cell by receptor-mediated endocytosis, as 
well as from synthesis within the cell. Each cell must  
 
balance these external and internal sources so as to 
sustain mevalonate synthesis while avoiding sterol over 
accumulation. This balance is achieved through feedback 
regulation of at least two sequential enzymes in mevalonate 
synthesis, 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) 
synthase and HMG-CoA reductase and also of LDL receptors. 
In the absence of LDL, mammalian cells maintain high 
activities of the two enzymes, thereby synthesizing 
mevalonate for production of cholesterol as well as the 
non-sterol products. When LDL is present, from exogenous 
sources, HMG-CoA synthase and reductase activity is 
repressed and
