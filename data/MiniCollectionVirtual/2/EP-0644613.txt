separating the first contacts in each pair.
A connection strip according to claim 3, characterized in that
said second partitions (3B) project forwards and to only one side of

said front edge (31), but otherwise identically to said first
partitions (3A), thereby enabling the pairs of first contacts to be

differentiated from one another on the other side of the front edge.
A connection strip according to any one of claims 1 to 4,
characterized in that said connection block (2) carries a grounding

rod (4) mounted along one side of said front edge in a series of
windows (34) provided in the partitions (3A, 3B).
A connection strip according to any one of claims 1 to 5,
characterized in that each of the partitions (3A, 3B) is provided

with an end tab (35, 45) on its edge that projects sideways from said
front edge (31) or on each of its edges that project sideways

therefrom, said end tab being transverse to the partition, and
parallel and coupled to the corresponding face (30A, 30B) of said

body (30).
A connection strip according to claim 6, characterized in that the
end tabs (35) situated on a first side of said front edge (31) are

coupled to the corresponding face (30A) of said body via a series of
side ribs (33) disposed along said first side of the front edge, each

rib having a front face on which one of the partitions is centered,
and a side face (33A) forming a sloping transition between the end

tab and the corresponding face (30A) of the body, the ribs defining a
series of guide recesses (41) between them, which guide recesses are

assigned to guiding line conductors into said compartments (3).
A connection strip according to claim 7, characterized in that the
end tabs (35) and said ribs (33) are coupled together by a series of

fastening fingers (39), each of the fingers being centered on one of
the end tabs (35) and extending it to the corresponding rib (33). 
A strip according to any one of claims 1 to 8, characterized in
that said connection block (2) further includes fixing means (46,

45') opposite from the compartments (3). said fixing means being at
the "rear" of the block and projecting on either side of the block.
A connection strip according to claim 9, characterized in that
said fixing means are constituted by two resilient clipping catches

(46) substantially at respective ends of said block, each catch being
provided with an actuating lever (47) forming a guide ring at the

corresponding rear end of said block.
A connection strip according to any one of claims 1 to 10,
characterized in that each of said second contacts (10) has its

"main" insulation-displacement fork (14) open facing its coupling end
portion.
A connection strip according to claim 11, characterized in that
each of said second contacts (10) includes a "branch" other
