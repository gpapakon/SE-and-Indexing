<ABSTRACT>
A vehicle signal lamp has a reflector (32)
arranged to direct light from a bulb (30) through a hole

(36) in an opaque mask (34). The mask (34) has a concave
reflective surface (40) covered by a transparent coloured

layer (42) and arranged to reflect light incident thereon
from outside the lamp. The colour of the lamp when not

illuminated is determined by the colour of the coloured
layer (42). Light from the bulb (30) does not pass through

the layer (42) and therefore is not affected by its colour.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a vehicle signal lamp of
the type having a reflector and a substantially parallel-sided
transparent outer cover, optical distribution of the
light output from the lamp being controlled by the
reflector.In known lamps of this type, the reflector takes
the form of a slightly distorted parabola so as to produce
a divergent beam of light. Alternatively, the reflector
may be a true parabola with a mesh of pillow optics on its
surface. The reflector surface is easily visible through
the outer cover which is made of a material of the colour
required for the light to be emitted by the signal lamp.It has become customary for vehicle signal lamps
to be constructed so that when they are not illuminated,
they take up the colour of their surroundings. For
example, a reversing lamp is required to emit white light
when it is illuminated but is commonly arranged to appear
red when not illuminated so as to conform to the appearance
of adjacent rear lamps. Such lamps are commonly described
as chromatic lamps. Chromatic lamps have required the
provision of optical elements on the outer transparent
cover or lens. An object of the present invention is to
provide a chromatic lamp in which the outer transparent
cover is substantially parallel-sided and does not have any
effect on the distribution of the emitted light.According to the invention, a vehicle signal lamp
of the type described above has an opaque mask disposed
between its reflector and its outer cover with a central
opening through which light from the reflector reaches the
outer cover, the mask comprising a concave reflector
covered by a transparent coloured layer and arranged to
reflect light incident thereon from outside the outer
cover.The colour of the transparent coating is chosen in
accordance with the required appearance of the lamp when
not illuminated.An embodiment will now be described, by way of 
example, with reference to the accompanying drawings, in
which:
Figure 1 is a horizontal sectional view of a known
vehicle signal lamp of the type described in the first
paragraph above;Figure 2 is a cross-sectional view, similar to
Figure 1, of a vehicle signal lamp in accordance with the
invention; andFigure 3 is a scrap sectional view of a modified
mask for use with the lamp shown in Figure 2.Referring to Figure 1, a vehicle signal lamp of
the known type comprises a bulb 10, a parabolic reflector
12 and a transparent outer cover 14. The outer cover 14 is
parallel-sided and does not affect the distribution of the
emitted light. The

<CLAIMS>
A vehicle signal lamp having a reflector (32) and
a substantially parallel-sided transparent outer cover

(38), optical distribution of the light output from the
lamp being controlled by the reflector (32), characterised

in that an opaque mask (34, 60) is disposed between the
reflector (32) and the outer cover (38) with a central

opening (36) through which light from the reflector (32)
reaches the outer cover (38), the mask comprising a concave

reflective surface (40, 62) covered by a transparent
coloured layer (42, 60) and arranged to reflect light

incident thereon from outside the outer cover (38).
A vehicle signal lamp according to claim 1,
wherein the mask (34) has its reflective layer on its

surface nearer to the outer cover (38) and a transparent
coloured coating (42) on its reflective layer.
A vehicle signal lamp according to claim 1,
wherein the mask (60) is formed from transparent coloured

material and has its reflective layer (62) on its surface
further from the outer cover (38).
