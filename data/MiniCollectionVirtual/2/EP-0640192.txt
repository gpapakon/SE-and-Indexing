<ABSTRACT>
A counterbalancing apparatus for dynamically balancing an out-of-balance rotating member. A first series of weights having identical size and weight are mounted to freely move within a first groove or race when the apparatus is rotating after being mounted to a shaft or other rotatable member. A second series of weights having identical size and weight are similarly mounted to freely move within a second groove or race located inside of the first groove. The first series of weights is different in size and weight from the second series of weights.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a balancing method and 
member and, more particularly, to a balancing method 
and member used for dynamically balancing an out of 
balance condition in a rotating body. Many different apparatuses for balancing an out 
of balance condition in a rotating body are known. Such 
apparatuses generally include a counterweight having a 
weight of a predetermined value which is located at a 
predetermined position from the axis of rotation to oppose 
an imbalance in the rotating body. The magnitude of the 
imbalance is generally known and, accordingly, the 
necessary weight and position of the counterweight can be 
calculated so that the weight is positioned where it will 
act to counter the known imbalance. These apparatuses 
function satisfactorily for most purposes under which they 
are employed but are not precise or useful enough for 
other applications. Under dynamic conditions; that is, when a body 
is rotating about an axis and an imbalance in the rotating 
body develops because of external conditions or otherwise, 
the prior art is much less satisfactorily developed. For 
example, in a drill bit or in a drillstring, vibration 
induced forces during operation can create severe 
unbalances. One technique used to counteract such 
imbalances is disclosed in U.S. Patent 4,905,776 (Beynet 
et al), and which includes the features in the pre-characterising 
part of each of the claims 1 and 10. Beynet et al teach a 
vibration dampening assembly with a plurality of annular 
grooves or races located about the periphery of the 
assembly and extending axially  
 
therealong. A plurality of balls or rollers are located 
in each of the races being all the same size and defines 
known prior art. Such balls or rollers are free to move 
along the races and thereby counteract the imbalance 
forces. A further similar structure is disclosed in U.S. 
Patent 4,674,356 (Kilgore). Kilgore teaches a plurality 
of balls freely movable in a race formed in an outer 
circumferential surface of the body which balls are used 
to counterbalance an imbalance in the rotating member. There are, however, disadvantages in such prior 
art. Although the Beynet et al reference is satisfactory 
to remove large imbalances from the rotating body, it is 
difficult to utilise the teachings of Beynet et al where 
the length of the balancing apparatus is necessarily 
restricted which is often the case. Likewise, while the 
teachings of Beynet et al are satisfactory to generally 
remove large imbalances from the drillstring,
