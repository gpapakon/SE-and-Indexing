<ABSTRACT>
A CRT work station (display work station, video work station), in particular in the control tower of an airport for monitoring the taxiing and air traffic on the ground and/or close to the ground, has a visual display unit (11) and a control console (13) placed in front of the latter, as well as a stand (10) for mounting the visual display unit and the control console in mutual assignment. For the ergonomically optimal configuration of the CRT work station while satisfying the requirement for change between direct visual monitoring with screen support and monitoring solely on the screen of the visual display unit, the visual display unit is suspended in the stand so as to be pivotable about a pivoting axis running close to its front lower transverse edge facing the control console, and parallel thereto, and the control console is adapted to be adjustable at least in height.
