<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to the leak testing of a cemented part of a pipe for detecting the technical tightness of the cement and of the pipework, using a gaseous testing medium. In order to exclude the disadvantageous influences on the measuring result which are caused by level changes of the applied bore hole liquid as a result of the compressibility of liquid and strata in the cavern, further exactly measured quantities of testing medium are introduced into the testing interval during the entire testing duration; the excess quantity remaining after compensating for the leakage losses is carried away and measured and, apart from the testing gas volume and the pressure changes, the difference from the additionally fed and carried away testing medium quantity is used in the calculation of the leakage rate. The facility according to the invention has an auxiliary casing string 3 with openings 4 for carrying away excess testing gas quantities 5 into a testing gas excess buffer 10, which is connected to measuring facilities 12;14;15 and to a liquid-gas separator 13. Apart from the compensation of the leakage losses, by means of the additional quantities of testing gas, a constant level 17 is set at the upper edge depth 19 of the openings 4 and distortions of the measuring result caused by level changes are excluded.

Process for the testing of density in cementations 
near the shoe casing of gas storage caverns in which a 

gaseous testing medium is used. The gas forces the 
brine or storage medium out of the testing space and 

is put under pressure. The density is determined after 
a predetermined testing period with the changes in 

pressure within the testing space recorded. These 
changes are determined on the basis of the amount of 

testing gas lost, whereby additional quantities of 
testing gas are pumped into the testing space during 

the testing period. The process is 
characterized by
 
the fact that an excess amount of testing medium is 

taken back up after compensation for the leakage. This 
volume is precisely measured and the difference 

between the amount added and the amount drawn off 
included in the calculation of the leakage rate.  

 
Process in accordance with claim 1, characterized by 
the additional introduction of precisely measured 

testing medium and constant introduction. 
Process in accordance with claim 1, characterized by 
the additional introduction of precisely measured 

testing medium and intermittent introduction. 
Process in accordance with claim 1, characterized by 
the additional introduction of precisely measured 

testing medium and single introduction at the end of 
the testing period. 
Equipment to conduct the process in accordance with 
one or more of the claims 1 to 4 with one of the 

cemented strings (1) equipped for the testing period 
with auxiliary string (3) with supply lines for the 

testing medium and pressure meters. The auxiliary 
string must be at least partially filled with fluid 

during the testing period and equipped with pressure 
meters and project into the storage fluid of the 

cavern. The equipment is characterized by the 
auxiliary strings (3) being equipped with means for 

introducing the testing medium in the auxiliary 
string (3) and a testing gas buffer (10) at the head 

of the uptake space (5) above the level of the fluid 
in the auxiliary string (3) connected to pressure and 

volume meters (12-15) 
Equipment in accordance with claim 5, characterized by 
the auxiliary string (3) equipped with flow holes (4) 

in the area of the contact between the gaseous testing 
medium volume and storage fluid (6). 
Equipment in accordance with claim 5, characterized by 
the auxiliary string (3) projecting into the storage 

fluid (6) at the expected level (17).  
 
Equipment in accordance with claim 5, characterized by 
the brine barrow tram functioning as the auxiliary 

string (3) equipped with caps to be controlled by 
wire-line technique in the contact area between the 

fluid (6) and the testing medium. 
Equipment in accordance with one of the claims 5 to 8, 
characterized by the head of the uptake space (5) 

being connected with volumeters (14,15) and preceded 
by a fluid-gas cutter. 
Equipment in accordance with one of the claims 5 to 9, 
characterized by the supply line (20) for the testing 

medium is equipped with a volumeter (9). 
Equipment in accordance with one of the claims 5 to 9, 
characterized by bottles for the testing medium (5) 

are connected to the supply line (20), whereby the 
pressure of the testing medium (5) in the bottles and 

the content of the bottles is precisely measured.
