<ABSTRACT>
The present invention relates to a process for providing  high definition printing for line art or four color process graphics including reproduction of photographs, on a towel, and involves providing a towel (10) which comprises one face (20) formed of a material able to receive printing by sublimation printing techniques and one face (30) formed of an absorbent material; providing printing on a backing sheet using sublimation inks; and transferring the printing from the backing sheet to the printing receiving face by sublimation of the sublimation inks. The invention also relates to the towel produced thereby.

<DESCRIPTION>
 PRINTED TOWEL AND PROCESSTechnical FieldThe present invention relates to a process for applying high quality printing to towels and like objects, especially beach towels or sports towels. The printing is of a high definition and can even comprise photographic reproductions. The invention also comprises the towels produced thereby.The production of brilliantly colored towels, especially beach towels or sports towels, has been widely, sought. Such items are extremely popular with consumers and are considered commercially very attractive. Current processes for producing printed towels use conventional silk screening techniques, which produce images of relatively low definition, and certainly nothing which has the definition of a photograph. Moreover, there was no known four color process printing (the meaning of which will be appar¬ ent to the skilled artisan) technique which would be effective for high quality photograph reproduction on a towel.In addition, reproduction of multi-colored images and graphics of any definition and quality onto towels was believed to require a border, such that the printing does not extend to the edge of the towel. This difficulty is caused by the fact that the inks or dyes required are considered hazardous for handling and disposal. The production of towels having printing without a border (referred to as full 

bleed printing), by current techniques, results in a great deal of waste dye which is difficult and expen¬ sive to dispose of according to current regulations.What is desired, therefore, is a process for producing a printed towel which avoids the disadvan¬ tages of the prior art and is capable of four color process photo reproduction printing. Preferably, the process also permits full bleed printing.Disclosure of InventionThe present invention relates to a process for the four color process printing on a towel or like object with sufficient definition to provide photo¬ graph reproduction quality and brilliance, while maintaining ample towel absorbency. The skilled artisan would be familiar with the term "photograph reproduction quality and brilliance", which is meant to encompass definition of sufficiently high quality such that no discernible dot pattern is apparent to the naked eye when viewed from twenty-four inches.The inventive process, in its preferred embodi¬ ment, utilizes a towel having an absorbent material on one face and a material which can act as a sub¬ strate for printing on another. The printing sub¬ strate face of the towel has applied to it

<CLAIMS>
What is claimed is:
1. A printed towel having two faces, a first face comprising a printing receiving face which comprises at least about 65% of a relatively non-absorbent material able to receive printing by sublimation printing techniques, having four color process print¬ ing applied thereon by sublimation of sublimation inks; and a second face comprising an absorbent mate¬ rial.
2. The towel of claim 1, wherein the printing re¬ ceiving face has a moisture regain of less than about 3%
3. The towel of claim 2, wherein the printing re¬ ceiving face of said towel is comprised of polyester.
4. The towel of claim 3, wherein said first face comprises at least about 90% polyester.
5. The towel of claim 1, wherein said printing is formed by photographic or lithographic techniques.
6. The towel of claim 1, wherein said towel is formed by providing a web of material having absor¬ bent material extending therefrom on one side thereof and printing receiving material extending therefrom or another side thereof.
7. The towel of claim 1, wherein the absorbent face 


of said towel has a net moisture regain of at least about 3.5%.
8. The towel of claim 7, wherein said absorbent material comprises cotton.
9. The towel of claim 1, wherein said printing com¬ prises lettering, images, or combinations thereof.
10. The towel of claim 9, wherein said printing is produced full bleed.
11. A printed towel having two faces, a first face comprising a print receiving face which comprises at least about 65% of a relatively non-absorbent materi¬ al having a moisture regain of less than about 3% and able to receive printing by sublimation printing techniques, said relatively non-absorbent material comprising polyester, wherein said printing receiving face has four color process printing applied thereon full bleed by sublimation of sublimation inks; and a second face comprising an absorbent face which com¬ prises an absorbent material comprising cotton.
12. A process for making a towel, comprising a) providing a towel having two faces, i. a first face comprising a printing receiving face which is comprised of at least about 65% of a relatively non-absorbent material able to receive printing by sublimation printing tech
¬
 niques; and 


ii. a second face comprising an absorbent face which is comprised of an absorbent material; b) providing printing on a backing sheet using sublimation inks; and c) transferring the printing from the backing sheet to the printing receiving face of said towel by sublimation of said sublimation inks.
13. The process of claim 12, wherein the printing receiving face of said towel material is comprised of polyester.
14. The process of claim 13, wherein said first face comprises 90% polyester.
15. The process of claim 12, wherein said printing is formed on said backing sheet by photographic or lithographic techniques.
16. The process of claim 12, wherein said towel material is formed by providing a web of material having absorbent material extending therefrom on one side thereof and printing receiving material extend- ing therefrom on another side thereof.
17. The process of claim 12, wherein the absorbent face of said towel material has a net moisture regain of at least about 3.5%.
18. The process of claim 16, wherein said absorbent material comprises cotton. 


19. The process of claim 12, wherein said printing comprises lettering, images, or combinations thereof.
20. The process of claim 19, wherein said printing is produced full bleed.
