<ABSTRACT>
An electric vehicle according to the present invention is provided with a driving motor (13) adapted to be 
driven by the electric power from a storage battery (11), an air-conditioner (1), and a regenerative brake means 

adapted to generate during the deceleration of a vehicle regenerative power by temporarily using the motor (13) as a 
generator, and charge to storage battery (11) with this power. This electric vehicle is further provided with a means 

(18) for determining a quantity of excessive regenerative power on the basis of the regenerative power generated 
by the regenerative brake means and a permissible quantity of regenerative power of the storage battery (11) at this 

point in time, and a means for distributing the excessive regenerative power on the basis of the quantity of excessive 

regenerative power. The increasing of the efficiency of the air-conditioner (1) and the saving of power can be attained 
by stopping the operation of the air-conditioner (1) after increasing the air-conditioning capacity with the excessive 

regenerative power, and by increasing the air-conditioning efficiency by accumulating the excessive regenerative power 
as heat in heat accumulating means (30, 34).

<DESCRIPTION>
Recently, electric motor vehicles are attracting
attention because they avoid various problems due to
the exhaust gas from internal combustion engines which are
used for gasoline automobiles. More specifically, carbon
dioxide which is contained in the exhaust gas form internal
combustion engines accumulates and concentrates in the atmosphere,
causing the greenhouse effect and air pollution
which are serious problems against the global environment.
As a next-generation vehicle which radically solves these
problems, electric motor vehicles using a drive motor which
does not produce exhaust gas are being put into practical
use and various proposals are being made.But, this drive source for the electric motor vehicles
is a motor which has a high efficiency but produces less 
heat. Therefore, its heat cannot be used for an air conditioning
system unlike enormous waste heat which is produced
by the operation of conventional internal combustion
engines. In view of this, a heat pump method is generally
adopted for the air conditioner of the electric motor
vehicle. When this air conditioner is operating, a low- or
high-temperature refrigerant which is used to heat or cool
the cabin is evaporated or condensed by conducting a heat
exchange with the open air by means of an exterior heat exchanger
and returned to a compressor, thus being circulated
within the system in the same way as a room air conditioner.In the electric motor vehicle, a regenerative brake
which uses the drive motor as a generator is generally used
in place of the engine brake of a conventional internal combustion
engine. In this case, kinetic energy, which must be
reduced when the electric motor vehicle decelerates or goes
down a slope, is partly converted into electrical energy by
temporarily using the drive motor as the generator, and this
electrical energy is recovered into a storage battery, thus
the drive motor provides a role of an auxiliary brake.For this type of electric motor vehicle, a lead storage
battery is generally used broadly in view of its cost and
good resource balance. But, the lead storage battery has
disadvantages that its performance is deteriorated and the 
service life is heavily ruined when the battery, which still
has a remaining capacity higher than a prescribed level, is
quickly recharged exceeding an appropriate charging current
for the battery by high regenerative electric power.For this reason, in the case of a conventional
regenerative brake, the gene rated regenerative electric
power is lowered to protect the lead
