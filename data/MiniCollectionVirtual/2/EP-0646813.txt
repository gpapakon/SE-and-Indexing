<ABSTRACT>
A V groove (14) and guide grooves (20) are defined 
in a ceramic substrate (12), and an optical fiber (16) 

is fixedly disposed in the V groove by the ceramic 
substrate and a cover (22), thereby producing a first 

optical waveguide chip. A V groove (34) and guide 
grooves (40) are also defined in another ceramic 

substrate (32), and an optical fiber (36) is fixedly 
disposed in the V groove by the ceramic substrate and a 

cover (42), thereby producing a second optical waveguide 
chip. The first optical waveguide chip has an end face 

(24) inclined to the direction of propagation of light 
through the optical fiber thereof, and the second 

optical waveguide chip also has an end face (44) 
inclined to the direction of propagation of light though 

the optical fiber thereof. The first and second optical 
waveguide chips are positioned relatively to each other 

by guide pins (50) intimately placed in the guide 
grooves, and the inclined end faces extend substantially 

parallel to each other with an air layer (62) interposed 
therebetween. Light is reflected out of the light 

guide from the inclined face. 
An optical component such as an optical 

transmission/reception module thus produced can easily 
be reduced in size and cost, and fabricated in an 

integrated configuration.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method of 
fabricating an optical component, and more particularly to a 
method of fabricating an optical transmission/reception 
module for use in optical CATV and optical communication 
fields. As the optical fiber transmission technology advances, 
various research activities are directed to optical 
CATV and optical communication systems which utilize the 
wide-band characteristics of the optical fibers. It is expected 
that there will be realized a Fiber-To-The-Home 
(FTTH) system which has optical fibers led to homes for 
starting various information services in the near future. 
For realizing a full-fledged FTTH system, it is necessary to 
reduce the size and cost of optical terminals connected to 
respective homes. The FTTH system requires a bidirectional optical 
transmission mode which needs to be performed by an optical 
reception/transmission module comprising a light source for 
emitting an optical signal, a light-detecting element for 
converting the optical signal into an electric signal, and 
an optical coupler for transmitting light from the optical 
source and light to the light-detecting element to optical  
 
fibers that are used to transmit light. FIG. 1 of the accompanying drawings schematically 
shows a conventional optical reception/transmission module 
A. As shown in FIG. 1, the optical reception/transmission 
module A comprises a laser diode 1, a photodiode 2, and an 
optical coupler 3. The optical coupler 3 comprises two 
optical fibers 4, 5 fused together. Therefore, it is 
difficult to reduce the length of the optical coupler 3. 
The optical coupler 3 and the laser diode 1, and the optical 
coupler 3 and the photodiode 2 are connected to each other 
by optical fibers through fused regions 6 thereof. 
Consequently, the optical reception/transmission module A is 
relatively long in its entirety. If a plurality of optical 
reception/transmission modules A are required, then since 
the individual optical reception/transmission modules A have 
to be arrayed horizontally or vertically, the space taken up 
by the optical reception/transmission modules A increases 
and the cost of the entire system also increases as the 
number of optical reception/transmission modules A 
increases. As described above, inasmuch as the optical 
coupler 3 is composed of the two optical fibers 4, 5 fused 
together and the optical reception/transmission module A is 
made up of three components, i.e., the laser diode 1, the 
photodiode 2, and the optical coupler 3, the
