<ABSTRACT>
A flashlight (10) has a switch housing in between the battery compartment and reflector. The neck of the switch housing holds a lamp support (58) at a central position within a reflector. An O-ring on the rear of the switch housing seals the battery compartment. The switch housing partially floats within the flashlight tube (12) to allow for a slight adjustment of the lamp (60) relative to the reflector to insure centering.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates primarily to 
flashlights. Various flashlight designs are known in the art. 
Flashlights include one or more dry cell batteries and in 
certain designs the batteries are arranged in series in a 
battery compartment of a barrel or tube which acts as a 
handle for the flashlight. Electrical energy from the 
batteries is generally conducted to a lamp or bulb at the 
front end of the flashlight through a switch mechanism 
positioned between the batteries and the lamp. In various flashlight designs, the lamp is 
supported within the flashlight by a holder or spacer 
within the barrel and extends into the flashlight 
reflector. For optimal performance, the lamp must be 
properly aligned with the reflector. However, due to 
manufacturing and assembly operations and tolerances, 
after manufacture of the flashlight is fully completed, 
the lamp may be permanently misaligned with the reflector, 
resulting in degraded performance. Such a flashlight is described in US-A-4 527 223 
on which the precharacterising portion of claim 1 is 
based. This comprises a main barrel housing batteries 
with a switch holder provided in the forward end. The 
switch holder incorporates a switch assembly which 
supports a forwardly extending lamp holder. The lamp 
holder supports a lamp at the centre of a reflector. In addition, since under certain conditions the 
batteries can leak, it is advantageous to seal the battery 
compartment of the flashlight. On the other hand, since 
batteries can also release gases, it is advantageous to 
vent the battery compartment without allowing ingress of 
moisture, contaminants, etc.  
 According to the present invention, there is 
provided a flashlight having a flashlight barrel, a switch 
housing with a forwardly extending neck for supporting a 
flashlight lamp, and a reflector for reflecting light from 
the lamp, characterised by means for radially adjusting 
the switch housing within the barrel. Thus, the switch housing partially floats within 
the flashlight barrel to allow for a slight adjustment of 
the lamp relative to the reflector, thereby ensuring 
centring of the lamp and the lamp filament to the 
reflector. The invention will be further described by way 
of example, with reference to the accompanying drawings, 
wherein similar reference characters denote similar 
elements throughout the several views, and in which:- 
Figure 1 is a section view of the present 
flashlight; Figure 2 is an enlarged section view of the 
switch and bulb holder assembly of the
