<ABSTRACT>
The gas burner has an injector (3) and a gas nozzle (4) arranged in front of the injector, the gas nozzle being provided with a main nozzle bore (5) and a subsidiary nozzle bore (6). Both nozzle bores are directed towards the injector, but the subsidiary nozzle bore at an angle ( alpha ) in relation to the injector axis. The main nozzle bore (5) is assigned a closure element (7) which closes the main nozzle bore when the burner is to be run at reduced output. Given a constant gas pressure, a reduced quantity of gas then flows out of the subsidiary nozzle bore (6), the pulse which is still high being compensated for by the inclination of this nozzle bore. This limits the rise of the air ratio in the case of a reduction in the output. Clocking of the closure element (7) enables the setting of intermediate output stages.

<CLAIMS>
Gas burner (1) with an injector (3) and a gas nozzle (4), which is
disposed in front of the injector and has a main nozzle bore (5) directed

towards the injector, characterised in that the gas nozzle (4) has at least
one auxiliary nozzle bore (6) directed towards the injector (3) which is

oriented at an angle (a) to the axis of the injector and has a cross-section

which is preferably smaller than that of the main nozzle bore (5) and that
a valve element (7), which is movable between an open and a closed

position, is associated with the main nozzle bore.
Gas burner as claimed in claim 1, characterised in that the injector (3)
has an air restrictor (13), which annularly shields the edge of its inlet

opening.
Gas burner as claimed in claim 1 or 2, characterised in that the valve
element (7) is movable cyclically between the open and the closed

position.
Gas burner as claimed in one of claims 1 to 3, characterised in that the
valve element (7) is arranged in the interior of the gas nozzle (4) and has

a peg (7) which is disposed on a guide body (9) provided with gas flow
openings (10).
Gas burner as claimed in claim 4, characterised in that the guide body is
movable against the action of a returned spring (12) into the closed

position of the peg (7) by an electromagnet (11) which is arranged
externally on the gas nozzle 4.
