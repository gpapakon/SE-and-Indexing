<ABSTRACT>
Covalent cross-linkages for two oligonucleotide strands or for first and second regions of a single oligonucleotide strand connect sugar moieties of nucleotides on the respective strands or the regions of the single strand. The cross-linkages are connected to at least one strand or region via a space-spanning group. The cross-linkage also can be connected to the other strand or other region via a space-spanning group or via an abasic site located on the other strand or other region.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention is directed to covalent cross-linkages
for oligonucleotides. The cross-linkages connect either two
oligonucleotide strands or different regions of a single
oligonucleotide strand via a space-spanning group that extends
from a sugar moiety on a nucleotide of the first strand or
strand region to a nucleotide on the other strand or strand
region.Several examples have been reported of cross-linking
between complementary oligonucleotides. The purpose of such
cross-linking often has been to disrupt the function of a
nucleic acid, primarily by cleavage of the target. It is known
to cross-link nucleic acids in a positionally uncontrolled
manner with UV exposure. However, Grineva, and Karpova, FEBS.,1973, 32, 351-355, appear to have been the first to covalently
cross-link complementary strands of oligonucleotides at a
specific site utilizing controlled chemistry. A nitrogen
mustard was attached to the 3' terminal ribose unit of an
oligonucleotide via an acetal linkage or to the 5' end of an
oligonucleotide via a phosphoramide linkage. On hybridization,
the reactive mustards covalently cross-linked to the complementary
strand via alkylation of the ternary heteroaromatic
nitrogen atom at the 7-position of guanine or adenine.
However, the alkylated base thus formed is a quaternary charged
species that is subject to rapid chemical degradation via 
imidazole ring opening followed by cleavage of the targeted
strand.Enzymes are known to remove alkylated bases from
nucleic acids. Indeed, such enzymatic removal is implicated in
DNA repair mechanisms. The destruction of a targeted alkylated
nucleic acid theoretically could be utilized for antimicrobial
or antitumor therapy. However, cross-linking alkylation
reactions and subsequent degradations are not desirable where
host cell viability is necessary.Summerton and Bartlett have proposed another type of
alkylated oligonucleotide wherein an Î±-bromomethylketone
attached to the 4-position of a cytidine nucleotide spans the
major groove and alkylates the 7-position of a complementary
guanine residue in a targeted strand. [See, J. Mol. Biol.,1978,122, 145-162; J. Theor. Biology,1979,78, 61-75; and
United States Patent 4,123,610]. As with the nitrogen mustards
noted above, this alkylation yields a charged species that
effects cleavage of the targeted nucleic acid strand following
alkylation.A further example of a covalent cross-linkage to the
7-position nitrogen of guanine is described by Meyer et. al.,
J. Am. Chem. Soc.,1989, 111, 8517. The authors attached an
