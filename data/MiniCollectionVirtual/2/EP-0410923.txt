<ABSTRACT>
The pump arrangement has a pump chamber (1) with an inlet 
opening (2) and a discharge opening (3) to which is 

connected a discharge pipe (4). The inlet opening (2) is 
placed at a higher level than the discharge opening (3). To 

the inlet opening (2) is connected an inlet pipe (9) which 
is taken down to a level in the liquid where the pressure 

head (H) is higher than the pressure head (h) of the pump 
arrangement. When the pump chamber (1) is filled with 

liquid, air is supplied through a pipe (6) from a blower 
(7), whereby the liquid is forced out through the discharge 

pipe (4). Then the pump arrangement is aired when a valve 
(8) opens, thus supplying new liquid to the pump 

arrangement. 
The pump arrangement has no valves and has therefore free 
throughput in the whole of its length. It can therefore pump 

liquid containing larger impurities such as plastics bags, 
rope ends, etc. without choking. 
The pump can also be used for cleaning waste water of 
sludge. The effect consumption is lower than in known pumps.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a pump arrangement of the 
kind described in the introduction to claim 1. Such pump arrangements are known e.g. from the description 
of Norwegian patent No. 4.100, French patents Nos. 806.643 
and 1.033.695 and U.S.A. patent No. 1.072.562. These known pumps all have a valve on the inlet side which 
closes when compressed air is blown into the pump chamber. It is the purpose of the present invention to describe a 
pump in which the said valve in the inlet can be omitted, 
thus making the pump more simple in its construction and 
more robust and dependable than known pumps. This is 
achieved by shaping the pump as shown in the characterizing 
part of claim 1. As the pump arrangement according to the invention is open 
during the whole throughput action it can also pump liquids 
containing large objects such as plastics bags, rope ends 
and the like. Furthermore, it can be used to pump water 
containing live fish. Claim 2 deals with an embodiment of the pump chamber of a 
pump arrangement according to the invention. Claim 3 deals with another embodiment of the pump chamber of 
a pump arrangement according to the invention. Claim 4 deals with a pump arrangement according to the 
invention in which the pump acts as a liquid pump. Claim 5 deals with a pump arrangement in which the pump 
preferably pumps sludge from a sludgy liquid. The invention will be explained in detail below with 
reference to the drawing in which 
fig 1 is a schematic embodiment of a pump arrangement 
according to the invention, and  
 fig. 2 is a schematic drawing of another embodiment of a 
pump arrangement according to the invention. As shown in the drawing a pump arrangement according to the 
invention has a pump chamber 1, with an inlet opening 2 and 
a discharge opening 3. To the discharge opening is connected 
a discharge pipe 4, preferably by a U-shaped bend 5. A 
supply pipe 6 for compressed air is connected to the top 
part of the pump chamber 1. By way of example the compressed 
air can be supplied from a blower 7 so that compressed air 
is pumped into the pump arrangement when a magnet valve 8 is 
closed. The pump arrangement is aired, when the valve 8 is 
open. The valve 8 can be activated in various ways, e.g. by 
a not shown level sensor in the discharge pipe 4. The pump 
arrangement can also be spring suspended and designed so 
that it can activate a not shown limit switch in a bottom 
position, when it is filled with liquid, and in a top 
position, when it is emptied of liquid. Connected

<CLAIMS>
Pump arrangement for pumping liquid by means of 
compressed air with a pump chamber (1), which is completely 

or partially immersed in the liquid, a discharge pipe (4), 
reaching from the bottom of the pump chamber and an inlet 

opening (2) , which connects the pump chamber (1) with the 
liquid, and a supply pipe (6) for compressed air, which is 

connected to the upper part of the pump chamber, and through 
which the pump chamber is alternately connected to a 

compressed-air source (7) and aired to the surrounding 
atmosphere, 
characterized
 by the discharge pipe 
(4) being connected to a discharge opening (3) at the bottom 

of the pump chamber (1), preferably by a U-shaped bend (5) 
and by the inlet opening (2) being connected to an inlet 

pipe (9) reaching from the inlet opening (2) down into the 
liquid to a level where the pressure head (H) is higher than 

the pressure head (h) of the pump arrangement, and which is 
preferably lower than the lowest part of the pump chamber, 

and by the bottom (10) of the inlet opening (2) being placed 
at a higher level than the discharge opening (3). 
Pump arrangement according to claim 1 
characterised
 
by the pump chamber (1) being embodied as an 

oblong, preferably cylindrical, pipe with an inclined 
orientation downwards from the inlet opening (2) towards the 

discharge opening (3). 
Pump arrangement according to claim 1, 
characterised
 
by the pump chamber (1) being embodied as an 

oblong, preferably cylindrical, pipe which is mainly of a 
horizontal orientation. 
Pump arrangement according to claims 1 and 3, 
characterised
 
by the lower edge (10) of the inlet 

opening (2) being placed at a higher level than the upper 
edge (12) of the horizontally oriented pump chamber (1). 
Pump arrangement according to claims 1 and 3, 
characterized
 
by the lower edge (10) of the inlet 

opening (2) being placed at a lower level than the upper 
edge (12), but at a higher level than the lower edge (13) of 

the pump chamber (1).
