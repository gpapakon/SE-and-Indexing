<ABSTRACT>
Loose and pourable granulates of valuable substances or mixtures of valuable substances are produced from their aqueous solutions and/or suspensions by spray drying or by fluidized bed spray granulation or the like with a stream of overheated gas within a drying reactor. Overheated steam is used as drying gas during one or several drying steps. The drying process is interrupted before the product is thermally damaged and if required the storage-stable looseness and pourability of the partially dried product are ensured by admixture of components capable of binding limited amounts of water and/or by a subsequent treatment. The system is a closed system in which a steam current circulates, from which the water evaporated from the process substance is drawn as a partial current and to which the released thermal energy is supplied again. The circulating steam current is cleared from entrained parts of the process substance by means of filters made of fabrics and/or felts. Optimized process features concern the circulation of steam.

A process for the production, more particularly the 
continuous production, of pourable and free flowing granules 

of useful materials or mixtures of useful materials, 
which are suitable for use as and/or in wetting agents, 

detergents and/or cleaning products, from aqueous solutions 
and/or suspensions 


a) by spray drying or fluidized bed spray granulation or 
the like in a drying vessel using a hot gas stream 
b) of superheated steam, 
 
characterized in that 


c) drying is terminated before the product can be damaged 
by heat, 
d) the long-term pourability and free flow of the product 
thus partly dried is optionally established by addition 

of mixture constituents capable of binding 
limited quantities of water and/or by an aftertreatment, 
e) the process is carried out in a closed-loop system 
with a steam circuit from which the water evaporated 

from the starting material is removed and the thermal 
energy released is returned and 
f) the circulating steam is freed from entrained particles 
of the starting material by means of filters, 

more particularly tube filters, consisting of woven 
fabrics and/or felts, preferably needle felt. 
A process as claimed in claim 1, characterized in that 
the filters and/or the clean gas zone are additionally 

heated. 
A process as claimed in claim 1 or 2, characterized in 
that the circulating steam is allowed to flow inwards 

through the tube filters which are exposed to surges of 
pressurized gas from inside, more particularly periodically, 

so that any particles of the starting material which 
have settled on the filters are removed.  

 
A process as claimed in claim 3, characterized in that 
superheated steam is used as the pressurized gas for 

cleaning the filters. 
A process as claimed in claims 1 to 4, characterized 
in that the steam is made to circulate upwards in counter-current 

to the material being dried and through the filters 
arranged in the upper part of the drying vessel. 
A process as claimed in claim 5, characterized in that 
the steam is guided through filters arranged vertically 

above the spraying zone or the fluidized bed.
