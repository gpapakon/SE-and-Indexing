<ABSTRACT>
A method for using a remotely positioned MRI device to 
image a material with an inhomogeneous magnetic field 

requires maintaining an encoded coherence of all components 
of nuclear magnetization in the material during the imaging 

process. To do this, the encoding of nuclei is 
accomplished first, and then the nuclei are repetitively 

refocussed to obtain recordable net magnetic moments. This 
is repeated as part of a two-step recording sequence 

wherein first one component of the refocused nuclear 
magnetization is recorded and then the other component of 

the refocussed nuclear magnetization is recorded. 
Importantly, for each step in the recording sequence the 

encoding and the repetitive refocussing of the nuclei are 
accomplish separately. Specifically the method includes 

the steps of: tilting the nuclei with a 90° pulse; encoding 
the nuclei with 
a gradient; pulsing the encoded nuclei with 
a train of 180° pulses having a first phase angle to 

generate a pattern of magnetic moments; and recording the 
pattern. All of this is then repeated using 180° pulses 

with a different phase angle. The method also contemplates 
combining a plurality of patterns to create an image of the 

material.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention pertains generally to magnetic
resonance imaging (MRI). More specifically, the present
invention pertains to remotely positionable MRI devices
which use an inhomogeneous magnetic field for imaging a
slice or plane of material inside an object. The present
invention is particularly, but not exclusively, useful for
the imaging of biological tissue.Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) is a well
known diagnostic procedure which is extensively used in the
medical field to noninvasively image internal biological
tissue. As is also well known, MRI relies on the nuclear
magnetic resonance (NMR) of nuclei, and the fact that when
tissue nuclei are placed in the environment of a strong
external magnetic field they will each assume a discrete
energy state. When considered together, it is the
statistical distribution of those energy states of the
atomic nuclei in a magnetic field that leads to a
macroscopic magnetic moment. Importantly for MRI, these
nuclear magnetic moments react to a particular radio
frequency (RF) radiation by specifically changing their
orientations.NMR takes advantage of the fact that while tissue
nuclei are in an external magnetic field, induced changes
in their energy states will generate signals which are
characteristic of the tissue. In particular, with
appropriate changes in orientation of the magnetic moments,
it is possible to generate spin echo signals. Not
surprisingly, many variables are involved in this process,
and importantly, they are interrelated. As indicated above, nuclei assume orientations in a
magnetic field which may be subsequently changed by RF
radiation. The RF radiation which is most effective for
inducing such a change has a particular frequency which
depends on the magnitude of the magnetic field at the
location of the nucleus. This particular frequency, more
familiarly known as the Larmor frequency, is equal to the
angular frequency of precession of the nucleus spin vector
about the direction of the magnetic field vector.
Generally stated, it is necessary to irradiate nuclei with
their particular Larmor frequency to induce rotations of
the net magnetic moment vector. Particularly important to
the present invention is the fact that RF pulses which
cause one hundred and eighty degree (180°) rotations of the
magnetic moment vectors are capable of generating spin echo
signals by refocussing a large number of magnetic moments
having a range of Larmor frequencies. This fact is of less
importance when NMR is conventionally performed using
nearly
