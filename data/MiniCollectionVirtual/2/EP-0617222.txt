<ABSTRACT>
An improved gas riser comprises a pipe nipple (60), casing 
(100), adaptor sleeve (70), tube (40), and stiffener (120). The 

adaptor sleeve features an internal stop which accurately positions 
an end of the plastic tube before the tube is plastically 

deformed into grooves (94) in an internal surface of the adaptor 
sleeve. Each of the first and second ends of the adaptor 

sleeve can be manufactured in different diameters to fit pipe 
nipples and casings that are required by different code regulations. 

The method of assembling the gas riser comprises inserting 
a first end of the adaptor sleeve (70) into a second end 

of a pipe nipple (60), inserting a second end of the adaptor 
sleeve into a first end of the casing (100), welding the second 

end of the pipe nipple and the first end of the casing to the 
adaptor sleeve, inserting a stiffener (120) into a tube end, 

inserting the tube end into the adaptor sleeve, pulling a mandrel 
through the assembly which plastically deforms the stiffener 

and forms a seal by urging the tube (40) into grooves (94) 
on an interior surface of the adaptor sleeve.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention is directed to a method of assembling a
metal pipe-to-plastic pipe connection. More particularly,
this invention relates to a method of assembling a gas riser
which is used to deliver natural gas from a main to a point
of use through plastic and metal conduits, tubes or pipes.Conventional gas risers comprise a metal casing
or pipe at one end and a plastic pipe or tube at the other
end. The metal pipe is typically connected to a delivery
member such as a gas meter manifold at a location above
ground. The plastic tube, on the other hand, is connected
to an underground service line which is oftentimes a
plastic pipe construction. The metal pipe and plastic tube
are joined together at a transition joint. For example in
a double walled riser, an outer metal pipe is provided at
locations above ground and surrounds the inner plastic
tube. The transition between the plastic tube and metal
pipe in the gas riser includes a seal, examples of such
structures including U.S. Patent Nos. 3,987,820 and
4,482,170.Different city and state government codes have
their own requirements regarding gas riser constructions.
These codes require different wall thicknesses and seal
constructions so that a gas riser manufacturer must provide
a wide variety of structural arrangements. From an
assembly standpoint, this requires a large amount of 
customized manufacturing in order to meet the different
code requirements. Therefore, it has been deemed desirable
to provide a gas riser structural arrangement that is
easily adapted to various code requirements.Still other prior art gas riser arrangements
provide alternative plastic-to-metal transition joints.
Some of these arrangements, though, are deemed to be more
difficult to assemble or omit more desired features since
the plastic necessitates such an arrangement. For example,
it is often desired to provide an epoxy coating on the
outer metal casing for corrosion protection. Preferably,
the entire length of the outer casing of the gas riser
would be coated with the epoxy in a single process step.
This would provide an end-to-end epoxy coated outer metal
casing that is less subject to corrosion problems, as
opposed to other coated casings that apply the epoxy in
multiple steps.Moreover, a preferred method of applying the
epoxy coating to the metal casing uses elevated
temperatures that could adversely affect any elastomer seal
or plastic pipe that may be contained in the casing if
necessary precautions or design alterations are not
undertaken to protect the elastomer

A method of assembling a metal pipe-to-plastic pipe connection
having a metal pipe nipple (60; 60'), a metal casing

(100; 100'), an adaptor sleeve (70; 70'), a plastic tube
(40; 40') and a stiffener (120; 120'), said method comprising

the steps of:

forming an outer casing (30) by

inserting a first end (72; 72') of said adaptor
sleeve (70; 70') into a second end (64; 64') of

the pipe nipple (60; 60'),
inserting a second end (76; 76') of said adaptor
sleeve (70; 70') into a first end (102; 102') of

the metal casing (100; 100'), and
securing the second end (64; 64') of the pipe
nipple (60; 60') and the first end (102; 102') of

the metal casing (100; 100') to the adaptor sleeve
(70; 70')
clamping the outer casing (30) in an assembly
apparatus;
inserting a rod (140) into the outer casing (30)
through the first end (62; 62') of said pipe nipple (60;

60');
sensing the location of the adaptor sleeve (70; 70');
positioning a plastic tube clamp adjacent a second end
(106) of the metal casing (100; 100') and moving the

rod (140) and the clamp simultaneously away from the
second end (106) of the metal casing (100; 100');
placing the stiffener (120; 120') on a mandrel (142;
150) and attaching the latter to the rod (140); 
slipping the plastic tube (40; 40') of predetermined
length over the mandrel (142; 150) and advancing it

into position on the stiffener (120; 120');
securing the plastic tube (40; 40') by the clamp;
advancing the rod (140) with the attached mandrel
(142; 150) through the plastic tube (40; 40'), the stiffener

(120; 120'), the adaptor sleeve (70; 70') and the pipe
nipple (60; 60'), thereby bringing the stiffener (120;

120') and the plastic tube end in a position adjacent
securing means on an inner surface of the adaptor

sleeve (70; 70'); whereby
the outer diameter of the mandrel (142; 150) being
greater than the inner diameter of the stiffener (120;

120'), the stiffener is permanently deformed and urges
the outer surface of the plastic tube end into sealing

engagement with the securing means on the inner surface
of the adaptor sleeve (70; 70').
The method of claim 1 wherein the location of the adaptor
sleeve is sensed by sensing an external groove

(84; 84') provided on the adaptor sleeve (70; 70').
The method of claim 1 or 2 wherein the securing means
comprises grooves (94; 94') on the inner surface of the

adaptor sleeve (70; 70').
The method of any of claims 1 to 3 comprising the
further step of positioning a seal ring (130; 130') over

the stiffener (120; 120') before placing the stiffener
on the mandrel (142; 150).
The method of any of claims 1 to 4 wherein
the mandrel (150) is a carrier member having a first end

(152) to receive the stiffener (120; 120') thereon and a
series of expanding surfaces (154, 156, 158) incrementally 

increasing in diameter from the first end (152) to
a second end (160) of the carrier member.
The method of claim 5 wherein the first end (152) of the
carrier member (mandrel 150) is provided with a threaded

member (162) removably connecting the carrier member to
the rod (140) and received in a T-shaped slot in the end

of the rod.
Use of the method steps of any of claims 1 to 6 for assembling
a gas riser.
