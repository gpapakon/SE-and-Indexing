<DESCRIPTION>
The practice of fruit thinning is a standard management procedure for the deciduous fruit
industry. Thinning is the removal, or prevention, of a part of the fruit crop before it matures on
the tree. The fruit itself may be targeted, or the blossoms which produce the fruit may be the
target of the thinning procedure. Fruit thinning is necessary since many fruit trees tend to
produce far too many blossoms each year. The excess of fruit blossoms and fruit often results in
produce which is too small to be marketable. Further, when the fruit density is too great on
portions of the fruit trees, the weight of the fruit may become too large to be supported by the
tree, and the entire branch, including its fruit, may be lost. Additionally, fruiting is an exhaustive
process to the tree, especially if the crop is heavy. Therefore, one advantage to fruit thinning is
to permit the tree to mature as large a crop as possible and yet conserve sufficient nutrients and
carbohydrates for good short and spur growth, leaf development, and flower-bud formation for
next year's crop. If the tree is permitted to mature an excessive crop, it becomes devitalized to
the point where it not only produces an inferior product, but it becomes increasingly susceptible
to disease and low-temperature injury.An additional problem pertains to certain types of fruit trees which have substantially
reduced fruit yields in alternate years. These biennial fruits have excessively large crops followed
by insufficient crops in alternate years. This pattern can be disrupted, and constant desirably-sized
crops can be obtained on a regular basis by proper thinning techniques. Apples are a very good
example of biennial fruits which respond favorably to appropriate thinning.There are three commonly-used methods for thinning fruit: mechanical, chemical, and
by hand. Each has its advantages and disadvantages. In practice, fruit thinning is generally done
by hand. Workers must go to each tree and remove sufficient fruit to provide satisfactory fruit
thinning. Hand labor is perhaps the most reliable, but it is expensive.Chemical thinning would be preferred from a cost standpoint, but environmental
concerns, as well as inconsistent results, are major drawbacks to existing chemical methods. The
inconsistent results include overthinning, underthinning, and foliage injury. The chemical thinning
procedures which have been used in the past, and which are currently in use, function through a
variety of mechanisms. Some chemicals are applied during bloom and work
