Device for cooling vehicle components having a coolant 
circuit (1), in which a first unit (3) to be cooled, a first 

heat exchanger (4) and a control device (7) are arranged, 
whereby the control device (7) controls at least the delivery 

rate of a coolant pump (6) and a fan (5) assigned to the first 
heat exchanger (4) on the basis of operating parameters, and 

in which, in the coolant circuit (1) parallel with the first 
heat exchanger (4), a bypass line (9), controllable by a valve 

(8), is provided in which a second heat exchanger (10), 
supplied with fresh air by means of a second fan (22) and used 

for heating purposes, is arranged,
characterised in that
 
the second heat exchanger (10) is supplied in addition by a 

second coolant circuit (2), in which at least one additional 
unit (19, 20) is arranged. 
Vehicle cooling circuit as claimed in claim 1,
characterised in that
 
a second coolant pump (21) is provided in the second coolant 

circuit (2). 
Vehicle cooling circuit as claimed in claim 1,
characterised in that
 
the delivery rate of the second coolant pump (21) and/or the 

second fan (22) is also controlled by the control device (7) 
in conjunction with operating parameters. 
Vehicle cooling circuit as claimed in claim 1,
characterised in that
  
 

the heated air from the second heat exchanger (10) can be 
discharged to the environment or used for the purpose of 

heating the passenger compartment as required. 
Vehicle cooling circuit as claimed in claim 1,
characterised in that
 
the first unit to be cooled is a fuel cell unit (3). 
Vehicle cooling circuit as claimed in claim 1,
characterised in that
 
the first unit to be cooled is a water/water heat exchanger 

(27), which is additionally supplied by a third coolant 
circuit (26) flowing through the fuel cell unit (3). 
Vehicle cooling circuit as claimed in claim 5 or 6,
characterised in that
 
an electric motor (19) with its assigned power supply (20) is 

arranged in the second coolant circuit (2). 
Vehicle cooling circuit as claimed in claim 5 or 6,
characterised in that
 
provided in the first coolant circuit (1) parallel with the 

unit (3) to be cooled is a fourth bypass line (15) in which 
the drive unit (16) of a compressor is provided for delivering 

air to the fuel cell unit (3) and/or a third heat exchanger 
(17) for cooling the air delivered to the fuel cell unit (3).
