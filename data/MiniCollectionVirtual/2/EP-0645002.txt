<DESCRIPTION>
The US Government has certain rights in this invention pursuant to the terms of a 
Contract DAAL01-85-C-0153. The invention relates to the field of microstructure infrared radiation detector 
elements. Good thermal isolation of infrared radiation detector elements is required to 
maximise performance. The thermal isolation provided by the long detector support legs is 
presently limited because the relatively long legs must be thick enough to not break during 
turbulent liquid anisotropic etch of the pit in the silicon substrate beneath the detector, as 
well as thick enough to maintain the detector suspended out of contact with the substrate 
during and after the anisotropic etch. The present invention provides a process for fabricating a thermal isolation 
microbridge used as an infrared radiation detection element, the steps comprising: providing 
a monocrystalline silicon substrate wafer having a planar surface; depositing a thin film 
silicon nitride layer on said surface; depositing and delineating a thin film layer of 
temperature-sensitive, electrically-resistive material for a sensor and electrode leadout on 
said silicon nitride layer; depositing a further thin film silicon nitride layer over said material and 
said first silicon nitride layer; depositing a thin absorber layer over the last deposited silicon 
nitride in the area of the sensor; depositing and delineating a thin film photo-lithographic 
mask; making a plurality of silicon nitride cuts outlining elongated legs containing the 
electrode leadout and the support tabs for the microbridge; dry etching the legs and the 
support tabs to remove about 1/2 the thickness of silicon nitride; introducing anisotropic 
etchant through said cuts and anisotropically etching away silicon to form a pit beneath the 
microbridge sensor legs; removing the thin film photolithographic mask with a liquid etch;  
 
etching with a plasma dry etch the exposed silicon nitride on said elongated legs to remove 
the Si3N4 of the leg extending laterally of the electrode so as to remove the support tabs. Figure 1 shows a plan view of the microbridge infrared radiation detector element 
according to the invention. Figure 1a shows a cross section of the completed support leg for the microbridge 
element. Figure 2 shows an edge view of the structure Figure 1. Figure 3 shows the plan view at an intermediate point in the process before tab 
removal, and before the support legs are made narrower and thinner by the final dry etch.

A process for fabricating a thermal isolation microbridge used as an infrared 
radiation detection element, the steps comprising: 


providing a monocrystalline silicon substrate wafer (11) having a planar surface; 
depositing a thin film silicon nitride layer (12) on said surface; 
depositing and delineating a thin film layer (14) of temperature-sensitive, electrically-resistive 
material for a sensor and electrode leadout on said silicon nitride layer; 
depositing a further thin film silicon nitride layer (13) over said material and said silicon 
nitride layer; 
depositing a thin absorber layer (16) over the last deposited silicon nitride in the area 
of the sensor; 
depositing and delineating a thin film photo-lithographic mask (60), 
making a plurality of silicon nitride cuts (40, 50) outlining elongated legs (20, 21) 
containing the electrode leadout and the support tabs for the microbridge; 
dry etching the legs and the support tabs to remove about 1/2 the thickness of silicon 
nitride; 
introducing anisotropic etchant through said cuts and anisotropically etching away 
silicon to form a pit beneath the microbridge sensor legs; 
removing the thin film photolithographic mask with a liquid etch; 
etching with a plasma dry etch the exposed silicon nitride on said elongated legs to 
remove the Si

support tabs. 
A process according to Claim 1 and directly following said step "depositing a 
thin absorber layer over the last deposited silicon nitride in the area of the sensor", further 

comprising the step:
 
   covering said absorber layer with a thin film layer of silicon nitride. 
A process according to Claim 1 or 2 in which said temperature sensitive 
electrically-resistive material is nickel-iron. 
A process according to any preceding Claim in which said absorber layer is a 
thin film layer of nickel-iron. 
A process according to any preceding Claim in which said photolithographic 
mask is chrome metal. 
A process according to any preceding Claim comprising etching with a plasma 
dry etch the exposed silicon nitride on said elongated legs to remove the Si
