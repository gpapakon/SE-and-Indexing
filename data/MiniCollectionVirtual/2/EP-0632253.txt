<ABSTRACT>
The rotor of a rotary position sensor mounts directly 
upon the rotary shaft to be sensed. The rotor prior to 

installation is retained in position by a pair of small 
protrusions extending from the rotor that cooperatively 

engage a pair of small indentations formed in a pair of 
supporting arms. During the installation process, the 

rotor is slipped onto the shaft and the protrusions are 
released from the engaged position. During operation of 

the position sensor, the rotor is free from direct contact 
with either the supporting arms or any other stationary 

part of the position sensor. Only the contactors engage 
the stationary components. This design eliminates the 

need for bearings and return springs prevalent in the 
prior art.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates generally to position
sensors and more especially but not exclusively to a
variable resistor position sensor, for example as used in
connection with throttle valves for internal combustion
engines.Many internal combustion engines use a
throttle valve to control the amount of air entering the
engine. This throttle valve is often called a butterfly or
throttle flap, and is used in gasoline, diesel and other
alternatively fuelled vehides. The throttle valve may
either be opened to provide unimpeded air intake
through a throttle body or may be closed more or less to
restrict the passage of air. By controlling the amount of
air that reaches the combustion chamber, the throttle
valve forms part of the primary engine speed control.
The throttle valve may therefore be mechanically linked
to the accelerator pedal or, in some instances, linked
thereto through a combination of electrical and mechanical
interconnections.Many efforts are being made to improve the
efficiency of internal combustion engines and similarly
to reduce the emissions, or pollutants, that are produced
by these engines. A vital part of better efficiency
and reduced emissions is the electronic control circuitry
used with the engines. The electronic circuitry monitors
various engine parameters and provides feedback to
control the engine. The feedback may be a signal which
in some way improves efficiency or reduces emissions.
The signal may, for example, be used to control the
amount of fuel injected into the engine or the timing of
ignition.A potentiometer is often used to sense the
position of the throttle valve. This potentiometer is in
some ways similar to volume controls used in radio and
television receivers. A voltage is applied across two
extreme ends of a resistor, and an intermediate tap is
mechanically linked to the device which is to be sensed,
the position of the device being determined by the voltage
at the intermediate tap.There exist several stringent requirements
placed upon a throttle position sensor that make it different
from a volume control. Since the throttle valve is
used to control air intake and thereby represent a
demand for power, binding of the throttle shaft in an
open throttle position could result in life threatening situations.
Safety and reliability are essential in automotive
applications.The automotive environmental requirements
are also different from a radio or television receiver. The
throttle position sensor must reside against the throttle
body. Thus, environmental temperatures

A rotary position sensor for coupling to a device including a
rotary component, said sensor comprising:


a stator for attachment to a body part of said device;
a rotor (200) for attachment to said rotary component so as to be
rotatable therewith relative to the stator;

rotor (200) for enabling an electrical representation to be obtained of the

angular position of the rotor (200) relative to the stator ; and
cooperating formations (134, 136, 210, 212) provided on said rotor (200)

rotary component for support; 
characterised in that

during installation the cooperation between said formations 

(134, 136, 210, 212) is negated by
causing a small amount of relative rotation between the rotor (200) and

the stator so as to separate the formations (134, 136,
