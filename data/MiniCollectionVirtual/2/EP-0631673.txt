<ABSTRACT>
A process control interface system (10) having a network of distributed triply redundant input/output field computer units (12). The system includes a plurality of self-contained remotely located triply redundant field computer units (12) connected to decision making redundant process control computers (14) through a bi-directional communication network having at least two concurrently active communication channels (46, 48). Each of the field computer units include a set of at least three redundant field computers (92, 94, 96) for arbitrating both input and output signals. The field computer units also include individual abort circuits (510, 606) for each output signal to be transmitted to a device (84, 86) which affects the operation of the physical process. These abort circuits effectively enforce the output value signals arbitrated independently through each of the three redundant field computers using a voting procedure.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a computer unit according to the
preamble part of claim 1 or/and claim 2, said computer unit having a set of at
least three redundant computers. The present invention further relates to a
corresponding method of at least triply redundant computer control according
to the preamble part of claim 15 or/and 16, the method comprising at least
three simultaneously performed control cycles.One of the most difficult and elusive goals to achieve in the design of
any automated process control system is to provide an accurate, fast and yet
highly reliable control system which is capable of withstanding the rugged
demands of controlling a physical process non-stop for years at a time, if
possible. This is particularly true for the process control applications in a
chemical plant where the cost of shutting down a complex large-scale process
for computer system repairs may be enormous due to the time, effor and
waste incurred in attempting to bring such a process back on line.In order to achieve maximum economic efficiency and optimum product
quality, the demands for more comprehensive product control automation have
continued to increase in both quantity and sophistication. As the reliance on
computer-based control for the operation of a chemical process increases, it
is clear that a number of computers are required to work together in order to
accomplish all of the desired control tasks. This, of course, adds further
complexity to a control system for which maximum fault tolerance is desired.In order to increase the reliability of a process control computer system,
many attempts have been made to provide a backup computer for one or more
of the computers being used to actively control the process. However, a rapid
hand-off of control from an active computer to a backup computer is difficult
to achieve if the goal is to provide a seamless or transparent transfer to the
devices which affect the operation of the physical process. Additionally, the
conditions under which a transfer of control should be made may be complex
and consume needed processor time during normal operations. Another approach to this problem is to provide triple redundancy with
three actively operating computers. While the provision of three computer
processors certainly increases the overall cost of the control system, it does
permit the use of "majority voting" for decision making. The benefit of
majority voting not only adds to the ability of the computer system to
withstand a fault in one of the computers, it
