<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a lock-assembly system consisting of lock cylinders and of keys, with a ranking of the keys into individual keys and overriding keys, such as group keys, general master keys or those with a central-lock function, the said ranking being formed via profiled grooves of the key and associated ribs of the lock-cylinder keyway, the overriding key leaving free spaces (F) in the inserted state as a result of a differing cross-sectional shape of its profiled grooves from the insertion profile of the keyway, and proposes, in addition to high variability and optimum key guidance, that the free spaces (F) be laterally adjacent to a respective web-shaped rib (20) of the keyway, which rib (20) projects into the bottom (12) of the profiled grooves, comes to bear there relative to the key for guidance purposes and is narrowed in relation to the cross-section of the profiled grooves of the overriding key.
