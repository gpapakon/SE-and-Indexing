<ABSTRACT>
A water-dispersible tablet comprising 2-amino-2-(4-methylpiperazin-1-yl)-5-(2,3,5-trichlorophenyl)pyrimidine together with a swellable clay disintegrating agent and a further disintegrating agent. The tablet can be used in the treatment of neurodegenerative and other neurological disorders of the central nervous system, the actiology of which includes excessive release of neurotransmitter glutamate, including Alzheimers disease, cerebral ischaemic damage, chronic pain and epilepsy.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a water-dispersible tablet formulation containing 4-amino-2-(4-methylpiperazin-1-yl)-5-(2,3,5-trichlorophenyl)pyrimidine.European Patent Specification No. 372934 discloses the compound 4-amino-2-(4-methylpiperazin-1-yl)-5-(2,3,5-trichlorophenyl)-pyrimidine
(hereinafter referred to as
"AMTP") and their use in the treatment of neurodegenerative and other neurological
disorders of the central nervous system, the aetiology of which includes excessive release
of neurotransmitter glutamate, including Alzheimer's disease, cerebral ischaemic damage,
chronic pain and epilepsy.In order to be able to administer AMTP to patients to achieve the optimum therapeutic
benefit from the drug, it would be desirable to present the drug in a pharmaceutical
formulation that is capable of rapid dispersion in water.Following extensive research and investigation, we have now discovered a tablet
formulation for AMTP that is capable of rapid dispersion in water.According to one aspect of the present invention there is provided a water-dispersible
tablet comprising within the granules of the tablet AMTP together with a pharmaceutically
acceptable swellable clay disintegrating agent to provide a tablet which is capable of
dispersing in water within a period of 3 minutes to provide a dispersion which is capable
of passing through a sieve screen with a mesh aperture of 710µm in accordance with the
test for dispersible tablets defined in the British Pharmacopoeia, 1988, Volume II, page
895.According to a further aspect of the present invention there is provided a water-dispersible
tablet comprising within the granules of the tablet AMTP together with a pharmaceutically
acceptable swellable clay disintegrating agent and a further pharmaceutically acceptable
disintegrating agent to provide a tablet which is capable of dispersing in water within a
period of 3 minutes to provide a dispersion which is capable of passing through a sieve
screen with a mesh aperture of 710µm in accordance with the test for dispersible tablets 
defined in the British Pharmacopoeia, 1988, Volume II, page 895.The above-mentioned test for dispersion time is carried out using the following apparatus
and method:-(a) A rigid basket-rack assembly supporting six cylindrical glass tubes 75.0 to 80.0mm
long, 21.5mm in internal diameter and with a wall thickness of about 2mm.(b) A cylindrical disc for each tube, each 20.55 to 20.85mm in diameter and 9.35 to
9.65mm thick, made of transparent plastic with a relative density of 1.18 to 1.20,

further disintegrating agent which comprises bringing AMTP into association

with the said swellable clay and further disintegrating agent in the formation of
tablet granules to provide a
 water-dispersible tablet which is capable of dispersing
in water within a period of 3 minutes to provide a dispersion which is capable of
