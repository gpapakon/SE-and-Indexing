<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to squarylium dyes, and processes and 
intermediates for the preparation thereof. More specifically, it relates to such dyes 
and intermediates in which the squarylium ring bears a nitrogen or carbon containing 
group, and to certain intermediates useful for the preparation of the aforementioned 
dyes. It is known that compounds in which two chromophoric groups are 
linked by a pentamethine chain, the three central carbon atoms of which form part 
of a squarylium ring, are useful as dyes, especially near infrared dyes. (The term 
"near infra-red" is used herein to mean electromagnetic radiation having a 
wavelength of about 700 to about 1200 nm.) The term "chromophoric group" is used herein to mean a group 
containing a plurality of conjugated unsaturated linkages arranged so that the 
unsaturated linkages are conjugated with the squarylium ring via the unsaturated (sp2) 
meso carbon atom lying between the chromophoric group and the squarylium ring, 
the chromophoric group being such that the squarylium dye has substantial 
absorption of visible or infra-red radiation. For example, Japanese Patent Application No. 103,604/82 (Publication 
No. 220,143/83, published December 21, 1983), discloses a broad class of 
bis-heterocyclic pentamethine dyes in which the central three carbon atoms of the 
pentamethine chain form part of a squarylium or croconylium ring. The heterocyclic 
nuclei can be pyrylium, thiopyrylium, selenopyrylium, benzpyrylium, benzthiopyrylium, 
benzselenopyrylium, naphthopyrylium, naphthothiopyrylium or naphthoselenopyrylium 
nuclei, which can be substituted with alkyl, alkoxy, aryl or styryl 
groups. Japanese Patent Application No. 60-8730 (Publication No. 167,681/86, 
published July 29, 1986), discloses bis(4-benz[b]thiopyrylium) pentamethine dyes in 
which the central three carbon atoms of the pentamethine chain form part of a 
squarylium ring. The dyes are intended for use as infra-red absorbers.  
 U.S. Patent No. 4,508,811, issued April 2, 1985, describes an optical 
recording element in which the recording layer comprises a bis(2,6-dialkyl)-pyrylium 
or -thiopyrylium squarylium salt. The squarylium dyes disclosed in these Japanese applications and U.S. 
patent are capable of achieving high extinction coefficients in the near infra-red 
range. However, such squarylium dyes suffer from a number of disadvantages. 
Many of these prior art dyes have low solubility in most plastics and/or in semi-polar 
solvents (for example, methyl ethyl ketone and methylene
