<ABSTRACT>
A fishing lure (20) including an elongate body (22) which has a minnow head simulating portion (36) and an enclosed weight receiving cavity and weight therein, a spoon portion (38) having a downward directed convex surface and an upward directed concave surface (52) nested therein, and a conical transition surface (40) connecting the upward directed side (44) of the head (36) to the concave surface (52) of the spoon portion (38) along with a fish hook (26) adjacent the spoon portion (38) of the body (22). The hook (26) may be rigid and have a weedless feature (34), or be a treble hook on a split ring. The lure (20) has a rolling oscillation when pulled through the water and orients itself head down (36) and hook (26) upward when allowed to drop through the water.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to fishing lures, and in
particular, fishing lures which sink. Most particularly, the
present invention relates to weighted fishing lures which have
a predatory fish attracting motion when pulled through the
water and orient themselves in a particular manner when allowed
to sink.Fishing with natural live bait, such as minnows, has been
practiced since ancient times. The effectiveness of a minnow
on a hook in attracting and hooking predatory game fish, even
in the presence of schools of wild minnows, is presumably due
to the appearance of vulnerability associated with the bait
minnow. That is, to the predatory fish, the bait minnow
appears as a food source requiring relatively lower energy
output than a healthy wild minnow. In modern times, fishermen
have increasingly turned to artificial lures since artificial
lures are more convenient than natural live bait and avoid the
potential for disease transmission into the fish population.
A challenge to the fishing lure industry has been to mirror
and/or exceed the effectiveness of natural live bait such as
minnows.Fishing lures which are weighted so as to cause them to
sink through the water are well known. Three examples of
representative sinking lures are as follows: First, a jig-type
lure, which in its most basic form consists of a lead weight
molded onto the shank of a hook adjacent the eye of the hook.
Jig-type lures often are characterized by a tendency to drop
though water in an orientation such that the lead weight
portion of the lure leads the lure downward. Second, a metal
spoon-type lure which typically consists of a single piece of
metal sheet stamped into a bowl shape and having a treble hook
at one edge and an eyelet at an opposite edge. Spoon-type
lures often include a slight asymmetric characteristic in the
stamping which results in a helical motion when pulled through
water. Third, a full-bodied lure having an overall density
such that it sinks through the water. Some well known full-bodied
sinking lures simulate the shape of a minnow and may 
also wiggle slightly when pulled through the water if a forward mounted blade
surface is present, such as the lure of US-A-5133146.Although such prior art sinking lures have been effectively used to
catch fish, there remains an as yet unsatisfied need within the fishing sport
to provide sinking lures which are characterized by motions which simulate a
particularly vulnerable bait fish and, at the same time, retain much of the
appearance of a bait fish. If certain key

<CLAIMS>
A fishing lure comprising:

an elongate body (22) including:
a proximally positioned minnow head stimulating, portion (36), the head
portion having an upward directed side (44), a downward directed side (46), a

dorsal portion (42) and a ventral portion;
line connecting means (24) provided adjacent the minnow head portion
(36) of the elongate body (22); and
fish hooking means (26) provided distally on the elongate body (22)
characterised in that the lure further comprises means for generating an

oscillatory rolling motion of from about 90 to about 180 degrees rotation about
a longitudinal axis of the lure in response to proximally directed motion of the

body through water.
The device of claim 1 wherein the means for generating a rolling
oscillatory motion includes a spoon portion (38) having a concave surface (52)

and a convex surface (54), the concave surface (52) being shallower than the
convex surface (54).
The device of claim 1 and further including a weight (70) enclosed
within the minnow head portion (36) of the elongate body (22).
The device of claim 3 wherein the weight (70) includes means (80) for
anchoring the line connecting means (24). 
The device of claim 3 wherein the weight (70) includes means (88) for
anchoring the fish hooking means (26).
The device of claim 3 and further including a weed guard (34), wherein
the weight (70) includes means (80) for anchoring the weed guard (34).
The device of claim 2 and further including a transition surface (40)
connecting the upward directed side (44) of the head to the concave surface

(52) of the spoon portion (38), wherein the transition surface (40) includes a
generally conical surface defined by an apex (60) situated proximate the

concave surface (52) of the spoon portion (38).
