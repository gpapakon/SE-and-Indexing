<ABSTRACT>
A mounting device, in particular for a bulb on a headlamp, comprises:     on a casing (110) of the bulb, an arrangement including at least one lug and, below it, a space of a first width, the said lug carrying a locking tooth (151) opposite the said space, the said lug and the free space being oriented along a mounting direction, on a casing of the headlamp, a housing having a second width which is substantially equal to the overall width of the said arrangement and bounded by two generally parallel parts (11a, 11b) of the casing, one of which defines a retention edge which can interact with the tooth, also on the casing of the headlamp, a mobile arm (13) having substantially the said first width, to be engaged in the space so as to prevent the said tooth from disengaging from the said retention edge.

Device for mounting a first motor vehicle lighting or signaling device on a 
second lighting or signaling device, characterized in that it comprises: 


on a casing (110) of the first device, a fitting (150) including at least one lug (150a) 
and, underneath the said lug (150a), a free space of a first width, the said lug (150a) 

carrying a locking tooth (151) directed in the opposite direction to the said free 
space, the said lug (150a) and the free space being oriented in a direction of 

mounting the first device on the second, 
on a casing (10) of the second device, a housing (12) having a second width greater 
than the said first width and substantially equal to the overall width, encompassing 

the said lug (150a) and the said free space of the said fitting (150), and delimited by 
two parts (11a, 11b) parallel overall to the said casing, one (11a) of which defines a 

stop edge suitable for cooperating with the said tooth (151), 
also on the casing (10) of the second device, a movable arm (13) having a width 
substantially equal to the said first width and suitable for being selectively engaged 

in the said free space after engagement of the said fitting (150) in the said housing 
(12) so as to prevent the said tooth (151) for coming out of engagement with the 

said stop edge (11a). 
Device according to Claim 1, characterized in that the said fitting (150) 
comprises a means (152) for securing the engagement of the said arm in the said 

free space. 
Device according to Claim 2, characterized in that the said securing means 
comprises a protrusion (152) formed on a surface of the said fitting turned towards 

the said free space.  
 
Device according to one of Claims 1 to 3, characterized in that the said arm 
(13) is produced in one piece with the casing of the second lighting or signaling 

device and is hinged on the said casing by means of a film hinge (13b) in the vicinity 
of the said housing (12). 
Device according to one of Claims 1 to 4, characterized in that the said fitting 
comprises a double U-shaped lug (150) projecting laterally from a lateral face 

(110a) of the said casing. 
Device according to Claim 5, characterized in that at least one of the lugs 
(150a, 150b) of the double U-shaped lug is connected to the said lateral face (110a) 

solely on a part of its length opposite to a free end. 
Device according to one of Claims 1 to 6, characterized in that the said 
mounting direction is a direction horizontal overall from the outside towards the 

inside, and in that the said housing (12) is oriented horizontally and open in the 

direction of the first lighting or signaling device so as not to cause an obstacle to a 
certain amount of pivoting of the said fitting (150) in the said housing after locking, 

and therefore of the first lighting or signalling device with respect to the second, 
about an essentially vertical axis. 
Device according to Claim 7, characterized in that the said arm (13) is hinged 
so as to rotate about an essentially vertical axis. 
Device according to one of Claims 7 and 8, characterized in that it comprises 
additional mounting means (140a, 140b) also allowing a certain amount of pivoting 

of the first lighting or signalling device with respect to the second, about an 
essentially vertical axis. 
Device according to Claim 9, characterized in that the said additional 
mounting means comprise at least one tongue (140a, 140b) formed on the casing  

 
(110) of one of the lighting or signaling devices, oriented in the direction of 

mounting and suitable for engaging in a passage formed in the casing of the other 
lighting or signalling device, the tongue and the passage having substantially the 

same height but the tongue having a horizontal width less than the width of the 
passage. 
Lighting or signalling device (F) for a motor vehicle, characterized in that, in 
order to produce a mounting device according to one of the preceding claims, it 

comprises, on a casing (110), a fitting (150) including at least one lug (150a) and, 
underneath the said lug (150a), a free space of predetermined width, the said lug 

(150a) carrying a locking tooth (151) directed in the opposite direction to the said 
free space, and in that the said lug (150a) and the said free space are oriented in a 

direction of mounting of the device. 
Device according to Claim 11, characterized in that the said fitting (150) 
comprises a retaining member (152) extending in the said free space. 
Device according to Claim 11 or 12, characterized in that the said fitting 
comprises a double U-shaped lug (150) projecting laterally from a lateral face 

(110a) of the said casing. 
Device according to Claim 13, characterized in that at least one of the lugs 
(150a, 150b) of the double U-shaped lug is connected to the said lateral face (110a) 

solely on a part of its length opposite to a free end. 
Device according to one of Claims 11 to 14, characterized in that it also 
comprises, on its casing (110), at least one additional mounting member (140a, 

140b) oriented in the direction of mounting of the said device. 
Lighting or signalling device (P) for a motor vehicle, characterized in that, in 
order to produce a mounting device according to one of the preceding claims, it  

 
comprises, on a casing (10), a housing (12) having a predetermined width and 

delimited by two roughly parallel parts (11a, 11b) of the said casing, one of which 
(11a) defines a stop edge, and a movable arm (13) having a width substantially less 

than the said predetermined width and suitable for being selectively positioned in 
line with the said housing. 
Device according to Claim 16, characterized in that the said arm (13) is 
produced in one piece with the casing and is hinged on it by means of a film hinge 

(13b) in the vicinity of the said housing (12). 
Device according to Claim 17, characterized in that the said arm (13) is 
hinged so as to rotate about an essentially vertical axis. 
Device according to one of Claims 16 to 18, characterized in that it also 
comprises, on its casing (10), at least one additional mounting member oriented in 

an overall direction of the housing (12).
