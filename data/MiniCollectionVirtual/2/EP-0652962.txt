<ABSTRACT>
The invention provides a DNA molecule comprising a promoter sequence operably linked to a DNA sequence encoding first and second proteins linked by a hinge region wherein in that the promoter sequence can be one having activity which is induced in response to a change in the surrounding environment and the first protein can be Tetanus toxin C fragment or one or more epitopes thereof. The invention also provides intermediate molecules having a promoter operably linked to a DNA sequence encoding a first antigenic sequence and a hinge region, and at or adjacent the 3'-end thereof one or more restriction sites for the introduction of a second antigenic sequence. In addition, the invention provides replicable expression vectors containing the DNA fusion proteins expressed therefrom, bacterial transformed with the vectors and the use of the bacteria, in vaccines.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to vaccine compositions containing
attenuated
bacteria.In recent years, there has emerged a new generation of
live oral salmonella vaccines based upon strains of
Salmonella which have been attenuated by the introduction
of a non-reverting mutation in a gene in the aromatic
biosynthetic pathway of the bacterium. Such strains are
disclosed, for example, in EP-A-0322237. The aforesaid
live oral salmonella vaccines are showing promise as
vaccines for salmonellosis in man and animals, and they can
also be used effectively as carriers for the delivery of
heterologous antigens to the immune system. Combined
salmonella vaccines have been used to deliver antigens from
viruses, bacteria, and parasites, eliciting secretory,
humoral and cell-mediated immune responses to the
recombinant antigens. Combined salmonella vaccines show
great potential as single dose oral multivaccine delivery
systems [C, Hormaeche et al, FEMS Symposium No. 63, Plenum, 
New York; pp 71-83, 1992].There are problems to be overcome in the development
of combined salmonella vaccines. A major consideration is
obtaining a high level of expression of the recombinant
antigen in the salmonella vaccine so that it will be
sufficient to trigger an immune response. However,
unregulated high level expression of foreign antigens can
be toxic and affect cell viability [I. Charles and G.
Dougan, TIBTECH 8, pp 117-21, 1990], rendering the vaccine
ineffective or causing loss of the recombinant DNA.
Several possible solutions to this problem have been
described, such as expression from plasmids carrying
essential genes, "on-off" promoters or incorporation of the
foreign genes into the salmonella chromosome.An alternative approach to overcoming the aforesaid
problem would be to use a promoter which is inducible in
vivo, and one such promoter is the E.coli nitrite reductase
promoter nirB which is induced under anaerobiosis and has
been used in biotechnology for the production of tetanus
toxin fragment C (TetC) of Clostridium tetani [M.D. Oxer et
al Nucl. Ac. Res., 19, pp 2889-92, 1991]. It has
previously been found by the inventors of this application
(S.N. Chatfield et al Bio/Technology, Vol. 10, pp 888-92
1992) that an Aro Salmonella harbouring a construct
expressing TetC from the nirB promoter (pTETnir15) elicited
very high anti-tetanus antibody responses in mice. The
article by Chatfield et al was published after the priority
date of this application. However, we have also found that when it was attempted
to express the P28 antigen
