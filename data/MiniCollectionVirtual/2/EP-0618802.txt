<ABSTRACT>
Compositions of the invention include composites comprising a biomaterial carrying compounds with enhanced cell binding with respect to collagen. These composites are useful for soft and hard tissue repair or reconstruction. Suitable compounds with enhanced cell binding include synthetic peptides that mimic the conformation necessary for recognition and docketing of collagen binding species (such as cell surface receptors for collagen and fibronectin). Hydrogel matrices as the biomaterial promote cell attachment to the matrix and cell migration into the matrix.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention generally relates to
compounds that mimic a small biologically active segment
of collagen, and more particularly relates to compounds
such as synthetic peptides that have enhanced cell
binding with respect to collagen and that are usefully
combined with matrices to form composites for growing
vertebrate cells.Collagen is the most abundant protein found in
vertebrates. Approximately 25 percent of all animal
protein is collagen. Collagen is unusual among proteins
in that the amino acid glycine constitutes one-third of
the total amino acid content and occurs at nearly every
third amino acid residue. Also, many proline amino
acids are found in collagen. Collagen contains two
amino acids present in very few other proteins, i.e.,
hydroxyproline and hydroxylysine. The sequence glycine-proline-hydroxyproline
recurs frequently.Because glycine is a very small amino acid,
chains of collagen can wind tightly around one another
to form a triple helix. The side chains of proline form
cross-links that lock the three strands together.
Additionally, mature collagen frequently contains
carbohydrate units covalently attached to its
hydroxylysine residues. A disaccharide of glucose and
galactose is commonly found attached to strands of
collagen. Still other forms of collagen can form planar
sheets, which are rich in carbohydrates. Collagen functions as a structural protein of
tissues. It is the major fibrous element in skin,
cartilage, bone, tendon, teeth, and blood vessels.
Collagen is present to some extent in nearly all organs
and serves to hold cells together in discrete units. It
forms insoluble fibers that have a high tensile
strength. Furthermore, the basic structure of collagen
is modified to meet the specialized needs of particular
tissues, and these are reflected in the various types of
collagen that have been identified.The several types of collagen are a family of
genetically related proteins that exhibit fundamentally
similar secondary and tertiary protein structures. As
used herein unless otherwise specified, "collagen"
refers to any of the known types of collagens.Type I collagen, the most prevalent type and
the species found in skin, tendon, bone, and cornea, is
comprised of two chains of one kind, termed α1(I), and
one of another, termed α2(I). Other types of collagen
have three identical chains. Each of the three strands
consists of about 1,000 amino acid residues, and each
has a helical conformation. The three strands wind
around each other to form a superhelical cable and are
hydrog
