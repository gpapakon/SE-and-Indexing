<ABSTRACT>
Tissue sheets (23), useful for facial or bath tissue, 
can be embossed with a fine scale embossing pattern to 

increase bulk with a minimal loss in strength. The fine 
scale embossing pattern contains at least about 15 discrete 

intermeshing embossing elements (24,25) per square 
centimeter (100 per square inch) and can enable the tissue 

manufacturer to produce premium quality tissues having 
adequate softness, Bulk and Strength from conventional 

tissue basesheets without layering or throughdrying 
equipment. Depending on the starting basesheet material, 

tissues having a unique balance of properties can be 
produced, especially for conventional wet-pressed 

basesheets.

<DESCRIPTION>
In the manufacture of soft tissue products such as
facial, bath and towel tissue, an aqueous suspension of
papermaking fibers is deposited onto a forming fabric from
a headbox. The newly-formed web is thereafter dewatered,
dried and creped to form a soft tissue sheet. The trend in
premium tissue manufacture has been to provide softer,
bulkier, less stiff sheets by layering, throughdrying and
basis weight reductions. Layering, which requires a headbox
equipped with headbox dividers, enables the tissue
manufacturer to engineer the tissue by placing softer
feeling fibers in the outer layers while placing the
stronger fibers, which generally do not feel as soft, in
the middle of the tissue sheet. Throughdrying enables the
manufacturer to produce a bulky sheet by drying the sheet
with air in a noncompressive state. Reducing the basis
weight of the sheet reduces its stiffness and, when used in
conjunction with throughdrying, a single-ply tissue sheet
of adequate caliper and performance for a premium product
can be attained.However, producing a premium tissue product of
adequate softness, bulk and strength on conventional (wet-pressed)
tissue machines is not easily accomplished. For
example, layering requires the purchase of a layered
headbox, which is expensive. Higher bulk can be achieved by
embossing, but embossing normally requires a relatively
stiff sheet in order for the sheet to retain the embossing
pattern. Increasing sheet stiffness negatively impacts
softness. Conventional embossing, such as that carried out
in WO 85/03029, also substantially reduces the strength of
the sheet and may lower the strength below acceptable
levels in an effort to attain suitable bulk. US-A-4 339 088
is directed to another method of embossing, in which
products in convolutely wound rolls are embossed with co-mating
rolls. Reducing the basis weight of the sheet will
decrease its stiffness, but may require that two or more of
such low basis weight sheets be plied together to retain
the desired 
caliper and performance. In terms of manufacturing economy,
multiple-ply products are more expensive to produce than
single-ply products, but single-ply products generally lack
sufficient softness and bulk, especially when manufactured
on conventional machines.Accordingly there is a need for a simple means of
enabling conventional tissue machines to produce premium
quality tissue sheets having adequate softness, bulk and
strength without the expense of purchasing a layered
headbox or a throughdryer, or manufacturing multiple plies.As

<CLAIMS>
A method of making a soft tissue sheet comprising
passing a tissue sheet (23) through a nip formed between

male (22) and female (21) embossing rolls having about 15
or more discrete, intermeshing, unmatched, embossing

elements (24,25) per square centimeter of surface which
deflect the sheet (23) perpendicular to its plane, wherein

the embossing elements cause, when they are engaged,
shearing of the tissue to create a permanent deformation

without perforation of said tissue, so that the percent
Bulk increase divided by the percent Strength decrease is

about 1 or greater.
The method of Claim 1 wherein the number of
discr
ete intermeshing elements (24,25) is from about 30 to
about 95 per square centimeter.
The method of Claim 2 wherein the number of
discrete intermeshing elements (24,25) is from about 45 to

about 75 per square centimeter.
The method of any of Claims 1 to 3 wherein the
percent Bulk increase divided by the percent Strength

decrease is from about 1 to about 4.
The method of Claim 4 wherein the percent Bulk
increase divided by the percent Strength decrease is from

about 2 to about 3.
The method of any of Claims 2 to 5 wherein said
intermeshing embossing elements (24,25) are engaged at an

embossing level (26) of from about 0.1 to about 1
millimeter.
The method of Claim 6 wherein the intermeshing
embossing elements (24,25) are engaged at an embossing

level of from about 0.25 to about 0.5 millimeter. 
The method of any of the preceding claims wherein
the embossing elements have a degree of accommodation of

from about 0.075 to about 1.25 millimeter.
The method of Claim 8 wherein the embossing
elements have a degree of accommodation of from about 0.25

to about 0.75 millimeter.

wherein the unmatched elements have substantially equal

sidewall angles.
The method of Claim 10 wherein the sidewall
angles are from about 15° to about 25°.
The method of Claim 11 wherein the top of the
male element is larger than the bottom of the female

element.
The method of any of Claims 2 to 12 wherein the
embossing pattern further satisfies the formula:


B ≥ (2A + C),

wherein

"A" is the accommodation,
"B" is the element width, and
"C" is the female roll land distance between female
voids

direction.
