<ABSTRACT>
A system for measuring and/or controlling the temperature of a component. 
The component is electrically conductive with a positive or negative 

temperature coefficient. The component could be a capillary tubing of 
said conductive material, or coated with such a material, for chromatographic 

usages. The component is interconnected in a first branche of a 
resistance measuring bridge circuit. The system is provided with means 

for detecting the imbalance of the bridge circuit and for direct 
measuring and/or controlling the temperature, with means for balancing 

the bridge circuit.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates generally to a system for measuring and/or 
controlling the temperature of a component and in particular to improvements 
in design and operation of gas-chromatography instrumentation. This invention provides improvements in the system and method for 
heating, cooling and temperature control in general utilizing resistance 
heating and resistance measuring techniques. More specifically, the system permits direct temperature control of 
a capillary of electrical conductive material, or a capillary coated with 
such material, for chromatographic usages. A temperature control system comprising, in part, of a capillary 
tube of conductive material having a positive or negative temperature 
coefficient. The resistance of such a tube at any moment is, given a known base 
resistance and the temperature coefficient, a direct indication for the 
average temperature of the tube. Also, the same resistance can be used for heating purposes. When 
putting a current through the tube, it will heat-up due to the resistance 
heating until a equilibrium is reached with heat-losses to the environment. Because the driver voltage for the bridge excitation and for the 
heating process is the same, the signal levels in both actions are the 
same and thus the dimensioning of the electronics is easy. But, of course, the sensing current will also heat the tube and 
therefore the conversion period is made very short, to minimize self-heating. 
As explained later, the heating and sensing current can be of 
any kind: DC, rectified AC, or even pure AC as long as the electronics 
stay within their operating zones and data processing accounts for it. As known, the resistance (of the tube) can be calculated when both 
the voltage across and the current flowing through that resistor are 
known. Here, the tube-resistance is used in a kind of Bridge Circuit, for 
example a Bridge of Wheatstone provided with means for detecting the  
 
imbalance and/or balancing the bridge circuit. One branch of that bridge 
is formed by the tube (-resistance) and a second resistor, with the 
second "resistor" preferably formed by a current sensing FET, through 
which the current can be sensed as well as controlled (switched on/off). The other branch of the bridge is formed by a series connection of 
two resistors, preferably by a multiplying DAC. By using the summed equivalent 
voltages of the power-branch with the tube as reference voltage 
for the MDAC, in a preferred embodiment of this invention the equilibrium 
of the bridge can
