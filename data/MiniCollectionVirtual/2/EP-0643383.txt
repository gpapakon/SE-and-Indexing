<ABSTRACT>
An apparatus for positioning a magnetic tape head (3) 
transversely relative to a 

length of magnetic tape in a magnetic tape recorder 
along a shaft. The shaft (6) 

vertical axis may be slightly tilted to compensate 
for manufacturing tolerances and 

achieve the necessary alignment of the magnetic 
tape head to the magnetic tape (3) 

path. To accomplish this, one end of the shaft (6) is 
supported in a washer bracket (12) 

for connecting that end of the shaft to the tape 
drive frame (1). The washer bracket (12) 

is pre-loaded axially of the shaft (6), such that a 
directing force applied to that end of 

the shaft permits the washer bracket to slide in a 
direction transverse to the axial 

direction of the shaft on the frame. Otherwise, 
the washer bracket (12) frictionally 

abuts the frame (1) and holds that end of the shaft (6) 
in fixed position on the frame (1).

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates generally to magnetic tape recorders, and, in particular,
to a mechanism for supporting and adjusting the azimuth angle of a magnetic tape
head relative to the direction of travel of the magnetic tape.Magnetic tape recorders are used, for example, as memory back-up devices
for computer systems. In connection with such devices, means are provided for
positioning a magnetic read/write head to tracks of a magnetic tape, the tracks
extending parallel and longitudinal on the length of the magnetic tape in the
direction of travel of the tape across the magnetic head. At the end of a track, the
magnetic head must be moved transversely across the tape to access an adjacent
parallel track before the tape direction is reversed and the adjacent track is
accessed.The magnetic head must be capable of moving transversely across the tape
in increments at least as small as the width of a track, and be accurately
maintained at each position. It is known to position a magnetic head to various
tracks of a magnetic tape in a magnetic tape recorder as described in U.S. Patent
4,609,959 according to which claims 1 and 5 have been cast in the two-part form. The magnetic head is mounted at one end of a head carriage while
the other end of the carriage is disposed for axial movement along the length of a
vertically extending shaft. The other end of the carriage is displaced along the
shaft via a worm wheel. The worm wheel is internally threaded for interaction
with exterior threads on the shaft, and is rotated by a motor-driven worm gear.It is also known in connection with devices for positioning a magnetic head
to various tracks of a magnetic tape to enable the shaft to be slightly tilted along 
its azimuth and zenith axes to compensate for manufacturing tolerances.
Typically, this compensation is performed once in the factory to achieve the
necessary alignment of the magnetic head to the magnetic tape travel path. For
example, the need for such adjustment of the shaft vertical axis is described in
U.S. Patent 5,105,322. An object of the present invention is to provide a simple
and reliable method and apparatus for factory adjustment of the magnetic head
along its azimuth and zenith axes.Such adjusting of azimuth and zenith directions of the
magnetic head can for example be performed in the device as
disclosed in U.S. patent 4 609 959. A bearing plate of a shaft
that carries the magnetic head via a magnetic head support has
to be dismounted, then adjusting has to be performed, and
afterwards the bearing
