<ABSTRACT>
An operator/facsimile interface enables entry of alpha-numeric 
data from a telephone-style keyboard. Alteration 

of displayed alpha-numeric characters may be accomplished 
by actuation of arrow keys, or sequential key presses of an 

alpha-numeric key. A displayed alpha-numeric character may 
be entered by actuation of an arrow key, an Enter key or a 

different alpha-numeric key. Completion of an alpha-numeric 
entry may be signaled by actuation of a Start key 

or Enter key. An offer of help message is automatically 
displayed for the operator if a preset time expires between 

sequential key presses or if the average time over a 
plurality of sequential key presses exceeds a predetermined 

average.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a facsimile unit, for example to
an operator interface for a facsimile that provides
multiple, alternative, input paths to accomplish procedures
employed by the facsimile.Other aspects of the subject matter of this application are
covered in our copending European patent applications no.
EP-A-0653875 and EP-A-0649239, filed the same day as this
application.Once a facsimile machine has been properly set up by the
operator, it operates in a substantially automatic mode to
accomplish its connection, transmission and sign-off
functions. If the facsimile includes a "one-touch" feature
wherein actuations of each of a plurality of single buttons
accesses prestored telephone numbers, the transmitting fax
machine, upon actuation of one such button, automatically
dials the remote telephone number and transmits a standard
recognition signal which the receiving facsimile
acknowledges. Then, the transmitting and receiving
facsimiles send short messages back and forth to select the
highest speed possible before sending the documents. No
action is required of an operator during this action, at 
either the sending or the receiving end. When a transmission
is completed, the facsimile units automatically
disconnect and the receiving facsimile provides hard copy
for the operator.While transmission and reception operations of a facsimile
are highly automated and require little or no operator
input, such "user-friendliness" is often not manifest when
an operator wishes to input instructions or data into the
facsimile via a control panel. Facsimile/operator interfaces
typically recognize only a single sequence of
operations to accomplish a given input task. To determine
the correct procedure sequence, the operator must refer to
an instruction manual and follow its instructions slavishly
to assure proper accomplishment of a desired task. Any
deviation from the required sequence of operations will
prevent the accomplishment of the desired task.Facsimile operator panels employ multiple keys that enable
multiple functions to be accomplished - assuming the
operator is aware of the proper sequence of key
activations. Because of both cost and size restraints,
little directory information is contained on the face of
the operator panel other than short key names. Certain key
names are ambiguous and lead to user confusion as to the
exact function to be performed by the key.WO-A-92/19067 discloses a facsimile machine which, when
powered up after a predetermined period, provides the
operator with instructions

<CLAIMS>
A facsimile unit including an operator panel (50) with a keyboard (52) and
a display panel (54), a subset of keys (58) in said keyboard having a plurality of

assigned alphabetic characters in addition to numeric character assignments and
a key designated UNDO, said facsimile unit comprising:


means (70,76,78) for initiating a data entry mode in said facsimile unit;
timer means (10) responsive to actuation of a key in said keyboard (52)
during said data entry mode to commence a timing action; and
processor means (10) responsive to an output from said timer means (10)
indicating that at least a predetermined timed interval has elapsed since

actuation of said key, without a subsequent actuation of a key, to display
a help message on said display panel (54), said processor means being

operative to recognize key actuations of at least first and second keys of
said keyboard that have no alphabetic assignments as yes and no responses

respectively, and being responsive to actuation of said second key or an
actuation of said UNDO key as a refusal of said help message.
A facsimile unit as recited in claim 1, wherein said processor means (10)
is responsive to an operator's refusal of help, to reset said timer means (10) and,

upon expiry of a further predetermined time interval without a subsequent
actuation of a key, to again display on said 
display panel (54) a help message,
and upon an operator's further refusal of help, to inhibit further display of help

messages on said display panel (54).
A facsimile unit as recited in claim 1 or 2, wherein said processor means
(10) is operative to monitor a rate of key actuations by an operator, and if said

rate of key actuations does not reach a predetermined threshold to display a help
message on said display panel (54). 
A facsimile unit as recited in claim 3, wherein said timer means (10) is
responsive to a first actuation of an alpha-numeric key (58) to provide a measure

of total elapsed time from said first actuation, and said processor means (10) is
operative to determine a time sum that is equal to a sum of (i) an elapsed time

from said first actuation to a key actuation and (ii) a number of key actuations
multiplied by a predetermined key-actuation interval, said processor means (10)

being operative to display said help message when said measure of total elapsed
time exceeds said time sum.
A facsimile unit as recited in claim 4, wherein said processor means (10)
is responsive to a user's refusal of a help message to cause said timer means (10)

to reduce said measure of total elapsed time by a determined amount, but to
continue measuring said elapsed time and if said measure of total elapsed time

again exceeds said time sum to display said help message.
A facsimile unit as recited in claim 5, wherein said processor means (10)
is operative to inhibit said display of said help message upon an operator's

second refusal of said help message.
A method of operating a facsimile unit that includes an operator panel (50)
with a keyboard (52) and a display panel (54), a subset of keys (58) in said

keyboard (52) having a plurality of assigned alphabetic characters in addition to
numeric character assignments and a key (62) designated UNDO, and a

processor (10) able to recognise key actuations of at least first and second keys
of said keyboard that have no alphabetic assignments as yes and no responses

respectively; said method comprising the steps of:

initiating a data entry mode in said facsimile unit;
commencing a timing action in response to actuation of a key in said
keyboard during said data entry mode; 
responding to an output from said timing action indicating that at least a
predetermined timed interval has elapsed since actuation of said key,

without a subsequent actuation of a key, to display a help message on said
display panel (54); and
responding to actuation of said second key or an actuation of said UNDO
key as a refusal of said help message.
A method as recited in claim 7, comprising the steps of:

responding to an operator's refusal of help, to reset said timing action
and, upon expiry of a further predetermined time interval without a

subsequent actuation of a key, to again display on said display panel (54)
a help message; and
responding to an operator's further refusal of help, to inhibit further
display of help messages on said display panel (54).
A method as recited in claim 7 or 8, comprising the steps of:

monitoring a rate of key actuations by an operator; and
displaying a help message on said display panel (54) if said rate of key
actuation does not reach a predetermined threshold.
A method as recited in claim 9, comprising the steps of:

responding to a first actuation of an alpha-numeric key by providing a
measure of total elapsed time from said first actuation;
determining a time sum that is equal to a sum of (i) an elapsed time from
said first actuation to a key actuation and (ii) a number of key actuations

multiplied by a predetermined key-actuation interval constant; and
displaying said help message when said measure of total elapsed time
exceeds said time sum.
A method as recited in claim 10, comprising the steps of:

responding to a user's refusal of a help message to cause said timing
action to reduce said measure of total elapsed time by a determined amount, but

to continue measuring said elapsed time; and
displaying said help message if said measure of total elapsed time again
exceeds said time sum.
A method as recited in claim 11, comprising the step of:

   inhibiting said display of said help message upon an operator's second
refusal of said help message.
