<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an improved safety system, 
with a thermostat with an immersion rod sensor. More particularly, the invention concerns a safety system 
realized in such a way to be more sensible with respect to the solutions 
presently available on the market. As it is well known, the thermostats with immersion rod sensor 
for water heaters and like provide a brass rod placed within a sheath that 
is immersed within the liquid. Within the brass rod a low thermal dilatation rod is provided. When the liquid has reached the preestablished temperature, 
the brass rod expands, dragging during its dilatation also the inner rod, 
and acts then on a mechanical circuit that interrupts a phase of the 
electric circuit, thus excluding the resistance. This kind of thermostats is also provided with a further safety 
device, that intervenes in case of failure of the above mentioned device, 
so that in case still higher temperatures are reached, it provides to 
interrupt both the phases of the electric circuit. At present, this safety system is realized by a bimetallic disk 
that, in case the temperature increases up to reach a preestablished 
temperature, gets deformed. Said bimetallic disk is very thin and is 
shaped in such a way to get deformed, when the transition temperature is 
reached, tripping from a concave position to a convex position or vice 
versa. The bimetallic disk is now placed within a cavity of the 
thermostat, realized with conductive material, that contacts the liquid, 
therefore the warping effect is obtained on the basis of a heat 
transmission between said cavity, heated by the liquid, and the bimetallic 
disk. This means that the sensitivity of the safety system is entrusted 
to said heat transmission, and further to the reading of the temperature in 
correspondence of the cavity. Furthermore, and this feature is not admitted by the safety rules 
of some countries, the bimetallic disk with the decreasing of the 
temperature, rearms, by the reversed process that brought it to trip 
following an increasing of the temperature. Such an apparatus is known for example from FR-A-2149242, forming the base of the preamble of claim 1.  
 In view of all the above considerations, the Applicant has 
studied a solution concerning the safety system that allows to have 
greatly improved sensitibility features while sensing the temperature with 
respect to the prior art solutions. Further, the solution according to the present invention does 
not allow that the safety system automatically
