<ABSTRACT>
A heald retention mechanism for a weaving loom comprises 
a heald member (11) mounted for reciprocatory movement, a 

retaining member (18) for engagement with the heald 
member (11) at a predetermined point in its reciprocatory 

stroke, and electro-active means (21) the change in shape 
of which occurring as a result of a change in the 

electrically energised state thereof generates relative 
movement between the heald member (11) and the retaining 

member (18) to effect engagement or disengagement of the 
heald member (11) and the retaining member (18).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a heald member retention 
mechanism for a weaving loom. Conventionally in a weaving loom heald members are 
arranged in pairs each pair controlling the shed position 
of an associated heald eye, each heald eye being 
associated in use with a respective warp thread. During 
weaving the heald members of each pair are raised and 
lowered sequentially and when both heald members are 
retained in a raised position the associated heald eye 
and the associated warp thread is held in a first shed 
position, but when either of the heald members of the 
associated pair is not retained in its raised position 
then the heald eye will reside in its other shed 
position. It is known to control retention of the heald 
members in their raised position electronically, and thus 
to effect electronic control over the woven pattern 
produced by the weaving loom. British Patent 2047755 and European Patents 119787 and 
188074 all illustrate electromagnetic arrangements for 
retaining heald members in a raised position. In each 
case a solenoid is used to produce a magnetic field, and 
the electromagnetic effect either causes operation of a 
latching mechanism which cooperates with the heald 
member, or, where the heald member is ferromagnetic and 
flexible, the electromagnetic effect deflects the heald 
member to coact with a stationary latching component. 
Weaving looms may incorporate very large numbers of sets 
of heald members and their associated solenoids and there 
are a number of disadvantages which the present invention 
seeks to overcome. For example, the power consumption of 
each solenoid can be in the region of two to three watts 
and overall therefore the power consumption of a large 
number of solenoids in a large loom can prove problematic  
 
both in providing the necessary power supplies, and in 
the heat generated by the solenoids. Moreover, each pair 
of heald members and its associated solenoid arrangement 
is relatively bulky and thus in a large loom the large 
number of heald members and their associated solenoids 
occupy a considerable amount of space. If heald members 
and their associated solenoids are packed very closely 
together then heald members may unintentionally be 
retained in their raised position by stray magnetic 
fields from adjacent solenoids. GB 1399615 discloses a number of embodiments in which 
heald members are raised and lowered by a plurality of 
draw knives, each draw knife including a hook arranged to 
slide between a position in which it

A heald retention mechanism for a weaving loom 
comprising a heald member (11) mounted for reciprocatory 

movement, a retaining member (18) for engagement with the 
heald member (11) at a predetermined point in its 

reciprocatory stroke, and electro-active means (21) and 
characterized in that the change in shape of the electro-active 

means (21) occurring as a result of a change in 
the electrically energised state thereof generates 

relative movement between the heald member (11) and the 
retaining member (18) to effect engagement or 

disengagement of the heald member (11) and the retaining 
member (18). 
A heald retention mechanism as claimed in Claim 1, 
characterized in that said electro-active means (21) 

includes an elongate element which flexes along its 
length as a result of a change in its electrically 

energised state. 
A heald retention mechanism as claimed in Claim 1 
or Claim 2, characterized in that the heald member (11) 

is mounted for sliding movement in a channel (14) between 
two guide members (15, 16). 
A heald retention mechanism as claimed in Claim 3, 
characterized in that an end region (17) of the channel 

(14) is of wedge shaped cross-section. 
A heald retention mechanism as claimed in Claim 4, 
characterized in that the retaining member (18) comprises 

a hook provided at the end region (17) of the channel 
(14), the hook being arranged to engage in an aperture 

(13) provided in the heald member (11). 
A heald retention mechanism as claimed in any one 
 

of the preceding claims, characterized in that the change 
in shape of the electro-active means (21) causes flexure 

of the heald member (11) to cooperate with the retaining 

member (18). 
A heald retention mechanism as claimed in Claim 6, 
characterized in that the electro-active means (21) is 

connected to the heald member (11). 
A heald retention mechanism as claimed in Claim 6, 
characterized in that the electro-active means (21) 

slidably engages the heald member (11). 
A heald retention mechanism as claimed in any one 
of claims 1 to 5, characterized in that the change in 

shape of the electro-active means (21) generates movement 
of the retaining member (18) to engage the heald member 

(11). 
A heald retention mechanism as claimed in any one 
of Claims 1 to 9, characterized in that the electro-active 

means (21) comprises an electro-strictive, piezo-ceramic 
or piezo-polymer material.
