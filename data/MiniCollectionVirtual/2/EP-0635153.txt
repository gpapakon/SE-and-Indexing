<ABSTRACT>
In order to record accidents caused to parked vehicles, for example by other cars, the invention provides that an accident data memory installed in the parked vehicle is extended by means which, preferably after a certain time-lag after switching off the engine, maintain the accident data memory of the vehicle operative for a limited time with a sensitivity which is greater than that prevailing when the vehicle engine is switched on, in constant readiness for the detection and recording of an accident situation.

<CLAIMS>
Accident data recorder 

a) having means for the acquisition of acceleration 
signals, 
b) having means for the analysis of the acquired 
acceleration signals with regard to their amplitude 

and their duration of action for the detection of an 
accident situation, 
c) having means for the interrogation of the operating 
state of the drive assembly of the vehicle in which 

the accident data recorder is installed, and 
d) having means for the storage of the acquired signals 
and/or of the data determined therefrom, 
 
characterized by means which, after the vehicle's drive 

assembly has been switched off, maintain the accident data 
recorder active in a continuing state of readiness for the 

detection and recording of an accident situation for a 
limited time at a sensitivity which is increased in 

comparison with the state of the switched-on drive 
assembly. 
Accident data recorder according to Claim 1, 
characterized in that the detection of the operating state 

of the vehicle's drive assembly is effected by an 
interrogation of the position of the ignition starter 

switch. 
Accident data recorder according to Claim 1 or 2, 
characterized in that the switching-over to the increased 

sensitivity to the detection and recording of an accident 
situation is effected in a time-delayed manner after the 

vehicle's drive assembly has been switched off. 
Accident data recorder according to Claim 1, 2 or 3, 
characterized in that the means for the detection and 

recording of an accident situation which are in a  
 

continuing state of readiness after the vehicle's drive 
assembly has been switched off are equipped with time-counting 

means for recording the time of the accident 
occurrence.
