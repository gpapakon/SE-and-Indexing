<ABSTRACT>
Multipoint electronic fuel injection system with overlap足
ping sequential injector actuation having a plurality of dual 

injector driver circuits (22-28) corresponding to an equivalent 

number of solenoid fuel injector pairs (L1, L5; ...; L4, L8) 
supplying fuel to an internal combustion engine, the injectors 

(L1-L8) being partitioned into two groups (L1-L4, L5-L8) with 
each pair having one injector from each group and by sequen足

tially actuating the members of one group (L1-L4,) and then 
the members of the other (L5-L8), every injector (L1; ...; L8) 

being capable to be actuated for an extended portion of an 
injection cycle up to one full engine revolution; a bilevel select 

signal (SEL1; ...;SEL4) initiated with the actuation signal 
(EPP) is gated to each driver circuit (22; ...;28) to enable each 

injector of a pair for one half of the sequencing period; associ足
ated with each driver circuit (22; ...;28) is an independent 

pulse generator (14; ...;20) which is additionally triggered in 
the sequence, the duration of the pulse width signals (PW1-足

PW4) from the pulse generators (14-20) being dependent on 
instantaneous engine operating parameters at the time of 

actuation; an inhibit feature for each pulse generator 
(14; ...;20) is provided during desired acceleration or starting 

condition to extend the pulse width signal (PW1;....;PW4) for 
the duration of time between two actuations; and provision is 

also made for banking the pulse width signals (PW1-PW4) to 
the driver circuits (22-28) during conditions when the engine 

may flood.
