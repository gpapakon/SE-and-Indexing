<ABSTRACT>
The present invention provides a method for making an offset 
printing plate according to the silver salt diffusion transfer 

process using rinsing water,
 

characterized in that alkali is added to said rinsing water before 
washing at most 20 m² of said exposed and developed imaging element 

and/or before being in use for more than 24 hours in such an amount 
that a pH in said washing water between 10.5 and 13 is obtained.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method for making
lithographic printing plates according to the silver salt diffusion
transfer process in a more ecological and economical way.The principles of the silver complex diffusion transfer reversal
process, hereinafter called DTR-process, have been described e.g. in
US-P-2,352,014 and in the book "Photographic Silver Halide Diffusion
Processes" by André Rott and Edith Weyde - The Focal Press - London
and New York, (1972).In the DTR-process non-developed silver halide of an
information-wise exposed photographic silver halide emulsion layer
material is transformed with a so-called silver halide solvent into
soluble silver complex compounds which are allowed to diffuse into
an image receiving element and are reduced therein with a developing
agent, generally in the presence of physical development nuclei, to
form a silver image having reversed image density values
("DTR-image") with respect to the black silver image obtained in the
exposed areas of the photographic material.A DTR-image bearing material can be used as a planographic
printing plate wherein the DTR-silver image areas form the
water-repellant ink-receptive areas on a water-receptive
ink-repellant background.The DTR-image can be formed in the image receiving layer of a
sheet or web material which is a separate element with respect to
the photographic silver halide emulsion material (a so-called
two-sheet DTR element) or in the image receiving layer of a
so-called single-support-element, also called mono-sheet element,
which contains at least one photographic silver halide emulsion
layer integral with an image receiving layer in waterpermeable
relationship therewith. It is the latter mono-sheet version which
is preferred for the preparation of offset printing plates by the
DTR method.Two types of the mono-sheet DTR offset printing plate exist.
According to a first type disclosed in e.g. US-P-4,722,535 and GB-1,241,661 
a support is provided in the order given with a silver
halide emulsion layer and a layer containing physical development
nuclei serving as the image-receiving layer. After information-wise
exposure and development the imaged element is used as a printing
plate without the removal of the emulsion layer.According to a second type of mono-sheet DTR offset printing
plate a hydrophilic support, mostly anodized aluminium, is provided
in the order given with a layer of physical development nuclei and a
silver halide emulsion layer. After information-wise exposure and
development the imaged

A method for making an offset printing plate according to the
silver salt diffusion transfer process comprising the steps of:


information-wise exposing an imaging element comprising in the
order given (i) a hydrophilic base, (ii) an image receiving layer
