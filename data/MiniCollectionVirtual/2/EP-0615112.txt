<ABSTRACT>
In a method for the determination of the yield of oil wells producing water/oil emulsions, the water/oil emulsion to be analysed is degassed and introduced into the first of three chambers, of which the first overflows into the second and the second overflows into the third, in such an amount that the third chamber too is at least partially filled, the contents of the third chamber are taken out and with heating and/or addition of deemulsifiers (emulsion separators) is recirculated into the first chamber, until a separation of the entire emulsion into an aqueous phase and an oil phase has taken place in the chambers, and after the separation of the emulsion the proportions of the aqueous phase and the oil phase are determined. The invention further relates to a test separator to carry out this method.
