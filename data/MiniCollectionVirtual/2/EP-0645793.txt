<ABSTRACT>
An electron device of the present invention 
comprises an i-type diamond layer formed on a substrate, 

and an n-type diamond layer formed on the i-type diamond 
layer and having a first surface region formed flatly and 

a second surface region containing an emitter portion, 
which are set in a vacuum container, in which the emitter 

portion formed of the n-type diamond has a bottom area 10 
or less µm square and projects relative to the first 

surface region. In the n-type diamond layer, a 
difference is fine between the conduction band and the 

vacuum level. Also, since the n-type diamond layer is 
doped with an n-type dopant in a high concentration, 

metal conduction is dominant as conduction of electrons. 
Therefore, setting the temperature of the substrate at a 

predetermined temperature and generating an electric 
field near the surface of the emitter portion, electrons 

are emitted with a high efficiency from the tip portion of 
the emitter portion into the vacuum. Even though the 

emitter portion does not have a tip portion formed in a 
very fine shape, electrons can readily be taken out into 

the vacuum by the field emission with relatively small 
field strength. Consequently, the emission current and 

the current gain increase and the current density in the 
emitter portion decreases, thus increasing the withstand 

current or withstand voltage.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an electron emitting device 
utilized in a cold-cathode device functioning as an 
emitter of an electron beam in a micro vacuum tube, a light-emitting 
device array, etc. Conventional semiconductor devices had such 
drawbacks that electron mobility is as low as 1/1000 
times that in vacuum and that reliability is low against 
radiation. On the other hand, conventional vacuum tubes 
had no such drawbacks. It has thus been being considered 
that ICs having the performance of the conventional 
vacuum tubes could be produced by fabricating the micro 
vacuum tube using the micromachining techniques fostered 
in the field of Si semiconductor devices. Accordingly, 
the micro vacuum tube overcoming the drawbacks of the 
conventional semiconductor devices has been vigorously 
studied and developed effectively using the fabrication 
technology of Si semiconductor devices. Studied in connection with such a trend is an 
emitter of electron beam used in the micro vacuum tube, 
the light-emitting device array, etc. The conventional 
vacuum tubes, however, had a drawback of needing a long  
 
standby time of several minutes between start of 
operation and a state of being ready for use. Overcoming 
it, electron emitting devices such as the micro vacuum tube 
considerably shortened the standby time by such an 
arrangement that the tip of an emitter portion is 
micromachined like a very acute needle by the fabrication 
technology of Si semiconductor devices so that electrons 
can be emitted by the field emission. Also, it comes to recent attention that diamond is 
used as a material for the electron emitting devices. Diamond has 
the thermal conductivity of 20 W/cm·K, which is maximum 
among other materials for the electron emitting devices and which 
is 10 or more times larger than that of Si. Since diamond 
is thus excellent in heat radiation for a large current 
density, electron emitting devices operable at high temperatures 
can be produced using diamond as a constituent material. Further, diamond is an insulator in an undoped 
state, which has a high dielectric strength, a small 
dielectric constant of 5.5, and a high breakdown voltage 
of 5 × 106 V/cm. Thus, diamond is a potential material for 
electron emitting devices for high power used in the high-frequency 
region. To produce low-resistance diamond, Geis et al. at 
MIT formed an n-type diamond semiconductor by 
implantation of carbon, as described in the document "IEEE Electron Device Letters", 12 (1991), 456. This prior art
