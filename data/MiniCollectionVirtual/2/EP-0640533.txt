<ABSTRACT>
An improvement in a bin-type, bulk fluid 
container. The container comprises a rigid carton (12) 

containing a plastic bag (20). The bag has an evacuation 
element (21) on its side adjacent its bottom. The bag rests 

on a wedge shaped insert (30) in the carton. The insert 
comprises a body molded in one piece from relatively 

dense, expanded plastic. The insert includes an upper 
panel supported by walls and partitions between the 

walls.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to bin-type, bulk fluid 
containers. It relates particularly to a bin-type bulk 
fluid container with an evacuation orifice at the bottom 
of the bin. Bin-Type bulk liquid containers are generally 
used for the storage and transportation of large 
quantities of liquids. The containers comprise a rigid 
carton, usually constructed of corrugated cardboard or 
other lightweight fiber or paper materials, and are 
manufactured in standard sizes: 55 gallon, 110 gallon, 
220 gallon, 275 gallon, 300 gallon, and 330 gallon 
capacities. The dimensions of the containers allow for 
mounting on standard-sized, rectangular loading pallets. 
These bulk containers offer substantial economic 
advantages over traditional metal drums or barrels 
because the bulk containers weigh less and are made from 
recyclable materials. Furthermore, the containers are 
manufactured in interlocking geometric sizes and shapes 
which simplify storage and minimize wasted storage space. 
For instance, intermediate size bulk containers may be 
stacked several units high. These advantages lead to 
lower freight rates, manufacturing ease, ease of  
 
operation, lower overall costs, and substantial space 
savings. A bulk container for storing or transporting 
liquids also conventionally comprises a polyethylene bag 
placed within the rigid carton to hold the liquid 
product. The bag normally has a spigot, valve, or sealed 
tube molded into its side to permit evacuation of the 
liquid from the filled bag. When the bag is positioned 
inside the carton, this evacuation element projects 
through a small opening or orifice in the side of the 
carton, near the bottom. The carton effectively causes the liquid-filled 
polyethylene bag to conform to the shape of the carton. 
The bag is susceptible to rupture during transport, 
however, due to inertial movement or "splashing" of the 
liquid within the bag. The hydraulic energy of the 
liquid during movement sometimes causes the bag to 
stretch and crack. This problem is more significant when 
the bag is filled with liquids that are not too viscous. The polyethylene bag is subject to increased 
stretching and an increased possibility of rupture if an 
air space is left between the filled bag and the top of 
the carton. The fluid transport and storage industry 
deals with this problem by filling this air space with 
dunnage to absorb some of the hydraulic energy of the 
liquid. The dunnage used is lightweight and 
compressible, and prevents the fluid-filled bag from 
shifting

<CLAIMS>
In a bin-type, bulk fluid container wherein the 
container includes a carton having a bottom wall, and a 

top wall interconnected by side walls, an orifice is 
formed in one of the walls adjacent the bottom of the 

carton and a bag for holding fluid is disposed within 
said carton and has a drainage element in its side 

adapted to fit through the orifice, the improvement 
comprising: 


a) a removable insert mounted in said carton 
underneath said bag; 
b) said insert having a support surface on 
which said bag rests; 
c) said support surface having a shape 
effective to deform said bag so as to 

cause liquid in said bag to flow by 
gravity toward said drainage element.

bulk fluid container including a carton having an 

evacuation orifice on a sidewall, said insert comprising: 

a) a molded plastic foam body adapted to fit 
in the bottom of a carton in a bin-type 

bulk fluid container; 
b) said body including a roof panel having a 
support surface on top of it; 
c) said roof panel being supported by a 
plurality of wall panels. 
The insert of Claim 6 further characterized in 
that: 


a) said body is molded in one piece of a foam 
plastic;

from each of a plurality of said wall 

panels. 
The insert of Claim 7 further characterized in 
that: 


a) said roof panel includes a plurality of 
panel sections; 
b) at least two of said panel sections being 
inclined relative to the horizontal and 

relative to each other. 
The insert of Claim 8 further characterized in 
that: 


a) a cut-out is formed in said roof panel and 
one of said wall panels. 
The insert of Claim 9 further characterized by 
and including: 


a) a support surface on said roof; 
b) said cut-out defining a ledge below said 
support surface. 
The insert of Claim 8 further characterized in 
that: 


a) said support surface is, at its highest 
point, between 125 mm and 175 mm above the 

base of a corresponding wall. 
The insert of Claim 11 further characterized in 
that:
