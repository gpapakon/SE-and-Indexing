<ABSTRACT>
The sealing integrity and/or the proper filling of packages (12) is determined by conveying them continuously along a path (11) and applying loads to them. The loads (24, 26) have package contacting surface portions that travel in the conveying direction, e.g. provided by driven belts (26) or arrays of free-running rollers (46). Preferably each package is subjected to a first load and to a second load greater than the first, and two values related to the effective thickness under the loads are derived and compared by a computer system (36, 38, 40). The difference value is indicative of seal quality.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a package testing 
apparatus and a corresponding method, particularly for food 
stuffs. The testing may be to establish that packages 
are properly sealed and/or that they are properly filled. US-A-4,649,740 discloses 
apparatus in which flexible packages are indexed through 
at least two test stations. At each station, a package 
stops and a load is applied by probe rods. Two 
successive stations apply the same load, and the 
effective thickness of a flexible package is measured in 
each case. The two thickness measurements are compared, 
and a difference is deemed to show a defective package. 
The idea is that a leaky package will be partly deflated 
at the first station, so that the effective thickness 
detected at the second station will be less. But we find 
that this is not reliable. For example, a grossly leaky 
package will be fully deflated at the first station. The 
reading at the second station will therefore be the same 
as at the first, and the package will be accepted as 
correct. Furthermore, the procedure is slow, owing to 
its reliance on static testing. From GB-A-2234076 
the use of conveyors or roller conveyors 
is known.  
 The invention is given with independent claims 1, 6. The effect of a load on a package may be detected by 
assessing the resistance of the package when subjected to 
a load by the load means. This may be done by detecting 
how far the load means can travel under a predetermined 
force and/or by detecting the force required to cause a 
certain amount of travel or a certain degree of 
deformation of the package. Generally detection of the 
travel for a predetermined load is preferred.  
 Preferably the test station has a plurality of load 
means spaced along the path. Preferably a first load 
means for applying a first load is upstream of a second 
load means for applying a second load greater than the 
first load; and there are means for providing outputs 
related to the resistances to said first and second 
loads, comparing said outputs, and deriving thence a 
package quality output. With such an arrangement, a 
grossly leaky package that is fully deflated by the first 
load means will show a different change in resistance 
from a sound package; and a slightly leaky package will 
be different yet again. Thus it is possible to set the 
apparatus to accept packages having not more than a 
predetermined degree of leakiness. The concept of applying a second load that is 
greater than a first load, and gauging the difference in 
response

<CLAIMS>
A package testing apparatus having a test station 
(10) and conveying means (11) for conveying packages (12) 

along a path extending through the test station, the test 
station comprising at least one load means (24,26), means 

(28) for effecting relative reciprocation of the or each 
load means (24,26) towards and away from the path to apply 

a load to a package (12) being conveyed along the path and 
to detect the effect of the load on the package (12); 

wherein the or each load means (24,26) has a package-contacting 
surface portion (46) that is displaceable in the 

conveying direction so that a load can be applied to a 
package (12) while it is being conveyed; characterised in 

that the package-contacting portion (46) is not 
independently driven but is an array of free-running 

rollers (46) adapted to be displaced by contact with 
packages (12) being conveyed along the path. 
Apparatus according to claim 1 wherein the or 
each load means (24,26) is adapted to apply a predetermined 

load, and the effect of the load is measured in terms of 
the displacement of the load means (24,26). 
Apparatus according to claim 1 or 2 wherein the 
test station (10) has a plurality of load means (24,26) 

spaced along the path. 
Apparatus according to claim 3 having a first 
load means (24) for applying a first load upstream of a 

second load means (26) for applying a second load greater 
than the first load; and means (32,36,28,40) for providing  

 
outputs related to the resistances to said first and second 

loads, comparing said outputs, and deriving thence a 
package quality output. 
Apparatus according to claim 4 wherein the means 
(30,32) for assessing resistances to the applied loads 

comprise means for determining the displacements of the 
load means. 
A method of testing packages (12) comprising 
conveying packages (12) along a path and, while they are 

being conveyed, applying a load to a package via an array 
of free-running rollers (46) which are rotated by contact 

with the moving package (12); and detecting the effect of 
the load on the moving package (12).
