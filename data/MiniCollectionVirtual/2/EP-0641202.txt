<DESCRIPTION>
 USE OF INDOLONE DERIVATIVES FOR THE TREATMENT OF MEMORY DISORDERS. SEXUAL DYSFUNCTION AND PARKINSON'S DISEASEThe present invention relates to the use of selective dopamine D3 receptor agonists in therapy, for example in the treatment of memory disorders.Compounds capable of binding selectively to dopamine D3 receptors are known in the art (see, for example, Nature, 1990, 347, 146) . To <iate, however, no specific therapeutic utility has been identified for compounds having such properties.The present invention resides in the identification of such a utility and, in a first aspect, provides selective dopamine D3 receptor agonists for use in therapy.More specifically, the present invention relates to selective dopamine D3 receptor agonists for use in the treatment or prophylaxis of diseases in which agonism of the D3 receptors will prove advantageous, for example, in the treatment of memory disorders, sexual dysfunction and Parkinson's disease.Particular selective dopamine D3 receptor agonists include, for example, compounds of the structure (I) :(I)in which, each group R is the same or different and is hydrogen orC-L_ alkyl; 

R1 and R^ are the same or different and are each hydrogen or Cι_4alkyl; and n is 1 to 3, or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof.Within the scope of the structure (I) and the most preferred selective dopamine D3 receptor agonist of the present invention is the compound 4-(2-di-n-propylaminoethyi)-2- (3H)-indolone hydrochloride having the INN: ropinirole. The compound ropinirole and other compounds of structure (I) are known in the art, for example as having utility in the treatment of Parkinson's disease (EP 0299602-A) .The compounds of structure (I) and, in particular, ropinirole, can be prepared according to the procedures described in EP 113964-B.Selective dopamine D3 receptor agonists are of use in therapy, in particular in the treatment of memory disorders, for example, in the treatment of impaired cerebral functionality, as well as dementia, amnesia and decreased cognitive capacity; in the treatment of sexual dysfunction in both males and females, in particular in the treatment of male and female impotence; and in the treatment of Parkinson's disease.When used in therapy, the compounds of structure (I) , in particular ropinirole, are formulated into a standard pharmaceutical composition, for example as described in EP 113964-B and EP 0299602-A.Preferably the composition is administered in unit dose form. Each dosage unit for oral administration contains preferably from
