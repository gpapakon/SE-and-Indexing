<ABSTRACT>
A preplugged nut (10) is attachable to a vehicle 
panel (14) for fastening a component (12) to the vehicle 

panel (14). The nut has a body with an opening (20) for 
receiving a bolt (22) to fasten the component (12) to the 

panel (14) and a plug (34) in the body opening (20) sealing 
the opening to prevent ingress of moisture, dust, fumes and 

other contaminants to the panel (14) through the body 
opening (20). A method for forming a vehicle panel with the 

preplugged fastener (22) includes forming the vehicle panel 
(14), forming a nut having a body (10) opening for receiving 

a bolt (22) to fasten the bracket (12) to the panel (14), 
forming a plug (34), inserting the plug (34) into the body 

opening (20) of the nut (10) and plugging the body opening 
(20) to thereby prevent ingress of contaminants through the 

panel (14) to the body opening (20) after the nut is 
installed, and fastening the nut to the vehicle panel with 

the bolt.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates generally to automotive 
manufacturing, and, more particularly, to a method and 
apparatus for manufacturing a vehicle panel for attachment 
of optional or accessory components. In automotive manufacturing, it is necessary to 
provide accessory components to accommodate demand for such 
equipment. To efficiently utilise materials, automotive 
manufacturers use mass production techniques wherein a 
single component is designed for use on many different 
products by making adaptations for particular products and 
provisions for various optional or accessory equipment. 
There are occasions where a fastener is required for 
attaching an optional or accessory item or for attaching a 
bracket for mounting a particular item. Typically, the 
location of the fastener, if needed, will be known and the 
structural member of the automobile is adapted for adding 
it. Automobiles are constructed using sheet metal of 
various thicknesses and configurations which sometimes 
remains as a sheet and sometimes is formed into a channel or 
a box configuration for the particular purpose needed. A 
member may be pre-punched with openings at each location 
where a bracket or other component may be added at some 
point during the manufacturing process. One method of attaching a bracket for fastening 
accessory equipment to a vehicle panel involves the use of a 
pierce nut which pierces the metal panel and attaches itself 
to the panel for receiving a fastener that will attach the 
bracket to the panel. In the past, it was common to attach 
the pierce nuts during assembly at each point on a panel 
that a nut may be required. Unfortunately, attaching a 
pierce nut provides a passageway for the ingress of moisture 
and other contaminants which could corrode or otherwise 
damage the panel to which it attaches as well as damage  
 
other parts of the vehicle. Accordingly, it will be 
appreciated that it will be highly desirable to have a 
fastener nut that attaches to a vehicle panel without 
deteriorating the panel or panel integrity because of the 
ingress of contaminants. Another method of attaching a bracket involves the 
use of a nut which attaches to the panel by clinching or 
crimping the panel. Such a nut may also attach to the 
vehicle panel with protrusions extending through an existing 
panel opening that are bent or crimped against the panel. 
Currently, there are several types of fasteners that are 
used, such as push nuts, sealed metal rivet nuts, solid 
pierce nuts, and conventional

<CLAIMS>
A method for forming a vehicle panel having a 
preplugged fastener for selectively attaching a vehicle 

component to said panel, comprising the steps of: 
   forming said vehicle panel with an area for attaching 

said fastener to said vehicle panel; 
   forming a nut having a body with top and bottom 

surfaces and a body opening for receiving a fastening 
member to fasten said component to said panel; 

   forming attaching means on said nut body for 
attaching said nut to said panel; 

   forming a plug; 
   inserting said plug into said body opening of said 

nut and plugging said body opening to thereby prevent 
ingress of contaminants to said panel through said body 

opening when said nut is installed; and 
   fastening said nut body to said panel with said 

attaching means after inserting said plug. 
A method as claimed in claim 1, including forming 
said plug of silicone rubber and pushing said plug out of 

said body opening in response to inserting said fastening 
member. 
A method as claimed in claim 1, including 
inserting said plug into said nut body opening so that an 

opening of said plug is positioned for receiving an end 
portion of a fastener to pilot said vehicle component onto 

said vehicle panel. 
A method as claimed in claim 1, including forming 
an offset portion on said plug for retaining said plug in 

said body opening. 
A method as claimed in claim 1, including making 
said plug flush with said top and bottom surfaces of said 

nut body. 
A method as claimed in claim 5, including forming 
an offset portion on said plug for retaining said plug in 

said body opening. 
A method for forming preplugged nuts for 
fastening a vehicle component to a vehicle panel, comprising 

the steps of: 
   forming nuts, each of said nuts having a body with 

top and bottom surfaces and a body opening for receiving a 
fastening member to fasten said component to said panel; 

   forming attaching means on each said body for 
attaching to said panel and fastening said body to said 

panel; 
   attaching said nuts to a carrier for dispensing one 

nut at a time; 
   forming plugs; and 

   inserting said plugs into said body openings of said 
nuts and sealing said body openings to thereby prevent 

ingress of contaminants to said panel through said body 
openings after said nuts are installed. 
A method as claimed in claim 7, including 
inserting said plugs into said nut body openings so that 

said plugs protrude from said nuts for engaging openings in 
said panel and piloting said nuts onto said panel. 
A nut for fastening an attaching member to a 
panel of a vehicle, comprising: 

   a body having top and bottom surfaces (16, 18) and a 
body opening (20) for receiving a fastening member (22) to 

fasten said attaching member (12) to said panel (14); 
   means (30) on said body for attaching to said panel 

and fastening said body to said panel; and
 

   a plug (34) in said body opening (20) sealing said 
opening and preventing ingress of contaminants to said 

panel through said body opening. 
A nut as claimed in claim 9, wherein said panel 
has a panel opening and wherein said plug protrudes from
