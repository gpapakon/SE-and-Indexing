<ABSTRACT>
A process for preparing a nitroaniline derivative comprising a 
step of reacting an aromatic nitro compound with an 

O-alkylhydroxylamine or a salt thereof in the presence of a base and 
optionally a metallic catalyst, which process is industrially 

advantageous since it provides the nitroaniline derivative from the 
aromatic nitro compound in a high yield in one step, and the aminating 

agent used can be obtained from hydroxylamine at a relatively low 
cost.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a process for preparing a 
nitroaniline derivative by direct amination of an aromatic nitro 
compound using an O-alkylhydroxylamine or a salt thereof. Nitroaniline derivatives are hitherto known to be precursors 
of aromatic diamines and hence very important compounds as raw 
materials and intermediates for medicines, agrochemicals, dyes, 
additives, etc. It is long known to prepare nitroanilines industrially, 
for example, by the nitration of acetanilide derivatives, or the 
amination of halogenated or hydroxylated nitrobenzene derivatives. 
However, the processes have many problems that they require many 
reaction steps, severe reaction conditions and the treatment of waste 
acids. The direct amination of aromatic nitro compounds which is 
the simplest process for preparing the nitroaniline derivatives is 
being studied in various ways. However, it is not industrially 
practical in terms of generality and cost. For example, there are 
known the process in which 1-nitronaphthalene is directly aminated 
with hydroxylamine in the presence of potassium hydroxide to obtain 4 - 
nitro-1 -naphthylamine (see Org. Synth., Coll. Vol. 3, 664 (1955)), the 
process in which nitrobenzene couples with aniline in the presence of  
 
tetramethylammonium hydroxide to obtain 4-nitrodiphenylamine and 4 - 
nitrosodiphenylamine (see J. Am. Chem. Soc., Vol. 114, 9237 (1992) and 
US Patent No. 5,117,063), the process in which nitrobenzenes react 
with 4-amino-1,2,4-triazole in the presence of a base (see J. Org. 
Chem., Vol. 51, 5039 (1986) and Vol. 53, 3978 (1988)), and the process 
in which nitrobenzenes react with sulfenamide in the presence of a 
base (see J. Org. Chem., Vol. 57, 4784 (1992)). However, the first two processes are disadvantageous in that 
raw materials are limited to the compounds described and hence they 
cannot be used as general processes. The other processes use the very 
expensive aminating agents which have high molecular weights and are 
required in the amount of more than one equivalent, so that they have 
to be recovered and reused. Therefore, the processes are difficult to 
be practically used in the industries. The process in which nitrobenzene reacts with benzamide in 
the presence of tetramethylammonium hydroxide is also known (see J. 
Org. Chem., Vol. 58, 6883(1993)). However, the process has many 
problems in the practical use that, since an amide is formed as an 
intermediate in the process, it should be hydrolyzed to obtain an 
amine, and that benzamide
