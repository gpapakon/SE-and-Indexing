<ABSTRACT>
A soil-working combination (1) with at least two soil-working appliances (2, 3, 4) which succeed one another in the working direction and of which the first (2) can be connected directly to a traction machine, possesses, so that, on the one hand, the latter can be adapted at only a low outlay to diverse requirements by means of conventional appliances, is of simple construction and is therefore cost-effective to produce and has a comparatively small constructional length with an overall centre of gravity located at a distance in front of the supporting wheels, on the frame (5) of the first soil-working appliance a rigidly arranged additional frame (6) which is carried by supporting wheels fastened to the additional frame and vertically adjustable to the latter. At least two coupling linkages (27, 41) for the connection of further soil-working appliances (3, 4) are provided on the additional frame (6).

<CLAIMS>
A soil-cultivation combination (1) with at least two soil-cultivation implements (2, 3, 4)
following in succession in the working direction id the first (2) of which can be directly

connected to a tractor, 
characterized in that
 an additional frame (6) is mounted rigidly
on the frame (5) of the first soil-cultivation implement (2), and is supported at least

during working by support wheels (14) secured to the additional frame (6) id is vertically
adjustable with respect thereto, at least two coupling linkages (27, 41) for attaching

further soil-cultivation implements (3, 4) are provided on the additional frame (6), and
the coupling linkages (27, 41) are vertically adjustable relative to the additional frame

(6).

characterized in that
 the additional
frame (6) is U-shaped at the rear end thereof, and the coupling linkages (27, 41)

are arranged at one end on the ends of the longitudinal supports (21, 22) and at the other
end on transverse supports (23) of the additional frame (6) which connect the longitudinal

supports (21, 22).

A soil-cultivation combination according to one of Claims 1 to 3, 
characterized in that

the upper control arm (26) of the coupling linkage (27) situated in front in the direction
of travel is arranged on a projection (24) connected to a transverse support (23), and the

upper control arm (42) of the coupling linkage (41) situated at the rear is arranged on a
bridge (43) engaging over the ends of the longitudinal supports (21, 22).
A soil-cultivation combination according to one of Claims 1 to 4, 
characterized in that

the front and/or rear lower control arms (28, 39, 40) of the coupling linkages (27, 41) are
supported in a sprung manner with respect to the additional frame (6).
A soil-cultivation combination according to one of Claims 1 to 5, 
characterized in that

the lower control arms of the rear coupling linkages (41) are each supported in a sprung
manner with respect to the frame of the leading soil-cultivation implement (3). 
A soil-cultivation combination according to one of Claims 1 to 6, 
characterized in that

the pivoting path of the front and rear coupling linkages (27, 41) is limited at the bottom
by stops.
A soil-cultivation combination according to Claim 7, 
characterized in that
 the stops are
adjustable.
A soil-cultivation combination according to one of Claims 1 to 8, 
characterized in that

at least the coupling linkages (41) situated at the rear have their own lifting device (46).
A soil-cultivation combination according to one of Claims 1 to 9, 
characterized in that

the additional frame (6) is releasably connected to the frame (5) of the first soil-cultivation
implement (2).
A soil-cultivation combination according to Claim 10, 
characterized in that
 the additional
frame (6) is connected to the frame (5) of the first soil-cultivation implement (2)

by way of a flanged connexion (55, 56).
A soil-cultivation combination according to one of Claims 1 to 11, 
characterized in that

the front soil-cultivation implement (2) is a disc harrow, a rotary-spade harrow, a cultivator
or a combination of the aforesaid implements.
A soil-cultivation combination according to one of Claims 1 to 11, 
characterized in that

a roller, in particular a roller tiller, is attached to the first coupling linkage (27).
A soil-cultivation combination according to Claim 13, 
characterized in that
 a two-row
rotary harrow (51) is arranged between the first coupling linkage (27) and the roller (3).
A soil-cultivation combination according to Claim 14, 
characterized in that
 both the
rotary harrow (51) and the roller (3) are supported in a sprung manner with respect to the

coupling linkage (27) thereof.
A soil-cultivation combination according to one of Claims 1 to 15, 
characterized in that

a seeding machine (4) is attached to the second coupling linkage (41).
