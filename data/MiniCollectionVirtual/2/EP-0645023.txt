<ABSTRACT>
Copolymers of acrylonitrile and vinylidene chloride are used as selective diffusion interlayers in dye-diffusive photothermographic imaging constructions. The interlayers have sufficient permeability to be useful for constructions in which cationic dyes must be diffused from an emulsion layer into an image-receiving layers, but have insufficient permeability to the unoxidized leuco dye precursor. Use of these interlayers in multicolor dye-diffusive imaging constructions increases image stability and color separation in the final image.

<DESCRIPTION>
 IMAGΈABLE ARTICLES HAVING DYESELECTIVE INTERLAYERSFIELD OF THE INVENTIONThis invention relates to photothermographic materials and in particular, it relates to dry silver systems capable of producing colored images.BACKGROUND OF THE ART Imaging systems capable of producing multiple colors often rely upon barrier interlayers to separate adjacent imaging chemistries. In some cases, such as those in which a dye image is formed and diffused to a receiving layer, the interlayer must not only separate imaging chemistries, but be permeable to dyes as well. Dry silver based imageable articles are one type of imaging system that employ interlayers in this manner.Dry silver compositions or emulsions are photothermographic compositions and contain a Iight-insensitive, reducible silver source; a light-sensitive silver source; and a reducing agent for the light-insensitive, reducible silver source. The light-sensitive material is generally photographic silver halide which must be in catalytic proximity to the light-insensitive, reducible silver source. Catalytic proximity requires an intimate physical association of these two materials so that when silver specks or nuclei are generated by the irradiation or light exposure of the photographic silver halide, those nuclei are able to catalyze the reduction of the Iight-insensitive, reducible silver source by the reducing agent. It has been long understood that silver halide is a catalyst for the reduction of silver ions and that the silver-generating, light-sensitive silver halide catalyst progenitor may be placed into catalytic proximity with the silver source in a number of different fashions, such as by partial metathesis of the light-insensitive, reducible silver source with a halogen-containing source; coprecipitation of silver halide and light-insensitive, reducible silver source material; and other methods that intimately associate the silver halide and the silver source. 

 In both photographic and photothermographic emulsions, exposure of the photographic silver halide to light produces small clusters of silver atoms. The image-wise distribution of these clusters of silver atoms is known in the art as a latent image as this latent image generally is not visible by ordinary means and the light-sensitive article must be further processed in order to produce a visual image. The visual image is produced by the catalytic reduction of silver ions which are in catalytic proximity to the silver halide grains bearing the latent image.In color dry silver imaging
