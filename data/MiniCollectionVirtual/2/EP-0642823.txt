<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a process for the 
recovery of raw materials in the aspartame preparation 

process by use of a nanofiltration membrane process from 
aqueous process streams also containing dissolved salt by 

subjecting each of the aqueous process streams or a 
combination of two or more of such streams to nanofiltration 

with the aid of a composite membrane with specific retention 
for components above 100D and for monovalent salts, the raw 

materials present in the retentate so obtained being 
recovered by a manner known in the art or the retentate 

being returned to the aspartame preparation process without 
any further processing. The invention also relates to 

apparatus for carrying out that process.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a process for the
recovery of raw materials occurring in processes for the preparation
of aspartame
or other dipeptide sweeteners
by use of a nanofiltration membrane process from
aqueous process streams also containing dissolved salt.Aspartame, the α-dipeptide ester L-aspartyl-L-phenylalanine
methyl ester ("APM"), is an important
synthetic low-calorie sweetening agent which is about 200
x as sweet as sugar and has an exceptionally good taste
pattern without, for instance, a bitter aftertaste. The
sweetener is used as such in a wide range of products such
as soft drinks, sweets, table-top sweeteners,
pharmaceutical products and the like. Aspartame can be
prepared by various known routes. There exist, for
instance, routes whereby (N-protected) L-aspartic acid or
the anhydride thereof and (L-)phenylalanine or the methyl
ester thereof are chemically coupled, the protecting group
optionally being removed later and APM being obtained by
esterification. Examples of such processes are disclosed
in, for instance, US-A-3,786,039. There also exist
enzymatic processes whereby, for instance, N-protected L-aspartic
acid and (DL-)phenylalanine methyl ester are
selectively coupled to form the LL-dipeptide derivative
and subsequently converted to APM. Such a process is
described in, for instance, US-A-4,116,768.Accordingly, as starting materials in aspartame
preparation processes use is often made of raw materials
such as L-aspartic acid ("Asp"), L-aspartic anhydride 
("AspAnh"), N-protected derivatives thereof with
protecting groups such as formyl ("F") and
benzyloxycarbonyl ("Z"), for instance F-AspAnh and Z-Asp,
L- or DL-phenylalanine ("Phe") and the methyl ester
thereof ("PM"). These starting materials are not all fully
converted in the various aspartame preparation processes
or are formed again through decomposition in downstream
steps in the preparation in addition to other
decomposition products such as 3-benzyl-6-carboxymethyl-2,5-diketopiperazine
("DKP") or L-aspartyl-L-phenylalanine
("AP") and in addition to any undesired by-products such
as the β-form of APM (β-APM) and products in which the
free carboxyl group of the aspartyl part of the dipeptide
or the dipeptide ester has esterified, which are also
referred to as AP(M) and APM2. As a rule, for reasons of
process economy, aspartame processes involve a large
number of recirculation streams.
During the preparation of aspartame, especially in the
working-up and recovery thereof, the process streams,
including the streams involved in

Process for the recovery of raw materials occurring in
processes for the preparation of aspartame or other dipeptide

sweeteners from aqueous process
streams also containing dissolved salt, wherein

each of the aqueous process streams or a
combination of two or more of such streams having a

salt content of at least 1% by weight is subjected to
nanofiltration

at a pH of 8-11 and a temperature of between 0 and 80°C
with the aid of a composite membrane with

a retention of 50 to 100% for components having a
molecular weight higher than 100D, and which gives a retention

of +20 to -40% for monovalent salts

present in the retentate so obtained being recovered
or the retentate being re
turned to the aspartame
or dipeptide sweetener preparation process without

any further processing.
Process according to Claim 1, characterized in that the
composite membrane contains a substantially negatively

charged top layer which is applied to an
ultrafiltration membrane as a support layer.
Process according to any one of Claims 1 or 2,
characterized in that the pressure at the feed side of

the membrane is superatmospheric.
Process according to Claim 3, characterized in that the
pressure has a value of from 1-5 MPa (10 to 50 bar) abs.
Process according to any one of Claims 1-4,
characterized in that the dissolved salt is a 

monovalent salt.
Process according to any one of Claims 1-5,
characterized in that the membrane is periodically

cleaned by flushing with water or a caustic solution,
optionally in the presence of a small amount of

surfactant.
Process according to any one of Claims 1-6,
characterized in that in the course of the

nanofiltration process water or a buffer solution is
added to the retentate and nanofiltration is continued.
