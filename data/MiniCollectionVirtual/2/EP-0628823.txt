<ABSTRACT>
A dispensation module adapted to supply in order reaction trays each of which has a plurality of wells, and 
dispense a specimen to the reaction trays on the basis of set specimen information, a sample processing module adapted 

to dispense, on the basis of the set specimen information, a reaction reagent, which corresponds to a measurement 
item for a specimen, in the corresponding well, and transfer the specimen while retaining the same at a constant 

temperature, and a detecting module adapted to dispense a reaction measuring reagent in each well in the reaction 
trays on the basis of the set specimen information, and having a means for measuring the luminescent intensity are 

provided in an adjacently lines state. A walking beam mechanism, which is adapted to transfer reaction trays slidingly 
and intermittently, is employed for the transferring of the reaction trays in the sample processing module and detecting 

module. During the dispensation of reagent by the sample processing module, reagent dispensation nozzles are moved 
in the direction perpendicular to the reaction tray transfer direction and the dispensation is carried out within the 

stopping time of the intermittent sliding transfer of the reaction trays and at regular time intervals with respect to each 
well placed in a position of a set order, in a reaction tray. The measurement with the detecting module is conducted 

at regular time intervals correspondingly to each well placed in a position of the set order. The specimens dispensed 
in the wells in the reaction trays are subjected to operations from the dispensation of a reagent to the measurement 

of luminescent intensity under the same conditions at the same time intervals, so that all the specimens processed in 
large quantities can be measured accurately.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a system for measuring a 
very small amount of component in a specimen, which utilizes an 
immunoreaction and permits random access to plural samples or 
specimens to automatically carry out measurements of predetermined 
plural examination items, and more particularly to the 
system, wherein a walking-beam mechanism is selected as means 
for transferring reaction trays and an incubation is effected 
out during the transfer of the reaction trays. It has been developed various measuring systems for effecting 
a measurement of a very small amount of component in a 
specimen such as blood, urine or the like body fluid, for example 
serum. Particularly, in biochemical analyzers, there are 
many systems having so-called "random access function", namely 
reaction vessels, each accommodating the specimen, are transferred 
into an incubator to permit an addition of a predetermined 
reagent(s) at predetermined time and additional charging 
of the specimen. However, such random access type measuring systems for the 
biochemical analysis are designed to handle reactions which are 
finished within a short period of time, for instance, in fifteen 
minutes. Therefore, these systems cannot be used in immunoassays 
requiring a relatively long time, say sixty minutes involved for 
incubation prior to a detection of immunoreaction product. 
Therefore, almost all immunoassay systems use a stationary incubator. 
Namely, a specimen and and reagent(s) for immunoreaction 
are dispensed into a large number of reaction vessels 
(about 300 vessels) in the form of cell or test tube arranged in 
their stand which is transferred to the stationary incubator and 
put on a stationary rack therein to keep the same for the period 
of time required for the incubation.  Then, the stand is transferred to a processing position for 
B/F separation and a distribution of another reagent, returned 
to the incubator, and finally, taken out from the incubator to 
measure an absorbance, radio activity, intensity of luminescence 
or oxygen activity depending on a selected assay marker. According 
to this type immunoassay system, number of testings is 
limited to the number of reaction vessels to be used, and once 
the test on a specific examination item has started, next assay 
on another examination item cannot be effected, until the end of 
the former assay. Therefore, an automated immunoassay system 
having a random access function has been strongly demanded, in 
lieu of such a batch processing system. For
