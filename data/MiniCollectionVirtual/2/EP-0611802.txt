<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a styrene-based polymer 
composition. 
More specifically, it relates to a 
styrene-based polymer composition which is suitable for 
materials such as the exterior trim parts of an automobile, 
engine compartment parts, machine parts, electric and 
electronic parts, domestic kitchenware, etc. a stretched 
molding thereof and a process for efficiently producing the 
stretched molding. Heretofore, a composition which comprises a 
polyphenylene ether resin (polyphenylene oxide) (hereinafter 
referred to as "PPE") and a styrene-based polymer has been 
widely used as engineering plastics which are excellent in 
mechanical properties and heat resistance. Such compositions 
have been described in, for example, Japanese Patent 
Applications Laid-Open No. 5085/1971 and No. 39457/1972, and 
U.S. Patent No. 3,383,435. However, these compositions have serious drawbacks in 
that solvent resistance, particularly resistance to aromatic 
hydrocarbon type solvents, is little, whereby their uses are 
limited. This can be considered as an essential drawback 
belonging to the styrene-based polymer having atactic  
 
configuration as one component of the composition. Also, PPE generally has self-extinguishing properties 
and therefore, a resin composition containing PPE also has 
flame retardance to some degree. However, demands on flame 
retardance in electric and electronic fields and automobile 
fields in recent years has become increasingly severe, so 
that the above demands cannot be satisfied with the flame 
retardance due to the self-extinguishing properties which PPE 
originally has. In general, styrene-based polymers have been prepared by 
radical polymerization. The styrene-based polymers thus 
prepared have atactic configuration in streoregularity. 
However, in such styrene-based polymers, improvement in 
physical properties by stretching cannot be expected. Also, 
styrene-based polymers having isotactic configuration in 
stereoregularity have also been known and an attempt to 
stretch the polymer has been made (Polymer Chemistry, vol., 
21, p. 206 (1964)). However, the styrene-based polymers have 
slow crystallization rate and its crystalline structure is 
helical so that sufficient stretching effect cannot be 
essentially obtained. The group of the present inventors' has proposed a 
process for producing a film-like molding by stretching a 
styrene-based polymer having mainly syndiotactic 
configuration and a resin composition comprising the above 
styrene-based polymer and other
