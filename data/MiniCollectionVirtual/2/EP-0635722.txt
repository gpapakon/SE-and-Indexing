<ABSTRACT>
A method for antenatal screening for chromosomal 
abnormalities in which a maternal body fluid from a 

pregnant women is measured for the level of at least one 
marker and/or a precursor or metabolite of said marker 

and the measured level of this marker together with the 
gestational age of the pregnant woman are compared to 

reference values at various gestational ages of the level 
for the marker in (a) pregnant women carrying foetuses 

having the abnormalitie(s) subject to the screen and (b) 
pregnant women carrying normal foetuses, the comparison 

being indicative of the risk of the pregnant woman 
carrying a foetus with an abnormality subject to the 

screen characterised in that the level of the marker is 
affected by maternal age and in making the comparison 

allowance is made for the age of the pregnant woman.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a method for antenatal
screening for chromosomal abnormalities and to an
apparatus for performing the method and in particular to
a method and apparatus for antenatal screening for Down's
Syndrome.The risk of Down's Syndrome and some other
chromosomal abnormalities in a foetus is known to
increase with the age of the mother and it is this
knowledge which forms the basis for selection of pregnant
women for further investigation. Further investigation
for instance in the case of Down's Syndrome involves
sampling of the amniotic fluid by amniocentesis, a
procedure which itself carries a risk for the mother of
the foetus, induction of a miscarriage being a recognised
hazard of this procedure.Maternal serum and other markers for Down's Syndrome
are widely used for antenatal screening for this
chromosomal abnormality, the most common of these markers
being alpha-fetoprotein (AFP), human chorionic
gonadotropin (hCG) - either the intact molecule thereof
or its beta subunit - and unconjugated estriol (UE).
Disclosures relating to the use of these markers in
antenatal screening for Down's Syndrome include US Patent
4,874,693, WO 89/00696 and WO 90/08325.Maternal serum screening is based on selecting a
subgroup of women who are at the greatest risk of giving
birth to a child with an abnormality, in whom the risks
of an invasive diagnostic procedure are considered to be
outweighed by the risk of the abnormality. The risk is
calculated by multiplying the a priori age related risk
by the likelihood ratio. The likelihood ratio is
calculated from the relative frequencies of the
multivariate Gaussian distribution functions of marker
analytes in affected and unaffected pregnancies, 
corresponding to the value of the individual serum marker
concentrations.Since the concentrations of the various analytes
vary with gestational age, the analyte concentrations
must be normalised. This is performed by dividing the
concentration of the analyte by the median concentration
expected for that particular gestational age in women
with unaffected pregnancies. This is termed the multiple
of the median (MoM).The use of two or more markers together in antenatal
screening can be advantageous. For example the markers
AFP, hCG and UE can be used together. The combination of
marker analytes gives significantly more information than
is given by any single marker alone, or by the group of
markers when used sequentially. The use of likelihood
ratios derived from a multivariate combination is an
efficient means of

A method for antenatal screening for
chromosomal abnormalities in which a maternal body fluid

from a pregnant woman is measured for the level of at
least one marker and/or a precursor or metabolite of said

marker and the measured level of this marker together
with the gestational age of the pregnant woman are

compared to reference values at various gestational ages
of the level for the marker in (a) pregnant women

carrying foetuses having the abnormalitie(s) subject to
the screen and (b) pregnant women carrying normal

foetuses, the comparison being indicative of the risk of
the pregnant woman carrying a foetus with an abnormality

subject to the screen characterised in that the level of
the marker is affected by maternal age and, in making the

comparison, allowance is made for the age of the pregnant
woman.
A method according to claim 1 characterised in
that a chromosomal abnormality which is screened for is

Down Syndrome.
A method according to claim 1 or claim 2
characterised in that chromosomal abnormalities screened

for include at least one of Edwards Syndrome (Trisomy
18), Pateaus Syndrome (Trisomy 13), Turner Syndrome,

Monosomy X and Kleinefelter's Syndrome.
A method according to any one of the preceding
claims characterised in that the marker to be measured is

unconjugated estriol (UE).
A method according to any one of claims 1 to 3
characterised in that the marker to be measured is DHEAS

or 16-alpha-hydroxy DHEAS. 
A method according to any one of the preceding
claims characterised in that measurement of an additional

marker is included.
A method according to any one of the preceding
claims characterised in that measurements are made on a

sample of a body fluid taken in the period between the
beginning of the eighth week and the end of the

thirteenth week of gestation.
A method according to any one of the preceding
claims characterised in that the maternal body fluid is

blood and the marker is a serum marker.
An apparatus comprising means adapted for
receiving measurements of a pregnant woman's maternal

body fluid level of at least one marker and/or a
precursor or metabolite of said marker and computer means

for comparing the measurements of this level to sets of
reference data to determine fetal chromosomal

abnormalities characterised in that the level of the
mark

comprises means for adjusting the marker level

measurements to take account of this.
