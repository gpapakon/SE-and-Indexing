<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a choke coil, the impedance of which can be matched within certain limits to a predetermined impedance, and a process for setting the impedance of the choke coil of the invention. The choke coil of the invention can be used, for instance, in fluorescent lamp ballasts. The core stack of the choke coil is constructed in layers with each layer made up of two C-shaped and one I-shaped lamination. The ends of the C-shaped lamination are in opposite pairs and bonded together on one side. The ends of the C-shaped laminations opposite the bonded ends have a stop device which ensures that, after these ends have been pressed together, they are at a fixed distance apart determined by the compressive force. The impedance of the choke coil can be matched to a predetermined value by pressing the C-shaped laminations of the core stack together.

Inductance coil with impedance adjustment comprising
 
a set of cores built up in layers and a retaining device (30) in which each 

layer of the core set is made up of two essentially C-shaped ferromagnetic 
plates (21, 22) and one essentially I-shaped ferromagnetic plate (23) in such 

a way that the two C-shaped plates (21,22) surround two winding windows 
(24,25) and the I-shaped plate (23) separating the windows, and the ends of 

the C-shaped plates (21,22) face each other in pairs, whereby the C-shaped 
plates (21,22) are securely joined to a first pair of opposite ends and are 

held on the second pair by the retaining device (3) at a distance which can 
be adjusted as a function of a force which presses the ends (42, 43) togeth
er, 
whereby the retaining device (30) is formed by inwards opening undercuts (44, 

45) on the opposite end faces (40,41) of the second pair of opposite ends 
(42,43) of the C-shaped plates (21,22) and a filler (47) which has plastic 

deformation and which is placed between the undercuts, whereby after the 
second pair of opposite ends (42,43) of the C-shaped plates (21,22) are 

pressed together due to the interaction with the undercuts (44,45), the filler 
produces a secure retention facility for the second pair of opposite ends 

(42,43) of the C-shaped plates (21,22). 
Inductance coil with impedance adjustment accordinq to Claim 1,
characterized in that
 
the undercuts (44,45) are recesses which are circular sector in shape. 
Inductance coil with impedance adjustment according to Claim 1
characterized in that
 
the undercuts (44, 45) are trapezoidal-shaped recesses. 
Inductance coil with impedance adjustment according to one of the Claims 
1 to 3,
characterized in that
  
 

the ductile filler (47) consists of copper or aluminium. 
Inductance coil with impedance adjustment according to one of the Claims 
1 to 4,
characterized in that
 
the retaining device (30) is positioned in an area which has little magnetic 

flux flowing through it. 
Inductance coil with impedance adjustment according to one of the Claims 
1 to 5,
characterized in that
 
the secure connection to the first pair of opposite ends of the C-shaped 

plates is produced by means of a plate (5) which is clamp-like in design.
