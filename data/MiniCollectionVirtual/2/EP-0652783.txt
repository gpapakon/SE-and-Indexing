<ABSTRACT>
A pharmaceutical dispenser includes a housing (4), containing two pharmaceutical cartridges (32, 34), slidably mounted to a sliding body (100). A replaceable needle manifold assembly (10) is mounted to the housing and fluidly couples the cartridges with a hypodermic needle at a common exit. The sliding body is part of a reciprocating drive assembly used to drive a pair of drive stems (88) against the pistons (96, 98) of the cartridges, thus forcing predetermined amounts of the pharmaceuticals out the needle. The movement of the sliding body between retracted and post-injection positions remains constant. However, the amounts and proportions of the pharmaceuticals injected during the delivery stroke is chosen by the user using stroke adjusters (182) carried by the sliding body. A bistable status flag (186) is mounted to the sliding body to indicate when the sliding body is in the post-injection and retracted positions. If a dose selected is more than is available, the status flag is not tripped.

<DESCRIPTION>
Frequently a physician will prescribe two or more
medications to be taken by a patient either simultaneously or
as close to simultaneously as practical. This is often the
case in prescribing insulin. Two basic types of insulin are
most frequently prescribed: regular, a fast-acting variety, and
NPH, an intermediate-acting variety. Additionally, a longer-acting
type of insulin called ultralente is also available.
These types of insulin differ in their onset and duration of
action. Regular insulin typically has the quickest onset and
the briefest duration of action. The onset and duration of
insulin may be modified by chemical manipulations which include
precipitation with protamine or suspension with isophane or
zinc. Injectable insulin is derived from pigs and cattle, and
a semi-synthetic genetically-engineered human form is available
commercially.Regardless of the final chemical composition or
origin of the insulin prescribed, the physician frequently
advises the patient to mix two or more types of insulin and to
inject them at least once a day. Some patients respond best to
a schedule of two or three daily doses, usually in conjunction
with meals. Frequently trial-and-error type of evaluation is
practiced to arrive at the correct dosing and combination for
the individual patient. However, after this initial adjustment
period, the patient may be maintained on the same dose and
proportion of insulins for many weeks or months assuming that
the patient's diet, activity, and state of health remain
reasonably constant or predictable. An example of a typical
mixture and ratio of insulins is 70% NPH and 30% regular
insulin injected just prior to a meal.The implications of insulin therapy for the patient
generally include the need for two separate sets of insulin 
injection syringes and needles. This is because the patient
will usually draw a predetermined amount of insulin from each
of two vials. A sophisticated patient may be able to use a
single syringe and simply draw up the correct amount from each
separate insulin vial. However, he may prefer to use two
separate needles because of the danger of mixing two types of
insulin by using a needle "contaminated" with one type of
insulin and accidentally getting some of the first insulin into
the second vial from which he draws the second insulin. If the
patient is not sophisticated or not adept at drawing up insulin
from a vial into a syringe, he would need two needles and two
syringes. He may find that he has drawn up too much insulin
and then he wishes to

A fluid dispenser comprising:

a housing (4);
first and second variable volume containers (32, 34)
mounted to the housing and including first and second exits and first and

second movable elements by which the contents of the containers can be
forced through said respective exits as the movable elements (96, 98) are

moved within said variable volume containers;
a pair of drive stems (88) for and drivingly coupled to each of
the movable elements, each drive stem including an axially extending

drive surface (169);
a reciprocating drive assembly, movable between a post-injection
position and a retracted position, for driving the drive stems so

as to drive the movable elements within said variable volume containers in
at least a first cycle, the drive assembly including:
a one-way drive device, including one-way drive elements
(164), drivingly coupled to the drive stems (88) along the drive surfaces by

the one-way drive elements; and
a pair of dose adjusters (102) for adjusting the relative distance
the driver and stems associated therewith travel during a cycle of

the driver; characterized by
an indicator (186) coupled to said housing, movable between a
first position, while said drive assembly is in said retracted position, and a

second position in response to movement of said drive assembly substantially
fully to said post-injection position.
A dispenser, as claimed in claim 1, characterized
in that said indicator (108) comprises a status flag pivotally

mounted to the drive assembly at a pivot point (190). 
A dispenser, as claimed in claim 2, characterized
by a spring (192) positioned adjacent the pivot point (190) and

oriented to bias the status flag to either of the post-injection
and retracted positions; and


a pair of spring engaging elements (198) carried
by the housing and positioned to engage and deflect the spring

(192) when the reciprocating drive assembly is moved to the post-injection and
the retracted positions.
A dispenser, as claimed in claim 2, characterized
by a status window (208) associated with the housing, the flag

being visible through the status window when the reciprocating drive assembly
is in one of the post-injection and retracted positions, the flag

being not visible through the status window when the reciprocating drive
assembly is in the other of the post-injection and retracted

positions.
The dispenser of claim 1, characterized by a post-injection
latch (84) mounted to the housing and engagable with

the reciprocating drive assembly which, in response to moving the
reciprocating drive

assembly to the post-injection position, secures the reciprocating drive
assembly in the post-injection position until a user releases

said post-injection latch.
The dispenser of claim 1, characterized by a
manifold (10) having at least a portion moveable to a first

position to define a fluid path from the first and second exits
to a common exit.
The dispenser of claim 6, characterized in that
said dose adjusters (102) include means (104, 106) for

individually adjusting the amount each of said drive stems moves
during each cycle of the reciprocating drive assembly, each individually

adjusting means including a dose control element (114) by which a
user selects said amounts of the contents of the respective 

containers forced through the first and second exits.
The dispenser of claim 7, characterized in that
the manifold (10) includes a latch (48,50) movable from a first

position holding the manifold to the housing to a second position
allowing the manifold to separate from the housing.
The dispenser of claim 1, characterized in that
the drive stems (88) have a stop surface positioned to engage

said reciprocating drive assembly to prevent movement thereof when
said reciprocating drive

assembly has driven said stems a predetermined amount so that the
stroke determined by said dose adjusters (102) exceeds the

effective remaining length of said variable volume containers.
The dispenser of claim 1, characterized by means
(166, 228, 230, 232) for selectively separating at least a

portion of the housing and therewith the variable volume
containers (32,34) from the remainder of the dispenser to permit

the user to change the variable volume containers.
The dispenser of claim 1, characterized in that
the drive surface (169) of each drive stem (88) is at least

partially defined by an axially extending slot (90) formed in the
drive stem, the one-way drive elements (164) include a spring arm

(166) positioned at an acute angle to the drive surface, the
spring arm engaging the drive surface, and further characterized

by means for selectively releasing the one-way drive elements
(164) from each drive stem (88), the selectively releasing means

including a releasing member (158, 228) mounted coaxially within
the reciprocating driver and adapted to selectively engage the

spring arm (166) so to deflect said spring arm away from the
drive surface.
The dispenser of claim 1, characterized by means
(84) for sensing when said drive stems (8) have moved a 

predetermined amount and for preventing movement of said
reciprocating drive

assembly to said retracted position in response to said sensing,
said predetermined amount being controlled by movement of said

dose adjusters (102).
