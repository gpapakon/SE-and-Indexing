<ABSTRACT>
A paper machine dryer fabric includes hollow thermoplastic monofilaments to replace at least a portion of the wefts, also known as cross-machine direction strands. Fabrics including such monofilaments may be either a woven fabric, or a spiral fabric. The deformable nature of the hollow monofilaments decreases the air permeability of the fabric, and in the case of spiral fabrics, improves monofilament retention within the helical coils between the hinge yarns. The hollow monofilaments have a solidity in the range of from about 50 % to about 80 %. A suitable thermoplastic is polyethylene terephthalate. Hollow monofilaments do not have the disadvantages of other deformable yarns, such as spun yarns, multifilament yarns or plied monofilament yarns, each of which tend to hold and entrap within their structure both water and foreign matter.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to fabrics intended for use in 
the manufacture of paper and like products, in which hollow 
monofilaments replace at least a portion of the wefts, also known 
as cross-machine directions strands. The invention is 
particularly applicable to paper machine dryer fabrics. The primary function of a dryer fabric is to hold the 
paper web in contact with the heated surfaces of the dryer 
cylinders. This increases the efficiency of heat transfer and 
improves the flatness of the paper. An important property of dryer fabrics intended for use 
in modern, high-speed paper making machines is low permeability 
to air flow. Dryer fabrics must have low air permeabilities so 
as to prevent sheet flutter and, ultimately, breakage of the 
sheet (as documented by Race, Wheeldon, et al. in TAPPI, vol. 51, 
no. 7, July 1968). Low air permeability values may be considered 
to be those in the range of 127 cm3/cm2.s (250 ft3/min/ft2) or 
below. It is also desirable that the air permeability of the 
fabric be constant throughout both the fabric itself, and its 
operational life. It is difficult to obtain low air permeabilities in 
woven dryer fabrics when solid monofilaments are used as the weft 
strands. Manufacturers of dryer fabrics have thus traditionally 
resorted to incorporating spun yarns, multifilament yarns or 
plied monofilaments in order to obtain low air permeabilities in 
conventional dryer fabric designs. These types of yarns, 
however, make it difficult to accurately control fabric air 
permeability during manufacture. They also allow foreign matter 
to become entrapped in the fabric, which changes the air 
permeability of the fabric throughout its life on the paper 
making machine. Trapped contaminants are usually distributed  
 
unevenly in the fabric, and will cause uneven drying of the paper 
web. The use of spun yarns, multifilament yarns, or plied 
monofilaments in dryer fabrics also reduces the efficiency with 
which water is evaporated out of the paper web, because water 
tends to condense and be retained within such yarns. Another method of lowering fabric air permeability is 
to use machine direction strands that are essentially rectangular 
in cross-section. Such a method is disclosed by Buchanan et al. 
in US 4,290,209. This patent also discloses the use of shaped 
or hollow monofilaments as weft strands to further reduce dryer 
fabric air permeability. However, it does not teach the critical 
physical parameters required for the hollow monofilaments, such 
as strand
