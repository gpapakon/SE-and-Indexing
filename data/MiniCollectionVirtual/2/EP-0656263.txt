<ABSTRACT>
A printer main body (10) is provided having a print
section (A) therein for printing and a sheet feed inlet (B) through

which paper (P) is supplied to the print section. An automatic
sheet feeder (30) is releasably mountable substantially at

position for releasably mounting a manual sheet insertion
guide (20) so that each can feed paper through the sheet feed

inlet (B). The manual sheet insertion guide (20) is also releasably
mountable on the automatic sheet feeder, preferable at an

angle at which sheets can be fed through said sheet feed
inlet (B).

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates generally to a printer and,
more particularly, to a printer capable of attaching an
automatic sheet feeder thereto in place of a manual sheet
insertion guide by removing the manual sheet insertion guide
therefrom.Printers that allow a manual sheet insertion guide to
be removed therefrom and an automatic sheet feeder, which is
an optional unit, to be attached thereto in place of the
removed manual sheet insertion guide have heretofore been
well known. However, these printers of the prior art have
generally suffered from the problem that the removed manual
sheet insertion guide can be lost when the automatic sheet
feeder is attached.A common method of overcoming this problem comprises
a printer which allows the automatic sheet feeder to be
attached to the printer while the manual sheet insertion
guide is also attached to the printer. However, this design
requires that the printer main body have a space for
receiving both the manual sheet insertion guide and the
automatic sheet feeder and space to provide paper paths for
the two paper feed arrangements, which requires a large
structure for the printer main body.Accordingly, it would be advantageous to provide a
printer which prevents a removed manual sheet insertion guide
from being lost when an automatic sheet feeder is installed
in the printer, and allows the use of a single insertion slot
for both the automatic sheet feeder and the manual sheet
insertion guide, so that the printer can remain a small
structure. Generally speaking, in accordance with the present
invention, a printer having a printer main body and a manual
sheet insertion guide is provided. The printer main body has
a print section and a sheet feed inlet for supplying a sheet
to the print section. The manual sheet insertion guide is
attached to the printer main body so as to be removable
therefrom and serves to supply a sheet to the sheet feed
inlet manually. The printer allows an automatic sheet feeder
to be attached to the printer main body in place of the
manual sheet insertion guide by removing the manual sheet
insertion guide from the printer main body. The automatic
sheet feeder is designed to receive and support the manual
sheet insertion guide, which is removed from the printer main
body, on the automatic sheet feeder after the automatic sheet
feeder is attached to the printer body.Thus, the printer performs a printing operation at
the print section on the sheet supplied from the manual sheet
insertion guide when the manual sheet insertion guide is
attached

<CLAIMS>
A printer for printing on at least sheets of
paper, comprising:


a printer main body formed with a sheet feed inlet
for the passage of sheets of paper to the interior of the

printer main body;
a print section situated within said printer main
body for printing on sheets of paper received from said sheet

feed inlet;
an automatic sheet feeder;
first coupling members in said automatic sheet feeder
and printer main body permitting releasable mounting of said

automatic sheet feeder on said printer main body to
automatically supply a plurality of said sheets of paper to

said sheet feed inlet;
a manual sheet insertion guide;
second coupling members on said manual sheet
insertion guide and said printer main body permitting

releasable mounting of said manual sheet insertion guide in
place of said automatic sheet feeder onto said printer main

body to supply individual sheets of paper to said sheet feed
inlet; and
third coupling members on said automatic sheet feeder
and said manual sheet insertion guide permitting releasable

mounting of said manual sheet insertion guide onto said
automatic sheet feeder when said automatic sheet feeder is

mounted to said printer main body.
The printer of claim 1, wherein said manual
sheet insertion guide is positioned to act as a sheet

discharge tray when mounted on said automatic sheet feeder.
The printer of claim 2, further comprising a
support rod coupled to said manual sheet insertion guide and

positioned to further support discharged sheets. 
The printer of claim 2, further comprising
paper guides mounted in lateral displacement along said

manual sheet insertion guide for laterally positioning a
sheet of paper to be manually fed, said paper guides

including paper guide side plates projecting from said manual
sheet insertion guide and paper guide top plates disposed on

the distal ends of said paper guide side plates for
supporting the discharged sheets.
The printer of claim 2, wherein said manual
sheet insertion guide is coupled to said automatic sheet

feeder at a predetermined angle which allows a sheet to be
manually supplied from said manual sheet insertion guide to

said sheet feed inlet.
The printer of claim 1, and including a tractor
feed mechanism mounted below said manual sheet insertion

guide for feeding continuous pager to said print selection,
said second coupling members permit said manual sheet

insertion guide to be pivotably displaced on said printer
main body between a first manual feed position and a second

position where it serves as a discharge tray for said
continuous paper.
The printer of claim 1, wherein said second
coupling members comprise laterally extending pin members in

said printer main body and grooves on said manual sheet
insertion guide dimensioned to be received in said grooves.
The printer of claim 1, wherein said third
coupling members comprise a pair of resilient pawl members

projecting from said manual sheet insertion guide for
operative coupling with said automatic sheet feeder. 
A method of printing, comprising the steps of:

providing a printer main body having a print section
situated within said printer main body for printing on a

sheet of paper and formed with a sheet feed inlet providing
access for a sheet of paper to said print section;
dismounting a manual sheet insertion guide from a
location in said printer main body in registration with said

sheet feed inlet at which it permitted manual feed of sheets
of paper to said print section;
releasably mounting an automatic sheet feeder to said
printer main body substantially at the position previously

occupied by said manual sheet insertion guide in registration
with said sheet feed inlet to automatically supply a

plurality of said sheets of paper to said print section; and
releasably mounting said manual sheet insertion guide
to said automatic sheet feeder.
The method of claim 9, further comprising the
step of positioning said manual sheet insertion guide on said

automatic sheet feeder so as to serve as a discharge tray for
printed paper.
The method of claim 9, including the step of

positioning said manual sheet insertion guide on said
automatic sheet feeder at an angle selected to permit manual

feed of sheets of paper through said sheet feed inlet along
said manual sheet insertion guide.
