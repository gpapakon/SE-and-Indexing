<ABSTRACT>
A method is described for the rendering of an image on a carrier by 
a rendering system having a restricted density resolution. A classic 

screening method for a binary rendering technique is extrapolated to 
a plurality of energy levels that belong to three classes : non-marking, 

non-stable and marking stable energy levels. For each 
class, specific rules must be respected, in order to obtain 

predictable results without density discontinuities on the carrier. 
The methods make full use of the spatial and density resolution of 

the rendering system in areas of high density and increase the 
reproducibility of low densities by giving up some spatial 

resolution in the lower density regions.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method and an apparatus for
the registration of images on a transparent or opaque carrier by a
rendering system having a restricted set of energy levels. The
method can be used in electrophotographic printers or copiers.Rendering systems have always a restricted spatial resolution,
which mainly depends on the addressability of the rendering system.
They also have a restricted density resolution. In the next table,
we give some specific values for the addressability and density
resolution. The addressability is expressed as the number of
available positions per linear unit, mostly dpi or "dots per inch".

method applicable to a thermal printer with thirteen energy levels.
The method assumes that the rendering system has minimally two
threshold values and as such three energy levels and enhances the
restricted density resolution by screening techniques based on a
dither matrix. The energy levels for the microdots are changed
according to specific rules when the input image level increases.
The rules are fixed for consecutive intervals of the image signal. 
The object of that method is to avoid large gradation differences.
Six rules determine each a pattern or type according to which the
energy levels are assigned in a screen cell. Some of these types are
probably advantageous for a thermal printer, but are not suited for
use in an electrophotographic process. The first pattern (type 1)
tries to achieve a smooth distribution of the thermal or
electrostatic energy around a point of high density. For
electrophotographic processes however, it is important to accentuate
the transitions from low density to high density microdots, in order
to ensure a reproducible and thus predictable density. A halftone
dot composed according to type 1 of this invention, will behave non-stable
in an electrophotographic process having different energy
levels. This is due to the outnumber of microdots having a low
density. The density changes, obtained by halftone dots according to
type 2, will be location dependent and thus be inconsistent caused
by the non-stable behaviour of the modified microdots. For higher
densities, when the electrophotographic process behaves more stable
