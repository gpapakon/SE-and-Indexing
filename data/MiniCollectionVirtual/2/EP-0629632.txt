<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention
relates to a
propylene homopolymer, a propylene copolymer and a
propylene elastomer, all having a high triad tacticity of
the propylene units chain, and low in an amount of
inversely inserted propylene units. Propylene polymers
have been applied to various uses such as industrial parts,
containers, films and nonwoven fabrics, because of their
excellent rigidity, surface hardness, heat resistance,
glossiness and transparency.However, the conventional propylene homopolymer is not
always sufficient in transparency, impact resistance, etc.
for some uses, and therefore the advent of a propylene
polymer excellent in rigidity, heat resistance, surface
hardness, glossiness, transparency and impact strength is
desired. Moreover, the physical properties of the copolymers of
propylene and an α-olefin other than propylene vary
depending on composition thereof, and hence the copolymers
are generally distinguishable from each other bordering the
monomer content derived from the α-olefin other than
propylene of 5% by mol.Propylene copolymers containing monomer units derived
from α-olefin other than propylene in an amount of less
than 5% by mol have been applied to various uses such as
containers and packaging materials (e.g., films), because
of their excellent rigidity, surface hardness, heat
resistance, transparency and heat-sealing property.
However, when the copolymer is used as a film, the
resulting film is not always sufficient in transparency,
heat-sealing property, anti-blocking property, anti-bleedout
property and impact strength. Therefore, a
propylene copolymer further improved in transparency,
rigidity, surface hardness, heat resistance and heat-sealing
property, and having excellent anti-blocking
property, anti-bleedout property and impact strength is
desired.In contrast, propylene copolymers containing monomer
units derived from α-olefin other than propylene in an
amount of more than 5% by mol have been applied to various
uses such as films, heat-sealing layers of laminated films,
and modifiers for improving impact resistance and anti-heat-sealing
property of thermoplastic resins, because of 
their excellent transparency, heat-sealing property at low
temperature, environmental aging property and impact
absorbing capacity. However, the conventional propylene
copolymer is not always sufficient in transparency, heat-sealing
properties at low temperature, anti-blocking
properties, bleedout resistance, impact strength, etc. for
some uses, and the modifiers therefrom are not always
sufficie
