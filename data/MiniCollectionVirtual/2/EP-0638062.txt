<CLAIMS>
A process for the production of reaction mixtures 
containing ester polyols by ring-opening reactions of 

epoxidized esters and/or alcohols with carboxylic acids, 
characterized in that, to obtain comparatively low-viscosity 

reaction products, the carboxylic acids are initially 
introduced in at least substantially stoichiometric 

quantities to the epoxide content of the reactant(s) and 
the epoxidized reaction component is subsequently introduced 

with such a time delay that substantial numbers of 
unreacted epoxide groups in the reaction mixture are 

avoided. 
A process as claimed in claim 1, characterized in that 
the epoxidized esters and/or alcohols are added with time 

delay to the carboxylic acids heated to temperatures above 
80°C and below 300°C and preferably to temperatures above 

100°C and below 270°C, more particularly with intensive 
stirring of the reaction mixture. 
A process as claimed in claim 1 or 2, characterized in 
that the epoxidized esters and/or alcohols are added with 

time delay to the carboxylic acids introduced in quantities 
of preferably up to 1:10, preferably in at most substantially 

equimolar quantities and, more particularly, in 
slightly less than the equimolar quantity to the carboxylic 

acids initially introduced. 
A process as claimed in any of claims 1 to 3, characterized 
in 
that the components containing epoxide groups 
are added with such a time delay that the epoxide contents 

in the reaction mixture are kept below 50% by weight. 
A process as claimed in any of claims 1 to 4, characterized 
in that excess carboxylic acid is removed from the 

ester polyol mixtures, preferably by distillation and 
in 
vacuo
. 
A process as claimed in any of claims 1 to 5, characterized 
in that preferably monobasic carboxylic acids are  

 
initially introduced for the ring-opening reaction. 
A process as claimed in any of claims 1 to 6, characterized 
in that aromatic, aliphatic, branched and/or 

unbranched carboxylic acids containing up to 40 carbon 
atoms, preferably up to 36 carbon atoms and, more preferably, 

up to 22 carbon atoms are initially introduced. 
A process as claimed in any of claims 1 to 7, characterized 
in that saturated and/or unsaturated carboxylic 

acids, more particularly unsaturated carboxylic acids, are 
initially introduced. 
A process as claimed in any of claims 1 to 9, characterized 
in that epoxidized esters preferably containing an 

average of more than one epoxide group and, more preferably, 
two and more epoxides groups per molecule are used. 
A process as claimed in any of claims 1 to 9, characterized 
in that epoxidized esters of monohydric to tetrahydric 

alcohols and preferably dihydric and/or trihydric 
alcohols and, more particularly, triglycerides are used. 
A process as claimed in any of claims 1 to 10, characterized 
in that esters of epoxidized carboxylic acids 

and/or epoxidized alcohols, preferably esters of epoxidized 
carboxylic acids and, more particularly, epoxidized fatty 

acids are used. 
A process as claimed in any of claims 1 to 11, characterized 
in that epoxidized alcohols containing 3 to 32 

carbon atoms, preferably more than 12 carbon atoms and, 
more preferably, up to 22 carbon atoms are used. 
A process as claimed in any of claims 1 to 12, characterized 
in that mixtures having viscosities up to 50% and 

preferably between 10 and 40% lower than those of mixtures 
obtained by the one-pot method are produced. 
A process as claimed in any of claims 1 to 13, characterized 
in that, on a statistical average, the ester polyol 

mixtures produced contain more than 1 and preferably more 
than 1.5 free hydroxyl groups.  

 
A process as claimed in any of claims 1 to 14, characterized 
in that the ester polyol mixtures produced preferably 

contain ester groups of the carboxylic acid initially 
introduced predominantly adjacent the free hydroxyl groups. 
Mixtures of ester polyols obtainable by the process 
claimed in claims 1 to 15, characterized in that they 

predominantly contain ester polyols containing free hydroxyl 
groups in the adjacent position to the ester group. 
Mixtures of ester polyols as claimed in claim 16, 
characterized in that they contain ester groups of C₁₋₄₀ and 

preferably C₈₋₂₂ carboxylic acids.
