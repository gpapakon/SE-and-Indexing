<ABSTRACT>
An inflatable prosthesis (10) is disclosed which 
comprises a structural member (20) having a bore dimensioned to 

receive a needle formed in its back end. An elastomeric balloon(30) 
has a back end (34) in sealing engagement with the structural 

member (20) and has a front end (32) extending beyond the front end of 
the structural member such that a portion of the structural 

member is contained within the balloon (30). A port (46) is defined in 
the structural member for placing the bore in fluid 

communication with a port location exterior of the structural 
member which is contained within the balloon (30), whereby fluid 

infused into the bore passes through the port (46) and into a space 
between the balloon (30) and the exterior surface of the structural 

member (20) to inflate the balloon (30). An elastomeric member has one 
portion attached to the structural member and another portion 

attached to the front end of the balloon so as to partially 
constrain axial expansion of the prosthesis as the balloon is 

inflated.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates generally to medical 
devices and procedures. More specifically the present invention 
relates to an inflatable prosthesis for implantation within the 
periurethral tissues of a patient to treat urinary incontinence. It is known to implant inflatable prostheses in the 
periurethral tissues of a patient to provide support to the 
urethral sphincter as a treatment for urinary incontinence. Such 
implants are described, for example, in U.S. Patent No. 
4,832,680 to Haber et al. The prostheses, similar to tiny 
balloons, are introduced into the periurethral tissues and 
positioned, one on either side of the urethra, in an uninflated 
condition. The prostheses are then inflated by infusing saline 
solution through a cannula. As the prostheses expand they exert 
pressure and cause coaptation of the urethra. The inflatable prostheses normally used for this 
procedure comprise a balloon mounted around a main body and 
anchored to the body at its rearward end. As the balloon is 
inflated, the major direction of elongation is longitudinal, that 
is, parallel to the urethra. Thus if the prostheses are not  
 
positioned closely enough to the urethra, or if the periurethral 
tissues tend to be inelastic, as in the case of scar tissue from 
previous surgery or radiation treatment, considerable additional 
inflation of the prostheses is required to result in relatively 
minor increases in coaptative pressure. Inflatable prostheses are known which expand 
primarily in a radial direction. Such prostheses are disclosed, 
for example, in U.S. Patent No. 3,834,394 to Hunter et al. 
These prostheses comprise a balloon whose opposite ends are 
linked to prevent axial elongation. As the balloon is first 
inflated, the only possible direction of expansion is radially. 
The inflatable prosthesis of the aforementioned U.S. Patent No. 
3,834,394 is disclosed only with respect to vascular 
applications. Furthermore, even though such a prosthesis might 
provide advantages in terms of enhanced lateral pressure, the 
pressure tends to be exerted at only a single point. Thus there is a need for an improved inflatable 
prosthesis which when positioned within the periurethral tissues 
will exert radial pressure against the urethra but which will 
exert that pressure along a substantial length of the urethra. There is a further need for an inflatable prosthesis 
for implanting in periurethral tissues which will expand in such 
a way as to provide a greater margin of error with respect to 
placement of the

<CLAIMS>
An inflatable prosthesis, comprising: 
   a structural member having front and back 

ends and an exterior surface and having a longitudinal bore 
formed in said back end of said structural member dimensioned 

to receive a needle therewithin; 
   an elastomeric balloon having a back end in 

sealing engagement with said structural member and having a 
front end extending beyond said front end of said structural 

member such that a portion of said structural member is 
contained within said balloon; 

   said structural member having a port defined 
therein for placing said bore in fluid communication with a port 

location exterior of said structural member which is contained 
within said balloon, whereby fluid infused into said bore passes 

through said port and into a space between said balloon and said 
exterior surface of said structural member to inflate said 

balloon; and 
   an elastomeric member having one portion 

attached to said structural member and another portion attached 
to said front end of said balloon such that said elastomeric 

member partially constrains axial expansion of said balloon as 
said balloon is inflated. 
The prosthesis of Claim 1, wherein said 
elastomeric member comprises an elastomeric tubular housing 

sealed to the perimeter of said structural member at a location 
rearward of said port location and stretched against said exterior 

surface of said structural member, said elastomeric tubular 
housing having a hole formed therethrough at a location 

removed from said port location such that fluid exiting said port 
under pressure distends said housing and passes between said 

exterior surface of said structural member and said housing to 
pass through said hole into said balloon, said elastomeric 

housing returning against said exterior surface of said structural 
member upon release of said pressure to prevent fluid from 

returning back through said port, whereby said balloon is 
maintained in an inflated state. 
The prosthesis of Claim 2, wherein said 
elastomeric tubular housing extends forward of said structural 

member, and wherein said front end of said elastomeric balloon 
is in sealing engagement with a portion of said elastomeric 

tubular housing which extends forward of said structural 
member. 
The prosthesis of Claim 3, wherein a 
silicone plug is disposed within said tubular housing forward of 

said structural member. 
The prosthesis of Claim 1, further 
comprising a felt plug bonded to a front end of said prosthesis. 
The prosthesis of Claim 1, wherein said 
structural member comprises: 

   a needle guide having a longitudinal bore 
formed therewithin and having at least one radial port formed in 

a side wall thereof; and 
   a needle guide core having a portion 

disposed within said central longitudinal bore of said needle 
guide, said needle guide core being pierceable by a needle, and 

said needle guide core having a transverse bore in 
communication with said radial port of said needle guide. 
The prosthesis of Claim 6, wherein said. 
needle guide core further comprises a portion extending 

rearward of said needle guide, and wherein said elastomeric 
member having one portion attached to said structural member 

comprises said elastomeric member having one portion attached 
to said portion of said needle guide core extending rearward of 

said needle guide.
