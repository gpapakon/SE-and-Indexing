<ABSTRACT>
A packaging laminate for a liquid-tight, configurationally stable 
packaging container possessing good fat resistance properties. 
The packaging laminate (10) has a core layer (11) of paper or 
paperboard and outer liquid-tight films or coatings (12 and 13) of 

thermoplastic, preferably polyethylene. 
Between the core layer (11) and the one outer thermoplastic film (12), 
there is a layer (14) of greaseproof paper which is bonded to the core layer 

(11) via an interjacent layer (15) of binder or sealant plastic in order to 
impart fat resistance to the packaging laminate. 
Between the core layer (11) and the second outer thermoplastic film 
(13), there is an aluminium foil (16) which is bonded to the core layer (11) 

via an interjacent layer (17) of binder or sealant plastic, whereby the 
packaging laminate is given excellent oxygen gas barrier properties.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a packaging laminate for a liquid-tight, 
configurationally stable packaging container possessing superior fat 
resistance properties, the packaging laminate including a rigid, but foldable 
core layer of paper or paperboard. Moreover, the present invention relates 
to such a packaging container produced from the packaging laminate and 
intended for edible oils. Nowadays, liquid foods of the cooking oil, or edible oil type are 
mostly packed and transported in finished consumer packages of a single-use 
disposable nature. Edible oils constitute one group of particularly 
perishable foods which require good chemical, as well as mechanical 
properties of the packaging container in order to be able to be stored with 
retained or but insignificantly diminished freshness qualities during a 
lengthy period of time. The packaging material in these so-called single use 
packages therefore most generally consists of a plurality of mutually 
laminated layers of material which together give the package its requisite 
product protection properties. A prior art packaging laminate which is often employed in single-use 
packages for edible oils and similar perishable food products includes a 
core layer of paper or paperboard which imparts to the package mechanical 
strength and configurational stability, and outer layers of plastic, preferably 
polyethylene, which give the package the requisite tightness properties 
against liquids and moreover make the packaging laminate heat-sealable 
or fusible in such a manner that mutually facing plastic layers can easily be 
sealed to one another by surface fusion, for the formation of mechanically 
strong, liquid-tight sealing joints or seams during the packaging production 
process. Moreover, such good product protection requires that the package 
is oxygen gas tight and fat resistant and, to achieve these additional 
protective properties, it has hitherto been common to modify, by chemical 
means, the paper or paperboard layer of the packaging laminate by  
 
impregnation with an organic fluorine compound which makes the 
packaging laminate fat resistant and almost impermeable for oxygen gas. A packaging laminate which employs the above-described 
chemically modified paper or paperboard layer suffers from serious 
environmental drawbacks because of the organic fluorine compound which, 
for example on the incineration of used packages, can create toxic organic 
combustion products and which, on production of the modified paper or 
paperboard

Claims, characterized in that it includes an outer film or coating (13) of 

thermoplastic disposed on the other side (corresponding to the inside of the 
packaging container) of the core layer (11). 
The packaging laminate as claimed in Claim 5, characterized in 
that said outer film or coating (13) of thermoplastic consists of polyethylene. 
The packaging laminate as claimed in any one of the preceding 
Claims, characterized in that it also includes one or more additional 

layers between the core layer (11) and the outer film or coating (13) of 
thermoplastic, for example an aluminum foil (16).
