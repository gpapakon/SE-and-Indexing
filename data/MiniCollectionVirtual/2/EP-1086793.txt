<ABSTRACT>
Mixing device has a container (10) for dry material with an inlet (8) and an outlet (9); a moisture container (11) connected to the container (10) via the outlet; a liquid inlet (14) that opens out into the moisture container; a conveyor (12) arranged in the container (10) and/or container (11) for transporting dry material between the containers; and a mixing pump connected to the outlet of the moisture container and having a cylindrical stator (21) and a rotor (22) extending axially into the stator. The stator wall has a gas inlet (24) which opens out into the inside of the stator and a gas feed device adjusts the gas amount and/or the gas pressure introduced into the stator. An Independent claim is also included for a process for the production of materials containing gas bubbles.
