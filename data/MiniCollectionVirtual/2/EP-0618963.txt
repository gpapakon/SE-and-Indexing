<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to an improved process for preparing
neuraminidase, an enzyme playing a leading role as a tool for the
biological research, for the studies concerning the cellular facies
and for the enzymatic analysis of glycoproteins.Former experimental works did show that neuraminidase is an
exocellular enzyme, very important because it can modify the
proteins and hydrolize, more particularly, the residua of sialic
acid, localized in the terminal positions of glycolipids, in
particular of glycosphingolipid GDia.Neuraminidase is widely distributed throughout viruses and
microorganisms. This enzyme, in fact, is contained in all viruses of
the mixovirus group and in the bacteria like Arthrobacter
sialaphilus, Vibrio choleral, Clostridium welchii (perfringens),
Pseudomonas fluorescens, Ps. stuzeri, Ps. pyocyaneus, Lactobacillus
bifidus, Pneumococcus and Diphteroid bacilli and Klebsiella
aerogenes.The preparation of neuraminidase starting from said viruses and
bacteria requires, however, complex media and complex operative
conditions, leading to a poor enzyme output.The Applicant found an improved process allowing an industrial
preparation of neuraminidase; such process comprises the use of a 
bacterial strain having a rapid aerobian growth in a cheap medium,
thus obtaining a high yield, without any appreciable presence either
of toxins or of proteolytic enzymes.Said process is employing, as the bacterial strain, the Arthrobacter
Sp, obtained from the modification of the Arthrobacter Urefaciens
ATCC 7562, and is characterized in that:
a) the bacterial culture of the Arthrobacter Sp is exposed to low
concentrations of N-acetylneuraminic acid (NANA) in media containing
casein hydrolysate;b) the bacterial growth is made to occur in a continuous culture
under chemostasis conditions;c) the thus obtained enzyme is recovered from the media and purified
by means of a filtration followed by concentration, ultrafiltration,
dialysis, and flow through an ion exchanging resin.The features and the advantages of the process for the preparation
of neuraminidase, employing as the bacterial strain the Arthrobacter
Sp according to the present invention, will be more widely
illustrated during the following detailed description.The original microorganism, used during the tests, was the
Arthrobacter Urefaciens ATCC 7562, purchased from the American Type
Culture Collection.This microorganism was then modified by growth in a solid medium,
consisting of casein hydrolysate (0,1%), N-acetyl-neuraminic acid
(NANA) and agar. The
</DESCRIPTION>
<CLAIMS>
A process for preparing neuraminidase, comprising the following
steps:


a) growing Arthrobacter Ureafaciens ATCC 7562 in a solid medium
containing 0.1% of casein hydrolyzate, N-acetyl-neuraminic acid and

agar, and performing several passages, thus obtaining an axenic
consisting of a small glossy brilliant colony, defined as Arthrobacter

Sp;
b) the above obtained Arthrobacter Sp is grown under stirring-aeration
conditions, at pH 7.3 and a temperature of 26°C, in a liquid medium

containing NANA, in a concentration comprised between 0.1 and 1%, and
casein hydrolyzate;
c) once the steady state conditions are reached, the culture of
Arthrobacter Sp above obtained is fed under chemostasis conditions

with a medium, which flow rate is substantially equal to 1.8 l/h,
containing NANA and free from casein hydrolyzate, thus obtaining the

production of a considerable amount of neuraminidase;
d) recovering the thus obtained enzyme from the media and purifying it
by means of filtration followed by concentration, ultrafiltration,

dialysis, and flow through an ion exchange resin.
The process as claimed in claim 1, wherein in step b) the
Arthrobacter Sp has an initial optical density of the cellular

suspension of 0.1-0.2 OD units.
The process as claimed in claim 1, wherein the steady state
conditions are reached when the optical density of the cells is

comprised between 3 and 4 OD units.
The process as claimed in claim 1, wherein the filtration is 
carried out on a membrane of cellulose acetate having a pore diameter

of 0.2 µm; the concentration is effected through a cellulose acetate
membrane showing a molecular cut-off of 10,000 daltons; the dialysis

is effected against a pH 5.3 acetate buffer of 0.02 M; and the ion
exchange resin is a carboxymethyl dextran cross-linked with

epichlorohydrin, with an exclusion molecular weight limit of 2x10
5
,
balanced to pH 5.3 by means of the above mentioned sodium acetate

buffer.
