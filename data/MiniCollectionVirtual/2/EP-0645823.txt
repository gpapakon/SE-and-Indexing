<ABSTRACT>
An overvoltage protection device having multiple 
shorting dots (66) in the emitter region and multiple buried 

regions (72) substantially aligned with these shorting dots. 
The placement, number, and area of these buried regions 

reduce and more accurately set the overshoot voltage value 
of the device while maintaining the high surge capacities 

of the device. Further, doping types and concentrations 
have been modified from that known in the prior art to 

reduce overshoot providing a more accurate and sensitive 
overvoltage protection device than that known previously 

in the prior art. 
The emitter regions (68) are preferably p⁺⁺ doped, the 
upper base (70) is n⁺ doped, 

the mid-region layer (74) is p-doped, with the burred 
regions (72) being p⁺ doped, the lower base region (76) is 

n⁺ doped and contains a "getter" region (78) of higher doping to 
reduce the leakage current.

<DESCRIPTION>
High voltage transients, often called voltage surges,
may occur on transmission lines due to lightning strikes,
power line switching or other unanticipated events. These
voltage surges may cause damage to expensive communication
equipment connected to the transmission lines, such as
telephones, facsimile machines, or modems.Overvoltage protection devices have been developed to
protect expensive communication equipment from these
voltage surges. Such overvoltage protection devices will
protect this equipment by diverting the voltage surges
away from the transmission line before it has an
opportunity to damage the communication equipment.
Typically, overvoltage protectors remain in a
substantially non-conducting state until a voltage surge
occurs on the transmission line. When a voltage surge
occurs on the transmission line, the overvoltage
protectors will activate into a conducting state thereby
diverting the voltage surge away from the transmission
line and the telephone equipment.Conventional overvoltage protection devices include
zener diodes, gas discharge tubes and metal oxide
varistors ("MOVs"). Zener diodes operate using a voltage
breakover point, but they are not suitable for transient
suppression because of DC power dissipation and relatively
low thermal capacitance. MOVs and gas discharge tubes may
not have adequate response capabilities to provide
effective protection for fast rising voltage surges. MOVs
degrade with operation and gas discharge tubes degrade
over time. Such degradations ultimately lead to a loss of
protection capabilities.The thyristor family of semiconductor devices solves
many of the problems associated with conventional
overvoltage devices. The thyristor family of 
semiconductor devices consists of several very useful
devices, including silicon control rectifiers ("SCRs"),
triacs and sidacs. Thyristors are characterized as having
two states, an ON state and an OFF state. In the OFF
state, the device has high impedance and low current
characteristics. In the ON state, the semiconductor
device has low resistance and high current
characteristics. Some thyristors activate into an ON
state by the application of a gating current on the
device. Other thyristors automatically activate into an
ON state without gating if a large overvoltage surge is
placed across the terminals of the device. The thyristor,
like conventional overvoltage protectors, is normally in
an OFF state allowing only a small leakage current to pass
through the device. The thyristor is connected to
transmission
