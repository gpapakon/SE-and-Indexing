<ABSTRACT>
A fluid piping system is provided including a stepped conduit (14) having a transition portion (18) formed to define either a concaved or convexed outer surface relative to the axis (22), wherein the transition portion (18) inhibits rupturing while forces are directed upon the connection. In one embodiment, the concaved outer surface is so dimensioned as to fold over and reduce tearing while allowing the piping section to become non-concentric with the axis without rupturing.

<DESCRIPTION>
 RUPTURE INHIBITING FLUID TRANSITIONBACKGROUND AND SUMMARY OF THE INVENTIONThis invention relates to fluid piping and connector systems, and more particularly, to a fluid transition in such connector systems which inhibits rupture and does not "break" as a result of a sudden severe bending load applied to the connector system. A fluid transition, between cylindrical portions of different cross-section, can comprise a frusto-conical section or a "squared" section. Unfortunately, these sections can adversely effect pressure and not provide material to absorb bending moments. To accommodate for changes in pressure in the connector system, often the diameter of the conduit being connected is tapered or otherwise gradually reduced from a larger diameter to a smaller diameter.Many fluid piping and connector systems can be subjected to a complex combination of axial tensile forces and bending moments such that damage to portions of the fluid system may occur. The highest bending forces occur at system transitions, such as where interconnections are made (e.g., 'Tees" or elbows), or where connectors involve a rapid change in diameter, or where a rigid pipe changes to a flexible hose. The fluid connection system of an automobile involved in a car accident must not be ruptured.Accordingly, an object of this invention is provision of a low cost method of preventing rupture of a fluid system as a result of sudden severe bending.The invention is particularly applicable to certain fittings, or transitions, that involve a change in diameter from one section to another section.In accordance with this invention a "no break" fluid connector comprises a thin walled fitting of a flexible material formed to include either a concave in or a concave out transition portion between first and second longitudinally spaced cylindrical portions. The concave out transition is adapted to controllably fold over during a sudden bending moment, such as by an impact force perpendicular to the fitting axis, and augment the flexibility of the material. The portion of the transition material occurring furthest away from the center of the bend radius is placed in tension and provides material to facilitate extension, whereas the portion of the transition material occurring most proximate to the center of the bend radius is placed in compression and provides material to facilitate controlled folding, which allows for a no tear bending. The no tear bending is possible because the maximum stress subjected upon the system occurs during the

 CLAIMS
1. A fluid conduit for passing fluid, said conduit including longitudinally spaced first, second and third portions arranged coaxially and characterized in that said second portion includes upper and lower portions and connects said first portion to said third portion, said first portion being greater in diameter than said third portion and said second portion being adapted to collapsibly yield upon a sudden severe bending moment applied to said first and third portions, wherein the portion located furthest from the center of the radius of bend of the transition portion provides material to facilitate tension forces to extend the transition material and the portion located most proximate to the center of the radius of bend of the transition providing material to facilitate compression forces to cause the transition material to fold upon itself.
2. The conduit as claimed in Claim 1, wherein the second portion forms an inwardly concaved transition portion.
3. The conduit as claimed in Claim 1, wherein the second portion forms an outwardly concaved transition portion relative to the axis of the transition.
4. The conduit as claimed in Claim 1, wherein each of the portions are thin walled and of substantially the same thickness.
5. The conduit as claimed in Claim 4, wherein the wall of transition portion is thinner than the rest of the conduit.
6. The conduit as claimed in Claim 1, wherein said material is a ductile metal.
7. The invention as claimed in Claim 1, wherein said material is formed of a polymer. 


 8. A fluid conduit having a transition section which includes excess material located between a first portion and a second portion, the transition section being adapted to inhibit material rupture due to a bending moment in a vertical plane through the conduit axis, said excess material allows the transition section to gradually yield in a vertical plane through the conduit axis, wherein the excess material above the axis extends longitudinally and material below the axis compresses longitudinally and folds over, thereby allowing the cross-section of the conduit to yield without the material tearing and allowing the fluid flow to continue. 

9. A method of forming a fluid conduit resistant to bending moments, comprising the steps of:
(a) providing a tubular starting material;
(b) expanding a longitudinal portion of said tubular starting material by roll swaging the starting material; and
(c) shaping the elongated portion of said tubular starting material such that the exterior surface thereof forms a generally spherical section that is concaved inwardly relative to the conduits axis.
10. The method as claimed in Claim 10, wherein said tubular starting material is comprised of a polymer. 

11. A method of forming a fluid conduit resistant to bending moments, comprising the steps of:
(a) providing a tubular starting material;
(b) reducing a longitudinal portion of said tubular starting material by cold forming the starting material; and
(c) shaping the reduced portion of said tubular starting material such that the exterior surface thereof forms a generally spherical section that is convexed outwardly relative to the conduit's axis.
12. The method as claimed in Claim 11, wherein said tubular starting material is comprised of a polymer.
