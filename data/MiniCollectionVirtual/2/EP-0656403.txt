A pigment composition comprising

A) 1,4-diketopyrrolo[3,4-c]pyrrole pigment of formula



wherein A and B are each independently of the other a group
of formula



in which R
1
 and R
2
 are each independently of the other
hydrogen, halogen or CN,

and
B) 0.1-20% by weight, based on the diketopyrrolopyrrole of
formula I, of an acrylic resin obtainable by

homopolymerisation of a monomer of formula

3
 is hydrogen or methyl and R
4
 and R
5
 are each
independently of the other h
ydrogen, methyl or ethyl and
n is an integer from 1 to 6, or by copolymerisation of

the same monomer with a monomer which is copolymerisable
with said same monomer.
A pigment composition according to claim 1, wherein A
and B are identical in the 1,4-diketopyrrolo[3,4-c]
pyrrole
pigment of formula I.
A pigment composition according to claim 2, wherein A
and B are a group of formula



in which R
1
 is hydrogen, chloro or phenyl.
A pigment composition according to claim 1, which
contains an acrylic resin (B), which is obtained by

homopolymerisation of a monomer of formula II in which R
3
, R
4

and R
5
 are methyl and n is 1 or 2 in an amount of 4-10% by
weight, based on the diketopyrrolopyrrole of formula I.
Organic material of high molecular mass comprising as
colourant a pigment composition according to claim 1.
Organic material of high molecular mass according to
claim 5, which is a paint or a printing ink.
