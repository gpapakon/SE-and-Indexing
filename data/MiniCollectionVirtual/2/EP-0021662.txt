<ABSTRACT>
A multi-layer absorbent pad (20) for use in disposable 
absorbent articles, such as diapers (10) and the like, to absorb 

body fluids is characterized by having superior fluid transfer 
from a top uncompressed receiving layer (21) to a bottom 

compressed layer (22) and wicking and spreading action of 
the body fluids within the bottom layer (22) to provide a drier 

top surface to the absorbent pad. The top layer (21) is formed 
of fiberized cellulosic fibers including a cationic debonding 

agent provided therein prior to fiberization for obtaining more 
complete fiberization of the fibers and greater height and loft 

to the layer while producing resistance to normally-occurring 
hydrogen bonds between the fibers in the layer to resist compression 

of the layer and maintain the height and loft of the 
absorbent pad. The bottom layer (22) is formed of fiberized 

cellulosic fibers without a cationic debonding agent therein 
for allowing compression of the layer by effecting the 

normally-occurring hydrogen bonds between the fibers in the 
compressed layer (22) to provide a more densified layer for 

improved fluid wicking and spreading action.
