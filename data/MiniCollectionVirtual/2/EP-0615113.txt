<ABSTRACT>
Gravimetric dosing device (10) for free-flowing material, having a rotor rotating about a vertical axis, a feeding station for supplying material to the rotor, an emptying station offset with respect to the feeding station and at least one force measuring device (20), with which the mass of the material supplied respectively from the rotor via a measuring path situated between the feeding station and the emptying station is determined, the rotor (19) being subdivided into at least two mutually independent, slightly vertically mobile, equally large sectors (18), and the force measuring device (20) being arranged respectively underneath the sectors (18) at the point of its decoupling (28) from the neighbouring sector.

A gravimetric dosing device (10) for bulk materials,
including a rotor (19) rotating about a vertical shaft

(15), a charging station (B) for feeding material to said
rotor, a 
discharging station (E) being offset opposite to
said charging station (B), and at least one force measuring

device (20) by means of which there is determined the mass
of material respectively fed by said rotor via a measuring

section (M) provided between said charging station (B) and
said discharging station (E), wherein said rotor (19), by

means of flexible, preferably radially extending decoupling
stations (28) is subdivided in at least two sections (18),

preferably of equal size and adapted to be vertically
movable independently from each other at least to a small

extent, and the force measuring device (20) is respectively
arranged below said sections (18),

characterized in that

the force measuring device (20) is arranged to bridge the
respective decoupling station (28) between neighbouring

sections (18).
A gravimetric dosing device (10) for bulk materials,
including a rotor (19) rotating about a vertical shaft

(15), a charging station (B) for feeding material to said
rotor, a discharging station (E) being offset opposite to

said charging station (B), and at least one force measuring
device (20) by means of which there is determined the mass

of material respectively fed by said rotor via a measuring
section (M) provided between said charging station (B) and

said discharging station (E), wherein said rotor (19), by
means of flexible, preferably radially extending decoupling

stations (28) is subdivided in at least two sections (18),
preferably of equal size and adapted to be vertically

movable independently from each other at least to a small
extent, and the force measuring device (20) is respectively

arranged below said sections (18), characterized in that 
the force measuring device (20) is arranged symmetrically

with respect to the decoupling station (28) and is
connected to the opposing fringe areas of two neighbouring

sections (18) via a pair of levers (80).
The device of claim 1 or 2, characterized in that there are
provided at least four sections (18) and that a tare or

section deadweight measuring section (T) is located between
said discharging station (E) and said charging station (B),

the tare measurement of said section (T) being fed to an
evaluation circuit (230) to determine the net mass of the

conveyed material (22).
The device of claim 1, 2, or 3, characterized in that a
stripper (26) or a suction means and, if desired, further

discharging means (44, 46; 60, 68) are provided above said
rotor (19) at said discharging station (E).
The device of any of the preceding claims, characterized in
that the rotor (19) comprises a rotary disk (16) driven by

a motor (12) via the shaft (15) and supporting each of said
sections (18) via said force measuring devices (20).
The device of any of the preceding claims, characterized in
that the sections (18) each are supported via a guide

assembly (78).
The device of any of the preceding claims, characterized in
that the sections (18) are covered by a rubber mat (100).
The device of any of the preceding claims, characterized in
that the decoupling station (28) is formed by a radially

extending slot and is covered by a resilient cover (100).
The device of any of the preceding claims, characterized in
that both the decoupling station (28) and the resilient

cover (100) are formed by a flexible recess in the section
plate (18). 
The device of any of the preceding claims, characterized in
that an intermediate bridge (90) each is interposed between

the decoupling stations (28) covered by a resilient cover
(100), said bridge (90) being connected at its top side

with said resilient cover (100).
