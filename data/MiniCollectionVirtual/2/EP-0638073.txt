<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to novel 1-piperazino-1,2-dihydroindene derivatives
and acid addition salts thereof with activity at dopamine receptors in the central
nervous system, in particular potent antagonistic action on dopamine D1 (DA D1)
receptors, to medicaments comprising such derivatives as active ingredients, and
to the use of such derivatives in the treatment of diseases in the central nervous
system.The novel 1-piperazino-1,2-dihydroindene derivatives of the invention are trans
isomers (with respect to the indane ring system) represented by the following
formula I:

wherein
X is hydrogen, halogen, trifluoromethyl or C1-4 alkyl;Y is hydrogen or halogen;Ar is a phenyl group or a phenyl group substituted with halogen, or Ar is a thienyl
group;R1 is hydrogen, C1-4 alkyl or C1-4 alkyl substituted with hydroxy; R2 is C1-4 alkyl; orR1 and R2 together with the nitrogen and carbon atoms, respectively, to which they
are attached form a piperidino ring fused with the piperazine ring, which piperidino
ring may optionally be substituted with hydroxy;R3 is hydrogen or C1-4 alkyl; orR2 and R3 together with the carbon atom to which they are attached form a 3 to 7
membered spirocycloalkyl ring;provided that R2 and R3 may not form a ring when R1 and R2 together form a ring.The term C1-4 alkyl is intended to mean a straight or branched alkyl group, such as
methyl, ethyl, n-propyl, iso-propyl, n-butyl, sec-butyl, ect.Related 1-piperazino-3-phenylindans being unsubstituted on the piperazine ring
carbon atoms and showing potential neuroleptic activity have previously been
described in US patent No. 4,443,448. Neuroleptic activity was measured as the
ability of the compounds to block stereotypies induced by methylphenidate or
amphetamine and as the ability to induce catalepsy. Though today regarded as
indicating side-effects, cataleppsy nevertheless indicate dopaminergic activity.
Some of the compounds were also found to show effect as dopamine uptake
inhibitors. Later, DA D2 receptor binding data for some of these compounds were
reported (K.P.Bøgesø, J.Med.Chem. 1983, 26, 935-947) showing a high affinity
for D2 receptors. Furthermore, DA D1 receptor affinity, measured as inhibition of
3H-piflutixol binding, of one compound from this series, i.e. tefludazine, has been
reported to be substantially lower than the D2 affinity measured as the inhibition of
3H-spiperone binding (O. Svensen et al, Drug. Dev. Res. 1986, 7, 35-47).Other 1-piperazino-3-phenylindans are disclosed in US patent No. 4,684,650.
