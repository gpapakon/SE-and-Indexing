<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a method for fabricating an electroconducting plate (1) provided with a protection device comprising at least one of the protection elements which are a batten and an insert, said method being characterized in that the fabrication and the fixing of both the batten and the insert are achieved in a single operation and regardless of the specificity of the insulating material used for the protection elements of each type; to this effect, a thermoplastic material specific to the corresponding protection element is injected in each half-shell (11, 12) while controlling for each injection point at least the injection speed, the pressure and the temperature of the injected material.

A process for manufacturing an electrically conductive plate having a protection device,
which protection device consists of at least one of the protection elements (4, 5) which

are, on the one hand, a protection element, hereinafter referred to as a batten, which is
composed of an electrically insulating material, is optionally divided into several sections

covering at least the lateral narrow edges of the plate and prevents material from being
deposited on the narrow edges and thereby prevents the linkage through a material bridge

of the layers of material deposited on the two sides and, on the other hand, at least one
protection element (5), hereinafter referred to as an insert, which is composed of an

insulating material and is housed in the thickness of the plate, in a pre-determined region
of this plate which is generally located in the upper part of this plate and will be partially

covered by the layer of material so as to enable commencement here of detachment of the
said layer of material by a tool which is generally wedge-shaped,

in which process:

for each protection element one determines a region (8, 9, 10) which will be covered
with the corresponding protection element when the latter is fastened to the plate, these

regions being referred to as lateral (8, 9) in the case of the battens and upper (10) in the
case of the insert,
at least one hole passing through the conductive plate is made in each of the regions
thus determined and,
each protection element (4, 5) is fastened to the conductive plate (1) in such a way that
the parts of the protection element abutting on the sides of the plate are connected to one

another by members (4a, 5a) fitting into the above-mentioned holes, and
in which process:
for a conductive plate of given dimensions and form, two main half-moulds (11, 12) are
made, these each at least indirectly comprising means for positioning the plate as well as

comprising at least one female mould (13, 14) located at least at a predetermined site to
correspond on the plate to the regions which will be covered by the protection element

and,
the said protection element is moulded on the plate, and for that purpose:

the two half-moulds (11, 12) are moved apart,
the conductive plate (1) is positioned between the half-moulds,
the half-moulds are closed and 
a thermoplastic material is injected,
the thermoplastic material is at least partially cooled,
the half-moulds are then moved apart and,
the plate is removed,

this process being characterised in that:

manufacture and securing of both the battens and the insert are carried out in a
single operation whatever the specificity of the insulating material used for the protection

elements of each type, and for that purpose,
a thermoplastic material specific to the corresponding protection element is injected into
each female mould with at least the injection speed, the pressure and the temperature of

the injected material being controlled at each injection point.
A process in accordance with Claim 1, characterised in that the closing pressure is
adapted for each group of female moulds.
A process in accordance with Claim 1, characterised in that in the case of the insert,
countersinking is carried out on each of the sides of the plate, over the entire section

occupied by the insert and over a depth so determined as to keep a web which is
sufficiently thick to ensure sufficient resistance to the stresses exerted by a wedge-shaped

tool, and the said web has a plurality of through holes (17a, 17b) made therein, the sizes
and spatial arrangement of these holes (17a, 17b) being so determined as to tend towards

equal distribution of the material over the entire surface of the insert and as to ensure
perfect interlocking with the plate.
A process in accordance with Claim 1, characterised in that the material intended to
produce the insert is injected at low speed and under low pressure so as to prevent, on the

one hand, deformation of the web and, on the other hand, the appearance of peripheral
flashes.
A process in accordance with Claim 4, characterised in that the material intended for the
insert is injected at the centre of the corresponding female mould and, in order to tend

towards equal distribution of the material over the entire surface of the insert, the holes
drilled in the web are distributed so as to decrease in size towards the exterior.
Means for implementing the process in accordance with Claim 1, comprising a
conductive plate (1) provided, on the one hand, with a U-shaped protection element (4),

called a batten (4), which is located on at least two of its narrow edges (3) and whose
legs (4b, 4c) cover the said narrow edges and, on the other hand, with another protection 

element (5), called an insert, which is located in a predetermined region and is in two
parts which are each housed in a portion of the thickness of the plate in such a way that

the visible sides (6) of this insert (5) are coplanar with the two sides (7) of the plate,
these means being characterised in that they moreover comprise:


two half-moulds (11, 12) each comprising means for positioning the plate and as many

female moulds (13, 14) as protection elements (4, 5) to be produced,
means (19) for controlling the closing pressure of each group of female moulds.
An electrically conductive plate provided, on the one hand, with a U-shaped protection
element (4), called a batten (4), which is located on at least two of its narrow edges (3)

and whose legs (4b, 4c) cover the said narrow edges and, on the other hand, with another
protection element (5), called an insert, which is located in a predetermined zone and is

in two parts which are each housed in a portion of the thickness of the plate in such a
way that the visible sides (6) of this insert (5) are coplanar with the two sides (7) of the

plate, characterised in that the plate is obtained through the process in accordance with
Claim 1.
An electrically conductive plate in accordance with Claim 7, characterised in that in the
case of the insert, a predetermined region of the plate is provided with two countersinks

(15) which each house a portion of the insert and whose depth retains a web (16) of
sufficient thickness to ensure mechanical rigidity to the mechanical stresses

conventionally exerted by a wedge-shaped tool.
An electrically conductive plate in accordance with Claim 8, characterised in that as
regards the insert, the web has a central hole (17a) passing through it and has a plurality

of other holes (17b) which, distributed over the entire section, decrease in size towards
the exterior.
