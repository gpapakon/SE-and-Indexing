<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a novel process for 
the preparation of ribonucleotide reductase inhibitors. 
The target compounds of the novel process described in this 
application are disclosed by McCarthy et al. in European 
Patent Application Publication No. 0 372 268 published 
June 13, 1990 which related to certain novel 2'-halomethylidene, 
2'-ethenylidene and 2'-ethynyl cytidine, 
uridine and guanosine derivatives and compositions thereof, 
which are useful in the treatment of patients afflicted 
with neoplastic or viral disease states. The previous 
synthesis of these compounds involved a seven step reaction 
sequence in which a uridine derivative was the required 
starting material. The uridine derivative was converted to 
the known ketone intermediate of structure (A) 
  
 
wherein V is oxy or methylene and Y is hydrogen, C1-C4 alkyl 
or C1-C4 alkoxy, following generally the procedure of 
Matsuda et al. [Chem. Pharm. Bull. 1988, 36(3), 945] in a 
four step process that was labor intensive and involved 
multiple chromatographies. This intermediate was then 
subjected to olefination at the 2'-carbonyl to produce the 
exocyclic fluorovinyl sulfone followed by stannylation to 
provide the exocylic (fluorovinyl) stannane. In the final 
step this compound was destannylated and the 3',5'-hydroxyls 
were deprotected to provide the desired 
ribonucleotide reductase inhibitor in low yield. The novel process of the present invention utilizes a 
cytidine derivative as the required starting material and 
provides the ribonucleotide reductase inhibitor in a more 
efficient five step reaction sequence. The process is more 
efficient than the process of McCarthy et al. in that it 
requires fewer chromatographies and results in an overall 
yield of greater than 25% for the five steps.  
 The present invention provides a novel process for 
preparing a compound of the formula 
 
wherein 
Vis oxy or methylene and Ais a radical of the formula 
 
wherein Y is hydrogen, C1-C4 alkyl or C1-C4 alkoxy comprising 
the steps of:  
 
(a) reacting a compound of the formula 
 
wherein AB is a radical of the formula 
 
and B is a suitable nitrogen blocking group of the formula 
CR1NR2R3 wherein R1 is a hydrogen or C1-C4 alkyl and R2 and R3 
are independently C1-C4 alkyl, with a suitable phosphonate 
ylid of the formula (X)2OP=CF(SO2Ar) wherein Ar is an aryl 
group and X is a phenoxy or C1-C4 alkoxy to produce an 
exocyclic fluorovinyl sulfone; (b) reacting the exocyclic fluorovinyl sulfone with a 
suitable base or suitable
