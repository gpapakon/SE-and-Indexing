<ABSTRACT>
Stoichiometric and catalytic chemical transformations may be 
carried out in solution using novel fluorous multiphase systems (FMS). 

"Fluorous" denotes a carbon-fluorine bond rich organic molecule 
derived by replacing hydrogen atoms bonded to carbon atoms with 

fluorine. The FMS consists of a fluorous phase containing a fluorous 
solvent, typically a fluorocarbon or a fluorohydrocarbon (with or 

without substituent groups), and a reagent or a catalyst containing a 
sufficient number of fluorous moieties to render it preferentially 

soluble in the fluorous solvent and located at the interface of the 
fluorous and nonfluorous phases. The nonfluorous (i.e. the second) 

solvent, may be any known organic or nonorganic solvent(s) with 
limited or no solubility in the fluorous solvent that is effective for 

dissolving the reactants and/or separating the reaction products 
(e.g., a nonfluorous solvent having a Hildebrand solubility parameter 

of at least about 18.0 MPa
½
). The reaction can occur simultaneously in 
the fluorous phase and at the interface of the phases. The FMS 

reagents and FMS catalysts contain sufficient number of fluorous 
moieties to render them preferentially soluble into the fluorous phase 

and at the interface without impairing the efficacy or participation 
of the catalyst or reagent in the reaction which is maintained in a 

liquid or fluid phase. The preferred fluorous moieties are linear, 
branched and carbocyclic fluorocarbon alkyl chains with high carbon 

numbers that enable the catalyst or reagent to remain fluorous-phase 
compatible. The fluorous moieties may also contain O, S, N, P, As and 

Si, that assist in rendering the catalysts and reagents fluorous phase 
compatible. The FMS reagents and catalysts can be prepared by (1) 

fluorination (i.e., replacement of C-H bonds with fluorine); (2) 
fluorofunctionalization, e.g., the attachment of fluorous moieties to 

the reagents or catalysts; or (3) by total synthesis.  
The fluorous multiphase systems have utility to facilitate the 
separation of the FMS catalyst or spent FMS reagent, which has utility 

in the design and synthesis of catalysts and reagents with high 
product selectivity, resulting in especially environmentally friendly 

processes.
