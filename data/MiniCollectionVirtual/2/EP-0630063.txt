<ABSTRACT>
A bi-polar electrode for a Pb-acid battery 
comprises a lead septum plate (2) and a porous coating 

(16) on at least one face (18) of the septum plate (2) 
for anchoring at least a positive active material 

paste (24) to the septum plate (2). The porous 
coating (16) comprises multiple layers of lead 

particles (20) fused together and to the septum face 
(18) so as to define a plurality of interconnected, 

interstitial pores (22) therebetween. The particles 
(20) are fused droplets of lead arc-sprayed into the 

surface of the septum plate (2). A particular 
bi-polar battery construction useful with the bi-polar 

electrode is also disclosed.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a bipolar 
lead-acid storage battery, and more particularly to an 
electrode therefor as specified in the preamble of 
claim 1, and a method of making same. Bipolar batteries employ either one of two 
types of bipolar electrodes. The first, termed a 
"face-to-face" type of bipolar electrode, utilises an 
electrolyte-impervious, substantially planar, 
conductive septum having a first polarity active 
material on one face thereof and an opposite polarity 
active material on the opposite face thereof. Bipolar 
electrodes are typically held in frames of 
non-conductive material which isolate one cell from 
the next and which are stacked together (i.e., to form 
the battery) such that opposite polarity faces of 
adjacent electrodes oppose each other across an 
electrolyte-filled gap containing an 
electrolyte-permeable, dendrite-suppressing separator 
(eg, microporous polyethylene, glass mat or 
microporous PVC). One such battery is exemplified by 
US-A-3,728,158 (Poe et al). It is known for the electrolyte-impervious, 
conductive septum that separates the opposite polarity 
active materials, and one cell from the next, to 
comprise (1) a thin plate of lead or an alloy thereof 
(hereinafter referred to simply as lead), (2) an 
electrically-conductive polymer, or (3) a 
non-conductive polymer having a plurality of 
rivet-like conductors embedded therein for 
electrically communicating one face of the septum to 
the other. The electrically-conductive polymers (eg, 
metal-filled synthetic plastics materials) tend to 
have poorer electrical conductivity than the lead 
plates, and the embedded conductor-type septums are  
 
costly to produce and susceptible to leakage of 
electrolyte between cells due to poor sealing around 
the rivets. Accordingly, the use of solid lead plates 
is preferred for long-lived, high-power bipolar 
batteries. One of the disadvantages of the use of 
lead plate septums, however, is poor adhesion of the 
active material (e.g., paste), and particularly the 
positive active material paste, to the lead plate. 
This problem becomes aggravated with charge/discharge 
recycling of the battery and results in a shortening 
of the useful life of the battery. A bi-polar electrode for a lead-acid storage 
battery according to the present invention is 
characterised by the features specified in the 
characterising portion of claim 1. It is an object of the present invention to 
provide a unique bipolar battery electrode, and 
related battery, having a lead plate septum
