<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to audio data processing apparatus
connectable to a telephone network and methods of operating such
apparatus.In today's business environment the telephone is often the primary
means of communication in many different situations: for example placing
catalogue orders, checking airline schedules, querying prices, reviewing
account balances, and recording and retrieving messages. Conventionally,
each telephone call involves a service representative talking to a
caller, asking questions, entering responses into a computer and reading
information to a caller from a computer screen.It is known to automate this process by substituting audio data
processing apparatus for the operator. Such apparatus answers the
incoming call, receives information from, and provides information to,
the caller. This has the advantages of reducing costs, providing better
customer service, increasing the services available and extending the
hours of operation.The document US-A-4 375 083 relates to a system permitting to record a voice message and
insert so-called pointers in order to facilitate editing functions on playback/readout.However, in many current audio data processing systems the human-machine
interaction is lengthy and cumbersome due to the fact that the
voice messages delivered by the apparatus generally have to be delivered
in sequence and contain multiple choice menus that have to be announced
before each required user selection.One way of shortening the human-machine interaction is to allow
non-coded audio information to be entered which is subsequently
transcribed. Some current commercial systems use conventional answering
machines or similar devices to collect input in this way. Such schemes
have the disadvantages that only sequential access is offered to the
recorded signals, so, for example, there is no practical way to
prioritize the handling of incoming messages according to urgency.
Furthermore, the cost of audio transcription is very high, both in terms
of manpower if carried out manually or in terms of computer resources if
carried out using automatic speech recognition. The present invention enables audio data processing apparatus to be
provided which is connectable to a telephone network, the apparatus
comprising means to receive from the network and record an audio signal
comprising a sequence of audio segments separated by audio delimiters,
characterised by means for scanning the recorded signal to detect the
audio delimiters and generate a data structure in which a set of

<CLAIMS>
Audio data processing apparatus connectable to a telephone network
(20), the apparatus comprising means (50) to receive from the network and

record an audio signal (65) comprising a sequence of audio segments (70)
separated by audio delimiters (80), 
characterised by
 means (90) for
scanning the recorded signal (65) to detect the audio delimiters (80) and

generate a data structure (150, 160) in which a set of predefined field
identifiers are each linked to a corresponding one of the recorded audio

segments (160).
Apparatus as claimed in claim 1 wherein the data structure
comprises a set of audio records (160), each such record containing one

of the audio segments (70), and a record list (150), the record list
comprising a set of predefined field identifiers each having an

associated pointer to the corresponding one of the audio records (160).
Apparatus as claimed in claim 2 comprising means for editing the
record list whereby ones of the recorded audio segments can be

selectively processed.
Apparatus as claimed any preceding claim in which the scanning
means (90) has a programmable component, the apparatus comprising a

compiler (100) responsive to a formal description of the set of
predefined identifiers to generate program code for controlling the

programmable component to generate the data structure in accordance with
the set of predefined identifiers.
Apparatus as claimed in claim 4 wherein the audio signal receiving
and recording means has a programmable component and wherein the formal

description of the identifiers comprises structural information defining
one of more predefined paths through the set of identifiers, the compiler

(100) being responsive to the structural information to generate program
code for controlling the audio signal receiving and recording means to

prompt a caller to supply information in accordance with the predefined
paths though the set of identifiers.
Apparatus as claimed in any preceding claim wherein at least some 
of the audio delimiters (80) are DTMF tones.
Apparatus as claimed in any preceding claim wherein the audio
delimiters (80) are DTMF tones each of which identify an associated audio

segment.
Apparatus as claimed in any preceding claim wherein at least some
of the audio segments comprise DTMF tones.
Method for operating audio data processing apparatus to collect
information from a caller over a telephone network, the method comprising

the steps of receiving over the network from the caller and recording an
audio signal (65) comprising a sequence of audio segments (70) separated

by audio delimiters (80); and subsequently generating a data structure
(150, 160) by scanning the recorded signal (65) to detect the audio

delimiters (80) in which data structure a set of predefined field
identifiers are each linked to a corresponding one of the recorded audio

segments (160).
Method as claimed in claim 9 comprising transcribing selected ones
of the audio segments, the results of such transcription being used to

prioritize subsequent processing of the recorded signal (65).
