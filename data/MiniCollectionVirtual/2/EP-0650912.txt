<ABSTRACT>
A dual drive document deskew and sheet feeder. 
Paper sheets of various sizes and thicknesses are joggled 

and aligned into a stack (18) relative to one side and a 
top of the documents, for example, and the stack is 

placed in a hinged hopper (14) which is pivoted to be 
raised relative to left and right special picker rollers 

(28,30). Left and right drive rollers (66,68) located 
downstream in a feeding direction (31) from the picker 

rollers (28,30) are independently driven by left and 
right drive stepper motors (70,72). Sensors (88,92) 

which interact with the leading edge of a document are 
used to sense whether the documen
t is skewed relative to 
the feeding direction (31). A controller (40) receives 

the outputs from the sensors (88,92), and the outputs are 
used to dynamically deskew the document so that it can be 

fed into a document receiving apparatus (95) in a 
deskewed or aligned orientation. The special picker 

rollers (28,30) subject the top document being fed to 
alternating high and low friction forces which minimizes 

double feeds. Stripper rollers (100), having one way 
clutches (106) associated therewith and operating with 

the associated drive rollers (66,68), may be used to 
return a document to the hopper (14) if the document is 

too skewed to be deskewed within the parameters of the 
system.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a method and apparatus
for deskewing sheets of various sizes while picking the
sheets from the top of a stack of documents which are
placed in a face up orientation and for depositing the
sheets in a document receiving apparatus.Sheet feeders of the type to which this
invention is directed are commonly called automatic
document feeders (ADFs). There are several basic
problems associated with ADFs; they are:
1. Document skewing;2. Documents double feeding; and 3. Stack capacity of the hopper, for example, in which
the sheets are stored prior to picking the documents from
the stack.Document skewing in a sheet feeder is caused by
force couples or unbalanced forces that rotate the sheets
as they move through the feeder. In other situations,
the documents may be skewed, initially, in a stack of
documents from which the individual documents are picked.When the ADFs are used with utilization devices
which include character recognition algorithms and
compression algorithms, for example, the accuracy and
execution times of these algorithms are adversely
affected when the documents are skewed relative to a
scanner which provides digital images of the documents
being scanned.Many of the existing ADFs lack the capability
for mixing documents of different sizes and weights, for
example, or they may require constant attention by an
operator.Also, many of the existing ADFs have single
drive elements or rollers located in the center of a path
along which the documents are driven. The drive elements
pick and feed the documents from a point which is located 
in the center of the stack of documents. If all the
sheets are of the same size, the documents being picked
from the stack and being moved in a feeding direction are
generally driven along the feeding direction, provided
the drag forces working on the document are properly
balanced. When the stack contains documents of different
sizes, the single feed roller in the center of the stack
cannot control skewing of the document being fed.Some of the existing ADFs have moveable stack
guides to center the stack in the transport mechanism to
feed the documents along the feeding direction. Even
when the stack guides house sheets of a single size, some
clearance between the stack of sheets and the guides is
necessary. When such a clearance exists, some rotation
or skewing of the document may exist as it is moved in
the feeding direction.Some prior art ADFs use a pair of sensors to
detect document skew. When the skewing becomes
excessive, the output of
