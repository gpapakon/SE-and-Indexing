<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an encoding
apparatus using variable length encoding and, more
particularly, to code amount control.In recent years, commercial VTRs for encoding an
image signal with high efficiency, and
recording/reproducing the encoded image signal on/from
a recording medium such as a magnetic tape have been
proposed.As a technique for compressing and encoding an
image signal with high efficiency, an encoding
apparatus using orthogonal conversion is known. In
this apparatus, after an image is divided into blocks
(to be referred to as discrete cosine transform (DCT)
blocks hereinafter) each consisting of a predetermined
number of pixels, the DCT blocks are subjected to
orthogonal conversion such as DCT conversion, and
converted DCT coefficients are quantized to perform,
e.g., entropy encoding.As a method of high-efficiency encoding, a
variable length encoding method with a high compression
ratio tends to be used. When data is recorded on a recording medium using
variable length codes, it is desirable that a
predetermined number of DCT blocks have a constant
information amount in consideration of a special
reproduction mode, error propagation, and the like.A conventional encoding apparatus will be
described below.Fig. 1 is a block diagram of a conventional
encoding apparatus. Note that two-dimensional DCT
conversion is performed in units of small-size blocks
each consisting of 8 pixels (horizontal) × 8 pixels
(vertical) of an image signal, and the information
amount is controlled to be constant in units of
large-size blocks each consisting of 30 DCT blocks.Referring to Fig. 1, a sample value of an image
signal is input from an input terminal 1, and a
large-size block forming circuit 2 selects 30 DCT
blocks as a large-size block from 1-frame data
according to an arbitrary rule.This image signal is then supplied to a small-size
block forming circuit 3, and is divided into small-size
blocks each consisting of 8 × 8 pixels.A sample value of the image signal divided into
the small-size blocks is input to an orthogonal
conversion circuit 4, and the small-size blocks are
DCT-converted, thus outputting 64 conversion
coefficients in units of small-size blocks. The conversion coefficients are stored in a buffer
circuit 5 in units of large-size blocks, and are also
supplied to a code amount calculation circuit 7. The
code amount calculation circuit 7 calculates the code
amount of each large-size block upon encoding, and
outputs the calculation result to a quantizer selection
circuit 8.The
