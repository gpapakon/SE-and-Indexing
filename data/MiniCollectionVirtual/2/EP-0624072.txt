<ABSTRACT>
A rotating tool comprises a rotatably supported hub, around the circumference of which a number of working tip elements (4) are arranged. The hub consists of at least one essentially disc shaped, elastic, and in the axial direction elastically deflectable hub section (6), and the working tip elements (4) are located in the ends of pin-like holders (16) which are imbedded in the hub section (6).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a rotating tool, comprising
a rotatably supported hub, around the circumference of which a
number of working tip elements (4) are arranged.More particularly it is the question of a rotating tool of
the type intended for the rough-finishing of surfaces, such as
the removal of rust on steel plates, machining of welds before
application of additional weld material, grinding of concrete
surfaces, paint removal, etc.Through i.a. DE 2,652,716, FR 718,874, US 1,633,274,
US 3,958,294, US 4,183,113, and PCT/SE86/00307 rotating tools of
the kind indicated by way of introduction are known, which have
their working tip elements situated at the ends of more or less
elastic metal wires which are attached to the hub. A serious
disadvantage with these tools is, besides in many cases poor
material removal capacity and limited resistance against wear,
that the wires break so that wire pieces can be thrown off with
great force, with the accompanying risk for personal injuries.The object of the present invention is to provide a rotating
tool, which in comparison to the state of the art has a very
large material removal capacity and has its working tip elements
fastened in such a way that there exists very little risk that
pieces of metal shall be able to come loose and be thrown off in
operation.This object has been achieved for a rotating tool of the kind
defined by way of introduction, according to the invention, in
that the hub consists of at least one essentially disc shaped,
elastic, and in the axial direction elastically deflectable hub
section, and that the working tip elements are located in the
ends of pin-like holders which are imbedded in the hub section
in a way to be able to follow deflections of said disc shaped 
hub-section under load.Preferably the holders are applied in the hub section by
injection molding of the latter.According to an advantageous embodiment the holders consist
of sleeves, in the outer end of which the working tip element is
fastened, allowing for the sleeves to be applied in the hub
section by injection molding of the latter such that its
material also penetrates into the sleeves.According to a further advantageous embodiment the sleeves
has a longitudinally extending slit, which i. a. allows for the
working tip elements to be fastened in the end of the respective
sleeve by means of a solder metal piece applied in the slit.Alternatively the working tip elements may be fastened in the
end of the respective sleeves by clamping which, according to a
very
