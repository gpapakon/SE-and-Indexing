<ABSTRACT>
Current bushing for a medium-voltage cell, produced by the overmoulding of an insulating resin around a straight metal conductor (2) possessing connection regions at its ends (2A, 2B), the said bushing comprising an axial body (1) around the said conductor and a substantially cylindrical receptacle (4) moulded together with the said cylindrical body, the said receptacle including a flat bottom (4') and a cylindrical lateral skirt (4'') extending coaxially with the said body (1), the said bottom being substantially located at one (2B) of the ends for connecting the said conductor, characterised in that the said axial body (1) extends above the upper level of the skirt of the receptacle (4) over a distance substantially equal to the rated-voltage clearance of the cell.

<CLAIMS>
A current feedthrough for a medium-voltage bay, which feedthrough 
is made by over-molding an insulating resin around a rectilinear 

metal conductor (2) having connection tabs at its ends (2A, 2B), said 

feedthrough including an axial body (1) around said conductor and a 
substantially cylindrical receptacle (4) integrally molded with said 

cylindrical body, said receptacle including a flat bottom (4') and a 
cylindrical side skirt (4") extending coaxially to said body (1), 

said bottom being disposed substantially at one of the connection 
ends (2B) of said conductor, said axial body (1) extending above the 

top of the skirt of the receptacle (4) over a distance substantially 
equal to the insulation distance at the nominal voltage of the bay. 
A current feedthrough according to claim 1, characterized in that 
the inside walls of said skirt (4") and the surface of said body (1) 

are covered with a conductive layer (9) up to the level of the flange 
(10). 
A current feedthrough according to claim 2, characterized in that 
the conductive layer (9) terminates around the body (1) via a field 

distributor device (8) such as a layer of semiconductive varnish. 
A current feedthrough according to any one of claims 1 to 3, 
characterized in that the volume of the receptacle (4) contains at 

least one toroidal core having a low-voltage winding (12) cooperating 
with the conductor of the feedthrough to form a medium-voltage 

current transformer, said toroidal core being protected 
against the risks of arcs striking with the live bare points by a 

metal cover (11) provided with a hole enabling it to be threaded over 
the axial body (1), said cover being grounded by being in contact 

with the inside metal-plating of the receptacle. 
A current feedthrough according to any one of claims 1 to 4, 
characterized in that it includes a support bracket (5) made of an 

insulating material united with the outside face of the skirt (4), 
said support bracket having a fixing surface enabling it to be fixed 

to a metal wall parallel to the axis of the feedthrough.  
 
A current feedthrough according to claim 5, characterized in that 
the support bracket (5) is integrally molded with the remainder of 

the feedthrough. 
A current feedthrough according to claim 5 or 6, characterized in 
that the support bracket is provided with a hole (6) opening out 

inside the receptacle and serving to pass the wires from the current-sensing 
cores. 
A current feedthrough according to any one of claims 2 to 7, 
characterized in that the metal-plating (9) of the body (2) cooperates 

with the conductor (1) to form a medium-voltage capacitance 
which, grounded via a low-voltage capacitor or via a stray 

capacitance situated outside the current feedthrough, thus forms a 
capacitive voltage divider capable of powering a protective device or 

a luminous signalling device for indicating the presence of voltage 
on the conductor of the feedthrough. 
A current feedthrough according to any one of claims 1 to 8, 
characterized in that, at least between its top end (2A) and the top 

surface of the flange, the body (1) is shaped conically so as to 
enable an insulating sleeve (18) made of a flexible material to be 

fitted over it, said sleeve having a plane bottom end (18A) provided 
with holes that can be disposed facing the holes in the flange (10), 

thereby enabling the sleeve to be fixed onto said flange so as to 
close the receptacle. 
A current feedthrough according to claim 9, characterized in that 
the sleeve (18) is fixed onto the flange (10) via an insulating ring 

(18B) providing sealing between the inside and the outside of the 
receptacle, by uniformly compressing the end (18A) of the sleeve (18) 

onto the flange (10). 
A current feedthrough according to claim 9 or 10, characterized 
in that the sleeve is provided with fins.  

 
A current feedthrough according to any one of claims 1 to 11, 
characterized in that the outside of the bottom (4') is provided with 

one or more integrally molded concentric fins (20). 
A current feedthrough according to any one of claims 1 to 12, 
characterized in that the conductor (31) is of circular section and 

is provided at its top end (31A) with an axial hole enabling it to 
receive a sliding contact (27), the top portion of the body being in 

the shape of a cone of standardized dimensions enabling it to receive 
a pluggable terminal (32) of a medium-voltage cable.
