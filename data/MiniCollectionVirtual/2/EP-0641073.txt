<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a structure by which
a resonator using an ultrathin piezoelectric plate, capable
of providing resonance frequencies as high as tens to
hundreds of megahertz, is supported in a package.In recent years there has been a strong and growing
demand for high frequency operation and high frequency
stability of various pieces of electronic and communication
equipment. An ordinary AT cut quartz crystal resonator,
which has heretofore been used widely as a piezoelectric
device (such as a resonator or filter), has a very
excellent temperature-frequency characteristic. However,
since its resonance frequency is in inverse proportion to
its thickness, the fundamental frequency of this kind of
resonator with a mechanical strength sufficient for
practical use is around 40 MHz at the highest.There has also been widely employed what is called
overtone oscillation means which extracts a higher order
harmonic mode vibration of an AT cut quartz crystal
resonator to obtain a frequency which is an odd multiple of
the fundamental resonance frequency, but its oscillation
circuit calls for an LC tuning circuit including a coil,
and hence is not suitable for fabrication as a
semiconductor IC, besides the overtone oscillation circuit
may sometimes be difficult to activate because such a
resonator has a large capacitance ratio and consequently a
high impedance level.On the other hand, a surface acoustic wave (SAW)
resonator, whose oscillation frequency is determined by the
pitch of electrodes of an interdigital transducer, has come
to be able to output a maximum of 1 GHz or so due to the
progress in photolithography, but a piezoelectric substrate
usable for the SAW resonator is remarkably inferior to the
AT cut quartz crystal in terms of temperature-frequency
characteristic. To solve the above-mentioned problems, there has been
proposed in house, but not disclosed publicly, a
piezoelectric resonator such as shown in Figs. 5(a), 5(b),
6(a) and 6(b).That is, a cavity or recess 5 is formed, by machining
or etching, in one side of a block 1 of AT cut quartz
crystal substantially centrally thereof as depicted in
Figs. 5(a) and (b) and the thickness of a vibratory portion
2 forming the bottom of the cavity 5 is selected about
16Âµm, for example, if a fundamental resonance frequency of
100 MHz is desired.On the side of the block where the cavity 5 is formed,
the ultrathin vibratory portion 2 is edged with a thick
frame-like marginal rib portion 3 formed integrally
therewith. The ultrathin vibratory portion 2

A structure of a piezoelectric resonator housed within
a package (11), the resonator having an ultrathin vibratory

portion (2) formed by a cavity (5) made in one side of
an AT cut quartz crystal block (1) substantially

centrally thereof and a thick frame-like rib (3) formed
integrally with and surrounding the vibrating portion,

wherein the resonator is fixed in the package by an
elongate adhesive coated region (15) on a marginal portion

of the frame-like rib and extending along the z-axis
direction of the crystal.
A structure according to claim 1, wherein the
resonator has an excess adhesive receiving groove or slit

(40) cut in the marginal portion of the frame-like rib
along one side of the cavity between the adhesive coated

region (15) at which the resonator is attached to the
package and the edge of the cavity for preventing the

adhesive from flowing into the cavity from the adhesive
coated region.
