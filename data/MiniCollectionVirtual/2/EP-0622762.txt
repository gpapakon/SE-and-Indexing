<ABSTRACT>
A fluorescence detection apparatus which judges the 
genuineness of an examined object on which a fluorescent 

substance is printed, such as paper money, which is 
compact, ease in terms of positioning of the optical 

system, and keeps down to a major degree the effects of 
transport vibration of the examined object. Toward this 

end, the optical system inside the fluorescence detection 
apparatus uses a single glass block (4) of an angular 

columnar shape which does not fluoresce under ultraviolet 
light and has an angular columnar shape. The glass block 

(4) is provided with an incidence face (5) through which 
the excitation light passes, a reflection and emission 

face (6) at which the excitation light including the 
ultraviolet light from the excitation light source (2) is 

reflected and through which the fluorescence emitted from 
the fluorescent substance of the examined object (1) 

passes, and a detection face (7) which faces the examined 
object (1), passes the excitation light reflected at the 

reflection and emission face (6), irradiates the examined 
object (1), and passes the fluorescence generated from the  

 
fluorescent substance of the examined object (1). The 

incidence face (5) is provided with a filtering function 
blocking the visible light component of the excitation 

light from the excitation light source (2) and passing 
only the ultraviolet light region or else the incidence 

face (5A) is not provided with this filtering function, 

but a filter (10) blocking the visible light component 
included in the excitation light and passes only the 

ultraviolet light region is disposed between the 
excitation light source (2) and the incidence face (5A).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a fluorescence
detection apparatus used for detecting fluorescence
emitted from a fluorescent substance of paper, such as
paper money printed with a fluorescent substance for
purposes of discrimination or including a fluorescent
substance for purposes of discrimination, for judging the
genuineness of the paper.Paper money, securities, and other important
documents (paper) are often forged. It is becoming
important to take steps to prevent forgery and to judge
the non-genuineness of forged paper money.For example, some of the paper money and other
paper issued and in circulation in the world is printed
with a fluorescent substance for the purposes of
discrimination or include such a fluorescent substance.
More specifically, there is paper which is printed with a
design or pattern by an ink including a fluorescent
substance and paper including a thread like fluorescent
substance (fluorescent thread) inside it and printed with 
a design or pattern by an ordinary ink.To judge the genuineness of such paper, there
has been known in the past the method of irradiating paper
containing a discrimination use fluorescent substance
(hereinafter referred to as the "examined object" with
ultraviolet light as excitation light, detecting the
fluorescence emitted from the fluorescent substance of the
examined object due to the irradiation, and judging the
pattern (discriminating) of the detected signals.Further, along with the improvement in the
performance of copying machines, paper money is now
sometimes forged by copying them. As the method for
judging the non-genuineness of such forged paper money,
there is known the method of judging paper money to have
been forged by copying if fluorescence is detected from
the examined object, since the white paper commercially
sold for copier use (copy paper) includes a fluorescent
whitener, and the paper used for paper money generally
does not include a fluorescent substance.As a basic method for detecting such a
fluorescent substance, for example, there is proposed the
method shown in Fig. 1 and Fig. 2.In Fig. 1 and Fig. 2, a black light, ultraviolet
(UV) lamp, or other excitation light source 101 has 
disposed in front of it an optical filter 102 which passes
the range of wavelength of the excitation light, but
blocks the unnecessary range, in particular the visible
light range. Excitation light is irradiated through the
optical filter 102 and a detection window 106 to the paper
or other examined object 103. The excitation light from
