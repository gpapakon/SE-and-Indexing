<ABSTRACT>
The coil includes a winding coiled over a straight-line magnetic core consisting of a plurality of ferrite cylinders (4, 5, 6) placed end to end with a space between each of them. The ferrite cylinders are all held in place in a single cylinder (3) made of moulded plastic, which, on its outer cylindrical surface, includes a helical groove (7). Applications: injection of current at low frequency into a cable of a television distribution network.

A self-inductance coil intended for injecting a low-frequency current into a
cable of a television distribution system, which coil comprises a winding arranged on a

cylinder made of a molded plastic material containing a straight magnetic core,

characterized in that
 said magnetic core is formed by a plurality of ferrite cylinders (4, 5, 6)
confined in the cylinder of a plastic material (3) and disposed in line with one another and

held in place by being molded in the plastic material of the cylinder, with a spacing
between each of them.
An self-inductance coil as claimed in Claim 1, 
characterized in that
 the
number of ferrite cylinders is three.
A self-inductance coil as claimed in Claim 1, 
characterized in that
 the
cylinder of a molded plastic material has a helical groove (7) in its outer surface.
A self-inductance coil as claimed in any one of the Claims 1 to 3,

characterized in that
, with the self-inductance coil being intended for blocking signals of a
frequency between 5 MHz and over 1 GHz while allowing the passage of 50 Hz currents of

approximately ten amperes, the core is made of three ferrite cylinders of a material called
"ferroxcube 4B1" and of a diameter of between 7 and 13 millimeters, the cylinders having a

length of between 8 and 16 millimeters and being separated from one another by spacings
of between 1 and 3 millimeters each, and the winding has a number of turns between 20

and 40, wound from a wire whose diameter is between 8 and 16 tenths of a millimeter.
