<DESCRIPTION>
The government has rights in this invention 
pursuant to Grant Nos. ISI-8722212 and ISI-8660126 
awarded by the National Science Foundation. Hydrogen-permeable membranes are known. They 
fall generally into three classes: polymeric membranes, 
inorganic (non-metal porous or nonporous) membranes, and 
dense (nonporous) metal membranes. Polymeric membranes 
suffer from limited selectivity toward hydrogen over 
other gases, and limited resistance to high temperatures 
and reactive chemicals that may be present in typical 
feed gases. Exemplary porous inorganic molecular hydrogen-permeable 
membranes such as aluminum oxide, silicon 
oxide, titanium oxide, magnesium oxide, chromium oxide, 
tin oxide, and various zeolites, have been investigated. 
See, for example, Hsieh, 33 Catal. Rev. Sci. Eng. 1 
(1991). While such membranes exhibit very high hydrogen 
permeability, they also suffer from very low hydrogen 
selectivity due to their porous nature. Nonporous 
inorganic oxides are also known to be permeable to 
hydrogen in its ionic form. For example, U.S. Patent 
No. 5,094,927 discloses materials that are permeable to 
hydrogen ions (referred to as solid-state proton 
conductors) based on silicon oxide, oxides of Groups IVB, 
VB, VIB and VIII of the Periodic Table, and fluorides of 
Groups IIA and IIIB of the Periodic Table. Additionally, 
diffusion coefficients for hydrogen ions through the 
oxides of molybdenum and tungsten have been reported by 
Sermon et al. in 72 JCS Faraday Trans. I. 730 (1976).  
 
Such solid-state proton conductors have been used by 
placing them between the cathode and anode in fuel cells, 
resulting in a net transport of hydrogen between the 
cathode and anode. However, these solid-state proton 
conductors are generally brittle and exhibit relatively 
low permeability to hydrogen, and have not generally been 
reported for use as a hydrogen separation membrane. The 
one exception is a nonporous silicon oxide membrane that 
is reported to allow hydrogen permeation through the 
silicon oxide by an activated surface-transport mechanism 
along grain boundaries. See Gavalas et al., 44 Chem.Eng. Sci. 1829 (1989). Although this dense silicon oxide 
membrane exhibits very high selectivities for hydrogen 
over nitrogen, it is also brittle and susceptible to 
reaction with steam at elevated temperatures, further 
limiting its utility. Dense (nonporous) metal membranes that are 
selectively permeable to hydrogen are also known. See, 
for example, U.S. Patent Nos. 4,388,479 and 3,393,098,
