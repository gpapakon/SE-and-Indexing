<ABSTRACT>
A method of inhibiting one or more CNS 
disorders in a post-menopausal woman comprising 

administering to a female human in need of treatment an 
effective amount of a compound having the formula 


   wherein R¹ and R³ are independently hydrogen, 
-CH₃, 


wherein Ar is 
optionally substituted phenyl;

 
   R² is selected from the group consisting of 

pyrrolidine, hexamethyleneamino, and piperidino; or a 
pharmaceutically acceptable salt of solvate thereof.

<DESCRIPTION>
In climacteric women, anxiety, depression,
tension and irritability begin during the perimenopause and
can be correlated to reduced estrogen levels and estrogen
replacement therapy has been recommended for the treatment
of these symptoms (Malleson J., Lancet, 2: 158, (1953);
Wilson et. al., J. Am. Geriatric Soc., 11: 347 (1963)).
The mechanism for protective effects of estrogen in this
case is unknown, but may be related to potential effects of
estrogen on biogenic amines such as serotonin (Aylward M.,
Int. Res. Communications System Med. Sci., 1: 30 (1973)).
To this regard circulating serotonin is reduced in post-menopausal
women (Gonzales G., et. al., Maturitas 17: 23-29
(1993)), and serotonin (as well as several other biogenic
amines) have a putative role in behavioral depression.Phillips and Sherwin (Psychoneuroendocrinology,
17: 485-495 (1992)) reported that in surgically menopausal
women given estrogen, scores in immediate and delayed
recall tests are greater than in similar women not given
estrogen. Two potential hypotheses might explain this
effect. There is some evidence that partial estrogen
agonists (or anti-estrogens) such as tamoxifen interact
with the muscarinic receptor (Ben-Baruch G., et. al.,
Molec. Pharmacol. 21: 287-293 1982), and muscarinic
agonists (M2) are known to produce positive effects in a
number of memory associated tasks and may have clinical
relevance in Alzheimer's Disease. Another interesting
possibility may be linked to neurokinins such as Substance
P, which are known to have neurotrophic as well as memory-promoting
effects (Thoenen H., Trends in Neuroscience, 14:
165-170 (1991); Huston J. et. al., Neurosci. Biobehav.
Rev. 13: 171-180 (1989)), thus, through an effect either at
a neurotransmitter receptor in the CNS or at a neuropeptide
receptor, a tissue selective estrogen agonist/antagonist 
could produce memory and cognitive enhancing effects. Such
an activity would most relevantly be assessed in man, but a
variety of animal models (i.e. maze learning, extinction
etc.) are available for preclinical testing.Perhaps the most frequent CNS related problem in
climacteric women is the occurrence of hot flushes. While
this undoubtedly is a somatic effect mediated by effects on
the microvasculature, current evidence points strongly in
the direction of CNS initiated effect (Lomax P., et. al.,
Pharmac. Ther. 57: 347-358 (1993)). Therefore, a tissue
selective estrogen agonist/antagonist like raloxifene might
offer the ideal therapy providing the desired effect in the
absence of
