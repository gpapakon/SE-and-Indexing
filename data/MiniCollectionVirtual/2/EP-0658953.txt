<ABSTRACT>
A modular jack assembly (2) for mounting to a printed 
circuit board, comprises a plurality of modular jacks (4) 

assembled to a common integral housing (6) in two rows (5,6) and 
disposed in back-to-back mirror image symmetry. Shielding 

(8), is provided around the connector assembly (2) and 
shielding between the two rows (3, 5) is also provided for 

suppressing cross-talk therebetween. The construction is 
compact, providing for a large number of ports without 

increasing the length of the assembly (2), whilst 
also providing good access to the resilient locking

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to an electrical connector 
assembly for mounting on a printed circuit board and, 
more particularly, to a multi-port modular jack connector 
assembly for mounting on a printed circuit board for high 
speed data transmission. It is quite common to use modular jacks for the 
transmission of digital data, whereby some computing 
equipment is accessed by a plurality of devices and 
therefore has a plurality of modular jacks. In order to 
reduce the cost and space requirements, these modular 
jacks have been integrated in a single housing in a 
juxtaposed manner for mounting onto a PC board as shown 
in Figure 1. Due to the high data transmission speed of 
many computers today, such multi-port modular jacks are 
also provided with shielding around the external surface 
of the integral housing. It is also an advantage to have 
a large number of modular jacks mounted to an edge of the 
same printed circuit board. However, increasing the 
number of parts would lengthen the connector assembly in 
the prior art solution shown in Figure 1, as the modular 
jacks are arranged in a single row. The connector 
assembly length, however, is limited by the external size 
of the computer and the length of the printed circuit 
board to which it is mounted. It would therefore be 
desirable to increase the number of parts without 
increasing the length of the connector. In doing so, one 
should ensure that the resilient latches of the modular 
plugs that connect with the jacks are easily accessible 
in order to easily release the plug from the jack.  
 
Certain data transmission standards, such as 10 Base T, 
require connector assemblies to function reliably for 
very high data transmission speeds and also high 
voltages. High data transmission speeds, e.g. 100 Mhz, 
require effective shielding, and high voltages mean that 
the signal contacts should be sufficiently spaced from 
the grounding circuits in order to avoid flashover. It is therefore an object of this invention to 
provide a multi-port modular jack connector assembly for 
mounting on a printed circuit board with an increased 
number of ports without increasing the length of the 
assembly. It is another object to provide a compact and 
relatively inexpensive modular jack assembly with good 
access for latching and unlatching of complementary 
modular plugs for connection therewith. The invention consists in an electrical connector 
assembly for mounting on a printed circuit board (PCB), 
comprising a plurality of receptacle connectors
