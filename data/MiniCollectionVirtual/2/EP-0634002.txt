<DESCRIPTION>
An electromagnetic flowmeter for measuring the
velocity of fluid flow in a conduit is disclosed,
wherein electromagnetic means completely external of
the conduit generate a magnetic field that extends
concentrically about the longitudinal axis of the
conduit, which field is stronger adjacent the inner
periphery of the conduit wall, and weaker adjacent the
center of the conduit. The potential between first
electrodes arranged in circumferentially spaced
relation on the inner periphery of the conduit within
the magnetic field, and longitudinally spaced second
electrode means outside the magnetic field, affords an
accurate measurement of flow velocity.Electromagnetic flowmeters are well known in the
patented prior art, as evidenced, for example, by the
prior patents to Broding No. 2,583,724, De Boisblanc
No. 2,691,303, and Handel No. 4,137,766.Coaxial type flowmeters are discussed in the book
The Theory of Electromagnetic Flow Measurement (1962)
by J.A. Shercliff. Shercliff indicates that the
coaxial electromagnetic flowmeter is the one meter
that would be totally insensitive to velocity
profiles. Shercliff discusses two ways of
implementing such a meter: (1) through the use of a
central member generating a current and thus creating 
a magnetic field that is strongest near the center of
the pipe and weakest near the pipe periphery (i.e.,
just the opposite of what is required), and (2) by the
passing of current down through the fluid itself (the
fluid would have to be a conductive metal), thereby
causing a magnetic field that is zero at the center
and stronger near the outer wall (the proper magnetic
shape for having a meter that is insensitive to
velocity profile shifts).The patents to Kasai No. 4,809,559 and Bourg No.
3,589,186 represent attempts to minimize the changing
profile effects of transverse field type flowmeters by
using wide angle electrodes and/or shaped magnetic
fields.While virtually all flowmeters of modern day
industrial applications are of the transverse field
type, there has been a small amount of work in the
areas of both axial field electromagnetic flowmeters
and radial field electromagnetic flowmeters. Examples
of radial field electromagnetic flowmeters are shown
in the aforementioned patents Nos. 2,691,303 and
2,583,724, and in "A Magnetic Flowmeter with
Concentric Electrodes" by Eastman et al,
Instrumentation Technology, June 1970, pages 52-54, an
axial field flowmeter is described.In "Principle of Electromagnetic Flowmeter
