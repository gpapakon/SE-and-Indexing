<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a catalyst for purifying 
exhaust gases and a process for purifying exhaust gases. More 
particularly, it relates to the catalyst and the process which 
can efficiently purify nitrogen oxides (NOx) in the exhaust 
gases whose oxygen concentrations are at the stoichiometric 
point or more than required for oxidizing carbon monoxide (CO) 
and hydrocarbons (HC) therein. As catalysts for purifying automotive exhaust gases, there 
have been employed 3-way catalysts so far which oxdize CO and 
HC and reduce NOx simultaneously to purify the exhaust gases. 
For example, the 3-way catalysts have been known widely which 
comprise a heat resistant support formed of cordierite, a 
catalyst carrier layer formed of gamma-alumina and disposed on 
the support, and a noble metal selected from the group 
consisting of Pt, Pd and Rh and loaded on the catalyst carrier  
 
layer. The purifying performance of the 3-way catalysts for 
purifying exhaust gases depends on the air-fuel ratio (A/F) of 
automotive engine. For instance, when the air-fuel weight 
ratio is larger than 14.6, i.e., when the fuel concentration is 
low (or on the fuel-lean side), the oxygen concentration is 
high in exhaust gases. Accordingly, the oxidation reactions 
purifying CO and HC are active, but the reduction reactions 
purifying NOx are inactive. On the other hand, when the air-fuel 
ratio is smaller than 14.6, i.e., when the fuel 
concentration is higher (or on the fuel-rich side), the oxygen 
concentration is low in exhaust gases. Accordingly, the 
oxidation reactions are inactive, but the reduction reactions 
are active. Moreover, when driving automobiles, especially when 
driving automobiles in urban areas, the automobiles are 
accelerated and decelerated frequently. Consequently, the air-fuel 
ratio varies frequently in the range of from the values 
adjacent to the stoichiometric point (or the theoretical air-fuel 
ratio: 14.6) to the fuel-rich side. In order to satisfy 
the low fuel consumption requirement during the driving 
conditions such as in the above-described urban areas, it is 
necessary to operate the automobiles on the fuel-lean side 
where the air-fuel mixture containing oxygen as excessive as  
 
possible is supplied to the engines. Hence, it has been 
desired to develop a catalyst which is capable of adequately 
purifying NOx even on the fuel-lean side (i.e., in the oxygen-rich 
atmospheres). In view of the aforementioned circumstances, the 
applicants of the present invention applied for a
