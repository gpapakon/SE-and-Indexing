<ABSTRACT>
A holding member (1) for holding a pipe (P) and a mounting
member (2) for fixing the pipe (P) to a body panel (B) are

previously connected together by a thin connecting portion
(9) to be integrated. The holding member (1) and the mounting

member (2) in the integrated state are set in a forming die.
The connecting portion (9) is collapsed with the die closing

such that the holding member (1) and the mounting member (2)
are separated from each other. A coupling member (3) is

formed in this state. Accordingly, the working efficiency
can be improved as compared with the case where the holding

member and the mounting member are individually set in the
die. The holding member (1) and the mounting member (2) are

coupled together by the coupling member (3). Since the
coupling member (3) is formed of a rubber material, vibration

caused in the pipe (P) can be prevented from being transferred
to the body side.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to pipe clamps for holding
various types of pipes.Various types of pipes are used in automobiles and resin
holders called pipe clamps are conventionally used to fix the
pipes to the automobile body side. The pipe clamps are
usually formed integrally of a resin such as polypropylene.
Pulsation of a fluid flowing through the pipe sometimes
vibrates the pipe clamp. The vibration needs to be prevented
from being transferred via the pipe clamp to the automobile
body side. In use of the pipe clamp formed integrally of the
resin as described above, however, the transfer of vibration
is difficult to be prevented.The prior art has developed a pipe clamp in which a soft
resin portion with the ability to absorb vibration is stacked
on a pipe holding portion thereof so that the pipe overlaps
the soft resin portion. However, since the pipe is held by
the soft resin, a holding force against the pipe is inevitably
reduced although the soft resin is effective for the
absorption of vibration. Consequently, the pipe deviates
from its normal state to be held in an inclined state when
the pipe clamp is subjected to an external force after having
been attached to the pipe.As a countermeasure, it is proposed to individually form
a portion holding the pipe and a portion fixing the pipe to
the body side and to connect these portions by a soft resin
portion. As a result, the vibration transferred to the body
side could be absorbed by the soft resin portion and a 
sufficient strength could be ensured in the portion holding
the pipe or fixed to the body side.However, when the pipe clamp comprises two separate
members, that is, the pipe holding portion and the pipe fixing
portion as described above, connecting the two portions by
the soft resin portion is important. An insert molding could
be one of most effective means. The pipe holding portion and
the pipe fixing portion need to be integrated previously when
these portions are set in a die. The integrating work is
troublesome. Moreover, both portions need to be integrated
through a space provided for forming the soft resin portion.
In this case, setting the two portions in the die with the
portions being positioned causes troubles, resulting in an
increase in the working time. Thus, the above-described
problem is very important in achievement of automated forming
of the pipe clamp. As an example, JP-3054971 Y2 relates to a mountable part, particularly to a
mountable connector comprised of a first element having a specified application
such as a pipe holder

<CLAIMS>
A pipe clamp comprising a holding member (1) formed of a hard resin for
holding a pipe (P) or the like and a mounting member (2) formed of the same hard

resin as the holding member (1) for mounting the pipe (P) or the like on a fixed
surface (B), 
characterized in that

the holding member (1) and the mounting member (2) are integrally connected by
a connecting portion (9), wherein a coupling member (3) formed of a soft resin

with an ability to absorb vibration is arranged in a space defined between the
holding member (1) and the mounting member (2), thereby coupling both members

(1, 2) together, and wherein the connecting portion (9) is collapsable and replaceable
by the coupling member (3).
A pipe clamp according to claim 1, 
characterized in
that
 the connecting portion (9) is formed so as to be
collapsible by a die-closing operation in the forming of the

coupling member (3).
A pipe clamp according to claim 1 or 2, 
characterized in
that
 the holding member (1) includes a portion formed with
a pipe holding groove (6) for holding the pipe (P) and the

other portion, both portions being separably connected
together and being coupled together by the coupling member

(3) formed in the space therebetween.
A pipe clamp according to claim 1 or 2, 
characterized in
that
 either the holding member (1) or the mounting member (2) 
is formed with a void (5) through which a material for the

coupling member (3) is caused to flow.
A pipe clamp according to anyone of the preceding claims,

charcterized in
that
 the holding member (1) includes a frame-shaped receiving
portion (4), and that the mounting member (2) is formed to

be loosely insertable into the receiving portion (4) of the
holding member (1) and connected to the holding member (1)

by the collapsible connecting portion (9) so as to protrude
in a die-closing direction before the forming of the coupling

member (3), the mounting member (2) being pushed by a forming

die with the die closing to thereby be moved into the receiving
portion, breaking the connecting portion (9).
A pipe clamp according to anyone of the preceding claims,
characterized in

that
 the holding member (1) includes a frame-shaped receiving
portion (4), and that the mounting member (2) is accommodated

in the receiving portion (4) so as to be connected to the
holding member (1) by the collapsible connecting portion (9),

the connecting portion (9) being collapsed directly by a
forming die during the die closing such that the mounting

member (2) is held at a predetermined position in the receiving
portion (4).
