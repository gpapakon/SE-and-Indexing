<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a graphic package and, 
more particularly, to a graphic package comprising a 
plurality of graphics which are separated from each 
other by dual function separating layers that 
simultaneously act as both release liners and 
premasks. Graphics have long been used to customize, 
personalize, decorate and protect motor vehicles. 
The graphic may be as simple as a pin stripe which 
eXends along a side of the motor vehicle in an 
aesthetically contrasting color relative to the body. 
More elaborate graphics have been used to decorate 
larger panels of a motor vehicle such as the hood as 
has been done with certain sports cars. Graphics 
have also been applied to commercial vehicles to 
convey advertising or other important information. 
In recent years, it has become fashionable to 
embellish pickup trucks with bold, vividly colored 
graphics. In addition, transparent films (with or 
without graphic designs) have been used in areas of 
high abrasion to protect the underlying surface. The construction of a conventional, presently 
known graphic package is illustrated in FIG. 1. In 
FIG. 1, a graphic package 10 comprises a polymeric 
film 12 having a graphic design 14 printed on one  
 
surface and an adhesive 16 on an opposite surface. 
Film 12 is releasably secured to a release liner 18 
and is protected by a premask 20. Graphic-bearing 
film 12 is typically applied to a motor vehicle (not 
shown separately in the drawings) by simultaneously 
removing release liner 18 and drawing a squeegee or 
rubber roller over premask 20 to adhesively bond the 
film to the motor vehicle. Once any wrinkles, 
bubbles or swells have been removed, premask 20 is 
stripped from the film. Thus, release liner 18 acts 
as a temporary support for the film until the film is 
applied to the motor vehicle. Premask 20 protects 
graphic design 14 from unintentional damage or 
marring until the film has been applied. The premask 
may also serve as a carrier and maintain the 
registration of die cut graphics. It can also be seen that for each graphic film 
12, two layers of waste material (release liner 18 
and premask 20) are generated. The release liner and 
premask are typically formed of paper or similar 
materials and thereby contribute to the continued 
reduction of an already diminishing natural resource. 
(Plastic release liners and premasks are also known.) 
Furthermore, the considerable volume of waste 
material increases the cost of the graphic and 
clutters the workplace, necessitating constant 
effor

A graphic package comprising: 

(a) a plurality of graphics including at least a 
first graphic and a second graphic (34,36), and 
(b) a dual function separating layer (42) intermediate 
said first and second graphics (34,36), said 

separating layer (42) comprising a substrate (42a) having 
upper and lower surfaces, a release coating (42b) on said 

upper surface for releasably retaining said first graphic 
on said substrate, and an adhesive (42c) permanently on 

said lower surface for temporarily bonding said second 
graphic (36) to said substrate (42a), thereby providing 

less adhesion between said dual function separating layer 
and said second graphic than between said second graphic 

and a surface to which said second graphic is to be 
applied, and said dual function separating layer provides 

a protective premask layer for said second graphic. 
A graphic package according to claim 1 wherein 
the substrate (42a) for said separating layer (42) is 

formed from a material selected from the group consisting 
of paper, synthetic polymers and natural polymers. 
A graphic package according to claim 2 wherein 
said synthetic polymer is selected from the group 

consisting of polyolefins, polyamides, urea-aldehydes, 
poly vinyl halides, polyacrylates and polyurethanes. 
A graphic package according to claim 3 wherein 
said adhesive (42c) on said separating layer (42) is a 

pressure sensitive adhesive. 
A graphic package according to claim 4 wherein 
said adhesive (42c) on said separating layer (42) is  

 
provided by a material selected from the group consisting 

of acrylics, natural rubbers, styrene-isoprene-styrene 
block copolymers, and silicone-based compositions. 
A graphic package according to claim 5 wherein 
said first graphic (34) can be applied to an article and 

further wherein the adhesion between said first graphic 
(34) and said article is greater than the adhesion 

between said separating layer (42) and said second 
graphic (36). 
A graphic package according to claim 4 wherein 
each of said plurality of graphics (32,34,36,38) is 

separated from an adjacent graphic by a separating layer 
(40,42,44) and further wherein the plurality of graphics 

(32,34,36,38) and separating layer(s) (40,42,44) are 
arranged in a stack. 
A graphic package according to claim 1 wherein 
said graphic package is a pad. 
A graphic package according to claim 8 wherein 
said graphic package further comprises a base (46) 

underlying and at least temporarily secured to said 
second graphic. 
A graphic package according to claim 9 wherein 
said graphic package further comprises a top sheet (48) 

overlying and at least temporarily secured to said first 
graphic.
