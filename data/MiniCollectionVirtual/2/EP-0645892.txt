<ABSTRACT>
The device (3) comprises, in the form of a phase-lock loop, a phase comparator (30), a filter (31), an oscillator (32) producing a local clock signal (S1) and two frequency divide-by M circuits (33, 34). These dividers receive the local signal (Sl) the frequency (fl) of which is slaved to N times the frequency (fp) of a pilot clock signal (Sp), with M
<
N, and are looped back onto the inputs of the comparator (30). The second divider (34) is reinitialised to the frequency (fp) of the pilot signal (Sp). A loading circuit (35) loads high-order stages of a counter included in the first divider (33) with a word (WORD) added to binary elements stored in the high-order stages of a counter included in the second divider (34), following a reinitialisation of the second divider (34) following general initialisation of the device (3).

<CLAIMS>
A device (3) for slaving a local frequency
(f) of a local clock signal (S1) to N times a master

frequency (fp) of a master clock signal (Sp), N being
a predetermined integer,

   comprising, in the form of a phase-locked loop,
phase comparing means (30) having first and second

inputs (30
1
 and 30
2
) and producing a control signal
(VC), filtering means (31) for filtering the control

signal (VC), oscillator means (32) controlled by the
filtered control signal for producing said local

clock signal (S1), and first divide-by-M frequency
divider means (33) receiving said local clock signal,

M being a predetermined integer less than N, for
dividing said local frequency (f1) into an

intermediate frequency (F) of a first slaving signal
(S3) applied to the first input (30
1
) of said phase
comparing means (100),

   characterized in that it comprises second
divide-by-M frequency divider means (34) receiving

said local clock signal and periodically reset at
said master frequency (fp) by the master clock signal

(Sp) for dividing said local frequency (f1) into the
intermediate frequency (F) of a second slaving signal

(S4) applied to the second input (30
2
) of said phase
comparing means (30) which compare respective phases

of said first and second slaving signals (S3, S4)
thereby producing said control signal (VC).
The device according to the claim 1,
characterized in that said first and second frequency 

divider means (33, 34) each include a modulo-M
counter, preferably programmable, incremented by said

local clock signal (S1).
A device according to the claim 2,
characterized in that it comprises means (35) for

adding a predetermined binary word (WORD) to binary
elements respectively stored in most-significant-bit

stages of the counter included in said second
frequency divider means (34) into a binary result,

thereby loading most-significant-bit stages of said
counter included in said first frequency divider

means (33) with said binary result, in response to a
general initialization of the device (3) and

periodically at said master frequency (fp) of the
master clock signal (Sp).
