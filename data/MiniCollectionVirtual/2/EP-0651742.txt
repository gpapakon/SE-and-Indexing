<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to cationic peroxyacids and to
bleaching and detergent compositions comprising said
peroxyacids.Cationic peroxyacids are known in the art. The use of such
materials as bleaching additives in detergent compositions
has also been described previously.For example, Japanese Patent Application 1056797 (Kao) is
concerned with a bleaching detergent composition comprising
peroxyacids of formula (I)

wherein:-
R1 is an, optionally substituted, C1-C24 alkyl or alkenyl or
alkaryl with a C1-C24 alkyl group;R2 and R3 are a C1-C3 alkyl, hydroxyalkyl, -(C2H4O)1-5H or
-Y-CO-O-O-H;X is a suitable anion; andY is a, substituted or unsubstituted linear or branched,
C1-C20 alkylene. Not only does this reference fail to
disclose how these materials are prepared but it also states
the peroxyacids are not stable.European Patent Specification 316 809 (Ausimont) is concerned
with salts of peroxyacids. In particular, it is concerned
with cationic peroxyacids having the general formula (II):
 
wherein:-
R, R1 and R2 are each independently hydrogen; an, optionally
substituted alkyl or two of said R, R1 and R2 are combined to
form an, optionally substituted, aliphatic or heterocylic ring
with the nitrogen atom to which they are attached;A is selected from, optionally substituted, alkylene,
cycloalkylene, arylene, cycloalkylene-alkylene, alkylene-cycloalkylene,
arylene-alkylene or alkylene-arylene, said
cycloalkylene or arylene units of the above groups being
optionally fused with one or more cycloaliphatic groups and
said alkylene units optionally having interspersed CONR3
groups wherein R3 is hydrogen, alkyl or aryl; andX represents HSO4, or CH3SO3; andn is an integer of from 1 to 6, preferably 1 or 2.
This reference also describes the use of these peroxyacids in
detergent formulations.The disadvantage of the materials exemplified in the examples
of EP 316 809 is that, with the exception of example 3, they
are formed.by protonation of the appropriate amino acid in
acid solution. In bleaching medium, that is normal washing
conditions where the pH of the solution is in the range of
from 9 to 10, the cationic aminoperoxyacids, which typically
have a pKa in the range of 9.5 to 10.5, will tend to, at
least partially, deprotonate leaving a non-cationic species.
Such species are known to be less active, in terms of
bleaching efficiency, than their cationic counterparts.
Thus, the peroxyacids exemplified in this reference would not
be expected to show the same high activity as their cationic
counterparts.
