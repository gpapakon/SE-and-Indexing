<ABSTRACT>
A throttle mechanism (10) for an engine 
of a motor vehicle comprising a throttle body (12) 

having an inner wall (36) defining a bore (38) 
extending therethrough and an outer wall (40), the 

bore having a longitudinal axis (X); a shaft (14) 
extending across the bore and having a longitudinal 

axis (Y) substantially perpendicular to the 
longitudinal axis of the bore, the shaft being 

rotatably mounted in the inner wall of the throttle 
body for pivotal movement about the longitudinal axis 

of the shaft, at least one end (42) of the shaft 
passing through the inner wall to extend beyond the 

outer wall; a flap valve (16) secured to the shaft 
inside the bore for movement between a fully open 

position and a substantially closed position on 
rotation of the shaft; a lever arm (18) secured to the 

said at least one end of the shaft adjacent the outer 
wall; means (20) connected to the outer wall of the 

throttle body for rotating the shaft; and idle adjust 
means (30) comprising a cam (146) having an aperture 

(150) therethrough through which a threaded shank of a 
screw (140) can freely pass to adjustably secure the 

cam to the outer wall, the cam having a surface (148) 
which is engaged by the lever arm at a position spaced 

from the said at least one end of the shaft, the 
rotational position of the cam relative to the screw 

determining the closed position of the flap valve.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a throttle 
mechanism for an engine of a motor vehicle, according to the preamble of claim 1 (see e.g. US-A-4902448). There are numerous designs of throttle 
mechanisms for engines which are well known to those 
skilled in the art. These known throttle mechanisms 
basically comprise a throttle body with a bore 
therethrough, a shaft extending across the bore and 
having a flap valve secured thereto, and means for 
rotating the shaft relative to the throttle body. 
Generally, the problem associated with these known 
designs is that for each design of engine, and/or for 
each application of the throttle mechanism, a 
different design of throttle mechanism is required in 
terms of the layout of the throttle mechanism and/or 
the layout of the elements attached to, or forming 
part of, the throttle mechanism. It is an object of the present invention to 
overcome one or more of these disadvantages. To this end, a throttle mechanism in 
accordance with the present invention comprises a 
throttle body having an inner wall defining a bore 
extending therethrough and an outer wall, the bore 
having a longitudinal axis; a shaft extending across 
the bore and having a longitudinal axis substantially 
perpendicular to the longitudinal axis of the bore, 
the shaft being rotatably mounted in the inner wall of 
the throttle body for pivotal movement about the 
longitudinal axis of the shaft, at least one end of 
the shaft passing through the inner wall to extend 
beyond the outer wall; a flap valve secured to the 
shaft inside the bore for movement between a fully 
open position and a substantially closed position on 
rotation of the shaft; a lever arm secured to the said 
at least one end of the shaft adjacent the outer wall; 
means connected to the outer wall of the throttle body  
 
for rotating the shaft; and idle adjust means 
comprising a cam having an aperture therethrough 
through which a threaded shank of a screw can freely 
pass to adjustably secure the cam to the outer wall, 
the cam having a surface which is engaged by the lever 
arm at a position spaced from the said at least one 
end of the shaft, the rotational position of the cam 
relative to the screw determining the closed position 
of the flap valve. This arrangement is such that it provides a 
simple design of idle adjust means which only requires 
a threaded bore to be formed in the outer wall of the 
throttle body, and can therefore be easily positioned 
at any required location without the need for separate 
designs of

<CLAIMS>
A throttle mechanism (10) for an engine 
of a motor vehicle comprising a throttle body (12) 

having an inner wall (36) defining a bore (38) 
extending therethrough and an outer wall (40), the 

bore having a longitudinal axis (X); a shaft (14) 
extending across the bore and having a longitudinal 

axis (Y) substantially perpendicular to the 
longitudinal axis of the bore, the shaft being 

rotatably mounted in the inner wall of the throttle 
body for pivotal movement about the longitudinal axis 

of the shaft, at least one end (42) of the shaft 
passing through the inner wall to extend beyond the 

outer wall; a flap valve (16) secured to the shaft 
inside the bore for movement between a fully open 

position and a substantially closed position on 
rotation of the shaft; a lever arm (18) secured to the 

said at least one end of the shaft adjacent the outer 
wall; means (20) connected to the outer wall of the 

throttle body for rotating the shaft; and idle adjust 
means (30) ; characterised in that the idle adjust 

means comprises a cam (146) having an aperture (150) 
therethrough through which a threaded shank of a screw 

(140) can freely pass to adjustably secure the cam to 
the outer wall, the cam having a surface (148) which 

is engaged by the lever arm at a position spaced from 
the said at least one end of the shaft, the rotational 

position of the cam relative to the screw determining 
the closed position of the flap valve. 
A throttle mechanism as claimed in Claim 
1, wherein the surface (148) of the cam (146) is 

substantially circular, and the aperture (150) through 
the cam is offset from the centre of the circular 

surface.  
 
A throttle mechanism as claimed in Claim 
1, wherein the surface of the cam is substantially 

oval. 
A throttle mechanism as claimed in any 
one of Claims 1 to 3, wherein the cam (146) is 

substantially cup-shaped and the screw (140) has a 
head (154) positioned inside the cup. 
A throttle mechanism as claimed in any 
one of Claims 1 to 4, wherein the screw (140) 

resiliently engages the cam (146) by way of a 
Belleville spring (156).
