Assembly comprised of two bodies of a sub-assembly, in particular one through which
fluid flows, in particular a modular unit for compressed air preparation, and a connection

device for the two bodies, with retaining sections (15, 15'; 16, 16') assigned in pairs to
bodies (3) placed together and located on opposite body sides (13,14) at right-angles to

the direction of attachment (5) of the bodies (3), and with connecting elements (24, 25)
attachable in a connecting position to the pairs of assigned retaining sections (15, 15'; 16,

16') and capable of being clamped by means of a clamping device (32) to the respectively
assigned pair of retaining sections (15, 15'; 16, 16') in a clamping direction (33) running

at right-angles to the direction of attachment (5), in order to clamp the bodies (3) together
in the area of their opposing joining faces (9, 9'), 
characterised in that
 there are provided
on the two bodies (3,3', 3") in the area of their opposing joining faces (9, 9') coupling

means (45, 46) which, before attachment of the connecting elements (24, 25), allow
coupling of the bodies (3, 3', 3") in such a way that in the clamping direction (33) the

bodies (3, 3', 3") are fixed so as to be capable of sliding relative to one another while at
the same time being fixed positively in the direction of attachment (5), and that on at least

one of the connecting elements (25) and on the body side (14) of the bodies (3, 3', 3")
facing this connecting element there are provided holding and securing means (57, 58)

which, with the connecting element (25) in the connecting position, act together in such a
way that the connecting element (25) is held on the bodies (3, 3', 3") even before the

clamping device (32) is actuated, while at the same time preventing displacement
between the two bodies (3, 3', 3").
Assembly according to claim 1, 
characterised in that
 the holding and securing means
(57, 58) are designed as a structural unit.
Assembly according to claim I or 2, 
characterised in that
 the connecting element (25)
provided with holding and securing means (57) is in the form of a bolt member, with

holding and securing means (57) which, in the connecting position, engage behind the 
holding and securing means (58) fitted to the bodies (3, 3', 3") at right-angles to the

clamping direction (33).
Assembly according to claim 3, 
characterised in that
 the bolt member is in the form of
a sliding bolt member which may be attached to the bodies (3, 3', 3") to be connected in a

basic position, and moved into the connecting position in a subsequent displacement
movement.
Assembly according to claim 4, 
characterised in that
 the direction of displacement
runs parallel to the joining plane (22) and to the body sides (14) of the bodies (3, 3', 3") to

be connected which have the holding and securing means (58).
Assembly according to claim 4 or 5, 
characterised in that
 the connecting element (25)
with the holding and securing means (57) is so designed that it may be positioned in the

basic position in the course of a swivelling-in movement (67).
Assembly according to any of claims 3 to 6, 
characterised in that
 the connecting
element (25), viewed in the position of use of the bodies (3, 3', 3"), may be guided into

the connecting position from above and remains in this position due to its intrinsic
weight.
Assembly according to any of claims 1 to 7, 
characterised in that
 the holding and
securing means (57) provided on the connecting element (25) are formed by one or more

hook sections (63) which, in the connecting position, engage behind one or more
projections (62) belonging to the body-side holding and securing means (58).
Assembly according to any of claims 1 to 8, 
characterised in that
 the connecting
element or elements (57) is or are in the form of a longitudinal element or elements and

have several holding and securing means (57) spaced apart longitudinally. 
Assembly according to any of claims 1 to 9, 
characterised in that
 the retaining
sections (15, 15'; 16, 16') are formed by projections provided
 on the bodies (3, 3', 3") and
overlapped in the connecting position of the connecting elements (24, 25) by mating

retaining sections (29) provided on the connecting elements.
Assembly according to claim 10, 
characterised in that
 the mating retaining sections
(29) are formed by side boundaries of pocket-like recesses (30) of the connecting

elements (24, 25).
Assembly according to claim 10 or 11, 
characterised in that
 the retaining sections
(15, 15'; 16, 16') and/or the mating retaining sections (29) have pressure-loading surfaces

(18, 19), each under pressure from the other part, running at an angle to the plane of
support.
Assembly according to any of claims 1 to 12, 
characterised in that
 the clamping
device (32) has at least one and expediently two clamping elements (34), which in the

operative state pass through the joining zone (10) between the two bodies (3, 3', 3") and
act on both connecting elements (24, 25).
Assembly according to claim 13, 
characterised in that
 the clamping elements (34) are
in the form of locking bolts (35) which have a thread (37) by which in the operative state

they are screwed into tapped holes (43) of the connecting element or elements (25)
