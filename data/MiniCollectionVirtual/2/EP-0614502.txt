Cardboard with a coating on one side, applied by 
means of cast-coating, characterised in that the side of 

the cardboard provided to receive the coating, before the 
application of the coating, has a water absorption according 

to Cobb of 25 to 40 g/m² in 60 sec., and the coating 
consists of: 


a film-forming synthetic resin binder having a film-forming 
temperature 
<
 40°C 
a natural binder in an amount of from 10 to 60% by 
weight, based on the total binder content, 
remainder: thickening agents and/or releasing agents 
and/or crosslinking agents in an amount of not more 

than 10% by weight in total, based on the total binder 
content. 
Cardboard according to Claim 1, characterised in 
that the cardboard is single-layered. 
Cardboard according to Claim 2, characterised in 
that it consists of cellulose fibres to 100%, based on the 

total fibre mass. 
Cardboard according to Claim 2, characterised in 
that it contains up to 5% by weight of mechanical wood pulp 

fibres, based on the total fibre mass. 
Cardboard according to Claim 1, characterised in 
that it is multi-layered and has a covering layer in which 

the fibre mass consists of cellulose to 100% or up to a 
maximum of 5% by weight of mechanical wood pulp fibres, 

remainder: cellulose fibres. 
Cardboard according to one of Claims 2 to 5, 
characterised in that it has a mass per unit area of 150 to 

350 g/m², calculated as fibre mass. 
Cardboard according to one of Claims 1 to 8, 
characterised in that it is impregnated with an  

 
impregnating fluid containing or consisting of a synthetic 

resin binder. 
Cardboard according to one of Claims 1 to 7, 
characterised in that the amount of synthetic resin binder 

applied by means of impregnation is 1 to 3 g/m², calculated 
as parts by dry weight. 
Cardboard according to one of Claims 1 to 6, 
characterised in that it has a satinised coating which is 

provided to receive the coating to be applied by means of 
cast-coating and which consists of one layer or two layers 

lying one upon the other, the layer(s) consisting of a 
composition containing film-forming synthetic resin binder 

and/or natural binder. 
Cardboard according to one of Claims 1 to 6, 
characterised in that it has a satinised coating which is 

provided to receive the coating to be applied by means of 
cast-coating and which consists of one layer or two layers 

lying one upon the other, the layer(s) consisting of a 
composition containing film-forming synthetic resin binder, 

and/or natural binder and mineral pigment. 
Cardboard according to one of Claims 1 to 10, 
characterised in that the side of the cardboard provided to 

receive the coating, before the application of the coating, 
has a Bekk smoothness of at least 50 sec. 
Cardboard according to one of Claims 1 to 11, 
characterised in that the proportion of natural binder in 

the coating applied on one side by means of cast-coating is 
from 20 to 35% by weight, based on the total binder 

content. 
Cardboard according to one of Claims 1 to 12, 
characterised in that the coating applied by means of cast-coating 

has a mass per unit area of at least 5 g/m². 
Cardboard according to one of Claims 1 to 13, 
characterised in that the coating applied by means of cast-coating 

has a mass per unit area of 
>
 10 to 15 g/m². 
Cardboard according to one of Claims 1 to 14,  
 

characterised in that the coating applied by means of cast-coating 
has a gloss measured at an angle of 75 degrees 

(according to Lehmann) of 88 to 98%. 
Method for producing a cardboard according to one 
of Claims 1 to 8 and 11 to 15, characterised in that the 

cardboard is impregnated with an impregnating fluid containing 
or consisting of a synthetic resin binder, is dried 

and satinised with a super or soft calender, and to the 
satinised surface there is applied a composition which 

consists of a film-forming synthetic resin binder, a 
natural binder in an amount of from 10 to 60% by weight, 

based on the total binder content, remainder: thickening 
agents and/or releasing agents and/or crosslinking agents 

in an amount of not more than 10% by weight in total, based 
on the total binder content, and in that the composition 

applied is levelled and contacted with a heated high gloss 
cylinder with simultaneous drying to form a high gloss 

coating. 
Method for producing a cardboard according to one 
of Claims 1 to 6 and 9 to 15, characterised in that on the 

cardboard, by means of coating one or more times with a 
composition containing or consisting of film-forming binder 

and/or natural binder, a coating is formed, the coating is 
dried and satinised, and to the satinised surface there is 

applied a composition which consists of a film-forming 
synthetic resin binder, a natural binder in an amount of 

from 10 to 60% by weight, based on the total binder content, 
remainder: thickening agents and/or releasing agents 

and/or crosslinking agents in an amount of not more than 
10% by weight in total, based on the total binder content, 

and in that the coating applied is levelled and contacted 
with a heated high gloss cylinder with simultaneous drying 

to form a high gloss surface. 
Use of a cardboard according to one of Claims 1 
to 15 as substrate for a metallic layer to be applied by 

the vacuum vapour process directly onto the coating
