<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a microminiature, monolithic, variable
electrical device, and, more particularly, to such a device constituted of a
basic "building block" comprising a deformable-mirror spatial light modulator
("SLM") functioning as a capacitor or switch.An SLM is made up of an array of small mirrors or reflectors, each of
which is capable of acting as a selective light-reflective pixel. Each pixel
reflects incident light along a path which depends on the position or
orientation of its mirror. Typically, each pixel mirror is movable (e.g. by
deflection or deformation) between a normal, first position or orientation and
one or more second positions or orientations. In only one position --either the
normal position or one of the second positions-- each pixel directs the incident
light along a selected path to a primary light-receiving site, for example, into
an optical system and from there onto a viewing surface or light-sensitive
paper. In all other pixel mirror positions, incident light is not directed along
the selected path to the primary site; rather, it is directed to either a
secondary site or to a "light sink" which absorbs or eliminates the light
which, therefore, does not reach the light-receiving site.An array of pixels may be used to reflect incident light in a pattern to
the primary site. A pixel array may take the form of a square or other 
othogonal matrix. In this event, the position of each pixel mirror, which
position is individually controllable by associated addressing facilities, may
be altered in a rasterized display to generate a video presentation. See
commonly assigned US Patents, 5,079,544; 5,061,049; 4,728,185 and
3,600,798. See also US Patents 4,356,730; 4,229,732; 3,896,338 and
3,886,310. A pixel array may also take other forms, for example, that of a
rectangular matrix, the length of which is much greater than its width. In
this latter event, the positions of the pixel mirrors, as determined by their
associated addressing facilities, may be individually, selectively altered so
that the reflected light prints characters in quasi-line-at-a-time fashion on
light sensitive paper. See commonly assigned US Patents 5,101,236 and
5,041,851. In both events, and in other use environments, appropriate
arrays and configurations of pixels/mirrors enable SLM's to modulate light in
amplitude-dominant or phase-dominant modes.There are at least four genera of SLM's: electro-optic, magneto-optic,
liquid crystal and deflectable (or deformable) mirror. The latter genus, often
