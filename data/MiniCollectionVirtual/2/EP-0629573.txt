<ABSTRACT>
A pickup and feed unit (1) for stacks (2) of 
blanks, wherein a movable pickup head (7) provides for 

successively picking up the stacks (2) off a pallet (3), 
on which the stacks (2) are arranged and oriented in 

given manner, and for feeding them to a receiving member 
(64). The head (7) presents a frame (29) oriented in a 

given manner in relation to the receiving member (64); 
and a pickup device (43) with suction cups (39), 

rotating in relation to the frame (29) and about a 
vertical axis (33), so that the stacks (2), once picked 

up, are always oriented the same way in relation to the 
frame (29) and the receiving member (64).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a pickup and feed
unit for stacks of blanks.In particular, the present invention relates to a
unit which may be used to advantage for successively
picking up stacks of blanks off a supporting surface-normally
defined by a pallet on which the stacks are
placed next to one another, and arranged and oriented in
known orderly manner - and feeding the stacks, with the
same given orientation, to a receiving member at an
unloading station.Known pickup and feed devices for stacks of blanks
comprise a powered pickup head for positively engaging
the stack, and which is normally guided along three
perpendicular axes: two horizontal axes parallel to the
stack supporting surface; and one vertical axis
perpendicular to the supporting surface.EP-A-581188 discloses a pickup and feed unit for
stacks of blanks arranged in a given manner on a
horizontal supporting surface. The unit comprises a
pickup head, which is mounted on a first fixed frame for
moving in space in three different directions, and
comprises a second frame having a fixed orientation in
relation to the first frame and a receiving station,
pickup means mounted on the second frame for rotating
about a vertical axes to successively pick stacks up and 
off the supporting surface, and a blade which is mounted
on the second frame and is movable to and from an
operating position facing the pickup means for
supporting a stack picked up by the pickup means.In use, the pickup head is moved in space to put
the pickup means in an engagement position in relation
to a stack, the pickup means are activated for picking
the stack up, the blade is set in the operating
position, and finally the pickup means deposit the
picked up stack on the blade.If the stack has an incorrect orientation in
relation to the receiving station, the pickup means are
rotated about a vertical axes for setting the stack in
the correct orientation prior to depositing the stack on
the blade.Once the stack is deposited on the blade, the
pickup head is moved to an unloading position for
feeding the stack to the receiving station. If the stack
is not correctly positioned on the blade, the feeding of
the stack to the receiving station may result difficult
and/or problems may arise for the successive utilization
of the stack.It is an object of the present invention to provide
a straightforward, low-cost, highly reliable pickup unit
designed to overcome the aforementioned drawback.According to the present invention, there is
provided a pickup and feed unit for stacks of

<CLAIMS>
A pickup and feed unit for stacks (2) of blanks
arranged in a given manner on a horizontal supporting

surface (3); the unit comprising a pickup head (7), a
first fixed frame (6) on which the pickup head (7) is

mounted in a movable manner, first actuating means (16,
20, 28) to move the pickup head (7) in relation to said

first frame (6) and in space in three different
directions, and a receiving member (64); the pickup head

(7) comprising a second frame (29) having a fixed
orientation in relation to the first frame and the

receiving member (64), pickup means (43) mounted on the
second frame (29) to successively pick stacks (2) up and

off said supporting surface (3), and a movable element
(54) which is mounted on the second frame (29) and is

movable to and from an operating position facing the
pickup means (43) for supporting a stack (2) picked up

by the pickup means (43); characterized in that said
pickup head (7) comprises detecting means (62) for

detecting a position of a stack (2) on said movable
element (54) ; said movable element (54) comprising

positioning means (60) controlled by said detecting
means (62) for positioning a stack (2) supported by the

movable element (54) in a constant predetermined
position in relation to the movable element (54). 
A unit as claimed in Claim 1, characterized in
that said movable element (54) is mounted for rotation

about a horizontal axis (58).
A unit as claimed in Claim 2, characterized in
that said movable element (54) comprises a fork (54)

rotating about said horizontal axis (58) and having a
plate (55) for supporting a stack (2); and an actuator

(59) for rotating the fork (54), about said horizontal
axis (58) and in relation to said pickup means (43), to

and from said operating position.
A unit as claimed in any one of the foregoing
Claims, characterized in that said stacks (2) arranged

on said horizontal supporting surface have orientations which
differ in relation to one another by a multiple,

including zero, of an angle of 90° about respective axes
(33a) perpendicular to the supporting surface (3); said

pickup means (43) being mounted on the second frame (29)
for rotating about a vertical axis (33); and said pickup

head (7) further comprising second actuating means (44,
45, 46) for indexing the pickup means (43) about said

vertical axis (33) through a number, including zero, of
angles of 90° each, to impart each stack (2), once

picked up, a constant predetermined final orientation in
relation to the second frame (29) and the receiving

member (64).
A unit as claimed in Claim 4, characterized in
that it comprises detecting means (48) for detecting the 

angular position of the pickup means (43) about said
vertical axis (33).
A unit as claimed in Claim 4 or 5, characterized
in that said second frame (29) comprises a tubular first

body (30) coaxial with said vertical axis (33); and said
pickup means (43) comprise a second body (32) coaxial

with said vertical axis (33) and engaging said first
body (30) in rotary and axially-fixed manner; and drive

means (46, 44) for rotating the second body (32) in
relation to the first body (30) and about said vertical
