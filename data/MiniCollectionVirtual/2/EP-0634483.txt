<ABSTRACT>
There is provided a bleaching composition comprising 
alkali metal percarbonate as an oxygen releasing compound 

and alkali metal carbonate or bicarbonate particles of 
defined size (mean particle size of 250µm or greater) 

preferably fewer than 20% of the particles have a particle 
size of below 250µm and fewer than 5% of the particles have 

a particle size of below 150µm). The particulate bleaching 
composition may form a component of a machine dishwashing 

composition, a bleach booster composition or in particular 
a laundry detergent composition. The percarbonate has 

increased storage stability in the compositions of the 
invention.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to bleaching compositions
comprising alkali metal percarbonate as an oxygen-releasing
compound and alkali metal carbonate or bicarbonate
particles. These bleaching compositions are useful as
components of laundry detergent compositions, machine
dishwashing compositions and bleach booster compositions,
in particular laundry detergent compositions.Bleaching compositions containing alkali metal
percarbonate are known in the art. Percarbonate is an
attractive perhydrate bleaching agent for use in bleaching
compositions because it dissolves readily in water and is
weight efficient. In laundry detergent compositions it is
particularly useful because after giving up its available
oxygen it provides a useful source of carbonate ions for
detergency purposes and does not provide undesirable byproducts.The inclusion of percarbonate salts in bleaching
compositions has been restricted hitherto by the relative
instability of the bleach. In particular, percarbonate
salts decompose rapidly when stored in a moist and/or warm
atmosphere.Bleaching compositions containing percarbonate as a
bleaching component usually also contain carbonate such as
sodium carbonate. This acts to neutralise acidity released
when the composition is added to water. Such acidity
inhibits the performance of the percarbonate and may
inhibit the performance of other components of the
bleaching composition, for instance enzymes in the case of
laundry detergent compositions. In the case of granular
zeolite-built detergent compositions the carbonate acts
also to facilitate processing of the zeolite-containing
composition into granules.However, the presence of carbonate particles can
contribute to reduced storage stability of the
percarbonate. During storage, in particular storage under 
cool conditions, carbonate particles can absorb moisture,
which is released during storage in warm conditions, far
instance at above 30°C. In the resulting warm, moist
atmosphere the storage stability of the percarbonate is
reduced.It has been attempted to solve this problem by coating
the carbonate particles. However this is a complex and
expensive process and may reduce the ability of the
carbonate to absorb moisture; this moisture-absorption
ability is an advantageous one, therefore to reduce it is
not preferred.According to the invention there is provided a
particulate composition comprising:
(a) an alkali metal percarbonate salt
and(b) particles of alkali metal carbonate or
bicarbonate, said particles having a mean
particle size of 250µm or
