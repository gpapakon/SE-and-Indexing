<ABSTRACT>
System for packaging tree balls, according to which use is made of an elastic membrane (4) as a covering element for the balls (2) which is in the form of a globe made of biodegradable material and which is stretched in the manner of an inflated balloon to put it in place, by creating an external vacuum, thus forming a hollow for the introduction of a ball (2) to be covered, while, once in this state, said membrane is let free and the latter recloses under the effect of reassuming its elastic shape, adapting to the ball (2) accommodated on the inside; the stretching means are arranged inside a body in the form of a tank (5) which can be arranged together with an activating group (7), thus forming an autonomous unit.
