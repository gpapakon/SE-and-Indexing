<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a medicament-impregnated 
alginate fibre. More particularly, the 
invention concerns a fibre from which medicament can be 
released in a controlled manner, and to the application 
of this fibre in the preparation of alginate fabrics and 
wound dressings. A number of methods for producing conventional 
alginate fibres are described in the art. The extrusion 
of alginate solutions into an agueous solution containing 
calcium ions to form yarns of calcium alginate filaments 
is known, for example, from British Patents Nos. 567641, 
568177, 571657 and 624987. Such fabrics were generally 
prepared by knitting a yarn of calcium alginate filaments 
and partially converting the calcium alginate to the 
sodium form to form a calcium/sodium alginate containing, 
for example, 30-70 percent by weight of the carboxyl 
groups of the alginate in the calcium form. US Patent No. 4421583 discloses a process for 
making a non-woven alginate fabric useful as a wound 
dressing which comprises spreading a tow of calcium 
alginate filaments in a flow of water; overfeeding the 
spread filaments onto a water-pervious support so that 
the filaments cross over each other; and drying the 
filaments so that the filaments become bonded to each 
other at their points of contact where they cross over 
each other. Non-woven alginate fabrics having this high 
calcium content of 70 to 95 percent are said to be useful 
for example as throat swabs, which after swabbing are 
dissolved in sodium hexametaphosphate solution. The non-woven 
alginate fabrics can be treated such that calcium  
 
is partially replaced by sodium, for example by treatment 
with alcoholic sodium hydroxide and sodium acetate so 
that from 30 to 70 percent of the carboxyl groups are in 
the sodium form. The sodium calcium alginate fabrics 
produced are said to be useful as haemostatic wound 
dressings which can be absorbed by body fluids, for use 
for example in deep surgery or after tooth extraction. WO-A-84/03705 describes a method of producing 
alginate fibres for fabric of increased solubility in 
water or saline solutions for application in the medical 
field and in particular for haemostatic dressings. US Patent No. 4562110 describes a method of 
producing dried alginate fibre material which comprises 
spinning an alginate solution into an agueous salt bath. 
The wet-spun continuous fibres of insoluble alginate, in 
which the fibres are separate but generally parallel, are 
collected, and the sheet of fibres is laid on a moving 
co
