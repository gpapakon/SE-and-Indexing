<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to the field of welding, more particularly, to methods
of making welded joint
s for pieces (1,2) of maraging steels, and may be used in
different branches of machine building.
Before welding, an intermediate element (3) is resistance spot welded to one of
the welded edges. The element is made of the product's material and covered with

a layer of chromium. The joint is fit up by tacks on a weld backing (4) made of the
same material as the product. The tacks are made by a manual argon-arc welding

by a nonconsumable electrode. The joint is argon-arc welded by two runs of a
nonconsumable electrode at transverse oscillations of the same (Fig.1).

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a
method of making welded joints for products of maraging steels, and can find
application in manufacturing various components in the rocket and aircraft
industry and other engineering branches.A method for welding high-strength alloys, comprising welding an insert
between the pieces jointed, is known in the art (SU Inventor's Certificate
No.336111, 1972).However, in this case the insert is made of a material having a less strength
than that of the material of the welded pieces, resulting in the reduced strength of
the welded joint as a whole.Further, a method for making a
welded joint, comprising the steps of resistance welding a thin metal backing of
the same metal as that of a filling wire to an edge of one of pieces welded,
fitting up a joint, and welding at a constant current of opposite polarity
is known from the
JP Application No. 58-9779, published in 1983.The method permits obtaining high-quality joints in products made of heat-resistant
stainless steels and carbon steels. However, there exist a number of
structures of maraging steels that could not be welded by the prior art method
without cracks.Document US-A-5 688 419, which is considered to represent the most relevant state of
the art for the present application, describes a method of making welded joints, suitable
for products of maraging steels, including the following steps :
a- fitting up welded pieces with an intermediate element disposed therebetween, the
intermediate element being made of the same metal as that of the welded pieces,b- argon-arc welding of the pieces together with the intermediate element with argon
being fed to a weld produced, the argon-arc welding being made by a first and a
second run of a non consumable electrode at transverse oscillations of the
electrode relative to the weld.It is an object of the invention to provide an improvement in quality of a
welded joint for components made of maraging steels.A method in accordance with the invention provides a welded joint free of
the shrinkage and cold cracks when welding pieces of maraging steels.The object of the invention is achieved in a method of making a welded
joint, comprising the steps of: resistance spot welding an intermediate element to
an edge of one of pieces welded, fitting up the welded pieces and welding,
wherein the intermediate element is made of the same metal as that of the welded
pieces and covered with a layer of chromium, the pieces are fit up by tacking
using a manual argon-arc welding with a nonconsumable electrode on

<CLAIMS>
A method of making a welded joint for products of mavaging steels, including the follwing steps: resistance spot welding
an intermediate element to an edge of one of pieces welded, the intermediate

element being made of the same metal as that of the welded pieces, fitting up the
welded pieces with the intermediate element disposed therebetween, argon-arc

welding of the pieces together with the intermediate element with argon being fed
to a weld produced, wherein that the intermediate element is covered

with a layer of chromium before the welding, the welded pieces are fit up by
tacking the pieces using a manual argon-arc welding with a nonconsumable

electrode on a weld backing of the same metal as that of the pieces, the argon-arc
welding being made by a first and a second run of a nonconsumable electrode at

transverse oscillations of the electrode relative to the weld, the weld backing
being kept after welding.
A method as set forth in claim 1, wherein when ring joints
are welded, the argon-arc welding is made at a fixed position of the pieces.
A method as set forth in claim 2, wherein the second run is
made by two half-turns of downhill welding, with overlapping a beginning and an

end of a weld made during a first half-turn in the opposite direction.
A method as set forth in claim 1, 2 or 3, wherein the transverse
oscillations of the nonconsumable electrode are made at a frequency of 60-80

oscillations per minute.
A method as set forth in claim 1, 2, 3 or 4, wherein the first run is
made at a reduced welding current comprising 30-70% of a current strength in

the second run.
A method as set forth in claim 1,2,3,4 or 5, wherein holes are provided
in the weld backing for feeding argon to a weld root therethrough.
