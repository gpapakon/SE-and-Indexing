<ABSTRACT>
1. Aqueous epoxy resin dispersions containing     (A) an epoxy resin which is a product of the condensation of   (A-1) from 50 to 95 % by weight, preferably from 55 to 85 % by weight, of one or more epoxide compound(s) containing at least two epoxide groups per molecule and having an epoxide equivalent weight of from 100 to 2000 g/mol, (A-2) from 5 to 50 % by weight, preferably from 15 to 45 % by weight, of an aromatic polyol and (A-3) from 0 to 25 % by weight, preferably from 0 to 10 % by weight, of modifying compounds containing at least two epoxide reactive groups,     (B) a dispersant comprising   (B-1) a product of the condensation of a polyol having an average molecular weight of (Mw) of from 200 to 20,000 g/mol and an epoxide compound containing on average at least two epoxide groups per molecule and having an epoxide equivalent weight of from 100 to 10,000 g/mol and   (B-2) optionally further, preferably nonionic surfactants,   (C) the polymer, prepared in this dispersion, of ethylenically unsaturated monomers capable of free-radical polymerisation or copolymerisation,   (D) a curing agent for the epoxy resin (A) and   (E) optionally conventional additives and catalysts.   These aqueous epoxy resin dispersions are suitable for the production of coatings, in particular for the internal coatings of beverage cans and preserve cans.

<CLAIMS>
A process for preparing aqueous epoxy resin
dispersions, in the first step of which an epoxy

resin (A) is prepared from

from 50 to 95% by weight of one or more
epoxide compounds (A-1) containing at least

two epoxide groups per molecule and having an
epoxide equivalent mass of from 100 to

2000 g/mol,
from 5 to 50% by weight of an aromatic polyol
(A-2),

at least a portion of an ethylenically unsaturated
monomer according to (C) capable of free-radical

polymerization or copolymerization being added to
the said resin, followed by the homogenous

incorporation of a dispersant (B) comprising a
condensation product (B-1) of a polyol having a

weight average molar mass M
w
 of from 200 to
20,000 g/mol and an epoxide compound containing on

average at least two epoxide groups per molecule
and having an epoxide equivalent mass of from 100

to 10,000 g/mol, and finally water, in portions,
is metered into this mixture,

and subsequently, following addition of an
initiator and of any remainder of the monomers 

according to (C), a free-radical polymerization of
these monomers (C) is performed.
The process for preparing aqueous epoxy resin
dispersions as claimed in claim 1, wherein the

preparation of the epoxy resin (A) is additionally
carried out using compounds (A-3) in a fraction of

up to 25% by weight, selected from polyamines,
polyalkylene oxides having terminal amino groups,

polycarboxylic acids and aliphatic polyols.
The process for preparing aqueous one-component
epoxy resin dispersions as claimed in claim 1,

wherein following the polymerization a curing
agent (D) is added.
The process for preparing aqueous one-component
epoxy resins dispersions as claimed in claim 3,

wherein the curing agent (D) is selected from the
group consisting of amines, amides, Lewis acids,

phenols, carboxylic acids, carboxylic anhydrides
and amino resins.
The process as claimed in claim 3, wherein the
curing agent (D) comprises one or more carboxyl-containing

compounds, at least one of these
compounds containing at least three carboxyl

groups per molecule.
The process for preparing aqueous epoxy resin
dispersions as claimed in claim 1, wherein the

dispersant (B) further comprises a surfactant.
A process for preparing aqueous epoxy resin
dispersions, wherein the dispersant (B) further

comprises a nonionic surfactant.
