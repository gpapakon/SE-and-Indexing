<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to an apparatus for the treatment of articles of clothing hung on a bust (2) by means of steam and/or air, especially hot air, directed into the articles of clothing from below, in which apparatus the bust stands on a baseplate (26) having steam and/or air and/or hot-air outlet orifices (28) which communicate with a steam and/or air and/or hot-air feed coming from the pedestal (40, 42) of the bust, the said apparatus being characterised in that the pedestal has a housing with a vertical partition wall (46), to which a first motor (50) driving a first radial blower (48) is attached on one side at the bottom and a second motor (52) is attached above it on one side and a second radial blower (54) driven by the second motor is attached on the other side, the diameters of the radial blowers being larger than the diameters of the motors, and an upper region (56) of the first radial blower overlapping a lower region (58) of the second radial blower.
