<ABSTRACT>
A pneumatic tire for all seasons comprises a 
tread provided with a foamed rubber containing a given 

amount of a particular resin having specified hardness 
and average particle size, and having specified 

expansion ratio, average expanded cell size and storage 
modulus (E') at -20°C of a given range, and exhibits 

satisfactory braking and traction performances at not 
only dry-on-ice state but also wet-on-ice state while 

sufficiently holding the steering stability, durability 
and low fuel consumption in summer season.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to pneumatic tires, and 
more particularly to a pneumatic studless tire for all 
seasons having considerably improved traction 
performance, braking performance and steering 
performance in running on snow and ice road surfaces 
(hereinafter referred to as ice-snow performances 
simply) without degrading the steering stability, 
durability and wear resistance required in summer season. Recently, it is increasing to demand so-called 
all season tires capable of using in winter season 
likewise summer season without tire change. Even in the 
winter season, the tire of this type has the same dry 
gripping property, wet gripping property, steering 
property, durability and low fuel-consumption as in the 
summer season and further possesses sufficient traction 
and braking performances on ice and snow roads. As a tread rubber used in the tire of this type, 
it is required to reduce a hardness at a low temperature 
in a tread rubber for summer season. In this connection,  
 
there is known a method of using a polymer having a low 
glass transition point, or a method of using a softening 
agent to properly maintain a modulus of elasticity at 
low temperature. However, the former method develops substantially 
the performance on ice-snow temperature region owing to 
hysteresis property of the polymer, but has a problem 
that the braking performance and steering property on 
wet road surface and dry road surface are insufficient. 
The latter method is disclosed in JP-A-55-135149, 
JP-A-58-199203, JP-A-60-137945 and the like and has a 
problem that the use of softening agent badly affects 
the wear resistance and durability in the running on 
general-purpose road in comparison with the improvement 
of ice-snow performance. In the aforementioned conventional techniques, 
the ice-snow performance at a relatively lower 
temperature region of not higher than -5°C or so-called 
dry-on-ice state is certainly improved, but sufficient 
friction coefficient is not obtained in the ice-snow 
performance at a wet state near to 0°C or so-called wet-on-ice 
state, so that it can not be said that the 
traction performance, braking performance and steering 
stability are sufficiently improved.  It is, therefore, an object of the invention to 
provide a pneumatic studless tire for true all seasons 
developing sufficient braking and traction performances 
at not only dry-on-ice state but also wet-on-ice state 
while sufficiently ensuring the steering stability, 
durability and low fuel consumption in summer
