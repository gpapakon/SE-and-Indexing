<ABSTRACT>
The invention provides a gear position 
indicating arrangement in an automatic transmission 

shift control device which makes it possible to obtain 
two kinds of devices, i.e., one for a right-hand drive 

vehicle and one for a left-hand drive vehicle, using a 
number of common parts. In the device, a base bracket (2) 

is a common part and can be used for both of the kinds. 
An indicator cover (9) to be installed on the base bracket (2) 

can also be used for both of the kinds by reversing the 
front and rear ends thereof in case of a left-hand 

drive vehicle as compared with those in case of a 
right-hand drive vehicle. A bulb case (10) is a part 

independent from the indicator cover (9) and the base 
bracket (2) and adapted to be fastened to a right-hand side 

of the base bracket (2) in case of a right-hand drive 
vehicle and to a left-hand side of the base bracket (2) in 

case of a left-hand drive vehicle.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates in general to an 
automatic transmission shift control device for 
automotive vehicles and more particularly to a gear 
position indicating arrangement in such an automatic 
transmission shift control device. A kind of automatic transmission shift control 
device includes a base bracket fixedly attached to a 
vehicle body, a shift lever swingably or rotatably 
supported on the base bracket, the base bracket being 
formed with a hollow gate portion for allowing the 
swinging or rotation of the shift lever, and an 
indicator for indicating a selected gear position. The 
indicator is installed on the upper end of the base 
bracket whilst allowing the shift lever to extend 
upward therethrough. The indicator consists of an indicator cover 
formed with an elongated opening through which the 
shift lever extends and an indicator window, a slide 
plate placed under the elongated opening and movable 
together with the shift lever, a dial panel fitted in 
the indicator window and having marks indicating 
respective gear positions, and a bulb case 
accommodating a light bulb for lighting up the dial 
panel. Each marks on the dial panel consists of 
graduations corresponding to the gear positions or 
speed ranges and marks of letters of alphabet such as  
 
"P", "R", "D" and "L" and figures such as "1" and "2". 
The graduations are positioned at one side of the dial 
panel nearer to the shift lever. Arrangements of the control button at the top 
end of the shift lever, the dial panel and the bulb 
case in a left-hand drive vehicle need be reversed as 
compared with those in a right-hand drive vehicle. For 
this reason, it has heretofore been practiced to 
manufacture two kinds of automatic transmission shift 
control devices independently and install them on the 
respective kinds of vehicles. In the shift control device, irrespective of 
whether it is used in a right-hand drive vehicle or a 
left-hand drive vehicle, the shift lever in the "P" 
position is held nearly perpendicularly to the vehicle 
floor and is shifted therefrom into the respective gear 
positions through rearward rotation of predetermined 
select angles. Such select angles are for example determined so 
as to be within the following ranges. An angle between 
the "P" position and the "R" position is within the 
range from 10 to 11 degrees. An angle between the "P" 
position and the "N" range is within the range from 15 
to 16 degrees. An angle between the "P" position and 
the "D" position is within the range from 20
