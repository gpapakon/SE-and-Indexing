<ABSTRACT>
The invention pertains to a collision protection device, in particular for vehicle passengers, with an air bag that is made of a coated or uncoated fabric and that has an attachement piece on the gas inflow side, an upper part (passenger impact side) and retaining straps (1', 2'). The ends of the retaining straps are connected to other components or to each other (joints). In order to ensure exact placement and operational reliability in connecting the free ends of the retaining straps (1', 2') to each other or the other components of the air bag, it is absolutely essential that the retaining strap ends and, as needed, the other components be exactly positioned and set before they are joined. For this purpose the retaining straps (1', 2') or other components of the air bag have a perforation (6), one or more projecting parts or one or more recesses in the area of the joins (3').
