<ABSTRACT>
The mechanical damper (70) is fabricated from a 
relatively thin metal spring stock and formed in cross-section 

to an E-shape that is arcuately bent into a ring 
that fits into the cavity defined between the inner 

diameter of the inner shroud (24) and the outer diameter 
of the segmented back rings (40) of the honeycomb 

sealing structure (30) of the stator for the compressor 
of a gas turbine engine. The E-shaped damper is 

segmented and provides damping of the compressor stator 
of a gas turbine engine and is particularly adapted for 

stators that are formed from integrally cast stator 
vanes (12) and shrouds (24).

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to mechanical spring-type
dampers and particularly to means for damping cast
stators used e.g. on compressors for gas turbine
engines.As is well known in the gas turbine engine art,
integrally cast stator vanes and shrouds are inherently
not capable of providing damping. In the interest of
reducing cost in a gas turbine engine, it is desirable
to utilize cast parts whenever and wherever practical.
The compressor stators and particularly the stators used
on the high pressure compressor have proven to be likely
candidates where cast parts can be utilized. However,
as was mentioned in the above, because cast stator vanes
and shrouds inherently do not have damping capabilities
in comparison with other similar fabricated designs, the
lack of damping has been a major obstacle standing in
the way of utilizing cast parts.As is obvious to one skilled in this art and well
known in this industry, damping is essential. Damping is
not only necessary to withstand the exceedingly high
vibratory stresses incidental in aircraft operation, it
must also keep the parts out of resonance to assure
their adequate life. It is therefore imperative that
damping be incorporated in cast parts in order to attain
the desired structural integrity needed in this
environment.Another obstacle that faces the designer of
aircraft engine hardware is the limited available space
for incorporating dampers. Obviously, commercially
available dampers are non-existent and hence
unavailable. To this end, this invention contemplates a
mechanical spring-like damper that is capable of
providing sufficient loading required for damping the
vibratory energy existing in this hostile environment 
and being sufficiently small to be able to fit into the
limited space of the available envelope of a high
pressure compressor stator of a gas turbine engine.GB-2219355 discloses using a resilient spring
member as a damper which is slidable on an inner air
seal and/or a stator vane.An object of this invention is to provide a damper
for a cast stator for a gas turbine engine.According to the present invention, there is
provided the combination as claimed in claims 1 and 2.A feature of this invention is to provide a
spring-like damper that is fabricated from a highly
resilient, flexible preferably metallic spring material
which is shaped in the form of an "E" in cross-section.Another feature of this invention is to provide an
annular E-shaped spring damper (either segmented or
continuous) that is sufficiently small to fit into a
cavity located
