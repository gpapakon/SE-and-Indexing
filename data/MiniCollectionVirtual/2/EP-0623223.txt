<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a method and apparatus 
for acoustic shear wave logging. It has long been known to acoustically log open 
wellbores to determine the velocities of compression 
("P") waves and shear ("S") waves traveling through 
rock formations located in the wellbore region. Logging 
devices have been used for this purpose which normally 
comprise a sound source (i.e., transmitter) and one or 
more receivers disposed at pre-selected distances from 
the sound sources. The use of remotely spaced, multiple 
receivers is intended to aid in distinguishing between 
various arriving wave fronts since travel time 
differentials increase with increasing distance from 
the transmitter, as described in US-A-4383308. Such arriving wave fronts generally include both 
headwaves and guided waves. A first arriving event is 
the headwave commonly called a compressional wave which 
represents acoustic energy which has been refracted 
through the formation adjacent the wellbore. This 
compressional wave travels as a fluid pressure wave in 
the wellbore mud from the transmitter to the formation 
where it travels at the compressional wave velocity of 
the particular formation. The compressional wave then 
travels to the receiver through the wellbore mud as a 
fluid pressure wave. A second arriving event is the headwave commonly 
called a shear wave which is also refracted through the 
formation adjacent the wellbore. Unlike the 
compressional wave, the shear wave travels at shear 
velocity through the formations. The particles of the 
formation along the path of propagation are vibrated in 
a direction perpendicular to the direction of the 
propagation of the wave.  
 A third arriving event is the guided wave commonly 
called a tube wave or Stoneley wave which causes a 
radial bulging and contraction of the borehole and its 
travel is, therefore, associated with the borehole 
wall, that is, the boundary between the borehole fluids 
and the formation solids. A fourth arriving event is the guided wave 
commonly called a normal mode, pseudo-Rayleigh wave, or 
reflected conical wave. The travel of this normal mode 
is restricted to the borehole and has an oscillatory 
pattern normal to its direction of travel. Normally, 
the shear wave is indistinguishable from the onset of 
this normal mode due to concurrent arrival times. Various signal timing and wave front analysis 
methods have also been suggested for distinguishing 
between these various wave fronts received at a given 
receiver. Most of these methods involve
