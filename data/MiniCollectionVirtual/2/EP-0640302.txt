<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to an apparatus for the
storage and application of cosmetics, and more particularly,
though not exclusively, to an apparatus for the storage
and application of mascara to the eyelashes
as well as a method for the application of a cosmetic.The development and widespread use of apparatuses
for the storage and application of mascara to the eyelashes have
served to focus on the shortcomings and problems to be
solved in the design of such apparatuses. Although there
have been many improvements in their design, several
problems have not been overcome.One problem encountered is difficulty in applying
the mascara to the brush and the eyelashes evenly. This
difficulty is due partly to the tendency of the mascara to
thicken in the container over periods of time. The thick
mascara tends to accumulate on and stick to the applicator
brush making it difficult to apply evenly. Present mascara packaging incorporates a part that
is commonly referred to as the "wiper". Generally, the
wiper is formed by an orifice in the container. As the
applicator brush bearing mascara is withdrawn from the
reservoir containing the mascara, the applicator brush comes
into contact with the rim of the orifice. This contact is
intended to ensure that excess mascara is removed from the
brush, preparing it for use.A disadvantage of this method of removal is the
fact that the wiping action by the rim of the orifice tends
to strip all mascara from the tips of the bristles of the
brush, leaving the central portion of the brush loaded with
mascara. Thus, when the brush is applied to the eyelashes,
the eyelashes are deflected by the bristle tips and fail to
contact the mascara.Another disadvantage of the device described above
is the tendency of the orifice wiper to leave a tail or
'blob' of mascara suspended from the tip of the applicator.
This blob has to be removed before the applicator brush is
applied to the eyelashes.Yet another disadvantage of circular orifice
wipers is their inability to evenly wipe brushes with
asymmetrical, contoured or otherwise varied profiles. Thus,
brushes that have a change in profile either radially or
axially tend to be primed with mascara in a non-uniform
distribution.A further problem results from the tendency of the
orifice wipers, presently in use, to strip large clumps of
dried or caked mascara from the applicator when the
applicator is re-inserted into the reservoir. These clumps
accumulate on the wiper and are frequently picked up by the 
brush when the brush is subsequently removed

<CLAIMS>
A cosmetic apparatus (2) for use in the application of mascara (6)
comprising:


a container (4) for holding mascara comprising a cavity and
having at least one opening (16);
at least one applicator (8) having a first end (8a) comprising a first
plurality of bristles for capturing mascara theron while the applicator is

within the container and for the application of mascara to the user and
having a second end comprising a means (8b) for handling the applicator;
an applicator wiper (14) inside the container; characterised in that
the wiper comprises a second plurality of bristles (14b) extending into the

cavity and forming a region through which the first end (8a) of the applicator (8) is passed when
the applicator (8) is removed from the container (4), whereby said first plurality of

bristles intermingle with said second plurality of bristles (14b) causing any
clumps of or excess mascara on the first end (8a) of the applicator (8) to be removed when

the first end (8a) of the
applicator (
8) is withdrawn from the container (4) past the second plurality of bristles (14b).
A cosmetic apparatus according to claim 1, wherein the second end of the
applicator (8) further comprises means (8b) for capping the opening of the

container.
A cosmetic apparatus according to claim 1 or claim 2, wherein the
applicator wiper (14) is disposed on the inner surface of the container (4).
A cosmetic apparatus according to any one of claims 1 to 3, wherein the
second plurality of bristles (14b) extend from the wall of the container (8) into the 

cavity.
A cosmetic apparatus according to any one of claims 1 to 4, wherein the
applicator wiper (14) is disposed in the vicinity of the opening of the container (4).
A cosmetic apparatus according to any one of claims 1 to 5, wherein the
applicator wiper (14) is integral with the inner wall of the container (4).
A cosmetic apparatus according to any one of claims 1 to 5, wherein the
applicator wiper (14) is an insert, the outer surface of which is fixedly attached to the inner

surface of the container (4) so as to define a bore of a diameter which is smaller
than the diameter of the applicator (8), whereby the first end (8a) of the applicator (8)

engages said wiper (14) to remove excess mascara therefrom when the
first end (8a) of the applicator (8)

is withdrawn from the container (4) through the applicator wiper (14).
A cosmetic apparatus according to any one of claims 1 to 7, wherein the second plurality of
bristles (14b) are arranged in a helical distribution.
A cosmetic apparatus according to any one of claims 1 to 8, wherein the second plurality of
