<ABSTRACT>
A conformable marking tape having improved mechanical properties comprises a support base and a top-coat layer, the support base comprising a highly saturated acrylonitrile elastomer grafted with a zinc salt of methacrylic acid. The top-coat layer preferably comprises a polyurethane resin having about 50 to about 65 % by weight of rigid segments and about 35 to about 50 % by weight of flexible segments. The rigid segments are derived from diisocyanates and aliphatic and/or cycloaliphatic chain extenders, and the flexible segments are derived from polymeric compounds having at least two active hydrogen atoms and having weight average molecular weights ranging from about 400 to about 4000.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to road surface marking 
tapes for use on roadway pavements to provide a traffic 
regulating line and/or other traffic information data 
thereon. More particularly, this invention relates to 
a new and improved tape having improved mechanical 
characteristics and being particularly suitable for 
heavy traffic conditions. The art of marking road surfaces is widely known. 
Pavement markings, most commonly traffic lines, can be 
painted on the road surface, or formed thereon by 
applying molten material thereto, or provided thereon 
by applying and adhesively securing manufactured 
marking tapes. The formed or applied traffic lines or other 
markings thereafter form a part of the road surface and 
are correspondingly subjected to the wear and 
destructive action of traffic. A continuing goal in the pavement marking industry 
is to find economical products from which to form 
traffic control stripes having a longer useful life 
than the commonly used painted stripes. The inability 
to achieve this goal is in part signified by the 
variety of products presently used to form stripes on a 
roadway. One class of products comprises epoxy resin-based 
paints. These products have a longer life than some 
other paints, but nevertheless have achieved only a 
small usage, probably because the epoxy resin cures 
slowly, necessitating elaborate and expensive 
application procedures. Also, the applied lines tend 
to spall and crack, show little impact resistance, and 
discolor with age.  
 Thicker coatings, such as thermoplastic polymers 
extruded or sprayed while in a molten condition, have 
produced some increase in life because of the greater 
amount of material to be worn away. However, the 
increased amount of material also increases the cost of 
the markings, and both expensive equipment and 
uncomfortable procedures are required to apply them. 
Also, the high profile of these markings can be 
disturbing to passing traffic, and the lines are 
especially susceptible to removal by snowplow blades. 
The markings will also spall, especially when applied 
to concrete, apparently because of the mismatch of 
thermal expansion characteristics between the rigid, 
thick markings and the concrete. Road markings consisting of preformed tape or 
strip materials are well known in the art to be 
advantageous in comparison to the conventional traffic 
markings described above. The preformed marking tapes 
are typically formed from a composite structure 
comprising a support base of a calendered rubber 
compo
