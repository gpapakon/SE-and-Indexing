<ABSTRACT>
A net diagram routing method for routing connecting lines between 
modes of a net diagram that comprises several regions each including a 

row or column of modes by determining a virtual routing length for each 
of a plurality of lines that are routed to pass through the same routing 

path.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a system for
automatically drawing net diagrams including a logic
diagram, a process diagram, a relational tree diagram,
a layout of a printed circuit board, and in
particular, to a schematic generating method of
automatically generating net diagram or logic circuit
diagram and a schematic generator or system using the
method suitable for generating a logic diagram, a
functional diagram, or a circuit diagram in which
signal flows are easily traceable based on circuit
parts such as circuit elements and constituent
circuits and connective information about connections
therebetween.For the conventional schematic generator, various
proposals have been presented. For example, articles
of such proposals have been described in the JP-A-61-204775,
"A Method of Generating a Logic Diagram" in
the Technical Report CAS84-134 published in 1984 from
the Institute of Electronics and Communication
Engineers of japan, "A Visibly-Oriented Construction
System for Logic Diagrams", Systems and Computers in
Japan, Vol 17 No 7, published in 1986, JP-A-60-205672, 
and JP-A-60-176177.In an ordinary schematic generator, an entire
logic circuit is subdivided through a logic division
such that for each subdivided portion, arrangement of
diagram drawing symbols of respective circuit parts
and the like are determined in the subdivided
constituent circuit 
through an automatic placement or placement. Routings
between the circuit parts are determined through an
automatic routing. In another ordinary schematic
generator, the circuit parts are arranged so as to be
thereafter divided, thereby generating a logic circuit
diagram. These methods produces a clear diagram primarily
by subdividing a logic circuit diagram in an effective
fashion, by employing a hierarchic representation of the
logic circuit diagram, or by using properties of
particular circuit parts other than the connective
relationships between the circuit parts.Moreover, conventionally, according to a method
of arranging circuit parts of a logical circuit diagram in
the schematic generating method, locations in which
drawing symbols are allocatable are limited to positions
defined by assuming a checkerboard or grid on the
objective diagram. The placements are then sequentially
determined beginning from an end of the diagram in a fixed
direction (for example, from an output side to an input
side or in a reverse direction thereto) according to the
connective relationships between the drawings symbols
(namely, between the circuit parts). In a

<CLAIMS>
A method of automatically routing connection
lines between nodes of a graph based diagram

representing a technical system, said diagram
comprising a plurality of regions each including a

column or row of nodes, said method being adapted to
routing said connection lines of said regions

sequentially and comprising

a first step of determining a routing path for
each connection line in dependence upon the positional

relationship between both edge nodes of said
connection line, each edge node being a node at the

start edge or the end edge of said connection line,
and
a second step (15) of routing parts of said
connection lines
said method being characterized by said second
step including
determining (261) virtual routing lengths of line
segments of a plurality of connecting lines routed to

pass through a same routing path, the computation of
each virtual routing length being based on positions

of two line bending points of each part of said
connection lines in the respective region, and each 

line segment being a segment of the respective
connection line between its two bending points, and
determining (262, 263) coordinates of said line
segments of said connection lines in a direction

perpendicular to said line segments, in order of said
virtual routing lengths.
A method according to claim 1, wherein said
second step (15) further includes


routing (242 to 246) parts of said connection
lines according to a routing sequence predetermined

for routing patterns (251 to 255), each pattern being
determined according to a start position and an end

position of the respective part of said connection
lines.
A method according to claim 1 or claim 2, wherein
said first step comprises


predetermined shapes and locations of routing

paths for positional relationships of start edge nodes
and end edge nodes of said connection lines, whereby

routing paths of said connection lines are
automatically/mechanically determined.
