<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a process for producing a 
compound of the general name Tizanidine, i.e., 5-chloro-4-[(2-imidazoline-2-yl)amino]-2,1,3-benzothiadiazole. 
Tizanidine, particularly Tizanidine hydrochloride, is a 
clinically important medicament as a tonus lenitive. Swiss Patent No. 579565 and US-A-3,843,668 describe that 2,1,3-benzothiadiazole 
derivatives including Tizanidine can be 
produced by reaction of ethylenediamine with a synthetic 
intermediate of one of the following formulae: 
 
wherein R1, R2 and R3 independently represent hydrogen, 
halogen, an alkyl, alkoxy, nitro or hydroxy group, R4 
represents a thio, amine or oxy group, X and Z 
independently represent a halogen atom, a thio, amine or 
oxy group. However, the synthetic intermediates (a), (b) 
and (c) used in the prior process are difficult to 
obtain, and the use of highly poisonous thiophosgene is 
unavoidable in some cases. In addition, the process of 
making the compound of formula I by reaction of these  
 
synthetic intermediates with ethylenediamine is 
cumbersome in operation and is likely to cause side 
reactions, thus bringing about a tendency towards the 
lowering of yield. Under these circumstances, it is still desired 
to provide a process as an industrial process of making 
the compound of formula I in high yield from inexpensive 
starting materials and in simple procedures. Hence, the 
object of the present invention is to provide a process 
for making the object compound Tizanidine of formula I, 
i.e., 5-chloro-4-[(2-imidazoline-2-yl)amino]-2,1,3-benzothiadiazole 
in high yield in simple reaction 
procedures. In order to achieve the above object, the 
present inventors made extensive research on a process 
for making the compound of formula I in high yield in 
simple reaction procedures using starting materials or 
reaction agents available at lower costs. As a result, 
the present inventors found that the compound of formula 
I can be produced in extremely high yield by allowing a 
precursor of the above compounds (a), (b) and (c), i.e. 
5-chloro-4-amino-2,1,3-benzothiadiazole, to react with a 
certain N-substituted-imidazolone. According to the present invention, there is 
provided a process of producing 5-chloro-4-[(2-imidazoline-2-yl)amino]-2,1,3-benzothiadiazole 
of formula I: 
 
which process comprises:  
 
(A) reacting the compound of formula (II): 
 
with a compound of formula (III): 
 
wherein R is a group selected from C1-C4 alkyl, C3-C7 
cycloalkyl, phenyl, aryl-C1-C3 alkyl and C1-C4 alkyloxy,
