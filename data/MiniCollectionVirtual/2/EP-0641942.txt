<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a push fastener for the releasable joining of two elements (1, 2), having a housing (6) which is to be guided through mutually aligned holes (3, 4) in the elements (1, 2) to be joined and is supported on the first element (1) by its head, having arresting means (8) which exhibit arresting protrusions (7) and are intended for radial engagement behind the second element (2), and having a push button (9) which is received in an axial displaceable manner in the housing (6) and is intended for releasing the arresting means (8), the arresting protrusions (7) being arranged on elastically radially pivotable arresting legs (10) of the housing (6) and/or of a housing insert (11), the arresting legs (10) exhibiting outer wedge surfaces (12) which are inclined with respect to the housing end and are intended for the introduction of the housing (6) into the holes (3, 4) of the elements (1, 2), the arresting legs (10) exhibiting oblique surfaces (14) which are inclined towards the housing head (5) and are intended for interaction with a triggering section (13) of the push button (9), and the push button (9), upon actuation, acting on the oblique surfaces (14) by means of the triggering section (13) in order to press the arresting legs (10) radially inwards in an elastically yielding manner and thus to bring the arresting protrusions (7) out of engagement with the second element (2).

Push fastener for releasable joining of two elements (1, 2), with a
housing (6) supported on the head side on the first element (1) and

guiding the elements to be joined (1, 2) by holes aligned with each
other (3,4), with locking means (8) with locking projections (7)

arranged on elastic radially locking legs, where the said means attach
the second element (2) to the first element in the locking position,

and with a push button (9) held axially displaceably in the housing (6)
for releasing the locking means (8), where the locking legs (10) have

external wedge surfaces (12) angled towards the housing end for the
insertion of the housing (6) in the holes (3,4) in the elements (1, 2),

characterized in that the locking legs (10) are arranged on the housing
(6) or a housing insert (11), that the locking legs (10) have certain

inclined surfaces (14) angled towards the housing head (5) to cooperate
with a release section (13) of the push button (9), and that the push

button (9), on operation with the release section (13), acts on the
inclined surfaces (14) in order to press the locking legs (10) inwards

with an elastic radial movement and thus bring the locking projections
(7) out of their locking position.
Push fastener according to claim 1, characterized in that allocated to
the housing (6) is a spring elastic element (15) for clamping the

second element (2) against the first element (1) by means of the
locking projections (7).
Push fastener according to claim 1 or 2, characterized in that the push
button (9) engages in the housing (6) and is guided axially in this in

a twist-free manner.
Push fastener according to any of claims 1 to 3, characterized in that
the push button (9) is supported on a return spring (17) against the

housing (6) or housing insert (11).
Push fastener according to one or more of the previous claims,
characterized in that the push button (9) is pressed with a shoulder

(18) on the housing head side against an inner counter shoulder (19) or
a stop (29) of the housing (6) in the closing direction by means of the

return spring (17) which rests on the housing (6) directly or via a 
spring plate (16) .
Push fastener according to one or more of the previous claims,
characterized in that the locking legs (10) are part of the housing

insert (11) and the locking legs (10) with their locking projections
(7) protrude in the locking position out of the housing (6) through

openings (20) of the side wall (21) of the housing (6).
Push fastener according to claim 6, characterized in that the locking
legs (10) project from a floor section (30) of the housing insert (11)

in the direction of the housing head (5) or in the direction of the
housing end (31).
Push fastener according to claim 6 or 7, characterized in that the
peripheral area of the openings (20) of the side wall (21) of the

housing (6) on the housing head side serves as a stop for the locking
legs (10) in the expanded locking position.
Push fastener according to one or more of the previous claims,
characterized in that the spring elastic element (15) formed for

example as a rubber buffer sits on the outer periphery of the side wall
(21) of the housing (6), and lies on the housing head side on a ring

shoulder (22) of the housing (6) and on the first element (1).
Push fastener according to one or more of the previous claims,
characterized in that the housing end (31) is equipped with insertion

slopes (23).
Push fastener according to one or more of the previous claims,
characterized in that the locking projections (7) engage behind the

second element (2) in the locking position.
Push fastener according to one or more of the previous claims,
characterized in that the housing (6) and/or the housing insert (11)

and/or the push button (9) consist of plastic.
