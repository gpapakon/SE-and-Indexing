<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention concerns antiperspirant salts 
containing an aluminum species, a zirconium species and an 
amino acid that have superior efficacy in view of the low 
molecular weight distribution of the zirconium species, which 
molecular weight distribution is controlled by proper 
selection and regulation of the processing conditions used in 
preparing the antiperspirant salt. The present invention is 
especially related to a high efficacy antiperspirant salt 
containing the low molecular weight zirconium species of the 
present invention, in admixture with an activated aluminum 
chloro species and an amino acid. The preparation of aluminum- and zirconium-based 
antiperspirant materials generally involves combining 
compounds of these metals with an amino acid under suitable 
conditions. Such materials are generally referred to as ZAG 
complexes and have often been shown to be chemically distinct 
species having antiperspirant efficacy, i.e., the inhibition 
of perspiration when applied to human skin, especially the 
axilla.  In recent years various workers have attempted to 
enhance efficacy of ZAG salts by preparing such salts that 
contain an activated aluminum chlorohydrex polymeric salt 
(ACH) in which a large amount of the Al Kd 0.4 species 
(≧ 50%) is present. These so-called activated ZAG salts 
were thought to be superior to normal ZAG salts due to the 
increased Al Kd 0.4 content as is the case for activated ACH 
compared to normal ACH. We have found, however, that 
activated ZAG salts are not necessarily more efficacious than 
normal ZAG salts and in fact can be less efficacious than 
normal ZAG salts. In U.S. Patent 4,775,528 to Callaghan et al, an 
antiperspirant composition is produced by heating a 2 to 18% 
aqueous solution of aluminum chlorhydroxide to at least 50°C, 
mixing zirconyl hydroxychloride with the solution before, 
during or after heating, continuing heating of the aqueous 
mixture until prescribed characterizations are achieved, 
and thereafter rapidly drying the heated aqueous mixture to 
obtain a solid material having an Al:Zr atomic ratio of from 
6:1 to 1:1 and also having peak 4 and peak 3 Al chromatograph 
peaks, the ratio of peak 4 to peak 3 being at least 2:1. 
Patentees specify in Claim 1 that the zirconyl hydroxychloride 
be mixed with the aluminum chlorhydroxide solution  
 
before the solution loses all of its water, i.e., "before 
completion of ... drying". The teachings of Callaghan, et al are directed to 
improvements to be achieved via optimizing the
