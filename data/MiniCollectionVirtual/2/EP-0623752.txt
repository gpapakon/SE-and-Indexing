<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to the inlet edges (suction edges) of blades of centrifugal-pump impellers which deliver solids-containing media. In the plane of the central blade face there is, upstream of the inlet edges of the blades, a very flat transition from the impeller backdisks to the inlet edges of the blades.

<CLAIMS>
Centrifugal pump impeller of enclosed type of
construction, having blades arranged between shroud

plates, for the delivery of liquids containing solids,
transition radii being arranged between the blades and

shroud plates, and the blades at the start of the blade
being constructed without a thickened portion of the

incident-flow blade edges, characterized in that the
transitions between the blades (3) and the impeller

shroud plates (4, 5) are drawn forward on the blades (3)
in extension of the mean blade area (11) beyond the

incident-flow blade edges (6) in such a way that a gentle
slope is effected from the impeller shroud plates (4, 5)

to the start (6) of the blades, and in that the transitions
from the impeller shroud plates (4, 5) to the

drawn-forward start (6) of the blades are effected as
curves or straight lines having initial gradients of 0째

up to a maximum of 30째.
Centrifugal pump impeller according to Claim 1,
characterized in that the curved transition into the

start (6) of the blades has a radius (R) which is equal
to or greater than 2.5 times the initial thickness (D) of

the blades (3).
Centrifugal pump impeller according to Claim 1 or
2, characterized in that the cross-section between the

shroud plates (4, 5) of the impeller (2) and the start
(6) of the blades narrows in a nozzle shape.
Centrifugal pump impeller according to Claim 3,
characterized in that the depth of material removal (12)

at the impeller shroud plates (4, 5) is at least twice as 
great as the initial thickness (D) of the blades (3).
Method of producing a centrifugal pump impeller
of enclosed type of construction, having blades arranged

between shroud plates, for the delivery of liquids
containing solids, transition radii being arranged

between the blades and shroud plates, characterized in
that, by material-accumulating (8, 9) and/or material-removing

(12) measures in extension of the mean blade
areas (11) beyond the incident-flow blade edges (6),

transitions are formed between the blades (3) and the
impeller shroud plates (4, 5) in such a way that a gentle

slope is effected from the impeller shroud plates (4, 5)

to the start (6) of the blades, and in that the transitions
of the drawn-forward start (6) of the blades from

the impeller shroud plates (4, 5) to the blades (3) are
designed as curves or straight lines having gradients of

0째 up to a maximum of 30째.
