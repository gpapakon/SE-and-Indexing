<ABSTRACT>
Light components are radiated into a blood vessel, 
from light-emitting diodes (17, 18) for emitting light 

components having different wavelengths, through an 
optical fiber. Light components reflected by the blood 

upon radiation into the blood vessel are received by a 
photo transistor (19) to detect their reflected light 

intensities. For example, a minimum value of the 
reflected light intensity of the light component from 

the light-emitting diode (18) is obtained from the 
reflected light intensities detected within a 

predetermined period of time. A measurement value is 
calculated using this minimum value and a minimum value 

of the reflected light intensity of the light component 
from the corresponding light-emitting diode (17).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a measuring 
apparatus and, more particularly, to a measuring 
apparatus for radiating light in blood to measure e.g., 
the oxygen saturation of the blood in accordance with a 
reflected light intensity. In recent years, a system or apparatus has been 
developed in which light is radiated in blood through 
an optical fiber incorporated in a cardiac catheter, 
and the intensity of a light component of all the 
radiated light component, which is reflected by the 
blood, is measured to monitor the oxygen saturation 
(SVO₂) of a mixed venous blood in accordance with the 
light-absorbing characteristics of hemoglobin. This 
oxygen saturation monitor for the mixed venous blood 
plays an important role in detecting and alarming an 
abrupt change in operating states of circulatory organs 
in patient's management upon a direct vision 
intracardiac operation. In addition, this oxygen 
saturation monitor is useful in evaluating a certain 
load on a living body, such as drug administration.  When the oxygen saturation is to be measured using 
such a system or apparatus, various factors except for 
the oxygen saturation in blood are considered as 
factors for varying the intensity of light reflected by 
blood. It is important to suppress the influences of 
these factors. Some factors may be based on a 
measuring system, but variation factors derived from a 
living system are more important. It is, therefore, 
essential to correct measurement data varied by these 
variation factors in development of a monitor system. A system for measuring and monitoring the oxygen 
saturation will be exemplified. To continuously 
monitor the oxygen saturation in human blood, light 
components having two specific wavelengths are radiated 
in blood using a catheter or the like, and back-scattered 
light components (reflected light components) 
from the blood are detected. The specific wavelengths 
here are defined as a wavelength (isosbestic 
wavelength: 805 nm) at which the absorbency of 
oxyhemoglobin is equal to that of reduced hemoglobin 
and a wavelength (660 nm) at which a difference between 
the absorbencies thereof becomes large. An intensity 
signal of reflected light having a wavelength of 805 nm 
as the isosbestic wavelength rarely depends on the 
oxygen saturation. However, an intensity signal of 
reflected light having the wavelength of 660 nm greatly  
 
changes depending on the oxygen saturation. These two 
signals are compared to obtain the oxygen saturation of 
blood. An equation for
