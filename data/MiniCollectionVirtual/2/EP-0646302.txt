<ABSTRACT>
A packet transmission system (100) for reducing request traffic contention and the likelihood of resource misallocation includes a communications controller (110) and a plurality of remote requesting units (112) requesting packet transmission services. In response to receipt of a request (302), the controller (110) transmits a grant (306) to a requesting unit (112) when packet transmission resources (304 and 310) are available or a request acknowledgment (306) when packet transmission resources (304 and 310) are unavailable. Each remote unit (112) comprises apparatus structure and method steps for transmitting requests (302) to the controller (110) and starting a first timer having an interval (T) determined as a function of a number (Q) of outstanding requests (302). Upon receipt of an acknowledgment (306), the remote unit (112) starts a second timer having an interval (T1) longer than the inverval (T). Upon expiration of either the first timer or the second timer, the remote unit (112) will then and only then transmit a duplicate request (302). By limiting the number of duplicate requests transmitted by a remote unit (112), the present invention operates to reduce request traffic contention and the likelihood of resource misallocation.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention is directed to a packet transmission
system. In particular, this invention relates to a
method and apparatus for reducing request traffic
contention and ultimately the likelihood of resource
misallocation within a packet transmission system.Packet transmission service has been in use for
some time and has traditionally been employed within
communication systems such as wireless and wire line
voice and/or data communications. Packet transmission
service has also been used in association with digital
communication systems which permit the efficient
allocation of system resources via any of the well known
access schemes, such as, for example, Time Division
Multiple Access (TDMA), Frequency Division Multiple
Access (FDMA), Code Division Multiple Access (CDMA) or
any combination thereof. As will be appreciated, system
resources may comprise radio frequency spectrum divided
into communication channels to facilitate the
transmission of user information. In a digital packet transmission system, there are
several access procedures a requesting unit can initiate
when attempting to obtain and utilize system resources.
These access procedures inform the system which type of
operation a requesting unit is attempting to perform.
Such operations include but are not limited to, call
origination, location reporting, registration and page
response.The typical access procedure may be summarized as
follows. A requesting unit transmits a system access
request (request) over a request channel to a
communications controller, starts a retry timer, and
awaits a bandwidth grant message from the controller,
informing the unit when and which channel is available
for use. If the communications controller fails to
respond to the request before the retry timer expires,
the requesting unit will reissue the request (duplicate
request). This procedure will continue until the
requesting unit either receives a valid assignment of a
resource (bandwidth grant), reaches a maximum number of
retries, or a packet lifetime timer expires, informing
the requesting unit to cease.In a TDMA system, several requests may be received
by the controller per TDMA frame. These requests are
stored in memory (queued) until time slots available to
satisfy the requests are allocated. For identification
purposes, each requesting unit's request contains
identification information. Therefore, a communications
controller receives specific information with which to
distinguish one unit's access request from that of
another. Requests, however,

contention and TDM resource misallocation for use in a TDMA

packet transmission system wherein a plurality of remote
units (114) request TDM resources from a communications

controller (110) by transmitting multiple requests to said
controller (110), the method for reducing the likelihood of

request traffic contention and TDM resource misallocation

interval determined as a function of a number of non-acknowledged
requests issued by said remote unit;
