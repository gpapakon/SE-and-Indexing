<ABSTRACT>
A rotary hammer is provided which comprises a tool holder (2) and an air
cushion hammering mechanism which comprises a cylinder (8') having one end (8)

that is connected to the tool holder, a piston (9), a ram (10) and a beat piece (21)
slidably located in the cylinder so that reciprocation of the piston in the cylinder will

cause the ram to reciprocate in the cylinder and thus cause the beat piece to hit a bit
located in the tool holder. The ram (10) has an annular recess (31) in its peripheral

surface at the end thereof nearest the piston (9), in which recess is located an annular
seal (30). The annular seal has an annular seating flap (36) lying on the radially

outwardly directed surface of the recess and an annular sealing flap (38) that is joined
to the seating flap and extends between the radially outwardly directed surface of the

recess and the inner wall of the cylinder (8').

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to rotary hammers, and, in particular to hammers that incorporate an air cushion hammering mechanism.Such hammers will normally include a tool holder that can hold a hammer bit or chisel bit for acting on a workpiece, and an air cushion hammering mechanism which comprises a piston and a beat piece that are slidably located in a cylinder so that reciprocation of the piston in the cylinder will cause the beat piece to hit a bit located in the tool holder. Such hammers may, however, be employed in more than one mode. For example a hammer may be capable of being employed in a hammer only or so-called "chiselling" mode in which the piston reciprocates within the cylinder in order to cause the beat piece to hit the bit without any rotation of the tool, or alternatively a drilling only mode in which the cylinder may form part of a spindle connected to the tool holder and is caused to rotate about the piston, thereby causing the bit inserted in the tool holder to rotate. The hammer may also be capable of being employed in a combination rotary hammer mode in which the piston reciprocates within the cylinder causing the beat piece to hit the bit while at the same time the cylinder rotates about the axis of the piston, thereby causing the bit to rotate.As an example, one such hammer is described in WO 98/47670. This hammer has a drive motor that is arranged with its armature shaft at right angles to the axis of the hammer spindle, and has a single switching mechanism that can switch the hammer between pure rotation, pure chiselling and combination rotation and chiselling modes. The armature shaft of an electric motor is coupled to a drive shaft on which is mounted one end of crank arm that causes the piston to reciprocate within a horizontally oriented cylinder when the drive shaft rotates. The piston is linked to a ram also located in the cylinder by means of an air gap so that reciprocation of the piston causes the ram to reciprocate and to hit a beat piece located forward of the ram, thereby causing the beat piece to impact the rear end of the bit that is inserted in the tool holder. The mode of operation may be changed by means of a switch into a rotary mode in which the piston crank is decoupled from the drive shaft, and instead the cylinder is caused to rotate about the piston, ram and beat piece, thereby causing the bit to rotate in the tool holder. By moving the switch to a third position, the piston can be caused to reciprocate while the cylinder rotates, thereby putting the bit

<CLAIMS>
A rotary hammer which comprises:

(a) a tool holder (2); and
(b) an air cushion hammering mechanism which comprises a cylinder (8') having one end (8) that is connected to the tool holder, a piston (9), a ram (10) and a beat piece (21) slidably located in the cylinder so that reciprocation of the piston in the cylinder will cause the ram to reciprocate in the cylinder and thus cause the beat piece to hit a bit, when located in the tool holder;

wherein the ram (10) has an annular recess (31) in its peripheral surface at the end thereof nearest the piston (9), in which recess is located an annular seal (30), the annular seal having an annular seating flap (36) lying on the radially outwardly directed surface of the recess and an annular sealing flap (38) that is joined to the seating flap and extends between the radially outwardly directed surface of the recess and the inner wall of the cylinder (8');
characterised in that
 the annular sealing flap (38) extends between the radially outwardly directed surface of the recess (31) and the inner wall of the cylinder (8') at an acute angle to the seating flap (36).
A hammer as claimed in claim 1, 
characterised in that
 the annular seating flap (36) extends axially along the ram approximately by the same distance as the sealing flap (38).
A hammer as claimed in claim 1 or 2, 
characterised in that
 the sealing flap (38) has sufficient resistance to deformation to enable it to withstand an overpressure of 1 bar at the forward end of the hammer.
A hammer as claimed in any one of claims 1 to 3, 
characterised in that
 the piston (9) has a face that is oriented toward the ram (10) and which has a shape that complements the profile of the end of the ram that is directed toward the piston.
A hammer as claimed in claim 4, 
characterised in that
 the piston (9) has a ridge (32) that extends around the periphery of the face that is directed toward the ram (10), and which can extend into the recess (31) in the ram when the piston and the ram reach the point of closest approach.

characterised in that
 the annular seal (30) is formed from polytetrafluoroethylene.
A hammer as claimed in any one of claims 1 to 6,
