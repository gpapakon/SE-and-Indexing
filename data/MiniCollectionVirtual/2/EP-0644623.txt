<ABSTRACT>
A coupling device interconnects a car connector BC 
and a charger connector SC positively under a small force 

to charge a battery in an electric car. After bringing 
housings 1 and 2 of both connectors BC and SC, when an 

operation lever 8 together with a grip 32 are grasped, 
an engaging projection 229 pushes a rear end of a coupling 

groove 228 so that a coupling plate 10 is moved from an 
advanced position to a retracted position. During a 

former movement of the plates 10, a projection 232 rids 
on an inner side from a rear edge of an escape groove 233 

so that distal ends of the coupling plates 10 are closed. 
Consequently, windows 231 in the plates receive projections 

209 on the housing of the car connector BC. The housing 2 
of the charger connector SC together with a body 3 are 

drawn into the housing 1 during a latter movement of the 
plates, thereby completely interconnecting both connectors 

BC and SC. When the lever 8 returns to an opening position, 
the coupling plate 10 is backed from the retracted position 

to return the housing 2 together with the body 3 and the 
distal end of the coupling plates 10 are widened to detach 

the housing 1. When the body 3 is pulled, both connectors 
BC and SC are separated.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to charging connector assembly
comprising a coupling device for an electric car and more
particularly to a coupling device which can be operated
under a relatively small force.An electric car or automobile will be put to
practical use in a near future. At that time, it will
be impossible to avoid a problem of charging a battery
in the electric car. In particular, a charging connector
assembly will be one of important problems to be discussed.
The charging connector assembly comprises a car connector
connected to a battery in the electric car and a charger
connector connected to a charger through a cable.However, it is necessary to apply a large force to
the charging connector in order to positively interconnect
terminals in each connector. If a substantial load is
caused due to a friction resistance between the connectors
during coupling, this may be mistaken for complete coupling.
In the case of conducting a charging current through the
assembly in the incomplete coupling state, the terminals
will generate heat or sparks therebetween when both
connectors are displaced.It is also desired to start conducting after both
connectors of the assembly have been completely coupled.One of the problems in the charging connector
assembly is to start a charging operation in the incomplete
coupling state of the connectors. If this is done, an
abnormal heat may be caused in the assembly, oxidation due
to sparks may be caused on the terminals in the assembly.
or the assembly will give an operator any electrical shock.There is a conventional charging connector in which
one connector is provided on an outer periphery of an end
with a male thread and the other connector is provided on 
an outer periphery with a rotatable ring which has a female
thread adapted to be engaged with the male thread.The connectors are electrically interconnected by
opposing the connectors with each other and rotating the
rotatable ring so as to mate the male and female threads.
The connectors are electrically disconnected from each
other by turning the rotatable ring in a reverse direction.In the conventional charging connector assembly mentioned
above, the male and female threads are mated with each
other by rotation of the rotatable ring to couple both
connectors. However, coupling of thread engagement can
be easily released.In comparison with the car connector secured to
the car, the charger connector is connected to the charger
through the cable.The charging connector assembly is a relatively large
size since a
