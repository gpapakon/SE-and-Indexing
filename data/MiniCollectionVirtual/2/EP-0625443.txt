<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a carrying case having a basic structure which is less deep than it is wide or high and which can be closed with a lid. The object of the invention is to design carrying cases in a manner such that they can be used as seat elements, enlarging their range of intended uses. This object is achieved by virtue of the fact that a wide outer surface bearing against one wide side of the basic structure is designed as the seat surface and that the basic structure has a dimensional stability up to a weight of at least 360 N acting on the seat surface.

in that one broad outer surface, located on the 

broad side of the base body (3), is designed as 
the seating surface (4) of a child's car seat,
 
in that the base body (3) displays dimensional 

stability up to a weight of at least 360 N acting 
on the seating surface (4),
 
in that the base body (3) forms the body of the 

child's car seat when placed on the seat of a 
motor vehicle, and
 
in that arms (25), attached in pivoting fashion 

to the narrow outer sides forming the depth of 
the combined carrying case and seat (1), prevent 

the combined carrying case and seat (1) from 
slipping in the direction of travel.  

 
Combined carrying case and seat as per Claim 1, 

characterised in that
 the 
lid (6) is designed in such a way that, when

body (3), enhancing the stability of the base 

body (3). 
Combined carrying case and seat as per Claim 1 
or 2, 
characterised in that
 
a first locking element (9.1), which can be engaged 

in a second locking element (9.2) on the

(22) opposite to the broad outer surface designed 
as the seating surface (4). 
Combined carrying case and seat as per Claims 1 
to 3, 
characterised in that
 
the lid (6) is connected to the base body (3) in 

hinge-like fashion. 
Combined carrying case and seat as per one of 
the Claims 1 to 4, 
characterised in that
 
the base body (3) is covered by a 

sleeve (2).

the Claims 1 to 5, 
characterised in that
 
the base body (3) can be inserted 

into a sleeve. 
Combined carrying case and seat as per Claim 6, 

characterised in that
 the 
sleeve can be connected to the base body (3), 

with only the sleeve assuming the outward-acting  
 

functions of the base body. 
Combined carrying case and seat as per one of 
the Claims 1 to 7, 
characterised in that
 
the broad outer side designed as 

the seating surface (4) is provided with edge 
beads (11). 
Combined carrying case and seat as per one of 
the Claims 1 to 8, 
characterised in that
 
the broad outer surface designed 

as the seating surface (4) is padded. 
Combined carrying case and seat as per one of 
the Claims 1 to 9, 
characterised in that
 
the broad outer surface designed 

as the seating surface (4) can be connected to a 
separate padded surface. 
Combined carrying case and seat as per Claim 10, 

characterised in that
 the 
broad surface designed as the seating surface 

(4) is provided with Velcro fasteners which can 
be connected to corresponding Velcro fasteners 

on the rear of the separate padded surface. 
Combined carrying case and seat as per one of 
the Claims 1 to 11, 
characterised in that
 
straps (12) are located on the 

combined carrying case and seat (1) in such a 
way that the combined carrying case and seat can 

be carried on the back, with the outer surface, 
designed as the seating surface (4), lying 

against the back of the person carrying it.  

 
Combined carrying case and seat as per Claim 12, 

characterised in that
 the 
straps (12) consist of a shoulder pad (13) and a 

carrying strap (14) with a tab (15) and a clamping 
element (16) fastened to it, and that the 

shoulder pad (13) and the carrying strap (14) 
are connected to each other in such a way that 

the straps (12) can be quickly opened and flexibly 
adjusted. 
Combined carrying case and seat as per one of 
the Claims 1 to 13, 
characterised in that
 
a handle (24) is fixed to the lid 

(6) in fold-away fashion. 
Combined carrying case and seat as per one of 
the Claims 1 to 14, 
characterised in that
 
reflective surfaces (5) are 

located on the broad outer surface opposite the 
seating surface (4) and/or on the narrow outer 

sides forming the depth of the combined carrying 
case and seat (1). 
Combined carrying case and seat as per one of 
the Claims 1 to 15, 
characterised in that,
 
when used as a child's car seat, 

the arms (25) can be pivoted in the direction of 
the seating surface (4) in such a way that they 

project beyond the plane of the seating surface 
(4) and are connected in the vicinity of the lid 

or bottom end of the outer sides in such a way 
that, when used as a child's car seat, they are 

positioned on the side facing the back rest of 
the seat of the motor vehicle.
