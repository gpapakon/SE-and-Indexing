<DESCRIPTION>
 "Compositions of Platelet Activating Factor Antagonists and Methods of Treating Interleukin-2 Induced Lung Injury Therewith"This invention relates to a method of treating interleukin-2 induced lung injury in a mammal, including a human, in need thereof which comprises administering to such mammal an effective amount of a platelet-activating factor antagonist. Background of the InventionHuman recombinant Interleukin-2 (IL-2) has been shown to mediate tumor regression in animals (Ettinghausen, S.E. et al. Cancer Res. Af.:2784-2792 (1987)) and Humans (Rosenberg, S.A. et al. N. Enσ. . Meri. 3 3.1 as (1985)) and is currently under investigation as a new treatment modality for patients with advanced metastatic cancer (Rosenberg, S.A. et al. N. Eng. J. Med. 2 £:889 (1987) ) .The systemic use of IL-2 has, however, also been associated with disorders such as, microvascular injury and pulmonary adema (Clausner, F.L. et al. J. Appl. . Physio] . £1:1030-1037 (1988) and Rosenstein, M. JL. Immunol. 137:1735-1742 (1986)) (hereinafter "lung injury") . The acute pulmonary toxicity associated with IL-2 infusion has been proposed to result from Lymphocyte activation (Anderson, T.D. et al. Lab. Tnvss . 59:598-612 (1988), Damle, N.K. et al. JL. 

Trπnimol . 142:2660-2659 (1989) and Damle U.K. et al. J Tτnπmno.1. 138:1779-1785 (1987)), the production of inflammatory mediators such as interleukin-1 (IL-1) Numerof, R.P. et al. «T. Immunol 141:4250-4257 (1988)) or tumor Necrosis Factor-cc (Helsopr H.E. et al. Blood1A:1374-1380 (1989) and Nedwin, G.E. et al. J. T mnnol. l__5_:2492-2496 (1985) and from the IL-2 induced activation of Humoral systems such as the complement cascade (Thijs, L.G. ,T. Immunol. 144:2419-2424 (1990)) . The actual mechanis (s) of IL-2-induced lung injury is presently unknown.PAF (platelet activating factor) is phospholipid acetyl-glyceryl-ether-phosphoryl-choline (AGEPC) which is known as a potent lipid mediator released by animal and human proinflammatory cells. These cells include mainly basophilic and neutrophilic granulocytes, macrophages (from blood and tissue) and thrombocytes which are involved in in lammatory reactions.Compounds which inhibit PAF are reported to be of potential value in the treatment, of a variety of conditions including allergic,- inflammatory and hypersecretory conditions such as asthma, arthritis, rhinitis, bronchitis and urticaria, the treatment of circulatory shock, gastric, ulceration, psoriasis and cardiovascular conditions, including angina, thrombosis and stroke, (WO
