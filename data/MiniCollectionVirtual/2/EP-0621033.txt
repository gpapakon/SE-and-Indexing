<ABSTRACT>
Antibiotic active aqueous composition especially for 
application by injection in the veterinary science containing as 

the active antibiotic a complex of oxytetracycline and magnesium 
and polyvinylpyrrolidone as stabilisator and such a percentage of 

ethanolamine that the pH of the composition has a value from 
7.0 - 9.5 and as a solvent for the antibiotic active complex 

glycofurol.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to an antibiotic active aqueous 
composition, especially for use by injection in the veterinary 
science. Many compositions have been proposed for the above 
mentioned use, having widely different compositions. These 
compositions must fulfil many conditions, among which of course, 
first should be mentioned that in the treatment of living beings, 
especially in the treatment of animals, no adverse effects should 
be encountered. A further condition is that they should be easily 
injectable and that when injecting them, no pain and little 
tissue irritation should be caused. Furthermore the liquid should 
be stable so that it can be stocked for a long time and that no 
dissociations or unwanted reactions take place. Furthermore a 
quick and almost complete absorption at the injection point 
preventing the forming of a residue is important. The European patent no. 0 096 942, describes an aqueous 
antibiotic preparation of the same kind which contains as the 
active antibiotic, a complex of Oxytetracycline and magnesium. To 
fulfil the above mentioned other conditions, at least to some 
extent, the composition according to this patent contains 
moreover a certain amount of polyvinylpyrrolidone and a certain 
amount of ethanolamine, preferably monoethanolamine, to bring the 
pH to a value between 6.0 and 9.5. As an antioxydant the 
composition may also contain sodiumformaldehydesulfoxylate. As the antibiotic active part i.e., the oxytetracyclinemagnesiumcomplex 
is very poorly soluble in water, the composition 
according to the above mentioned patent contains a certain amount 
of N-methylpyrrolidone in which the complex is well soluble. 
Moreover the N-methylpyrolidone also brings about an improvement 
of the stability of the composition. Although with the composition according to this European 
patent no. 0 096 942, good results have been achieved, there 
still exists the wish to increase the amount of the active 
complex as well as to improve the above indicated desirable 
properties of the composition. This is the aim of the invention.  An aqueous antibiotic active composition according to the 
invention, especially for use by injection in the veterinary 
science, contains as the active antibiotic a complex of 
oxytetracycline and magnesium as well as polyvinylpyrrolidone as 
a stabilisator and such a percentage of ethanolamine that the pH 
of the composition has a value of 7.0-9.5 and is characterized by 
the fact that the composition contains as solvent for the 
antibiotic active
