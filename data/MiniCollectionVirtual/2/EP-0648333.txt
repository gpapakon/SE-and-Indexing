<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a biosensor in which a carbohydrate or a
derivative thereof is used to generate a detectable signal via the specific binding of
a protein, a virus or a cell.Biosensors are characterised by a physical or chemical signal transducer, which
response is activated by a specific interaction between a biochemical structure
(which directly or indirectly has been bound to the transducer) and one or several
analytes.Biosensors are used to detect the analyte/analytes and in certain cases also for
quantification of the analyte/analytes.The advantages of the biosensor are that a physical or chemical transducer has
been made specific so that a general physical or chemical parameter (e.g.
temperature, pH, optical density) can be used for the detection of one specific
substance in a complex mixture of non-specific substances.The limitations of the biosensor are the specificity of the biochemical structure
bound to the transducer, the range of specificity and stability, and, that the
transducer signal has to be made independent of the background changes in the
parameter that the transducer is measuring. In Methods of Enzymology, volume
137, several articles are describing different aspects of biosensors.DE-A-3 617 763 discloses a method for analysing
antigens or antibodies contained in a sample, in which
method a specifically reactive substance is fixed to a
surface of a measuring light guide member.EP-A-0 215 669 describes an analytical device and
a method for analysis of biochemicals, microbes and cells
using a piezoelectric chrystal biosensor. Sugars are
bound to the surface of the devices.WO-A-90/01166 discloses an improved assay technique
which provides an enhanced signal-to-noise ratio and
enhances sensitivity. Inter alia, a method is disclosed
for assaying a liquid in a sample by use of an optical
sensor carrying receptors on its surface.US-A-5 082 99 discloses immobilisation of glycocompounds
and glycoconjugates onto solid supports for use as
biosensors.WO-A-92/12995 discloses a method for binding of
carbohydrates to a carrier via a spacer, in which the
spacer is non-glycosidically bound to the carbohydrate.WO-A-94/00763 is an Article 54(3) document and
discloses a method for determination of multiple immuno-complexes
on a biosensor surface using spectroscopy.According to the present invention there is provided
a biosensor containing at least one carbohydrate derivative
comprising a) a spacer, and b) a carbohydrate part,
which has biological activity or the ability to
