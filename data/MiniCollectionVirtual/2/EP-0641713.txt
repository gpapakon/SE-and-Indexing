<ABSTRACT>
A hygienic liquid dispensing system (10) having a cap (50) 
to close the opening of an inverted liquid container (15) 

is disclosed. The cap (50) has a lid portion (53) to 
overlie and sealingly close the opening and an annular 

skirt portion (55) extending axially away from the lid 
(53) to surround a portion of the container neck (51). 

The lid portion (53) is provided with an axially inwardly 
extending recess (60) including
 an outer sleeve (62) and 
an inner plug portion (70) integrally formed with a 

frangible connection (75) therebetween. A feed tube (45) 
is dimensioned for forcible insertion into the recess (60) 

for breaking the frangible connection (75) and separating 
the plug portion (70) from the sleeve (62) to permit the 

discharge of liquid from the container (15). A mounting 
apparatus (25) is also provided to fit on the upper 

portion (26) of a cabinet (20) and defines an annular ring 
(24) for supporting the inverted container (15) thereon 

which also defines a tapered entry portion (27) extending 
downwardly and inwardly from the annular ring (24) for 

receiving the inverted container (15) therein.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a hygienic cap for enclosing 
drinking water or other potable liquid within a substantially 
rigid liquid dispensing container during storage and 
transportation thereof and for cooperating with an upstanding 
feed tube to drain liquid from and admit replacement air into 
said container when inverted, said container having a 
substantially cylindrical neck defining a discharge opening, said 
cap including: a lid portion adapted to overlie and sealingly 
close said discharge opening and an annular skirt portion 
extending axially away from said lid portion and adapted to 
surround and engage an outer axial portion of said container 
neck, said lid portion having an axially inwardly extending 
recess formed therein including an annular sleeve portion located 
generally centrally in said lid portion and integrally connected 
thereto, said recess being closed and sealed by a closure 
disposed at the inner end of the annular sleeve portion, the 
closure being adapted to be opened upon the forcible insertion 
of said upstanding feed tube into said recess to drain liquid 
from and admit replacement air into said substantially rigid 
liquid dispensing container. The invention also relates to a hygienic liquid dispensing 
system comprising, in combination, a cap adapted to close the 
discharge opening in the neck of a substantially rigid drinking 
water or other potable liquid container, said cap having a lid 
portion adapted to overlie and sealingly close said discharge 
opening and an annular skirt portion extending axially away from 
said lid portion and adapted to surround and engage an outer  
 
axial portion of said container neck, said lid portion having an 
axially inwardly extending recess formed therein, said recess 
including an annular sleeve portion located generally centrally 
in said lid portion and integrally connected thereto, said recess 
being closed and sealed by a closure disposed at the inner end 
of the annular sleeve portion, and an upstanding feed tube 
dimensioned for forcible insertion into said recess for opening 
said closure to permit the discharge of liquid from and admission 
of replacement air into said substantially rigid liquid 
dispensing container when inverted. Such a cap and system are known from US-A-4 699 188. In 
this known cap and dispensing system, however, the feed tube, 
when inserted, ruptures and pierces through a thin closure 
portion closing off the inner end of the annular sleeve portion. 
Once such piercing has taken place, the closure
