<ABSTRACT>
A safe distance measuring device employing an 
electromagnetic wave is provided. A laser diode (2) is energized 

to emit laser beams by a laser diode drive circuit (3) in 
accordance with a clock signal generated by a control circuit 

(29). The emitted laser beams are sequentially changed to 
predetermined scanning directions by a scanner (1) associated 

with control circuit (29). The scanned laser beams from scanner 
(1) are reflected by an object (19) to be received by a photodiode 

(5). An output of the photodiode is applied to control circuit 

(29) through a light receiving circuit (6) where an elapsed time 
from emission to receipt is computed to obtain a distance from 

scanner (1) to object (19). Based on data relating to scanning 
directions by a scanning position detector (4), a begin-and-end 

detecting circuit (28) can stop the radiation of electromagnetic 
waves around a scanning start point and a scanning end point 

which is danger to human bodies.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a distance measuring device for
measuring a distance from the device to an object by using a
laser beam or an electromagnetic wave, and more particularly
to an improved device designed for a safety operation.Referring to Fig. 11, there is shown a block diagram of a
conventional distance measuring device employing a laser beam.
In accordance with a clock generated from a controller 7, a
laser diode (LD) 2 is energized to emit laser beams by a laser
diode (LD) driver 3. The laser beams as a kind of
electromagnetic waves are sequentially changed to a
predetermined directions by a scanner 1 associated with
controller 7. Thus emitted laser beams are partially reflected
by an object (omitted in the drawing) to be received by a
photodiode (PD) 5 for application to controller 7 through a
light receiving circuit 6. A scanning position detector 4 is
designed to detect a scanning direction and a scanning angular
speed of scanner 1 to be applied to controller 7.Scanner 1 for sequentially changing the emitted beams
into the predetermined directions will be described 
hereinafter in detail in reference to Fig. 12.In Fig. 12, beams emitted from laser diode 2 are changed
to parallel beams P by a collimator lens 9. The parallel beams
P are changed to a predetermined direction by a stationary
mirror 11 and a scanning mirror 13 for emission. Scanning
mirror 13 is adapted to be driven by a motor (omitted in
drawings) for sequential scanning directions.The scanning direction of the radiated parallel beams P
can be detected by the scanning position detector having a
scanning control laser diode 15 and a position sensing diode
(PSD) 17. The scanning direction can be detected by finding a
position of position sensing diode 17 which receives a beam
emitted from scanning control diode 15 through scanning mirror
13 of a both side mirror type.As shown in Fig. 13, the emitted beams from scanner 1 are
reflected by an object 19. When the reflected beams are
received, an elapsed time T1 from emission to receipt is
calculated by controller 7. At the same time, the scanning
direction (angular speed) can be detected. In view of these
data, a distance calculation circuit 8 of Fig. 11 calculates
the following distance. A linear distance D from scanner 1 to
object 19 can be obtained by multiplying a speed of light by
an elapsed time and dividing by two as shown by an equation:
D= T1 X 299792458/2 [m]. The vertical distance Dc and the
parallel distance Ds can be obtained by the following 
equations.
Dc = D X COS Óúç
