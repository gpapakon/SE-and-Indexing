The present invention relates to the field of health-care and more particularly to women's hygiene. More particularly, it relates to fixing straps arranged asymmetrically along the longitudinal edge of the sanitary towel of which the adhering part is the internal part for the user of the towel and being integral with the towel. The invention also relates to a method for producing hygienic articles fitted with said lateral flaps, and consisting in emprisonning the absorbing pad formed of cellulose or composite paste, of the sanitary towel, between a polyethylene film and non-woven textile layer or microperforated polyethylene film which is outwardly tight to liquids, in sealing both films by gluing or thermosealing, cutting the web of previously formed textile material comprised of the pad and of both protection layers of liquid-tight film while forming an ondulated ribbon in the form of guirland, depositing on said guirland a one-face silicon-coated paper whose internal face has been previously coated continuously or discontinuously with glue, and laying a second single face silicon-coated paper whose internal face has been previously coated with one or a plurality of glue dots laying on the lateral flaps backfolded to the internal face.
