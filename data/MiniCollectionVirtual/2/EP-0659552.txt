<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a polypropylene 
laminated film which has a good low-temperature 
heat sealability and hot tack property and 
moreover has a good transparency, blocking resistance 
and printability; and a process for producing the same. Biaxially oriented crystalline polypropylene 
film (abbreviated as BOPP) has been widely used as a 
packaging film by virtue of its good stiffness, transparency 
and moisture impermeability. However, BOPP 
itself is unsatisfactory in heat sealability. Therefore, 
there have hitherto been widely used laminated 
films obtained by laminating a resin having a good heat 
sealability (hereinafter heat sealing resin) on one or 
both surfaces of a BOPP or by co-extruding such a resin 
with a BOPP. Of the properties required for the heat 
sealing resin, low-temperature heat sealability has 
been considered to be most important, and lowering the 
heat sealing temperature of the heat sealing resin has 
hitherto been of greatest concern in the art. This is 
because lowering the heat sealing temperature of the 
heat sealing resin permits speedup of the process of 
making bags of laminated film and improves the productivity. 
It is needless to say that such properties as 
transparency and blocking resistance of the sealing  
 
resin are also important. In recent years, however, diversification 
of package types, diversification of articles to be 
packaged and attending diversification of packaging 
machines have been rapidly advancing. In the circumstances, 
the hot tack property, which has previously 
been not regarded as so important property of the heat 
sealing resin, has come to be of great concern as well 
as low-temperature heat sealability. Various resins have hitherto been proposed 
as the heat sealing resin for BOPP. A widely known 
propylene-based heat sealing resin is a propyleneethylene 
copolymer copolymerized with about 5% by 
weight of ethylene. This copolymer is superior in 
transparency and blocking resistance but is quite 
unsatisfactory in low-temperature heat sealability. 
Increasing the ethylene content of the propyleneethylene 
copolymer for improving the low temperature 
heat sealability of the copolymer can improve the low-temperature 
heat sealability to a certain extent, but 
causes great deterioration of transparency and blocking 
resistance. Another widely known copolymer is 
propylene-butene-1 copolymer obtained by copolymerization 
of propylene and butene-1. For example, JP-A-50-128781 
and JP-A-55-17542 disclose a propylene-butene-1 
cop
