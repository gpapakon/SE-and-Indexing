<ABSTRACT>
A navigation system for guiding a user to a destination in accordance 
with a predetermined route, comprises : point coordinate input means for 

inputting the data of point coordinates, which are acquired from either an 
absolute coordinate list prepared to correspond to the information of the 

destination or a map having the absolute coordinates recorded therein, in 
a screen or by a voice ; destination setting means for setting the 

destination on the basis of the point coordinate data inputted; and display 
means for displaying the set point of the destination in a route guiding 

map. The navigation system may further comprise point coordinate 
receiving means for receiving the point coordinate data transmitted. Then, 

the point coordinate input means inputs the point coordinate data through 
communications.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a navigation system for guiding a
user to a destination via a predetermined route and, more particularly, to
a navigation system having a function to set point data by inputting the
absolute coordinates by operations or through communications.The navigation system guides the user a route so that he or she
can visit a first destination safely by car. In recent years, the technology
for improving the performances or functions such as the precision,
operability or visibility of navigation has been vigorously developed, and a
variety of types have been proposed. This navigation system is equipped
with a display screen to be used for setting the route and a display screen
to be opened automatically or in response to a demand of the driver when
the route is to be guided. The display screen after the guide start is
formed with a section diagram covering a wide range of several sections
including a plurality of sections set with the route and the section, in
which the automobile is running, and an intersection diagram for guiding
the driver at road intersections.Some navigation systems provide the information the residual
distance, name and right or left turn of the intersection, at which the
automobile should turn to follow the correct route, teach the
characteristics, by which the driver can confirm the route in his or her
course, and make not only a display but also a guide by a voice.In this navigation system, the starting point and the destination have 
to be inputted so as to set the route. When the starting point and the
destination are determined by this inputting, the route is searched for from
the neighborhoods of the starting point and the destination and the road
information data inbetween so that the optimum route is selectively set
from a plurality of routes. For example, there have been proposed : a
system in which the target position registered such as the starting point
or the destination is classified according to the sight - seeing, the parking
zones or restaurants and is coded according to the areas such as the
prefectures or cities so that the data are inputted in terms of the codes;
a system in which menus are displayed so that they may be sequentially
selectively inputted; a system in which node data are connected to define
a road net so that the position is inputted in terms of the east longitude
and north latitude coordinates ; and a system in which the telephone
number is inputted.This kind of system is exemplified by the telephone number inputting
syste
