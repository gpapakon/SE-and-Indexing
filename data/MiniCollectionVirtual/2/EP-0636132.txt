<DESCRIPTION>
 Substituted Nitrogen Containing Spiro Compounds for Use in Treating Cognitive Deficits FIELD OF THE INVENTIONThis invention relates to novel spirocyclic compounds, pharmaceutical compositions containing them and methods of using them in mammals to treat cognitive deficiencies and/or neurological dysfunction and/or mood disturbances as found, for example, in degenerative nervous system diseases .BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTIONNervous system disorders cause cognitive and neurological deficiencies and are becoming more prevalent in today's society. Many of these disorders are age related and/or the direct result of degenerative changes in the nervous system. Specific neurological systems are often directly affected in the early stages of some diseases (e.g. cholinergic systems in Alzheimer's Disease and the dopamineregic system in Parkinson's Disease), while multiple neurotransmitter system deficiencies (acetylcholine, dopamine, seretonin, norepinephrine) are generally found at later stages of diseases such as senile dementia, multi-infarct dementia, Huntington's disease, etc. This may explain the generally observed symptomology including cognitive, neurological and effective/psychotic components (see Gottfries, Psychσpharmacol. ££, 245, 1985) . Deficits in the synthesis and release of acetylcholine in the brain are generally thought to be related to cognitive impairment (see Francis et al, New England J. Med.r 313, 7, 1985) .Recent treatment strategies for neurodegenerative diseases include vasoactive drugs like vincamine and pentoxifylline; "metabolic enhancers" like ergoloid mesylates, piracetam and naftidrofuryl; neurotransmitter precursors like -DOPA, choline and 5-hydroxytryptamine; metabolizing enzyme inhibitors like physostigmine; and neuropeptides like ACTH and vasopressin-related peptides. Another strategy is to enhance the residual function of the 

affected systems by enhancing the stimulus-induced release of neurotransmitters. Such an enhancement might improve the signal-to-noise ratio during chemical transmission of information, thereby reducing deficits in processes related to cognition, neurological function and mood regulation. Cook, If . , et al., Drug Development Research 19:301- 314 (1990), Nickolson, V.J., et al., Drug Development Research 19:285-300 (1990), and DeNoble, V. J., et al., Pharmacology Biochemistry & Behavior, Vol. 36, pp. 957-961 (1990) , all have shown by invitro testing that the drug DuP 996, 3.3-bis (4-pyridinylmethyl)-l-phenylindolin-2-one, is useful in the treatment of
