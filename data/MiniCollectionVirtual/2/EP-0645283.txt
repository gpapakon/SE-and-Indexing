<ABSTRACT>
A vehicle article carrier (20) for securing cargo and other like 
items elevationally above the roof (22) of a vehicle. The vehicle 

article carrier (20) includes pair of support members (26,28) 
fixed to the 

roof of the vehicle, a bracket member (74,76) disposed on each of the 
support members (26,28) and a cross bar (70,72) 

extending between the bracket 
members. Each of the bracket members (74,76) is slidably positionable 

along its associated support member (26,28). Each support member (26,28) 
further 

includes a main channel (238) having a depending lip (238a) portion which 
includes an aperture or notch (238b) formed therein. The aperture or 

notch (238b) is adapted to positively engage with a hook (184) of the 
associated bracket member (26,28) to seen more positively secure the 

bracket member (74,76) to the support member (26,28).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates generally to vehicle 
article or luggage carriers and more particularly to a new 
and improved vehicle luggage carrier of the type shown in 
US-A-4,684,048. US-A-4,684,048 discloses an article carrier having 
the construction described in conjunction with Figures 1-13 
of the drawings of the present application. The article 
carrier disclosed in US-A-4,684,048 is adapted to be 
secured to a motor vehicle adjacent to a generally 
horizontally extending vehicle body surface and comprises: 
a pair of elongate support members adapted to be 
secured to the vehicle, each said support member having a 
bottom portion adapted to be disposed in generally facing 
relation towards said vehicle body surface and to rest 
generally flush against said vehicle body surface, an upper 
and outer side portion curving gradually upwardly and 
inwardly in diverging relation to said bottom portion, and 
an elongated main channel member opening along a plane 
which diverges from a plane extending generally 
perpendicularly from said bottom portion of said support 
member, wherein said channel member is offset from a 
longitudinal centerline of said support member;  at least one cross member having two end portions and 
disposed generally perpendicularly between said support 
members to extend elevationally above and generally  
 
parallel to said vehicle body surface;  locking means associated with said cross member at 
each of said two end portions for releasably locking said 
cross member in a selected position on each said support 
member, said locking means having a housing with a locking 
hook member extending therefrom; and  actuating means pivotally associated with said 
locking means at a first pivot point and with said locking 
means at a second pivot point for moving said locking hook 
member generally linearly inwardly and outwardly of said 
locking means in response to manual movement of said 
actuating member pivotally relative to said locking means 
releasably to secure said locking means and said cross 
member at a desired position along said support members.  According to the present invention there is provided 
an article carrier adapted to be secured to a motor vehicle 
adjacent to a generally horizontally extending vehicle body 
surface, the carrier comprising: 
a pair of elongate support members adapted to be 
secured to said vehicle, each said support member having a 
bottom portion adapted to be disposed in generally facing

<CLAIMS>
An article carrier (20) adapted to be secured 
to a motor vehicle (24) adjacent to a generally 

horizontally extending vehicle body surface (22), the 
carrier comprising: 


a pair of elongate support members (200, 300, 400, 
500, 600, 700) adapted to be secured to said vehicle, each 

said support member having a bottom portion adapted to be 
disposed in generally facing relation toward said vehicle 

body surface and to rest generally flush against said 
vehicle body surface, an upper and outer side portion (230, 

330, 430, 530, 630) curving gradually upwardly and inwardly 
in diverging relation to said bottom portion, and an 

elongated main channel member (238, 338, 438, 538, 638, 
738) opening along a plane which diverges from a plane 

extending generally perpendicularly from said bottom 
portion of said support member, wherein said channel member 

is offset from a longitudinal centerline of said support 
member; 
at least one cross member (70) having two end 
portions and disposed generally perpendicularly between 

said support members (200, 300, 400, 500, 600, 700) to 
extend elevationally above and generally parallel to said 

vehicle body surface; 
locking means (74,76) associated with said cross 
member (70) at each of said two end portions for releasably 

locking said cross member in a selected position on each  
 

said support member (200, 300, 400, 500, 600, 700), said 
locking means having a housing with a locking hook member 

(184) extending therefrom; 
said channel member (238, 338, 438, 538, 638, 738) 
having a generally vertically depending lip portion (238a, 

338a, 438a, 538a, 638a, 738a) forming a secondary channel, 
said lip portion having a plurality of spaced apart 

openings (238b, 338b, 438b, 538b, 638b, 738b) sized so as 
to allow a portion (192) of said locking hook member (184) 

to protrude therethrough into said secondary channel, 
thereby positively to lock said locking means to said 

support member; and 
actuating means (168) pivotally associated with said 
locking means (74, 76) at a first pivot point and with said 

locking means at a second pivot point for moving said 
locking hook member (184) generally linearly inwardly and 

outwardly of said locking means and in a direction 
generally perpendicular to said locking portion (192) in response 

to manual movement of said actuating member pivotally 
relative to said locking means such that said locking hook 

member cooperates with said depending lip portion (238a, 
338a, 438a, 538a, 638a, 738a) of said support member 

releasably to secure said locking means and said cross 
member at a desired position along said support members. 
The article carrier of claim 1, wherein said 
channel member (238, 338, 438, 538, 638, 738) includes a 

bottom wall portion (251, 351, 451, 551, 651, 751) said lip  
 

portion (238a, 338a, 438a, 538a, 638a, 738a) being disposed 
generally perpendicular to said bottom wall portion. 
The article carrier of claim 1 or claim 2, 
wherein said openings comprise apertures (238b, 538b) 

formed in said lip portion (238a, 538a). 
The article carrier of claim 1 or claim 2, 
wherein said openings comprise notches (338b, 438b, 638b, 

738b) formed in said lip portion (338a, 438a, 638a, 738a).
