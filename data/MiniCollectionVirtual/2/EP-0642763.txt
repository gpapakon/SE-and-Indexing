<ABSTRACT>
A resilient filament retaining package 100 
includes a plurality of panel members 106 - 116 foldably 

connected to each other along transverse sides thereof and 
arranged to fold upon each other to form a plurality of 

superposed compartments defined between pairs of adjacent 
panel members. Each compartment is dimensioned to contain 

at least one flexible resilient filament portion therein in 
a coiled configuration. Receiving port apertures 106a - 114a 

are provided in the forward panel member of each 
compartment and are intended to assist in loading 

individual filament portions in each compartment. The 
apertures are in general concentric alignment with each 

other such that each compartment may be accessed for 
loading purposes from a front side of the folded retainer 

package. A backing panel 104 having a needle securing park 
122 may be attached to the folded package. A method for 

loading the package is also disclosed. The package can be 
particularly useful for retaining surgical sutures.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a new and useful 
retainer package for resilient filaments and more 
particularly to a package for retaining at least one 
resilient surgical suture in a manner for ready removal. Many surgical sutures possess certain mechanical 
characteristics such as stiffness and a tendency to be 
wire-like and resilient. In the past, such sutures have 
been retained in packages having interconnected panel 
members. Typically, the suture is wound in a figure-eight 
or coiled configuration about winding projections which 
extend through apertures formed in one of the panels of the 
package. The remaining panels of the package are then 
folded onto the suture to enclose the suture within the 
package. A disadvantage with these methods is that the 
sutures can be damaged during loading and/or storage. In 
the figure-eight configuration, for example, kinking and 
wearing can occur where the sutures cross over. When using 
winding projections, for example, the sutures can be 
damaged by stress when being wound. The afore described packages for retaining a 
surgical suture have also failed to take advantage of the 
resilient qualities of certain suture materials to aid in 
the loading of the package. In particular, it has been 
found that a surgical suture having resilient 
characteristics such as catgut or some of the synthetic  
 
suture products including polypropylene and polyester may be 
inserted or fed into an opening in the package in a manner 
such that during insertion the suture naturally assumes a 
coiled configuration within the package. A retainer package according to the preamble of claim 1 is 
known from EP-A-0 505 612. A package for surgical suture 
material is also known from DE-U-8 631 420. This known 
package comprises a plurality of suture compartments in an 
aligned configuration and can be folded such that respective 
lines of the compartments superimpose each other. Each 
compartment has an opening through which an end of a suture 
within the compartment extends.  
 Accordingly, there is a need for suture retainers 
which reduce or prevent damage to sutures during loading 
and/or storage. There is also a need for suture retainers 
with internal cavities or retaining areas, which do not 
necessitate the utilization of winding projections around 
which sutures must be wound to be loaded. There is also a 
need for suture retainers which are adapted to store 
sutures in a configuration which avoids or reduces crossover 
points. It is also desirable to provide a package 
which

<CLAIMS>
A retainer package for resilient filaments which 
comprises: 


a plurality of resilient-filament panel members 
(106-116) foldably connected to each other along 

transverse sides thereof and arranged to fold upon each 
other to form a plurality of superposed resilient-filament 

compartments defined between pairs of adjacent 
panel members, each said resilient-filament compartment 

dimensioned to contain at least one resilient-filament 
portion (B) therein in a coiled configuration; and 
resilient-filament receiving port means associated 
with each said resilient-filament compartment for 

loading flexible resilient filament portions (B) in said 
resilient-filament compartments,
 
   wherein each said resilient-filament compartment 

includes a forward panel member and a rear panel member 
and said resilient-filament receiving port means 

comprises an aperture (106a-114a) formed in each said 
forward panel member of each said resilient-filament 

compartment,
 
   characterized in that
 
said apertures (106a-114a) are in general concentric 

alignment with each other whereby each said resilient-filament 
compartment may be accessed from a front side 

of the retainer package (100) when said resilient-filament 
panel members (106-116) are in a folded 

condition and said apertures (106a-114a) incrementally  
 

decrease in diameter from a front most resilient-filament 
compartment to a rear most resilient-filament 

compartment. 
The retainer package according to claim 1, wherein said 
resilient-filament receiving port means comprises a 

circular aperture (106a-114a).

comprising an aperture overlying panel member (118) 

foldably connected to a lower edge of one of said 
resilient-filament panel members (106-116), said 

aperture panel member (118) adapted to fold onto said 
front most resilient-filament compartment to
