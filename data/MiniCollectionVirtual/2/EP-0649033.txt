<ABSTRACT>
A process for locating a transmitter in which the signal is 
received by first and second receivers and then processed 

by respective analog to digital converters and filtered to 
yield first and second digital signals. There is relative 

motion between at least one of the receivers and the transmitter. 
A compression process local to the first receiver 

compresses the first digital signal. The result of the 
compression process is transmitted to a cross-correlation 

unit which is local to the second receiver and coupled also 
to receive the second digital signal. Locally to the first 

receiver, correction factors for the solution to the cross-correlation 
function are determined and transmitted to a 

correction unit at the second receiver site which applies 
the correction factors to the solution of the cross-correlation 

function. The location of the transmitter is 
determined based on time difference of arrival and frequency 

difference of arrival results output from the correction 
unit. If there is no relative motion between the 

transmitter and any receiver, then three receivers are necessary 
to locate the transmitter. The outputs are analog 

to digital converted and filtered to yield first, second 
and third digital signals. A compression process at the 

first receiver site compresses the first digital signal. 
The compressed signal data is transmitted to convolution 

units local to the second and third receivers and convolved 
with the second and third digital signals, respectively. 

Then correction factors for both convolution units are 
determined local to the first receiver and transmitted to 

correction units at both the second and third receiver 
sites. The location of the transmitter is then determined 

based on two time difference of arrival results.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates generally to radar, and deals more 
particularly with an improved technique using signal Time. 
Difference Of Arrival (TDOA) and/or Frequency Difference Of 
Arrival (FDOA) measured at two or more spaced receiver 
sites to determine the location of a transmitter. It was previously known that TDOA and FDOA of radio or 
microwave signals measured at two or more separated 
receiver sites can be used to locate the transmitter. TDOA 
is a result of the path length or range difference between 
the transmitter and each receiver site, properties of the 
propagation medium and the corresponding propagation time 
difference between the transmitter and the receiver sites. 
If the transmitter site or either of the receiver sites is 
moving, a signal frequency shift or doppler shift occurs 
due to the motion. The FDOA is based on the characteristics 
of the propagation medium and the locations and 
velocities of the transmitter and receiver sites.

The delay difference τ = (R₁ - R₂)/cThe frequency difference ν = f(R₁ - R₂)/c. Here, Ri is the range from the transmitter to the ith 
receiver, R ˙i is time rate of change of range or relative 
velocity between the transmitter and receiver, c is the 
speed of propagation, and f is the transmitter frequency. The τ measurement defines a contour on the surface of the 
earth. If there is a third receiver site, then two independent 
τ contours can be determined. The intersection of 
two such contours establishes the transmitter location. 
The ν measurement also defines a contour on the surface of 
the earth. Two independent ν measurements can be obtained  
 
using three receiver sites provided at least two of the 
receiver sites are moving. The intersection of two such 
contours establishes the transmitter location when the 
transmitter is stationary. When the transmitter is moving, 
two ν measurements can be used to estimate its velocity if 
its location is known. In this case, receive site motion 
is not required. When the transmitter is stationary and at 
least one of two receiver sites is moving, a single τ and a 
single ν can be determined and the two receiver sites are 
sufficient to locate the transmitter. A prior art technique is illustrated in Figure 1. The 
transmitted signal is received by a receiver 9 at a 
receiver site 10 and by a receiver 11 at a spaced receiver 
site 12. Either or both receiver sites are moving relative 
to the transmitter 13. The signal received at site 10 is A/D converted by process 
16 into a "real sampled signal". The
