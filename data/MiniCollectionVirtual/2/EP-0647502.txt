<ABSTRACT>
Compressed air is introduced into a cylinder chamber 
64 to displace a piston 20 closely to a target position. 

Then, a ball screw shaft 22 is rotated about its own axis by 
an electric motor 26 to inch the piston 20 to the target 

position. Upon arrival of the piston 20 at the target 
position, the ball screw shaft 22 is stopped by a brake 

mechanism to hold the piston 20 accurately in the target 
position. The drive shaft 28 of the electric motor 26 

extends parallel to the ball screw shaft 22, thus reducing 
the entire length of a servo cylinder apparatus 10. 

Solenoid-operated directional control valves 14, 34 for 
supplying compressed air to the cylinder chamber 64 and the 

brake mechanism are coupled integrally to a cylinder 
assembly, so that pipes are shortened for allowing the 

piston 20 to be displaced and stopped quickly and 
accurately.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a servo cylinder apparatus 
according to the preamble of claim 1. There have heretofore been known actuators for displacing a 
workpiece on a table that is fixed to the distal end of the 
piston rod of a cylinder. One actuator structure has a piston 
rod coupled to a piston which is housed in a cylinder chamber 
for axial displacement therein under a pneumatic pressure. 
According to another actuator design, a piston rod is 
connected to a ball screw which is rotated by an electric 
motor or the like for displacing the piston rod (cf. U.S. 
Patent No. 4,137,784). The former actuator structure is capable of displacing a heavy 
workpiece as it can produce large output power. However, since 
the air is a compressible fluid, it is difficult to position 
the workpiece accurately. The latter actuator design can stop a workpiece in an accurate 
position as the electric motor is electrically controlled. 
However, if a heavy workpiece is to be conveyed  
 
and positioned, then it is necessary to employ an electric 
motor capable of generating large output power, and such an 
electric motor is necessarily large in size. In view of the above conventional actuator drawbacks, there 
has been proposed a hybrid actuator system which has a 
cylinder for conveying a workpiece under pneumatic pressure 
to a zone near a position in which the workpiece is to be 
stopped, and an electric motor for moving the workpiece from 
the zone and stopping it accurately in the position (EP-A-225 276, 
US-A-3 251 249, Japanese 
Patent laid-open No. 48-066 208 (corresponding to FR-A-2 164 416), 
Japanese Utility Model 
Publication No. 60-032 456, Japanese Patent Publication No. 
4-045 687 corresponding to EP-A-0 106 947)). Since the 
electric motor which is used may be 
small in size, the proposed hybrid actuator system may also 
be small in size. The proposed hybrid actuator system is also 
advantageous in that it can stop the workpiece accurately in 
a desired position. The proposed hybrid actuator system has a solenoid-operated 
directional control valve disposed in fluid passages for 
supplying and discharging the pneumatic pressure to and from 
the cylinder. If a brake mechanism for stopping the workpiece 
is operated also under pneumatic pressure, then the brake 
mechanism is associated with a solenoid-operated directional 
control valve. As the distance between the cylinder and its 
solenoid-operated directional control valve or the distance 
between the brake mechanism and its solenoid-operated
