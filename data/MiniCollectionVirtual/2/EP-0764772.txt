<ABSTRACT>
When an electric current is supplied to an 
electrically heated catalyst (5) mounted on a vehicle, oxygen 

that is required is supplied by setting the air-to-fuel 
ratio to become lean, and the engine (1) during this period 

is prevented from losing stability. When the 
electrically heated catalyst is in a condition to be 

supplied with an electric current, the alternator (9) driven 
by the internal combustion engine is disconnected from 

the battery (8) and the current is supplied to the 
electrically heated catalyst. At the same time, the air-to-fuel 

ratio of the internal combustion engine is set to 
the lean region, and a deviation is found between the 

present engine running speed and the target running speed 
found from the operation conditions of the engine. The 

field current of the alternator is controlled toward a 
direction in which the deviation decreases and, at the 

same time, the amount of electric power supplied from the 
alternator to the electrically heated catalyst is 

monitored. When an average amount of electric power 
supplied within a predetermined period of time becomes 

smaller than a predetermined value, the running speed of 
the internal combustion engine is forcibly increased to 

promote the rise of temperature based upon the reaction 
of the catalyst with the fuel and, at the same time, the 

internal combustion engine is prevented from losing 
stability even under the lean conditions.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an apparatus
for controlling an internal combustion engine mounting an
electrically heated catalyst. More particularly, the
invention relates to an apparatus for controlling an
internal combustion engine in which an electric current
is supplied to an electrically heated catalyst attached
to the exhaust gas passage in order to promote the
activation of the catalyst, wherein the secondary air is
not supplied at the time of electrically heating the
catalyst but, instead, a lean air-to-fuel ratio is
established to increase the amount of oxygen in order to
accomplish the rise in the temperature based upon the
reaction of the catalyst with the fuel.Exhaust gases emitted from an internal
combustion engine of a vehicle contain such harmful
substances as HC (hydrocarbons) and NOx (nitrogen
oxides). In an exhaust gas passage of an internal
combustion engine is usually provided a catalytic
converter which is a device for removing impurities
contained in the exhaust gases. However, it has been
known that when the temperature of the catalyst is low
(in an inactive state), the three-way catalyst used in
the catalytic converter works to remove only some of the
harmful substances contained in the exhaust gases.
Therefore, when the catalytic converter is in the
inactive state after cold starting of the internal
combustion engine, the exhaust gases cannot be cleaned to
a sufficient degree.There has been proposed a device for cleaning
exhaust gases which is installed in the exhaust gas 
passage on the upstream side of the catalytic converter,
the device incorporating an electrically heated second
catalytic converter (EHC: electrically heated catalyst)
carrying an oxidizing catalyst and having an electric
heater, so that when the catalytic converter is still
inactive, the second catalytic converter is electrically
heated to activate the oxidizing catalyst and to promote
the removal of HC.Electric power must be supplied to the second
catalytic converter (hereinafter referred to as
electrically heated catalyst) only until the catalytic
converter is activated. So far, therefore, a constant
amount of electric power has been supplied for only a
predetermined period of time in which the electric
current must be supplied to the electrically heated
catalyst such as at the time of cold starting of the
internal combustion engine. However, the electrically
heated catalyst exhibits different temperature-rise
characteristics depending upon the conditions of the
internal combustion engine. Recently,
