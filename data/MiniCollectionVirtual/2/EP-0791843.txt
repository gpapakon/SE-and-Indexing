<ABSTRACT>
A connector for optical fibers using a multi-fiber ferrule, such as 
the MT ferrule or similar ferrule, that can be plugged into 

and received by an optical receptacle. Multiple alignment 
features help align and mate the connector to another multi-fiber 

object. The connector has a guide prong (50) or forward 
extension beneath which is mounted the ferrule (32). The prong 

provides a reference surface that functions as a precise pre-alignment 
mechanism for the ferrule. Also, the prong has a 

groove that mates with a corresponding rail of the receptacle 
when the connector is plugged into the receptacle ensuring 

that the connector is properly seated within the receptacle. 
Further, the ferrule has apertures (40) that align with and 

receive guide pins of the lightguide means or active device.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention pertains to a fiber optic 
connector employing a multi-fiber ferrule such as a 
Mechanical Transfer (MT) ferrule or similar type 
ferrule that will mate with an optical transceiver, 
which transceiver is the subject of a U.S. patent 
application being filed concurrently herewith entitled 
"Receptacle for Multi-Fiber Connector" and assigned to 
a common assignee. Fiber optic cables are typically joined to 
one another or connected to active, light emitting or 
receiving devices, and often, multiple optical fibers 
must be simultaneously coupled. Further, it is often 
difficult to properly align abutting fibers or to align 
such fibers to active devices, such as light sources or 
light sensors. If misalignment occurs, light passing 
through the connection will be attenuated and 
transmission quality degraded. In instances where a multi-fiber connector is 
used and the active device is configured in an array 
containing many such devices, an intermediate 
lightguide means can be used for aligning and mating 
the active devices to the connector at the end of the 
optical fibers. Lightguide means, as used herein, is 
typically a block of plastic or glass material provided 
with minute holes or light pipes extending through the 
block for conducting light from one end of the block to  
 
the other. The minute holes or light pipes of the 
lightguide means align with the optical fibers of the 
connector. Lightguide features can also be used to 
align and mate together two multi-fiber cables. Optical cable fibers can be fitted with a 
ferrule which houses or encapsulates the fiber ends and 
aids in aligning the fibers. The ferrule also helps to 
protect the fibers from damage especially during the 
processes of connecting and disconnecting. One of the 
commonly used connector ferrules is the Mechanical 
Transfer (MT) ferrule. The MT ferrule is a multi-fiber 
device typically used to simultaneously connect 
multiple fibers. Currently, a common multi-fiber connector 
does not exist that uses the MT ferrule and that can 
connect into an optical transceiver. Other multi-fiber 
connectors employing a ferrule, such as the mechanical 
transfer plug (MTP) and the multiple access connector 
(MAC) are used for multi-fiber terminations. Such 
devices are not cost effective to manufacture because 
their components are generally tubular and must be 
threaded onto the ferrule-cable subassembly. Also, the 
MTP and the MAC are not as compact as needed for some 
applications such as high density back planes.

<CLAIMS>
A multi-fiber optical connector having a front end 
and a rear end and comprising: 


a generally U-shaped enclosure having a center wall 
and an integral pair of depending side walls extending from 

the center wall in a generally parallel fashion from 
longitudinal edges of said center wall, said enclosure having 

an integral pair of fingers with inwardly turned ends 
extending longitudinally from said side walls, and an 

integral spring tab extending longitudinally from said center 
wall, said fingers and said tab located at the front end of 

said connector; 
a ferrule having a front surface with at least two 
apertures for receiving two guide pins from a second multi-fiber 

object, said ferrule having an upper surface and a 
lower surface, said ferrule in addition having opposed side 

surfaces positioned between the fingers of said U-shaped 
enclosure; and 
a connector body having a guide prong providing a 
reference surface for engaging the upper surface of the 

ferrule while the tab of said U-shaped enclosure engages the 
lower surface of the ferrule and forces it against the 

reference surface of said prong. 
A connector as in claim 1, wherein said ferrule is 
a mechanical transfer ferrule. 
A multi-fiber optical connector as in claim 1, for 
insertion into a receptacle, said connector further 

comprising: 

a latching means configured to engage said 
connector body, said latching means having arms with notches 

corresponding to projections on said receptacle such that 
said notc
hes engage and lock onto said projections when said 
connector is inserted into said receptacle; and 
a slide means having a forward end and center wall 
with side walls extending in a general parallel fashion from 

 
longitudinal edges of the center wall, said side walls having 

a textured outer surface and inwardly directed longitudinal 
edges extending in a generally parallel direction to the 

plane of the center wall, said slide means having in addition 
a tongue extending from the forward end of said center wall 

said tongue engaging said latch and said slide engaging said 
connector body. 
A connector as in claim 1, wherein said connector 
further comprises: 


a saddle member, said member having center and side 
walls extending in a generally parallel fashion from 

longitudinal edges of said center wall, said side walls 
having an integral pair of fingers extending longitudinally 

from a front end of said side walls; 
coil spring means seated on said fingers, 
said center wall having an integral strength member 
tie-off tab extending longitudinally from the rear end of 

said center wall, said saddle member abutting said ferrule 
such that said spring means forces said ferrule against the 

inwardly turned ends of the fingers of the U-shaped 
enclosure. 
A connector as in claim 3, wherein said connector 
houses one end of a fiber optic cable and an end portion of a 

plastic jacket encasing said cable, said connector further 
comprising: 


a strain relief boot encasing the end portion of
