<ABSTRACT>
In digital communication systems such as digital paging, alpha-numeric messages are normally encoded character-by-character using say the ASCII bit character set. The number of bits concerned in sending such messages can be reduced by arranging the primary and secondary stations in a communications system to have ROMs which store a common dictionary. If a word to be sent is stored in the ROM then its location address is transmitted as a 7-bit character pair. However, if a word is not present in the ROM then it is encoded using ASCII characters. The data field (DF) of the transmitted message signal is preceded by and concatenated with a command and control field (CCF) which includes an indication that word compression has been used and indications which can be used by a receiver to determine when the ASCII characters begin and end in the data field.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a digital communications system
and to a transmitting apparatus and a receiving apparatus for use in the
system. More particularly, the present invention relates to the compression
of alpha-numeric messages for transmission in digital communication
systems such as digital radiopaging system.For convenience of description the present invention will be
described with reference to a digital radiopaging system but it is to be
understood that the present invention is applicable to other digital
transmission systems.An internationally used digital paging code is the CCIR Radiopaging
Code No 1 which is also known as POCSAG (Post Office Code
Standardisation Advisory Group). Details of this radiopaging code are given
in a book entitled "The Book of the CCIR Radiopaging Code No 1"
published by the Radiopaging Code Standards Group (RCSG) in 1986.
Appendix 1 discloses the specification for a standard Code Format for use
in Wide Area Radiopaging Systems the details of which will be known by
those skilled in the art. However, for the sake of completeness the signal
format used comprises a batch structure consisting of preamble and a
succession of concatenated batches. Each batch consists of a
synchronisation code word plus 8 frames each comprising 2 code words,
making a total of 17 code words. There are two types of code words,
address code words and message code words each comprising 32 bits. In
the case of a message code word 20 bits, that is bit 2 to bit 21 inclusive,
form a data field and these are followed by parity check bits. Bits 20 and 
21 of an address code word, which precedes the message code word(s),
are function bits and are used to select the format of decoding of
concatenated message code words. Appendix 1, subsection 4.1 states
that for the sole transmission of messages in decimal numbers, 4 bits per
character are used and the function bits are set to 00. Subsection 4.2
refers to an Alpha-numeric or General Data Format and states that the ISO
7-bit coded character set is used and that the function bits are set to 11.
When sending a message, the batch structure is maintained. Thus a
message comprises an address code word and concatenated message code
words plus a synchronisation code word at the beginning of each batch.
As Appendix 1 is quite specific in stating that the formats shall not be
mixed within any one message then the function bits in the address code
word effectively condition the paging receiver to the method of
deformatting the received message.European

<CLAIMS>
A digital communications system comprising a transmitting
means and a receiving means, in which the transmitting means has means

for encoding alpha-numeric messages in at least two formats, at least one of
which formats is a compressed format, characterised in that a data field of

a message is preceded by a command and control field and in that the first
character of the command and control field is indicative of whether a

compressed format has been used in the data field.
A system as claimed in claim 1, characterised in that said first
character is an ASCII 7 bit character.
A system as claimed in Claim 1, characterised in that said
encoding means, when in said compressed format, is adapted to encode

alpha-numeric messages in at least two modes which may switch from one
mode to another mode and vice versa during encoding of a message and in

that the command and control field comprises indications which can be used
by a receiving means to switch from one decoding mode to another decoding

mode and vice versa in order to recover the message data.
A digital communications system comprising a transmitting
means and a receiving means, in which the transmitting means has means

for encoding alpha-numeric messages in at least two modes which may
switch from one mode to the other mode and vice versa during the encoding

of a message, characterised in that a data field of a message is preceded by
a command and control field comprising indications which can be used by a

receiving means to switch from one decoding mode to another decoding
mode and vice versa in order to recover the message data.
A system as claimed in Claim 2, 3 or 4 characterised in that one
encoded mode comprises a first type data structure indicative of at least one

spoken language word and in that another encoded mode comprises a
second type data structure indicative of an individual alpha character.
A system as claimed in Claim 5, characterised in that the first
type data structure comprises a data structure indicative of at least one

spoken language word and a space character. 
A system as claimed in Claim 5, characterised in that the
receiving means comprises a non-volatile memory storing words at

predetermined storage locations and in that the first type data structure
comprises pairs of characters identifying storage locations in the memory,

and in that when said storage location is interrogated the corresponding at
least one spoken language word is read out character by character in the

form of the second type data structure.
A system as claimed in Claim 5, characterised in that said
indications indicate the location of, and number of characters in a series of

individual alpha characters in the data field.
A system as claimed in Claim 8, characterised in that the
number of series of individual alpha characters is limited to a maximum n,

and that when there are n series of individual alpha characters, the nth series
terminates the data message.
A system as claimed in any one of Claims 1 to 4, characterised
in that the command and control field includes an indication of the number

of code words in a message.

data,

whereby said indications are indicative of whether a compressed

format has been used in the data field.
A transmitting apparatus for use in a communications system
