<ABSTRACT>
In a semiconductor circuit device comprising a 
differential amplifier circuit, which is formed on a 

semiconductor substrate and which comprises first and 
second input terminals, and a circuit element formed on 

the semiconductor substrate and connected to one of the 
first and the second input terminals. A dummy circuit 

element is formed on the semiconductor substrate so as to 
adjoin the circuit element for forming between the dummy 

circuit element and the semiconductor substrate a dummy 
parasitic c
apacitor which is equivalent to a parasitic 
capacitor formed between the circuit element and the 

semiconductor substrate. The dummy circuit element is 
connected to the other one of the first and the second 

input terminals. Alternatively, a first resistor connected 
to the first input terminal is formed in a wiring layer so that its 

parasitic capacity is equivalent to the parasitic capacity of the 
feedback resistor.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a semiconductor circuit
device which comprises a differential amplifier circuit.A reference voltage generation circuit is well
known in the art as an example of a semiconductor circuit
device comprising a differential amplifier circuit. In
the case that the reference voltage generation circuit is
implemented by a semiconductor integrated circuit, the
reference voltage generation circuit comprises a
semiconductor substrate, first through third resistors
which are formed on the semiconductor substrate, and the
differential amplifier circuit which is formed on the
semiconductor substrate. The differential amplifier
circuit comprises first and second input terminals and an
output terminal. The first resistor is connected between
a signal input terminal and the first input terminal
through a first wiring pattern. The first resistor and
the first wiring pattern serve as a signal input line. A
second resistor is connected between the output terminal
and the second input terminal through a second wiring
pattern. Furthermore, the second input terminal is
grounded through the third resistor. The first input 
terminal is supplied with an input signal through the
first resistor and has a first input electric potential
or voltage. The second input terminal has a second input
electric potential or voltage.The reference voltage generation circuit
amplifies a differential voltage between the first and
the second input voltages and delivers an amplified
signal to the output terminal as an output signal having
a predetermined reference voltage. The second resistor
serves as a feedback resistor to feedback the output
signal to the second input terminal. Therefore, the
second resistor and the second wiring pattern serve as a
feedback line. The third resistor serves as a voltage
dividing resistor.In the meantime, the reference voltage generation
circuit is inevitable to have first and second parasitic
capacitors. The first parasitic capacitor is formed
between the signal input line and the semiconductor
substrate, in particular, between the first resistor and
the semiconductor substrate. The first parasitic
capacitor has a first capacitance value. Similarly, the
second parasitic capacitor is formed between the feedback
line and the semiconductor substrate, in particular,
between the second resistor and the semiconductor
substrate. The second parasitic capacitor has a second
capacitance value. The first and the second capacitance
values are different from one another. The first and the
second input
