An electron beam exit window, consisting of a frame for vacuum-tight attachment to the 
electron beam generator, a vacuum-tight metal foil which is permeable to the electron beam and a 

support structure for the metal foil, characterized in that a support grating (3) of fibre bundles (4) 
is arranged bearing on the vacuum side of the metal foil (7), consisting of a highly heat resistant 

material, in that the support grating (3) is tensioned in the frame (1) and in that the metal foil (7) 
is arranged vacuum-tight on the frame (1). 
A device according to claim 1, characterized in that the fibre bundles (4) consist of carbon 
filaments which are twisted. 
A device according to claim 1 and/or 2, characterized in that the fibre bundles (4) are 
bound with carbon. 
A device according to claim 1, characterized in that the fibre bundles (4) are attached to 
the frame (1) with a defined sag by a material bond or by interlocking. 
A device according to claim 4, characterized in that the fibre bundles (4) are laid in 
grooves (5) formed in the frame (1) and which are thereafter sealed preferably with cast resin (6). 
A device according to at least one of claims 1 to 5, characterized in that the fibre bundles 
(4) run parallel to one another or cross in the frame (1). 
A device according to claim 6, characterized in that the fibre bundles (4) run at an angle 
a
 
other than 90Â° to the edge of the frame (1). 
A device according to at least one of claims 1 to 7, characterized in that the frame (1) is 
made from carbon fibre reinforced carbon (CFC). 
A device according to at least one of claims 1 to 7, characterized in that the frame (1) is 
made from metal.  

 
A device according to at least one of claims 1 to 9, characterized in that the frame (1) is 
so formed and connected to sealing surfaces or sealing elements that it is simultaneously a sealing 

component. 
A device according to at least one of claims 1 to 10, characterized in that the metal foil 
(7) is made from titanium or a titanium alloy. 
A device according to at least one of claims 1 to 11, characterized in that barrier coatings 

(12) acting as a diffusion barrier are applied to the surfaces of the metal foil (7). 
A device according to claim 12, characterized in that the barrier coating (12) is titanium 
dioxide in the case of fibre bundles (4) of carbon and a metal foil (7) of titanium. 
A device according to at least one of claims 1 to 13, characterized in that the metal foil 
(7) is bonded vacuum tight on to the frame (1). 
A device according to claim 14, characterized in that the bonded region is protected by a 
covering from entry of back-scattered electrons. 
A device according to at least one of claims 1 to 15, characterized in that means for 
creating a cooling gas flow are arranged in the region of the pressure side of the metal foil (7).
