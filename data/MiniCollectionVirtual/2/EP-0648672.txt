<ABSTRACT>
Collating apparatus for collecting and handling 
stacks of generally flat articles (T) comprises a chute 

(40) in which the successive stacks are collected. Each 
completed stack is expelled from the chute by pusher means 

(52) into a carriage (58) of transfer device (54). The 
transfer device has mounted on a rotary axis (56) inclined 

at 45Â°. Each rotation of the transfer device brings one 
carriage to a vertical position to receive the completed 

stack from the chute and brings the stack previously 
loaded into the other carriage to a horizontal position 

over a carton (C) into which the stack is to be deposited.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to collating 
apparatus for forming a stack or row of similar articles, 
especially articles having a generally flat configuration 
and for transferring the stack or row so formed. Continuous processes producing a series of 
individual articles at a high rate usually require means 
for collating the articles at the end of the production 
line in an orderly manner prior to packaging them for 
distribution. EP-A-0059840 and DE-A-3708604 for example, 
disclose collators which collect flat packets of uniform 
size in stacks having a specified number of packets. These known forms of apparatus are limited in 
their rate of operation. For example, in DE-A-3708604 a 
collator has a chute provided with cantilevered platforms 
which travel downwards past the end of the horizontal 
conveyor belt from which the articles tip onto the 
platforms. The rate of delivery of the products is 
synchronised with the speed of descent of the platforms. 
A horizontal pusher below the conveyor belt has its 
movement coordinated with the movement of the platforms to 
clear the stack which has been completed on each platform 
as its descends to the level of the pusher. The capacity 
of such an arrangement is limited, especially in handling 
flat products, eg. because the rate of delivery of the 
product must not exceed the capacity of the pusher to move 
the stacks stably without obstructing the regular delivery  
 
of further articles to the collator. If means are adapted to provide a faster means 
of collating articles into stacks or rows, a problem may 
then arise in the onward transfer of the stacks or rows at 
a sufficient rate to allow the process to be operated 
continuously. According to the present invention, there is 
provided a collating apparatus for a stack of generally 
flat articles comprising a downwardly extending guide for 
containing the articles as they are accumulated in a 
stack, support means within said guide extending 
downwardly from an upper entry region of the guide and 
displaceable with the accumulation of said articles within 
the guide to at least partly compensate for the increasing 
height of the accumulating stack, means being provided for 
engaging the top of a completed stack prior to its removal 
from the guide by take-off means to compress the height of 
the stack, to a transfer device for receiving the stack of 
articles from the guide and transferring them to a filling 
station while reorienting the stack in a substantially 
horizontal position to deposit the

<CLAIMS>
A collating apparatus for a stack of generally 
flat articles comprising a downwardly extending guide (40) 

for containing the articles as they are accumulated in a 
stack, support means (42,44,46,48) within said guide 

extending downwardly from an upper entry region of the 
guide and displaceable with the accumulation of said 

articles within the guide to at least partly compensate 
for the increasing height of the accumulating stack, means 

(50b,50e) being provided for engaging the top of a 
completed stack prior to its removal from the guide by 

take-off means (52) to compress the height of the stack, 
to a transfer device (54) for receiving the stack of 

articles from the guide and transferring them to a filling 

station while reorienting the stack in a substantially 
horizontal position to deposit the stack in a container at 

said station. 
Apparatus according to claim 1 wherein the 
transfer device (54) comprises at least one pair of 

carriages (58) registrable simultaneously with the guide 
(40) and the filling station respectively to deposit one 

stack at the filling station and accept a further stack 
from the guide. 
Apparatus according to claim 2 wherein the 
transfer device (54) is pivotally displaceable about an 

 
inclined axis (56) and said pair of carriages are in 

oppositely inclined positions relative to said rotary axis 
for said pivoting displacement to reposition each stack 

from a downwardly extending orientation to a downwardly 
facing orientation for placing in the container. 
Apparatus according to any one of claims 1 to 3 
wherein means (62) are provided for relative displacement 

between the transfer device (54) and the container to 
deposit successive stacks in different regions of the 

container. 
Apparatus according to claim 4 wherein means 
(68) are provided to insert into the transfer device (54) 

a partitioning element to be deposited in the container 
with a stack to separate successive stacks in the 

container. 
Apparatus according to claim 5 comprising means 
for retaining the planar partitioning element in the 

transfer device (54) prior to the transfer of a stack of 
articles to said device. 
Apparatus according to any one of the preceding 
claims wherein the support means (50) comprises a 

plurality of stack support arrangements having overlapping 
paths within the guide for respective stacks of articles 

and means for driving said support arrangements at 
 

different rates from each other. 
Apparatus according to claim 7 wherein the 
support arrangements comprise article support elements 

which extend inwards from opposite sides of the guide and 
travel along paths that are clear of a central zone of the 

guide, and stack take-off means are operable in said 
central zone. 
A collating apparatus for a stack of flat 
packets comprising guide means (40), for collecting 

individual packets into a stack and a feed means (20) for 
supplying the packets to the guide means, detection means 

(232) for detecting and removing reject packets from the 
feed means, and independent drive means for the feed means 

and for the guide means respectively whereby the guide 
means are operable at a different rate from the feed 

means, and control means (214) arranged to trigger a 
compensating delay in the operation of the guide means 

when a packet is removed by said detection means in order 
to compensate for the absence of the packet from the main 

flow of packets. 
Apparatus according to claim 9 comprising 
sensing means (232) responsive to the arrival of packets 

on the feed means (20) to initiate the operations of the 
drive means for the guide means.
