<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to ionomer compositions, processes for their preparation,
their uses and processes for converting these ionomers.Ionomer compositions may be made by blending individual polymer materials.
The blending can give new property combinations. Ionomer compositions
obtained by the blending of an ionomer with other polymers have found
applications in different areas e.g. heat seal compositions (see for example
EP 94 991) and toughened polyamide combinations (see for example
US 4 078 014).Packaging materials using blends involving ionomers are disclosed in
JP 3092-340-A and JP 8205765-A. Golf ball related prior art includes
US 4274637; JP 1207-343-A; US 4323247; GB 2134799A; WO 87/02039-A; AU
8930892A = US 4990574; JP 600905756A and US 4984804.US 3 819 768 discloses a golf ball cover derived from 90 to 10 percent of an ionic
copolymer of an unsaturated monocarboxylic acid and from 10 to 90 percent of an
ionic copolymer of an olefin and a zinc salt of an unsaturated monocarboxylic
acid. All Examples use blends of Surlyn (Registered Trade Mark) which are
ethylene-methacrylic acid copolymers.JP - 1987 - 63468 discloses a mixed ion golfball blend having low degrees of
neutralisation by divalent cations and high melt index precursors.US 4 911 451 discloses analogous blends but using ethylene-acrylic acid
copolymers. The sodium ionomer is derived from a copolymer which contains 11
wt% of acrylic acid and is neutralised to about 40%. The zinc ionomer is derived
from a copolymer having from 11 to 16% of acrylic acid neutralised to an extent of
from 10 to 40%. A series of Escor (Registered Trade Mark) materials are used 
which have an appropriate melt index. The overall degree of neutralisation
provided by zinc is less than 23%. No extrusion process is disclosed.EP 443 706 also discloses blends of ethylene-acrylic acid ionomers made using
cations of both sodium and zinc. The total neutralisation degree is from 30 to
60%, with at least 10 wt% neutralised by divalent metal ions. In EP 443 706 the
melt index of the cross-linked ionomer is from 0.5 to 5.0 g/10 min. Before
neutralisation the precursor has a melt index of from 20 to 150 g/10 min.
Neutralisation with individual ions is also specified at from 20 to 70% of the
carboxyl groups with alkali metal ions. For the ionomer neutralised with a divalent
metal ion, the neutralisation is from 25 to 70 mol% of the carboxyl groups. A
broad range of blend ratios (from 80/20 to 30/70) is disclosed. Stiffness is also
stated to be a significant performance
