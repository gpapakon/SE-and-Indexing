<ABSTRACT>
The connector according to the invention is in the form of a conventional electrical connector in which at least one of the pins for connecting the female-type connection element is replaced by a first fluid connection sleeve, whereas the corresponding male pin of the second connection element (1) is replaced by a second fluid connection sleeve (34), one of the said sleeves being of the male type and the other of the female type and the male sleeve (34) being designed so as to be able to engage, in a sealed manner, in the female sleeve at the same time as the male electrical connection pins (26, 29) engage in the female connection pins (sockets). The invention applies especially to the connection of electropneumatic devices.

An electrofluidic mixed connector, of the type
comprising two connection elements (1, 2) susceptible

of coupling with one another and each comprising a seat
(3, 4) of insulating material having two sides (16, 17

- 18, 19) parallel and completely passed through by a
plurality of bores (5 to 10) angled perpendicularly to

said sides, the bores of the two insulating seats (3,
4) being capable of receiving respectively pin-type

electric connection prongs (26, 29) and socket-type
electric connection prongs (27, 48), in such a way

that, at the time of coupling, the pin prongs (26, 29)
of one of said two seats (3, 4) can fit into the socket

prongs (27, 48) of the other seat, at least a first
bore (5, 7) of said bores (5 to 10) of each insulating

seat (3, 4) being capable of receiving indifferently an
electric (29, 48) or fluidic (34, 55) connection pro
ng,
said fluidic connection prong consisting of a tubular

pin or socket coupling, said pin coupling (34) having a
cylindrical front portion (37) susceptible of fitting

into a coaxial bore (57) provided in the front part
(56) of said socket coupling (55),

characterized in that it has the shape and structure of
a standard conventional electric connector for multipurpose

use, and in that said first bore (5, 7) of each
seat is also capable of receiving indifferently a pin

or socket-type prong, each of the electric and fluidic
prongs (29, 48 and 34, 55) being axially and removably

blocked in both directions in its bore, by autonomous
securing means carried by the prong which engage with

corresponding conformations of each insulating seat (3,
4), the front portion (37) of the fluidic pin prong

supporting an annular packing (39) intended to fit into
the bore (57) of the socket coupling (55) in order to 

ensure tightness between the two couplings in the
coupled position.
The connector as claimed in claim 1,
characterized in that said securing means for securing

the prongs (29, 34, 48, 55) into the insulating parts
(3, 4) comprises an axial stop means (32, 51) in one

direction and an annular groove. (36, 50) fitted with an
elastic means (31, 50') allowing axial sliding in said

first direction and ensuring a releasable axial
blocking in the other direction.
The connector as claimed in claim 2,
characterized in that said axial stop means is provided

in a front part of said prongs (29, 34, 48, 55) in
order to ensure axial blocking in the direction of

coupling, whereas said annular groove (36, 50) is
provided in a rear part of said prongs.
The connector as claimed in claim 2,
characterized in that said elastic means comprises an

elastic conical washer (90) of which the outer edges
bear against the rear side (98, 99) of said insulating

pieces (93, 94).
The connector as claimed in one of the
preceding claims, characterized in that the securing

means (81) enables dismounting of said prongs (29, 34,
48, 55) from said insulating parts (3, 4).
The connector as claimed in one of the
preceding claims, characterized in that said insulating

parts (93, 94) have a same minimum thickness, and in
that the bores (92) of said socket prongs (101' to

104') extend substantially through the entire width of
said insulating parts.
The connector as claimed in one of the
preceding claims, characterized in that said two parts

(3, 4) in insulating material are respectively fitted
into and secured inside two tubular-shaped supporting 

structures (12, 13) that can fit snugly into one
another to ensure guidance of the prongs (24, 29 - 27,

48) and/or couplings (34, 55) during connection.
The connector as claimed in claim 7,
characterized in that said two tubular structures (12,

13) are provided with securing and/or polarizing means.
The connector as claimed in claim 8,
characterized in that the polarizing means consists of

a conformation of the parts of the tubular structures
(12, 13) which fit into one another.
The connector as claimed in one of the
preceding claims, characterized in that said pin type

fluidic connection coupling (34) is passed through by
an axial channel and comprises a cylindrical central

part (35) of substantially the same diameter as the
bore (5) of the seat into which it fits, a front

portion (37) provided with at least an annular groove
intended to receive an O-ring tightness seal, and a

rear portion (40) constituting a tight connection piece
for a flexible conduit, and in that said socket type

fluidic coupling (55) is passed through by an axial
channel and comprises a tubular portion (56) housed in

the bore (7) of said seat (4) and provided with a
cylindrical bore of diameter equal to that of the front

part of said pin type coupling (34), said bore opening
out in a front side of said seat (4) of said socket

connection element, and a rear part (58) which
protrudes from the rear side (19) of said seat which

constitutes a tight connection piece for flexible
conduits (60).
