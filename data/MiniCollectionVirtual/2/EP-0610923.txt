<ABSTRACT>
No rubbing treatment is done on a pair of transparent 
substrates (1,2). A liquid crystal layer is sandwiched between 

these transparent substrates to exhibit a multi-domain 
structure wherein liquid crystal molecules are oriented randomly in 

various directions 
at the surface of the substrate. Macroscopically, liquid crystal 

molecules are oriented omni-directionally at each 
direction with an equal probability 

in a plane parallel to the transparent substrate. 
The transparent substrates constitute a liquid crystal display 

cell having a reference direction (V) such as an observation 
direction. A pair of polarizers (11,12) are disposed outside the 

transparent substrates to have a transmission or an absorption 
axis (P₁,P₂) aligned with the observation direction (V).

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a liquid crystal display
and a manufacturing method thereof, and more particularly to
a liquid crystal display and a manufacturing method thereof
capable of improving the visual angle.In a liquid crystal display or a liquid crystal
cell, the orientation of liquid crystal molecules is changed
from one particular state to other different state by some
external action. The change in the optical property caused by
the change of orientation of the liquid crystal molecules is
utilized as a visual change in a display. Usually, the
external action is application of an electric field. For
orientating liquid crystal molecules in a particular state in
the absence of an electric field, the surfaces of the glass
substrates which sandwich a liquid crystal layer are usually
subjected to orientation treatment.In conventional liquid crystal cell of twisted
nematic (TN) type, the orientation treatment is achieved by
rubbing the glass substrates, which sandwich a liquid crystal
layer, with a cloth or the like in one direction, i.e. so-called 
rubbing treatment.A pair of substrates are assembled in such a way
that the rubbing directions of the upper and lower substrates
are orthogonal to each other. A liquid crystal cell filled
with liquid crystal material is sandwiched between a pair of
linear polarizers. When the liquid crystal cell is of
negative display type, parallel polarizers are disposed,
interposing the liquid crystal cell, in such a way that one of
the rubbing directions is parallel to the polarization axis of
the neighboring polarizer. In the case of positive display,
crossed polarizers are disposed, interposing the liquid
crystal cell, in such a way that the polarization axes are
parallel to the rubbing direction of the neighboring
substrate.When orientation treatment is done by rubbing as
stated above, orientated direction of the liquid crystal
molecules become uniform on the substrate surface. Then,
there occurs angular dependency of the display that when the
display is viewed by an observer, there exists a particular
angular range in which the display can not be easily observed.Fig.4A shows an example of equi-contrast curves
representing the visual angle characteristics of a TN type
liquid crystal cell. In Fig.4A, the normal direction to the
liquid crystal cell is taken as  = Ø, and the polar angle 
from the normal, is shown radially with  = Ø at the center.
The direction in the horizontal plane (substrate surface) is 
represented by the azimuthal angle . These definitions are
