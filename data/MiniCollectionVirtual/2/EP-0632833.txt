<DESCRIPTION>
 COMPOSITIONS AND METHODS FOR PACE 4 AND 4.1 GENE AND POLYPEPTIDES IN CELLSBACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION 1. Field of the DisclosureThis invention relates generally to proteins and their production in recombinant host cells. More particularly, it relates to polynucleotide sequences that encode novel paired basic amino acid converting enzymes (generically referred to as "PACE," with the two new enzymes being PACE 4 and 4.1), to the production of PACE 4 and 4.1 in transformed cells, and to compositions comprising the PACE 4 and 4.1 enzymes.Materials and methods are also provided for the production of mature forms of proteins from heterologous precursor polypeptides using PACE 4 or 4.1, which are expressed in recombinant host cells.2. Description of Related ArtMany eukaryotic proteins synthesized in bacteria fold incorrectly and, consequently, exhibit low specific activities. Post-translational proteolysis is a common mechanism required for the synthesis of biologically active proteins and peptides in all eukaryotes examined, including yeast (R.S. Fuller et al., (1988), Ann. Rev. Phvsiol. 50:345), invertebrates (R.H, Scheller et al. (1983), Cell 32:7), and mammalian cells (J. Douglass et al. (1984), Ann. Rev. Biochem. 53:665: W.S. Sossin et al. (1989), Neuron 2, 1407).One of the early events in precursor protein maturation is endoproteolysis at the carboxyl side of pairs of basic amino acid sequences (e.g. -LysArg- and -ArgArg-). This kind of endoproteolytic cleavage was initially infeιτed from the sequences of several endocrine and neuroendocrine precursor proteins and was first proposed from studies of proinsulin (D.F. Steiner et al. (1968), Science 157:697; R.E. Chance et al. (1968), Science 161:165) and the ACTH/β-endorphin precursor, proopiomelanocortin (POMCXM. Chretien and CH. Li (1967), Can. J. Biochem. 45:1163). Subsequent studies have revealed a broad spectrum of precursor proteins that requireSUBSTITUTE SHEET 

endoproteolysis at pairs of basic amino acids to yield mature peptides including serum factors (A.K. Bentley et al. (1986), Cell 45:343), viral proteins (CM. Rice et al.(1986), Virology 151:1; CM. Rice et al. (1985), Science 229:726; J.M. McCune et al.(1988), CeU 53:55), growth factors (L.E. Gentry et al- (1988). Mol. Cell Biol. 8:4162: K. Sharpies et a (1987), DNA 6:239; M. Yanagisawa et al. (1988), Nature 332:411: and Gray et al. (1983), Nature 303:722) and receptors (Y. Yosimasa (1988), Science240:784).Several candidate enzymes that are capable of cleaving at single or paired basic
