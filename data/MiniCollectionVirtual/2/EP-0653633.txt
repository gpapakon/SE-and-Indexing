<ABSTRACT>
A toxicity testing assay wherein a test sample is 
prepared with electrochromic dye and a living organism of 

the cladoceran order or other test organisms, and the 
sample is irradiated with alternately blue and yellow 

light to excite fluorescence. The successive groups of 
fluorescent emissions are then viewed at 90° by a 

photomultiplier which develops equivalent alternate count 
outputs, and the count output is amplified and processed 

to develop data indicating (1) membrane potential of 
cells of the living organisms and (2) the total dye 

fluorescence which provides indication of deleterious 
effects to the organisms.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates generally to aquatic toxicity
testing and, more particularly, but not by way of
limitation, it relates to improvements in both method and
apparatus for toxicity testing liquid samples by
quantifying the effects of the subject sample on Daphnia
sp. or other aquatic species.The prior art includes several types of testing
methods for determining aquatic toxicity, and in most
cases the prior methods attempt to derive a quantifiable
result for instance WO-A-90/12886. A system known as chronic Whole Effluent
Toxicity (WET) test is a relatively economical toxicity
testing system that uses EPA-approved methods and test
organisms; however, such a system has very limited
portability and requires seven days to perform a single
test. This biological test method uses representative
organisms to estimate the effects of effluents discharged
or receiving waters on the eco system.Another assay system known as the MICROTOX® Toxicity
Test utilizes the luminescent marine microorganisms which
are altered as to light emission by changes in their
metabolic processes. Reduction of light is proportional
to toxicity of the sample. A testing reagent containing
the microorganisms is freeze-dried for storage and is
readily reconstituted for testing in a very short time.
Finally, a toxicity test known as the IQ Test Kit™
provides a low price test system but one that does not 
produce quantifiable results. This test requires initial
preparation of the test sample with organisms for
subsequent irradiation in ultraviolet light (longwave).
Acquired test data is then interpreted by means of other
conventional assay methods.The present invention relates to an improved type of
toxicity test system that is able to rapidly produce
quantitative/qualitative results. The present system is
commercially termed "DAPHNIAQUANT™" and the system is
designed to evaluate the deleterious effects on a
selected organism(s) exposed to toxic substances such as
impure water, sludge and the like. The condition of the
organism will be reflected in the short-term alterations
in the health of the cells that comprise the organism.
The assay system functions to evaluate the membrane
potential of cells of the affected organisms by using a
voltage-sensitive dye, i.e., electrochromic, to optically
transduce the membrane potential into fluorescent
emissions. The fluorescent emissions are then
photoelectrically detected and processed for input into
an associated computer that is programmed to provide
output of the requisite response in the form of
q

<CLAIMS>
A method for rapid toxicity testing of a liquid sample, comprising:

placing a liquid test sample in a transparent cuvette;
adding an amount of the electrochromic dye Di-4-ANEPPS or Di-8-ANEPPS
which is a dialkylaminostyrl pyridinium sulfonate dye, to said liquid test

sample;
adding a plurality of living organisms having a membrane potential and being
of the Daphnia species including 
Daphnia magna, Ceriodaphnia dubia,

Ceriodaphnia affinis,
 and 
Daphnia pulex
 to the test sample; periodically
illuminating the cuvette with blue light having a pass band centred at 470

nanometres wavelength;
periodically and alternately illuminating the cuvette with yellow light having
a pass band centred at 580 nanometres wavelength;
detecting a first fluorescence emitted at 620 nanometres wavelength in
response to blue light as a measure of living organisms' membrane potential;

detecting a second fluorescence emitted at 620 nanometres wavelength in
response to yellow light as a measure of total dye fluorescence;
determining the respective first and second fluorescences emitted and
assigning them values; and
indicating the detected first and second fluorescence values as a ratio over a
predetermined time interval and observing a change in said ratio as a measure

of the toxicity of the liquid sample.
A method according to Claim 1, wherein illumination of the cuvette is ceased
during periods between the blue light and yellow light illuminations to allow

detection of a dark current indication for use in background correction of the
respective first and second fluorescence values. 
A method according to claim 1 or 2, wherein said
Di-4-ANEPPS or said Di-8-ANEPPS is added to the liquid test

sample at a concentration of approximately 1 milligram per
litre.
