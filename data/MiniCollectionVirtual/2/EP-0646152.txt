<ABSTRACT>
According to the present invention there are obtained improved laminate structures comprising a substrate layer of a thermoplastic resin and a layer of cross-linked carbonate polymer on one or more surface areas. These structures have an excellent combination of properties, particulary in the areas of abrasion resistance, adhesion of the layers, weatherability (resistance to UV radiation, humidity, temperature), solvent resistance, hardness, impact strength, color, thermoformability, ignition resistance and recyclability of the article and scrap formed. In a preferred embodiment, the cross-linking in the cross-linked carbonate polymer layer is provided by cross-linking moieties, preferably arylcyclobutene moieties, which are terminally located relative to the precross-linked carbonate polymer molecule chains. In general, the cross-linked carbonate polymer layer is required to have a sufficiently high degree of cross-linking and to have sufficiently stable cross-links to provide the necessary abrasion resistance and other properties. The cross-link density of the cross-linked carbonate polymer layer should be such that the percent increase in the polymer Tg after cross-linking (% DELTA Tg) is greater than 17 percent.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to laminate structures comprising a thermoplastic core layer
or section and a crosslinked carbonate polymer on one or more surfaces. These structures have
an excellent combination of properties, particularly in the areas of abrasion resistance,
adhesion of the layers, weatherability (resistance to UV radiation, humidity, temperature),
solvent resistance, hardness, impact strength, color, thermoformability, ignition resistance and
ability to recycle the articles and scrap formed.Laminate or layered structures of various types are well known. Often times an
abrasion resistant coating is employed at the surface to protect inner layers that are somewhat
susceptible to abrasion but have other desirable traits. Typical examples of these prior art
structures include structures based on one or more carbonate polymer core layers and having
coatings composed of crosslinked polyacrylate or polysiloxane.The polysiloxane compositions typically used for abrasion resistant coatings are
thermoset organopolysiloxanes filled with colloidal silica particles. Examples of these coatings
are disclosed in U.S. Patent Nos. 4,159,206, 4,410,594, and 4,914,143.In attempting to employ these types of compositions in abrasion resistant layers,
particularly in carbonate polymer structures, primer layers are usually necessary to promote the
adhesion of the polysiloxane coating. Typical primers include thermoset or thermoplastic
acrylic polymers. While the polysiloxane coatings usually provide acceptable abrasion
resistance, they suffer from a number of disadvantages including poor adhesion, insufficient
weatherability, lack of thermoformability, and expensive lacquer coating application methods.
It is also found that these surface layers and/or laminate structures oftentimes are not
recyclable and the scrap from the production process or subsequent shaping steps cannot be
reused. Another frequent disadvantage is that the solvents which are often employed in these
lacquer coating formulations may not be environmentally acceptable.It is also known that these existing coating materials for thermoplastic resins are
often not able to be matched well to the substrate in terms of chemical compositions and
modulus. By chemical composition matching is meant using a coating composition that is as
compatible as possible with the substrate, the degree of compatibility being measured by the
difference in solubility parameters of the compositions. Matching the modulus (stiffness)
properties of the two compositions used for
