<ABSTRACT>
A power storage type recoil starter used for, for 
example, an engine of a lawn mower including spiral springs that 

are wound when a starter rope of a recoil pulley is pulled to 
rotate the starter wheel of the engine. The spiral spring is 

coiled up by a repeated pulling action of the starter rope and 
then suddenly recoiled by releasing a locking mechanism, thus 

rotating the main shaft of the engine powerfully to start the 
engine.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a power storage 
type recoil starter for facilitating the start of internal 
combustion engines. Small internal combustion engines are equipped 
with a recoil starter, and the starting of the engine is 
accomplished by pulling a starter rope that is recoiled. In such recoil starters, a certain amount of 
experience is necessary to start the engine. The trick is to 
pull the starter rope strongly at the time the air in the 
cylinder of the engine is compressed immediately prior to the 
firing of the plug. However, this operation is not skillfully 
performed by inexperienced persons and people who have limited 
strength. These people tend to pull the starter rope with an 
uneven strength and at a relatively slow speed. The result is 
that the spark of the plug is small, and ignition does not easily 
occur. Especially in recent engines equipped with electronic 
ignition devices, the spark is small, and starting is not easy. The problem can be solved by an engine equipped 
with a starter motor. However, this motor is expensive and 
increases the weight of the engine. Especially for garden 
equipment which is carried and operated with the engine mounted  
 
thereon, such a weight increase is not welcome. In addition, 
there are also problems in terms of power consumption. A first prior document US-A-3140703 relates to a mechanical 
device for starting a small internal combustion engine in 
which the engine rewinds a starter spring to a predetermined 
tension as the engine operates. Another prior document, 
US-A-3306277 relates to a spring starter for an internal 
combustion engine in which a first pull of the starter rope 
tensions a spring against compression of the engine and a 
further pull on the rope adds to the stored energy of the 
spring to turn the engine over. Yet another prior document 
US-A-3861374 relates to a recoil-type starter in which pulling 
on a starter cord directly turns a starter shaft. It is an object of the present invention to at least partly 
mitigate the problems described above. More specifically, in use of embodiments of the present 
invention, power is stored in a recoil starter via flat spiral 
springs, and at the time of starting, the stored power is 
released all at once so that the starter is rotated at a high 
speed to start the engine. According to a first aspect of the present invention there is 
provided a power storage type recoil starter comprising a 
starter wheel which is attached to a main shaft of an engine; 
and a recoil pulley
</DESCRIPTION>
<CLAIMS>
A power storage type recoil starter comprising: 

a starter wheel (14) which is attached to a main shaft 
(12) of an engine; and 
a recoil pulley (18) and a mechanism for coupling the 
recoil pulley to the starter wheel so as to rotate said 

starter wheel in a starting direction, characterised in that 
the mechanism for coupling comprises: 
a first drum (26) which is rotated by said recoil pulley 
in a direction opposite from said starting direction; 
a second drum (36) which is coupled to said first drum so 
as to be rotated; 
a speed reduction mechanism (40) which is installed 
between said recoil pulley and said first drum; 
a clutch mechanism (28) which makes and releases a 
coupling between said first drum (26) and said second drum 

(36); 
a flat spiral spring (32) which is installed between said 
second drum (36) and an outside element (30), said flat spiral 

spring (32) being wound out of said outside element by a 
rotation of said second drum (36) in a direction opposite to 

said starting direction so that a rewinding force of said 
spring is stored in said second drum as a rotational force in 

said starting direction; 
a locking mechanism (34) which restrains a rotation of 
said second drum in said starting direction; and 
a release mechanism (50) which releases said locking 
mechanism (34) and disengages said clutch mechanism (28) 

simultaneously. 
A power storage type recoil starter comprising: 

a starter wheel (14) which is attached to a main shaft 
(12) of an engine; and 
a recoil pulley (18) and a mechanism for coupling the 
recoil pulley to the starter wheel so as to rotate said  

 
starter wheel in a starting direction, characterised in that 

the mechanism for coupling comprises:- 

a first drum (26) which is rotated by said recoil pulley 

(18) in a direction opposite from said starting direction; 
a second drum (36) which is coupled to said first drum 
(28) so as to be rotated; 
a speed reduction mechanism (40) which is installed 
between said recoil pulley (18) and said first drum (26); 
a one-way clutch mechanism (60) which allows a rotation 
of said first drum in said starting direction and restrains a 

rotation of said first drum in a direction opposite to said 
starting direction; and 
a flat spiral spring (32) which is installed between said 
first drum (26) and said second drum (36), said flat spiral 

spring (32) being wound by a rotation of said first drum in a 
direction of said starting direction so that a rewinding force 

of said spring is stored in said second drum as a rotational 
force in said starting direction; 
a locking mechanism (34) which restrains a rotation of 
said second drum in said starting direction; and 
a release mechanism (50) which releases said locking 
mechanism and disengages said clutch mechanism simultaneously. 
A power storage type recoil starter according to any 
preceding claim, further comprising: a rotating block (46) 

which is provided on said second drum (36) so as to rotate 
said starter wheel (14), said rotating block being provided in 

a manner of making a relative rotation for a prescribed angle 
with respect to said second drum; and shock-absorbing members 

which are interposed in contact areas between said second drum 
and said rotating block. 
A power storage type recoil starter according to claim 2  
 

and 3, wherein said first drum is provided with an anchoring 
projection (68) on an outside circumference of said first 

drum, and said flat spiral spring (32) is provided with an 
anchoring hole (70) at one end of said spiral spring so that 

said spiral spring is connected to said first drum via said 
anchoring projection engaged with said anchoring hole, said 

anchoring projection (68) being formed in a peak-shape so that 
said peak-shape anchoring projection engages with said 

anchoring hole when said first drum is rotated in a direction 
that tightens said flat spiral spring (32) and so that said 

peak-shaped anchoring projection (68) is disengaged from said 
anchoring hole when said first drum is rotated in a direction 

that relaxes said flat spiral spring.
