<ABSTRACT>
An ear piece device (10) configured for being supported in the ear and providing a microphone (17) which primarily detects only sounds originated by the user is contained within a housing (11) which is configured at one end to fit snugly at the ear canal of the user, but not to extend within the ear canal. A microphone element (18) is coupled within the housing in a position such that the microphone element is separated from contact with the skull of the user by the housing. This microphone element (18) is contained within a casement (25) which is mechanically and acoustically isolated from vibrations occurring within the housing.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention pertains to an ear piece device according to the preamble of claim 1
Such a device is known from U.S. Patent 4,588,867. The inventive
microphone/speaker
combination picks up speech vibrations on a
unidirectional basis and develops an isolated signal for
audio processing which deletes background audio signal.
More particularly, the present invention relates to an
ear mounted microphone/speaker combination responsive to
speech from the user which is substantially isolated
from surrounding background noise and which can be used
in duplex without occurrence of feedback.The emergence of computer based control systems for
virtually every aspect of daily living has re-emphasized
the need for an inexpensive system for providing direct
voice command capability. At present, most computer
systems rely on keyboard input to provide data and
processing instructions. This is not only time
consuming and limiting in view of physical requirements
of being seated with both hands on a key pad, but it
limits the efficiency of data input to the typing speed
of the user. Indeed, compared with the advanced degree
of sophistication of current computer systems, this
dominant data entry method of imputing instructions one
letter or number at a time seems almost archaic.This is not to say that the development of voice
activated input systems has been ignored. There has
clearly been a long recognized need for implementation
of a method of voice command which would obviate the
keyboard as a computer input device. Numerous problems
have remained unsolved, however, and continue to place
voice activated systems beyond the financial reach of
the general marketplace. For example, the typical level
of confidence in voice recognition for commercial
software is between 45 to 60%. At this rate, the system
is averaging only one out of two words with correct 
identification. This is hardly adequate for general
application. This confidence level is even less when
environmental factors are introduced such as background
noise, mobility of the user and other unpredictable
variables that modify the audio signal being received at
the computer.In typical applications for voice activated
systems, one might expect a telephone to ring during
dictation, an interruption to occur by another voice
having a different voice pattern, the sounding of a
horn, clock alarm, or any of thousands of extraneous
background noises. Even the shifting of position of the
speaking individual can modify the audio signal enough
to confuse the computer
