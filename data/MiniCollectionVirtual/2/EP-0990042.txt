Such compositions may be useful for the treatment or prevention or for diagnosing of vascular diseases. 

In the field of neuroscience and medical therapy, there is a great demand for test systems to study the function and interaction of gene products, the malfunction or expression of which cause vascular and/or tumorous diseases. Such systems would also be suitable for drug development against such diseases. A prominent example for such diseases are diseases which develop from cells in tissues that are faced with low oxygen tension under certain physiological (embryogenesis) as well as pathological (tumor growth, wound healing) conditions. The compensatory mechanisms that enable these cells to survive hypoxic conditions involve activation and repression of certain
