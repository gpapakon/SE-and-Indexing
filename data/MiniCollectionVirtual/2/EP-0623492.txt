<ABSTRACT>
The rollover protection comprises an approximately U-shaped rollover bar (5) which can be moved in a translatory manner from bottom to top and back again and, with its downwardly directed legs (6), is guided in a housing (4) by way of guide elements (10, 14, 16, 20, 38). By virtue of the action of springs (7), the rollover bar (5) can be rapidly transferred from its rest position, in which it projects beyond the top rim of the vehicle to virtually no extent at all, into a supporting position in which it projects upwards beyond the top rim of the vehicle to a considerable extent. In order, over all, to reduce the weight - both of the encased parts and of the encased ejecting springs - almost all the parts of the rollover device, at least the legs (6) of the rollover bar (5) and the guide elements (10, 14, 16, 20, 38), are produced from extruded profiles.

A roll bar protection system for a motor vehicle, especially for a
convertible, with an approximately U-shaped roll bar (5) which can be

moved in an at least virtually translatory manner from a sunken resting
position into an upwardly-projecting supporting position above the

uppermost surface of the vehicle and back again, with the downwardly-directed
limbs (6) of the said roll bar (5) guided through guide elements

and with the roll bar (5) in a resting position held by a releasable holding
device and displaceable upwardly from this position and fixable in an

upper position, wherein the guide elements (14, 16, 20) are arranged on a
housing (4) which can be secured to an approximately vertical vehicle

wall (1) and comprising two vertical tubes (14) secured at their lower
ends to the housing (4) with coil springs (7) arranged within them,

characterised in that at least the limbs of the roll bar (5) and the guide
elements (14, 16, 20) are extruded sections and that the roll bar (5) can

be displaced upwardly solely through the coil springs (7) arranged within
the vertical tubes (14), which envelop a spring guiding bolt (38) which

has a thrust washer (39) at the upper end, wherein the roll bar (5) can be
fixed in the upper position via a locking device (25, 41).
A device according to claim 1,

characterised in that the vertical tubes (14) are held at their upper ends via
a transverse plate (16) arranged on the housing (4), with the said

transverse plate (16) bearing two receiving bushes (18) for the vertical
tubes (14) via a connection web (17).
A device according to claim 2,

characterised in that the limbs (6) of the roll bar (5) are provided on their
side facing the transverse plate (16) with elongate slits (19) for the

through-passage of the connecting webs (17).
A device according to claim 1,

characterised in that the lower ends of the limbs (6) are connected to one
another by a cross-member (20).
A device according to claim 4,

characterised in that the cross-member (20) comprises an extruded section
and is provided with receiving bushes (22) at both ends of a transverse

web (21) which envelop the limb ends.
A device according to claim 5,

characterised in that vertical projections (23) are provided on the transverse
web (21) for the mounting of a spring-loaded detent pawl (25).
A device according to claim 1,

characterised in that the vertical tubes (14) are enveloped at the bottom by

centring cones (36) which are braced through springs (37) against the 
housing bottom (10).
A device according to claim 2,

characterised in that the vertical tubes (14) are provided above and beneath
the receiving bushes (18) of the transverse plate (16) externally with guide

bushes (40) for the limbs (6) of the roll bar (5).
A device according to claim 1,

characterised in that the limbs (6) of the roll bar (5) have an elongate cross-section.
A device according to claim 9,

characterised in that the limbs (6) have an approximately oval external
shape in cross-section.
A device according to claim 9 or claim 10,

characterised in that the inner wall of the limbs (6) is approximately oval in
cross-section.
