<ABSTRACT>
A DNA analyzing method which bonds the oligomer of 
the known base sequence to the DNA fragment obtained 

by digesting sample 1 with restrictive enzyme, causes 
hybridization between oligomer 3 and DNA fragment 

using the oligomers 3 which have the sequences of all 
combinations of the types of the bases within the 

length of several bases following the known base 
sequence, checks presence or absence of the 

hybridization or complementary DNA strand extension, 
identifies the DNA fragment terminal sequence from 

this result, and fractionates the DNA fragments and 
analyzes them or analyzes them as they are. This DNA 

analyzing method provides an effective analysis of 
mixtures of long DNAs or DNA fragments.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to the DNA analyzing
method including DNA sequencing.Conventional DNA sequencing of large DNA (e.g. 105
to 106 (100 K to 1 M) base length) requires subcloning
processes. In the subcloning processes, the target
DNA is digested with restriction enzymes to produce
fragments of the target DNA. The fragments are cloned
in a plasmid, which is used as a vector in the cloning
process. E. Coli infected with the plasmid is
cultured in the agar thereafter. As only infected E.
Coli can survive and make colony in the agar, we can
select E. Coli infected with the plasmid by picking up
the colonies. Then the target DNA fragments subcloned
in the plasmid are extracted from E. Coli. The
extracted target DNA fragments are sequenced. Then
the target DNA fragments are taken separately by
picking up obtained colonies, respectively. DNA
sequencing has been carried out for each colony using
the plasmid containing the DNA fragment taken
separately. Normally, 300 to 500 DNA bases can be
determined by one sequencing operation, and sequencing
of 1 mega (106) bases requires analysis of 2000 or 
more colonies. Furthermore, the colonies containing
same DNA fragments may be picked up for the analysis;
this requires the colonies in the number of several
times 2,000, namely, close to 10,000 colonies to be
picked up for analysis.According to the conventional method, base
sequencing for human genome and other creatures,
genome requires digesting of a great length of DNA by
restriction enzymes and subcloning of the digested DNA
into vectors such as plasmid and yeast clomosomes,
thereby forming a colony derived from one containing
one DNA digested product and selecting each DNA
fragment by picking up the colony. Then DNA fragments
have been amplified by culturing such microbe
obtained from one colony to obtain a great amount of
the DNA fragment required for base sequencing
operation. Called "cloning or subcloning", this
biological technique has disadvantages of taking a lot
of time for culturing and is unfitted for automation.
Such conventional techniques are discussed in
Molecular Cloning, A Laboratory Manual (2nd Version)
(Chapters 1 to 4 and Chapter 9, Cold spring Harbor
Laboratory Press, 1989).According to the above technique, single DNA
fragment species required for sequencing operation has 
been prepared biologically using vectors and infected
colibacillus and yeast. This method requires the use
of a special facility called P2. Another disadvantage
of this method is to take a long time to culture the
micr
