<ABSTRACT>
In one aspect, the present invention concerns a process of making coated magnetic particles. According to this process, an aqueous sol of amorphous, hydrolyzed, aluminous, colloidal particles is mixed with an aqueous suspension comprising magnetic particles. The amorphous, hydrolyzed, aluminous, colloidal particles have a mean particle size in the range from about 0.5 to about 5 nanometers and an average degree of hydrolysis in the range from 1.5 to about 3. During mixing, the amorphous, hydrolyzed, aluminous, colloidal particles form a continuous, amorphous, aluminum hydrous oxide coating on the magnetic particles, wherein the coating has an average thickness in the range from about 0.5 to about 5 nanometers. The present invention also concerns coated magnetic particles. Coated magnetic particles according to the present invention comprise a magnetizable core and a continuous, amorphous, aluminum hydrous oxide coating formed on the magnetizable core. The coating has an average thickness in the range from about 0.5 to about 5 nanometers. In another aspect, the present invention concerns a magnetic recording medium comprising a magnetic layer formed on a nonmagnetizable support. The magnetic layer comprises the coated magnetic particles described above dispersed in a polymeric binder.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to novel 
magnetic particles having improved dispersibility and 
orientability characteristics. More particularly, the 
present invention concerns novel magnetic particles 
which are coated with a continuous, amorphous, aluminum 
hydrous oxide coating. The present invention also 
concerns methods of making these coated magnetic 
particles as well as magnetic recording media 
incorporating such particles. Magnetic recording media generally comprise a 
magnetic layer coated on at least one side of a 
nonmagnetizable support. For particulate magnetic 
recording media, the magnetic layer comprises magnetic 
particles dispersed in a polymeric binder. The 
magnetic layer may also include other components such 
as lubricants; abrasives; thermal stabilizers; 
antioxidants; dispersants; wetting agents; antistatic 
agents; fungicides; bactericides; surfactants; coating 
aids; nonmagnetic particles; and the like. The magnetic layer of a majority of 
conventional magnetic recording media is prepared by 
combining the magnetic particles, the polymeric binder, 
and other components (if any) with an organic solvent 
to form a dispersion. The dispersion is generally 
homogenized by lengthy mechanical milling to break up 
agglomerates of, and disperse, the magnetic particles.  
 
The resulting dispersion is then coated onto the 
nonmagnetizable support. The magnetic particles may 
then be magnetically oriented after which the coating 
may be dried, calendered, and/or cured. The quality of the dispersion plays a vital 
role in determining the electromagnetic performance of 
the resulting magnetic recording medium. If the 
magnetic particles are insufficiently dispersed in the 
polymeric binder and other ingredients of the 
dispersion, electromagnetic and physical properties of 
the magnetic layer, such as the signal to noise ratio, 
squareness ratio, ability to reproduce short 
wavelengths, magnetic particle packing density, Young's 
modulus, surface smoothness, abrasion resistance, 
durability, and the like, tend to suffer dramatically. Uniform dispersion of magnetic particles in 
the dispersion is very difficult to achieve, 
particularly when extremely fine, platelet-shaped 
magnetic particles, e.g., barium ferrite particles, are 
used. Organic dispersing agents have been used to 
facilitate the dispersing of the magnetic particles. 
However, due to the magnetic attractive forces between 
magnetic particles, there is a strong tendency for 
magnetic particles to reagglomerate in the
