to be repaired 
machining-off of the cylinder sleeve to a base 
diameter 
degreasing of the cylinder surface 
blasting of the cylinder surface 
preheating of the cylinder surface 
thermal spraying of a coating 
smoothing of the film 
sealing of the film. 
Process according to claim 1, characterised in 
that the whole cylinder sleeve surface is restored. 
Process according to claim 1, characterised in 
that the damaged parts of the cylinder sleeve are 

restored. 
Process according to one of claims 1 to 3, 
characterised in that the cylinder (4, 5) is worked off 

by turning. 
Process according to one of claims 1 to 3, 
characterised in that the cylinder (4, 5) is worked off 

by means of an abrasive blasting process. 
Process according to one of claims 1 to 3,  
 

characterised in that the cylinder (4, 5) is worked off 
by means of grinding. 
Process according to one of claims 1 to 3, 
characterised in that the cylinder (4, 5) is worked off 

by means of milling. 
Process according to one of the preceding claims, 
characterised in that the cylinder (4, 5) is worked off 

by the size of the coating to be carried out. 
Process according to one of the preceding claims, 
characterised in that old coatings on the 

cylinder (4, 5) are removed. 
Process according to claim 9, characterised in 
that the coatings are removed by the water jet process. 
Process according to one of the previous claims, 
characterised in that the coating is carried out by 

means of flame-spraying. 
Process according to one of claims 1 to 10, 
characterised in that the coating is carried out by 

means of plasma spraying. 
Process according to one of claims 1 to 10, 
characterised in that the coating is carried out by 

means of high-speed flame-spraying. 
Process according to one of the previous claims, 
characterised in that the cylinder (4, 5) is coated in 

a thin film process and subsequently smoothed. 
Process according to one of claims 1 to 13, 
characterised in that the cylinder (4, 5) is coated in  

 
a thick film process and subsequently ground to size 

and in the process simultaneously smoothed. 
Device for repairing cylinders of printing 
machines, particularly forme cylinders, by means of 

thermal spray coating, characterised in that a cross 
slide traverse (8) with a longitudinal and a transverse 

support (18, 19) is installed parallel to the axis of 
the cylinder (4, 5) to be repaired on the machine side 

walls (9, 10) of the printing machine, the longitudinal 
support (18) being in engagement with a draw 

spindle (21), the transverse support (19) carrying a 
tool adaptor (20), on which alternative tools for 

repairing the cylinder (4, 5) are applied, and the 
cylinder (4, 5) is in operational connection with a 

drive (65). 
Device according to claim 16, characterised in 
that the cross slide traverse (8) rests on 

ledges (11, 12) secured on the inner sides of the 
machine side walls (9, 10). 
Device according to claim 17, characterised in 
that in an arrangement of the ledges (11, 12) an upper 

cylinder (5) can be processed, as can a lower 
cylinder (4), after rotating the cross slide 

traverse (8) 180Â° around its longitudinal axis and a 
perpendicular axis. 
Device according to one of claims 16 to 18, 
characterised in that for adjustment the cross slide 

traverse (8) has an eccentric (29) in the region of one 

frame receptor effective in the direction of the 
transverse support (19). 
Device according to one of claims 16 to 19,  
 

characterised in that the longitudinal support (18) is 
movable for adjusting the speed and reversing the 

direction.

characterised in that the bearer rings (27, 28) of the 

cylinder (4, 5) are each provided with a cover 42. 
Device according to one of claims 16 to 23, 
characterised in that each cylinder gap (52) is 

provided with a cover. 
Device according to one of claims 16 to 24, 
characterised in that the cylinder (4, 5) is in 

connection with the drive unit of the printing machine. 
Device according to one of claims 16 to 24, 
characterised in that the cylinder (4, 5) is separated
