<ABSTRACT>
An electrical connector (10) for a battery 
terminal (12,14) having a known minimum diameter, 

comprising an electric contact (22) of electrically 
conductive material having a substantially U-shaped 

cross-section defined by a base portion (28) and a 
pair of resilient legs (30) extending away from the 

base portion, the free end of each leg being bent 
inwardly to form an arm (32) which is directed back 

towards the base portion, the pair of arms being 
resilient, spaced apart to define a longitudinally 

extending slot (36) therebetween, and converging such 
that the slot has a predetermined inner width which is 

less than a predetermined outer width, the 
predetermined outer width of the slot being greater 

than the minimum diameter of the battery terminal, and 
the predetermined inner width of the slot being less 

than the minimum diameter of the battery terminal; and 
a housing (44) of electrically insulating material 

which surrounds the electric contact and which has an 
opening adjacent the slot through which the battery 

terminal can pass.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to an electrical connector 
for battery terminals, and in particular to an 
electrical connector for electrically connecting 
terminals having a substantially cylindrical or 
frusto-conical shape. JP-A-04.174.966 discloses an electrical 
connector in accordance with the preamble 
of Claim 1. The charging of batteries, for example, lead-acid 
batteries, during manufacture thereof is usually 
performed at a charging station. At the charging 
station, a plurality of batteries are placed 
substantially adjacent one another in a line with the 
adjacent terminals of adjacent batteries having 
opposite polarity. Adjacent terminals are 
electrically connected together to electrically 
connect the batteries in series, to allow the 
plurality of batteries to be charged at the same time. 
Adjacent terminals are connected by an electrical 
connector comprising a substantially U-shaped copper 
plate in which the arms of the plate are resiliently 
biased away from one another. This type of electrical 
connector is placed in position by squeezing the arms 
together, placing the connector between adjacent 
terminals, and then releasing the arms. The free ends 
of the arms are biased into contact with the adjacent 
terminals. This type of electrical connector has 
several disadvantages. Firstly, the design of the 
connector is such that a point contact is made between 
the connector and the terminals. On charging there is 
a high risk that the terminal will burn, especially if 
any dirt is present. Secondly, this type of connector 
provides no form of protective housing around the 
terminals, thereby exposing the terminals to the 
environment. With lead-acid batteries, presence of 
sulphuric acid can cause blackening of lead terminals 
due to the formation of lead oxide. Further, the use 
of copper is unsuitable as the connector easily  
 
breaks, and in an acid environment, the copper is 
subject to degradation. It is an object of the present invention to 
overcome one or more of the above disadvantages. To this end, an electrical connector in 
accordance with the present invention for a battery 
terminal having a known minimum diameter, comprises an 
electric contact of electrically conductive material 
having a substantially U-shaped cross-section defined 
by a base portion and a pair of resilient legs 
extending away from the base portion, the free end of 
each leg being bent inwardly to form an arm which is 
directed back towards the base portion, the pair of 
arms being resilient, spaced

<CLAIMS>
An electrical connector (10) for a 
battery terminal (12,14) having a known minimum 

diameter, comprising an electric contact (22) of 
electrically conductive material having a 

substantially U-shaped cross-section defined by a base 
portion (28) and a pair of resilient legs (30) 

extending away from the base portion, characterised in that the free end of 
each leg is bent inwardly to form an arm (32) which 

is directed back towards the base portion, the pair of 
arms being resilient, spaced apart to define a 

longitudinally extending slot (36) therebetween, and 
converging such that the slot has a predetermined 

outer width, the predetermined outer width of the slot 
being greater than the minimum diameter of the battery 

terminal, and the predetermined inner width of the 
slot being less than the minimum diameter of the 

battery terminal; and by a housing (44) of electrically 
insulating material which surrounds the electric 

contact and which has an opening (46) adjacent the 
slot through which the battery terminal can pass. 
An electrical connector as claimed in 
Claim 1 comprising two such electrical contacts (22) 

which are electrically connected together and 
substantially aligned in the longitudinal direction of 

the slots, the housing (44) surrounding both electric 
contacts and having a single opening (46) adjacent the 

slots or an opening adjacent each slot. 
An electrical connector as claimed in 
Claim 1 comprising two such electric contacts (80,82) 

which are electrically connected together, each 
electric contact having its own separate housing 

(84,86).  
 
An electrical connector as claimed in 
any one of Claims 1 to 3, wherein the or each electric 

contact (22) is formed in one piece from sheet metal. 
An electrical connector as claimed in 
Claim 4, wherein the or each electric contact (22) is 

formed from stainless steel. 
An electrical connector as claimed in 
any one of Claims 1 to 5, wherein the or each housing 

(44) is moulded from plastics material. 
An electrical connector as claimed in 
Claim 6, wherein the or each housing (104) comprises 

two parts (106,108) which are secured together. 
An electrical connector as claimed in 
Claim 6 or Claim 7, wherein the or each housing 

(44,84,86) has a handle (90,92).
