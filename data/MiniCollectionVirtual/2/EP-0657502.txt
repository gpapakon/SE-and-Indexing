<ABSTRACT>
A thermoplastic composition containing a mixture of (a) a block 
copolyether ester, a block copolyether amide and/or a polyurethane; 

(b) a thermoplastic homo- co- or terpolymer that is incompatible 
with (a); and (c) a compatibilizer; and its use in preparing films is 

disclosed. Such films demonstrate moisture vapor permeability, 
while acting as barriers to liquids and microorganisms.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a thermoplastic composition and its use in 
preparing films demonstrating moisture vapor permeability, while 
acting as barriers to liquids and microorganisms such as viruses and 
bacteria. Such films are found in various articles including wound 
coverings, transdermal patches, operating room drapes, protective 
clothing, diapers, personal hygiene products (feminine hygiene, 
incontinency), waterproof and outdoor clothing articles, food 
packaging, films used in plant growing environments and any end-use 
where it is desirable to combine "breathability" and liquid 
barrier properties. Various thermoplastic materials are known for forming films 
demonstrating both liquid barrier properties and moisture vapor 
permeability. Included among these are copolyether esters, 
copolyether amides and polyurethanes. While films of these 
materials perform well and meet the performance requirements of 
various end uses, a drawbrack they possess is their relative high cost 
in comparison to other thermoplastic materials. It is an object of the present invention to provide a new 
thermoplastic composition and film therefrom possessing desirable 
performance characteristics at a reduced cost. According to the 
invention, a thermoplastic composition is provided containing a 
mixture of (a) a block copolyether ester, a block copolyether amide 
and/or a polyurethane; (b) a thermoplastic homo- co- or terpolymer 
that is incompatible with (a); and (c) a compatibilizer. Component (b) of the composition is a lower cost thermoplastic 
material which has insufficient moisture vapor permeability to be 
suitable for the end-uses previously mentioned. It is incompatible 
with component (a) and, were the two to be combined together and 
formed into a film, such film would have a profile showing long 
laminae or sheets of component (b). Accordingly, films made from  
 
such a composition would have a permeability restricted by the 
specific permeability of component (b), and poor mechanical 
properties, e.g. a tendency to delaminate. According to the present invention, it has been surprisingly found 
that a compatibilizer can be combined with components (a) and (b) to 
yield a film having a moisture vapor transmission rate (MVTR) 
approaching that of the theoretical value calculated as follows:

MVTR theor = (MVTR comp.(a))(weight % comp.(a)) + 
(MVTR comp.(b))(weight % comp.(b)). As used herein, certain terms are defined as follows. "Compatibility" of thermoplastic materials is an art-recognised term 
that
