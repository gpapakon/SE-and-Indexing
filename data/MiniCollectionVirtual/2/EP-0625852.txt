<ABSTRACT>
A video display control system comprises: a video display 
having a wide format display ratio; a letterbox detector (
100) for 
sampling video information in pictures represented by input video 

signals having a letterbox format and generating a control signal 
(LTRBX_BEG) for enlarging the pictures for substantially filling the 

video display means with active video; and, a first control circuit 
(128) for restricting operation of the letterbox detector to a vertical 

range of horizontal lines in each field of the video signal; and, a 
second control circuit (101) for restricting operation of the letterbox 

detector to a horizontal range of video data in each of the horizontal 
lines.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to the field of automatic detectors for
letterbox video sources, for example as would be useful in wide
screen televisions.In "letterbox" format, an image in wide format display ratio,
for example 16 X 9 (also designated 16:9), is displayed across the
full width of a narrower format display ratio medium, for example
4 X 3 (also designated 4:3). Movies in a wide format to be
broadcast commercially without distortion or cropping are
converted by the broadcaster to letterbox format, to enable display
on a conventional receiver screen, for example 4 X 3. The
broadcaster effectively adds blank or matte top and bottom borders,
and broadcasts the combined picture and borders in a 4 X 3
composite image signal. Assuming standard 16 X 9 and 4 X 3
ratios, and standard NTSC signals, only 181 horizontal lines in each
field are devoted to the main video, the remaining lines being the
matte, gray or black borders. The useful picture information, or
main video, is generally referred to as active video, whereas the
borders are generally referred to as inactive video, even if the
borders are flat fields having some luminance value and/or
chrominance component. This distinction and designation is
followed herein. The borders may be used, if at all, to display
different types of auxiliary information. A first type is generally
text, such as storm warnings, news alerts and subtitles. A second
type includes station and network logos, which are often graphic or
a combination of text and graphics. Both types of auxiliary
information might be present together, or separately. Both types of
auxiliary information are also generally referred to as active video.
A third type of auxiliary information which can interfere with
correct identification of a signal in letterbox format is closed
captioning, which is usually transmitted during the vertical blanking
interval.When such letterbox displays (in 4 X 3 format) are shown on a
wide screen television, for example 16 X 9 format, the video signal
can be vertically zoomed, that is enlarged, by a factor which both
increases the portion of active video to substantially fill the wide 
screen display, and at the same time, substantially eliminates the
upper and lower borders. This can be accomplished without
incurring image aspect ratio distortion. It is a useful feature to
automatically detect letterbox sources and vertically enlarge the
active portion of the video source signal so as to substantially fill
the display screen.An automatic letterbox detector in a wide

<CLAIMS>
A video display control system, including:

a video display means (10) having a wide format display ratio, e.g.
16X9;
means (100) responsive to a video signal (Y_IN) for determining when
said video signal has a letterbox format in which a picture is represented by an

active video portion (14) positioned between upper (16) and lower (18) border
areas, said letterbox format picture sometimes having auxiliary information, e.g.

a storm warning or a logo, positioned in different portions of said border areas,
said determining means being operable in a predetermined portion of each field

and comprising :
means (124) operable when said letterbox format is determined for
generating a control signal (LTRBX_BEG, LTRBX_END) enabling said picture

to be enlarged in size to substantially fill said video display means with said
active video portion,

   
characterized in that
 said predetermined portion of each field is likely to
exclude said auxiliary information, when present; and in that said determining

means (100) further comprises :

means (130, 132) for comparing first ("24") and second ("250")

predetermined counts to a running line count (L_COUNT), said line count being
reset for successive fields;
means (134) responsive to said comparing means (130, 132) for
generating an enable signal (VERT_EN) when said running line count

(L_COUNT) is between said first and second predetermined counts, said
control signal generating means (124) being responsive to said enable signal

(VERT_EN) for enabling said picture to be enlarged in size only if
said enable signal (VERT_EN) is generated.
