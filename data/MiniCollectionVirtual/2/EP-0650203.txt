<ABSTRACT>
The hole density of an oxide superconductor having 
holes as carriers is higher than the hole density to bring 

the highest value of the superconductivity critical 
temperature Tc thereof, and it can be made higher than the 

optimal density to bring the highest Tc value by treating 
the oxide superconductor with heat in an oxidizing gas 

atmosphere, or by replacing positive ions constituting the 
oxide superconductor except for copper with ions of a low 

valence number. Accordingly, it is possible to 
substantially reduce the rate of decrease of the critical 

current density owing to an applied magnetic field when the 
magnetic field is applied parallel to the crystal c axis, 

and to allow a current conductor produced by using the oxide 
superconductor to have high critical current density.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an oxide superconductor
and a process of producing the superconductor, and
more particularly, to an oxide superconductor used as a
current conductor, such as a wire, a coil, an interconnector
and the like, and a process of producing the superconductor.The superconductivity critical temperature (Tc) of an
oxide superconductor having holes as carriers is determined
by the hole density thereof. As disclosed in, for example,
Physical Review B, Vol.41, No.10 (1990), p. 6418, Fig. 20,
if the hole density of the oxide superconductor is
higher or lower than the hole density producing the highest
Tc value, Tc drops.The critical current density of the oxide
superconductor increases as the temperature at which the
oxide superconductor is used as a current conductor becomes
lower than Tc. Therefore, it is practically desirable that
Tc be as high as possible. In a conventional oxide
superconductor used as a current conductor or a magnetic
shield of a variation of a current conductor, in order to 
obtain a higher critical current density, the hole density
is controlled so that Tc takes its highest value obtained by
the oxide superconductor as disclosed in, for example, Proc.
of the 51st Scientific Lecture, the Japan Society of Applied
Physics, p. 92, 26p-ZB-8.Furthermore, in order to maintain high critical current
density in the current conductor, it is necessary to orient
the direction of the current flowing in the oxide
superconductor and the crystal c axis perpendicular to each
other. For example, in the case of a superconductive tape,
the surface of the tape is oriented perpendicular to the
crystal c axis.In the above-mentioned oxide superconductor, the
critical current density is lowered by application of a
magnetic field. A conventional oxide superconductor used as
a current conductor has a problem in that the rate of
decrease of the critical current density differs remarkably
according to the application direction of a magnetic field
relative to the crystal orientation. In other words, as
disclosed in, for example, Physica C205, P. 329, Fig. 5,
1993, the rate of decrease of the critical density owing to
the applied magnetic field when the magnetic field is
applied parallel to the crystal c axis (that is,
perpendicular to the tape surface) is considerably higher
than when the magnetic field is applied perpendicular to the 
crystal c axis of the oxide superconductor (that is,
parallel to the tape surface).Therefore, when a current conductor produced by using a
conventional oxide
