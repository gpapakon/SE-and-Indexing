<ABSTRACT>
Vegetative noise protection wall, having insertable wall elements (11) which are held between segmental posts and are provided with a nutrient medium for plants and with a watering device. The wall elements (11) consist of grid mats (meshes) (15) which are provided on their inside (16) with a claw mat (27) and on their outside (19) with a layer of plaster (30). The grid mats (15) are double-walled and are held in the segmental posts opposite one another. The interspace (21) between the mutually opposite grid mats (15) can be backfilled with a substrate filling (29), and longitudinally extending empty tubes (25) for receiving the watering device (26) are laid in the interspace (21).

provided with a clinging mat (27) on their inner 
sides and with a plastered layer (30) on their outer 

sides (19), the mesh mats (15) are held opposite one 
another in the segment posts (13) like a double 

wall, the space (21) between the opposed mesh mats 
(15) can be backfilled with a substrate filling 

(29), and longitudinal empty pipes (25) for housing 
the irrigation device (26) are laid in the space
