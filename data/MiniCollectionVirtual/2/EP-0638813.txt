<ABSTRACT>
A quadrature multiple coil array (30) in a magnetic 
resonance system, e.g. for medical diagnostic imaging, 

includes a plurality of quadrature coil pairs (50₁, 50₂ .., 
50
n
). Each coil pair includes a loop coil (52) or other coil 
which is sensitive to radio frequency signal components that 

are perpendicular to the coil and a flat Helmholtz coil (54) 
or other coil which is sensitive to radio frequency 

components parallel to the plane of the coil. The coils of 
each of the quadrature coil pairs are overlapped (56) by an 

amount which minimizes coupling between the coils. This 
enables resonance signals to be picked-up concurrently in 

quadrature by each of the quadrature pairs and to be 
demodulated by a corresponding series of receivers (32₁, 32₂, 

..., 32
n
). The data from the overlapping regions to which 
each quadrature pair is sensitive are reconstructed into 

image representations. The image representations are 
aligned either automatically or by the operator and 

displayed on a video monitor (44). The overlapping 
quadrature coil pairs can be arranged along a planar 

substrate (58) or along a curved substrate which confirms to 
contours of the anatomy of a subject.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to the magnetic resonance systems. It finds
particular application in conjunction with radio frequency (RF) surface coil arrays for use
m systems for use in medical diagnostic applications of magnetic resonance imaging and
will be described with particular reference thereto. However the present invention also
finds application with coil arrays for use in magnetic resonance systems for use in other
techniques such as spectroscopy, imaging for other than medical diagnostic purposes, and
the like.Conventionally, magnetic resonance imaging procedures include the excitation
of magnetic resonance of selected dipoles within a subject and receiving the magnetic
resonance signals emanating from the dipoles. In many applications, the magnetic
resonance signals are received with whole body RF coils, i.e. circularly cylindrical RF
coils which surround the patient receiving bore of the magnetic resonance imaging
apparatus. WO-A-93 03393, discloses a pair of overlapping birdcage coils which are
magnetically isolated from each other by the overlap geometry. In other applications,
a surface coil is applied to a surface of the patient adjacent the area of interest while the
patient is located within the bore to receive the magnetic resonance signals emanating
from the resonating nuclei.Various surface coil configurations have been utilized. A simple loop, e.g. a
simple square or circle, coils have been utilized to receive the magnetic resonance
signals. Loop coils are sensitive to signal components that are perpendicular to the loop
and insensitive to components in the plane of the loop. In order to improve the signal-to-noise
ratio, quadrature surface coils have been utilized to examine a region of interest 
in quadrature, i.e. receive signal components that are perpendicular to the coil and
components that are parallel to the coil. See, for example, Figure 4 in DE-A-40 30 371.
Another example is US Patent No. 4,918,388 which includes a loop coil and a flat
Helmholtz coil, both of which receive resonance signals from the same region. The loop
and flat Helmholtz coils are sensitive to orthogonal components of the magnetic resonance
signal. When the output of one of the loop and flat Helmholtz coils is phase shifted by
90° and the two signals are combined, the signal-to-noise ratio is improved by about the
square root of 2.In order to examine larger regions, surface coils consisting of a plurality of loop
coils have been used. See, for example, US Patent No. 4,825,162 of Roemer and
Edelstein.
