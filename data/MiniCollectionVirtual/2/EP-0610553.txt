<DESCRIPTION>
In accordance with the present invention novel compounds 
having potassium channel activating activity and useful, for example, as 
antiischemic agents are disclosed. These compounds have the general 
formula 
and pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof wherein
 
   A is 
or a single bond to complete an indoline 
nucleus;
 
   X is -O-, -S- or -NCN;
 
   R₁ is aryl, arylalkyl, heterocyclo or (heterocyclo)alkyl;
 
   R₂ is hydrogen, alkyl or arylalkyl;
 
   or R₁ and R₂ taken together form a 5- to 7-membered saturated 
or unsaturated ring, which may further include an aryl group fused to 2 
carbon atoms of such 5- to 7-membered ring;
 
   R₃, R₄, R₇ and R₈ are each independently hydrogen, alkyl or 
arylalkyl; or R₃ and R₄, or independently R₇ and R₈, taken together with  
 
the carbon atoms to which they are attached form a 5- to 7-membered 
carbocyclic ring, with the proviso that when A is 
and R₇ and R₈ 
are other than hydrogen, then R₃ and R₄ are hydrogen, or when R₇ and R₈ 
are hydrogen then, R₃ and R₄ are other than hydrogen;
 
   R₅ is hydrogen, alkyl, haloalkyl, alkenyl, alkynyl, cycloalkyl, 
arylalkyl, (cycloalkyl)alkyl, -CN, -NO₂, -COR, -COOR, -CONHR, 
-CON(R)₂, -CF₃, S-alkyl, -SOalkyl, -SO₂alkyl, 
halogen, amino, substituted amino, -O-alkyl, 
-OCF₃, -OCH₂CF₃, -OCOalkyl, -OCONRalkyl, -NRCOalkyl, 
NRCOOalkyl or -NRCON(R)₂ wherein R is hydrogen, alkyl, aryl, 
arylalkyl, cycloalkyl, (cycloalkyl)alkyl or haloalkyl;
 
   R₆ is hydrogen, alkyl, halo, -OH, -O-alkyl, amino, substituted 
amino, -O-alkyl, -OCOalkyl, -OCONRalkyl, -NRCOalkyl, -NRCOOalkyl 
or -NRCON(R)₂ ; and
 
   n is an integer of 1, 2 or 3. This invention relates to the novel compounds of formula I 
which are useful as antiischemic agents. The term "alkyl" used in defining various symbols refers to 
straight or branched chain saturated hydrocarbon radicals having up to 
eight carbons, preferably from one to five carbons. Similarly, the terms 
"alkoxy" and "alkylthio" refer to such alkyl groups attached to an oxygen 
or sulfur. The term "alkenyl" refers to straight or branched chain 
hydrocarbon radicals having from two to eight carbons and at least one 
double bond, preferably three to five carbons. The term "alkynyl" refers to 
straight or branched chain hydrocarbon radicals having from two to eight 
carbons and at least one triple bond, preferably three to five carbons.  The term "cycloalkyl" refers to saturated carbocyclic rings of 3 
to 7 carbon atoms with cyclopropyl, cyclopentyl and cyclohexyl being 
most preferred. The term
