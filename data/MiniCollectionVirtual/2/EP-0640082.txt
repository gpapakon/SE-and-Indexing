<DESCRIPTION>
HETEROARO ATIC QUINUCLIDINENES, THEIR USE AND PREPARATIONFIELD OF THE INVENTIONThe present invention relates to novel chemical compounds having activity at central and peripheral nervous systems, pharmaceutical compositions containing them, the use of the compounds for preparing medicaments, and processes for their preparation. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION AND PRIOR ART Acetylcholine is one of the most important neurotransmitters in the central and peripheral nervous systems. Receptors mediating the actions of acetylcholine are subdivided into nicotine-like and muscarine-like, based on the action of particular agonists and antagonists. The cholinergic receptors in the central nervous system of mammals are mainly muscarinic. Cholinergic deficiencies in the central nervous system have been implicated in several neurological and mental illnesses, such as Alzheimer's disease and senile dementia of the Alzheimer type. Muscarinic agonists capable of increasing the cholinergic transmission in the brain, particularily in the cortex, may therefore be of therapeutic value in the treatment of Alzheimer's disease and other diseases related to impairment of the cholinergic nervous system. Muscarinic receptors in the peripheral nervous system mediate the actions of acetylcholine at parasympathetic postganglionic neuroeffector junctions. Evidence also indicate that muscarinic receptors can modulate transmission in autonomic ganglia. Muscarinic presynaptic receptors regulating transmitter release are present in the central as well as peripheral nervous system.Stimulation of postsynaptic peripheral receptors generate numerous physiological responses, including smooth muscle contraction, secretion by various glands, broncho- constriction, relaxation of vascular smooth muscles, decrease in the cardiac rate and force of contraction.Among the various compounds which are described in the prior art as having activity on muscarinic receptors are, 

for instance, derivatives based upon azabicyclic alkanes, particularly azabicyclo[2.2.2]octane (quinuclidine) and azabicyclo[2.2.1] eptane derivatives. Thusr for example, EP-A-301 729 discloses oxadiazolyl-substituted quinuclidine and quinuclidinene compounds which are potent muscarinic agonists.EP-A-307 142 discloses oxathiazolyl-substituted quinuclidine and quinuclidinene compounds having potent muscarinic agonist activity. EP-A-307 141 discloses oxazolyl- and thiazolyl- substituted quinuclidines and quinuclidinenes which stimulate muscarinic acetylcholine receptors.EP-A-287 356
