<ABSTRACT>
The aim of the invention is to provide power assistance for the piston (6) in the compression cylinder (3) of a gas-driven power switch, using the magnetic field generated by the break current. In the invention proposed, a hollow-cylindrical body (12) made of ferromagnetic material, which concentrically surrounds a stationary contact element (2), is rigidly attached to the compression cylinder (3). The body (12) has at least one slot (16) in it in which the piston rod (7, 9) of the piston (6) is guided. A section (9) of the piston rod (7, 9) is made of ferromagnetic material. As soon as a small part of this section enters the slot (16), it is pulled into the slot (16) under the action of the break current. This accelerates the piston (6) in the opposite direction to the cylinder (3). The maximum arc-quenching pressure is thus reached sooner than with a piston driven by gas pressure alone. The invention is intended for use in arc blow-out switches, in particular SF6 switches.
