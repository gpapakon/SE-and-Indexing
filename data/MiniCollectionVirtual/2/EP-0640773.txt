<ABSTRACT>
A frictional engagement device for an automatic 
transmission, by which an input shaft (1) and an output 

shaft (20) are engaged or disengaged by use of oil pressure. 
 
A casing (2) connected to an input shaft (1) and a first 
piston (3) disposed in the casing (2) define a first oil 

pressure chamber (6). The first piston (3) is rotationally 
movable by predetermined angle and is axially movable by 

predetermined distance relative to the casing (2). A 
second piston (4) disposed in the first piston (3) defines a 

second oil pressure chamber (13) with the first piston (3), and 
the second piston (4) is axially movable relative to the 

first piston (3). Separator plates (17a,b,c) axially slidably 
connected to the first piston (3) and clutch discs (22a,b,c) axially 

slidably connected to a hub (21) which is fixedly connected 
to the output shaft (20) are engaged by a displacement of 

the second piston (4) by supplying pressurized oil to the 
second oil pressure chamber (13) and/or to the first oil 

pressure chamber (6). The oil passages in the casing (2) and 
the first piston (3) connect to each other when one of them 

rotationally moves relative to the other after the first 
piston (3) is displaced with supplying pressurized oil to 

the first oil pressure chamber (6). The pressurized oil 
supplied to the first oil pressure chamber (6) is then 

discharged and the engagement is released.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a frictional 
engagement device for an automatic transmission, 
especially for an automatic transmission used in an 
automobile that engages and disengages two members to 
change the route of transmitting torque in an automatic 
transmission, so that gear ratio is changed. Generally an automatic transmission used in an 
automobile has one or more planetary gearsets between 
an input shaft which is connected to a torque converter 
and an output shaft which is connected to a propeller 
shaft or an axle shaft. Each planetary gearset has 
three elements, i.e. a ring gear, a sun gear and a 
planet-pinion carrier assembly. Gear shifts are made by 
changing the engagement of an element used in each 
planetary gearset by means of a frictional engagement 
device. Suppose a shift is made by changing the 
engagement of one element PGIa in planetary gearset PGI 
which is disposed in the input side and one element PGOa 
in planetary gearset PGO which is disposed in the 
output side. Suppose more specifically, the shift is 
made from one gear speed (hereinafter called the first 
gear speed) in which element PGIa is rotating and 
element PGOa is not rotating, to the next gear speed 
(hereinafter called the second gear speed) in which 
element PGIa in planetary gearset PGI and element PGOa 
in planetary gearset PGO are both rotating while engaged 
with each other, and to the next but one gear speed 
(hereinafter called the third gear speed) in which 
element PGIa is not rotating and element PGOa is 
rotating.  
 The frictional engagement device disposed 
between the PGIa and PGOa is required to operate as 
follows: 
(1) To make it possible to shift smoothly from 
the first gear speed to the second gear speed, the 
device gradually engages the element PGIa in planetary 
gearset PGI which is in a rotating condition and 
element PGOa which is in a stationary condition so that 
transfer element PGOa from a stationary condition to 
rotating condition; (2) To make it possible to keep the second 
gear speed, the device holds the engaged condition; (3) To make it possible to drive in engine 
brake condition, the device transmits a torque from the 
element PGOa to the element PGIa; (4) To make it possible to shift smoothly from 
the second gear speed to the third gear speed, the 
device disengages at once when the element PGIa in 
planetary gearset PGI in rotating condition is stopped 
so that prevent the element PGOa from suffering the 
force of stopping; and (5) To make it possible to have no
