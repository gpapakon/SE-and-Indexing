<ABSTRACT>
The picture reproduction apparatus of this 
invention reproduces compressed image data which has 

been compressed using inter-frame encoding, extracts a 
header from the reproduced image data, taking out 

intra-frame encoded image data using the information of 
the header. Invalid data is added to the image data 

other than the intra-frame encoded data. The image data 
is output into a picture decoding apparatus, so as to 

obtain a reproduced video image during playback in fast 
forward and fast reverse. Alternatively, valid image 

data is detected from the reproduced image data. In 
the slow playback at a 1/N speed, the valid image data 

of M (
<
 N) frames and the invalid data of (N-M) frames, 
so as to obtain the slow image output.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a picture
reproduction apparatus and a picture decoding apparatus
used for reproducing a digital compressed video image
recorded on a recording medium.An apparatus for recording/reproducing a
compressed digital video image has been developed with
the progress of picture compression techniques. Figure
18 is a block diagram of a conventional picture recording/reproducing
apparatus. The conventional picture
recording/reproducing apparatus shown in Figure 18
includes a picture encoding section 91 using an intra-frame
discrete cosine transform (DCT) encoder, a recording
section 92, a recording medium 93, a reproducing
section 94, and a picture decoding section 95 using
an intra-frame DCT decoder. A digital video image
taken by a camera or the like is input into the intra-frame
DCT encoder 91. In the intra-frame DCT encoder
91, the digital video image is encoded by data processing
such as DCT and variable length encoding, frame by
frame. Then, the processed video signal is rearranged
into a recording format, and an error correction code
is added thereto in the recording section 92. Thereafter,
the reformatted digital video signal with the
error correction code is recorded onto the recording
medium 93. During the playback, any error in the
reproduced signal is corrected, and the reproduced
signal is reformatted into a decoding format in the
reproducing section 94. Thereafter, the reproduced 
signal is decoded by a data process such as variable
length decoding and inverse DCT in the picture decoding
section 95, so as to obtain a reproduced video image.
As to the intra-frame encoding, a usual encoding is
completed in a data unit of one frame or one block
consisting of (8 x 8) pixels or the like. Accordingly,
during playback in fast forward or fast reverse in
which only a part of data can be reproduced, the resuiting
video image has a certain quality with which
the contents of the image can be perceived (see, for
example, "Study on Image Quality Reproduced at Variable
Speeds by Digital VCR", by Takakura et al., Extended
Abstracts; The Annual Meeting of The Institute of Television
Engineers, 1992, pp. 93-94).Figure 19 is a block diagram of a conventional
picture decoding apparatus using motion-compensation
and inter-frame encoding techniques. In Figure 19, a
picture decoding section 4 includes a buffer 41, a
variable length decoder 42, an inverse quantization
circuit 43, an inverse DCT circuit 44, and a motion
compensating circuit 45. Also, a frame memory 5 is
provided. First,
