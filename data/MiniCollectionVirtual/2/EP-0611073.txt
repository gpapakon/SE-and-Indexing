<ABSTRACT>
A guidewire including a core wire (10) extending into a 
lumen of a helical coil (24) and having a proximal end of 

the helical coil fixedly attached thereto. At least one 
round forming wire (34) is fixedly attached to a distal 

region of the core wire and extends through the lumen of the 
helical coil. A rounded protrusion (36) is provided at a 

distal end of the helical coil with the round forming 
wire(s) and the helical coil fixedly attached thereto.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to guidewires used in the 
placement of catheters in cardiovascular surgical 
procedures. More particularly, this invention relates to 
improvements in small diameter steerable guidewires. A wide variety of guidewires are used for various medical 
purposes in the treatment of the human body. Among the 
more common uses is in blood vessels to guide a catheter 
to a site within the patient's blood vessel to perform 
the procedure for which the catheter is adapted. For 
example, guidewires, particularly small diameter 
steerable guidewires, perform an important function in 
percutaneous translumenal coronary angioplasty ("PCTA"). Ideally, a guidewire should exhibit the following 
characteristics: 
1. a strong yet flexible tip; 2. an easily formable tip, although not so formable 
that the guidewire takes a permanent set when the wire is 
bent over on itself during use in the body; and 3. a tip that exhibits 1:1 tip torque response with no 
whipping. The guidewires in US patent No 4.545.390 (Leary) and US 
patent No 4.538.622 (Samson et al) have a torsionally 
rigid longitudinally flexible shaft and a flexible distal 
end that includes a radiopaque coil so that the physician  
 
can monitor fluoroscopically the position and advancement 
of the guidewire in the patient's blood vessel. Many such existing guidewires provide a strong, flexible 
and formable tip. However, due to a non-symmetrical tip 
design including a flattened safety wire, such guidewires 
do not transmit torque 1:1. Where a guidewire does not 
provide 1:1 tip torque response, torsional energy is 
stored in the guidewire. At some point during arterial 
insertion the energy may be released causing the 
guidewire tip to "whip" or move in an unpredictable and 
uncontrolled manner. For a physician attempting to 
insert a guidewire in a tortuous anatomy, such 
unpredictable and uncontrolled behaviour is unacceptable. With the foregoing in mind, it is an object of the 
invention to provide a guidewire that provides 1:1 tip 
torque response. It is a further object of the invention to provide a 
guidewire with a strong yet flexible tip that exhibits no 
whipping. EP-A-255234, which is used as a basis for the preamble of claim 1, 
and US-A-5144959 both disclose a guidewire 
comprising a helical coil having a proximal end, a distal 
end, and a lumen extending therethrough, a core wire 
having a distal region extending into said lumen with a 
proximal end of the helical coil fixedly attached  
 
thereto, a round forming wire
</DESCRIPTION>
<CLAIMS>
A guidewire comprising a helical coil (24) having a 
proximal end, a distal end, and a lumen extending 

therethrough, a core wire (10) having a distal region 
extending into said lumen with a proximal end of the 

helical coil (24) fixedly attached thereto, a round 
forming wire (34) fixedly attached to said distal region 

of the core wire (10) and extending through the lumen in 
the helical coil (24) and a protrusion (36) provided at 

the distal end of the helical coil (24) with said round 
forming wire (34) and said helical coil (24) fixedly 

attached thereto 
characterised in that
 at least one 
additional round cylindrical forming wire (34) is 

attached to the distal region of the core wire (10) and 
said protrusion (36) whereby the round forming wires (34) 

are symmetrically arranged around a reduced diameter 
segment (14) of the distal region of the core wire (10) 

to provide both increased tensile strength and decreased 
stiffness to the guidewire. 
A guidewire in accordance with claim 1 characterised 
in that the plurality of round forming wires (34) are 

fixedly attached to said core wire (10) by a brazed joint 
(28). 
A guidewire in accordance with claim 1 characterised 
in that the protrusion (36) is formed by melting the 

helical coil (24) and the round forming wires (34) into 
a rounded tip.  

 
A guidewire in accordance with any preceding claim 
characterised in that the helical coil (24) is fixedly 

attached to the core wire (10) by at least one brazed 
joint (28). 
A guidewire in accordance with any preceding claim 
characterised in that the helical coil (24) is fixedly 

attached to the core wire (10) at a tapered section (16) 
thereof. 
A guidewire in accordance with claim 5 wherein the 
helical coil (24) is fixedly attached to the core wire 

(10) by a brazed joint (28) at a proximal end thereof. 
A guidewire in accordance with any preceding claim 
characterised in that individual coils of the helical 

coil (24) are expanded along a partial length thereof.
