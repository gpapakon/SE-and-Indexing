<DESCRIPTION>
Smooth muscle cell proliferation plays an important
role in diseases such as atherosclerosis and restenosis.
Vascular restenosis after percutaneous transluminal
coronary angioplasty (PTCA) has been shown to be a tissue
response characterized by an early and late phase. The
early phase occuring hours to days after PTCA is due to
thrombosis with some vasospasms while the late phase
appears to be dominated by excessive proliferation and
migration of smooth muscle cells. In this disease, the
increased cell motility and colonization by smooth muscle
cells and macrophages contribute significantly to the
pathogenesis of the disease. The excessive proliferation
and migration of vascular smooth muscle cells may be the
primary mechanism to the reocclusion of coronary arteries
following PTCA, atherectomy, laser angioplasty and arterial
bypass graft surgery. See "Intimal Proliferation of Smooth
Muscle Cells as an Explanation for Recurrent Coronary
Artery Stenosis after Percutaneous Transluminal Coronary
Angioplasty," Austin et al., Journal of the AmericanCollege of Cardiology 8: 369-375 (Aug. 1985).Vascular restenosis remains a major long term
complication following surgical intervention of blocked
arteries by percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty
(PTCA), atherectomy, laser angioplasty and arterial bypass
graft surgery. In about 35% of the patients who undergo
PTCA, reocclusion occurs within three to six months after
the procedure. The current strategies for treating
vascular restenosis include mechanical intervention by
devices such as stents or pharmacologic therapies including
heparin, low molecular weight heparin, coumarin, aspirin,
fish oil, calcium antagonist, steroids, and prostacyclin.
These strategies have failed to curb the reocclusion rate
and have been ineffective for the treatment and prevention 
of vascular restenosis. See "Prevention of Restenosis after
Percutaneous Transluminal Coronary Angioplasty: The Search
for a 'Magic Bullet'," Hermans et al., American Heart
Journal 122: 171-187 (July 1991).In the pathogenesis of restenosis excessive cell
proliferation and migration occurs as a result of growth
factors produced by cellular constituents in the blood and
the damaged arterial vessel wall which mediate the
proliferation of smooth muscle cells in vascular
restenosis.Agents that inhibit the proliferation and/or migration
of smooth muscle cells are useful in the treatment and
prevention of restenosis. The present invention provides
for the use of compounds as smooth muscle cell
proliferation
