<ABSTRACT>
An electronic traffic tariff reception system can 
identify a vehicle traveling freely on a road having a plurality 

of lanes clearly and impose a predetermined debit 
value on the vehicle in the non-stop manner and in the 

cashless manner. Further, the system can photograph an image 
of an illegally passing vehicle. A vehicle identification 

apparatus can identify the vehicles traveling freely on the 
road having the plurality of lanes separately in a control 

point of the reception system. 
An in-vehicle unit equipped with a smart card is 
mounted in a vehicle. An antenna for debiting process capable 

of performing radio communication with the in-vehicle 
unit is disposed. There are provided an antenna controller 

for causing the antenna for debiting process to receive 
personal information and vehicle information, a local controller 

for judging whether the information is normal or not 
or the vehicle is to be debited or not, and an apparatus for 

photographing an illegally passing vehicle. 
The in-vehicle unit is mounted in each of vehicles and 
at least one or more antennas are disposed above the road in 

association with each lane. When radio communication with 
the in-vehicle unit is made by means of the antennas, the 

antennas are started in the time sharing multiple accessing 
method.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an electronic traffic
tariff reception system.In a conventional traffic tariff reception system of a
toll road, a reception person in a toll gate directly
receives a toll or a traffic tariff in cash from a driver or
the driver throws the traffic tariff in cash into an automatic
machine to receive the traffic tariff automatically.
Thus, the driver is required to stop at the toll gate once
and provide cash for the traffic tariff.On the contrary, there is being developed a near-future
traffic tariff reception system including a communication
apparatus such as a non-contact IC card provided in a vehicle
and which stores information peculiar to the vehicle and can
communicate by radio with an external apparatus.EP 0 401 192 A1 discloses an electronic traffic tariff
reception system comprising the features of the preamble of
claim 1. In this system, a steady sequence of
staggered response request signals is sent from fixed transmitters
to in-vehicle units. Following the receipt of each
response request signal, each in-vehicle unit randomly
selects one of several available time slots to transmit a
response signal.WO-A-92/15 978 discloses an arrangement for locating and
exchanging data with every single object of a plurality of
objects moving in a predetermined zone. These objects, which
may be vehicles, receive a microwave signal from a fixed
station and, in response, send handshake signals.US-A-4 303 904 discloses an automatic toll payment system in
which each vehicle would use clearly marked toll lanes. The
system has three major components, a vehicle borne transponder-data-processor,
a toll booth transponder-computer for each lane
and an increasing-cash-balance register. The transponders use
microwave transmissions in half duplex and amplitude modulation
of data in data pulses together with clock pulses. A data
diplexer separates out the data pulse.A further example of the above near-future traffic tariff
reception system is now described with reference to Fig. 23.
As shown in Fig. 23, an IC card 06 constituting the   
communication apparatus is attached on the inside of a wind-shield
of a vehicle 07. The IC card 06 is provided with an
antenna 026 and information such as an identification number
peculiar to the vehicle is stored in the IC card 06.On the other hand, in a toll gate, an outdoor terminal
equipment 01 including transmitting and receiving antennas
017 and 018 is disposed for each traffic lane. The outdoor
terminal equipment 01 is connected to a data processing
