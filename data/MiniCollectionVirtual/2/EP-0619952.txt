<ABSTRACT>
An additive for cholesterol-containing food, containing a rice bran component and/or a derivative thereof as an active 
ingredient, a method of using same, and food treated thereby; and a process for producing mayonnaise controlled in the rise of a 

blood cholesterol level, or the absorption of cholesterol. A method of decreasing the effect of cholesterol contained in food on a 
living organism, for example, controlling the rise of a blood cholesterol level by adding to cholesterol-containing 

food a food additive 
capable of forming a complex with cholesterol, such as an extract of a rice bran component, γ-orizanol 

(γ-OZ) which is a 
mixture of esters of ferulic acid with various alcohols prepared by refining said extract and/or a derivative of a rice bran component, 

thereby forming a cholesterol complex of the food additive, whereby the cholesterol contained in food becomes nonabsorbable 
by a living organism or can be removed therefrom.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to an additive for a 
cholesterol-containing food which comprises rice bran 
components and/or derivatives thereof as an active component, 
use of the same and a food obtained by this method. More particularly, it relates to a food additive 
which comprises a rice bran component extract (hereinafter 
referred to simply as the extract), ferulates of various 
alcohols obtained by purifying the extract, γ-oryzanol 
(hereinafter referred to simply as γ-OZ), i.e., a mixture of 
these esters, and/or derivatives of the rice bran components 
capable of forming a cholesterol complex; use of the same; 
and a food which has been prepared by this method which forms 
a cholesterol complex. In recent years, an increase in cholesterol intake 
accompanying the diversification in our eating habits has 
become a serious social problem in connection with diseases. 
Namely, we frequently take foods of a high cholesterol 
content in these days. As a result, cholesterol contained in 
these foods elevates the blood cholesterol level, which is 
the major cause of, for example, arteriosclerosis.  To lower the cholesterol content in these foods, 
there have been reported some methods for decomposing 
cholesterol with the use of cholesterol oxidase. Rice bran contains a number of components. For 
example, γ-OZ, which is prepared by purifying these 
components, is a mixture of ferulates of various vegetable 
sterols and triterpene alcohol. For example, γ-OZ consists 
of 14% of campesterol ferulate, 1% of stigmasterol ferulate, 
4% of β-sitosterol ferulate, 2% of cycloartanol ferulate, 35% 
of cycloartenol ferulate and 44% of 24-methylene cycloartanol 
ferulate. As examples of the application of γ-OZ to medical 
purposes, there has been reported that it has pharmacological 
effects of promoting growth, controlling diencephalic 
function, lowering serum cholesterol level, increasing amine-like 
compounds in amygdaloid nucleus and stimulating gonad, 
and clinical effects of treating menopausal disorders and 
autonomic imbalance. Regarding the above-mentioned effect of γ-OZ of 
lowering serum cholesterol level, its effects on 
catabolism/excretion of cholesterol in rat has been reported 
[Geriatric Medicine, vol. 18, 519 - 524 (1980); Domyakukoka 
(arteriosclerosis), vol. 11 (2), 411 - 416 (1983)]. In the field of food, γ-OZ has been employed as an 
antioxidant. However, since γ-OZ exhibits only a very weak  
 
antioxidant effect, it is scarcely used alone but mixed with 
tocopherol so as to enhance its effect.
