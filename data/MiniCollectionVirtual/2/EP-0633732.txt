<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a method of making, and
using in foods, flavour oil capsules.A considerable amount of effort has been
devoted for many years to provide solid particulate
flavoring materials in which a flavor oil is
contained in the particulate matrix. Various
attempts have been made to fix flavor oils in many
different types of organic matrices to provide
stable free-flowing powders or particles which
contain the flavor oils for flavor release when
incorporated into many types of foods. Several
principle techniques have been proposed for the 
preparation of solid particulate flavoring
materials. These are plating, spray-drying and
encapsulation techniques.In a typical spray-drying operation, a
flavor oil is coated or agglomerated with a solid
particulate material so that the flavor oil is
dispersed within the spray-dried particle. Spray-drying
involves the use of large quantities of air
usually at an elevated temperature of, for example,
about 120-230°C (250-450°F) to provide a solid coating or
flavor matrix surrounding the flavor oil.
Conventional spray drying can cause changes to take
place in the flavor oil and can also result in
sizeable losses of volatile constituents by
evaporation. The loss of flavor may adversely
affect the final flavor due to the fact that loss
of flavoring material may be made up largely of the
very low boiling point constituents with the result
that the loss of these constituents changes the
flavor of the end product.More recently, as evidenced by European
patent application numbers EP 455598 and 401954,
flavor oils have been microencapsulated in the form
of coacervate microcapsules, which comprise a core
of flavor oil and a coating layer around the core.
The coating layer is prepared by coacervation which
is a process for the aggregation of colloidal 
spheres held together by electrostatic forces. In
complex coacervation, the aggregation of colloidal
spheres is a mixture of two or more oppositely
charged hydrophilic colloidal materials of both
cationic and anionic type. For instance, the
colloidal material may be selected from the group
of materials such as gelatin, casein, agar-agar,
gum arabic, carboxymethylcellulose and the like and
mixtures thereof. Coacervation, or aggregation to
uniformly distribute the colloidal materials around
the flavour oil droplets, is then carried out by
diluting an emulsion of the flavor oil in the
presence of such colloidal materials with water,
adjusting the pH of the emulsion, or temperature or
combinations of such techniques.It
</DESCRIPTION>
<CLAIMS>
A method of flavouring foods comprising forming an emulsion
of discrete flavour oil droplets in water, forming a polymeric

coating over the discrete flavour oil droplets by coacervation
to produce flavour oil capsules in the water, cross-linking the

polymeric coating on the capsules in water, and dewatering the
polymer coated flavour oil capsules, characterised in that the

dewatering is only partial and such as to provide aqueous liquid
flavour oil capsules containing 15% to 40% capsules solids, and

in that the method includes incorporating the capsules into a
food in an effective flavour amount, processing the capsules by

subjecting them to a mechanical shearing force in incorporating
them into said food, and cooking said food by heating, the

capsules protecting the flavour oil in the cooked food and being
fracturable upon chewing of the cooked food to provide a uniform

and sustained flavour oil release.
A method as claimed in Claim 1, wherein the
microencapsulated flavour oil capsules each have about 70-95% by

weight oil.
A method as claimed in either Claim 1 or Claim 2, wherein
the ratio of the flavour oil to the polymeric coating in the

flavour oil capsules is about 10:1 to about 5:1.
A method as claimed in any preceding Claim, wherein the
flavour oil capsules are sized up to about 600 microns.
A method as claimed in any preceding Claim, wherein the
polymer coating comprises gelatin, or mixtures of gelatin with

carboxymethylcellulose, gum arabic, or alginate.
A method as claimed in any preceding Claim, wherein the
polymeric coating is gelatin and wherein the method includes

cross-linking with glutaraldehyde or alum.
A method as claimed in any preceding Claim, further 
comprising extrusion of the food containing the flavour oil

capsules.
A method as claimed in preceding Claim, wherein the food is
candy.
A method as claimed in either Claim 7, or Claim 8 as
appendant to Claim 7, comprising cooking the extruded food

product.
A method as claimed in any preceding Claim, comprising
injecting the liquid flavour oil capsules into the food prior to

cooking.
A method as claimed in any preceding Claim, comprising
cooking by frying the food in hot oil.
A method as claimed in any one of Claims 1 to 10, comprising
cooking by baking.
A method as claimed in any one of Claims 1 to 10, comprising
cooking by microwave heating.
A method as claimed in any preceding Claim, comprising
incorporating the flavour oil capsules into the food by coating

the food with the capsules.
A method as claimed in Claim 14, wherein the capsules are
coated onto the food by spraying.
A method as claimed in any preceding Claim, wherein the food
is meat, poultry, fish, seafood, vegetable, fruit, cheese,

potato, or a flour-based food product.
A method as claimed in any preceding Claim, wherein the food
is a flour-based food product and the method includes providing

a mix of ingredients for the flour-based food product containing
the aqueous liquid flavour oil capsules before microwave heating. 
A method as claimed in any preceding Claim, wherein the food
is a flour-based food product, preferably cake, brownies, bread,

biscuit, cookies or pie.
A method as claimed in any preceding Claim, wherein the

liquid flavour oil capsules contain a fat or vegetable oil, the
capsules being fracturable upon chewing of the food to provide

a low dose of fat or oil in the food with a high fat or oil dose
perception.
