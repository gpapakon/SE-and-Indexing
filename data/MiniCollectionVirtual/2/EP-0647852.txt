<ABSTRACT>
A static vent unit particularly for use in the side of a 
helicopter fuselage includes a 

support plate (12) having a vent port (14) and a strake (15) 
extending generally 

horizontally below the 
vent port with an upper surface facing the vent port and generally 

perpendicular to the 
support plate surface, and airflow deflection means (20) located below 

the strake to deflect 
airflow away from the strake when the unit is operating in an 

airflow from below the 
strake.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to static vent units and particularly to such units for use on 
helicopters. Static vent units are used on both fixed and rotary wing aircraft to sense the ambient 
pressure of the air through which the aircraft is flying. This provides an indication of 
the altitude at which the aircraft is flying and, in combination with a pressure signal 
sensed by a forward facing pitot tube, an indication of the airspeed and, for fixed wing 
aircraft, the Mach number. For this reason, static vent units have ideally to be located in a position where the local 
ambient pressure varies only with altitude and not with other features such as airspeed 
and relative wind direction, and are therefore usually located in the sides of an aircraft 
fuselage. It has been proposed to locate such a sideways facing static vent unit in the nose of a 
helicopter in order to reduce the weight and complexity associated with long pipe runs 
to the more usual location in a helicopter tail boom. The nose location is subjected 
during certain phases of operation, e.g. the hover, to below ambient pressures, and a 
strake device has been located beneath the vent port to increase the pressure at the vent 
port and compensate for the negative pressure at the vent port location. During a flight test of a helicopter fitted with such a static vent unit involving a high rate 
of descent, it was noted that the forward speed appeared to be slower than that indicated 
in the cockpit. Subsequent wind tunnel tests indicated that when subjected to positive 
airflow incidence (relative airflow from below) such as occurred during the descent, a 
pressure coefficient above the strake in the area of the vent port reduced significantly 
causing an incorrect indicated airspeed on the cockpit instruments. US-A-3612439 discloses a static vent unit for a high performance fixed wing aircraft 
designed to operate over a wide Mach number range extending to supersonic values. The  
 
unit includes compensation means in the form of an exterior shallow bulge having a 
thickness which decreases smoothly from a central region to the edges and includes a 
static vent formed by an aperture located in the surface of the bulge itself and offset in 
respect of a major axis of the vent unit. The prior device operates to modify the airflow locally in operation so as to compensate 
a position error arising from variation in Mach number, and in respect of airflow from 
only one of two generally perpendicularly opposed directions. The aforementioned

<CLAIMS>
A static vent unit located in the side of a helicopter fuselage with an outer surface 
of a support plate substantially flush with a surface of the fuselage, a circular vent port 

through the plate and an elongated strake extending substantially horizontally below the 
vent port with an upper surface facing the vent port and generally perpendicular to said 

support plate surface, characterised by airflow deflection means located below the strake 
to deflect airflow away from the strake when the unit is operating in a positive 

relative air flow from below. 
A unit as claimed in Claim 1, further characterised in that said airflow deflection 
means comprise a fairing below said perpendicularly extending upper surface of the 

strake. 
A unit as claimed in Claim 2, further characterised in that a length and height of 
the fairing is approximately equal to the perpendicularly extending upper surface of the 

strake. 
A unit as claimed in Claim 2 or Claim 3, further characterised in that said fairing 
has a radiussed nose portion. 
A unit as claimed in any one of Claims 2, 3 or 4, further characterised in that the 
fairing is located adjacent the strake and slopes downwardly to a generally sharp lower 

edge. 
A unit as claimed in any one of Claims 2, 3 or 4, further characterised in that the 
fairing is integral with the strake. 
A unit as claimed in any one of Claims 2, 3 or 4, further characterised in that the 
fairing is remote from the strake and has an upper edge portion located perpendicular to 

a pre-selected positive airflow incidence angle measured from the horizontal plane of the 
upper surface of the strake. 
A unit as claimed in Claim 7, further characterised in that said upper edge portion 
is a bluff edge.  

 
A unit as claimed in Claim 7 or Claim 8, further characterised in that said 
incidence angle is between 20 degrees and 70 degrees. 
A unit as claimed in Claim 9, further characterised in that said incidence angle 
is about 50 degrees. 
A unit as claimed in any one of Claims 2 to 10, further characterised in that said 
fairing is generally semi-circular in plan with a generally smooth convex surface.
