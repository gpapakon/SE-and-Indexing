<ABSTRACT>
In a digital symbol receiver (6) it is necessary to generate a clock signal 
with a correct frequency and phase, so that decisions â
k
 about the value of transmitted 
symbols a
k
 can be made at the right detection instants. A simple method of obtaining 
the desired clock signal is adjusting a VCO by means of a control signal obtained from 

the correlation of a detection signal r(t) with the detected symbols â
k
 filtered by a 
symbol filter (11). The symbol filter (11) may comprise a cascade connection of a 

differentiator (16) and a filter (18) which has a transfer function which is an estimate of 
the transfer function of the channel.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a digital transmission system comprising a transmitter
coupled to a receiver by a channel, the receiver comprising a detector for determining
detected symbols at detection instants from a detection signal derived from the input signal of
the receiver, timing means for determining a timing error signal by correlation of a first
auxiliary signal derived from the detected symbols with a second auxiliary signal derived
from the input signal of the receiver, and for adapting the detection instants in response to the
timing error signal.The invention likewise relates to a receiver for such a transmission system.A transmission system as defined in the opening paragraph is known from the
journal article "Timing Recovery in Digital Synchronous Data Receivers" by K.H. Mueller
and M. Müller in IEEE Transactions on Communications, Vol. COM-24, No. 5, May 1976.Transmission systems of this type may be used, for example, for transferring
data signals via a transmission medium, for example, a cable or radio link, or for
reconstituting data signals coming from a magnetic tape or disc.When data symbols are transferred via a transmission medium or data symbols
are stored on a recording medium respectively, the symbols to be transmitted or recorded
respectively, are converted by coding means into data pulses which are applied to the
transmission medium or recording medium further to be referenced by the term of channel.The output signal of the channel is applied to the input of the receiver. A
detection signal is derived from the input signal of the receiver. This may be effected, for
example, by an adaptive equalizer and/or an adaptive echo canceller. It is likewise
conceivable that the detection signal is determined from the input signal of the receiver by a
fixed filter.At suitable detection instants the detector determines a series of detected
symbols from the detection signal. The detector may comprise a simple bit-by-bit detector,
but it is alternatively conceivable that the detector comprises a so-termed Maximum
Likelihood Sequence Estimation detector such as, for example, a Viterbi detector.If the detection instants differ from the optimum detection instants, the
contribution to the detection signal by different symbols from the symbol to be detected will 
generally increase, which will reduce the reliability of the decision made about the value of
the detected symbol. This contribution is called intersymbol interference.In order to avoid this reduction of the reliability of the decision
