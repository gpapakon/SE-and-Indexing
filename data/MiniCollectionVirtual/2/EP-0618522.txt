<ABSTRACT>
A numerically controlled apparatus capable of stopping the feeding of a tool simultaneously with the completion of the 
machining therewith when the feeding of a too
l during a machining operation is done by operating a manual pulse generator. An 
interpolation means (2) in the numerically controlled apparatus is adapted to interpolate a pulse signal HP from a manual pulse 

generator (41), and output an interpolation pulse signal CP so that a tool is moved in parallel with a designated shape stored in 
advance in a graphic storage means (1), the signal CP being sent to an axis control circuit (18). The axis control circuit (18) is 

adapted to receive this interpolation pulse signal CP, generate a speed command for each axis and send the commands to a servo 
amplifier (19). The servo amplifier (19) is adapted to output a current I for driving a servomotor attached to a machine tool (20) 

and control the machine tool (20). A load judgement means (3) is adapted to detect the driving current I outputted from the servo 
amplifier (19) and judge whether the detected load current I has decreased by a predetermined proportion or not. When the driving 

current I decreases, for example, 5 %, a driving stop signal S is outputted. The interpolation means (2), on receiving the driving 
stop signal S, stops the outputting of the interpolation signal CP, and the feeding of a tool is stopped accordingly.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a numerical 
control apparatus for controlling a machine tool, and more 
particularly to a numerical control apparatus for controlling 
a machine tool which machines prototypes or the like. Advances in the technology of numerically controlled 
machine tools have been so great that they can 
machine workpieces of complex shape at high speed with 
precision. At present, workpieces of complex shape cannot 
be machined without numerically controlled machine tools. To generate machining programs, there are widely 
used interactive numerical control apparatus which comprise 
a numerical control apparatus with an interactive program 
generating function, and automatic programming apparatus 
for simply generating complex machining programs. In the use of such numerical control apparatus, 
it is necessary to accurately define machine coordinates, a 
machine origin, program coordinates, a machining origin, 
and other data for generating strict machining programs. 
The interactive numerical control apparatus and the automatic 
programming apparatus can be used to machine a  
 
number of workpieces. For some machining processes for producing a 
prototype or a model, general-purpose milling machines, 
lathes, and the like are used which require less time to 
carry out preparatory action such as attachment and detachment 
of workpieces, installation of tools, etc., and does 
not require to generate machining programs. Machining on 
such machines or lathes has been carried out solely at the 
determination of the operator. Problems of general-purpose machine tools are 
that available operators who can handle general-purpose 
machine tools decrease, and that it is difficult for the 
general-purpose machine tools to carry out oblique linear 
machining, arcuate machining, or the like though they can 
effect linear machining without any problem. If, on the other hand, a general numerically 
controlled machine tool is used to machine a prototypes or 
a model, then it is necessary to accurately define machine 
coordinates, a machine origin, program coordinates, a 
machining origin, and other data. While it is not impossible 
to define those data, the required programming process 
is too time-consuming and troublesome for machining a 
portion of a single workpiece. To solve the above problems, the applicant has 
filed Japanese patent application No. 4-231836 on a numerical 
control apparatus which employs a general-purpose 
machine tool for carrying out simple machining processes to  
 
machine
