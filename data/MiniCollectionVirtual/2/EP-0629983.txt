<ABSTRACT>
A sensor for sensing the presence in a medium of species 
which absorb or scatter radiation, such as smoke particles 

in air, by means of changes in the attenuation of radiation 
transmitted through the medium, in which visible or infra-red 

radiation is transmitted from two sources (1 and 2), 
along dissimilar paths (3 and 4), to a receiver (5). A 

control means (6) causes the sources to emit and accurately 
controls the ratio of the emitted energies. The signal 

received from one source is subtracted from the signal 
received from the other source by another means (7). The 

difference signal is used by the control means as the basis 
for controlling the ratio of the energies emitted by the 

sources. Changes in the absorption co-efficient are 
measured by sensing changes in the difference signal and/or 

by changes in the ratio of the emitted energies.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a sensor for sensing the presence 
of species which absorb or scatter radiation, such as smoke 
particles in air, by means of changes in the attenuation of 
radiation transmitted through a medium, suitable for use in 
smoke (fire) detectors, in particular those referred to as 
point obscuration (or light extinction) fire detectors. It is well known that the presence of smoke particles 
suspended in a medium may be sensed by measuring the 
reduction in intensity (attenuation or obscuration) of a 
beam of visible or infrared radiation passing through the 
medium. This attenuation is a combination of absorption by 
the particles and several scattering mechanisms, eg: 
scattering due to absorption and re-transmission 
(Rayleigh scattering); diffraction at the particle; scattering due to surface waves on the particle; geometric reflection. The relative of importance of the scattering mechanisms 
depends on a number of factors, including the particle sizes 
and the wavelength of the radiation. The principle is used in so called optical beam smoke 
detectors, in which a beam of radiation is arranged to 
travel near ceiling level along a path of sufficient length 
(typically >10m) for a significant level of attenuation to 
be caused by smoke concentrations characteristic of the 
presence of a fire in the same volume. Often, optical beam 
smoke detectors are inconvenient to apply, and so called 
point smoke detectors are used. These are mounted on the 
ceiling of the protected volume and contain a sensitive 
device for detecting the presence of smoke in a chamber 
through which part of any airflow past the detector may by 
sampled. A number of techniques are currently used to sense 
the presence of smoke in the chamber, the most common being 
the ionisation chamber (used in ionisation smoke detectors), 
and light scattering (used in optical smoke detectors). In an ionisation chamber, an applied electric field causes 
an electrical current to flow in air which is ionised by 
particles emitted from a radioactive source. Smoke 
particles act as ion capture sites, causing a reduction in 
the current, which is sensed by an electronic circuit. In 
an optical detector, a pulse of infrared radiation is 
emitted from a source into the chamber. Smoke particles 
scatter or reflect a small proportion of the radiation, and 
this is sensed by a receiver, mounted so that it cannot 
receive radiation from the source by a direct path. Many 
optical detectors use a scatter angle of about 45 degrees

A sensor for sensing the presence of species in a medium 

which absorb or scatter radiation wherein visible or infra-red 
radiation is transmitted from at least two sources to a 

receiver along paths so arranged that the absorbing or 
scattering species attenuate a different proportion of the 

radiation transmitted along each path, characterised in that

the radiation received from one source from the signals
