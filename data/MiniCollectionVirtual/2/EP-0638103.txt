<ABSTRACT>
A process for the preparation of a perfluoropolyether having general formula (1) as defined hereinbefore, which process includes the direct fluorination with elemental fluorine of a polyether having general formula (2) as defined hereinbefore, wherein the fluorination is carried out in the presence of a solvent which is an ether having at least one substituent RF, wherein RF is a fluorinated hydrocarbon group. The said solvent ether is preferably a fluorinated volatile ether. The said solvent ether preferably has at least two groups RF which may be the same or different groups. Each group RF preferably has from two to four carbon atoms and at least two fluorine atoms. The said solvent ether may be an alicyclic ether having from 3 to 5 carbon atoms in its alicyclic ring. The intermediate polyether of formula (2) may be prepared by a process in which an appropriate straight-chained or cyclic polyether is reacted with an appropriate fluoroalkene in the presence of a sensitising medium and ultra-violet radiation is applied to energise the medium and promote multiple fluorination.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to
a process for the preparation of a perfluoropolyether.Various perfluoropolyethers (that is, fully
fluorinated polymeric ether compounds) have been developed
in recent years and are available as commercial products.
These products display a variety of useful properties,
including high resistance to thermal and chemical attack,
very low solubility in most usual solvents, and very good
lubricating properties.In EP0247887A by R D Chambers there is described a
route to such polyethers of general formula (1) as
follows:

wherein the symbols R6 to R14 each represents a fully
fluorinated hydrocarbon group, x is an integer and each of
y and z is zero or an integer, and the sum of x, y and z
is at least 2 and not greater than 100, preferably not
greater than 50. Preferably the ratio of (x+y):z is as
high as possible. Each of the groups R6, R7, R8 and R10
may contain a substituent fully fluorinated hydrocarbon
group in addition to the groups R11, R12, R13 and/or R14.The polyethers (1) are prepared by direct fluorination
with elemental fluorine of intermediate substituted
polyethers of general formula (2) as follows:

wherein the symbols R1, R2, R3, R4 and R5 each represent
substituted or unsubstituted hydrocarbon groups, which
groups may differ, the symbols RF1, RF2, RF3 and RF4 each
represent fluorine-containing hydrocarbon groups 
containing at least two carbon atoms and at least two fluorine
atoms, which groups may differ, or the combination R1-RF1 and/or
the combination R5-RF4 represents a fluorine-containing alkyl or
alkenyl group, x is an integer and each of y and z is zero or
an integer, and the sum of x, y and z is at least 2 and not
greater than 100, preferably not greater than 50. Within these
limits, the ratio of (x+y):z is preferably as high as possible.In the final product, not only the hydrogen atoms on the
main polyether chain but also those remaining in the groups RF1
to RF4 may be replaced by fluorine.The prior art method of carrying out the said
fluorination as described in EP0247887A is not ideal and the
purpose of the present invention is to provide an improved
method.According to the present invention
there is provided a process for the preparation of a
perfluoropolyether having a general formula:

as defined hereinbefore, which process includes the direct
fluorination with elemental fluorine of a polyether having a
general formula:

as defined hereinbefore, or cyclic polyethers such as crown
ethers, or polyethers selected from diethyl (polyethylene
oxides);
