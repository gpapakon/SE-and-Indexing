<ABSTRACT>
An electric power steering is 
provided with a CPU (1) for outputting a drive control signal of 

an electric motor (5) for assisting the steering force on the 
basis of the detected steering torque, and with a drive inhibition 

circuit (7) for outputting a signal to stop the operation 
of the electric motor when the direction of the electric 

motor operation and the direction of the detected steering 
torque are opposite to each other. The output of the drive 

inhibition circuit is inputted to the CPU, which monitors 
the normal or abnormal condition of the drive inhibition 

circuit.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an electric power 
steering apparatus. More particularly, it proposes an 
electric power steering apparatus with a greater safety. The electric power steering apparatus serves to detect 
the steering torque and to assist the steering force by the 
rotation of an electric motor which is driven according to 
the detected torque. FIG.1 is a block diagram showing an outline construction 
of a conventional electric power steering apparatus. 
The output of a torque sensor 2 provided at the steering 
shaft (not shown) is inputted in a CPU 1 through an AMP 
(amplifier) 3, wherein first the A/D conversion is carried 
out. The CPU 1 stores in its memory a table of the relation 
between the detected torque values and the target values of 
the drive current for an electric motor 5, and reads out the 
target current corresponding to the input torque. In the 
CPU 1, the deviation is calculated between the read-out 
target current and the feedback drive current of the motor 5  
 
which is detected by a drive current detecting resistor 6 
and a drive current detector circuit 9 to be inputted in the 
CPU 1. The deviation is dealt in PI calculation, thereby 
the control variable is calculated, so that the PWM wave 
signal corresponding to the variable and the drive control 
signal indicating the rotary direction of the motor 5 are 
made out to be given to an FET driving circuit 4. The motor 5 is connected to four switch transistors 8a, 
8b, 8c, 8d in a H-bridge and the FET driving circuit 4 
outputs a gate signal respectively to make the transistors 
8a, 8d "on" for the leftward rotation and to make the transistors 
8b, 8c "on" for the rightward rotation. Incidentally, 
the transistors 8c, 8d are always "on" for its rotation 
and the transistors 8a, 8b are driven by the PWM wave signal. A drive inhibition circuit 7 is provided for a countermeasure 
against the runaway in the CPU 1, and the outputs 
from AMP 3 are respectively given to the minus input of a 
comparator 71 and the plus input of a comparator 72. The 
plus input of the comparator 71 and the minus input of the 
comparator 72 are respectively given threshold voltages VR, 
VL corresponding to R, L shown in FIG.2 by a voltage divider 
73. FIG.2 shows a relation between the detected torque 
(axis of abscissas) and the drive current (axis of ordinates)  
 
outputted from the CPU 1 for the motor, and represents 
that the rightward drive of the motor 5 is inhibited 
in case of the detected torque not greater than R including 
the dead
