<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method of 
preventing emesis and treating sexual dysfunction in 
mammals as well as pharmaceutical formulations suitable 
therefor. Extensive research has been conducted for a 
number of years directed toward the development of 
compounds capable of preventing emesis and treating sexual 
dysfunction in mammals. For example, buspirone, 8-hydroxydipropylamino 
tetralin, yohimbine, scopolamine and various 
serotonin-3 antagonists have all been evaluated for 
prevention of emesis. However, to date, such compounds 
have proven unsatisfactory as anti-emetics for a variety of 
reasons including lack of user safety, insufficient 
efficacy, presence of undesirable side-effects and lack of 
broad spectrum anti-emetic activity. Similarly, 
bromocriptine, yohimbine, bupropion, naltrexone, 
methysergide, buspirone and gonadotropin releasing hormone 
have all been evaluated for treating sexual dysfunction. 
Again, to date, such compounds have proven unsatisfactory 
in treating sexual dysfunction for many of the same reasons 
described above.  It is an object of this invention to provide a 
new method for preventing emesis and treating sexual 
dysfunction in mammals, which method comprises 
administering a compound selected from among certain 
tetrahydrobenz[cd]indoles of the general formula 
The tetrahydrobenz[cd]indoles utilized in the instantly 
claimed method are believed to provide a safe, broad 
spectrum, way of preventing emesis and treating sexual 
dysfunction with a minimum of side effects. As such, the 
instantly claimed method is believed to obviate many of the 
defects observed with compounds previously tested for 
treating sexual dysfunction and preventing emesis. Since the present invention provides a new 
method for preventing emesis and treating sexual 
dysfunction in mammals, pharmaceutical formulations 
suitable for such new method will be required. 
Accordingly, a further object of this invention is to 
provide pharmaceutical formulations suitable for use in the 
instantly claimed method.  The objects of the present invention employ 
certain tetrahydrobenz[cd]indoles of the general formula 
Such compounds are known in the art, as described below, 
and have been found to possess various utilities. Flaugh, U.S. Patent No. 4,576,959, discloses 
that the primary amino carboxamide compounds employed in 
the present invention (i.e., those compounds wherein R³ and 
R⁴ are both hydrogen) are central serotonin agonists. As 
such, the compounds are taught to be useful in
