<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a process for isolating
polymers from solutions. More particularly, the invention
relates to a novel process for precipitating polymer resins
as high bulk density solids from solutions by directly
subjecting polymer resin solutions to gaseous carbon
dioxide under moderate pressures at about ambient
temperature.Polymerization reactions generally fall into one
of two classes. The classes are condensation
polymerizations and addition polymerizations. Common to
the above-mentioned polymerization reactions is the
employment of organic solvents as a medium which
comprises the monomers to be polymerized and the polymer
resins to be formed. Thus, the product generally obtained in
polymerization reactions is polymer resins dissolved in
organic solvents (hereinafter polymer resin solutions).Additionally, polymer resins are also found
solubilized in organic solvents as a result of recycling
processes. For instance, a variety of waste polymer resins
such as those obtained from automobile bumpers and
computer casings are frequently recycled. Said waste
polymer resins are often sand blasted to remove paint and
subsequently ground into flakes and powders. The flakes
and powders are then solubilized in organic solvents.
Insolubles such as fillers, metals, paper, impact modifiers 
and coatings are filtered off and polymer resin solutions
which often have soluble components such as dyes,
stabilizers and flame retardants are obtained.It is therefore noted that the instant novel
process is effective for precipitating polymer resins as
high bulk density solids from polymer resin solutions
regardless of how the polymer resins originate in said
solutions. Further, when said polymer resin solutions are
the product of a polymerization reaction, they may often be
referred to as virgin polymer resin solutions.Many of the conventional processes utilized to
isolate polymer resins from solutions are inefficient,
energy intensive as well as environmentally unfavorable.
This is true because the polymer resins that are isolated
via conventional processes are often of low bulk density
since they possess both porous particles and poor particle
size distribution. In addition, they are often contaminated
with low molecular weight compounds such as residual
catalysts and unreacted monomers. Because of this, their
chemical and physical properties (e.g., reactivity, color,
odor and impact strength) are adversely altered. Moreover,
conventional processes employ large volumes of volatile
organic solvents as well as
