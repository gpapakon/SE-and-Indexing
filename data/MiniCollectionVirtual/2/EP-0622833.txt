<ABSTRACT>
Disclosed is an adhesive sheet for wafer comprising a 
substrate film (2) and a radiation curable adhesive layer (3) 

formed thereon, said adhesive sheet being used in a process 
for preparing a semiconductor device comprising the steps 

of adhering a back surface of a wafer (A), a front surface of 
which has been formed a circuit, onto the radiation curable 

adhesive layer, dicing the wafer into chips (A₁,A₂,...), 
rinsing, 

drying, irradiating the adhesive layer with radiation (B) to 
cure said adhesive layer, expanding the adhesive sheet if 

necessary to make the chips apart from each other, then 
picking up the chips, mounting the picked chips on a lead 

frame, bonding, and molding to give such a structure that 
the back surfaces of the chips are partially or wholly in 

contact with a package molding resin, wherein the radiation 
curable adhesive layer comprises 100 parts by weight of an 

acrylic adhesive composed of a copolymer of an acrylic 
ester and an OH group-containing polymerizable monomer and 

50 - 200 parts by weight of a radiation polymerizable 
compound having two or more unsaturated bonds, and the 

radiation curable adhesive layer has an elastic modulus of 
not less than 1 × 10⁹dyn/cm² after curing by irradiation 

with radiation.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an adhesive sheet for
a semiconductor wafer (referred to as "wafer" hereinafter)
and a process for preparing a semiconductor device using
this adhesive sheet. More particularly, the invention
relates to an adhesive sheet which is used for applying and
fixing thereon a wafer having been subjected to wafer
processing in order to dice the wafer into element chips
(referred to as "chips" hereinafter) in a process for
preparing a semiconductor device having such a structure
that the back surfaces of the chips are partially or wholly
in contact with a package molding resin (sealing resin),
and the invention also relates to a process for preparing a
semiconductor device using this adhesive sheet.With higher integration of memories, there have
recently been made a variety of requests to semiconductor
device by users, for example, high speed response,
reduction of electric power consumption, widening of output
word structure and enlargement of package variation. For
coping with these various requests, package designing
should be made flexibly. In order to satisfy the above-mentioned requests,
semiconductor devices of LOC (Lead On Chip) structure have
been proposed, as described in for example "Nikkei
Microdevices" (pp. 89-97, February, 1991) and Japanese
Patent Laid-Open Publication No. 246125/1990. The LOC
structure has various advantages such as minimized size,
high speed response, reduced noise and easy layout, and
hence it is said that the LOC structure is most strikingly
adopted to large-scale semiconductor devices which are
expected to be developed in future.In the LOC structure, as shown in Fig. 7, plural inner
leads of a semiconductor device lead frame (referred to as
"lead frame" hereinafter) are fixed onto a surface of a
chip, on which a circuit has been formed, by way of
insulating tapes which electrically insulate the inner
leads from the chip, and the inner leads are electrically
connected with the chip by a bonding wire. The
semiconductor device is sealed with a molding resin, and
the back surface of the chip is in contact with the molding
resin.The LOC structure has various advantages as described
above, but this structure involves problems which must be
solved because it is entirely different from structures of
conventional packages. One of problems which must be
solved is lowering of reliability caused by separation
between the chips and the molding resin, occurrence of
package cracks, etc. The lowering of reliability caused by occurrence of
package cracks, etc.
