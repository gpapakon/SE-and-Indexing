<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a holding device for a fuel injection valve of a diesel engine, in which a nozzle holder (10) is inserted from above into a chamber (9) situated in the cylinder head (1) and is held by a clip (29). The clip (29) is supported in a seating aperture (28) on the edge of the cylinder head (1) and, under the force of a tightening screw (31) acts as lever on the nozzle holder (10). A pressure duct (33) and a leak-off duct (40) in the clip (29) lead to the nozzle holder (10). Due to the small space required, the clip (29) can be accommodated below a centrally arranged overhead camshaft (6), so that even in such a case a central arrangement of the injection valve (11) relative to the cylinder can be achieved. In addition the invention, at little expense, permits a flow-enhancing alignment of the pressure ducts (33, 17) so that sharp-edged bends can be avoided.

(1), wherein an end cone (38) of the injection pipe (39) is pressed 
sealingly into the conical hollow (36) by a cap nut (37) engaging the 

clamping frame (29). 
Holding device according to claims 1 to 5, characterised in that 
the overflow oil bore (40) ends at the clamping frame (29) near the 

cap nut (37) in a region not covered by the cap nut (37), wherein the 
cap nut (37) in this region comprises a portion (42) of round cross-section 

and the adjacent region of the clamping frame (29) comprises 
a round portion (43) of the same cross-section and these two adjacent 

cylindrical portions (42, 43) are covered sealingly by a shaped
