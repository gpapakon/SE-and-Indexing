<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an automatic assembly systems and 
particularly to a system for the selection and the delivery of preoriented rivets 
or like fasteners to one or more riveting machines. The procedure of assembling parts by means of riveting is largely used in the 
industry; in particular in the aerospace industry. During the evolution of this 
technology, a large number of automatic riveting machines have been 
developed, which according to the parts to be assembled, are able to install 
different kinds of rivets or like festeners and for each kind of them, to finalize 
the choice of different lengths depending upon the thickness of the sheets to 
be jointed. Rivets or like fasteners are usually supplied from a suitable rivet feeding 
system capable to select and send, time by time, to the riveting machine the 
right kind and length of requested rivet. With the development of continuous numeric control (CNC) the later automatic 
riveting machines are capable to assemble a larger number of different parts 
and, for each of them, to storage the program which assigns the position of 
each rivet to be installed. The machines are as well able to accurately finalize 
the correct call of the right kind and length of the rivet to be installed.  Typically the rivet kind is assigned by the designer and memorized inside the 
program while the length is chosen upon measuring, time by time, the thickness 
of the parts to be connected together. Rivets are consequently requested with an unpredictable sequence and they 
must be delivered in a very short time in order to avoid the cycle time to be 
slowed down. Several automatic rivet feed systems are known, in which all rivets of the same 
kind and same length (identical) are storaged inside a preassigned vibratory 
bowl which provides orientation and accumulation of the rivets inside a track, 
usually horizontal, whereby rivets are withdrawn one at a time and 
pneumatically transferred via tube to the riveting machine. In addition to such systems, other automating riveting magazine means are 
known such as spirals or cassettes or other whereas the different rivets are 
inserted and preoriented inside a "cartridge-type" magazine. Such magazines 
feature a certain capacity and usually are mounted close to the riveting 
machine. Both these approaches to the problem of automatically feeding a riveting 
machine by delivering to it, one by one, a preoriented rivet belonging to a 
certain inventory of available rivets, suffer several heavy constraints and/or
