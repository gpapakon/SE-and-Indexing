<DESCRIPTION>
 INSULATOR FOR FLUORESCENT LAMPFIELD OF THE INVENTIONThe present invention relates generally to fluorescent lamps, specifically to fluorescent lamps operating in a reduced temperature or low temperature environment, such as in a refrigerator or freezer case.BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTIONFluorescent lamps are widely used to provide light. Fluorescent lamps are generally preferred over incandescent type lamps because their light output is superior to the light output for the same power of incandescent type lamp. Additionally, fluorescent lamps tend to generate less heat during operation. Fluorescent lamps have found themselves employed in a variety of locations, including high and low temperature applications. Fluorescent lamps used in low temperature applications are difficult to start and continue firing. The low temperature environment reduces the inherent energy available within the gas of the fluorescent lamp. This requires a higher voltage to be applied in order to cause the gas to generate light.There are two main styles of fluorescent lamps currently on the market. One style is a two element fluorescent lamp which consists of a single electrode located at each end of the fluorescent lamp.The second is a filament type which consists of a filament located at each end of the fluorescent lamp. A current flows through each filament, and a voltage of approximately 130V is applied across the two filaments to cause the lamp to light. The current through each of the filaments generates heat, warming the gas surrounding each filament.SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION According to the present invention, insulator material is applied to either one or both ends of a 

fluorescent lamp. The insulator extends slightly beyond the position of the electrode or filament within the fluorescent lamp.It is an object of the present invention to retain the heat generated in a fluorescent lamp within the fluorescent lamp.It is a further object of this invention to reduce the voltage required to be applied to fluorescent lamps to fire the fluorescent lamps. It is a further object of the present invention to enable fluorescent lamps to more reliably and more readily operate in low temperature environments.The insulators of the present invention also provide moisture protection, preventing moisture from collecting at the electrodes located at either end of the fluorescent lamp. This provides additional safety to users of the fluorescent lamp. By preventing moisture from accumulating, the present invention reduces the chance that

CLAIMS
What is claimed is:
1. An insulator for a fluorescent lamp comprising: an insulator material placed over at least one end of a fluorescent lamp to prevent loss of heat generated by the fluorescent lamp.
2. The apparatus described in claim 1 and further comprising a fluorescent lamp having at least one electrode located at either end thereof; and said insulator surrounding at least one end of said fluorescent lamp.
3. The apparatus described in claim 2 in which said insulator extends from the end of said fluorescent lamp towards the center thereof to a point slightly past the location of the electrode/filament within the fluorescent lamp.
4. A method of operating a fluorescent lamp including the steps of: generating a discharge pulse in a ballast; applying said discharge pulse to a fluorescent lamp, generating heat within the fluorescent lamp; insulating said fluorescent lamp to retain the heat generated therein.
5. The method of claim 4 in which the fluorescent lamp is a dual filament type fluorescent lamp.
6. The method of claim 5 and further including the steps of: heating said dual filaments of said fluorescent lamp; and insulating said fluorescent lamp to retain a portion of the heat generated by said filament elements within said fluorescent lamp. 


 7. The method of claim 4 in which said fluorescent lamp operates in an environment having an ambient temperature of less than 7Â°C.
8. The method of claim 4 in which the insulation is applied only near the ends of the fluorescent lamp.
9. An insulator for surrounding the electrode/filament portion of fluorescent lamps used in low temperature applications comprising: an insulator material formed in a shape complimenting the shape of a fluorescent lamp, said insulating material to be placed over at least one end of a fluorescent lamp to prevent loss of heat generated by the fluorescent lamp.
10. The device as described in claim 9 in which the insulator extends from the end of the fluorescent lamp to the end of the electrode/filament within the fluorescent lamp.
