<ABSTRACT>
A device for combining a plurality of measuring tapes at their starting points when taking a bearing on a point which is to be measured in space has a basic body 1 which serves for manipulation and on which there is arranged a track, extending in the shape of a circular arc about an axis, for mounting the appropriately shortened starting points of the measuring tapes. A shaft 2 which ends in a point (tip) 5 to be set on the point 6 which is to be measured is provided on the basic body 1. A separate track 21, 22, 23 moving on a spherical shell 12, 13, 14 is provided for each starting point of a measuring tape. The tracks on the spherical shells have different radii about a common spherical centre which coincides with the point 5 of the shaft 2. The starting points of the measuring tapes are differently shortened in accordance with the different radii.
