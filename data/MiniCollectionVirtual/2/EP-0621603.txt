<ABSTRACT>
The present programming method exploits the close 
dependence of tunneling current on the voltage drop 

(V
ox
) across the tunnel oxide layer, for which purpose, 
a bootstrapped capacitor (3) connected to the drain terminal 

(D) of the transistor (1) is employed, the charge 
state of which determines the bias of the tunnel oxide 

and is in turn determined by the charge state in the 
floating gate (FG). Biasing by the bootstrapped 

capacitor is such as to permit passage of the tunneling 
current (I
TUN
) and, hence, a change in the threshold 
voltage of the transistor until the floating gate 

reaches the desired charge level, and to prevent passage 
of the tunneling current upon the transistor reaching 

the desired threshold. Programming is thus performed 
automatically and to a predetermined degree of accuracy, 

with no need for a special circuit for arresting the 
programming operation when the desired threshold is 

reached.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method and
circuit for tunnel-effect programming floating-gate
MOSFET transistors, and is especially advantageous for
programming nonvolatile EEPROM and flash-EEPROM memories
to which the following description refers purely by way
of example.As we know, of modern solid-state electronic
components, nonvolatile semiconductor memories (in
particular, electrically erasable programmable types)
now rank uppermost by virtue of being able to store and
preserve information for prolonged periods (decades, under
normal operating conditions) even in the absence of
supply, thus providing a solution to all those
applications in which information must be preserved when
the equipment or device to which the memories are
connected is turned off.Nonvolatile memories may be digital or analog (the
latter of more recent and less widespread application),
and generally comprise numerous elementary cells for 
storing an elementary item (a bit in the case of digital
memories, a specific electric level in the case of
analog types). Regardless, however, of the type of
fabrication technology employed, the information stored
in any commercial memory cell is represented by a given
charge (electrons) inside the cell, and more
specifically in a region (floating gate) insulated
electrically from the rest of the cell.In digital applications, the stored charge assumes
two values corresponding respectively to storage of a
logic "0" or "1"; whereas, in the case of analog
memories, the charge varies within certain limits, and
is correlated to the electric level of the signals to be
stored via appropriate read and write circuits.The main problem in programming nonvolatile memory
cells lies in controlling the stored charge.This is particularly important in the case of
analog applications, wherein charge control determines
the resolution and accuracy with which the electric
signal is stored, but is nonetheless important also in
the case of digital memories for minimizing as far as
possible the difference between the charges
corresponding to the two logic states (also referred to
as the write and erase states of the cell) and so
minimizing wear and extending the working life of the
cell. Moreover, in the case of flash-EEPROM memories,
charge control is essential for minimizing read errors
due, for example, to the presence of overerased cells. As we know, the charge of the memory cells in
question is altered by Fowler-Nordheim-effect tunneling
of a thin dielectric layer (EEPROM and flash-EEPROM
cells); and since
