<ABSTRACT>
An X-ray generating system including an X-ray tube for 
generating X-rays and a tube voltage setting unit for 

setting a tube voltage applied to the X-ray tube. The 
system further includes an irradiation time setting unit for 

setting an irradiation time of the X-rays by the X-ray tube, 
a high voltage generating unit for supplying the tube 

voltage to the X-ray tube to cause the X-ray tube to 
generate the X-rays based on the tube voltage, and an 

irradiation control unit connected to the tube voltage 
setting unit and the irradiation time setting unit. The 

irradiation control unit compares the irradiation time with 
a maximum irradiation time determined
 by the tube voltage, 
divides the irradiation time into a plurality of divided 

irradiation times each being equal to or smaller than the 
maximum irradiation time when the irradiation time is larger 

than the maximum irradiation time, calculates a plurality of 
cooling times for the X-ray tube between the divided 

irradiation times and after a final one of the divided 
irradiation times when the irradiation time is larger than 

the maximum irradiation time, and controls the high voltage 
generating unit to cause the X-ray tube to generate the X-rays 

for one of divided irradiation times, respectively, and 
to cause the X-ray tube to suspend irradiation of the X-rays 

for one of cooling times, respectively.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to an X-ray generating system,
e.g. a portable type X-ray generating
system which causes intermittent generation of X-rays for
cooling the X-ray tube.As a prior art X-ray generating system, there is, for
example, the system shown in Figure 10. In this X-ray
generating system, when an X-ray irradiation demand 123 is
outputted from an X-ray ON setting unit 111, a desired tube
voltage (the voltage between the anode and the cathode of an
X-ray tube 105) set value 121 set by a tube voltage setting
unit 101 as tube voltage setting means is outputted to a
tube voltage control unit 102. Tube voltage control unit
102 controls the value of a primary voltage, which is
generated by a primary voltage generating unit 103, from the
difference between tube voltage set value 121 and a tube 
voltage feed-back value 122. The primary voltage generated
by primary voltage generating unit 103 is converted to the
tube voltage required by X-ray tube 105 by a booster 104.
Thus it is designed so that the desired tube voltage is
applied to X-ray tube 105. At the same time, the primary
voltage is converted to tube voltage feed-back value 122
through a primary voltage divider 106, and then it is
outputted to tube voltage control unit 102. Apart from this
operation, when X-ray irradiation demand 123 is outputted
from X-ray ON setting unit 111, an irradiation time monitor
113 starts a down-count from the irradiation time set by an
irradiation time setting unit 112 as irradiation time
setting means. X-ray irradiation continues until an X-ray
irradiation stop demand 125 is outputted by an X-ray OFF
instruction unit 114 or until X-ray irradiation is stopped
by a "Time Up" signal 124 from irradiation time monitor 113.In the operation of this type of X-ray generating
system, heat is generated at the anode of X-ray rube 105
during X-ray generation. In the case of normal X-ray
generating systems such as stationary or floor type, the
design is that, by executing forced cooling through
circulation of water or oil, no damage to the X-ray tube due
to heat occurs, even if X-rays are continuously generated
from the X-ray tube. Accordingly, the prior art normal X-ray
generating system is designed, so that when X-ray
irradiation demand 123 is outputted by X-ray ON setting unit 
111, after irradiating for one maximum irradiation available
time, it is immediately possible to irradiate X-rays.However, in portable type X-ray generating systems,
importance is placed on making the system lighter by
omitting or simplifying the
