<ABSTRACT>
The present invention relates to a water absorbent 
composition comprising 100 parts by weight of water 

absorbing polymer particles and 0.5 to 30 parts of a resin 
powder having heat adhesion property at 50-200°C. The 

present invention also relates to a water absorbing 
material and water absorbing products using the said water 

absorbing material comprising the water absorbing polymer 
particles, a resin having heat adhesion property at 50-200°C 

and fibrous material, wherein the water absorbing polymer 
particles are adhered to the fibrous material through the 

resin by heat treatment at temperature exceeding the 
temperature exhibits heat adhesion property of the resin. 

The water absorbent composition of the present invention 
provides excellent adhesion to a fibrous material, while 

it maintains the water absorbency of the original water 
absorbing polymer, and is consequently useful as raw 

material for sanitary goods such as disposable diapers and 
sanitary napkins etc. The water absorbing material of the 

present invention has excellent water absorbency, 
absorbing speed and shape retention property after water 

absorption. Consequently, it is useful for water 
absorptive goods such as disposable diapers and sanitary 

napkins.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a water absorbent
composition having excellent absorbency and excellent
adhesion to fibrous material. It also relates to a water
absorbing material in which water absorbent resin
particles adhere to a fibrous base. More specifically,
the present invention relates to a water absorbing
material having excellent water absorbency, and excellent
shape retention after water is absorbed.Granular water absorbents which possesses water
absorbing capacity for aqueous solutions, comprising
hydrophilic crosslinked polymers called water absorbent
resins, are known. Examples of these water absorbent
resins include coplymers of starch-acrylic acid salts,
crosslinked acrylic acid salts, crosslinked copolymers of
acrylic acid and/or salts thereof with other monomers,
copolymers of crosslinked isobutylene-maleic acid
anhydride, copolymers of polyvinyl alcohol-(meth)acrylic
acid, modified cellulose derivatives, modified 
polyethylene oxide, modified polyvinyl alcohol, and other
types of polymers. They have been extensively employed in
sanitary goods such as paper diapers, sanitary napkins,
etc.Combined with a fibrous base such as fluff pulp
and/or synthetic fiber, granular water absorbing polymers
as stated above have been used for paper diapers, sanitary
napkins and other water absorbent goods.These conventional granular water absorbing polymers
possess excellent water absorbency, but they exhibit
unsatisfactory adhesion to natural fiber such as fluff
pulp, and also to synthetic fiber such as polyethylene
fibers, polypropylene fibers, polyester fibers, and
bicomponent fibers thereof. In particular, as the ratio
of water absorbing polymer to fiber increases (for
example, when the weight ratio of water absorbing polymer
to fiber exceeds 30/70), the fixation between water
absorbing polymers and fibers decreases, causing problems
of displacement of the water absorbing polymers,
localization of the water absorbing polymers, and
separation of the polymer from fibers.It has been proposed that the entire surface of the
water absorbent be covered with slowly-water-soluble
and/or hydrolyzable thermoplastic resins possessing 
adhesion property to fibers, etc. (Japanese Patent
Application Laid-open No. 242858/1990). This improves the
adhesion property to the fiber, but has the defect that
the water absorbing properties which the water absorbing
polymer originally possessed, in particular the water
absorbing speed and the initial absorption rate, are
excessively degraded. It is, therefore, difficult
