<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a process for the recovery of cobalt from an 
aqueous solution containing nickel and cobalt and, more particularly, relates 
to the separation of cobalt from nickel dissolved in an ammoniacal leach liquor 
to produce a substantially nickel-free cobalt solution from which high purity 
cobalt metal and salt products can be obtained. A hydrometallurgical process for the treatment of nickel-cobalt-copper 
sulphide concentrates and mattes to produce high grade nickel and cobalt 
powders has been in commercial operation for many years. In this process 
which is described in the publication, "The Winning of Nickel". J. R. Boldt, Jr. 
(Ed), Toronto, Longmans Canada Limited, 1967, pages 299 to 314, the nickel 
sulphide feed materials are leached in ammoniacal ammonium sulphate 
solution, under elevated air pressure, in horizontal autoclaves. The metals: 
nickel, cobalt and copper, are dissolved as metal ammine complex ions. Iron 
is oxidized to insoluble hematite, and sulphide sulphur is partially oxidized to 
form a range of unsaturated sulphur anions which remain in the leach solution. 
The hematite residue is filtered off and discarded, and the leach solution is 
treated to remove copper, to partially remove the ammonia, and to oxidize the 
sulphur anions to sulphate. The purified solution, which contains about 60 g/L 
Ni and 1 g/L Co, is then treated with hydrogen under elevated pressure and 
temperature to precipitate nickel selectively as the metal powder. The cobalt 
remains in the reduced solution which contains about 1 g/L Ni and 1 g/L Co. 
The residual metals are then precipitated using hydrogen sulphide to produce 
a mixed nickel cobalt sulphide which forms the feed to the cobalt refining 
process. The recovery of cobalt, in this nickel refining process, is much lower 
than that of nickel, as a result of the adsorption of cobalt by the iron oxide 
leach residue. Furthermore, the selectivity of the reduction process, for nickel, 
depends on the maintenance of a low level of cobalt in the purified leach 
solution. It is only possible to produce nickel powder meeting the market 
specifications for cobalt, if the Ni:Co ratio is maintained above about 20:1. It  
 
will be appreciated therefore that this nickel refining process is not 
economically effective for the treatment of nickel feed materials with high 
cobalt content, since significant losses of cobalt to the leach residue and to the 
nickel powder product will be incurred. A commercial cobalt refining process based on the
