The device consists of at least one electromagnetic loop and an assessment unit and is characterized in that said electromagnetic loop (2) has a small dimension (2) in the direction of vehicle movement or of the roadway axis (X), which is less than the diameter of the vehicle wheels to be identified, and a rectangular shape and/or rectilinear configuration disposed at right angles to the axis (X) of the roadway (1). The loop is sensitive in a distinct and opposite manner to the electromagnetic influences of a vehicle's metallic masses moving in translation and the rotating metallic masses of said vehicle's wheels.
