<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a new silicone-type benzophenone derivative as well as
an ultraviolet light absorbent and an endermic liniment using same, and more particularly to a
new silicone-type benzophenone derivative which highly dissolves in silicone oil, has superior
water resistance and oil resistance, and also has ultraviolet light absorption characteristics with
an absorption wavelength in the UV-AB region.Ultraviolet light is known to cause various changes in skin. In dermatology, the
wavelength spectrum is divided into the long wavelength ultraviolet light region, i.e. 400-320
nm, the medium wavelength ultraviolet light region, i.e. 320-290 nm, and the short wavelength
ultraviolet light region, i.e. 290 nm or less. These regions are referred to as UV-A, UV-B and
UV-C, respectively.Usually, most of the ultraviolet light which people are exposed to is from sunlight. The
part of the ultraviolet light which reaches the earth comprises UV-A and UV-B, while UV-C is
absorbed by the ozone layer and very little of it reaches the earth. Of the ultraviolet light which
reaches the earth, UV-B is known to cause erythema and blisters and accelerate formation of
melanin when the skin is irradiated by more than a certain quantity, while UV-A is known to
darken the skin immediately after the irradiation and also to enhance the skin-degradating action
of UV-B. UV-A is important in terms of prevention of the development and aggravation of liver
spots and freckles.However, research on the action of UV-A on the skin started relatively recently, and only 
dibenzoylmethane derivatives are known as UV-A absorbents. Benzophenone derivatives are
known as UV-AB absorbents which have absorption bands covering both UV-A and UV-B
regions.For the base for endermic liniments, silicone-type bases such as dimethylpolysiloxane are
widely used. This is largely because the silicone-type bases are easy to use, i.e. they spread
well, give a refreshing feeling and are not sticky, and also because of their superior functioning,
i.e. they are not washed away easily by perspiration or water.However, the existing UV-A, UV-B and UV-AB absorbents have very low compatibility
with the silicone-type bases. Therefore, in order to blend them into an endermic liniment with
the silicone-type bases, it was necessary to add an oil base. This made it difficult to fully utilize
the advantages of the silicone-type bases described above.Due to this problem, development of an ultraviolet absorbent which is soluble in silicone
oil and superior in
