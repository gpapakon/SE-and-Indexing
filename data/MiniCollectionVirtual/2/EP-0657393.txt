<ABSTRACT>
A water-resistant film is formed on a transparent 
panel such as an automobile window glass panel by applying a 

coating solution to a surface of a coated region of the 
transparent panel, applying a solvent to a surface of an uncoated 

region of the transparent panel in partly overlapping 
relation to the coating solution applied to the coated region, 

drying the applied coating solution and solvent, and 
thereafter baking the coating solution into a water-resistant 

film.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method of forming 
a water-resistant film on a transparent panel such as a 
glass panel. Known processes of forming a water-repellent film 
on the surface of a glass panel such as an automobile window 
glass panel or mirror glass panel are disclosed in Japanese 
laid-open patent publications Nos. 4-338137, 4-359086, 5-24885, 
and 5-24886, for example. Specifically, Japanese laid-open patent publication 
No. 4-338137 shows use of a solution including substituted 
silicon alkoxide in which part of nonmetal molecules of ceramics 
composed primarily of SiO2 is replaced with a fluoroalkyl 
group, for coating the surface of a glass panel to 
produce a water-repellent film thereon. Japanese laid-open patent publication No. 4-359086 
shows a coating solution prepared by blending a vehicle containing 
a metal alkoxide with a certain amount of 
roalkoxysilane or alkoxysilane. According to Japanese laid-open patent publication 
No. 5-24885, a transparent metal film is interposed between 
the surface of a glass panel and a water-repellent film. According to Japanese laid-open patent publication 
No. 5-24886, a film of SiO2 is formed on the surface of a 
glass panel, which is then etched to produce surface irregularities, 
and a water-repellent film is formed on the surface 
of the glass panel. Various processes are available for coating the 
surface of a glass panel with a solution to produce a water-repellent 
film thereon. They include a dipping process for 
immersing a glass panel in a coating solution, a spraying 
process for spraying a coating solution from a spray gun onto 
a glass panel, a spin-coating process for dropping a coating 
solution onto a glass panel while the glass panel is being  
 
rotated at high speed, thereby to spread the applied coating 
solution uniformly over the glass panel under centrifugal 
forces, and a flow process for flowing a coating solution 
from a nozzle onto an upper edge of a glass panel. Moldings are bonded to the peripheral edges of automobile 
window glass panels or the like with an adhesive 
such as a urethane sealant. A water-repellent film has a 
poor affinity for such an adhesive. For applying an adhesive 
to an automobile window glass panel coated with a water-repellent 
film, it has been customary to apply a masking tape 
to a peripheral edge of the glass panel, apply a coating solution 
to the glass panel, thereafter remove the masking 
tape, and then apply the adhesive to the unmasked edge region. FIG. 4 of the accompanying

A method of forming a water-resistant film on a 
transparent panel, comprising the steps of: 


applying a coating solution to a surface of a region to 
be coated of the transparent panel; at the same time or thereafter 
applying a solvent to a surface of an uncoated region of 
said transparent panel in partly overlapping relation to said 

coating solution applied to said coated region; 
drying the applied coating solution and solvent; 
and 
thereafter baking the coating solution into a water-resistant 
film. 
A method as claimed in claim 1, wherein said coating 
solution is applied by a flow process. 
A method as claimed in claim 1 or claim 2, wherein said 
coating solution and said solvent are applied in partly 

overlapping relation to each other in a region which has a 
width of at least 3mm. 
A method as claimed in any one of the preceding claims, 
further comprising the step of preparing said coating solution 

by mixing tetraethoxysilane, fluoroalkylsilane, ethanol, 
water, and aqueous solution of 0.1N hydrochloric acid, and 

diluting the mixture into a 20% solution. 
A method as claimed in any one of the preceding claims, 
wherein the applied coating solution and solvent are dried 

in a drying chamber at a temperature of 21°C and a humidity 
of 18% with an air flow rate ranging from 0.3 m/min. to 0.5 

m/min. 
A method as claimed in any one of the preceding 
claims,wherein the coating solution is baked in the 

atmosphere at 120°C for 20 minutes and then at 250°C for 1 
hour.
