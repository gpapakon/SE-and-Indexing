<ABSTRACT>
Glass fibres coated with a sizing composition including an aqueous emulsion based on at least one polyolefin grafted with at least one acid or anhydride and neutralized with at least one alcoholamine, at least one aminosilane coupling agent and at least one primary, secondary or tertiary aliphatic monoamine stabilising agent miscible with water and exhibiting a pKb lower than the pKb value of the amine group of the coupling agent plus 1. The glass fibres according to the invention are more particularly intended for the reinforcement of polyolefin matrices such as polypropylene matrices.

Glass fibres for reinforcing 
thermoplastic materials, characterized in that 

they are coated with a sizing composition 
comprising: 


(1) an aqueous emulsion based on at least one 
polyolefin grafted by at least one acid or 

anhydride and neutralized by at least one 
alcoholamine; 
(2) at least one aminosilane coupling agent; 
(3) and at least one primary, secondary, or 
tertiary aliphatic monoamine stabilizing agent 

which is miscible with water and has a pK
b
 value 
lower than the pK
b
 value of the amine group of the 
coupling agent, plus 1. 
Glass fibres according to Claim 1, 
characterized in that the polyolefin or 

polyolefins are polypropylenes, mixtures of 
polypropylenes, or polypropylene derivatives, the 

said polyolefin or polyolefins being homopolymers 
or copolymers.  

 
Glass fibres according to any one of 
Claims 1 and 2, characterized in that the 

polyolefin or polyolefins of the emulsion are 
grafted by at least one maleic anhydride. 
Glass fibres according to one of Claims 1 
to 3 characterized in that the stabilizing agent 

has a pK
b
 value lower than or equal to the pk
b
 
value of the amine group of the coupling agent. 
Glass fibres according to any one of 
Claims 1 to 4, characterized in that the monoamine 

stabilizing agents are present in excess in 
relation to the aminosilane coupling agent or 

agents in the sizing composition. 
Glass fibres according to any one of 
Claims 1 to 5, characterized in that the 

proportion of amines in moles, this proportion 
comprising the alcoholamine or alcoholamines which 

neutralize the polyolefin or polyolefins of the 
emulsion and comprising the monoamine stabilizing 

agent or agents, is at least two times greater 
than that of the aminosilane coupling agent or 

agents in the sizing composition. 
Glass fibres according to any one of 
Claims 1 to 6, characterized in that the monoamine  

 
stabilizing agent is an alcoholamine, an 

alkylamine, or an etheramine such as 
aminomethylpropanol, N-methylethanolamine, 

dimethylamino-methylpropanol, butylamine, or 3-methoxypropylamine. 
Glass fibres according to any one of 
Claims 1 to 7, characterized in that the grafted 

polyolefins are neutralized by at least one 
alcoholamine such as dimethylaminopropanol or 

dimethylethanolamine. 
Glass fibres according to any one of 
Claims 1 to 8, characterized in that the 

aminosilane coupling agent is a mono- or di-aminated 
aminosilane such as a gamma 

aminopropyltriethoxysilane or an N-beta 
(aminoethyl) gamma-aminopropyltriethoxysilane. 
Glass fibres according to any one of 
Claims 1 to 9, characterized in that the sizing 

composition also comprises at least one adhesive 
film-forming agent such as a polyurethane, an 

epoxy polymer or an epoxy-polyurethane copolymer. 
Glass fibres according to any one of 
Claims 1 to 10, characterized in that the sizing  

 
composition also comprises a lubricant and/or a 

wetting agent. 
Glass fibres according to any one of 
Claims 1 to 11, characterized in that the pH of 

the sizing composition is greater than 9. 
Glass fibres according to any one of 
Claims 1 to 12, characterized in that the solids 

content of the sizing composition is between 1 and 
15% by weight. 
Glass fibres according to any one of 
Claims 1 to 13, characterized in that the ignition 

loss rate varies between 0.5 and 1.5%. 
Thermoplastic matrices reinforced by 
glass fibres as defined in Claims 1 to 14.
