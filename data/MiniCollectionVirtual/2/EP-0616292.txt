<ABSTRACT>
The circuit comprises two multiplier modules (M1, M2) each comprising at least one potentiometer (P1, P2) which can be controlled so as to adjust the amplitude ratio between an output signal (Vs, V'2) and an input signal (V1, Vr) of the module. The potentiometers have substantially identical characteristics and are controlled in the same way so that the amplitude ratios of the multiplier modules are substantially equal. One of the modules (M1) receives as input signal the first signal to be multiplied (V1) and delivers an output signal (Vs) proportional to the product of the two operands, whilst the other module (M2) receives as input signal a reference voltage (Vr) and delivers as output signal a feedback signal (V'2) which is locked to a value approximately equal to that of the second signal to be multiplied (V2). Use in electric energy meters.
