<ABSTRACT>
The tube (10) has one or more external fin 
convolutions (21) extending from its external surface 

(12). At intervals along each side surface of the fin 
convolutions (21) there are shoulder notches (41) 

extending from the fin side surfaces. The groove space 
(31) between adjacent fin convolutions (21) has raised 

teeth (32) located circumferentially at intervals. The 
fin convolutions (21) do not extend perpendicularly from 

the tube (10) surface but are inclined, with one 
convolution overlying an adjacent groove (31) but not 

touching its adjacent neighbor fin convolution to form a 
re-entrant boiling cavity with an opening gap (G). In 

one embodiment, the opening gap (G) extends completely 
around the circumference of the tube (10). In another 

embodiment, the curved fin convolutions (21) are 
depressed at intervals around the circumference of the 

tube (10) so that a fin convolution is in close 
proximity to its adjacent neighbor closing the gap (G) 

in the vicinity of the depression. The tube (10) is for 
use in a heat exchanger where heat is transferred 

between a fluid flowing through the tube (10) and a 
fluid flowing around the exterior of the tube (10) and 

where the fluid external to the tube (10) boils during 
the heat exchange process.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates generally to heat exchanger 
tubes. In particular, the invention relates to the external 
surface configuration of a heat exchanger tube that is used for 
evaporation of a liquid in which the tube is submerged. Many types of air conditioning and refrigeration systems 
contain shell and tube type evaporators. A shell and tube 
evaporator is a heat exchanger in which a plurality of tubes are 
contained within a single shell. The tubes are customarily 
arranged to provide a multiplicity of parallel flow paths through 
the heat exchanger for a fluid to be cooled. The tubes are 
immersed in a refrigerant that flows through the heat exchanger 
shell. The fluid is cooled by heat transfer through the walls 
of the tubes. The transferred heat vaporizes the refrigerant in 
contact with the exterior surface of the tubes. The heat 
transfer capability of such an evaporator is largely determined 
by the heat transfer characteristics of the individual tubes. 
The external configuration of an individual tube is important in 
establishing its overall heat transfer characteristics. There are several generally known methods of improving the 
heat transfer performance of a heat exchanger tube. Among these 
are (1) increasing the heat transfer area of the tube surface and 
(2) promoting nucleate boiling on the surface of the tube that 
is in contact with the boiling fluid. In the nucleate boiling 
process, heat transferred from the heated surface vaporizes 
liquid in contact with the surface and the vapor forms into 
bubbles. Heat from the surface evaporates the liquid surrounding 
the vapor bubble and the bubble grows in size. When the 
bubble size is sufficient, surface tension is overcome and the 
bubble breaks free of the surface. As the bubble leaves the 
surface, liquid enters the volume vacated by the bubble and vapor 
remaining in the volume has a source of additional liquid to 
vaporize to form another bubble. The continual forming of 
bubbles at the surface, the release of the bubbles from the  
 
surface and the rewetting of the surface together with the 
convective effect of the vapor bubbles rising through and mixing 
the liquid result in an improved heat transfer rate for the heat 
transfer surface. It is also well known that the nucleate boiling process can 
be enhanced by configuring the heat transfer surface so that it 
has nucleation sites that provide locations for the entrapment 
of vapor and promote the formation of vapor bubbles. Simply
