<ABSTRACT>
A radar indicator comprising a source of radar image 
signals having a first (r,ϑ) format and a digital scan 

converter responsive to the radar image signals for 
converting the radar image signals from the first format 

to digital radar image signals having a second (X - Y) 
format. The digital scan converter includes an image 

memory for supplying the digital radar image signals 
having the second (X - Y) format. A source of external 

video image signals having the second format, including 
video synchronization signals is provided. A 

synchronization signal stripper and clock signal 
generator circuit is responsive to the video 

synchronization signals of the external video image 
signals for generating a clock signal synchronized with 

the synchronization signals of the external video image 
signals. The clock signal is applied to the image memory 

of the digital scan converter for causing controlled 
read-out of the digital radar image signals in a manner 

synchronized with the image signals of the source of 
external video image signal. Video processing circuitry 

responsive to the synchronized digital radar image 
signals develop a radar video signal from the 

synchronized radar image signals, and a video mixer 
circuit mixes in a controlled manner the external video 

image signal with the synchronized radar video signals. 
The mixed external video images with the radar video 

images are subsequently displayed.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to radar indicator 
systems, and in particular, to a radar indicator system 
including a digital scan converter having a memory whose 
read-out is controlled in a manner synchronized with an 
external source of graphic video signals so that direct, 
pixel-by-pixel, mixing of the radar and external graphic 
video signals can be accomplished. Prior radar indicators, such as the AN/SPA-25G 
available from, e.g. Cardion, Inc., Woodbury, NY contain 
an integral scan converter which enables display of radar 
with graphic overlay on a high-resolution, high-contrast 
CRT. This type of radar indicator is designed to 
increase operator functional capability and yet decrease 
workload through efficient man-machine interface. The 
indictor solves all the range, bearing and plotting tasks 
associated with target tracking and navigation. Radar 
input, correlated with internally generated and operator 
selected graphic symbology, provides a tactical display 
for both CIC and bridge environments. Radar systems are 
also known which include digital scan converters, as well 
as external graphic image generation equipment. One such 
equipment is the ASDE-3 (Airport Surface Detection 
Equipment) available from the before noted Cardion, Inc., 
which is used for monitoring ground traffic at various 
domestic and foreign airports. The current prior art solution for combining the 
radar images with the externally generated graphical 
images requires the use of a frame store which receives 
the output of the radar scan converter and a  
 
synchronization circuit having as an input the source of 
external graphic signal and then controls the readout of 
the image frame memory in a manner synchronized with the 
external graphic signal. It is an object of the present invention to provide 
the functionality of the prior art system in a more 
simplified manner and making use, where possible, of 
generally available consumer-type equipment, thereby 
reducing cost without reducing reliability. A radar indicator, comprising:
 
   a source of radar image signals having a first (r,ϑ) 
format;
 
   a digital scan converter responsive to the radar 
image signals for converting the radar image signals from 
the first format to digital radar image signals having a 
second (X - Y) format, the digital scan converter 
including an image memory for supplying the digital radar 
image signals having the second (X - Y) format;
 
   a source of external video image signals having the 
second format, including video
