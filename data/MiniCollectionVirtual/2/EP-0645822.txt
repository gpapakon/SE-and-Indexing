<ABSTRACT>
A variable width FET (field effect transistor) (11) for 
reducing power consumption. The variable width FET (11) 

comprises a FET (18), a switch FET (19), and a switch FET (21). 
The switch FETs (21,19) have a gate, a drain and a source in 

parallel with a gate, a drain, and a source of the FET (18). 
Furthermore, the switch FETs (21,19) each have a control gate 

for enabling the corresponding the device. Enabling the switch 
FETs (21,19) increase the width of the variable width FET (11) 

thereby increasing its power handling capability. Disabling the 
switch FETs (18,19) reduces the width of the variable width 

FET (11) thereby reducing DC bias currents needed which 
reduces power consumption.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates, in general, to power transistors, 
and more particularly to power efficient field effect 
transistors. In general, power transistors are not always operated in a 
power efficient manner, this is especially true for field effect 
transistors (FETs) such as MOSFETSs (metallic oxide 
semiconductor field effect transistors) or MESFETs (metal 
semiconductor field effect transistors). Integrated power FETs 
are generally made as a large single device structure or many 
small FETs coupled in parallel to form a single power FET. 
Typically, the choice of a power FET is determined by the 
maximum power output and the frequency response required. 
The power FET is chosen to meet the maximum power 
requirement even though it is operated at these maximum 
levels infrequently. Since the majority of the power FET 
operation will reside at levels significantly lower than the 
maximum power level of the circuit it will be biased 
inefficiently and waste power. This can be extremely critical 
for battery powered applications where battery life is related 
to the quiescent power dissipated through power FETs. An 
example of a battery application using power FETs is a cellular 
telephone which has an amplifier for transmitting to a 
receiving station. Increasing efficiency of power FETs in the 
transmitting amplifier can significantly extend battery life 
thereby increasing transmission time. It would be of great benefit if a power field effect 
transistor could be developed which meets the maximum power 
requirement of an application yet operates power efficiently.  Briefly stated, this invention comprises a power FET 
(field effect transistor) that includes a gate terminal, a drain 
terminal, a source terminal, and at least one control terminal 
for varying the width of the power FET. The power FET comprises a FET and at least one switch 
FET. The FET includes a gate, a drain, and a source coupled 
respectively to the gate terminal, drain terminal, and source 
terminal of the power FET. Each switch FET includes a gate, a 
drain, and a source coupled respectively to the gate terminal, 
drain terminal, and source terminal of the power FET. Each 
switch FET has a control gate for enabling the device, the 
control gate is coupled to a control terminal of the power FET. 
Each enabled switch FET couples in parallel to the FET for 
increasing the size of the power FET. A method for operating a power FET efficiently. The 
power FET receives a DC bias current. A portion of the power 
FET is operated under
