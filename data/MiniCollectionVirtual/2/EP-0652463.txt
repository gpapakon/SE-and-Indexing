<ABSTRACT>
A counterelectrode for a smart window contains a 
transparent electrically conductive substrate (1, 2) and a 

plurality of electrically conductive dots (11) arrayed on the 
transparent electrically conductive substrate (1, 2). Each of 

the electrically conductive dots (11) contains fine particles 
having capacitance of not less than 1 farad/g or fine 

particles capable of storing electrical charge of not less 
than 1 coulomb/g. A smart window contains the aforementioned 

counterelectrode.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a
smart window utilizing electrochromism.Conventional smart windows are generally constructed
as shown in Figs.6 and 7. The smart window shown in Fig.6 is
called an all solid type and is comprised of a transparent
substrate 61 on which a transparent electrically conductive
film 62, an electrochromic film 63 colored by oxidation (or
reduction), an electrolytic film 64, an electrochromic film 65
colored by reduction (or oxidation) and a transparent
electrically conductive film 66 are provided in this order.
After bonding the transparent electrically conductive film 66
via an intermediate film 60 to a transparent substrate 67, a
surrounding seal 68 is applied and the resulting assembly is
subsequently connected to an electric power source 69. When a
voltage exceeding a certain threshold is applied by the power
source 69 across the transparent electrically conductive films
62 and 66, coloration occurs by the reaction of oxidation or
reduction of the electrochromic film. The smart window shown
in Fig.7 is comprised of a first stack on a transparent
substrate 71 of a transparent electrically conductive film 72
and an electrochromic film 73 colored by oxidation (or
reduction), a second stack on a transparent substrate 77 of a
transparent electrically conductive film 76 and an 
electrochromic film 75 colored by reduction (or oxidation), and an electrolytic film 74,
i.e. an organic electrolyte sandwiched between the first and second stacks. The
operating principle is the same as that of the smart window-shown in Fig. 6. With such
smart window, a WO3 film is preferentially employed as the layer constituting the
electrochromic film colored by reduction in view of practical durability and
electrochromic efficiency. However, as the layer constituting the electrochromic film
colored by oxidation, or an ion storage layer, only NiO, for example has been proposed,
while a material comparable to WO3 in practical durability and electrochromic
efficiency has not been established.US-A-5082594 describes a porous carbon material for use as a polarizable
electrode of a rechargeable battery, double layer capacitor or electrochromic display.
The porous carbon material comprises activated carbon, powdery carbon or carbon
fibers.It is an object of the present invention to provide a smart window having a
counterelectrode which is substantially transparent and which has a sufficiently large
electrochemical capacity per unit area.It is another object of the present invention to provide a smart window which
