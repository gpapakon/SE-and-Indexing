<ABSTRACT>
In the case of this device, the displacement of heavy cable-handling components and the contamination of the blade drive, especially by insulation particles, are largely avoided. For this purpose, the blade drive (50) is arranged above a level which is defined by the cable (25) to be processed, two blade pairs being mounted such that they lie side by side on the operating elements (51, 52) of the blade drive (50). A pivoting device (3) is arranged in a fixed position on a machine frame (1). After the cable (25) has been cut by the first blade pair, one cable end is pivoted with respect to the second blade pair by means of the pivoting device (3), after which the one cable end is stripped by the second blade pair and the other cable end by the first blade pair.
