<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to an inverting delay circuit, i.e. a delay circuit
whose output signal is the product of a negative factor and its input signal.The use of switched capacitor techniques has acquired increased
importance in recent times. A large number of video applications are presently being
investigated, which include multi-standard video comb filters and multi-standard color
decoders. Complex sampled data systems (continuous amplitude, discrete time) can be
produced in the latest standard digital CMOS process with, often, a considerable saving
in chip area with respect to comparable digital systems.With the realization of complex FIR or IIR filters, accurate matching of
coefficients is required. Up till now, a problem in switched capacitor filters has been
the accurate generation of positive and negative filter coefficients, since positive and
negative filter coefficients require inherently different switched capacitor building
blocks for their generation. For instance, in an anti-symmetrical FIR filter, as given by
the following transfer function
H(z) = CM . z0 + CM-1 . z-1 + ... - CM-1 . z-(N-1) - CM . z-N,
the coefficient Ci at one sample instant has to match the coefficient -Ci at another
instant. A similar problem arises in switched capacitor multipliers where exact
matching of positive and negative coefficients is required, for example, when
successive multiplication factors 0, + 1, 0, -1 are used. Present techniques for realizing
an inverting delay either cause distortion (gain errors and clock feed-through) or
require an extra buffer or amplifier for realization.Electronics Letters, 11th May 1989, Vol. 25, No. 10, pp. 623-625
shows several switched capacitor delay circuits, none of them multiplying by a negative
coefficient.US-A-4,644,304 discloses a switched-capacitor pseudo-N-path filter that
includes an analog integrator circuit having an input, an output, and a feedback
capacitor connected between the input and the output. A plurality of storage capacitors
are connected across the feedback capacitor, and an input capacitor is provided. A
switching circuit selectively connects the input capacitor across electrical ground and
between an input signal and the input of the integrator circuit, and also selectively
connects the feedback capacitor and, in turn, one of the storage capacitors between the
input of the integrator circuit on the one hand, and either electrical ground or the
output of the integrator circuit on the other hand. It is, inter alia, an object of the invention to
