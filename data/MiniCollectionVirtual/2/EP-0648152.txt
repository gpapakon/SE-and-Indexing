<ABSTRACT>
Casting equipment for continuous or semi-continuous water casting of metal (DC casting), in particular casting of roll blocks of aluminium. The casting equipment comprises a casting die (1) which has an open inlet (8) for supplying molten metal and a cavity (9) with an open outlet (16), where means of supply are provided including a continuous gap (3) along the circumference of the casting die for the supply of water for direct cooling of the molten metal in connection with the formation of a cast billet (2), and means (4) for the supply of gas or air to reduce the cooling effect, at least during the start phase of the casting process. Another gap (4) is provided within the water gap (3) and predominantly in parallel with the latter, passing along the circumference of the casting die, for supplying air or gas in such a way that a skirt of air/gas (15) is formed which is designed to deflect the skirt of water (14) and/or form an air cushion between the skirt of water (14) and the cast billet (2).

<DESCRIPTION>
Casting equipment for casting metalThe present invention concerns casting equipment for continuous or semi-continuous water casting of metal (DC casting) , in particular casting billets of aluminium for milling purposes, comprising a casting die which has an open inlet for the supply of molten metal and a cavity with an open outlet in which are arranged means for supplying water for direct cooling of the molten metal and means for supplying gas or air to reduce the cooling effect, at least during the start phase of the casting process.By using various methods, it has been shown that reduced cooling in the start phase of DC cooling of metal gives a positive effect with regard to shrinkage, start cracks and surface quality. It is also probable that it has a positive effect on the formation of so-called "club feet".In a known method which is disclosed in US patent No. 4.693.298, air is added to the water before it leaves the water gap which passes along the circumference of the casting die opening. The direction of inlet of the air in relation to the water is approximately 90Â° so that air bubbles are produced in the water flow, i.e. the air is mechanically mixed with the water in the water flow. By replacing some of the volume of water with air as stated here, the intention is to achieve a uniform skirt of water with less water than is normally required to maintain a uniform skirt of water and, by means of the air, to achieve an insulating effect. The addition of air will, however, with otherwise unchanged conditions, increase the speed of the water and thus also the cooling effect of a given quantity of water as the cooling water will pass through the steam phase on the surface of the cast billet more quickly. The reduction in the cooling effect by adding air to the cooling water before it leaves the water gap as stated in the above Norwegian patent application, is therefore 

 limited. Moreover, the solution as shown in the above patent offers few opportunities for differentiated cooling, i.e. different cooling for one area in relation to another area in the casting die.In another similar known solution which is described in US patent no. 4.166.495, C02 is added to the cooling water instead of air. When the water leaves the water gap in the casting die, very small bubbles of C02 will be formed on account of the pressure drop and the increase in temperature. The C02 bubbles form a partly insulating layer between the cast billet and the cooling water so that the overall cooling area is reduced. This method
