Current mirror, in which an input current (e) is 
passed via the series-connected load paths of a first and 

second transistor (1, 2) to a first supply potential (p) 
as well as to the control terminals of the first and 

second transistors (1, 2) as well as of a third, fourth, 
fifth, sixth, seventh and eighth transistor (3 to 8), in 

which the load paths of the third and fourth transistors 
(3, 4) as well as of a ninth and tenth transistor (9, 10) 

are connected in series between the first supply potential 
(p) and a second supply potential (n), the control 

terminals of the ninth and tenth transistors (9, 10) as 
well as of an eleventh, twelfth and thirteenth transistor 

(11, 12, 13) being connected to the tap between the third 
and ninth transistors (3, 9), in which the load paths of 

the fifth, sixth and eleventh transistors (5, 6, 11) as 
well as of a fourteenth transistor (14) are connected in 

series between the first and second supply potentials (p, 
n), the control terminals of the fourteenth transistor 

(14) as well as of a fifteenth and sixteenth transistor 
being connected to the tap between the sixth and eleventh 

transistors (6, 11), in which the load paths of a seventeenth 
transistor (17) as well as of the seventh, twelfth 

and fifteenth transistors (7, 12, 15) are connected in 
series between the first and second supply potentials (p, 

n), the control terminals of the seventeenth transistor 
(17) as well as of an eighteenth transistor (18) being 

connected to the tap between the seventh and twelfth 
transistors (7, 12), in which a first output current (a), 

which is proportional to the input current (e), can be  
 

picked off from the first supply potential (p) via the 
series-connected load paths of the eighteenth and eighth 

transistors (18, 8), in which a second output current 
(a') which has the same magnitude as the first output 

current (a) can be picked off from the second supply 
potential (n) via the series-connected load paths of the 

sixteenth and thirteenth transistors (16, 13), and in 
which the ninth to sixteenth transistors (9 to 16) are of 

one conduction type and the seventeenth, eighteenth and 
first to eighth transistors (17, 18, 1 to 8) are of the 

other conduction type. 
Current mirror according to Claim 1, characterized 
in that provision is made exclusively of field-effect 

transistors, the ratio of channel width to channel 
length in the second, fourth, fifth and tenth transistors 

(2, 4, 5, 10) being equal to a third of the ratio of 
channel width to channel length in the seventeenth and 

eighteenth and fourteenth, fifteenth, sixteenth 
transistors (17, 18, 14, 15, 16). 
Current mirror according to Claim 1 or 2, characterized 
in that the second, fourth and fifth transistors 

(2, 4, 5), the third and sixth transistors (3, 6), the 
seventh and eighth transistors (7, 8), the twelfth and 

thirteenth transistors (12, 13), the fifteenth and 
sixteenth transistors (15, 16) as well as the seventeenth 

and eighteenth transistors (17, 18) are in each case 
constructed identically. 
Current mirror according to Claim 1 or 2, characterized 
in that the second, fourth, fifth, seventeenth 

and eighteenth transistors (2, 4, 5, 17, 18) together, 
the first, third, sixth, seventh and eighth transistors 

(1, 3, 6, 7, 8) together, the ninth, eleventh, twelfth 
and thirteenth transistors (9, 11, 12, 13) together as 

well as the tenth, fourteenth, fifteenth and sixteenth 
transistors (10, 14, 15, 16) together in each case have 

the same channel lengths, and in that the second, fourth 
and fifth transistors (2, 4, 5) together, the fourteenth, 

fifteenth and sixteenth transistors (14, 15, 16)  
 

together, the first, third, sixth, seventh and eighth 
transistors (1, 3, 6, 7, 8) together, the seventeenth and 

eighteenth transistors (17, 18) together as well as the 
ninth, eleventh, twelfth and thirteenth transistors (9, 

11, 12, 13) together in each case have the same channel 
widths.
