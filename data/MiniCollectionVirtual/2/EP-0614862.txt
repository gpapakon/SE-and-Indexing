<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to explosive compositions of matter and is 
particularly directed to explosive compositions including halogenated 
components and organic nitramine compounds and other energetic chemical 
groups. High energy explosives and propellants such as disclosed in U.S. 
Patent No. 5,045,132 are generally formulated to include a high energy 
binder and oxidizer, together with suitable plasticizers. These 
ingredients must have a favorable preferably positive heat of formation 
and be oxygen-rich in order for high performance to be met. Moreover, 
these ingredients must have thermal and shock stability in order to permit 
safe storage and handling.  The disadvantages of known explosive compositions such as thermal and 
shock instability are overcome with the new explosive compositions of the 
present invention. To improve the high energy potential and improve insensitivity of 
explosive compositions when the heat release factor is reduced, the 
present invention contemplates performance-improved, less 
detonation-sensitive formulations. The advantages of the present invention are realized in explosive 
formulations utilizing a select binder and oxidizer in combination with 
high-energy constituents. Accordingly, an object of the present invention is to provide 
improved high-energy explosive compositions or formulations. Another object of the present invention is to provide high-energy 
explosive compositions having a lessened detonation sensitivity and 
enhanced performance. These and other objects and features of the present invention will be 
apparent from the following detailed description. Figure 1 is a graph of the plate dent of the theoretical detonation 
velocity times the explosive mass for a selection of explosive materials.  According to the present invention, new cast curable insensitive 
explosives are provided comprising select oxidizers with high density 
binders which binder constituent replaces a portion of the sensitive 
explosive. The binder constitutent further comprises a select halogenated 
polymer, a halogenated plasticizer, glycidyl azide polymer (U.S. Patent 
No. 4,268,450), and mixtures thereof. Additional ingredients, including a 
curative and a cure catalyst may be included in the explosive formulation. 
Substitution of all or a portion of the sensitive explosive with an 
elastomeric binder decreases the overall brittleness of the grain, leading 
to further reduced sensitivity of the explosive. In addition, select 
levels of binder allow for production of
