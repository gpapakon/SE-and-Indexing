<ABSTRACT>
The leaf switch of the invention consists of an optical switch mounted on a 
printed circuit board having electrical conducting means imbedded therein. 

An opto-interrupter is mounted on an actuator arm (14) that is moved by the 
player controlled button to close the optical switch and complete the 

electrical circuit. To complete more than one circuit, a plurality of optical 
switches are provided with the opto-interrupter mounted on the actuator arm 

associated with each optical switch. The opto-interrupter is configured such 
that different ones of the switches are closed depending on how far the 

player controlled button is depressed.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates, generally, to pinball games 
and, more particularly, to an improved leaf switch for such 
games. As shown in Figures 1 and 2, a typical leaf switch 
consists of a pair of flexible electrical leaf contacts 2 and 4 
connected to wires 6 and 8, respectively, that lead to a solenoid 
that activates a flipper or other playfield device or signals the 
games microprocessor. The electrical leaf contacts 2 and 4 are 
supported between a number of insulating elements 5 and include 
contact pads 10 and 12, respectively, that are arranged opposite 
to one another and are intended to make contact to complete an 
electrical circuit. Depending on the purpose of the switch the 
assembly can be secured to the playfield or sidewall of a pinball 
game cabinet by screws 9 that extend through insulating plastic 
sleeves 7. A flexible actuator arm 14 is also supported between 
insulating pads 5. Actuator arm 14 is typically contacted by a 
ball or a player manipulated flipper button such that when the  
 
button is depressed, actuator arm 14 forces pad 12 into contact 
with pad 10 to complete an electrical circuit and energize the 
associated solenoid. As will be apparent, the prior art switch requires the 
assembly of numerous mechanical components. As a result, the 
manufacturing process is cumbersome and time consuming. 
Moreover, because of the numerous components, it is difficult to 
properly align the components during installation. Finally, the 
mechanical contact between the components such as pads 10 and 12 
can cause wear and pitting. As a result, reliable electrical 
contact may deteriorate over time. Figure 3 shows the prior art switch used in systems 
where a single player operated button is used to actuate more 
than one pair of contracts, as for example to control more than 
one flipper. This system is similar to that shown in Figures 1 
and 2 except that an additional electrical contact 15 is provided 
that completes a circuit when it contacts electrical contact 2. 
Contacts 15 and 2 are provided with pads 17 and 18, respectively, 
that complete another electrical circuit. When actuator arm 14 
is depressed by the player controlled button, pads 10 and 12 will 
touch to activate a first flipper and if actuator arm 14 is 
depressed further, pads 17 and 18 will touch to activate a second 
flipper. The multi-flipper system of Figure 3 has the same  
 
problems as the system of Figure 1 compounded by the additional 
components of the extra electrical contact. The use of opto-interrupters in

<CLAIMS>
An optical leaf switch assembly for activating a flipper of a pinball game comprising: 

a) a first optical detector (22) consisting of a light emitter (26) and a light 
receiver (28) for detecting the light from said emitter (26) and for 

completing a circuit in response thereto; 
b) at least one flipper (31) located in said circuit, said flipper (31) being 
actuated when said circuit is complete. 
c) interrupter means (42) movable between a first, blocking position in 

which light is prevented from reaching the receiver (28) and a second 
position in which light from the emitter (26) is allowed to reach the 

receiver (28), said interrupter means (42) being mounted on a leaf spring 
actuator arm (40) that is normally biased to said first position; and 
d) a player operated button (44) operatively connected to said actuator arm 
for moving said interrupter means (42) to the second position. 
The optical leaf switch assembly according to claim 1, further comprising a 
second optical detector (24) consisting of a light emitter (26) and light detector 

(28), said interrupter means (42) configured to operate said second optical 
detector (24) intermediate said first and second position.  

 
An optical leaf switch assembly according to claim 2, wherein the interrupter 
means (42) has a stepped profile.
