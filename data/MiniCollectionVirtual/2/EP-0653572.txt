<ABSTRACT>
The instant invention concerns a highly adhesive 
sucker with a central area (2) of considerable thickness 

to which there are provided concentrically - from the 
inside towards the outside - a groove (4), a hollow rib (5), a 

second groove (6) which is not as wide and not as deep as 
the first groove (4), as well as a second rib (7) positioned 

at the perimetral edge, which is not as wide or high 
as the innermost rib (5): it being provided that on the 

lower face of the sucker there exists a groove (5a), 
directly underneath the rib (5), which delimits a flat 

annular band from the inside.

<DESCRIPTION>
The instant invention concerns a highly adhesive 
sucker to be used preferably for baggage racks on 
motor vehicles. The invention was conceived in order to solve a 
problem which emerged in the use of a particular 
sucker type of baggage rack for motor vehicles, even 
if it is structured in such a way as to also be 
practical and suitable in a different context and for 
other uses. More particularly, there have been in existence for 
some time now, sucker type appliances, to be fitted to 
the roof or the bonnet of motor vehicles, on which 
suitcases, parcels, skis, surfboards and other items 
can be secured. Normally, said appliances have a box shaped body with 
a circular base and are of negligible height, with 
eyelets to which to secure the rope or belts which 
hold in place the objects to be transported; below 
said box shaped body there is provided a traditional 
sucker, with a circular shape, which is activated by 
means of a lever fitted to the side of the box shaped 
body in order to secure the entire appliance in a 
stable manner to the bodywork of the vehicle. It is possible to determine the grip of the sucker on 
the roof or the bonnet of the vehicle or 
alternatively, its detachment thereof, by means of 
this small lever. Obviously, in order to obtain optimal stability of the 
objects to be transported on the outside of a vehicle, 
it is usually necessary to use two, four or more of 
these appliances.  Said appliances have proved to be quite practical and 
functional; in fact they are also quite cheap, easy 
and rapid to fit, and moreover they do not jeopardise 
in any substantial manner the aerodynamics of the 
vehicle in motion. However, the use of said appliances has been limited 
by the fact that a considerable practical problem has 
emerged: in fact, it so happens that the suckers with 
which said baggage racks have been fitted to date, are 
not able to adhere to the surface below in an entirely 
secure manner. In other words, it has been observed that said suckers 
have a tendency to detach themselves, especially if 
they are not in a perfect state of maintenance, when 
the load is particularly heavy and when the vehicle is 
travelling at a certain speed. It is evident how a problem of this nature, with all 
the related risks, can substantially limit the 
commercial distribution of the baggage racks in 
question, not only because of the natural perpelxity 
of consumers, but also because in certain countries, 
the Authorities responsible for evaluating the safety 
standards of all such

1) Highly adhesive sucker, of the type with a central 
metallic disc (3), fitted with gripping clips (3a) 

protruding from the central area (2) of the article, 
characterised by the fact that concentrically to this 

said circular central zone (2), it has, from the 
inside towards the outside, a groove (4), a hollow rib 

(5) of about the same width as the above groove (4) 
and of the same height as the thickness of the central 

area (2), a second groove (6) which is less wide and 
not as deep as the first groove (4), as well as a 

second rib (7), at the perimetral edge, which is not 
as wide or as deep as the innermost hollow rib (5); it 

being provided that on the lower face of the sucker 
(1), there is a groove (5a), directly underneath the 

rib (5), which delimits a flat annular band (8) from 
the inside.
