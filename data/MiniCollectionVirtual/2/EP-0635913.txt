<ABSTRACT>
A miniature motor has a tubular case (1) closed at 
one end and a permanent magnet (2) fitted to the inner 

surface thereof. A case cap (6) closes the open end of 
the case, and a rotor (5) with an armature (3) and a 

commutator (4) is rotatably supported by bearings (9,10) 
provided on each end of the case (1). Brushes for 

making sliding contact with the commutator (4) are 
supported on the case cap (6). The atmosphere enclosed 

within the motor comprises a polymer having a molecular 
weight of 250 to 5000.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a miniature motor of the
type commonly used in for example, audio and video
equipment, and in precision equipment of many kinds.In a miniature motor, the brushes and the
commutator may wear out quickly as a result of arcing or
Joule heating, generated at the sliding contact area
between the brushes and the commutator or because of the
physical contact therebetween. This abnormal wear can
adversely affect the electrical connection between the
brushes and the commutator, reducing the stability of
the motor and therefore shortening its service life.
The presence in such a motor of an atmosphere comprising
an organic gas can lead to the production of black
insulating polymers on the sliding contact area between
the brushes and the commutator, as a result of arcing or
Joule heating as mentioned above. These insulating
polymers may make the contact between the brushes and
the commutator unstable, increasing the contact
resistance. This can also reduce the service life of
the motor.European Patent Specification No. 0 209 617
discloses a small electric motor in which the case is
filled with an atmosphere containing vapour of one or
more specified organic compounds. U.S. Patent No.
2 703 372 is also concerned with the introduction of
vapours into electrical machines particularly in the
regions of the machine where there is sliding electrical
contact.In Japanese Published Unexamined Patent Application
No. Sho-60 (1985)-162449 a motor is disclosed in which a
polyvalent alcohol is enclosed within the case. While
this results in some improvement in motor performance in
the above respects, because its molecular weight is low
the polyvalent alcohol readily evaporates, making its
atmosphere in the motor case short-lived. Thus, the 
polyvalent alcohol does not have a lasting effect.The present invention is directed at a miniature
motor in which abnormal wear, as described above, of the
sliding contact surface of the commutator is at least
reduced, and the generation of contaminating polymers
caused by sliding contact between the commutator and the
brushes can be substantially avoided.A motor of the type to which the invention relates
has a metallic tubular case closed at one end with a
permanent magnet fitted to the inner surface thereof; a
case cap fitted to the open end of the case; a rotor
comprising an armature and a commutator, and being
rotatably supported by bearings provided on the closed
end of the case and on the case cap; brushes supported
on the case cap for making sliding contact
