<ABSTRACT>
A method for compensating toxicity test data for the measured toxicity of a reference sample consists of the steps of: a) obtaining toxic response data for a plurality of concentrations of at least two different test samples, including reagent controls having zero sample concentration for each sample; b) defining the sample having the smallest toxic response at high concentrations as the reference sample; c) computing the toxic response of the test sample relative to that for the reference sample for at least two concentrations in accordance with the equation: relative gamma =  GAMMA R = (LSC/LSX)(LRX/LRC)-1, where LSC = light output of the test sample control (i.e. for X = 0), LSX = light outputof the test sample for concentration X, LRX = light output of the reference sample for concentration X, LRC = light output of the reference sample control (i.e. for X = 0); and d) generating a dose-response curve of concentration versus relative  GAMMA  (gamma) for at least two corresponding concentrations of the two samples.

<DESCRIPTION>
 METHOD OF COMPENSATING TOXICITY TEST DATA FOR THE MEASURED TOXICITY OF A REFERENCE SAMPLEField Of The InventionThis invention relates to the compensation of test data, during data reduction, for the existence of poten¬ tially interfering materials and/or conditions and more particularly to the compensation of data generated during the quantitative measurement of the toxicity of a substance relative to a chosen reference sample.Background of the InventionSoil and sediment toxicity test methods currently in use (cf. Geisy, John P. and Robert A Hoke, Freshwater Sedi¬ ment Toxicity Bioassessment: Rationale For Species Selection And Test Design, in J. Great Lakes Res. 15(A): 539-569) include: a. the use of benthic organisms (which spend a signif- icant portion of their lives in contact with sediments or soils) such as midges (mayfly larvae), clam larvae and earthworms, using parameters ranging from weight gain to percentage of test organisms surviving a timed exposure (days) to the solid particulate samples as the measure of toxic effect; b. measurement of the toxic effects on algae; c. determination of the effect on germination of seeds, and the growth rate of roots of sprouting seeds; d. determination of the effect on fertilization of sea urchin eggs; e. determination of lethality to higher organisms (e.g. mysid shrimp, dahpnia, fish) during a timed exposure (days), to either water or organic solvent (diluted with water) elutriates from the solid particulate samples; f. changes in the light output of bioluminescent micro¬ organisms when exposed to sample elutriates for relatively short times, such as 5 to 30 minutes (the Microtox System, marketed by Microbics Corporation. Carlsbad, Ca. ) ; 

 g. bioluminescent bacteria in direct contact with the solid particulate sample for about 20 minutes (the method of K. K. Tung, et al. , described in U.S. Pat. Appln. Ser. No. 07/682,923), which enhances response to sparsely soluble toxicants, a kit for the performance of which is currently being marketed by Microbics Corporation as the "Solid-Phase Test" .These methods, except the tests using benthic organ¬ isms, are all based on the well established art of testing water for acute toxicity. The most recent adaptation of a water acute toxicity test for the testing of solid particu¬ late samples is the bioluminescent microorganism test uti¬ lizing direct contact between the solid particulate sample and the test microorganism, with filter separation of micro- organisms from particulates before light readings are taken
