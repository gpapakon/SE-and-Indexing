<DESCRIPTION>
An optical element combining a spherical surface and a 
diffraction grating. It is known to make lens arrays of a pattern of 
spherical lenses forming a surface of a substrate by 
forming a spherical surface on one end of each of a 
plurality of rods, which are then combined, as by bundling 
and fusion or sealing; or, as in U.S. Patents 4,572,611 
and 4,952,026. In some important applications, such as coupling light 
from a laser diode array to a waveguide fiber array, the 
light gathering efficiency is crucial. This latter 
efficiency is measured by the numerical aperture, NA, of 
the lens. For ease of discussion, this will be taken as 
the radius of the lens divided by its focal length. In 
general, values on the order of 0.5 are required, but the 
processes described by U.S. Patent 4,572,611 achieve only 
half that requirement Furthermore, the light must be efficiently coupled to 
the output fiber array. The size of the image formed by a 
lens must conform to that of the single mode optical fiber 
or detector. This often requires near diffraction-limited 
performance wherein the size of the focused spot is limited 
only by diffraction and not by geometric optic effects. 
The theoretical diffraction-limited spot size is given by 
the expression,

S = 1.22 λ NA

 
 
where λ is the wavelength of light and NA is the numerical 
aperture. The requirements of both high NA and 
diffraction-limited performance make the use of 
conventional spherical lenses inefficient. As the NA increases, the radius of curvature of the 
lens decreases. The deviation of the wavefront produced by 
a spherical lens, compared to a perfect spherical 
wavefront, which would yield the diffraction-limited spot 
size, then increases to the third power of the radial 
distance from the center of the lens. This deviation is usually dealt with in terms of 
specific types called aberrations. The particular one 
which most impacts the application discussed above is 
termed spherical aberration. The rays imaged from near the 
top of the lens, marginal rays, come to a focus closer than 
those which come from near the center of the lens, paraxial 
rays. The net result is a blurring of the image. There are a number of ways one can approach the 
problem of correcting for the aberration. The classic 
solution is to use a number of spherical lens surfaces, 
that is, essentially a compound lens approach. This can be 
done with the lens arrays produced by the Bellman et al. 
processes. There, two bi-convex arrays are stacked 
together, thus
