<ABSTRACT>
A method for isolating a gene, comprising: (i) isolating a cell possessing a post-translational characteristic of interest, said post-translational characteristic being the presence of a membrane-bound oligosaccharide or polysaccharide of interest on the surface of said cell, the presence of a soluble oligosaccharide or polysaccharide of interest in an extract of said cell, or the presence of a particularly glycosyltransferase activity in an extract of said cell; (ii) creating a genetic library of either cDNA or genomic DNA from the genetic material of said isolated cell; (iii) transforming host cells with said genetic library; and (iv) screening said transformed host cells for a host cell containing said post-translational characteristic, thereby obtaining a cell containing said gene, is disclosed. The method can be used to obtain genes encoding glycosyltransferases.

<DESCRIPTION>
 DescriptionCloning and Expression of a Human Î±(l,3)Fucosyltransferase, FucT-VIThis application is a continuation-in-part of U.S. Patent Application Serial NO. 07/715,900, filed June 19, 1991, which is a continuation-in-part of U.S. Patent Application Serial No. 07/627,621, filed December 12, 1990, now abandoned, which was a continuation-in-part of U.S. Patent Application Serial No. 07/479,858, filed February 14, 1990, now abandoned.Technical Field:The present invention relates to methods and products for the synthesis of oligosaccharide or polysaccharide structures, on glycoproteins, glycolipids, or as free molecules.Background Art:Carbohydrates are an important class of biological compounds which are remarkable for their structural diversity. This diversity is not random but rather consists of specific sets of oligosaccharide structures that exhibit precise tissue-specific and developmental expression patterns. In cells carbohydrates function as structural components where they regulate viscosity, store energy, or are key components of cell surfaces. Numerous site specific intercellular interactions involve cell surface carbohydrates. For example, union of sperm and egg as well as the implantation of fertilized egg are both mediated by cell surface carbohydrates. Likewise, a number of proteins that function as cell adhesion molecules, including GMP-140, Endothelial Leukocyte Adhesion Molecule-1 (ELAM-1) ,and lymphocyte adhesion molecules like Mel-14, exhibit structural features that mimic 

lectins, and are now known to bind specific cell surface carbohydrate structures (Feizi, Trends Biochem. Sci. (1991) .16:84-86) . Glycosylated proteins as tumor-associated antigens are now being used to identify the presence of numerous carcinomas. Even isolated oligosaccharides have been found to exhibit biological activity on their own.Specific galactose oligosaccharides are known to inhibit the agglutination of uropathogenic caliform bacteria with red blood cells (U.S. Patent No. 4,521,592). Other oligosaccharides have been shown to possess potent antithrombic activity by increasing the levels of plasminogen activator (U.S. Patent No. 4,801,583). This same biological activity has been used, by binding oligosaccharides, in conjunction with an amino glycoprotein, in medical instruments to provide medical surfaces which have anticoagulation effects (U.S. Patent No. 4,810,784). Still other oligosaccharides have found utility as gram positive antibiotics and disinfectants (U.S. Patent Nos. 4,851,338 and 4,665,060).
