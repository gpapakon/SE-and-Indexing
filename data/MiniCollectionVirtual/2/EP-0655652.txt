<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method for printing by using
dampening solutions and lithographic printing plates obtained
according to the silver salt diffusion transfer process.
Furthermore the present invention relates to the use of said
dampening solutions with said lithographic printing plates.The principles of the silver complex diffusion transfer reversal
process, hereinafter called DTR-process, have been described e.g. in
US-P 2,352,014 and in the book "Photographic Silver Halide Diffusion
Processes" by André Rott and Edith Weyde - The Focal Press - London
and New York, (1972).In the DTR-process non-developed silver halide of an
information-wise exposed photographic silver halide emulsion layer
material is transformed with a so-called silver halide solvent into
soluble silver complex compounds which are allowed to diffuse into
an image-receiving element and are reduced therein with a developing
agent, generally in the presence of physical development nuclei, to
form a silver image having reversed image density values
("DTR-image") with respect to the black silver image obtained in the
exposed areas of the photographic material.A DTR-image bearing material can be used as a planographic
printing plate wherein the DTR-silver image areas form the
water-repellant ink-receptive areas on a water-receptive
ink-repellant background. For example, typical lithographic printing
plates are disclosed e.g. EP-A-423399 and EP-A-410500.The DTR-image can be formed in the image-receiving layer of a
sheet or web material which is a separate element with respect to
the photographic silver halide emulsion material (a so-called
two-sheet DTR-element) or in the image-receiving layer of a
so-called single-support element, also called mono-sheet element,
which contains at least one photographic silver halide emulsion
layer integral with an image-receiving layer in waterpermeable
relationship therewith. It is the latter mono-sheet version which is
preferred for the preparation of offset printing plates by the DTR 
method.According to the preferred embodiment of the mono-sheet DTR-offset
printing plate, disclosed in e.g. US-P-4,722,535 and
GB-P-1,241,661, a flexible support e.g. of paper or of an organic
resin is provided in the order given with a silver halide emulsion
layer and a layer containing physical development nuclei serving as
the image-receiving layer. After information-wise exposure and
development the imaged element is used as a printing plate without
the removal of the now-useless emulsion layers.Said type
