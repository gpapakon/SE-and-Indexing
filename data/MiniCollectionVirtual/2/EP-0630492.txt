<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a color photographic 
processing method, and uses of a product for color photography 
comprising, in addition to the conventional light-sensitive 
silver halide layers, a top layer which is insensitive to 
light. US Patent 4 596 764 describes a photographic 
processing method which consists of bringing into contact, 
during the photographic processing, a product comprising 
light-sensitive silver halide emulsion layers with a high 
iodide content and an emulsion layer which is not sensitive 
to light with an amino compound (I) of the formula: 
 
wherein M represents a hydrogen atom, an alkali metal, an 
alkaline earth metal, a quaternary ammonium group, a 
quaternary phosphonium group, an amidino group or a group 
of the formula 
 
wherein R1 and R2 each represent separately a hydrogen atom 
or an aliphatic group, and m represents an integer between 
2 and 4; or with a strong acid salt. The protective layer described in this patent 
comprises a fine-grain emulsion with an iodide content of 
less than 3 % molar, the quantity laid down to form this 
top layer being between 50 and 140 % molar of the total 
quantity of silver iodide in the light-sensitive layers.  
 
It is clear in the art that when a photographic product 
contains a large quantity of silver iodide, the fixing has 
a reduced efficiency related to the low solubility of the 
silver iodide. The method described in the patent cited 
above proposes to avoid the problem encountered during the 
fixing stage by processing the color photographic product 
described above in the presence of a compound (I). The examples in US Patent 4 596 764 show that, in the 
presence of a compound (I), the best sensitometric results 
are obtained when the protective layer consists of a pure 
bromide emulsion or a pure chloride emulsion with very fine 
halide grains, of the order of 0.07 µm, with however a 
slight increase in fogging. In all the examples, the 
photographic products contain at least 5 % molar of silver 
iodide in each light-sensitive layer. After exposure, 
these products are brought into contact with a compound of 
formula (I) by means of a separate bath used before the 
bleaching and fixing baths. US Patent 4 640 890 describes a color photographic 
product comprising a base, at least one red-sensitive 
layer, one green-sensitive layer and one blue-sensitive 
layer, with, in at least one of these sensitive layers, a 
monodisperse emulsion. The photographic product comprises 
moreover an additional layer consisting of

<CLAIMS>
A method for controlling, during photographic 
processing, the sensitivity of a color photographic 

product comprising a base, at least one light-sensitive 
silver halide emulsion layer and a top layer of non 

light-sensitive silver halide emulsion, wherein the 
exposed product is subjected to a bleaching or to a 

bleach-fixing stage, characterised in that (A) the top 
layer of the photographic product consists of an 

emulsion comprising silver halide grains having a size 
of less than 0.5 µm and a bromide content of between 30 

and 70% molar, and (B) the processing is carried out in 
the presence of a compound (1) initially present into 

the bleach or bleach-fixing bath as bleaching 
accelerating compound ; the compound (1) being defined 

by the formula: 

 
or its tautomeric form, 

in which X represents a heteroatom such as sulphur, 
oxygen or nitrogen, A represents the complementary atoms 

required to form an unsaturated ring which may contain 
one or more heteroatoms and M represents a hydrogen 

atom, an alkali metal or an ammonium group. 
A method according to Claim 1, wherein the bleaching 
accelerating compound is chosen from amongst azol, 

diazol, triazol and tetrazol derivatives substituted 
with a thiol radical. 
A method according to Claim 2, wherein the bleaching 
accelerating compound is 1,2,4-triazol-3-thiol. 
A method according to Claim 1, wherein the silver 
halide grains in the top layer have a mean size of 

between 0.1 and 0.3 µm.  
 
A method according to Claim 4, wherein the silver 
halide in the top layer is silver bromochloride. 
A method according to Claim 5, wherein the bromide 
content is between 40 and 60% molar. 
A method according to Claim 5, in which the bromide 
content is between 45 and 55% molar. 
A method according to Claim 5, wherein the bromide 
content is 50% molar. 
A method according to Claim 4, wherein the coverage 
of the top layer is between 0.05 and 0.5 mg/dm
2
. 
A method according to any one of the preceding 
claims, wherein the color photographic product comprises 

at least one photographic emulsion consisting of silver 
halide grains having a core/shell structure. 
A method according to any one of the preceding 
claims, wherein the color photographic product comprises 

at least one silver bromoiodide photographic emulsion. 
A method according to any one of the preceding 
claims, wherein the color photographic product comprises 

at least one monodisperse photographic emulsion. 
A method according to any one of the preceding 
claims, wherein at least one of the light-sensitive 

layers consists of a mixture of photographic emulsions 
with different speed. 
A method according to one of Claims 1 to 13, 
wherein the color photographic products is a reversal 

product.

halide emulsion layer and one non-light sensitive silver 
halide emulsion top layer comprising silver halide 

grains whose mean size is less than 0.5 µm and whose
