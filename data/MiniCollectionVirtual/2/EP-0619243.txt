<ABSTRACT>
This anti-theft device is intended for containers such as bottles.   A magnetically and/or electromagnetically detectable means (4) is integrated into the capping or overcapping means (3) of the container (1). The detectable means (4) may be an electronic microcircuit, a printed circuit or an emitter filament, inserted between the cap (5) and the seal (6) of a stopper (3), and applied or fixed either to the bottom (7) of the cap or to the upper face of the seal (6). This means (4) is detected when a defrauder passes beneath a door or between detector panels.

<CLAIMS>
Anti-theft device for containers provided with a capping or overcapping means, 
characterised in that it comprises, for each container (1), an electrically and/or 

magnetically and/or electromagnetically detectable means (4; 9; 10), integrated in the 
capping or overcapping means (3) of this container (1). 
Anti-theft device for containers according to Claim 1, characterised in that the 
detectable means integrated in the capping or overcapping means (3) is an electronic 

microcircuit or "chip" (9). 
Anti-theft device for containers according to Claim 1, characterised in that the 
detectable means integrated in the capping or overcapping means (3) is a printed 

electric circuit. 
Anti-theft device for containers according to Claim 1, characterised in that the 
detectable means integrated in the capping or overcapping means (3) is a "label" with 

a magnetic code (4). 
Anti-theft device for containers according to Claim 1, characterised in that the 
detectable means integrated in the capping or overcapping means (3) is an emitting 

filament (10). 
Anti-theft device for containers according to Claim 1, characterised in that the 
detectable means integrated in the capping or overcapping means (3) is formed from 

paint, ink or varnish deposited or sprayed on a part of the capping or overcapping 
means (3). 
Anti-theft device for containers with a cap (3) consisting of a closure (5) covering a 
seal (6) in the form of a disc, according to any one of Claims 1 to 6, characterised in 

that the detectable means (4; 9; 10) is inserted between the base (7) of the closure (5)  
 

and the top face of the joint (6). 
Anti-theft device for containers according to Claim 7, characterised in that the 
detectable means (4; 9; 10) is applied or fixed to the base (7) of the closure (5). 
Anti-theft device for containers according to Claim 7, characterised in that the 
detectable means (4; 9; 10) is applied or fixed to the top face of the seal (6). 
Anti-theft device for containers according to Claim 6, characterised in that, in the 
case of a detectable means formed by the deposition or spraying of an invisible ink or 

varnish, this detectable means is deposited or sprayed onto the outer face of the cap 
(3) or of the closure (5). 
Anti-theft device for containers according to any one of Claims 1 to 10, 
characterised in that the detectable means (4; 9; 10) integrated in the capping or 

overcapping means (3), is also used as a means of identifying the product contained 
in the container (1).
