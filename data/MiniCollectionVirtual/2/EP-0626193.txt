<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a positively charged
microporous filter medium suitable for use in treating a
variety of compositions, particularly pharmaceutical and
biological solutions. The present inventive filter medium
allows for the filtration of compositions to remove
undesirable contaminants such as bacteria, while allowing
desirable positively charged species such as preservatives,
bacteriostats, and the like to pass through the filter with
the filtrate.Microporous membranes are well-known in the art. Such
membranes have been used to ultrapurify water for use in
making semiconductors, to filter paint compositions, to
purify pharmaceuticals, and to perform a number of other
widely divergent functions. Microporous membranes can have
pore sizes ranging from about 0.01 to over 10 Âµm; thus,
they are suitable for removing particles of a variety of
sizes.Filters are typically used to remove suspended
contaminants from fluids to provide for the passage of the
clarified fluid (filtrate). A filter can achieve fluid
clarification by different mechanisms. Suspended
contaminants can be removed through mechanical sieving
wherein particles larger than the pore rating of the filter
medium are removed from the fluid. With this mechanism,
filtration efficiency is essentially controlled by the size
of the contaminant relative to the pore diameter of the
filter medium.Another mechanism by which a filter can achieve fluid
clarification is through adsorption of suspended
contaminants onto the filter surface. Removal of
contaminants by this mechanism is controlled by the surface
characteristics of the suspended contaminants and by the 
filter medium itself. Conventional filter media, however,
adsorb many different particles without discretion. This
often is undesirable in that many filtering applications
require certain compounds to remain in the filtrate instead
of adsorbing onto the surface of the filter medium. For
example, in the filtering of pharmaceutical and biological
compositions to remove contaminants, it is typically
undesirable to remove preservatives, bacteriostats, and the
like from the composition.In the filtering of compositions, many different
materials have been used to prepare filter media. Of
particular usefulness have been polymers such as
polyamides, polyesters, polyolefins, and the like. Many of
the polymers which provide desirable structural
characteristics, such as polyolefins, however, are
hydrophobic and are not well-suited for filtering aqueous
media at low fluid pressures. In order to
