<ABSTRACT>
In order to determine magnetic inhomogeneities in a sample of magnetisable material, a magnetic field is induced in the sample and the stray magnetic flux (leakage flux), resulting from the magnetic field in the sample, is determined near the surface of the sample using sensors. The determined values are converted into electrical voltage signals, the magnetic field-induction and sensor unit (18) being moved along a predetermined path over the sample. The electrical voltage signals corresponding to the stray magnetic flux are subjected to evaluation and the results of the evaluation are output. In this case, the electric voltage signals delivered by the sensors are amplified in a programmable amplifier stage, the output signals of the amplifier stage are subjected in a signal evaluation stage to a frequency-dependent evaluation and the output signals of the signal evaluation stage are processed in time-dependent fashion in a peak-value formation and holding stage. For this purpose, the device contains a signal processor (22) which has a programmable amplifier module (60), a signal evaluation module (70) and a peak-value formation and holding module (80).
