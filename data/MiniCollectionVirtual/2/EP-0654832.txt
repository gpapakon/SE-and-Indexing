<ABSTRACT>
A method for producing a GaP epitaxial wafer used for 
fabrication of light emitting diodes having higher 

brightness than light emitting diodes fabricated from a 
GaP epitaxial wafer produced by a conventional method. 

The method comprises the steps of: preparing a GaP 
layered substrate (15) with one or more GaP layers on a 

GaP single crystal substrate (10) in the first series of 
liquid phase epitaxial growth; obtaining a layered GaP 

substrate (15a) by eliminating surface irregularities of 
said GaP layered substrate (15) by mechano-chemical 

polishing to make the surface to be planar; and then 
forming a GaP light emitting layer composite (19) on 

said layered GaP substrate (15a) in the second series of 
liquid phase e
pitaxial growth.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method for producing 
electroluminescent materials used for fabicating GaP light 
emitting devices, which materials have a structure of a 
plurality of GaP layers epitaxially grown on a GaP single 
crystal substrate ( hereafter referred to as GaP epitaxial 
wafer ). In general, GaP light emitting diodes are fabricated in 
such a manner that first one or more GaP crystal layers of 
both n-type and p-type are consecutively one by one 
laminated on an n-type Gap single crystal substrate to 
produce a GaP epitaxial wafer including a pn junction and 
then said GaP epitaxial wafer is processed into the devices. 
In the mean time, GaP light emitting diodes are largely 
divided into three kinds in regard to the colors of emitted 
light, such as a green Gap light emitting diode ( or  
 
yellowish green GaP light emitting diode ), a red GaP light 
emitting diode and a pure green GaP light emitting diode. A green GaP light emitting diode 2 is fabricated from a 
GaP epitaxial wafer as shown in Fig. 2, in which Nitrogen 
atoms( N ) serving as luminescence centers are doped in the 
portion of the n-type GaP layer in the vicinity of the pn 
junction and emits yellowish green light with the peak 
wavelength of about 567 nm. A red GaP light emitting diode 4 is fabricated from a 
GaP epitaxial wafer as shown in Fig. 3, in which Zinc ( Zn ) 
and Oxygen ( O ) are both doped in the p type layer to form 
Zn-O pairs serving as luminescence centers and emits red 
light light with the peak wavelength of about 700 nm. A pure green GaP light emitting diode 6 is fabricated 
from a GaP epitaxial wafer as shown in Fig. 4, which has no 
dopant as luminescence centers therein and emits pure green 
light with the peak wavelength of about 555 nm. The GaP epitaxial wafer 2 used for fabricating green 
light emitting diodes, the GaP epitaxial wafer 4 used for 
fabricating red light emitting diodes and the GaP epitaxial 
wafer 6 used for fabricating pure green light emitting  
 
diodes are illustrated in sectional structure respectively 
in Figs. 2, 3 and 4, as an example for each. The Gap 
epitaxial wafer 2 for green light diodes has a structure in 
which an n-type GaP buffer layer 11a, an n-type GaP layer 
12a, a Nitrogen doped n-type GaP layer 13a and a p-type GaP 
layer 14a are consecutively in that order formed on an n-type 
GaP single crystal substrate 10a; the GaP epitaxial 
wafer 4 for red light emitting diodes has a structure in 
which an n-type GaP layer 11b and a p-type GaP layer 14b 
including
