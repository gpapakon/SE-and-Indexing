<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an ink, a
recording method employing the ink, and an apparatus
charged with the ink. In particular, the present
invention relates to an ink which exhibits less
blurring of images recorded on a recording medium which
has an ink-receiving surface layer composed of a binder
and a pigment, a recording method employing the ink,
and an apparatus charged with the ink.Conventionally, for ink-jet recording, an
aqueous ink is used which comprises a water-soluble dye
and an aqueous medium for solving the dye. The ink for
ink-jet recording needs to meet the requirements below:
(1) The ink gives an image of sufficient density.(2) The ink dries quickly on a recording medium.(3) Feathering on a recorded image appears little.(4) The recorded image does not flow out when the
image is brought into contact with water or alcohol, or
is decipherable enough even if some flow-out of the ink
occurs (water-fastness).(5) The ink or the recorded image has sufficient
light-fastness. (6) The ink does not clog at a penpoint or an ink
nozzle.(7) The ink is stably ejected during continuous
recording or after interruption of recording for a long
time without causing defects such as blurring of a
recorded image (ejection stability).(8) The ink is stable in storage.(9) The ink does not damage members brought into
contact with the ink.(10) The ink is safe for persons handling the ink, the
safety including negativeness in Ames test.
In ink-jet recording utilizing thermal energy,
the ink needs further to meet an additional requirement
below:(11) The ink has a sufficient thermal stability, and
does not adversely affect a thermal energy-generating
means.Black inks which meet the above requirements on
plain paper are disclosed in Japanese Patent
Application Laid-Open Nos. 1-135880 and 1-193375. A
color ink for full-color image formation is disclosed
in Japanese Patent Application Laid-Open No. 62-199667.
The inks of prior art, however, do not necessarily
satisfy all the requirements enumerated above.In particular, in full-color image formation, a
problem remains unsolved that a formed image blurs
after leaving it for a long term. For full-color image 
recording, in order to obtain sharp images, recording
mediums (coated paper) are usually used which have an
ink-receiving surface layer comprising a pigment and a
binder. The coated paper causes significantly the
above-mentioned blurring.Of four colors including black, cyan, magenta,
and yellow, the magenta color is especially liable to
cause blurring, and in an
