<ABSTRACT>
Apparatus for detecting the presence of volatile amines in a sample is disclosed. The apparatus has a receptacle (6, 40) containing a test composition. A swab (10, 16, 58) brings a sample into contact with the test composition and an indicator substance (30, 44) is arranged to detect vapour arising as a result of reaction of the sample with the test composition and to change colour if said vapour contains volatile amines. The apparatus can be used in the diagnosis of bacterial vaginosis.

<DESCRIPTION>
 Title of the InventionAPPARATUS FOR THE DETECTION OF VOLATILE AMINESField of the InventionThe present invention relates to a diagnostic apparatus and method suitable for the detection of volatile amines.Background to the InventionResearch which has been carried out in recent years indicates that a condition known as bacterial vaginosis (BV) is associated with volatile amines, particularly trimethyl amines which, when released, give a strong fishy odour. One test which is currently available to identify these volatile amines is to put some vaginal fluid on a slide with normal saline solution and then add potassium hydroxide. The hydroxide drives off the volatile amine and a strong fishy odour is released. A diagnostic device for carrying out a simple test of a similar nature is described in GB 2199944. This device comprises a test tube containing an alkaline medium and a swab. The swab is placed in contact with vaginal fluid and then inserted into the alkaline medium in the test tube. The presence of volatile amines is detected by smell through a window or opening in the side of the test tube. While this device has resulted in major improvements in the ease of diagnosis of BV, there is a major disadvantage of the technique in that the detection of the volatile amines is subjective, difficult to standardise and unpleasant.The present invention seeks to provide a diagnostic device and method which does not suffer from these disadvantages.Summary of the InventionAccording to the present invention there is provided an apparatus for detecting the presence of volatile amines in a 

sample, the apparatus comprising a receptacle containing a test composition, means for retaining the sample in contact with the test composition and indicator means arranged to detect vapour arising as a result of reaction of the sample with the test composition and adapted to change colour if said vapour contains volatile amines, the test composition comprising a substance for driving out of solution any volatile amines present in the sample.In the. preferred embodiment, the test composition also comprises a second substance for trapping any ammonia from the sample to avoid the ammonia making contact with the indicator means.Thus, the present invention provides an apparatus for detecting the presence of volatile amines, important in diagnosing BV, without the requirement to carry out the rather unpleasant "sniff test" required with the prior art device. The conversion of the detection of volatile amines from a test by smell to a

CLAIMS :
1. Apparatus for detecting the presence of volatile amines in a sample, the apparatus comprising a receptacle containing a test composition, means for retaining the sample in contact with the test composition and indicator means arranged to detect vapour arising as a result of reaction of the sample with the test composition and adapted to change colour if said vapour contains volatile amines, the test composition comprising a substance for driving out of solution any volatile amines present in the sample.
2. Apparatus according to claim 1 wherein the test composition also comprises a second substance for trapping any ammonia from the sample to avoid the ammonia making contact with the indicator means.
3. Apparatus according to claim 2 wherein the test composition- comprises an alkaline solution of dipotassium tetraiodomercurate.
4. Apparatus according to claim 3 wherein the test composition is an alkaline solution of dipotassium tetraiodomercurate at a concentration of 65 grams per litre of solution.
5. Apparatus according to any preceding claim wherein the indicator means comprises a pH indicator substance, for example nitrazine yellow.
6. A diagnostic device for detecting the presence of volatile amines in a sample, the device comprising a first part defining a receptacle containing a test composition comprising a substance for driving out of solution any volatile amines present in the sample; means for supporting a swab carrying a sample so that the sample is in contact with the test composition; and 


 a second part capable of engagement with the first part and carrying indicator means arranged to detect vapour arising as a result of reaction of the sample with the test composition and adapted to change colour if said vapour contains volatile amines, the device being such that engagement of the second part with the first part closes off the receptacle and causes a swab to come into contact with the test composition, the indicator means being visible in use of the device.
7. A diagnostic device according to claim 6 wherein the first part comprises a base having an upstanding wall defining said receptacle and a guide constituting the swab supporting means and the second part has a ledge for engaging said upstanding wall, an upper surface carrying the indicator means and a lower surface for applying pressure to the swab to bring it into contact with the test composition in the receptacle, there being at least one passageway for enabling said vapour emitted during a test to pass from the lower surface to the upper surface and thereby to contact the indicator means.
8. A diagnostic device according to claim 7 wherein the second part comprises an indicator cap assembly having a cap body defining the ledge, and indicator pad constituting the indicator means and being arranged between the upper surface of the cap assembly and a mesh.
9. A diagnostic device according to claim 8 comprising a gas permeable membrane between the upper surface of the cap assembly and the indictor pad.
10. A diagnostic device according to claim 6 wherein the means for supporting a swab comprises a piston member defining a passageway for locating a swab handle and being movable relative to the swab handle within the receptacle. 


11. A diagnostic device according to claims 6 and 10 wherein the second part defines a chamber housing indicator fluid constituting said indicator means, said chamber having an inlet capable of communication with gas in the receptacle via a passageway associated with the piston member.
12. A diagnostic device according to claim 11 wherein the inlet of the indicator fluid chamber is sealed by a penetrable membrane and wherein the piston body carries means for penetrating said membrane in use of the device.
13. A diagnostic device comprising a body part containing a test composition in a manner such that the test composition can be caused to move relative to the body part by the insertion of a swab carrying a sample, the test composition including a substance for driving out of solution any-.volatile amines present in the sample; and an indicator part containing indicator means arranged to detect vapour arising as a result of reaction of the sample with the test composition and adapted to change colour if said vapour contains volatile amines, the indicator means being arranged such that when the test composition has been moved by the swab carrying the sample relative to the body part, vapour released therefrom is brought into contact with the indicator means.
14. A diagnostic device according to claim 13 wherein the swab is supported by a swab stick which carries a seal defining behind the swab and with the body part a reaction chamber.
15. A diagnostic device according to any of claims 6 to 14 wherein the test composition also comprises a substance to absorb ammonia. 


16. A method of carrying out a test for detecting the presence of volatile amines, the method comprising: taking a sample of body fluid from a patient; placing the sample in contact with a test composition comprising a first substance to drive volatile amines out of solution and a second substance to absorb ammonia; and detecting the colour change of an indicator means placed in contact with vapour driven off from the sample by the first substance.
17. A method of diagnosing baterial vaginosis by carrying out the steps of the method according to claim 16.
