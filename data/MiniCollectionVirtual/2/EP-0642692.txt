<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a novel information recording medium and the
recording of information thereon. More particularly, the invention relates to an
optical recording medium, preferably in the form of a disk, or in tape format,
suitable for use with an optical recording and playback apparatus, the recording
medium being stable yet readily and accurately erasable.It has long been apparent that optical recording, and in particular, optical
disk recording, is a very promising recording method as it allows instantaneous
playback, very fast random access and much higher recording density than is
possible with magnetic recording and archival storage. It is widely recognized that
the optical disc system with the greatest potential is the type that uses a highly
focused laser beam as an ultra-fine recording stylus to store encoded information
at very high data rates with extremely high density.Optical recording methods have been proposed in which light from a laser
is focused upon the surface of a recording medium with sufficient intensity to cause
a detectable change in the physical characteristics of the surface material. Among
these methods is the establishment of an information pattern of pits or bumps. In
such methods, the representative information pattern of pits can be formed in the
surface of the recording medium by suitably controlling the intensity of the focused
light in accordance with the information to be recorded while relative motion is
established between the recording medium and the focused light spot.The recording process must have a sufficiently high resolution to allow the
recording of bumps or pits of very small size to satisfy the requirement of high
density, and the sensitivity of the process must be high enough to permit the use
of economical, low power recording lasers, but should be low enough so that the
recording medium can withstand a playback exposure high enough to yield a high
signal-to-noise ratio. Furthermore, it is clear that in order to avoid long term 
degradation due to ambient conditions and to ensure totally non-destructive readout,
the process must have a well-defined exposure threshold below which there is no
response. In addition, it is desirable that the recording process permit instant
playback without the need for post-recording processing before readout. None of
the presently known processes meet all these requirements.In the past, there have been increasing efforts to develop an information
recording method in which information is written in a thin film of
