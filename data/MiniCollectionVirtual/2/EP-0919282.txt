<ABSTRACT>
The insert (1) is designed with a rinsing-water tubular system (2) dockable at the rinsing-water supply system of the automatic washer in the rinsing container. Sieve baskets, holders and similar receptions for utensils to be washed are included. The insert has a carrying frame (4) designed with the rinsing water system as a basic module and several rinsing apparatus modules each for determined utensils to be rinsed. These modules are combinable with the basic module, individually separately supplied from the rinsing water tubular system. The rinsing apparatus modules are designed as push-in units with the same basic measurements, and in the basic module lie above each other in same type receptions (12-15) in frame planes (E1,E2). Also rinsing water connections (12a-15a;12b-15b) are provided, allocated for the rinsing apparatus modules.
