<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a construction for milking 
animals, such as cows, comprising a milking robot (6) with 

teat cups (8). In the construction, at least two teat cups 
(8) are interconnected by means of a hinge and are jointly 

attached to the robot (6). The link between the robot arm (7) 
and the two teat cups (8) comprises two arms which are 

pivotally interconnected. The pivotal arm construction (15) 
further includes electric motors (30; 33; 37; 41), with the 

aid of which the position of the teat cups (8) can be altered 
in a horizontal plane.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a construction for milking
animals, such as cows, according to the preamble of claim 1.A construction of this type is described in
EP-A-0 565 189. In this construction the pair of teat cups is
pivotal as a whole in a horizontal plane relative to the
robot arm; in addition the two teat cups are simultaneously
movable in a lateral direction with respect to the
longitudinal direction of an animal. Such a construction is
disadvantageous because the movement of the teat cups is
restricted and the teat cups cannot move independently. EP-A-0
207 572 describes teat cups which are individually pivotal
by means of hinges driven by electromotors. NL 8502082
relates to teat cups which are individually attached to the
robot arm via pivotally interconnected arms. NL 8500091
describes teat cups which are individually and pivotally
attached to a central pivot point. Finally, NL 8500694
relates to teat cups which are individually pivotal and
driven by a cylinder. Although, these constructions allow
individual movement of the teat cups, these constructions are
complicated, inefficient and expensive.The invention has for its object to provide a
construction of the above-mentioned type, in which the teat
cups can be easily adjusted in various positions
independently of each other and which consists in a simple
construction.According to the invention, this is achieved in
that two teat cups are interconnected by means of a hinge,
one of the two teat cups being pivotally attached to a robot
arm by means of two pivotally interconnected arms. Thus, a
flexible robot arm is obtained, in which the teat cups can be
adjusted to various positions relative to each other. In
accordance with a still further feature of the invention, the 
pivotal arm, which is not directly connected to the robot
arm, extends in a horizontal plane. As a result thereof, the
teat cup arranged nearest to the robot arm can be pivoted to
a position relatively close to the robot arm, without it
being obstructed by the pivotal arm.In order to achieve that the teat cups can be
accurately positioned to the teats, one pair of teat cups is
connected, in accordance with the invention, to the robot arm
via one pivotal arm construction, a pivotal arm construction
being further provided with electric motors, with the aid of
which the position of the relevant teat cups can be altered
in a mainly horizontal plane.In accordance with a still further feature of the
invention, the milking robot includes detection means, such
as a laser, with the aid
