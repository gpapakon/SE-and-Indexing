<ABSTRACT>
A method, using a public-key cryptosystem, for enabling a predetermined entity (18) to monitor communications of users suspected of unlawful activities while protecting the privacy of law-abiding users, wherein each user is assigned a pair of matching secret and public keys. According to the method, each user's secret key is broken into shares. Then, each user provides a plurality of "trustees" (22a) pieces of information. The pieces of information provided to each trustee (22a) enable that trustee (22a) to verify that such information includes a "share" of a secret key of some given public key. Each trustee (22a) can verify that the pieces of information provided include a share of the secret key without interaction with any other trustee (22a) or by sending messages to the user. Upon a predetermined request or condition, e.g., a court order (20) authorizing the entity (18) to monitor the communications of a user suspected of unlawful activity, the trustees (22a) reveal to the entity (18) the shares of the secret key of such user. This enables the entity (18) to reconstruct the secret key and monitor the suspect user's communications.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates generally to
cryptosystems and more particularly to methods for
enabling a given entity to monitor communications of
users
via a communications system.In a single-key cryptosystem a common secret
key is used both to encrypt and decrypt messages.
Thus only two parties who have safely exchanged such
a key beforehand can use these systems for private
communication. This severely limits the
applicability of single-key systems.In a double-key cryptosystem, the process of
encrypting and decrypting is instead governed by
different keys. In essence, one comes up with a
pair of matching encryption and decryption keys.
What is encrypted using a given encryption key can
only be decrypted using the corresponding decryption
key. Moreover, the encryption key does not "betray"
its matching decryption key. That is, knowledge of
the encryption key does not help to find out the
value of the decryption key. The advantage of
double-key systems is that they can allow two
parties who have never safely exchanged any key to
privately communicate over an insecure communication
line (i.e., one that may be tapped by an
adversary). They do this by executing an on-line,
private communication protocol.In particular, Party A alerts Party B that he
wants to talk to him privately. Party B then
computes a pair of matching encryption and
decryption keys (EB, DB). B then sends A key EB.
Party A now encrypts his message m, obtaining the
ciphertext c = EB(m), and sends c to B over the
insecure channel. B decrypts the ciphertext by
computing m = DB(c). If an adversary eavesdrops all 
communication between A and B, he will then hear
both B's encryption key, EB, and A's ciphertext, c.
However, since the adversary does not know B's
decryption key, DB, he cannot compute m from c.The utility of the above protocol is still
quite limited since it suffers from two drawbacks.
First, for A to send a private message to B it is
necessary also that B send a message to A, at least
the first time. In some situations this is a real
disadvantage. Moreover, A has no guarantee (since
the line is insecure anyway) that the received
string DB really is B's encryption key. Indeed, it
may be a key sent by an adversary, who will then
understand the subsequent, encrypted transmission.An ordinary public-key cryptosystem ("PKC")
solves both difficulties and greatly facilitates
communication. Such a system essentially consists
of using a double-key system in conjunction with a
proper key management center. Each user X comes up
with a pair

A method, using a public-key cryptosystem, for enabling a
predetermined entity to monitor communications of users via a

communications system, wherein each user is assigned a pair
of matching secret and public keys, comprising the steps of:


breaking each user's secret decryption key into shares;
providing trustee computing devices pieces of information enabling
the trustee computing devices to verify that the pieces

of information include shares of a secret key of some given
public key before reconstructing the secret key; and
upon a predetermined request, having the trustee computing
devices reveal the shares of the secret key of a user to enable

the entity to attempt reconstruction of the secret key
for monitoring communications to said user.

said user is known to the trustee computing devices.

of trustee computing devices are unable to reconstruct the

secret key.

computing device can verify that the pieces of information

provided include a share of the secret key without interaction
