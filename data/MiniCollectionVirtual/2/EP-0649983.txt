<ABSTRACT>
The valve includes a tubular casing (2), an electromagnet 
(3) defined by a tubular former (4) and an electrical 

winding (5), a tubular body (6), a portion (7) of which 
constitutes the core of the magnetic circuit defined in 

the valve, a movable valve shutter member (8) controlling 
the flow of fuel through an injection orifice (11) and a 

tubular armature (12) attracted by the portion (7) of the 
body (6) when the electromagnet (3) is excited and 

thereby determining the stroke of the valve shutter 
member (8). The main characteristic of the valve lies in 

the fact that it includes an axial interlock between the 
casing (2) and the former (4), this interlock having at 

least of a tongue (36) formed in the casing (2) and 
engaging a groove (25) in the former (4)

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an electromagnetically
actuated fuel metering and atomising valve, intended to
be fitted to the fuel supply device of an internal
combustion engine.According to what is described in European Patent Application NÂ° 0536774, actually the
valves of the above type include a main body internally housing an annular electromagnet, a
core and a movable valve shutter element. The electromagnet consists of a support former
and an electrical winding.A main disadvantage lies in the fact that the former and
the main body are not directly fixed to each other, but
are fixed indirectly by connection between the various
fixed components of the valve. It is clear that
clearances may exist between the former and the main
body, which clearances could increase over time making
the position of the electrical winding unstable relative
to the axial air gap of the magnetic circuit defined in
the valve. It is clear that this instability affects the
axial component of the magnetic force controlling the
stroke of the valve shutter element, meaning that for
each similar command to the electromagnet the time taken
for the valve shutter member to complete its stroke could
be different. In addition, this clearance could
compromise the fluid-tight seal of the valve as the seals 
would age prematurely as a result of the extra stress
(vibration of the various elements) to which they were
subjected.The object of the present invention is to provide an
electromagnetically operated fuel metering and atomising
valve free from the above disadvantages, that is to say
one provided with a system which prevents clearances from
forming and at the same time provides a reliable fluid-tight
seal.Further objects and advantages of the present invention
will become apparent from the description which follows.An electromagnetically actuated fuel metering and atomising valve, intended to be fitted in a
fuel supply system of an internal combustion engine, comprising:
a tubular casing housing the lower portion of the said valve;an electromagnet defined by a tubular former and an electrical winding mounted in an
annular seat formed inside the said former; a tubular body with a lower portion made of ferromagnetic material forming the core of a
magnetic circuit defined in the said valve; a movable valve shutter member operable to control the flow of fuel through an injection
orifice; a movable tubular armature attracted by the said lower portion of the said body when the
electromagnet is excited and supporting the said valve

<CLAIMS>
An electromagnetically actuated fuel metering and
atomising valve, intended to be fitted in a fuel supply

system of an internal combustion engine, comprising:

a tubular casing (2) housing the lower
portion of the said valve;
an electromagnet (3) defined by a tubular former (4)
and an electrical winding (5) mounted in an annular seat

formed inside the said former (4);
a tubular body (6) with a lower portion (7) made of
ferromagnetic material forming the core of a magnetic

circuit defined in the said valve;
a movable valve shutter member (8) operable to
control the flow of fuel through an injection orifice

(11);
a movable tubular armature (12) attracted by the
said lower portion (7) of the said body (6) when the

electromagnet (3) is excited and supporting the said
valve shutter member (8);
a plate (13) with the said injection orifice (11)
formed therein; and
a fuel inlet (14) defined in the said body (6);

characterised in that it includes an axial interlock
between the said casing (2) and the said former (4), this

interlock involving at least one tongue (36) formed in
the said casing (2) and engaging a groove (25) formed in

the said former (4). 
A valve according to Claim 1, characterised in that
engagement of the said tongue (36) in the said groove

(25) is defined by a deformation of the tongue (36).
A valve according to Claim 2, characterised in that
the said casing (2) includes:


a lower portion (28) housing the said plate (13);
a central portion (31) having a smaller inner
diameter than that of the said lower portion (28) within

which the said armature (12) and the said valve shutter
member (8) are slidable; and
an upper portion (32) having a greater inner
diameter than that of the said central portion (31) so as

to define an annular wall (33) between these two; the
former (4) being housed within the said upper portion

(32).
A valve according to Claim 3, characterised in that
an annular seat is defined between an annular base wall

of the said former and the annular wall (33) of the said
casing (2), housing an annular seal (29) which is axially

compressed by the said former (4).
A valve according to Claim 4, characterised in that
two small part-annular grooves (25) are formed in the

said former (4) in diametrically opposite positions, and
in that two diametrically opposite notches (34) are

formed in the said upper portion (32) of the said casing 
(2), with their longitudinal axes parallel to a

longitudinal axis (X) of the said casing (2), and in that
in the bottom of each notch (34) a slot is formed through

the said upper portion (32) which defines the said tongue
(36) with the bottom of a respective notch (34).
