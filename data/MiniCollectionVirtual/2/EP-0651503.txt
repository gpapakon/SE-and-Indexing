<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to an integrated input/output 
interface for low and/or high voltage signals of the 

digital and/or analog type. It comprises essentially a 
power amplification circuit block (2) having at least one 

low voltage input (A) and at least one high voltage output 
(B), and a second amplification circuit block (3) including 

active power components and having a high voltage input 
connected to said high voltage output (B) and at least one 

low voltage output (D). A conventional circuit block (4) 
prevents a high voltage signal being input to (B) from 

propagating through the block (2), so that it only affects 
the block (3). 
This interface is implemented in mixed high voltage BCD 
technology.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to an interface input/output
integrated circuit for low and/or high voltage signals of
the digital and/or analog type.As is well known, it is often necessary to interface
devices which operate with widely different voltages.A typical example of that requirement is to be found in the
field of industrial control systems where an intelligent
unit, typically a microcontroller, is employed to process
input information and output electric signals for driving a
variety of actuators.The input information may either be very small analog
voltages from sensors arranged to monitor a process to be
controlled or digital signals.The microcontroller is normally operated at a much lower
voltage than the operating voltage of an actuator, and
accordingly, the microcontroller output would be uncapable
to drive the actuator directly.Thus, a need exists for appropriate interfaces effective to
provide electric and functional links between such devices.The interface circuits proposed heretofore, as employed in
similar or comparable situations to that just outlined,
exhibit a low degree of applicational flexibility. In fact,
they can admit of but a narrow range of variability in the
amplitude of the signals (voltages or currents) which may
be input thereto.Also, just as limited is the range of variability of the
signals to be obtained at the output.In other words, prior art interfaces can only be input low 
voltage (hence, low power) signals to output high voltage
signals, or be input high voltage (high power) signals to
output low voltage signals; and this within a fairly narrow
range of variability of the values involved.The technical problem of this invention is to provide an
input/output interface, of a type integrated to a
semiconductor, which can operate on both low and high
voltage input signals to correspondingly output high or low
voltage signals.Another object of the invention is to provide an interface
which can drive loads requiring working voltages or power
levels which may vary within a very broad range, and can
also handle analog signals of small amplitude as well as
digital signals that may have high voltages.The technical problem is solved by an input/output
interface as indicated above and defined in the
characterizing parts of the claims appended hereto.The features and advantages of an interface circuit
according to the invention will be apparent from the
following description of an embodiment thereof, given by
way of example and not of limitation with reference to the
accompanying
