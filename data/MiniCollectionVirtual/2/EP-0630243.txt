<ABSTRACT>
A method for relieving craving in a nicotine-habituated patient and a composition for treating the patient is provided. The composition administered has a non-specific acethylcholine agonist and a muscarinic antagonist. A particularly preferred composition for relieving craving takes the form of a tablet where the first component is a water soluble physostigmine and the second component is a water soluble scopolamine. Patients treated have reported a slight increase in alertness and a diminished craving for nicotine.

<DESCRIPTION>
TREATING NICOTINE CRAVING IN SMOKING CESSATIONField of the InventionThe present invention generally relates to treating smoking withdrawal symptoms, and more particularly. to a composition useful in relieving craving in a nicotine- habituated patient abstaining from or reducing nicotine intake.This invention was made with government support under The Veterans Administration and Grant No. H-22149, awarded by the National Institutes of Health. .The government has certain rights in this invention.Background of the InventionThe statistical risk of dying from lung cancer in the United States has doubled in the past thirty years for male cigarette smokers and has quadrupled for female cigarette smokers. Lung cancer has now displaced cardiovascular disease as the single most important cause of excess mortality among smokers. Yet, about 50 million Americans continue to smoke.The benefits for smoking cessation are many, and are summarized in a publication entitled "The Health Benefits of Smoking Cessation: A Report of the Surgeon General, 1990", available from the Office on Smoking and Health, Center for Disease Control, Rockville, Maryland. Among the benefits summarized are that within twenty-four hours the chance of a heart attack decreases, within about two weeks to three months lung function increases up to thirty percent, and in one year the excess risk of coronary heart disease becomes half that of a smoker.Glassman et al. in an article entitled, "Cigarette Craving, Smoking Withdrawal, and Clonidine, " Science, 226, pp. 864-866 (November 1984), describes the craving developed for the tension-reducing drug, nicotine, in the absence of the drug and attributes the craving to the habituated user's experience of a rebound dysphoria. The habituated user thus seeks the drug to eliminate that dysphoria in order to treat, or relieve, craving when the 

person is attempting to abstain from or is reducing nicotine intake.Smoking cessation programs often address both the physiological (biochemical) factor and the psychological factor. Recently, "nicotine-releasing patches" have been highly advertised, and are presumably useful by maintaining a nicotine-habituated patient on nicotine while addressing the psychological factor. Methods that maintain a patient on nicotine do not provide a- long term solution to the problem. For example, there are now a number of -patients addicted to nicotine containing gum, some of whom are seeking treatment for their new or substitute addiction.Glassman et al., Science, 226, pp. 864-866

<CLAIMS>
It is Claimed :
1. A method for relieving• craving in a nicotine-habituated person abstaining from or reducing nicotine intake comprising: administering an admixture consisting essentially of first and second components to a nicotine-habituated person, said person having endogenous acetylcholine, the first component being a non-specific acetylcholine agonist, the second component being a muscarinic antagonist .
2. The method as in claim 1 wherein the first component has at least one determinable muscarinic effect and one nicotine effect by itself, the second component has at least one determinable antimuscarinic effect by itself, and the admixture has a balanced weight ratio of the first and second components sufficient substantially to eliminate the determinable muscarinic and antimuscarinic effects while the admixture is in an amount effective substantially to relieve nicotine craving in the person to whom the admixture is administered for a period of time.
3. The method as in claim 1 wherein the admixture optionally includes a pharmacologically suitable component selected from the group consisting of a solvent, a buffering agent, a preservative, an excipient, a flavoring agent, a tabletting agent, and mixtures thereof.
4. The method as in claim 1 wherein the administration is an oral dose and includes providing a water soluble amount of each component in each dose of between about 0.3 mg to about 0.9 mg.
5. The method as in claim 2 wherein the first component is selected from the group consisting of physostigmine, tacrine, methacholine, edrophonium, and water soluble derivatives thereof. 


 6. The method as in claim
'
 2 wherein the second component is selected from the group consisting of scopolamine, atropine, and water soluble derivatives thereof.
7. A composition for relieving craving in a nicotine-habituated person abstaining from or reducing nicotine intake comprising: a tablet suitable for oral administration to a nicotine-habituated person, said person having endogenous acetylcholine, said tablet having first and second components admixed therein, the first component being a non-specific acetylcholine agonist, the second component being a muscarinic antagonist, a dose of one or more tablets being effective substantially to relieve nicotine craving for a period of time in a nicotine-habituated person to whom said dose is administered.
8. . The composition as in claim 7 wherein the first component is a water soluble physostigmine.
9. The composition as in claim 7•wherein the second component is a water soluble scopolamine.
10. The composition as in claim 7 wherein the first component is physostigmine sulfate, the second component is scopolamine hydrobromide, and the first and second components are in about a 1:1 weight ratio.
11. The composition as in claim 7 wherein the tablet optionally includes a pharmacologically suitable component selected from the group consisting of a buffering agent, a preservative, an excipient, a flavoring agent, a tabletting agent, and mixtures thereof.
12. The composition as in claim 7 wherein the first component is physostigmine sulfate, the second component is a scopolamine salt, and a dose is wherein each 


of the first and second components is in an amount of between about 0.3 mg to about 0.9 mg.
13. The composition as in claim 12 wherein the first and second components are in about a 1:1 weight ratio.
