<ABSTRACT>
Disclosed are sterile surgical needles formed 
of alloys of tungsten and a second metal selected from 

the group consisting of rhenium, rhodium and iridium. 
The needles exhibit a tensile yield strength in excess 

of 250,000 psi and a tensile modulus of elasticity in 
excess of 45 x 10‚Å∂ psi, and have advantageously high 

ductility.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to surgical
needles as per the preamble of claim 1. An example of such a
needle is disclosed by US-A-4 927 420.Surgical needles have been known for some time
and such needles with sutures attached are commonly used
in various types of surgical procedures. The surgical
needles are usually made from stainless steel and have a
blunt end to which a suture is attached. The blunt end
may be drilled or have a channel placed therein and the
suture is usually swaged or crimped in the drilled hole
or channel. In order to reduce trauma in placing
sutures in tissue, the suture itself generally has a
diameter less than the diameter of the needle. Also,
the point and cutting edge of the needle should be made
as sharp as possible so as to require as little force as
possible to penetrate the tissue and place the suture
and consequently to cause the least amount of trauma to
the sutured area.Surgical needles are straight or curved, that
is, they have the shape of some part of a circle. This
may be from a quarter of a circle to five-eighths of a
circle. At one end of the needle is the point or the
extreme tip of the needle. The section from that point
to the maximum width of the needle is termed the "blade"
of the needle. In cutting needles, the blade includes
the cutting edge from the point towards the blunt end.
Behind the cutting edge is the body portion of the
needle; that is, the area of the needle to be grasped by 
an appropriate needle holder. At the blunt end of the
needle is the swage or the portion of the needle into
which the suture is inserted and affixed. In placing
the needle, the needle is grasped by a suitable needle
holder which usually is a forceps type instrument that
grasps the needle at the body portion with sufficient
force to insure that the needle will not move or turn in
the instrument when the needle is being placed by the
surgeon.Use of a needle can exert stressing forces on
the needle, since the force used to drive the needle
into and through tissue (e.g., a blood vessel, the
cornea of the eye, and the like) needs to be sufficient
to drive the needle and overcome frictional drag through
the tissue. Applying this force along the shaft of the
needle from the point at which the needle is held risks
causing the needle to flex, which is undesirable as it
causes loss of control of the needle. This means the
body portion of the needle should have a relatively high
stiffness, that is, a low tendency to flex and high
tendency retain its configuration when subjected to a
def
