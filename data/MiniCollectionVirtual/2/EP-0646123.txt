<ABSTRACT>
The invention concerns pale-coloured surfactants with an extremely low peroxide content, the surfactants being obtained by treating pastes of inorganic, non-ionic and/or amphoteric or zwitterionic surfactants with hydrogen peroxide in the presence of transition-metal compounds.

<CLAIMS>
A process for the production of light-coloured surfactants 
of reduced peroxide content, in which pastes of 

anionic, nonionic and/or amphoteric or zwitterionic surfactants 
are treated with hydrogen peroxide in the presence of 

platinum metal compounds, characterized in that palladium 
or platinum on active carbon is used as the platinum metal 

compound in quantities of 10 to 1,000 ppm, based on the 
solids content of the paste. 
A process as claimed in claim 1, characterized in that 
surfactant pastes having a solids content of 5 to 85% by 

weight are used. 
A process as claimed in claims 1 and 2, characterized 
in that surfactant pastes of anionic surfactants selected 

from the group consisting of alkyl benzenesulfonates, 
alkane sulfonates, paraffin sulfonates, olefin sulfonates, 

alkyl ether sulfonates, glycerol ether sulfonates, Î±-methyl 
ester sulfonates, sulfofatty acids, alkyl sulfates, fatty 

alcohol ether sulfates, glycerol ether sulfates, monoglyceride 
(ether) sulfates, fatty acid amide (ether) sulfates, 

hydroxy mixed ether sulfates, sulfosuccinates, sulfosuccinamates, 
sulfotriglycerides, isethionates, taurides, 

sarcosinates, ether carboxylic acids and alkyl (ether) 
phosphates are used. 
A process as claimed in claims 1 to 3, characterized 
in that surfactant pastes of nonionic surfactants selected 

from the group consisting of alkyl oligoglycosides, saccharose 
esters, sorbitan esters and polysorbates are used. 
A process as claimed in claims 1 to 4, characterized 
in that surfactant pastes of amphoteric or zwitterionic 

surfactants selected from the group consisting of alkyl 
amidobetaines, aminopropionates, imidazolinium betaines and 

sulfobetaines are used. 
A process as claimed in claims 1 to 5, characterized 
in that the surfactant pastes are treated with 0.1 to 5% by  

 
weight, based on the solids content of the paste, of 

hydrogen peroxide.
