<ABSTRACT>
The second pole layer (P2) of a thin film transducer structure is fabricated by using 
two levels of photoresist to define the pattern of the (P2) pole layer. The first 

photoresist layer (22) is deposited as a thin film and is used to focus an optical 
projection device that projects the mask pattern onto the photoresist. After etching and 

curing of the first photoresist (22), which is disposed above a portion of the first pole 
piece (P1) at the apex of the transducer, a second photoresist layer (26) is deposited 

over the first photoresist layer (22) and above the insulation (18) deposited over the 
electrical coil structure (20). The second photoresist layer (26) is relatively thick and 

serves to define the frame for printing the P2 pole piece pattern a second time. The data 
track width defined by the P2 pole piece is more uniform as a result of the improved 

definition ot the frame used for registering the P2 pattern.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to the manufacture of thin film magnetic 
heads and in particular to the process of defining the magnetic 
pole layer during fabrication of a thin film inductive head. Thin film magnetic transducers or heads are used extensively in 
data processing systems, such as disk drives, for recording and 
reading data signals which are registered on a magnetic medium, 
such as a magnetic disk. Thin film magnetic heads typically 
comprise upper and lower magnetic pole layers or pole pieces, 
designated as P1 and P2, and an electrically conductive coil 
structure disposed between the magnetic layers or pole pieces. 
The tips of the P1 and P2 pole pieces define a transducing gap 
for coaction with a magnetic disk that rotates close to the 
transducing gap of the head. The pole pieces interconnect at a 
back closure. A polished ceramic substrate having a thin 
insulation layer thereon, which is lapped and polished, supports 
the different layers which are deposited to form the magnetic 
transducer. To prevent electrical shorting, insulating layers 
are provided between the coils and the pole pieces. To fabricate the P2 pole piece layer, photolithography using 
patterned masks are employed. A mask with a desired printed 
pattern is positioned over the transducer structure. An optical 
projection apparatus with a focusing element is adjusted to 
delineate the pattern to be printed and developed on a 
photoresist which is deposited over insulation covering the 
conductive coil and P1 layer. Precise control of the thickness 
of the single coat photoresist that is spin coated over the 
insulation has been found to be difficult, particularly in the 
throat region of the thin film transducer, where the P1 and P2 
layers narrow and the pole tips form the transducing gap. If the 
insulation is relatively thick, the photoresist tends to be thin.  Since the stepper of the projection apparatus has a limited 
focusing range, it is a problem to focus and frame the thin 
photoresist area in the throat region. Thus distortion is 
produced between the photoresist and insulation patterns which 
affects control of the uniformity of the P2 pole piece width and 
thus the width of the recorded data track, which is defined by 
the width of the P2 pole tip. An object of this invention is to provide a process for 
controlling the shaping of the P2 pole piece of a thin film head. Another object of this invention is to provide a process for 
controlling data track width defined by the P2 pole piece. According to this
