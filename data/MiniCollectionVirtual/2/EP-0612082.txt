<ABSTRACT>
In the production by the single-roll technique of a thin 
amorphous strip as the matrix for the manufacture of a thin 

Co-based amorphous alloy strip or a thin Fe-based 
microcrystalline alloy strip, the conditions for the 

production are controlled to those specified by the invention. 
The production conditions thus controlled concern the 

atmosphere and the pressure to be used for ejecting a molten 
metal onto a rotating cooling member, the shape of a nozzle, 

the distance between the nozzle and the rotary cooling member, 
the material for the rotary cooling member and peripheral 

speed of the rotary cooling member, etc. The individual 
numerical values of these conditions are severally important. 

The thin strips thus obtained are in an extremely small 
thickness and in a wholesome state destitute of pinholes and 

other similar defects. In the thin Co-based amorphous alloy 
strip, the extreme decrease of thickness to below 4.8 µm 

notably enhances the soft magnetic properties such as 
permeability and core loss in the high frequency range. In 

the thin Fe-based microcrystalline alloy strip, the extreme 
decrease of thickness not more than 10 µm permits improvement 

of resistance to embrittlement in addition to the improvement 
in the soft magnetic properties.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a method for the production of
a very thin soft magnetic alloy strip suitable for use in a
noise filter, a saturable reactor, a miniature inductance
element for abating spike noise, main transformer, choke coil,
a zero-phase current transformer, a magnetic head, etc.,
namely the devices which are expected to exhibit high levels
of permeability at high frequencies, a very thin soft magnetic
alloy strip by the use of the method, and an apparatus for the
production of a soft magnetic alloy strip.In recent years, the trend of electronic equipments and
devices toward reduction in size and weight and enhancement of
performance has been urging magnetic parts serving as
important functional parts to embody highly advanced
improvements. The magnetic materials to be used in such
magnetic parts, as a natural consequence, are urged to possess
outstanding magnetic properties. Particularly, materials of
high permeability are effective in numerous magnetic parts 
such as current sensors in zero-phase current transformers and
noise filters, for example.In the case of a noise filter, for example, a switching
power source is widely used as a stabilizing power source for
electronic equipments and devices. In the switching power
source, adoption of a measure for the abatement of noise
constitutes itself an important task. The high-frequency
noise including a switching frequency as its basic frequency
and the noise of the MHz range issuing from a load such as,
for example the logic circuit of a personal computer pose a
problem.For the abatement of the conducted noise of this kind,
therefore, a common mode choke coil has found acceptance for
use as a noise filter. When this filter is inserted in a
power source line, the magnitude of the noise output voltage
relative to the noise input voltage has such bearing on the
permeability of a magnetic core that the noise output voltage
decreases in proportion as the permeability increases.
Further, the filter is required to function effectively not
only in the low frequency range but equally in the high
frequency range exceeding 1 MHz. For this reason, the
frequency characteristic of the permeability is required to be
favorable as well.In recent years, the switching power source of the kind
incorporating a magnetic amplifier has been finding widespread
utility.The main component in the magnetic amplifier is a
saturable reactor and is claimed to require a magnetic core 
material excelling in the angular magnetization
characteristic. The aforementioned trend
