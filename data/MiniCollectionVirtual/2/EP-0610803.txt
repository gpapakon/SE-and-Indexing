<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a process for heating the passenger compartment (10) in a motor vehicle, in particular in an electric vehicle, having a heating device (12) to which a stream (40) of air which is drawn off from the passenger compartment (10) via a venting duct (11) is fed, the said stream (40) of air entering the passenger compartment (10) from the heating device (12) via an inlet duct (13). In order to avoid the window panes misting up on the inside with only a low heat setting, at least one partial air stream (40a) which is branched off from the air stream (40) flows through an absorbent material (15) such as zeolite or the like before entering the passenger compartment (10).

Method of heating the passenger compartment (10) in a 
motor vehicle, especially an electric vehicle, having a 

heating device (12) to which there is supplied via an 
air outlet duct (11) an air stream which has been drawn 

out of the passenger compartment (10) and which enters 
the passenger compartment (10) from the heating device 

(12) via an air inlet duct (13), characterised in that, 
in order to dehumidify the passenger compartment (10), at 

least one partial air stream (40a) of adjustable quantity, 
which has been branched off from the air stream 

(40), flows through a sorbent (15), such as zeolite or 
the like, before entering the passenger compartment (10). 
Method according to claim 1, characterised in that 
the partial air stream (40a) is branched off from the air 

outlet duct (11) before the heating device (12). 
Method according to claim 1 or 2, characterised in 
that the partial air stream (40a) is returned to the air 

outlet duct (11) before the heating device (12). 
Method according to any one of claims 1 to 3, characterised 
in that a predeterminable quantity of fresh air 

is supplied to the air stream (40) before the partial 
air stream (40a) is branched off. 
Method according to any one of claims 1 to 4, characterised 
in that the partial air stream (40a) and the air 

stream (40) are in each case conveyed by a fan (20, 21). 
Apparatus for carrying out the method according to 
any one of claims 1 to 5, wherein the heating device (12) 

is connected to the passenger compartment (10) via an air 
inlet duct (11) which supplies the air stream (40) and  

 
via an air outlet duct (13) which removes the air stream 

(40), characterised in that, parallel to a duct section 
(11a), a drying duct (14) is connected via air stream 

control elements (30, 31), which drying duct (14) is 
completely filled with a sorbent (15), such as zeolite or 

the like, over a portion of its flow path. 
Apparatus according to claim 6, characterised in that 
the drying duct (14) has a chamber (19) of predeterminable 

receiving capacity which contains the sorbent (15). 
Apparatus according to claim 6 or 7, characterised in 
that an air discharge duct (17) opens into the drying 

duct (14), via an air stream control element (32), 
preferably upstream of the chamber (19) in relation to 

the partial air stream (40a), and a heating device (16) 
is arranged in the drying duct (14), preferably downstream 

of the chamber in relation to the partial air 
stream (40a). 
Apparatus according to any one of claims 6 to 8, 
characterised in that the drying duct (14) is arranged 

parallel to a duct section (11a) of the air outlet duct 
(11). 
Apparatus according to any one of claims 6 to 9, 
characterised in that a fan (20) is arranged in the air 

outlet duct (11), between the passenger compartment (10) 
and the air stream control element (31) for connecting 

the drying duct (14). 
Apparatus according to any one of claims 6 to 9, 
characterised in that a fan (20) is arranged in the air 

outlet duct (11) immediately upstream of the heating 
device (12).  

 
Apparatus according to any one of claims 6 to 9, 
characterised in that a fan (21) is arranged in the 

drying duct (14), preferably upstream of the chamber 
(19). 
Apparatus according to any one of claims 10 to 12, 
characterised in that a fresh-air duct (18) is additionally 

connected to the fan (20).
