<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to thyristors of the type including field
effect transistors (PETS) for both turning on and turning off the
thyristors, and particularly to an improved thyristor having
turn-on FETs of increased capacity for more rapidly turning on
the thyristors.FET controlled thyristors, also known as MCTs (Metal-oxide-semiconductor
Controlled Thyristors), are now generally known and
described, for example, in US Patents 4816892 and 4857977, the
subject matter of which is incorporated herein by reference. In
such thyristors, turn off is accomplished by diverting current
from one of the base regions around (rather than through)
the p-n junction formed by the base region and its adjacent
emitter region, thereby turning off injection of charge carriers
from the emitter into the base. Because generally large current
densities are involved, the diverting path length must be
relatively short, to prevent high voltage drops therealong, and
the thyristors are thus made of a plurality of small cells, each
cell being small enough to provide a short current diverting
path. The cells are connected in parallel to provide high
power capacity in the composite thyristor. The mechanism for turning off each cell comprises a field effect
transistor disposed within each cell at a surface thereof, the
channel region of the FETs serving as low resistance switches for
creating the current diverting path.Turning on of such thyristors is accomplished by basically short
circuiting a portion of one of the blocking p-n junctions of the
thyristor and injecting current from one of the thyristor main
terminals directly into one of the base regions for forward
biasing the emitter region adjacent thereto. The mechanism for
turning on the thyristor also comprises FETs at the substrate
surface, the channels of which selectively provide low resistance,
paths through the blocking p-n junctions.In order to turn off the thyristor, a relatively large proportion
of the current flowing between the device main terminals must be
diverted through the channels of the turn-off FETS. Obviously,
the channels must be sufficiently low in impedance to carry the
current. Conversely, in order to turn on a thyristor, only
relatively small amounts of current must be injected into the
base region. This is because, once a small portion of an emitter
p-n junction is forward biased to inject current into the base
region, the process becomes self-sustaining and the initially
small turned-on portion of each cell rapidly expands to fully
turn on all other
