<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a process and composition
for improved mutual compatibility of olefin-based
polymers and polar polymers having nitrogen functionality,
in oil.A variety of polymeric and oligomeric additives are
sometimes added to lubricating oil compositions and concentrates
in order to improve the performance properties of
the oil. One class of such compounds is olefin-based
polymers, which are often used as viscosity modifiers.
Another class of such compounds is polar, nitrogen-containing
polymers, which likewise are often used as viscosity
modifiers, and which further can be used to impart dispersant
performance to an additive packages. Materials from
each of these classes normally exhibit a reasonable degree
of solubility in oil or in similar hydrocarbon solvents.
That is to say, individually members of each class of
compound can normally be dissolved in oil in a sufficient
quantity to provide a concentrate for later dilution to
prepare a fully formulated lubricant.However, it is often observed that these classes of
additives cannot be satisfactorily used together, particularly
in a concentrate. For reasons which are not fully
understood, concentrates which contain both oil-soluble,
olefin-based polymers and oil-soluble polar polymers having
nitrogen functionality often undergo a physical or chemical
interaction which leads to incompatibility between the
species as evidenced by phase separation. Phase separation,
as used in this application, is to be interpreted
broadly and can be evidenced by the development of haziness
upon mixing of two otherwise transparent solutions or by
the failure of a mixture of polymers of the two types to
form a clear solution when mixed in oil. In severe cases
the phase separation can be evidenced by the gross physical 
separation of the mixture into two or more phases of
liquids, solids, or semisolids.Such phase separation is almost always undesirable.
Concentrates which exhibit severe phase separation may
require stirring or heating in order to restore gross
uniformity and to permit the concentrate to be effectively
used. Even minor instances of phase separation are undesirable
to the extent that they detract from the appearance
and marketability of the concentrates. This incompatibility
is most often a problem at temperatures of -18 to +65°C,
which represents in many cases the range of temperatures at
which concentrates of such additives are shipped or stored.
The present invention provides a way to avoid such problems
of incompatibility among
