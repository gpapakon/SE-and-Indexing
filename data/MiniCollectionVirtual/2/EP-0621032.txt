<ABSTRACT>
An oral drug delivery device for delivering a drug either intermittently or to a pre-selected 
region of the gastro-intestinal tract, particularly to the colon, consists of an a solid core 

comprising an active agent coated with a delay jacket, then coated with a semi-permeable 
membrane which is optionally drilled to provide a release orifice, and then optionally 

further coated with an enteric material. The device delivers substantially all of the active 
agent to the targeted site.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to tablets which are time-controlled to release active agent
intermittently or at a pre-selected region of the gastro-intestinal tract, specifically the
colon.Parametric drug delivery refers to drug release in synchrony with its temporal
requirements or optimal absorption site, thereby maximizing therapeutic effect while
simultaneously minimizing side-effects or in vivo degradation. An example of parametric
drug delivery is delivery of a drug to a pre-selected region of the gastro-intestinal
tract,
such as the colon. Another example is delivery of a drug intermittently at pre-selected
times such that the patient receives the drug when needed.Delivery of a beneficial drug in the colon has been the goal of research projects. Many
drugs are rendered ineffective by the enzymes present in the fluids of the upper
gastro-intestinal tract, particularly protein or peptide-like drugs. Some drugs are more
readily or more predictably absorbed by the colonic tissue than by that in the upper
gastro-intestinal tract.Delivery of a beneficial drug in the colon is also therapeutically indicated to treat diseased
colonic tissue. In such circumstances, the drug should not be absorbed prior to
localization in the colon lest its concentrations be diminished or even depleted prior to
reaching the intended site of action. Such treatment would be beneficial for a variety of
colonic diseases including inflammatory bowel disease, colitis ulcerosa, enteritis,
regionalis Crohn, chronic nonspecific colitis, and diverticulitis.Prior treatments have been attempted rectally using suppositories and enemas. Rectal
administration, while often more effective than oral administration, is limited in that most
rectally administrable dosage forms are capable of producing the intended result only in
the immediate area, not reaching the upper portions of the colon. This is because the
length of the colon reached is volume dependent, usually reaching only as far as the
splenic flexure. Furthermore, if the patient suffers from severe inflammation of the 
rectum, he may experience difficulty with retention enemas.An orally administrable dosage form to treat colonic diseases would usually be preferred
and is often required. Orally administrable treatments, using tablets, capsules, and the like,
have been attempted. However, to reach the colon intact, the dosage form must withstand
the rigors of the transit through the gastro-intestinal tract. These rigors include at least a
million-fold variation in hydrogen ion
