<ABSTRACT>
The combination of a bag (10) and tubes (24,26) connected thereto
for use in pharmaceutical manufacturing and for holding

health care related solutions is formed entirely of
silicone. This avoids the previous problem of the

releasing into the held fluids of plasticizers or plastic
additives contained in the PVC material making up prior

bags.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a bag assembly for use in
pharmaceutical manufacturing and for holding health care
related solutions and, more particularly, to an improved
bag assembly manufactured of silicone.At the present time, virtually all bags used by the
pharmaceutical industry and for holding health care
related solutions (such as intravenous bags) are
manufactured of polyvinyl chloride (PVC). PVC is a
commonly used inexpensive plastic material which is
naturally hard. To soften such material so that it can
be used as a flexible bag and as flexible tubing,
plasticizers such as phthalate esters are added to the
PVC to soften it. Recently there has been concern that
phthalates may leach from the PVC to which they have been
added, thereby contaminating aqueous fluids held in PVC
bags and traveling through PVC tubing. Since PVC bags
are used to store intravenous solutions and blood for
transfusions, phthalates which leach from the PVC are
infused directly into a patient's bloodstream. It would
therefore be desirable to have a phthalate-free bag and
tubing for such purposes. It is known that silicone is a relatively inert
chemical in aqueous solutions, i.e., it does not react
with contacting liquids or leach chemicals into
contacting liquids. Accordingly, the present invention
provides the combination of at least one silicone tube
having an open central passageway and a flexible silicone
membrane formed into a tubular shape with opposed ends.
The membrane tubular shape is larger in diameter than the
tube. Each tube extends into a respective end of the
membrane so that the respective open central passageway
of the tube is in communication with the interior of the
tubular shaped membrane. Each of the membrane ends is
flattened and sealed to itself and to a respective tube,
thereby forming a bag assembly.
In accordance with an aspect of this invention, the
flexible silicone membrane is formed as a seamless tube.
In accordance with another aspect of this invention,
the flexible silicone membrane is a silicone sheet having
opposed edges overlapped and joined together so that the
membrane attains a tubular configuration.The foregoing will be more readily apparent upon
reading the following description in conjunction with the
drawings in which like elements in different figures
thereof are identified by the same reference numeral and
wherein:
FIGURE 1 is a plan view of a first embodiment of the
present invention;FIGURE 2 is a perspective view of an alternate
embodiment of the present invention;FIGURE 3 is a cross

<CLAIMS>
In combination:

at least one silicone tube having an open central
passageway; and
a flexible silicone membrane formed into a tubular
shape with opposed ends;

wherein the membrane tubular shape is larger in
diameter than the at least one tube, each of the at least

one tube extends into a respective end of the membrane so
that the respective open central passageway of the tube

is in communication with the interior of the tubular
shaped membrane, and each of the membrane ends is

flattened and sealed to itself and to a respective one of
the at least one tube.
The combination according to Claim 1 wherein:

said flexible silicone membrane is formed as a
seamless tube.
The combination according to Claim 1 wherein:

said flexible silicone membrane is a silicone sheet
having opposed edges overlapped and joined together so

that said membrane attains a tubular configuration.
The combination according to Claim 1 wherein
said at least one silicone tube consists of two silicone

tubes arranged substantially co-axially at opposite ends
of the membrane.
The combination according to Claim 1 wherein
said at least one tube is terminated at its distal end by

a silicone flange surrounding the open central
passageway.
The combination according to Claim 5 further
comprising for each of said at least one tube:


a stainless steel backup cup mounted on the tube and
having a surface portion complemental to the surface of

the flange facing the membrane;
whereby a pair of tubes can be coupled together by

clamping their respective backup cups.
