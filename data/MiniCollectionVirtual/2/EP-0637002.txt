<ABSTRACT>
Method for structuring objects of remote transactions in a physical memory space (20) of an on-board equipment including an electronic package (11) comprising a control and data processing unit to which is connected a first memory (8) reserved for the recording of such objects, a microcomputer chip card reader (9) intended for recording such objects in a second memory (12) provided on the chip card (2), and means of transmission reception to a fixed station (3), characterised in that there is provision to partition the physical memory space (20) defined by the first (8) and the second (12) memories into several logical memory spaces (21, 22, 23, 24), each object of remote transactions to be recorded in the physical memory space (20) being identified by a logical address including a first field (IdE) indicating the logical memory space of location of such an object and a second field (IdO) indicating an object logical number.

A method of structuring remote transaction objects in a physical
memory space (20) of on-board equipment comprising an electronics

unit (11) including a control and data processing unit to which is
connected a first memory zone (8) for recording such objects, a

microprocessor smart card reader (9) intended for recording such
objects in a second memory (12) provided on the smart card, and means

for transmitting to/receiving from a fixed station (3), the method
being characterized in that the physical memory space (20) defined by

the first (8) and second (12) memories is partitioned into a
plurality of logical memory spaces (21, 22, 23, 24), each remote

transaction object to be recorded in the physical memory space (20)
being identified by a logical address comprising a first field (IdE)

indicative of the logical memory space in which such an object is
located and a second field (Id0) indicative of a logical object

number.
A method according to claim 1, in which the physical memory space
is partitioned into four logical memory spaces, one of which (21)

corresponds to the memory space defined by the second memory.
A method according to claim 1 or claim 2, characterized in that
when the smart card (2) is inserted in said reader (9), at least some

of the objects contained in said second memory (12) are duplicated in
a logical memory space (22) of said first memory (8).
