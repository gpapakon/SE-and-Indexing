<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a novel chromanol
glycoside and a method for the production thereof. More
particularly, it relates to a novel water-soluble
antioxidant resulting from bond of a sugar to a 2-substituted
alcohol and excelling in chemical stability and
to a method for the production thereof.For a long time, the formation of lipid peroxide has
been known as a cause for degradation of food in quality.
It has been recently established that this substance in
biological system has bearing on various diseases including
arteriosclerosis, aging, and cancer, for example. Thus, the
development of an antioxidant which fulfills the function of
repressing the formation of lipid peroxide induced as by
active oxygen has been attracting growing attention not only
in the field of foodstuffs but also in the field of
cosmetics, the field of medicines, and many other fields.As naturally occurring antioxidants, tocopherols,
gallic acid, ascorbic acid, glutathione, and β-carotene have
been known. 2(3)-tert-butyl-4-hydroxyanisole and 3,5-tert-butyl-4-hydroxytoluene
which have been synthesized for the
purpose of keeping foodstuffs from oxidation of lipid have
been also known as antioxidants.The tocopherols excel the other antioxidants
mentioned above in the ability to suppress oxidation. Thus,
they have been finding extensive utility in the fields of
foodstuffs, cosmetics, and medicines. Since this
outstanding antioxidant activity of tocopherols is ascribed
to the chroman ring, 6-hydroxy-2,5,7,8-tetramethyl chroman-2-carboxylic
acid (hereinafter referred to as "Trolox"(registered trade mark ))
derived from tocopherol by the substitution of a carboxyl
group for the isoprenoid side chain at the 2 position 
thereof has already found recognition as a commercial
product. Besides, 2-substituted alcohols of tocopherols
have been known.Since the tocopherols are viscous oily substances
insoluble in water, they cannot be used as solutions in the
form of injections or oral medicines. Trolox and 2-substituted
alcohols show extremely low solubility in water.As means for vesting these compounds with the
solubility in water, such methods as (a) addition of a
surfactant, (b) coverage with cyclodextrin, and (c) chemical
modification (esterification) by the use of a water-soluble
compound are conceivable. The methods of (a) and (b)
require a surfactant or cyclodextrin in a fairly large
amount and, therefore, entail heavy adulteration of relevant
compounds with an inherently extraneous substance as a
serious problem. Actually these
