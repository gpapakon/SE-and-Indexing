<ABSTRACT>
Catenary wire support which comprises a base element (1) which can be mounted on a ceiling (2) of a structure and a securing column (9) which can be secured on one side therein and consists essentially of a pipe (10) for securing an insulator (11) with a contact wire feeder ear or power rail clamp mounted thereon, the base element (1) having on its surface (3) facing the ceiling (2) of the structure at least one rolling surface (5, 6) by means of which the contact wire feeder ear or power rail clamp can be fixed in terms of its angle of inclination in the plane formed by the longitudinal axis of the securing column (9) and the mid perpendicular of the travelling plane. In such a catenary wire support, a contact wire which is secured in the contact wire feeder ear or a power rail which is secured in the power rail clamp can be easily aligned with track elevations.

Catenary support, which comprises a basic body (1) 
fastenable to the roof (2) of a structure and a 

supporting column (9), which is held in said basic 
body and substantially comprises a tube (10) for 

holding an insulator (11), to which a contact wire 
or contact rail terminal is fastened,
 
characterized in
 
that the basic body (1) at its surface (3) directed 

towards the roof (2) of the structure has at least 
one rolling surface (5, 6), which extends at right 

angles to the direction of travel and by means of 
which the longitudinal axis of the supporting column 

(9) is fixable parallel to the mid-perpendicular of 
the travelling plane or in the mid-perpendicular of 

the travelling plane. 
Catenary support according to claim 1,
 
characterized in
 
that the basic body (1) comprises a tubular holding 

part (8), in which the supporting column (9) is 
held. 
Catenary support according to claim 1,
 
characterized in
 
that the basic body (1) in its surface (3) directed 

towards the roof (2) of the structure has a groove 
(4) extending parallel to the rolling direction for 

receiving a guiding retention rail (7), which is 
fastened to the roof (2) of the structure. 
Catenary support according to claim 3,
 
characterized in
 
that the basic body (1) on either side of the 

contact line or contact wire terminal has an oblong  
 

hole (12, 13), which extends parallel to the groove 
(4) and through which in each case a fastening screw 

(14, 15) screwable into the guiding retention rail 
(7) is passed. 
Catenary support according to claim 4,
 
characterized in
 
that the basic body (1) at its underside in the 

region of the oblong holes (12, 13) has radial, 
convex sliding surfaces (16, 17). 
Catenary support according to claim 5,
 
characterized in
 
that resting on the sliding surfaces (16, 17) are 

compensating discs (20, 21), the concave sliding 
surfaces of which have the same radius as the 

sliding surfaces (16, 17). 
Catenary support according to claim 5,
 
characterized in
 
that the radius of the sliding surfaces (16, 17) is 

adapted to the rolling radius of the rolling 
surfaces (5, 6) in such a way that the compensating 

discs (20, 21) always lie with their plane surfaces 
parallel to retaining nuts (18, 19) which are 

screwed onto the fastening screws (14, 15). 
Catenary support according to claim 1,
 
characterized in
 
that the supporting column (9) comprises at least 

one damping device (22) for damping the vibrations 

transmitted to the contact wire or contact rail. 
Catenary support according to claim 8,
 
characterized in
 
that the damping device (22) is disposed above the 

tube (10) and held in the basic body (1).  
 
Catenary support according to claim 8,
 
characterized in
 
that the damping device (22) is disposed in the tube 

(10) for holding the insulator (11). 
Catenary support according to claim 8,
 
characterized in
 
that the tube (10) of the supporting column (9) 

takes the form of a damping device (22). 
Catenary support according to one of claims 8 to 11,
 
characterized in
 
that the damping device (22) takes the form of a 

metal/rubber bush (22), the metal/rubber bush (22) 
comprising an outer tube (221) and an inner tube 

(222) as well as an interlying rubber layer (223) 
which acts as a damping element. 
Catenary support according to claim 11,
 
characterized in
 
that the damping device (22) is frictionally 

connected by means of a connection screw (224) to 
the insulator (11).
