<ABSTRACT>
A mast base comprises a body, formed partly by a generally rectangular container (12), provided with four upper corner fittings (13), located at the upper end thereof, and with four lower corner fittings (14), located at the lower end thereof, and partly by a stationary supporting frame (15), placed upon the container (12) and attached to the four upper corner fittings (13). In order to support the body (12, 15) in a stable position on the ground, four supporting legs (16) are provided, which may be placed in positions, in which they project laterally each from one corner of the body (12, 15). Each supporting leg (16) is composed of one lower arm (18), at its inner end connected to a lower corner fitting (14), and one upper arm (17), at its inner inner end connected to the stationary supporting frame (15) or to an upper corner fitting (13). Moreover, at its outer end, each supporting leg (16) is provided with a supporting foot (32).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a mast base,
especially for a temporarily erected mast.Within the telecommunication field, it is often
required to erect antenna masts temporarily for shorter
or longer periods of time. Since the masts in question
may have a height of several tenths of meters, for instance
30 to 40 meters, although the masts are intended
to be erected only temporarily, it is necessary to place
them upon a highly stable base. For this reason, even
in connection with temporarily erected masts, it has
been common practice to utilize a stationary foundation,
formed by a mast base which is firmly anchored
in the ground and which is of a kind similar to that utilized
for permanently erected masts. However, a mast
base, which is firmly anchored in the ground, is unfavourable
in several respects. Firstly, both the construction
as well as a subsequent removal of such a mast
base is very time-consuming and costly. Additionally,
the use of such a mast base implies a substantial penetration
into the ground, which is totally unacceptable in
certain environmentally sensitive regions, such as in
mountain regions or in costal regions where the rock
is exposed. In order to avoid the above disadvantages,
it has been proposed to utilize a transport vehicle
of special design as a mast base for a temporarily
erected mast. However, such a transport vehicle is very
expensive. Moreover, it does not offer a sufficiently
stable foundation for a mast of the abovementioned high
height to permit the mast to remain erected thereon
unattended during any longer periods of time. In this connection, reference is made to US-A
2 998 106 which discloses a trailer, in which a complicated
mast erecting device is incorporated to facilitate
a successive erection of a mast comprising a plurality
of mast sections by connecting said sections to each
other and elevating them in successive steps. At least
during the erection of the mast, the trailer is also
used as the required mast base for supporting the mast.
In order to be able to fulfil its desired function, this
mast base is of a kind comprising a body and four supporting
legs, which are intended to support the body in
a stable position on the ground and which are arranged
to be placed in positions in which they project laterally
each from one of four different corners of the body,
each supporting leg being provided, at its outer end,
with a supporting foot, by means of which it may be placed
resting on the ground. However, the fact that the body
of the mast base is formed by

A mast base, especially for a temporarily erected
mast, said mast base comprising a body and four supporting

legs, which are intended to support the body in
a stable position on the ground and which are arranged

to be placed in positions, in which they project laterally
each from one of four different corners of the body,

each supporting leg being provided, at its outer end,
with a supporting foot, by means of which it may be

placed resting on the ground, characterized in that
the body is formed partly by a generally rectangular

container (12), provided with four upper corner fittings
(13), located at the upper end thereof, and with

four lower corner fittings (14), located at the lower end
thereof, and partly by a stationary mast supporting frame

(15), which is placed upon the container (12) and attached
to the four upper corner fittings (13) of the container

(12), and in that each supporting leg is composed of
one lower arm (18), at its inner end connected to a

lower corner fitting (14) of the container (12), and
one upper arm (17), at its inner end connected to the

stationary supporting frame (15) or to an upper corner
fitting (13) of the container (12).
A mast base according to claim 1, characterized
in that said mast base also comprises a movable mast

supporting frame (34), mounted on the stationary supporting
frame (15) and pivotally movable relatively to

the stationary supporting frame around an approximately
horizontal axis (35).
A mast base according to claim 1 or 2, characterrized
in that at least one arm (17) of each supporting

leg (16) is composed of two members (17A, 17B), which
are mounted longitudinally displaceable relatively to

each other and which are lockable in different relative
displacement positions, and in that, at their outer 

ends, the two arms (17, 18) are pivotally connected
to each other for pivoting movement relatively to each

other around a horizontal transverse pivot axis (19),
while, at their inner ends, they are each pivotally

movable relatively to the body of the mast base around
a horizontal transverse axis (21, 22).
A mast base according to any of the preceding
claims, characterized in that, at their inner ends,

the two arms (17, 18) of each supporting leg (16) are
connected to each other by means of an approximately

vertical connecting member (20).
A mast base according to any of the preceding
claims, characterized in that the supporting feet (32)

are mounted vertically adjustable on the supporting
legs (16).
