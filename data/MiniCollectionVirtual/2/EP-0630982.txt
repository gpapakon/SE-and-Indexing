<ABSTRACT>
A steering wheel (32) is cast as a unitary casting from an alloy which 
includes 11,5 - 14% by weight of silicon and 350 - 450 parts per million 

of strontium. The invention extends to a method of forming such a 
wheel the method including the step of rotating the mould (10) in which 

the wheel is cast. The mould is rotated at relatively high rotational 
speeds so that the wheel experiences a pressure of 100g to 250g during 

casting. The optimum rotational speed is determined using a formula 
disclosed in the specification.

<DESCRIPTION>
THIS invention relates to a steering wheel, and more particularly, to an
aluminium steering wheel.Steering wheels are generally fabricated from a number of different
components including a metal rim, spokes, and a central hub which
connects to the steering column. The rim is generally covered with a
resilient foam material or the like after the metal components have been
interconnected. There are various problems with this prior art type of
steering wheel including problems relating to connecting the distal ends
of the spokes to the rim. Generally the point of connection between the
rim and the spokes is found to be a zone of weakness for most wheels.Steering wheels are safety critical components in most vehicles. It is
important that the steering wheel is able to absorb a high impact load
and preferably will deform under load rather than break. It is well
known that cast materials tend to shatter rather than bend. It is also
known that castings often crack and, accordingly, casting processes are
not usually considered appropriate for the manufacturer of steering
wheels.Applicant is aware of certain prior art which contemplates cast
aluminium steering wheels. European applications nos. EP-A-0292038,
EP-A-0412605 and EP-A-0050309 all deal with the concept of cast
steering wheels. However, none of the prior art specifications referred 
to satisfy Applicant's requirements that the steering wheel be cast as a
one piece casting, that the wheel is of high strength and relatively
resilient, and that it can be made crack-free.According to the invention there is provided a steering wheel which is
cast as a one-piece aluminium alloy casting, said alloy including 11.5 -
14% by weight of silicon, and 350 - 450 parts per million strontium. The
preferred range is 12.5 - 12.6% silicon and 380 - 420 parts per million
strontium.The steering wheel may be cast in a casting process which includes the
step of rotating the mould about the axis of the steering wheel.An example of an alloy for the steering wheel comprises:
