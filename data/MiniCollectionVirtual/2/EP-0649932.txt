<ABSTRACT>
A method is described, for determining the quantity and/or the type of fabric introduced in a 
laundry washing machine and a washing machine implementing such a method. The main 

feature of the described method consists in the fact that the quantity and/or the type of fabric 
are detected by monitoring the interventions for restoring the washing liquid level in the 

laundry washing machine controlled by a level sensor, in particular an electromechanical first 
level pressure switch.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention refers to a method for determining the type, or the type and the
quantity, of fabric introduced in a laundry washing machine, and to a laundry washing
machine implementing such a method.It is known to indirectly verify the quantity of clothes to be washed by measuring, with a
turbine flow meter (of the type based on the Hall effect or infrared rays) being associated to a
microprocessor, the quantity of water introduced in the laundry washing machine.Said partial solution however has the drawback of requiring at least one costly additional
components, with respect to those normally present in a laundry washing machine, with the
consequent increase in cost.Other known methods for measuring the weight of clothes in a laundry washing machine are
the following:
method of measuring the electric current (that is in relation with the torque) absorbed by
the motor of the laundry washing machine, in order to place the basket with the clothes to
be washed in motion;method of measuring the energy necessary for passing from a certain inertial state, being
defined by a certain speed of the basket of the laundry washing machine, to another inertial
state, being defined by a different speed of the same basket.The measuring of the weight realised with said methods however have the drawback of being
uncertain, due to the basket mass (which are of the same order as the clothes), the features of
the means for transmitting the motion from the motor to the basket (i.e. the belt tension and 
its elastic and geometric features) and by the high dispersion of the characteristics of the
motors used. Said systems therefore require the use of a motor having high features (i.e. which
assures that the exerted torque is in fact proportional to the weight of the clothes) and means
able to measure the current absorbed, with the consequent necessity of equipping the machine
with a complex electronic control system.Methods are also known, for detecting the quantity and/or the type of fabric, which are
based on the monitoring of the interventions, controlled by a pressure switch, for
restoring the washing liquid level in the laundry washing machine. Examples of said
methods can be found for instance in DE-A-41 22 307, FR-A-2 474 547 or DE-A-34 46
288. The precision of said methods however depends upon the differential of the
pressure switch, as it will be clear in the following of the present description.Thus, in other words, said methods also have the drawback of being expensive, complex and
not always reliable.The

Method for determining the type, or the type and quantity, of fabric introduced in a
laundry washing machine, said laundry washing machine comprising:


a washing tank (2), for containing a washing liquid,
an electrovalve (13), for controlling the supply of said washing liquid to said tank (2),
a basket, rotatable within said tank (2), for containing the laundry to be washed,
a level sensor (1,3-7) of the washing liquid within said tank (2),
an electronic control system, comprising permanent memory means within which
operational instructions are stored,

wherein at the beginning of a washing program,

the control system controls said electrovalve (13) for carrying out a first washing liquid

supply to said tank (2) up to an initial level;
said basket is then suitably rotated for favouring the washing liquid absorption by the
laundry and the consequent lowering of the liquid level in the tank (2),

the method being characterised in that

after said first washing liquid supply up to said initial level is performed, said basket is
rotated for an established time interval (T), the duration of which being such to allow the

passage of said level sensor (1,3-7) from its full state to its empty state;
once said established time interval (T) has elapsed, the control system controls said
electrovalve (13) for supplying new washing liquid to said tank, until the passage of said

level sensor (1,3-7) from its empty state to its full state is determined, so restoring said
initial level of the washing liquid within said tank (2);
the control system determines the type of fabric of the laundry contained in the basket in
function of operational instructions stored within said memory means and the quantity of

said new washing liquid supplied to said tank (2), which represents the quantity of washing
liquid absorbed by the fabric during said established time interval (T).
Method, according to claim 1, characterised in that, after the type of fabric has
been determined by the control system, further restoring operations of the liquid level within 

said tank (2) are controlled through said level sensor (1,3-7).
Method, according to claim 2, characterised in that said control system provides for
a count of the number of the restoring operations controlled through said level sensor (1,3-7)

and/or the detection of the distribution over time of the restoring operations controlled
through said level sensor (1,3-7) and/or the measurement of the sum of the times of the

restoring operations.
Method, according to claim 3, characterised in that the control system determines
the quantity of laundry contained in the basket in function of the measure of the total time of

said restoring operations and in function of the type of fabric.
Method, according to at least one of the preceding claims, characterised in that the
type and/or the quantity of fabric is determined by the control system using the fuzzy logic

technique.
Method, according to at least one of previous claims, characterised in that the
information concerning the type and/or and the quantity of fabric is used by the control system

for managing the operation of the laundry washing machine, in particular for determining the
detergent dosage.
Laundry washing machine comprising:

a washing tank (2), for containing a washing liquid,
an electrovalve (13), for controlling the supply of said washing liquid to said tank (2),

an electronic control system having permanent memory means within which operational
instructions are stored, said electronic control system comprising:


means for controlling, at the beginning of a washing program, said electrovalve (13) in
order to carry out a first washing liquid supply to said tank (2) up to an initial level;
means for suitably rotating said basket, in order to favour the washing liquid absorption
by the laundry and the consequent lowering of the liquid level in the tank (2),

characterised in that said control system further comprises 

means for rotating said basket for an established time interval (T) once said first washing
liquid supply up to said initial level is performed, the duration of said time interval (T) being

such to allow the passage of said level sensor (1,3-7) from its full state to its empty state;

sensor (1,3-7) from its empty state to the full state is determined;
