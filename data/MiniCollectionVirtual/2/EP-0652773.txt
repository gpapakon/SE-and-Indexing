<ABSTRACT>
The use of nor- and homo- bile acids derivatives as absorption enhancers for medicaments. Said derivatives show the advantage of improving the absorption of medicaments through mucosae without being metabolized by the intestinal flora, thus allowing a fast excretion. Moreover, the derivatives of the invention have a negligible toxicity.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to the use of nor- and
homo- bile acids derivatives (hereinafter named
NORAB and HOMOAB, respectively) as absorption enhancers
for the manufacture of medicaments.Particularly, the invention relates to the use of
nor- and homo- bile acids derivatives having
respectively the following formulae:

and 

wherein:

the corresponding NORAB and HOMOAB conjugated respectively
in C23 and C25 with taurine, glycine and alanine.The present trend for pharmacological therapy,
particularly in the case of slight disorders or of
treatments involving multiple administrations repeated
in time, and therapies for conscious patients, is the
self-administration by the patient itself. From this
point of view, the preferred administration routes are
the enteral, i.e. buccal, rectal and intranasal ones.The medicament administered through these routes, 
once released from the pharmaceutic form containing it
(tablet, suppository, aerosol, and the like), must
cross the different mucosae coating the gastrointestinal
tract and the nasal cavity, in order to enter the
circulatory stream and be distributed in the various
body districts thus reaching the action site.Due to the complex nature of the mucosae and the
different chemical structure of the medicaments, the
crossing of the mucosae involves different difficulties,
depending on the kind of medicament and the type
of mucosa.One of the main problems involved in the design of
medicaments consists in the need to give the pharmacologically
active compound those hydrophilic characteristics
which are generally required to have the active
principle dissolved in the biological liquids (serum,
interstitial liquid) and sometimes also lipophilic
characteristics to cross the mucosa, which generally
consists of a more or less complex cell barrier.This approach finds a number of difficulties from
the viewpoint of the medicament design, both in the
synthesis and in the
