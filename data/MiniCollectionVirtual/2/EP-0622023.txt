<ABSTRACT>
In the preservation of vegetables, the vegetables are exposed (a) in first stage to a temp. within a first predetermined range, for a first predetermined time, and then (b) to a second predetermined temp., higher than the first temp., for a second predetermined time, shorter than the first time. The duration and temp. of the first treatment are such that the texture of the vegetables is fixed and stabilised by enzymatically catalysed reactions, and the second duration and time are such that at the end of the second period, an F sum value ensuring a predetermined keeping quality of the treated vegetables is reached.

Process to preserve vegetables, the vegetable, in 
a first treatment step, being exposed to a first 

preset temperature within a first preset temperature 
range for a first preset time interval, and, 

in a second treatment step immediately following 
the first treatment step, to a second temperature 

being higher than the first temperature, within a 
second preset temperature range which comprises 

higher temperatures than the first temperature 
range for a time interval that is shorter than the 

first time interval,
characterized in that
 
the length of the first time interval and the 

first temperature are selected such that, by enzymatically 
catalyzed reactions, a fixation and 

solidification of the vegetable texture is 
achieved, and that the length of the second time 

interval and the second temperature are chosen 
such that, at the end of the second time interval, 

a preset sum-F-value is achieved for the final 
product being a preserve of long shelf-life. 
The process of claim 1, characterized in that both 
treatment steps are carried out in the presence of 

a small quantity of free water forming a so-called 
infusion.  

 
The process of claim 2, characterized in that the 
infusion quantity is reduced to a minimum value of 

1 vol. % of the volume of the space between product 
particles. 
The process of claim 3, characterized in that the 
infusion quantity is reduced to 2 to 8 vol.%, in 

particular to max. 3 vol.%. 
Process according to one of claims 1 through 4, 
characterized in that the vegetable is cut to vegetable 

particles. 
Process of claim 5, characterized in that the vegetable 
is cut to vegetable particles the largest 

size of which is 4 to 15 mm, preferrably 6 to 12 
mm, and particularly 8 to 10 mm. 
Process according to claims 2 and 5, characterized 
in that the small infusion quantity is produced by 

immersing the vegetable particles into a dipping 
prior to the two treatment steps, that they are 

lifted out of the dipping and drained, and that 
the drained vegetable particles are subsequently 

filled into a receptacle to accomplish the two 
treatment steps. 
Process according to claim 7, characterized in 
that a preset quantity of a salt forming bivalent 

cations is added to the dipping.  
 
Process according to claim 8, characterized in 
that calcium chloride is added to the dipping. 
Process according to one of claims 7 through 9, 
characterized in that the receptacle is closed before 

the two treatment steps are started with. 
Process according to claim 10, characterized in 
that a vacuum is produced in the receptacle. 
Process acording to claims 10 or 11, characterized 
in that an inert gas is supplied into the receptacle. 
Process according to one of claims 1 through 12, 
characterized in that, for the purpose of carrying 

out the enzymatically catalyzed reactions, inherent 
enzymes of the vegetable to be preserved 

are used. 
Process according to one of claim 1 through 13, 
characterized in that, at least in one of the 

treatment steps, microwaves are used to heat the 
vegetable. 
Process according to one of claims 1 through 14, 
characterized in that, at least in one of treatment 

steps, the vegetable is heated in a pressure 
vessel.  

 
Process according to claims 1 through 15, characterized 
in that it is carried out as a continuous 

process.
