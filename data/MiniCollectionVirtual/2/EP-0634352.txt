<ABSTRACT>
Machine for folding paper handkerchiefs (tissues), napkins (towels, serviettes) and the like according to the method of Claim 1, comprising a plurality of cylinders and rollers for cutting and transverse folding of the paper, in which the folder cylinder (2) consists of a plurality of coaxial cylindrical segments (20) connected in cascade with the interposition of a fixed valve (21) between each pair of segments (20), which is connected to an air-suction source (AS) so as to delimit a corresponding main suction chamber (28), in which the outer surface, that is to say the active surface, of each segment (20) of the said cylinder (2) is channelled longitudinally and, in correspondence with each channel, there is fastened a rectangular plate (23) with several through holes (24), so as to delimit a plurality of chambers (22) which communicate with the said chamber (28) by means of several radial through holes (29), in a sequence which is programmed under the control of the valve (21) with the rotation of the cylinder (2).

Process for folding paper handkerchieves and similar articles, in a machine comprising a
plurality of rollers or cylinders (2,3) for cutting out and folding handkerchieves from a band

(1) continuously unwound from a reel and subdivided into a number of strips or channels
(10), co-operating with auxiliary rollers (4) in cutting stations (T) and folding stations (P),

characterized by the fact that it comprises:

-- in a position corresponding to the handkerchief cutting (T) and folding (P)
stations, the feeding of the paper with a progressive movement (F) from the base of

the machine towards its top, in such a way that the folding of the edges of the
hankerchieves to be folded will be facilitated by the force of gravity acting on the

respective front edge in the direction of travel of the paper after the interruption of
the section in the zone of contact with the corresponding auxiliary roller (4);
-- retention of the product, while being treated, on the external surface of the
corresponding processing rollers (3) and cylinders (2), by means of forced suction

exerted through a number of separate contiguous and coaxial segments (20) of those
rollers (3) and segments (2) and possibly of reduced volume and for each segment

(20) across a number of series of holes (24,35) aligned longitudinally and in such a
manner as to delimit a plurality of chambers (22) which communicate with a main

suction chamber (28) by means of a number of holes passing through several
traversing radial holes in programmed sequence under the control of the valve (21),

with the rotation of the cylinder (3) or roller (2), in such a way as to render possible a
uniform depression over the entire length of their axes, even in the event of reduced

differential pressure values between the interior and the exterior of the rollers (3) and
cylinders (2).
Machine for folding paper handkerchieves, serviettes and similar articles, in accordance
with the process described in Claim 1, comprising a plurality of cylinders and rollers (2, 3)

for the cutting and transversal folding of the paper, characterized by the fact that the folding
cylinder (2) over which the paper runs with a progressive movement (F) from the base of the

machine towards its top, in co-operation with auxiliary rollers (4), is formed by a plurality of
coaxial rical segments (20), connected in unidirectional cascade, a fixed gate (21) being

interposed between each pair of adjacent segments (20) and connected to an air suction
source (AS), in such a way as to delimit a corresponding main suction intake chamber (28);

and that the external i.e. active, surface of each segment (20) of the said cylinder (2) is
longitudinally channelled; and that a rectangular plate (23) with a number of through-holes

(24) is affixed in a position corresponding to each channelling, in such a way as to delimit a
plurality of chambers (22) by means of a number of radial through-holes (29), in succession

programmed by the control of the valve (21) with the rotation of the cylinder (2).
Machine in accordance with Claim 2, characterized by the fact that each segment (20)
of the said cylinder (2) is mounted on a corresponding support (250 keyed onto a horizontal

shaft (26).
Machine in accordance with Claim 2, characterized by the fact that each gate (21) is
connected to the support (25) of the respective segment (26) by means of two bearings (27).
Machine in accordance with Claim 2, characterized by the fact that the cutting cylinder
(3) is made in one piece, with the active surface provided with a number of longitudinal

channellings, each of which has a length equal to the width of one or two operating channels,
and with a rectangular plate (34) having a number of through-holes (35), in such a way as to

delimit a corresponding number of chambers (33), each of which communicates via an
aperture (36) with a fixed gate (33), positioned in accordance with its median line and

connected to the air suction intake installation (AS); the said gate (12) being coaxial with the
cylinder and supported by this latter. 
Machine in accordance with Claim 2, characterized by the fact that the active surface of
the auxiliary rollers (40) is provided with a number of internal suction chambers, having a

length equal to the width of one or two operating channels and connected to corresponding
gates subject to the control of an air suction intake installation (AS); the said suction

chambers being delimited by a corresponding number of longitudinal channellings, produced
on the active surface of the rollers (4) and covered by corresponding plates provided with a

number of through-holes, in such a way as to ensure direct pneumatic communication
between the suction chambers and the active surface of the rollers (4).
