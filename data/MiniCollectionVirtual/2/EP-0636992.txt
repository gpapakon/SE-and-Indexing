<ABSTRACT>
A start bit for setting again a command or a coefficient 
is generated on the basis of a reference signal indicating 

a beginning of data, and is supplied into n stages of 
operators while delaying by a specific period in a delay, so 

that the command or the coefficient stored in the register 
may be set individually for the n stages of operators.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a pipeline operator 
used in microprocessor, digital signal processor or the 
like. A conventional pipeline operator is described below. 
Hereinafter, those describing a command or a coefficient for 
indicating an action to an operator are called download 
data, and the operation for transferring and setting the 
download data to the operator is called downloading. Fig. 9 is a structural diagram of the conventional 
pipeline operator. In Fig. 9, reference numerals 1_1 to 1_n 
denotes operators in n stages (n being a natural number) for 
performing an operation of input data in pipeline system. 
The operators are intended to perform the operation of data  
 
entered according to a content of the download data describing 
the command or the coefficient. Reference numeral 2 
denotes a memory, which stores the download data describing 
commands and coefficients of the operators 1_1 to 1_n. 
Reference numeral 3 denotes an address generator, which 
generates an address for downloading the download data to 
the operators 1_1 to 1_n. An internal constitution of the operators 1_1 to 1_n is 
shown in Fig. 10. In Fig. 10, reference numeral 101 denotes 
a operator main body, which is connected to a preceding 
operator, and perform the operation of the input data. 
Reference numeral 102 denotes a pipeline register, which is 
connected to the operator main body 101, and temporarily 
stores data after performing the operation. Reference 
numeral 103 denotes an internal register, which is connected 
to the operator main body 101, and stores the download data 
downloaded from the memory 2, and the operator main body 101 
performs a specified operation by referring to the internal 
register 103. In thus constituted pipeline operator, operation is  
 
described below. In the first place, using the address 
generated in the address generator 3, the download data 
describing the content to be performed the operation by the 
operators 1_1 to 1_n is read out of the memory 2, and downloaded 
in batch into the internal register 103 of all the 
operators 1_1 to 1_n. At the same time, the download data 
is fed into a first stage operator 1_1, and is performed the 
operation in the operator 1_1. Consequently, one clock 
later, the result of performing the operation in the first 
stage operator 1_1 is transferred into a second stage operator 
1_2, and is performed the operation in the second stage 
operator 1_2. Generally speaking, at a certain clock timing, 
the operation is performed at a k-th
