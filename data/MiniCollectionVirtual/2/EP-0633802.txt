Exercise equipment for strengthening various 
muscle groups, with a stand (12), which has feet and a 

bracing tube (16) that runs upward from them, two 
struts (26, 28) attached so that they rotate on the 

bracing tube (16) and which form the sides of a V, 
contact areas (32, 34) on the struts (26, 28) and a 

spring element (30) between the struts (26, 28), 
characterized in that both struts (26, 28) are 

connected to the bracing tube (16) near the ends that 
face each other, and in that the contact point of the 

spring element (30) can be adjusted lengthwise on at 
least one of the struts (26, 28). 
Exercise equipment according to claim 1, 
characterized in that the distance between the contact 

areas (32, 34) of the two struts (26, 28) can be 
adjusted against the force of the spring (30). 
Exercise equipment according to claims 1 or 2, 
characterized in that the zero position of the distance 

between contact areas (32, 34), defined as no force 
being applied to the contact areas (32, 34), is 

adjustable. 
Exercise equipment according to one of the 
preceding claims, characterized in that the spring 

element is formed by a gas-pressure spring (30). 
Exercise equipment according to one of the 
preceding claims, characterized in that there are 

handles (36, 38) on the ends of the struts (26, 28) 
that face away from each other.  

 
Exercise equipment according to one of the 
preceding claims, characterized in that the stand (12) 

has a seat (14). 
Exercise equipment according to one of the 
preceding claims, characterized in that the bracing 

tube (16) is slanted diagonally upwards and the struts 
(26, 28) are inclined downward. 
Exercise equipment according to one of the 
preceding claims, characterized in that there is a seat 

(14) at the top of the bracing tube (16) and that both 
the seat (14) and the feet (18, 20) have, diagonal to 

the bracing tube (16), areas used as contact points for 
the feet and/or hands. 
Exercise equipment according to claim 8, 
characterized in that the height of the seat (14) can' 

be adjusted relative to the bracing tube (16) by means 
of a screw connection or spring, in particular a gas-pressure 

spring (40). 
Exercise equipment according to one of the 
preceding claims, characterized in that the contact 

areas (32, 34) are padded.
