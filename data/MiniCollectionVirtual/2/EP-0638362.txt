<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention is directed to a titanosilicate
catalyst and a method for preparing the same. The
inventive catalyst exhibits activity in a hydroxylation
reaction of an aromatic compound, an epoxidation reaction
of an olefin or an ammoximation of a ketone using hydrogen
peroxide as an oxidant.Titanosilicate is a type of zeolite having the same
crystalline structure as ZSM-5 and having the composition
xTiO2·(1-x)SiO2. Therein, Si in the crystal lattice is
replaced with Ti instead of Al, and a preparation method
thereof is disclosed by U.S. Patent No. 4,410,501 to
Tarammasso.Titanosilicate is found to have activity in oxidation
reactions of several kinds of organic compounds using
hydrogen peroxide as an oxidant. For example,
titanosilicate is known for use as a catalyst in a
hydroxylation reaction of an aromatic compound, an
epoxidation reaction of an olefin, for production of an 
alcohol or a ketone by oxidation of an alkane and for
production of a ketone oxime by ammoximation of a ketone.A smaller primary particle is generally advantageous
for obtaining a catalyst having high activity, and a
diameter of a micro crystal particle which is formed at
first in a production process ( hereinafter referred to as
a primary particle) of submicron order is preferable.
However, from a practical view point, a smaller primary
particle is difficult to handle, e.g., in isolation and
separation of the catalyst. As a result, the advantage for
use as a solid catalyst is lost.On the other hand, titanosilicate is prepared using
expensive reagents. As a result, a small loss in handling
disadvantageously increases the cost of production, such
that recovery to the high extent is necessary. In order to
achieve economy of production, formation of a large
particle which is formed by a combination of primary
particles, ( hereinafter referred to as a secondary
particle) having the properties of a primary particle and
also having a good handling property as a catalyst is
needed to allow for practical use. However, in the secondary particle prepared according
to the known method, mechanical strength of the secondary
particle is very small, since the primary particle of
titanosilicate fine crystal prepared by the hydrothermal
synthesis simply contact at the boundary of the primary
particle, and is not firmly connected mutually via chemical
bond. That is, when such titanosilicate catalyst is used,
it easily decomposed to primary particles and the handling
property, such as filtration process is not good.A preparation method for
