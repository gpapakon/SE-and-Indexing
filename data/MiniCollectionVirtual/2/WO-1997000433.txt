<ABSTRACT>
The invention concerns a sensor plate (30) for measuring a plurality of fluid pressures. The sensor plate (30) comprises fastening holes (32) distributed in the manner of a matrix over the sensor plate (30). Measuring diaphragms (18) forming end walls of blind holes (20) in the sensor plate (30) are located between the fastening holes (32). Pressure can act on the measuring diaphragms (18) via fluid ducts in a hydraulic unit to which the sensor plate (30) can be screwed. Evaluation is carried out with four strain gauges (24, 25) which are mounted on each measuring diaphragm (18) and are interconnected to form a full bridge (wheatstone bridge). Since the sensor plate (30) can be mounted in a voltage-optimized manner, it can be used to measure different pressures with minimum measurement errors.
