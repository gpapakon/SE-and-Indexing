<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method for processing
a silver halide photographic light-sensitive material, and more
particularly to a light-sensitive material processing method
in which the developed light-sensitive material, even when
super-rapidly processed in a low-replenishment-rate fixing
solution, forms little residual color stain and little fog.With the latest advancement of photographic technology
there arises a strong demand for improving the silver halide
photographic light-sensitive material so as to have a higher
sensitivity, a higher-quality-image-forming capability and a
shorter-time processability than ever before.For example, in the recent medical X-ray diagnostic field,
the increasing number of diagnoses and the increasing number 
of films to be radiographed per diagnosis have now prompted a
strong demand for developing technology capable of not only
rapidly processing a vast number of angiographed films and X-ray
films radiographed in operations but also providing highspeed
and high-quality X-ray images for use in diagnoses.To meet the above demand, a light-sensitive material comprising
silver halide tabular grains have lately been developed.
The tabular grain, since it has a specific surface area
large enough to absorb a lot of a spectrally sensitizing dye,
has the advantage that it enables the reduction in cross-over
rays as well as the sensitivity improvement.The tabular grain, however, is disadvantageous because of
its inferior resistance to pressure. For this reason Japanese
Patent Publication Open to Public Inspection (hereinafter abbreviated
to JP O.P.I.) No. 99433/1984 proposes to improve the
tabular grain's resistance to pressure by having the grain
provided thereinside with a high-silver-iodide content phase,
and JP O.P.I. No. 14636/1986 discloses a method for improving
the pressure resistance by making the iodide content of the
central phase higher than that of the peripheral phase of the
tabular grain.However, these methods based on the use of the iodide are
certainly recognized effective in improving the grain's resistance
to pressure, but, on the other hand, significantly affect
the developing or fixing rate of the grain; for example, if 
the average silver iodide content of the whole grain is raised,
there occurs a problem of not only retarding the developing or
fixing rate of the grain but also resulting in decline of the
grain's solubility in water to thereby cause a residual color
stain-increasing trouble due to sensitizing dyes or other dyes.We, the inventors of
