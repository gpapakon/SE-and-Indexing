<ABSTRACT>
A benzopyran derivative represented by general formula (I), which has a K⁺ channel activating function and thus can be 
widely applied as antiasthmatic, antiepileptic, and so forth. In formula (I), R₁ represents hydrogen or hydroxy; R₂ and R₃ 

represent each lower alkyl, etc.; R₄ and R₅ represent each hydrogen, lower haloalkyl, halogeno, nitro, etc.; X represents 
=O, =S, = N-CN, etc.; and Y represents hydroxy, substituted amino, etc.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a novel benzopyran
derivative which is useful as medicine.Benzopyran derivatives having various pharmacological
effects have been known. For example, various benzopyran
derivatives in which the 4-position carbon atom of
a benzopyran ring is directly linked to a nitrogen atom
are disclosed in Japanese Laid-Open Patent Publications
No. 97974/1985, No. 47416/1986, No. 165317/1988,
No. 196581/1988, No. 201182/1988, No. 303977/1988,
No. 26578/1989, No. 38087/1989, No. 129184/1990 and Journal
of Medicinal Chemistry, Vol. 33, No. 6, pp, 1529-1541, 1990.
In the above documents there is described that said
compounds have an anti-hypertension effect and can be
used for a treatment for heart diseases.Among the benzopyran derivatives disclosed in
the above documents, Cromakalim represented by the
following formula has recently been remarked as a new
kind of a hypotensive drug having an effect on K+ channel
together with Nicorandil and Pinacidil.
Besides, derivatives in which the 4-position
carbon atom of a benzopyran ring is not directly linked to
a nitrogen atom are also disclosed in Japanese Laid-Open
Patent Publications No. 303977/1988 and No. 38087/1989,
Official Gazette of WO 90/14346, Journal of Heterocyclic
Chemistry, Vol. 11 (5), pp. 797-802, 1974 and Journal of
Medicinal Chemistry, Vol. 33, No. 6, pp. 1529-1541, 1990. 
Particularly, in the Official Gazette of WO 90/14346 is
disclosed a similar compound to the compound containing
an amide group or a thioamide group at the 4-position of
a benzopyran ring of the present invention.The present inventors have studied assiduously
about the synthesis of a benzopyran derivative which has
the equivalent or more excellent K+ channel opening
activities than said similar compound and Cromakalim and
in which the 4-position carbon atom of a benzopyran ring
is not directly linked to a nitrogen atom and about K+
channel effect activities. As a result, they have found
that a novel benzopyran derivative to be described below,
which is disclosed in no document, has such pharmacological
activities and accomplished the present invention on the
basis of this finding.The compound of the present invention is a novel
compound represented by the following general formula (I)
having excellent K+ channel opening activities:
