<ABSTRACT>
Saturation device (10) for liquid fuel storage tanks 
comprising a ventilation pipe (11) which is rigidly coupled 

to the top of the tank (2) and is suitable to be connected 
to the outside. One end of a floating saturation pipe (16) 

is articulated to the ventilation pipe (11) and has, at its 
opposite end, a curved tip portion (17) which ensures its 

immersion in the liquid fuel contained in the tank (2). A 
coaxial floating pipe (18) is rigidly coupled to the 

saturation pipe (16) and keeps the free end of the 
saturation pipe (16) floating on the surface of the liquid 

fuel.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a saturation device 
for tanks for liquid fuels such as gasoline, petrol and the 
like. It is known that liquid fuel storage tanks, besides 
being buried to avoid flammability, must comply with safety 
rules to avoid the risk of explosion. So-called saturation 
systems are used for this purpose; in these systems, safety 
is achieved by forming a non-explosive mixture inside the 
tank above the liquid fuel. In particular, in the above mentioned safety systems 
the air that lies above the liquid is mixed with such a 
percentage of fuel vapors as to be outside the explosive 
range (which is defined as being 1.1 to 5.4% of fuel). 
Indeed, this percentage can be so high as to take the 
mixture outside the flammability range as well. As shown schematically in figure 1, known saturation 
devices have a saturation tray 1 which is located on the 
bottom of the tank 2 and contains fuel; the saturation tray 
1 is connected to the outside by means of a ventilation pipe 
3. The air drawn in by negative pressure enters the tank 
after bubbling through the fuel contained in the tray so 
that the air becomes saturates. This saturation system entails a negative pressure that 
must be overcome to draw the fuel; this negative pressure is 
proportional to the extent to which the tank is filled. 
Accordingly, the pump connected to the tank must withstand a 
stress that increases in proportion to the increase in the 
level difference H to be overcome. The aim of the present invention is to solve the above  
 
problem by providing a saturation device for liquid fuel 
storage tanks that allows to minimize the negative pressure 
to be overcome in order to draw fuel, making said negative 
pressure independent of the extent to which said tank is 
filled. In particular, said device facilitates the operation 
of the pump, which runs with a minimum effort, thus 
increasing its life and improving all its operating 
conditions (e.g. noise, cavitation, negative pressure, 
etc.). Within the scope of this aim, an object of the present 
invention is to provide a saturation device which is simple 
in concept, safe and reliable in operation and versatile in 
use. With the foregoing and other objects in view, the 
invention provides a saturation device for liquid fuel 
storage tanks, which comprises: a ventilation pipe rigidly 
coupled to the top of the tank and connectable to the 
outside; a saturation pipe which is articulated, at one end, 
to said ventilation pipe so that it floats and has, at its 
opposite

<CLAIMS>
Saturation device for liquid fuel storage tanks, 
characterized in that it comprises: a ventilation pipe 

rigidly coupled to the top of the tank and connectable to 
the outside; a saturation pipe which is articulated, at one 

end, to said ventilation pipe so that it floats and has, at 
its opposite end, a curved tip portion which is suitable to 

ensure its immersion in the liquid fuel contained in said 
tank; and floating means rigidly coupled to said floating 

saturation pipe for keeping the free end of said saturation 
pipe floating on the surface of said liquid fuel. 
Device according to claim 1, characterized in that 
said floating means include a pipe coaxially mounted on the 

outside of said floating saturation pipe and sealingly 
closed at its ends, so as to form an air-filled chamber on 

said saturation pipe. 
Device according to claim 1, characterized in that 
said ventilation pipe is arranged vertically at the top of 

said tank, at a manhole, and is rigidly coupled to a fire-stopping 
saturation element h
aving a flange by means of 
which it is fixed to the lid of said manhole of the tank. 
Device according to claims 3, characterized in that 
said ventilation pipe is rigidly coupled to said fire-stopping 

saturation element by screw means, said screw means 
allowing to adjust angular position and height of said 

ventilation pipe. 
Device according to claim 1, characterized in that 
said floating saturation pipe is articulated to said 

ventilation pipe by means of an elbow joint constituted by 
 

two angular connectors to which a male element and a female 
element are screwed, said male and female elements being 

mutually rotatably connected and having means for limiting 
mutual rotation between said angular connectors. 
Device according to claim 5, characterized in that 
said joint allows said floating saturation pipe to rotate 

between a substantially horizontal position when the tank is 
filled to its maximum level and a position which is inclined 

downwards by 60o when the tank is filled to its minimum 
level. 
Device according to claim 1, characterized in that 
said curved tip portion of said floating saturation pipe is 

suitable to set the level difference to be overcome in order 
to draw fuel from said tank. 
Floating saturation device for liquid fuel tanks, 
comprising one or more of the technical features described 

herein and/or illustrated in the accompanying drawings.
