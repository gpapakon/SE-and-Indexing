<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention concerns a Lactobacillus 
bulgaricus having decreased acid production and/or improved 
aroma and flavor production. The present invention is related also to a food 
composition, specially a mild yoghurt or mild yoghurt like 
products comprising the Lactobacillus bulgaricus according 
to the invention. Yoghurt results from growth association of the two 
lactic acid bacteria, Streptococcus thermophilus and 
Lactobacillus bulgaricus. They grow together in milk where 
they ferment lactose, which is present at about 40-50 g per 
liter, to lactate. The whole fermentation usually takes 3 to 
5 hours at 40°C and lowers pH from neutral to about 4.2. Upon 
storage at 4-12°C for several days, the pH then drops further 
to values below 4.0. Parallel to this increased acidity an 
appearance of bitterness develops and greatly degrades the 
organoleptic quality of the product. It is L. bulgaricus which produces the typical  
 
yoghurt aroma during the fermentation process. Therefore, 
yoghurt missing or having a reduced titer of metabolic active 
L. bulgaricus cells miss the aroma components of the typical 
yoghurt. Thus, such yoghurt (or yoghurt like products) can 
be very neutral, i.e. flat in taste. This problem is 
particularly eminent for the production of mild or very mild 
yoghurt, which as a consequence of the limited growth rate 
of L. bulgaricus tend to loose a lot of their aroma. The number of consumer that prefer the milder yet 
aromatic and flavorful yoghurt seems to increase in recent 
years. Therefore, the control method of the acid production 
on the milk fermentation process and the preventing of the 
post-acidification, which is the pH dropping during the 
storage, were truly desired by yoghurt producers. Up to now, 
several methods or starter strain improvements have been 
suggested to control the acidification and post-acidification 
of yoghurt. Most of them are to reduce the number of the 
active cells in starter culture or to eliminate living cells 
from the finished product by pasteurizing. Alternatively low 
acidifying strains are being used. Patent US-A-4734361 (Murao et al.) describes such 
a Lactobacillus bulgaricus strain (OLL 1074) which has been 
deposited in Japan under the number FERM BP 1041. This variant shows a weak tendency towards 
formation of lactic acid at lower temperatures . By employing this variant, it is possible to 
produce a fermented milk or lactic acid beverage in which 
post-acidification at a lower temperature is reduced. Patent US-5,071,763
