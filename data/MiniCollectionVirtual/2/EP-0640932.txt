<ABSTRACT>
An information recording and/or reproducing apparatus (31) 
which can prohibit an optical head (30) from trying to access 

to a data track which does not exist on the optical 
recording medium (1). The information recording and/or 

reproducing apparatus (31) is used with an optical recording 
medium (1) having a plurality of tracks. The information 

recording and/or reproducing apparatus (31) comprises an 
optical head (30) which irradiates the optical recording 

medium (1) with a light beam and detects reflected light 
from the optical recording medium (1), a means for 

controlling the apparatus so as to read information about 
a number of the tracks of the optical recording medium (1), 

and memorise the information as an initial action. The 
optical head (30) is moved by the driving means within a range 

according to the memorised information.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to an information recording and/or
reproducing apparatus capable of recording information
on an optical recording medium with a light beam, or
reproducing information from an optical recording medium
with a light beam. The invention also relates to an
optical recording medium capable of recording and/or
reproducing information with a light beam.Hitherto, as an information recording medium for
recording and/or reproducing information, there have been
known magnetic recording media capable of recording
and/or reproducing information magnetically (for example,
floppy disks and magnetic cards), and optical recording
media capable of recording and reproducing information
with a light beam.There has been known a disk-like or tape-like medium for
use as an optical recording medium.It is considered that optical cards will be used in many
ways, because of easy productivity, good portability, and 
a good accessibility.Figure 1 is a plan view of a typical conventional optical
recording medium as, for example, disclosed in Japanese
Laid-Open Patent Application JP-A-02-203467.Referring to Figure 1, 1 is an optical card having a
rectangular plane shape, with a plurality of tracking
tracks 2 running parallel to each other. Between each
pair of tracking tracks 2 there is provided data track
3 in which information is recorded with a light beam,
there being a plurality of data tracks 3 running parallel
to each other.The tracking tracks 2 are used for registration of the
position of the recording light beam and/or reproducing
light beam when recording data in the data tracks 3 or
reproducing data recorded in the data track 3.At both ends of the data track 3 there is a track
identifier part 4 (hereinafter called "track ID part 4").
The track ID part 4, contains information that shows a
position of each data track 3 and/or address information
relating to the data track. This information is
previously recorded in the track ID part 4, ie. is
preformatted. Each data track 3 is divided into one or
more minimum recording sectors. Information is recorded in the optical card described
above by scanning a light beam modulated in accordance
with the information on the data track 3 and focused to
a small spot on the card, and making an optically
detectable mark in the recording layer.Any information recorded on the optical card is
reproduced by scanning on the data track a light beam
having a fixed power which is not capable of recording,
and detecting a difference of a quantity of reflected
light or

<CLAIMS>
An apparatus for performing at least one of the
functions of recording information on and reproducing

information from an optical recording medium having a
plurality of tracks, comprising:


an optical head (30) for irradiating the optical
recording medium (1) with a light spot and detecting

reflected light from the optical recording medium (1);
means (36) for moving the light spot to a desired
track; and
means (33) for controlling the apparatus to read
information about the number of tracks on the optical

recording medium (1), and to memorise the information as
an initial action, and then for controlling the moving

means (36) to move the light spot within a range
dependent on the memorised information,
the apparatus being 
characterised in that
 the means
(33) for controlling the apparatus is arranged to compare

a track number to be accessed with the said range, and to
produce an error signal without moving the light spot

towards the track when the track number is not within the said
range.
An apparatus according to claim 1, wherein the
tracks are parallel with each other, and the means (36)

for moving the light spot is arranged to move the optical
head (30) in the direction in which the optical head (30)

crosses the tracks (2). 
An apparatus according to at least one of the

preceding claims, wherein said information is recorded as
optically readable information and said apparatus

includes means for reading said information optically.
A method of performing at least one of the
operations of recording information on and reproducing

information from an optical recording medium provided
with a plurality of data tracks (2) having information

about the number of tracks (2), the method comprising the
steps of:


providing an apparatus effective to perform at least
one of the functions of recording information on and

reproducing information from said information recording
medium,
the apparatus comprising:

a driving means effective to move a light spot to a
desired data track (2),
inserting (101) said information recording medium
(1) into the apparatus;
reproducing the information (step 102) and
memorising (step 103) the range of accessible tracks (2)

on the information recording medium (1) according to the
information on the tracks (2);
comparing (step 201) a track address which is
indicated by an input signal to the apparatus to be

within the range (step 205);
moving the light spot to a data track (2) having the 
track address when the track address is within the range

to record information; and
sending out an error signal (step 205) without
moving the light spot when the track address is not

within the range.
