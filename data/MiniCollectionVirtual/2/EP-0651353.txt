<ABSTRACT>
A data processing system for a picture coding, includes a data 
memory for storing a DCT coefficient data successively transferred one 

after another, a flipflop set prior to the successive transfer of the DCT 
coefficient data, and a non-zero detector for detecting a non-zero data 

when the DCT coefficient data is successively transferred. When the 
non-zero data is detected, the non-zero detector resets the flipflop. When 

the successive transfer of the DCT coefficient data has been completed, 
An entropy coding CPU discriminates on the basis of the condition of the 

flipflop whether or not all of the data stored in the data memory is zero, 
so that if the condition of the flipflop indicates that all of the data stored 

in the data memory is zero, the entropy coding CPU does not read the 
data memory.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a data processing system, and more
specifically to a data input processing for a picture coding processing in a
data processing system.A high performance picture coding processing (data compression of
picture information) is being standardized in a plurality of organizations
so as to ensure compatibility of compressed data in various applications.
In a field of communication, the CCITT (International Telegraph and
Telephone Consultative Committee) recommendations H.261 and an
MPEG (Moving Picture Coding Experts Group) format in the ISO
(International Organization of Standardization) for a package system (for
example, CD-ROM (compact disc read only memory)), are important in
standardizing a moving picture coding.A picture coding processing, which is now being standardized, is
realized by a combination of a plurality of unitary processing algorithms
as shown in Figure 1. In the shown processing, a main processing is
constituted of a movement prediction processing 101, a frame difference
processing 102, a DCT (discrete cosine transform) processing 103, a 
quantization processing 104, a zigzag scanning and zero detection 105,
and an entropy coding processing 106. In addition, to complex the
predicted picture at the coding side, a reverse-quantization processing
107, a reverse-DCT processing 108 and a frame accelerating processing
109 are performed. The result thus obtained is stored in a frame memory
110, which is fed back to a succeeding prediction processing 101.Most of the above mentioned processings are executed for each one
of regions obtained by dividing a whole of the picture into a meshed
form. These processings include a processing performed in units of 8×8
pixel region (called a "block") (for example, DCT processing 103) and
another processing performed in units of 16×16 pixel region (called a
"macro-block") (for example, movement prediction processing 101). In
this connection, it is defined that, in a macro-block layer, a brightness
signal Y is composed of information of 16×16 pixels, and color
difference signals Cb and Cr are treated as information of 8×8 pixels
obtained by thinning out in a vertical direction into a half. Therefore, the
macro-block includes four blocks of brightness signals and one block for
each of two color difference signals, and accordingly, have information of
six blocks in total.Of the coding processing, only a portion to which the present
invention is directed, will be further described in detail. The zigzag scan
and zero detection
