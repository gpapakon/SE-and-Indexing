<ABSTRACT>
For manufacturing an active brazing paste, which is suitable for brazing conductor leads into insulating materials, for example ceramic components, and which contains an active brazing powder and an organic material as vehicle, coarse pieces of the active brazing alloy are prehydrogenated. These are ground in a mill with addition of hydrogen to give a hydrogenated active brazing powder. The latter is then processed with the liquid vehicle open under normal atmospheric and temperature conditions to give the active brazing paste.

<CLAIMS>
A method of producing an active brazing paste containing 
an active brazing powder and an organic material acting 

as a vehicle, said method comprising the steps of 

prehydrogenating coarse pieces of a selected 
active brazing alloy, 
grinding said prehydrogenated pieces in a mill 
with the addition of hydrogen to obtain a hydrogenated 

active brazing powder, and 
processing the hydrogenated active brazing 
powder with the liquid vehicle openly, under 

normal atmospheric and temperature conditions, 
to form the active brazing paste.
