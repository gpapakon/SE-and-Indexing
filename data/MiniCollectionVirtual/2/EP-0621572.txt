<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a method for recording an 
incident, in particular a traffic offence, by electronically 

making at least one picture record of this incident and 
electronically storing the record, wherein at least two 

picture records are made simultaneously from different 
angles of view. 
The electronic image data of the two picture 
records are therein entered into a single collective data 

file and this data file is encrypted and then stored. 
The invention further relates to a device for performing 
this method provided with means for making a picture 

record in electronic manner, with electronic storage means, 
with programmable input means and with encrypting means. 
The electronic image recording means can be adapted 
to make at least two records simultaneously from different 

angles of view.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a method for recording an 
incident, in particular a traffic offence, by making at 
least one picture record of this incident and storing the 
record. Such methods are generally applied for automatically 
recording traffic infractions, such as driving through 
a red light or exceeding the maximum speed limit. In the 
known methods the infraction is recorded, whereafter a 
camera, optionally together with a flash device, is activated 
and the offender is thus photographed. In order for it 
to function as valid testimony in the case against the 
offender, at least the licence plate of the offending vehicle 
and the vehicle type must be unambiguously distinguishable 
in the picture record, while the record must further 
provide a clear picture of the overall traffic situation at 
the time of the observed offence. In the known methods use 
was always made for this purpose of a photo or film camera 
with which very sharp records can be made from which the 
required information can easily be obtained. A drawback to the known methods however is that 
only a comparatively limited number of records can be made 
with a photo or film camera before the film is used up and 
has to be replaced, while such photographic records moreover 
do not lend themselves well to automatic processing, whereby 
this method is labour-intensive and costly. The invention therefore has for its object to provide 
a method for recording a traffic offence wherein these 
drawbacks do not occur. This is achieved according to the 
invention in that the making of the picture record and the 
storing thereof take place electronically. By making electronic 
records use can be made for storing the records of 
the currently available mass storage means of electromagnetic 
or opto-electronic type, such as a so-called hard disk 
or optical disk. A considerably larger number of offences 
can hereby be recorded than in the known methods before  
 
replacement of the storage medium is necessary. The electronically 
captured records can also be transmitted in simple 
manner, for instance via telephone lines or through the air, 
and such records lend themselves well to further automated 
electronic processing. At least two picture records are preferably made 
at substantially the same time from different angles of 
view. Thus, despite the often relatively limited resolution 
of electronic image recording means, the data required for 
legal use of the records can nevertheless be recorded. One 
picture record can herein be made of
