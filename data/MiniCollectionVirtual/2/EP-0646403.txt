<ABSTRACT>
Apparatus and process for removing caprolactam emissions from 
a broad variety of sources, especially from caprolactam 

polymerization operations and thermoplastic polycaprolactam 
processing operations which contains a header for collecting air 

containing the emissions, a duct, and a candle filter housing (20), 
which is connected to the header by the duct, a candle filter (22) 

located in the candle filter housing, which is connected to the 
duct, a nozzle for rinsing the candle filter with an aqueous 

caprolactam solution, which is connected to the candle filter (22); 
a reservoir having a drain which is connected to the candle filter, 

a circulation pump for recirculating the aqueous caprolactam 
solution from the reservoir to the candle filter (22), a refractometer 

and a feedback equipment for maintaining the caprolactam 
concentration in the reservoir at a predetermined level and a 

fan for moving the air through the header, duct, candle filter (22) and 
candle filter housing (20).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates generally to an apparatus for 
removing emissions from caprolactam polymerization operations and 
thermoplastic polycaprolactam processing operations. More 
specifically, it relates to an apparatus for removing emissions 
before, during and after the polymerization reaction for the 
manufacture of polycaprolactam and during thermoplastic 
polycaprolactam processing operations like extrusion, injection 
molding, fiber spinning operations, blow molding, and film blowing. During the manufacture of polycaprolactam and polycaprolactam 
articles, recycling of polycaprolactam articles and cleaning 
operations of reactors and processing machinery, caprolactam 
emissions may be released to the environment, which is not 
desirable. For example, before, during and after the 
polymerization of epsilon-caprolactam, hereinafter referred to as 
caprolactam, monomer vapors may be released in the environment from 
transportation tanks, storage tanks, pipelines, ducts, 
polymerization reactors, polymer melts, polymer strands, water 
bath, cutters, dryers and the like. During thermoplastic 
polycaprolactam processing like injection molding or extrusion, the 
thermoplastic polymers are for example extruded through an extruder 
into strands for chip production or into films, fibers, profiles, 
tubes and the like. During the extrusion at a temperature of from 
about 180 to about 350Â°C, monomer or oligomer caprolactam vapors, 
compounds formed by thermal evaporation, thermal decomposition, or 
vapors of additives are released from the surface of the extruded 
polymers, which are leaving the nozzle of the extruder. These 
vapors evaporate immediately into an aerosol that would form  
 
deposits in the neighborhood of the extruder and therefore must be 
removed, which is usually done by the quench air removal. The 
exhaust air is usually released into the environment, which is not 
desirable. A filament quenching apparatus is known from U.S.-A-3,619,452 
which comprises a quenching chamber and a gas entry 
chamber. The quench air exits the quenching apparatus without 
further treatment. U.S.-A-4,676, 807 discloses a process for removal of liquid 
aerosols from gaseous streams by passing the stream through a 
coalescing filter. In the examples oil and water aerosols were 
tested. U.S.-A-4,759,782 which is a C.I.P. of an application which 
issued as U.S.-A-4,676,807 described above, discloses the 
coalescing filter for removal of liquid aerosols from gaseous 
streams. U. S.-A-4,464,266 discloses a
