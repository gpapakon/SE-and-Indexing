<CLAIMS>
Method for lowering the content of nitrates
stored in a plant, characterized in that an

overexpression of nitrate reductase is induced in the
plant.
Method according to Claim 1, characterized in
that it is used to enhance the earliness of the plant.
Method according to either of Claims 1 and 2,
characterized in that a foreign gene coding for nitrate

reductase is introduced into the genome of the plant
under conditions permitting its expression.
Method according to one of Claims 1 to 3,
characterized in that the gene coding for nitrate

reductase originates from a cDNA of dicotyledonous plants
coding for nitrate reductase.
Method according to one of Claims 2 to 4,
characterized in that explants are infected with an


Agrobacterium tumefaciens
 or 
Agrobacterium Rhizogenes

strain transformed with a plasmid into which is inserted
the said foreign gene coding for nitrate reductase,

placed under the control of elements providing for the
expression of the said gene.
Method according to one of Claims 2 to 5, characterized
in that the foreign gene coding for nitrate

reductase is inserted into a plasmid derived from the Ti
or Ri plasmid.
Method according to one of Claims 2 to 6, characterized
in that the foreign gene coding f
or nitrate
reductase is placed under the control of a heterologous

promoter which is functional in the transformed plant.
Method according to one of Claims 2 to 7, characterized 
in that the foreign gene coding for nitrate

reductase is derived from the Nia 2 gene for nitrate
reductase of tobacco.
Method according to one of Claims 2 to 7, characterized
in that the foreign gene coding for nitrate

reductase is placed under the control of the 35S RNA
promoter of Ca MV.
Method according to one of Claims 2 to 9, characterized
in that the foreign gene coding for nitrate

reductase is inserted into plasmid pBin19.
