<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a cyanate
resin composition, a cyanate compound and a copper-clad
laminate produced using the same.Almost all substrates for printed circuit
boards are made from adducts of bismaleimide
compounds and amine compounds or a combination of
bisphenol epoxy resins and dicyandiamide, which are
thermosetting resin compositions for electric and
electronic uses. The circuit boards are being
directed to multiple layered ones. A requirement
for resins to be used is that they have dielectric
constant as low as possible in order mainly to
improve signal propagation speed. One of conventional
ways to this effect is addition of thermoplastic
resins having low dielectric constant to thermosetting
resins. However, this method has such
disadvantage that heat resistance of the thermosetting
resins is damaged. Demand for practically usable
resins having low dielectric constant has not yet
been sufficiently satisfied.Under the circumstances, cyanate resins
have been developed (e.g. DE-A-2533122
and WO-A-88/05443). Cyanates
which are familiar at present include dicyanates of
bisphenol A. Although these cyanates have relatively
low dielectric constant, recent high advance of
computer techniques requires materials having
lower dielectric constant. It is the object of the present invention to
provide a cyanate
resin composition from which a copper-clad laminate
having dielectric constant low enough and
practically acceptable heat resistance without
damaging properties of conventional copper-clad
laminates can be produced. A further object of the present
invention is to provide a copper-clad laminate using said
cyanate resin composition.That is, the present invention relates to
the following cyanate resin compositions (1) - (2), the
cyanate compound (3) and copper-clad laminates (4) using the same.
(1) A cyanate resin composition comprising
(A) and (B) as essential components:
(A) a cyanate compound represented by the
following formula (1):

wherein R and Q each represents a halogen atom, an
alkyl group of 1-10 carbon atoms, a cycloalkyl
group of 5-7 carbon atoms or a hydrocarbon group of
6-20 carbon atoms which contains a cycloalkyl group
of 5-7 carbon atoms, i and j each represents an
integer of 0-4 with a proviso that, when i and j
represent 2 or more, R and Q may be identical or 
different and M represents a group shown by the
following formula (2):

wherein T represents a halogen atom, an alkyl
group of 1-10 carbon atoms, a cycloalkyl group of
5-7 carbon atoms or a hydrocarbon group of 6-20
