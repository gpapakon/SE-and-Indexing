<ABSTRACT>
Oligomeric formal diols are prepared by coupling segments of poly(tetramethylene ether) glycols, each having a molecular weight of 650-3000, with formaldehyde in the presence of a granular acidic catalyst, to yield poly(tetramethylene ether) formal glycols of 1,400-12,000 molecular weight. Oligomeric formal diols of a second type can also be prepared by coupling with formaldehyde segments of poly(tetramethylene ether) glycols mixed with segments of other polymeric glycols, as for example polyethylene oxide glycol of 200 molecular weight, to yield poly(ether formal) glycols of substantially higher molecular weight than either of the starting polyether glycols, and having properties significantly different from the parent polyether glycols that may affect the performance as soft or elastomeric segments of derived polyurethanes, polyetheresters, and polyureas. Yet a third type of oligomeric formal diols can be prepared by coupling monomeric diols, as for example 1,4-butanediol, with formaldehyde to yield higher molecular weight poly(oxybutylene formal) glycols.

<DESCRIPTION>
 TitlePreparation and Purification ofPoly(Tetramethylene Ether) Formal Glycols and Poly(Oxybutylene Formal) Glycols Background of the inventionField of the Invention This invention relates to the field of preparing poly(ether formal) glycols, and more specifically relates to synthesis of block poly(tetramethylene ether formal) glycols, block hybrid poly(ether formal) glycols, and oligomeric formal glycols from paraformaldehyde and, respectively, poly(tetramethylene ether) glycols, mixtures of poly(tetramethylene ether) glycols with polyethylene oxide glycols and/or polypropylene oxide glycols including substituted polyethylen oxide glycols, or alpha-omega diols such as monomeric 1,4-butanediol.Description of the Related Art Poly(tetramethylene ether) glycols, herein abbreviated as PTMEG, are commercially available and widely used as polyols along with a polyisocyanate and a chain extender in high performance polyurethanes. They are also used in polyetheresters and polyureas. PTMEG acts as an elastomeric soft segment in these products, while the chain extender and polyisocyanate or polyester contribute crystalline hard blocks to the final polymer structure. Several molecular weight ranges of PTMEG are made to cover a variety of end uses: Mn 650, 1000, 2000, and 2900 are typical. Molecular weights above 2000 cause the PTMEG to be difficult to handle because of its high viscosity. Further, even at 650 molecular weight, PTMEG is a borderline solid while higher molecular weights must be melted before use in most applications.One approach to provide a lower melting modified PTMEG is to couple segments of the PTMEG with formaldehyde to break up the regular polyether structure as illustrated:H[0(CH2)4]nOH+ CH20 + HO[(CH2)4θ]nH --- > H[0(CH2)4]nOCH20[(CH2)4θ]nH + H20Also, 3 moles of PTMEG + 2 moles of formaldehyde should yieldH[0(CH2)4]nOCH2Of(CH2)40]nCH20[(CH2)40]nII + 2H20.These block PTMEG formal glycols, block hybrid poly(ether formal) glycols, and oligomeric formal glycols are characterized by lower crystalline melting points and lower viscosities than the corresponding PTMEG of similar molecular weight indicating a more random arrangement of the backbone 

 structure of the glycols, and thus making these products easier to handle in their manufacture, shipping, storage, and processing in further reactions.Also included is a polymer of the formula:H[0(CH2)4]a(OCH2)b[0(CH2)4]a(OCH2)b[0(CH2)4]aOH, where the "a" components are derived from poly(tetramethylene ether) glycols of 650-3,000 Mn and "b" components
