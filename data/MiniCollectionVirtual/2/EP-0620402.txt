<ABSTRACT>
A gas turbine combustor (6) having a pre-mixing (10) zone 
and a combustion zone (12) separated by a barrier plate (57). A 

plurality of concentrically arranged annular passages, into 
which lean mixtures of fuel and air are introduced, are 

disposed in the pre-mixing zone (10). Each of the annular 
passages (23-26) has a discharge end (35) in which a plurality of 

swirlers (59) are circumferentially arranged that allow fuel/air 
mixtures flowing through the annular passages (23-26) to enter the 

combustion zone (12), the swirlers (59) acting as flame holders. A 
toroidal fuel manifold (70-73) upstream of each of the annular 

passages (23-26) allows the fuel/air ratio in each annular passage 
(23-26) to be individually controlled. The firing temperature of 

the combustor (6) is increased by sequentially supplying fuel 
to each annular passage (23-26) in turn, with the innermost 

passages (23) being supplied with fuel first. A pilot fuel 
assembly is centrally disposed with respect to the annular 

passages and has swirler vanes and an ignitor.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a combustor for 
burning fuel in compressed air. More specifically, the 
present invention relates to a combustor for a gas turbine 
that significantly reduces the amount of NOx produced by 
combustion. In a gas turbine, fuel is burned in compressed 
air, produced by a compressor, in one or more combustors. 
Traditionally, such combustors had a primary combustion 
zone in which an approximately stoichiometric mixture of 
fuel and air was formed and burned in a diffusion type 
combustion process. Additional air was introduced into the 
combustor downstream of the primary combustion zone. 
Although the overall fuel/air ratio was considerably less 
than stoichiometric, the fuel/air mixture was readily 
ignited at start-up and good flame stability was achieved 
over a wide range in firing temperatures due to the locally 
richer nature of the fuel/air mixture in the primary 
combustion zone. Unfortunately, use of such approximately 
stoichiometric fuel/air mixtures resulted in very high 
temperatures in the primary combustion zone. Such high 
temperatures promoted the formation of oxides of nitrogen 
("NOx"), considered an atmospheric pollutant. Although it 
is known that combustion at lean fuel/air ratios reduces 
NOx formation, such lean mixtures are difficult to ignite 
and exhibit poor flame stability.  
 It is therefore desirable to provide a combustor 
capable of stable combustion with very lean mixtures of 
fuel and air, so a to reduce the formation of NOx, as well 
as one that permits reliable ignition at start-up. Accordingly, it is the general object of the current 
invention to provide a combustor capable of stable 
combustion with very lean mixtures of fuel and air, so as 
to reduce the formation of NOx, as well as one that permits 
reliable ignition at start-up. The invention consists in a gas turbine, comprising: 
a) a compressor for compressing air; b) a combustor for producing a hot gas by burning a 
fuel in said compressed air, said combustor having: 
(i) a plurality of annular passages concentrically 
arranged around a common axis, each of said passages having 
an inlet end and a discharge end; (ii) an approximately toroidal manifold for each of 
said annular passages, (iii) means for separately controlling the introduction 
of fuel into each of said annular passages via its 
toroidal manifold; c) a turbine for expanding said hot gas produced by 
said combustor;  
and characterised by 
each of said toroidal manifolds 
being disposed immediately upstream of
