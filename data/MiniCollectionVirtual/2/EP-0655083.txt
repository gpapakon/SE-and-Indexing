<ABSTRACT>
A plasma arc torch is used as an independent heat source in an enclosed reactor vessel to gasify municipal solid waste and produce a medium quality gas and an inert monolithic slag having substantially lower toxic element leachability. The gas has lower levels of metals and semi-volatile organic compounds, particularly dioxins and furans. Other materials may also be gasified, for example, coal, wood and peat.

<DESCRIPTION>
This is a continuation-in-part application of
Application Serial No. 868,024 filed April 13, 1992, and
cross-referenced below.The present invention is related to co-pending
application S.N. 868,024, filed April 13, 1992, and
entitled PLASMA TORCH FURNACE PROCESSING OF SPENT
POTLINER FROM ALUMINUM SMELTERS by George W. Carter,
George W. Morgenthaler and Jeffrey L. Struthers, which
application is incorporated herein by reference.The present invention relates to methods for disposal of
wastes in general, and in particular to a method for
gasification of municipal solid waste by means of a
plasma arc torch in an enclosed, refractory lined,
reactor vessel. The daily generation of solid wastes is a fact of life
in industrialized society and their disposal is becoming
an ever-increasing problem. The more common of
these waste materials is Municipal Solid Waste (MSW).
Disposal of MSW through landfill is becoming
increasingly less attractive and more difficult as sites
are becoming full, alternate sites are becoming scarce
and the knowledge and reality of contamination of
groundwater, adjacent facilities and property are
becoming more prevalent and disconcerting. In the
search for more efficient and less costly disposal,
Energy From Waste (EFW) technologies are being developed
which also create energy as a byproduct of the
destruction process. The most widely known type of EFW
facility is incineration in various forms; however,
incinerator EFW system require extensive air pollution
control systems to reduce emissions below regulatory
levels and they also produce toxic flyashes. EFW
systems based on the gasification process have more
inherent promise for lower emission of all environmental
contaminants through both a cleaner and a lower volume
of product gas, and a cleaner solid residue. Several United States patents relating to processing of waste are
known. They are:

EP-A-0290974
and US-A-5222448.The present invention provides a continuous process for gasification
of municipal solid waste (MSW) and other carbon based solids, comprising

<CLAIMS>
A continuous process for gasification of municipal solid waste
(MSW) and other carbon based solids, comprising the steps of:


(i) igniting a plasma arc torch and creating a vertical heating
zone inside a refractory lined, tubular, reactor vessel;
(ii) preheating said reactor vessel walls to at least substantially
1100 degrees celsius;
(iii) minimizing air content of said MSW by compression, or by
application of vacuum, prior to feeding said

MSW into said reactor vessel; and
(iv) substantially continuously feeding said MSW directly into said
vertical heating zone in said reactor vessel from one side of the

vertical heating zone, while minimizing entry of air.
A process as claimed in claim 1, characterized in that said MSW
remains in said vertical heating zone to cause moisture in said MSW to

react with the carbon and to substantially remove carbon from said MSW.
A process as claimed in claim 2, characterized in that said MSW is
fed into said reactor vessel by means of a horizontal hydraulic feeder.
A process as claimed in claims 2 or 3, characterized in that product
gas is extracted from an opposite side to that wherethrough said MSW is

fed. 
A process as claimed in claim 4, characterized by pyrolyzing said
MSW into gas and monolithic liquid slag.
A process as claimed in claim 5, characterized in that said gas is
exhausted from gas reactor vessel by means of a cyclone.
A process as claimed in claim 6, characterized in that said monolithic
liquid slag is a silicate mass encapsulating metals in said MSW.
