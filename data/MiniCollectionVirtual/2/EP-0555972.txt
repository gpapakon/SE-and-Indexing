<ABSTRACT>
An irreversible tamper evident system is provided by a 
color change system (32) carried by the flexible button 

portion (24) of the closure (10). A color change system (32) 
comprises an indicator coating (36) over a dark colored 

substrate coating (34). The indicator coat (36) is suitably 
colored with a light colored transparent colorant such as an 

orange colored fluorescent dry. The indicator coat (36) is 
also preferably a liquid material which can be cured by 

evaporation, heat, UV irradiation or the like, to form a solid 
layer. When the substrate layer (34) and indicator layer (36) 

are in intimate contact, a first color is observed. Depending 
upon the relative colors used for this substrate and indicator 

layers (34, 36) this first color can be a combination of the 
colors of the two layers (34, 36) or can be primarily the 

color of the substrate layer (34). However, when the layers 
(34, 36) become separated and the indicator or outer layer 

(36) is spaced from the substrate inner layer (34) a second 
color is observed. The second color is primarily the color of 

the indicator coat (36).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention generally relates to
closures having end panels of which at
least an area is formed to flex when the closure is applied to a
container and, more particularly, to a closure wherein the
flexible area of the end panel is provided with an irreversible
tamper indicating system which is actuated when the flexible area
of the end panel flexes from a sealed condition to an unsealed
condition.Among the various closures made for the food and
beverage industry is a "button" or "pop top" closure wherein the
closure contains a flexible portion which assumes a given flexed
position to indicate a sealed package and a different position
when the package seal is breached. These "button" or "pop top"
closures are commonly used in vacuum sealed food products such as
baby food products to warn purchasers when the vacuum condition
under which the food was packaged has been breached.Although closures having tamper indicating buttons are
predominantly in use in vacuum applications, there also have been 
more recently developed closures with buttons which are
mechanically actuated so as to move from an as formed "down"
position to an upwardly projecting "up" position when the closure
is properly applied to a container. In this "up" position the
closures are further characterized as having energy stored within
the closure end panels urging the buttons to their as formed
"down" position. Removal of these closures from the containers
associated therewith results in the buttons moving to their as
formed "down" position due to the release of the energy stored
within the end panels.Closures having end panels incorporating tamper
indicating buttons are used extensively for the food industry,
especially for vacuum packaged product, because they are
effective quick-detection means that lets one know some very
important conditions about the container. Typically in vacuum
applications, when the container is properly sealed and a vacuum
exists therein, the button is in a "down" position while when the
container has been opened and the closure reapplied, or the
vacuum within the container otherwise lost, the button will be in
its "up" position. Additionally, in vacuum package applications,
when the closure is first opened and the vacuum is lost, a
hissing sound may be heard.Through the extensive commercial use of such button
closures, the purchasing public has become generally aware that
if the deflectable section of the button is up then the original
seal has been broken and that the container should be rejected.

<CLAIMS>
A container including a container body and a
removable closure (10) sealingly applied to said

container body, said closure (10) including a flexible
end panel portion (12) having formed therein a sealing

state indicating area (24) which can flex from a seal
indicating position to a non-seal indicating position

due to the release of energy stored within said end
panel (12), said sealing state indicating area (24)

carrying an irreversible tamper indicating color change
system (32) comprising an effectively dark coloured

base layer (52), and a translucent light coloured
indicator layer (54),

   characterised in that the container includes a photo
degradable bonding/release layer (56) interposed

between said base layer (52) and said indicator layer
(54), said photo degradable bonding/release layer having been

partially degraded after application so as to weaken
the attachment of said bonding/release layer to said

base layer and said indicator layer,

   whereby when said flexible end panel (12) is in a
seal indicating position said degradable

bonding/release layer maintains said base layer (52)
and said indicator layer (54) in effective intimate

contact with each other so that when viewed through
said indicator layer (54) said color change system has

an effective first color, and when said flexible end
panel (12) flexes to its non-seal indicating position,

said bonding/release layer is broken such that said 
indicator layer (54) separates from said base layer

(52) and said color change system when viewed through
said indicator layer (54) has a second color different

from said first color.
A container according to claim 1 wherein said
bonding/release layer is a photodegradable polymer.
A container according to claim 2 wherein said
photodegradable polymer is a photodegradable

polystyrene.
A container according to any preceding claim
wherein said indicator layer (54) comprises a coloured

translucent plastic disc.
A container according to any preceding claim
wherein said color change system (32) further comprises

a transparent overcoat (62) which prevents said
indicator layer (54) from falling off said closure when

said indicator layer (54) separates from said base
layer (52).
A container according to claim 5 wherein said color
change system (32) further comprises means between said

indicator layer (54) and said overcoat (62) to inhibit
bonding between said indicator layer (54) and said 

overcoat (62).
A container according to claim 6 wherein said means
comprising a surfactant.
A container according to any preceding claim
further comprising means for creating a stress center

to facilitate separation of said indicator layer (54)
from said base layer (52) when said flexible end panel

flexes to its non-seal indicating position.
