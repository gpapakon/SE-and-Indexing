<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a flexible connector assembly
fastened to rigid lengths of tubing for use in an automotive air
conditioning system. The connector can withstand vibration and
movement with minimal effusion or leakage of fluid from or ingression
of moisture into the system and without creating excessive levels of
fluid dynamic noise.Flexible connectors are known in the art. Examples of various
connectors can be found in U.S. Patent Nos. 2,010,546; 2,273,395;
2,657,076; 2,836,436; 3,528,260; 3,788,394; 4,408,467;
4,480,857; 4,793,150 and 5,048,873.In a typical automobile air conditioning system presently in use,
refrigerant is conveyed by flexible hoses and rigid tubing to the
compressor, the condenser and the evaporator. The flexible hoses
and rigid tubing accommodate the vibration and movement existing
between the vehicle frame, upon which the condenser and evaporator
are rigidly affixed, and the vehicle engine upon which the compressor
is rigidly affixed. Refrigerant utilized in automobile air conditioning systems has
historically been a chloroflourocarbon (CFC). More recently,
hydroflourocarbon (HFC) refrigerant has been adopted and is expected
to replace CFC refrigerant as the dominant refrigerant used in such
systems. HFC refrigerant is extremely expensive, much more
expensive than CFC refrigerant. However, with progressive taxation
recently placed on CFC refrigerant, its cost will similarly rise.
Further, CFC refrigerants have been found to be detrimental to the
environment if released into the atmosphere. Accordingly, it is
important that air conditioning systems used in vehicles be designed
to prevent, to the greatest degree possible, any escape of CFC and
HFC refrigerants into the atmosphere. The challenge to develop such
a system has intensified because flexible hose assemblies presently
used to convey refrigerant through the system often permit refrigerant
loss by effusion through the hose wall and end fitting connection
sites.Flexible hoses presently used in air conditioning systems permit
variable levels of moisture ingression which over time greatly reduces
the efficiency of the system. Flexible hoses are also subject to
twisting during installation, which not only causes premature wear,
but also places undesirable stresses and potential failure and leakage
at the fittings fastening such hoses to system elements. In contrast,
rigid lengths of tubing formed of any one of a wide variety of
materials are capable of transporting refrigerant throughout the air
conditioning system

encircling and slidably engaged to said outer surface
(54;56) of said link wall (52) and in contact with

said cylindrical inner surface (38) of said collar
wall (34) adjacent said opening (40;42) defined by

said collar wall, and said gasket means including at
least one annular gasket (86) sealingly engaged to

both said cylindrical inner surface (38) of said
collar wall (34) and said spherically-shaped outer

surface (54;56) of said link wall and positioned
between said first (64) and second (72) bearings.

characterised in that within each collar said bearing

means and gasket means includes one first bearing (64)
positioned between two second bearings (72) with a

pair of annular gaskets (86) positioned between said
first bearing and each of said second bearings.
The flexible connector assembly of claim 1,
characterised in that within each collar said bearing

means and gasket means includes two sets of first 
bearings (64) and second bearings (72) with a pair of

annular gaskets (86) positioned between said first
bearing and said second bearing of each set.
