<ABSTRACT>
In order to place web offset printing presses A and B 
in a synchronous operation condition by simple operation 

with a reduce burden to the operator, actuation of a drive 
clutch and a folder clutch of the machine A alone and 

actuation of a drive clutch of the machine B along are made 
detectable on a synchronous operation control panel and, 

under control of the control panel, a synchronous operation 
clutch is actuated with phase matching between the machines 

A and B, thereby enabling synchronous operation.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a method
for matching the rotational phases of plate cylinders
of individual printing presses, for example, when two
web offset printing presses are operated in parallel and
in synchronization.Heretofore, a web offset printing press, as shown in
Fig.4, comprises a splicer infeed 1 for web feed and tension
adjustment, for example, a 4-stage printing unit 2
for monoor multicolor printing, a dryer 4, and a cooling
drag 5 for cooling. The machine shown in Fig.4 further
comprises first and second 2-stage folders, and the
splicer infeed 1, the printing unit 2, the cooling drag 5,
and the first and second folders 6 are driven by a motor
3.In this printing press, a line shaft between the printing
unit 2 and the dryer 4 is provided with a drive clutch
7, and the first and second folders 6 are also provided
with folder clutches 7F. The drive clutch 7 is adjust starting
under slow rotation, and the folder clutch 7F is
adjust timing for phase matching between the printing
unit 2 and the plate cylinder.Timing of the folder clutch 7F is matched as follows.
Since the plate cylinder makes one turn for two turns of
a drive shaft of the motor 3, after tuning on the drive
clutch 7, the folder clutch 7F is actuated in response to
a pulse output from a detector 8 such as a limit switch
for detecting two turns of the drive shaft by a pulse.
Since there are two states (180° rotation or 360° rotation)
in the rotational position of the plate cylinder, the
folder 6 is set when it is actuated so that the folder clutch
7F is not actuated with a phase difference of half turn of
the plate cylinder.In practice, pulse output of the detector 8 of the
drive clutch 7 and pulse output of the detector 8F of the
folder clutch 7F are displayed on lamps on a control
panel to detect a condition where the lamps simultaneously
light.A plurality of printing presses, for example, two of
such a web offset printing press are disposed in parallel
and operated in synchronization, and a printed matter is
conducted to the folder of one printing press, thereby
achieving a parallel synchronous operation method.That is, one web offset printing press (hereinafter
referred to as "machine A") as a main machine and the
other web offset printing press (hereinafter referred to
as "machine B") as a sub-machine are linked by a new
line shaft and a clutch, specifically, the individual cooling
drags 5 of the machine A and the machine B are connected
with a line shaft and a clutch for synchronous
operation to synchronize the machines A and B
</DESCRIPTION>
<CLAIMS>
A parallel synchronous operation method of two web offset
printing presses A, B each having a folder, in which

printing and folding can be performed by the web offset
printing presses A, B, respectively, during an ordinary

printing process, and prints prepared by the web offset
printing presses A, B can be folded by the folder of

the web offset printing press A, comprising the steps of:

actuating a first clutch (7A) connecting a first drive
system of the web offset printing press A while matching a

timing;
then actuating a second clutch (7B) connecting a second
drive system of the web offset printing press B;
then operating the web offset printing press B at a slow
rotation by operation on a, synchronous operation control

panel, and when a second synchronous operation clutch (10Z) is
actuated, automatically stopping the web offset printing

press B;
then operating the web offset printing press A at a slow
rotation by operation on a synchronous operation control

panel, and, at an ON timing position of a first synchronous
operation clutch (10Y), automatically stopping the web

offset printing press A; and
then operating only the web offset printing press B at a

slow rotation, and detecting the ON timing position of the first
synchronous operation clutch (10Y) to actuate the first

synchronous operation clutch (10Y).
The parallel synchronous operation method of two web offset
printing presses A, B of claim 1, wherein a clutch lamp is

blinked on actuation of the second clutch (10Z) of the synchronous
operation clutches, and the clutch lamp is continuously lit

on actuation of the first clutch (10Y) of the synchronous
operation clutches.
