<DESCRIPTION>
This application is a continuation-in-part of application Serial Number
932,176, filed August 19, 1992.The gamma-aminobutyric acid-A receptor (GABA-A receptor) is the most
abundant inhibitory receptor in mammalian brain. It is comprised of a
heteropolymeric structure that forms a chloride ion channel, and bears multiple
recognition sites for the binding of modulatory molecules. The binding of GABA
to its specific recognition site on the GABA-A receptor opens the ion channel
and allows chloride ions to flow into the nerve cell. This action hyperpolarizes
the cell membrane of that neuron and thereby makes the cell less reactive to
excitatory stimuli. The chloride ion current may also be regulated by various
drugs that serve as positive or negative modulators of the GABA-A receptor
(Puia, G. et al. Molecular Pharm. 1991, 39, 691). The so-called benzo -
diazepine (BZD) receptor is a site for such allosteric modulators on the GABA-A
receptor. This site mediates two opposing effects, one that amplifies the action
of GABA ("positive" efficacy) and the other that reduces the action of GABA
("negative" efficacy). Agents facilitating GABA-receptor/chloride ion-channel
functions via the BZD site are referred to as agonists, while agents reducing
such function are referred to as inverse agonists. Antagonists at this site block
the effects of agonists or inverse agonists by competitively inhibiting their
binding. It is thus possible to have a series of compounds in which members
equally bind to the BZD site but have equal and opposite regulatory effects on
the GABA-A receptor/chloride ion channel. Also, within the series a continuum
of activity is possible (Takada, S. et al. J. Med. Chem. 1988, 31, 1738). Thus,
BZD receptor ligands can induce a wide spectrum of pharmacological effects
ranging from muscle relaxant, hypnotic, sedative, anxiolytic, and anticonvulsant
activities, produced by full or partial agonists ("positive"), to the proconvulsant,
anti-inebriant, and anxiogenic activities, produced by inverse agonists
("negative"). (A further understanding of this area can be gleaned from: Mohler, 
H. Arzneim.-Forsch./Drug Res.1992. 42 (2a). 211; Haefely, W. et al., Advances
in Drug Research, Academic Press, vol. 14, 1985, pp. 165-322; Skolnick, P. et
al., GABA and Benzodiazepine Receptors, Squires, R., Ed., 1987, pp. 99-102
and references cited therein.)The benzodiazepines are a class of compounds which bind to the BZD
receptor with high affinity. Most of the drugs in use are agonist-type ligands for
the receptor.
