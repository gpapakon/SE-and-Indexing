<ABSTRACT>
A package for a high power semiconductor laser 
comprising a hermetically sealed container filled with a 

dry gaseous medium containing oxygen. The package also may 
include a getter for organic impurities, e.g., a getter 

composed of a porous silica or a zeolite. The hydrogen 
content of the materials used to form the package can be 

reduced by baking at an elevated temperature for an 
extended period of time, e.g., at 150°C for 200 hours.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to packaged high power
semiconductor lasers and a method and package therefor.Maintaining laser stability and prolonging laser life
may require control of the laser operating environment,
especially temperature, humidity and atmosphere, which is
relatively inert with respect to the semiconductor laser
materials, the art teaching that an oxygen free atmosphere
extends laser life. Also a dry atmosphere is preferred to
prevent reaction with the laser materials and to preserve
the integrity of the miniature electric circuitry
associated with the laser operation. For a further
discussion of appropriate microcircuit packaging see,
"Considerations in the Hermetic Packaging of Hybrid
Microcircuits", Byrnes et al., Solid State Technology,
1984. For example, an atmosphere of dry nitrogen with a
helium tracer provides a favorable laser operating
environment. The term dry, as used in this document, in
general refers to a gaseous medium having a water content
less than about 5000 ppm. However, as semiconductor laser
facet power has increased to 50 mW and higher, these
generally accepted strategies for stable, long term laser
operation have provided inadequate. For a laser having a
facet size of about 2 microns by 1 micron, a power output
of 50 mW translates into an average power density at the
facet of the order to 1 megawatt/cm2. Laser ends facets, 
which essentially delimit the lasing cavity, can change in
reflectivity and can even be destroyed when a high power
laser is operated in a dry helium/nitrogen atmosphere.
Materials which can contaminate the container include
solder flux, oils, epoxies and cleaning agents used in the
process of producing high powered semiconductor laser
devices, resulting in particulate and gaseous contamination
reaching the surface of the facet coatings, and producing
impurity deposits thereon. Such deposits can change the
facet reflectivity, reducing transmitted power, and
increasing absorptivity at the facet which causes facet
heating and eventual laser failure. Therefore, new
strategies are needed to meet those laser applications
which require high power together with assurance of laser
stability and longevity.JP A 60186076 discloses that the presence of oxygen in
hermetically sealed packages containing InGaAsP/InP lasers,
having an operating optical power of 3-5 mW, reduces
the leakage current.The invention is disclosed in claims 1, 6 and 7. Various embodiments of the invention are disclosed in the dependent claims.The present invention meets the need for
