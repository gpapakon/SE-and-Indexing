<ABSTRACT>
Linearization procedure of the transfer non-linear characteristic of an analog-to-digital
converter commonly available on the market and relevant circuit. According to a

first embodiment, we operate on two analog-to-digital converters assumed to be
similar, employing in the calibration phase a generic signal at the input of both, directly

to the first converter and attenuated to the second one, and collecting a minimum
number of appropriate digital samples at their outputs. The subsequent processing of

the above-mentioned samples through a processor enables to determine the transfer
inverse non-linear characteristic of the converter. According to a first solution, a

processor enables to "apply" in real time the inverse transfer characteristic determined
at the digital outputs of the converter in the on-line operation. Or, in a second solution,

this last can be written in a mapping memory, placed downstream one of the
converters, in the on-line operation it allows to correct original non-linearities. A second

online memory enables the adaptive operation.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to the field of conversion of electrical signals in
digital form and more in particular to a linearization procedure of the transfer
characteristic of an analog-to-digital converter and relevant circuit.Several parameters feature the correct operation of an analog-to-digital
converter; among these, the most significant ones are undoubtedly:
the resolution, which is the minimum value of the input signal, that the converter
can discriminate; the maximum conversion speed, that is, the maximum sampling frequency
allowed by specifications, limiting the band width of the signal to be processed; the maximum band width of the input signal, limiting the minimum sampling
frequency; the maximum dynamic range of the input signal, and finallythe signal-noise (S/N) ratio at output, determined by the quantization noise, by
the jitter of the sampling clock, and by a parameter known as SFDR (Spurious Free
Dynamic Range) indicating the value in dBFS (dB Full Scale) of the ratio between the
amplitude of the input fundamental and the amplitude of the maximum value harmonic.This last parameter (SFDR) indicates the linearity degree of the converter
transfer characteristic and assumes great importance in applications where great
linearity is requested, such as for instance in the mobile telecommunication field, of
special competence of the applicant. Recent developments in this sector foresee in fact
the realization of a broad band digital receiver which due to the particular architecture
adopted, requires that all the components of the whole conversion/ amplification chain
have a highly linear transfer characteristic. Therefore, it is essential that the A/D
converter, on his side, does not introduce significant distortions. In this context, the
requirements relevant to the SFDR requested by the A/D converter to satisfy the
specific GSM 900 MHz and DCS 1800 MHz result being around 95 and 100 dBFS.An A/D converter capable to meet the above mentioned requirements lies
outside those commonly found on the market, mainly due to the difficulty to conjugate, 
at limited costs, high operation speeds, input broad band and best linearity;
requirements these that must be jointly present in an A/D converter suitable for use in
the above mentioned receiver. On the other hand, the ad hoc realization of a converter
having similar characteristics would involve considerable difficulties and costs, so that
the most convenient way is to fall back on the best commercial devices capable to
satisfy the speed and input
