<ABSTRACT>
An apparatus for interpolating image signals in an 
image processing unit for receiving image data of original 

pixeles to store the same in image data memory means thereby 
to output said image data in a designated magnification, said 

apparatus comprising: clock generating means for generating 
second clocks by regularly defaulting clocks from an array of 

periodic first clocks on the basis of a prescribed rule in 
compliance with said magnification, read means for reading 

said image data stored in said image data memory means on the 
basis of said first clocks when said magnification is for 

enlargement, said reading being performed on the basis of 
said second clocks; interpolation data generating means for 

interpolating said image data as read to generate at least 
one interpolation data; and interpolation data assigning 

means for selectively assigning said interpolation data to 
additional pixels added by said default of said clocks on the 

basis of selection data previously set in correspondence to 
said prescribed rule.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an 
apparatus for interpolating image signals, and more 
particularly, it relates to an apparatus for 
interpolating image signals in processing of input and output 
images which are different in number of pixels. In order to, for example, enlarge or reduce images, it 
is necessary to output the images in a different number of 
pixels from that of input images. Generally well known is 
technique of varying magnifications of images for an image 
processing device such as a process scanner, a laser printer, a 
facsimile or the like which temporarily stores image data in a 
memory having storage capacity for, e.g., one scanning line 
while relatively varying pixel clocks (or memory addresses) for 
writing and reading the image data in and from the memory with 
target magnifications thereby to increase or decrease the number 
of pixels. Examples of such technique are as follows: A first system employs a frequency dividing circuit 
included in a PLL circuit, the frequencey dividing ratio of 
which is varied to change pixel clock frequencies in writing and 
reading operations as disclosed in, e.g., Japanese Patent  
 
Publication Gazette No. 50561/1977. Although such a method 
substantially has no problem in a low frequency range, the PLL 
circuit is complicated in stucture and a high-speed processing 
circuit (device) is required in order to obtain outputs of a 
highly enlarged magnification value in an apparatus requiring 
processing in a high frequencey range, whereby the cost is 
inevitably increased. In a second system, pixel clocks are employed in such a 
manner that additional pulses are inserted between ordinary 
periodic pixel clocks, i.e., synchronous pulse trains, as 
disclosed in, e.g., Japanese Patent Laying-Open Gazette No. 
11601/1978. Such pixel clocks are adapted to designate addresses 
for writing in a memory while the original pixel clocks are 
adapted to designate addresses for reading from the memory, 
whereby reproduced pixels in the pattern of an original are 
increased in number in comparison with the pixels read or 
sampled from the original to provide enlarged image outputs. On 
the other hand, the pixel clocks may be adapted to designate 
the addresses for reading, thereby to obtain reduced image 
outputs. In such a system, however, the additional pulses must 
be inserted between the pulse trains in predetermined periods, 
whereby designation of magnifications for varying the same is 
restricted to, e.g., a range of 50 to 200% in the embodiment as 
di
