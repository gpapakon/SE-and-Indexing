<ABSTRACT>
So that the acceleration experienced by the occupant (O) of an aircraft seat, especially of a rotor craft seat, in the event of an accident, remains lower than a humanly tolerable limit, whatever the size of this occupant, a seat is proposed in which height adjustment of the seat pan (16), on which the occupant is accommodated, also has the effect of altering the inclination of the energy absorbers (38). Thus, the vertical component of the retention force exerted on the seat pan (16) by these absorbers reduces with the size of the occupant, which obtains the desired result.

Aircraft seat, incorporating a pan (16) able to receive an occupant (O),
a frame (12) fixed to the aircraft floor (10), and a connecting structure

(34) between the pan and the frame, incorporating pan height regulating
means (36) and energy absorption means (38), exerting a retaining force on

the pan, characterized in that the regulating means (36) act on the energy
absorption means (38) in order to modify the inclination thereof, in such a

way that the vertical component of the retaining force varies in the reverse
sense to the distance separating the pan (16) from the floor (10), during an

actuation of the regulating means (36).
Aircraft seat according to claim 1, characterized in that the energy
absorption means (38) exert a constant retaining force on the pan (16).
Aircraft seat according to claim 1 or 2, characterized in that the
energy absorption means (38) comprise at least one pair of energy absorbers

(50) arranged substantially symmetrically with respect to a median vertical
plane of the seat, first ends of each pair being separated by a constant

distance, whereas the other ends of said absorbers are separated by a
distance varying during an actuation of the regulating means (36).
Aircraft seat according to claim 3, characterized in that the frame (10)
has two parallel, lateral guides (18) on which the pan (16) is mounted in

sliding manner, the first ends of the absorbers (50) of each pair being
articulated to said guides, whereas the other ends of said absorbers are

connected to a back (40) of the pan (16) by two articulated levers (56)
connected to the regulating means (36), said levers (56) being symmetrical

relative to said median vertical plane.
Aircraft seat according to claim 4, characterized in that levers (56)
are articulated to the other ends of the absorbers (50) of each pair and to

a fitting (60) fixed to the back (40).
Aircraft seat according to any one of the preceding claims, characterized
in that the regulating means (36) comprise means (66) for locking the 

pan (16) in a given position.
Aircraft seat according to claims 5 and 6 combined, characterized in
that the levers (56) are articulated to a first end of the absorbers (50),

to a central portion of the fitting (60) and to a variable length link (62),
incorporating the locking means (66), at their second end.
Aircraft seat according to any one of the preceding claims, characterized
in that means (68) for automatically raising the pan (16) are provided.
Aircraft seat according to claim 8 combined with any one of the claims
5 to 7, characterized in that the automatic pan raising means (68) are

interposed between the levers (56).
