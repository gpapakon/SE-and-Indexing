<ABSTRACT>
An ophthalmic suspension comprising diflupredonate as an 
active ingredient. The ophthalmic suspension of the present 

invention shows superior antiinflammatory action and 
antiallergic action by local administration. Accordingly, the 

suspension of the present invention is useful for the treatment 
and prevention of disorders of the eye, such as allergic 

conjunctivitis, vernal conjunctivitis, blepharitis marginalis, 
catarrhal conjunctiv
itis and uveitis.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an ophthalmic suspension
containing difluprednate, which is an antiinflammatory
steroid, as an active ingredient.Difluprednate (6α, 9α-difluoroprednisolone 17-butyrate
21-acetate) is an antiinflammtory steroid developed for local
application, and is known to show superior antiinflammatory
action by percutaneous administration (US Patent Nos. 3780177,
3784692). Difluprednate reportedly shows superior antiinflammatory
action and antiallergic action by percutaneous
administration and subcutaneous administration [Pharmacometrics,
29 (3), 343-353 (1985), Pharmacometrics, 29 (3), 355-362
(1985)]. In view of such pharmacological actions, difluprednate
is currently used mainly as a therapeutic drug for
skin disorders such as eczema and dermatitis in the form of an
ointment or a cream.It is also expected that difluprednate will be effective
for the treatment of various eye disorders by local
administration to the eye, since difluprednate has superior
antiinflammatory action and antiallergic action. The
aforementioned US Patent Nos. 3780177, 3784692 detail
formulation of difluprednate into an eye ointment for local
administration to the eye. However, when a local 
administration to the eye is desired, an eye ointment is not
entirely easy to use. Accordingly, formulation into an eye drop
is preferred for the reason of easy administration. However,
Difluprednate has low solubility in water and preparation of a
stable eye drop containing difluprednate at a therapeutically
effective concentration is difficult. Thus, a pharmaceutical
preparation of difluprednate which can be instilled to the'eye
has not been provided.An object of the present invention is to provide a novel
pharmaceutical preparation of difluprednate, which permits
instillation to the eye.Another object of the present invention is to provide an
agent containing Difluprednate for local administration to the
eye, which exhibits superior preparation stability.It has now been found that a suspension of difluprednate
provides a novel pharmaceutical preparation which can be
instilled to the eye.It has been also found that a suspension of difluprednate
may, when left standing for a long time, form secondary
particles due to partial agglomeration caused by mutual adhesion
of suspended particles, or a hard deposit layer (caking) on the
bottom surface of a container; or may have a lowered pH. Such
formation of secondary particles or caking causes problems in
terms of particle size and redispersibility (hereinafter
secondary
