<ABSTRACT>
A data receiving apparatus comprises: a receiving 
portion for receiving a QPSK (PSK, GMSK) signal using a 

local oscillation signal; a forward (FWD) equalizing 
portion for effecting a FWD equalization to the PSK signal 

using FWD tap coefficients, including a FWD main tap 
coefficient, successively renewed; a backward equalizing 

portion for effecting a backward equalization to the PSK 
signal using backward tap coefficients, including a 

backward main tap coefficient, successively renewed; and a 
prediction portion for predicting a phase difference 

between a carrier frequency of the PSK signal and the local 
oscillation frequency according to the FWD and backward 

main tap coefficients. In this apparatus, the FWD and 
backward equalizing portions effect FWD and backward 

equalizing training processings using the sync word in the 
PSK signal in the FWD and backward directions to determine 

the FWD and backward tap coefficients before FWD and 
backward equalizations respectively. It may further 

comprise a correction portion for compensating a phase 
difference in outputs of the FWD and backward equalizing 

portions according to the predicted phase difference. The 
local oscillation frequency is controlled according to the 

predicted phase difference.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a data receiving apparatus
for receiving data and particularly to a data receiving
apparatus used for a digital mobile unit communication with
a phase correction.A data receiving apparatus used for a digital mobile
unit communication with a phase correction is known. In
such data receiving apparatus, a phase shift keying (PSK)
method is used. In the phase shift keying method, for
example, data "1" is transmitted by advancing a phase of a
carrier signal and data "-1" is transmitted by delaying the
phase of the carrier signal. In the phase shift keying
method, the carrier signal is given by:
E(t) = Ecos ( ω ot+  (t))
where ω o is a frequency of the carrier signal.In the quadrature phase shift keying method (QPSK), at
least four kinds of data is transmitted through combination
of data represented by phase shifting two carriers having a
phase difference of π /2 each other.If there is no phase difference between an
oscillation frequency used for transmitting the carrier 
signal on the transmission side and the oscillation
frequency used for demodulation on the receiving side, an
in-phase component(real number component) Ri and quadrature
component(imaginary number component) Rq are given by:
Ri(t)= Ecos(ω ot+  (t)) x sin ω ot
   =1/2 x Ecos  (t)+1/2 x Ecos(2 ω ot+  (t))Rq(t)= Ecos(ω ot+  (t)) x cos ω ot
   =1/2 x Esin  (t)+1/2 x Esin(2 ω ot+  (t)).
wherein each of the second terms are suppressed by a
low-pass filters. Therefore, these equations are rewritten
by:
Ri(t)= 1/2 x Ecos  (t)Rq(t)= 1/2 x Esin  (t).
A data receiving apparatus employing this method judges
that  (t) is equal to 0, π /2, π, or -π/2, so that a
symbol is decoded in accordance with the combinations of
the in-phase component Ri(t) and the quadrature component
Rq (t), namely, (E/2, 0), (0, E/2), (-E/2, 0) and (0, -E/2)
are discriminated.When there is a constant frequency difference ω d
between the transmission and receiving sides, the received
signal is represented by:
Ri(t)= Ecos( ω ot+  (t)) x cos ( ω o + ω d)t
   =1/2 x Ecos(  (t)- ω dt)
      +1/2 x Ecos(2 ω ot+ ω dt+  (t))Rq(t)= Ecos( ω ot+  (t)) x sin(ω o+ ω d)t
   =1/2 x Esin(  (t)- ω d)t
      +1/2 x Esin(2 ω ot+ ω dt  (t)).
wherein the second terms are suppressed by low-pass filters.
Therefore, they are given by:
Ri(t)= 1/2 x Ecos(  (t)- w dt)Rq(t)= 1/2 x Esin(  (t)- w d)tAs mentioned above, when there is a difference
between the carrier frequency on the transmission side and
a signal for demodulating on the receiving side, there is a
phase
