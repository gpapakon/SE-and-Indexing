<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to methods for treating diabetes mellitus. The present
invention also relates to antagonists of the potassium channel Kv2.1, methods for
using and preparing the antagonists, and assays for identifying such antagonists.The secretion of insulin by the pancreatic β-cell plays a critical role in regulating
glucose metabolism. Derangement in insulin secretion can therefore lead to
impaired regulation of blood glucose, manifesting as hypoglycemia or hyperglycemia
resulting in for example insulin-dependent (Type 1) diabetes mellitus or non-insulin
dependent (Type 2) diabetes mellitus (NIDDM). Unlike type 1 diabetes, with NIDDM
there is no autoimmune destruction of pancreatic β-cells.The treatment of Type 2 or non-insulin dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM)
remains unsatisfactory despite the widespread use of insulin and oral agents
(sulfonylureas, biguanides and thiazolidinediones). Unfortunately the available oral
agents suffer from a number of undesirable side effects which limit their usefulness
in treatment of NIDDM. There is thus a clear need for the development of novel
hypoglycaemic agents which may be less toxic or which suceed where others are
ineffective.β-cells located within the islets of Langerhans in the pancreas respond to an
increase in glucose concentration by secreting insulin (Boyd AE III, J. Cell Biochem.,
48, 234-241, 1992). The mechanism by which glucose acts as an insulin
secretagogue is not completely understood, but a major component of its effect on
β-cells is mediated via changes in K+ conductance. A number of types of potassium
channels are present in β-cells: these include calcium activated potassium channels,
ATP sensitive potassium channels (KATP), and delayed rectifier potassium channels
(Kv) (Dukes ID, Philipson LH, Diabetes, 45, 845-853, 1996). The respective roles of
these potassium channels in regulating glucose - stimulated insulin secretion has not
been fully elucidated. Kv channels are multimeric membrane proteins that permit the efflux of K+ from cells
when the membrane potential is excited (i.e. depolarized) (Hille, 1993 Ionic
Channels of Excitable Membranes, 2nd ed., Sunderland MA, Sinauer Associates,
1991). A number of isoforms of Kv channels have been described, and a uniform
nomenclature for their naming has been agreed (Chandy KG, Gutman GA, Trends
Pharmacol. Sci., 14, 434, 1993). There are currently 8 families of mammalian
delayed rectifier potassium channel genes (Kv1.x-8.x), 4 of which (Kv1.x-4.x) have
been demonstrated to encode
