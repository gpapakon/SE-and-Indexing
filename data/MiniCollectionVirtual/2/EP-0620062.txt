<ABSTRACT>
The (ingot) mould according to the invention is provided with a thermo-insulating hot top (2) made from rigid refractory material implanted on the tube element made from chilled copper (1) and means (8, 18, 12, 12, 13, 10) are provided for injecting, through the wall, a pressurised gas which emerges in the casting space 3 in the form of anular jets (streams) which cut through any solidification skin (crust) already formed by the cast metal (4) in contact with the refractory hot top (2). The invention makes it possible to distance the meniscus (7) from the solidification front of the cast metal in the copper element by eliminating the risks of incipient solidification between the two.

Process for the continuous casting of molten
metals, especially steel, in a vertical or curved mould,

comprising an intensely cooled tubular metal element (1)
defining a passage (3) for the cast metal (4) and

intended to initiate, upon contact with it, the solidification
(15) of the cast metal, in which process a

thermally insulating pouring bush (2) is placed on the
said element (1), which pouring bush extends the said

passage upwards and is made of a rigid refractory in
order to be capable of containing the cast molten metal

and on which are likely to form spurious solidifying
skins (14), characterized in that a gas is injected level

with this pouring bush, or at least at its base, this gas
emerging as jets distributed annularly at the surface of

the pouring bush (2) into the passage (3) for the cast
metal (4) so as to obtain a shearing effect of the said

spurious solidifying skins (14).
Process according to Claim 1, characterized in
that a gas which is chemically inert with respect to the

cast molten metal is used.
Process according to Claim 1, characterized in
that the said gas is injected under an outlet pressure at

the surface of the pouring bush which is at least 20%
greater than the ferrostatic pressure at the point of the

outlet.
Process according to Claim 1, characterized in
that a lubricant is injected into the said passage (3)

through the said tubular metal element (1).
Vertical or curved mould for the continuous 
casting of molten metals, especially steel, comprising:


an intensely cooled tubular metal element (1)
defining a passage (3) for the cast product (4) and

intended to cause, upon contact with it, the start of the
solidification (15) of the cast metal,
a pouring bush (2) made of a rigid refractory
having thermally insulating properties, which is fitted

directly on the tubular element (1), extending it
upwards,

   characterized in that the mould furthermore
includes means (8, 13, 12, 10) for injecting a gas under

pressure through the wall of the mould, which gas emerges
as jets distributed annularly at the surface of the said

pouring bush into the passage (3) for the cast metal.
Mould according to Claim 5, characterized in that
the said injection means comprise a single slot (8) made

at the interface between the pouring bush (2) and the
cooled metal element (1).
Mould according to Claim 5, characterized in that
the said injection means comprise staged slots made in

the pouring bush (2).
Mould according to Claim 6 or 7, characterized in
that the slots have a thickness of from one to three

tenths of a millimetre.
Mould according to Claim 6 or 7, characterized in
that the said slots are continuous annular slots all

around the perimeter of the pouring bush.
Mould according to Claim 5, characterized in that
the thermally insulating refractory pouring bush (2) is

made of a mixture of alumina and silica in respective
proportions of 90 and 10% by weight.
Mould according to Claim 5, characterized in that
the injection means furthermore comprise a box (10),

provided with a pressurized-gas inlet pipe (11) and
mounted in a sealed manner (17) around the pouring bush

(2) and of which the external surface (16) of the said
pouring bush constitutes a wall of the box and is

provided with means (12, 13, 8, 18) for conducting the
gas from the box right into the casting space (3).
