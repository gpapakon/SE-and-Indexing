<ABSTRACT>
Method for transporting by ship materials that are 
flammable, polluting and highly hazardous to transport, 

comprising: subdivision of the cargo into a plurality of 
basically cylindrical tanks (2) of relatively small 

dimensions; and insertion of said tanks (2), such that 
their longitudinal axis is vertical, into special 

housings formed in the decks (12, 13, 14) of a ship (1), 
said tanks (2) not being fastened to the ship (1) itself 

in any way.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to maritime transport 
and in particular to methods for transporting 
cargoes of liquids that are flammable and potentially 
polluting, and hence dangerous to transport, such as 
crude oil and its derivatives. Crude oil is commonly transported in special 
ships known as oil tankers, constructed to provide a 
series of voluminous tanks that can be filled with the 
fluid in question. Today such ships are the principal 
means of transporting petroleum, and although widely used 
they present a whole series of disadvantages. In the first place, such ships are quite 
unequipped, should a serious shipping accident or shipwreck 
occur, to prevent heavy loss of material which will 
mean financial loss and, more importantly, massive 
environmental damage. Such accidents as have occurred to 
date, though fortunately low in number, have nevertheless 
left an indelible mark on the environment. This is to be 
attributed to the fact that in reality, such ships do not 
provide sufficient means to prevent the dispersal of 
their contents into the sea. Also to be considered are defects relating to the 
maintenance of said ships, which is often very difficult 
because of the enormous size of their tanks; which leads 
to increased costs and exposes maintenance workers to 
substantial risks, caused in large part by the presence 
of gases which are released inside the tanks and stagnate 
therein. Besides this, as already noted, the virtual 
impossibility of recovering oil lost in such accidents 
must be considered, along with the resulting obvious 
financial loss and the already mentioned environmental  
 
damage. A variety of solutions have been put forward to 
solve this kind of problem; for example, that ships be 
built with twin hulls in order to avert the dangers of 
accidents. This system has very little bearing on maintenance, 
however, except for the fact that it provides a 
limited guarantee - limited because the second hull too 
may under certain circumstances become damaged, and we 
are left with the original problem. To overcome this and other problems, the present 
invention provides a method for transporting flammable 
and polluting materials by sea such that safety on these 
cargo ships is greatly enhanced both in the event of 
accidents and during ordinary maintenance and loading and 
unloading operations. According to the method of the invention, the 
polluting cargo is subdivided into a plurality of cylindrical 
tanks of relatively small dimensions, which are 
inserted

<CLAIMS>
Method for transporting by ship fluid materials that are 
flamable, polluting and highly hazardous to transport, 

characterized by the fact of comprising the steps of: 
subdividing the fluid cargo into a plurality of cylindrical 

tanks (2) of comparativelly small dimensions; forming a 
plurality of housings in the deck (12, 13, 14) of a ship (1) 

for individually accomodating said tanks (2), and inserting 
said tanks (2) into said housing in the number of one tank 

(2) for each housing with their longitudinal axis oriented 
vertically. 
Method according to claim 1, in which said tanks (2) are 
inserted onto the decks (12, 13, 14) of the ship (1) in 

staggered rows. 
Method according to Claims 1 and 2, in which said tanks 
(2) rest on dampers (3) located in the bottom of the ship 

(1). 
A tank for performing the method of claims 1 to 3, 
characterized by the fact that it comprises a long, 

cylindrical metal drum having a central chamber (22) for 
containing the fluid material to be transported and at least 

one second chamber (24; 23) full of air or other gas, the 
said second chamber or chambers (24, 23) having a volume 

such as to render the fully ladent tank buoyant. 
Tank according to claim 4, further comprising an air 
 

piston system for loading and unloading said tank, said air 
piston system consisting of a piston (5) fitted inside the 

central transporting chamber (22), and of means for 
admitting and discharging air into and from the transporting 

chamber (22). 
Tank according to Claims 4 and 5, in which said means for 
admitting and discharging air are two valves, one for 

admission and one for discharging, located on the bottom 
wall (25) of the chamber (22) containing the material to be 

transported. 
Tank according to claims 4 and 5, in which said means for 
admitting and discharging air are the rod (51) of the piston 

(5), said piston rod (51) being hollow and open at its top 
end which emerges outside the pipe (6). 
Tank according to claims 4 to 7, comprising a system for 
controlling the thermal expansion of the transported 

material in the form of an expansion vessel comprising a 
first chamber (24) communicating with the underlying 

transported fluid containing chamber (22), and a container 
(10) made of deformable material and filled with a gas such 

as air or nitrogen. 
Tank according to claims 4 o 8, in which the pipe (7) 
through which the material being transported is unloaded and 

loaded is provided with a safety valve (73). 
Tank according to claims 4 to 9, in which said chamber 
 

(22) containing the material to be transported is provided 
at its bottom (25) with a discharge pipe (15) communicating 

with the exterior through a closure valve.
