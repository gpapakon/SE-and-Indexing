<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to phosphate-free granular laundry detergents and more 
particularly to such detergents having improved cleaning power. Granular laundry detergents, or laundry powders, typically comprise (A) one 
or more surfactants, such as alkyl sulfates, alkyl ether sulfates, alkylbenzene sulfonates, 
ethoxylated alkylphenols, ethoxylated alcohols, or amine oxides, and (B) one or more 
detergent builders, such as sodium tripolyphosphate, sodium nitrilotriacetate, or a 
sodium aluminum silicate. The use of a phosphate in these detergents is known to 
be undesirable from an environmental point of view, but the phosphate-free detergents 
hitherto obtained by replacing phosphate builders with other builders have suffered 
a considerable loss in cleaning power because of that replacement. It has been found that the use of certain carefully proportioned mixtures of 
an ethoxylated fatty alcohol, an anionic surfactant, and an amine oxide corresponding 
to the formula RR'R"NO in which R is a primary alkyl group containing 8-24 carbons; 
R' is methyl, ethyl, or 2-hydroxyethyl; and R" is independently selected from methyl, 
ethyl, 2-hydroxyethyl, and primary alkyl groups containing 8-24 carbons can make it 
possible to provide a phosphate-free, sodium aluminum silicate (zeolite)-containing 
granular laundry detergent which has a cleaning performance comparable to that of 
a phosphate-containing laundry detergent. It has also been discovered that, when the amine oxide is one in which R' and 
R" are independently selected from methyl, ethyl, and 2-hydroxyethyl, and it is blended 
with the zeolite so as to provide 2.3-7.0 mmols of amine oxide per gram of zeolite, 
it increases the divalent ion sequestration rate of the zeolite; and the use of the blend 
in the laundry detergent minimizes premature precipitation of the anionic surfactant 
from solution when the laundry detergent is used.  
 Thus, the invention resides in: 
(A) a phosphate-free laundry detergent which comprises (1)1-30% by 
weight of a surfactant, (2) 1.50% by weight of a sodium aluminum silicate detergent 
builder, (3) 1-20% by weight of sodium silicate, (4) 0.1-5% by weight of an anti-redeposition 
agent, and (5) 10-80% by weight of inorganic filler, the surfactant 
consisting of (a) a mixture of 20-98% by weight of the aforementioned ethoxylate, 1-75% 
by weight of an alkali metal or ammonium salt of an alkylbenzene sulfonate in 
which the alkyl group contains 10-18 carbons, and 1-20% by weight of the aforementioned 
amine oxide
