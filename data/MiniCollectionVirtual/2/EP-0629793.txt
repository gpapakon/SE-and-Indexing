<ABSTRACT>
The jamming (holding) device is of the type acting for at least one strand, especially including a pusher (6) defining the rotation pin (11) of a jammer member (5), also including a hollow body (4), one cavity (15) of which, on the one hand, defines at least one passageway for each strand length and, on the other hand, a housing for the jammer member (5), this jammer member (5) being of circular shape and free to rotate about the pin (11) which itself can move in terms of translation, this device operating through interaction of the jammer member (5) with each passage for jamming each strand length by a wedging effect and so that, according to the invention, the jammer member (5) is elastically urged in the direction for jamming the strand length or lengths by action on its rotation pin (11).

<CLAIMS>
Device (1) for blocking at least one strand of thread (17), comprising a hollow body
(4), a blocking member (5), and pusher (6), the hollow body (4) comprising a cavity (15)

defining on the one hand, at least one path (16) for passage of each strand of thread (17), and
on the other hand, a housing for the blocking member (5), the blocking member being

adapted to cooperate with each path (16) for the wedging-effect blocking of each strand of
thread (17), the blocking member having a circular shape and being mounted rotationally free

within the cavity (15), the pusher (6) being translationally affixed to the blocking member (5)
for maneuvering the latter in the blocking direction (4), characterized in that the blocking

member (5) is mounted rotationally free with respect to the pusher (6) about an axis (11) of
direction (26) substantially perpendicular to the blocking direction, and in that elastic means

(25) are associated to the pusher (6) which bias it elastically in the blocking direction S of the
strand(s) ofthread (17).
Blocking device according to claim 1, characterized in that the elastic means (25) are
arranged between a surface of the pusher (6) and a heel (26) formed by an edge of the body

(4).
Device according to one of claims 1 or 2, characterized in that the elastic means is
constituted by two tongues (25) extending in a V-shape from the pusher (6), and whose free

ends take support on the heel (26).
Device according to claim 3, characterized in that the elastic means (25), the pusher
(6) and the support axis (11) of the blocking member (5) constitute one single element. 
Device according to one of claims 1, 2 or 4, characterized in that the axis of rotation
(11) of the blocking member (5) is slit along a portion of the length and comprises a truncated

end and a groove (14), to enable locking of the blocking member (5).
Device according to any of claims 1 to 4, characterized in that the pusher (6)
comprises a cavity (27) whose shape corresponds subst
antially to that of a fingers.
Device according to any of claims 1, 4 or 5, characterized in that the blocking
member (5) is a toothed wheel.
Device according to claim 1, characterized in that the blocking path (5) is equipped
with gouges (22).
Device according to one of claims 1, 2 or 3, characterized in that the body (4)
includes, on each of its upper and lower surfaces, a cavity whose shape corresponds

substantially to that of a finger.
