<ABSTRACT>
A submersible vessel comprises a body portion (10) and a seat portion (12), the body portion (10) having a window (11) and being arranged to contain a volume of air above the seat portion when the vessel is submerged. A user can sit astride the seat portion (12) with his head projecting out of the water and into the volume of air for breathing. The vessel may include a propulsion motor (41), particularly an electric motor, or it may have no propulsion motor in which case the user can "walk" along the sea or river bed.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a submersible vessel.A known type of submersible vessel comprises a sealed chamber which
houses one or more occupants. The occupants enter the chamber via a hatch and
can spend considerable lengths of time underwater. The vessel includes air tanks
supplying air for breathing to the chamber as well as to buoyancy tanks which
enable the vessel to dive and surface. The vessel also includes motors enabling
the vessel to be manoeuvred underwater.Another type of submersible vessel is arranged to form a bubble of air
at the same pressure as the surrounding water. Divers can enter and leave the
vessel underwater via a hatch.These known vessels are large and heavy and expensive to operate.A still further type of submersible vessel is shown in FR 2577511 A,
which comprises a chassis to which a seat is mounted, there being provided a
chamber into which the head of a user projects, the chamber holding a supply of
air thus enabling the user to breathe.However, this type of vessel is cumbersome and difficult to manoeuvre.We have now devised a submersible vessel which alleviates the
problems mentioned above.In accordance with this invention as seen from a first aspect there is
provided a submersible vessel comprising a body portion and a seat portion, the
body portion being arranged to contain a volume of air above the seat portion
when the vessel is submerged so that at least the user's head can project out of
the water into said volume of air thereby enabling the user to breathe,
characterized in that the seat portion may be straddled by the user such that the
legs of the user may extend freely below the vessel.The body portion of the vessel only needs to be relatively small.Preferably ballast weights are provided in the seat portion so that the
vessel remains upright in the water.Preferably the volume of air is replenished from a compressed air
cylinder. The cylinder is preferably mounted in the seat portion, the user sitting
astride the cylinder. The vessel may be propelled by a motor which is driven by compressed
air. Alternatively the vessel may be propelled by an electric motor powered by
batteries preferably housed on the seat portion. Instead, the vessel may have no
motor (or the motor may be de-energised) and the user may "walk" along the sea
or river bed whilst remaining astride the seat.It will be appreciated that the vessel will consume a considerable
amount of compressed air when in use.An embodiment of this invention will now be described by way of
example only and with

A submersible vessel comprising a body portion and a seat portion, the
body portion being arranged to contain a volume of air above the seat portion

when the vessel is submerged so that at least the user's head can project out of
the water into said volume of air thereby enabling the user to breathe,

characterized in that the seat portion may be straddled by the user such that the
legs of the user may extend freely below the vessel.
A submersible vessel according to claim 1 wherein the body portion
extends substantially vertically from a front end of the seat enabling the rider to

have access to the surrounding environment on the sides of the vessel.
A submersible vessel according to claim 1 or claim 2 comprising a
propulsion system operatively coupled to one of the seat and the body portion for

propelling the submersible vessel under the water.
A submersible vessel according to claim 3, wherein the propulsion
system comprises an electrically powered motor and a propeller driven by the

motor.
A submersible vessel according to claim 3 or claim 4 wherein the
propulsion system comprises a motor, a propeller driven by the motor, and a

directable nozzle for directing a flow of water produced by the propeller.
A submersible vessel according to any one of the preceding claims
comprising a ballast weight within the seat and removable therefrom to facilitate

carrying the submersible vessel on land.
