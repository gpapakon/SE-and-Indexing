<ABSTRACT>
To improve 
the reliability and 

reduce an ineffective 
displacement of a 

rotary compressor by 
providing the same 

with a swingable 
blade capable of 

preventing the 
breakage of a root 

portion thereof. In 
a rotary compressor 

employing a 
swingable blade, a 

bulging portion (41) 
is formed on a root 

portion, which is 
joined to a roller 

(3), of the blade 
(4), and a recess 

(52) for receiving 
the bulging portion 

(41) is provided in a 
swingable bush (5).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a rotary
compressor primarily for use in a refrigerator.Generally, a rotary compressor has a motor-driven
compression member provided within a closed casing. This
compression member comprises: a cylinder which has a
cylinder chamber, and a suction port and a discharge port
both opened to the cylinder chamber; a roller which is
insertedly fitted to an eccentric shaft of a drive shaft
extending from the motor and which revolves in the cylinder
chamber along with rotation of the drive shaft; and a blade
which is supported at an intermediate portion between the
suction port and discharge port of the cylinder so as to be
free to advance and retreat radially. The blade is so
arranged that part of high-pressure gas discharged from the
discharge port acts on its back face as back pressure,
which back pressure in turn causes the tip of the blade to
be always kept in contact with the outer peripheral surface
of the roller. As a result, the interior of the cylinder
chamber is partitioned into a low-pressure chamber 
communicating with the suction port and a high-pressure
chamber communicating with the discharge port.However, when the blade is supported to the
cylinder so as to be free to advance and retreat, and has
back pressure given on its back face side so that the tip
of the blade is always kept in contact with the outer
peripheral surface of the roller as described above, the
contact portion between the blade and the outer peripheral
surface of the roller is poorly fed with lubricating oil so
as to be brought into metallic contact, during relative
rotation of the roller and the blade. The result would be
greater friction loss due to sliding resistance and
therefore greater power loss, to a disadvantage. Further,
high-pressure gas compressed in the high-pressure chamber
may leak through the contact portion between the tip side
of the blade and the roller into the low-pressure chamber.
This would cause another problem that compression
efficiency deteriorates.Thus, the present inventor has before proposed a
rotary compressor which can solve the above problems
(Japanese Patent Laid-open Publication No. HEI 5-202 874). Although
this patent application has not been laid open yet, nor is
it the prior art of the present invention, yet it is here
described for an easier understanding of the present
invention. The rotary compressor, as shown in Fig. 8, 
comprises a cylinder A having a cylinder chamber A1, and a
roller C fitted to an eccentric shaft B1 of a drive shaft B
and internally

<CLAIMS>
A rotary compressor which comprises: a cylinder (2)
having a cylinder chamber (21); a roller (3) fitted to an

eccentric shaft (61) of a drive shaft (6) and internally
provided in the cylinder chamber (21); a blade (4) which is

protrusively coupled with an outer peripheral portion of the
roller (3) and which partitions the interior of the cylinder

chamber (21) into a low-pressure chamber (Y) communicating
with a suction port (22) and a high-pressure chamber (X)

communicating with a discharge port (23); the blade (4) having
a swelling portion (41) formed at a joint portion of the blade

(4) to the roller (3); and a swinging bush (5) which has a
receptive groove (51) for receiving a protruding tip side of

the blade (4) in such a way that the tip side of the blade (4)
is free to advance and retreat, the bush (5) being swingably

supported in a retainer hole (25) of the rotary compressor;

characterized in that

said retainer hole (25) is formed in said cylinder (2) and
that a recessed portion (52) formed in the bush (5) serves for

receiving the swelling portion (41).
The rotary compressor as claimed in Claim 1, wherein
the swelling portion (41) is formed on the high-pressure

chamber side of the joint portion of the blade (4) to the
roller (3), and the recessed portion (52) for receiving the 

swelling portion (41) is provided on the high-pressure
chamber side of the swinging bush (5).
The rotary compressor as claimed in claim 1, wherein
the swelling portions (41) (41) are formed in a pair on both

the high-pressure chamber side and the low-pressure chamber
side at the joint portion of the blade (4) to the roller

(3), and the recessed portions (52)(52) for receiving the
swelling portions (41)(41) are provided on both the high-pressure

chamber side and the low-pressure chamber side of
the swinging bush (5).
The rotary compressor as claimed in claim 3, wherein
the swinging bush (5) is composed of a pair of unitary

bushes (5a)(5b) having a semi-circular cross section, the
receptive groove (51) is formed between opposite faces of

the unitary bushes (5a)(5b), and recessed portions (52) of
identical shape for receiving the swelling portions (41)

formed at the joint portion of the blade (4) are provided
in the unitary bushes (5a)(5b).
The rotary compressor as claimed in claim 1 or 3, wherein
the roller (3) has, on an outer peripheral portion thereof

opposite to the swinging bush (5), a fitting groove (31)
extending in parallel to the drive shaft (6), and the blade 

(4) comprises an inserting portion (4a) to be inserted into
the receptive groove (51) in such a way that the inserting

portion (4a) is free to advance and retreat, a coupling
portion (4b) thicker than the inserting portion (4a) and

securely fitted to the fitting groove (31), and the
swelling portion (41) formed between the inserting portion

(4a) and the coupling portion (4b).

the roller (3) has, on an outer peripheral portion thereof

opposite to the swinging bush (5), a fitting groove (31)
extending in parallel to the drive shaft (6), and the blade

(4) comprises an inserting portion (4a) to be inserted into
the receptive groove (51) in such a way that the inserting

portion (4a) is free to advance and retreat, a coupling
portion (4b) thicker than the inserting portion (4a) and
