<ABSTRACT>
A device for damping of the turning movement of a joint, for example an artificial knee joint (10), is designed in such a way that the shaft (21) of one of the pivot points of the joint is provided with a gear-wheel (30) which in a hydraulic cylinder (1) influences a piston (27) connected to a rack-gearing (28). Channels (40, 41) with chokes and back valves (71, 91; 72, 92; 75, 93) connect the two sides of the piston of the hydraulic cylinder making possible adjustable damping in several steps for different parts of the turning movement. Moreover, a compact design of joint and damping cylinder is achieved. The application also refers to artificial joints including abovementioned devices for damping of the turning movement, especially artificial knee joints of the polycentric type with seven pivot points.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an artificial joint including one upper part and one
lower part turnably connected to each other through at least one first pivot point and
provided with a device for damping of the turning movement of the joint. It especially
relates to such an artificial knee joint, in which it is not possible to install conventional
damping cylinders with a cylinder block into and out of which a piston rod is
reciprocating. The present invention is particularly adapted to be used with artificial
knee joints of the type with seven pivot points which is further described in the
Swedish patent application no. 91001183-4 and PCT/SE91/00240, but damping
cylinders according to the present invention can also with advantage be utilized with
artificial joints of other types such as for example with polycentric knee joints with four
pivot points and even with joints having one single pivot point.The artificial joint type with seven pivot points which is described in the above
mentioned patent publication makes a great progress per se in relation to the previous
state of the art. Equipped with a hydraulic damping cylinder as described below and
according to the claims the joint is also given a control of the swing phase which,
together with the quality of stability of the joint, produces an artificial knee joint which
lies very close to a natural leg functionally despite the lack of active components to
replace muscle force.It is known in the art to arrange hydraulic damping cylinders with other artificial joints,
see for instance EP 0097226. In its simplest design the damping cylinder comprises a
piston and channels with chokes in the cylinder between the opposite sides of the
piston. The present invention also relies on this principle. But according to the present
invention no piston rod moving into or out of the damping cylinder is used, because it
will involve disadvantages and difficulties to build such conventional damping
cylinders into for instance such knee joints with multiple pivot points as mentioned
above. It has also been known for a long time, from the Swiss patent
publication no. 248 586, to arrange hydraulic damping
cylinders in such a way that the longitudinal movement of the
piston is directly transferred to a turning movement by means
of gear teeth on the piston in mesh with a gearwheel. This
construction, mainly intended for door closers, has a built
in spring with a spring force acting on the piston in one
direction while the piston includes a spring loaded valve
opening on

<CLAIMS>
An artificial joint, particularly knee joint (10), including one upper part and one
lower part turnably connected to each other through at least one first pivot point (2) and

provided with a device for damping of the turning movement of the joint,
characterized in

that the upper part of the joint constitutes an upper bearing bridge (1) containing a
hydraulic cylinder (23), which is to be firmly connected to an upper part of a

prosthesis to be attached to a leg stump, the lower part of the joint is connected to the
upper part of the joint by means of at least one shaft (21) connected to a gear-wheel (30) which at

least partly extends through the hydraulic cylinder, the gear-wheel is meshing with a
rack-gearing (29) connected to a piston (27) of the hydraulic cylinder (23), and the movement

of the piston (27) is influenced by the resistance in channels leading hydraulic fluid

from one side of the hydraulic cylinder (23) to the other.
An artificial joint according to claim 1,
characterized in

that the shaft hole (2) of the first pivot point extends transverse the hydraulic cylinder
(23), that a shaft (21) is arranged in the shaft hole of the first pivot point, a link (9) is

locked to the shaft (21) which is connected to the gear-wheel (30), which at least partly
extends into the hydraulic cylinder (23).
An artificial joint according to claim 1 or 2,
characterized in

that movement of the piston (27) is influenced by the resistance against the flow of
hydraulic fluid in channels (40, 41) for the hydraulic fluid leading from one side of the

hydraulic cylinder to the other, and that back valves (91,92,93) are arranged in opposite
directions in the channels making the hydraulic fluid flow in different channels for each

direction of movement. 
An artificial joint according to claim 3,
characterized in

that the movement of the piston (27) is influenced by the resistance from at least one
adjustable choke (71,91;72,92; 75,93) in at least one of the channels (40,41).
An artificial joint according to claim 4,
characterized in

that at least one of the channels (40) for hydraulic fluid also has a second outlet into the
hydraulic cylinder that can be provided with an adjustable choke (72,92) making

possible selective damping for different segments of the turning movement.
An artificial joint according to claim 5,
characterized in

that a piston device (20) of the damping cylinder (23) is shaped with a wedge-shaped
groove extending from the front end of the piston (27) and backwards, situated opposite

the second outlet and giving a smoother closing of the second outlet when the piston
device (20) is moved.
An artificial joint according to any of claims 1 - 7,
characterized in

that the joint is of the polycentric type with seven pivot points.
