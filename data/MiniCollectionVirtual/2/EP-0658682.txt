<ABSTRACT>
An earth-boring bit (11) has a cutter (15) 
provided with hard gage inserts (61; 71) that protrude from 

the gage surface (23) of the cutter (15) to engage the side 
of the borehole for holding gage. The gage insert (61; 61) 

has a substantially flat, polygonal face (63; 73), the sides 
of the polygonal face (63,;73) defining at least a pair of 

sharp cutting edges (65; 75) and at least a pair of cutting 
surfaces (67; 77) that define a negative rake angle with 

respect to the sidewall (51) of the borehole that is being 
sheared by the gage insert (61; 71). The face (63; 73), 

cutting edge (65; 75), and cutting surface (67; 77) of the 
gage insert (61; 71) are formed of a super-hard and 

abrasion-resistant material such as polycrystalline diamond 
or cubic boron nitride. The body (33) of the insert (61; 71) 

is formed of a hard, fracture-tough material such as 
cemented tungsten carbide. The improved gage inserts 

(61; 71) are secured into sockets in the gage surface (23) 
of the rolling cone cutter (15) by interference fit. The 

improved gage inserts (61; 71) provide an actively cutting 
gage surface that engages the sidewall (51) of the borehole 

to promote shearing removal of the sidewall material. Such 
an improved gage insert (61; 71) provides an earth-boring 

bit (11) with improved gage-holding ability, and improved 
steerability in directional drilling operations.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to cutter assemblies for rolling cone
earth boring bits, specifically to the hard inserts for use in
such cutter assemblies.Earth-boring bits of the rolling cone variety rely on the
rolling movement of at least one cutter over the bottom of the
bore hole for achieving drilling progress. The
earth-disintegrating action of the rolling cone cutter is
enhanced by providing the cutter with a plurality of protrusions
or teeth. These teeth are generally of two types: milled teeth,
formed from the material of the rolling cone; and inserts, formed
of a hard material and attached to the rolling cone surface.One measure of a rolling cone earth-boring bit's performance
is its ability to "hold gage," or maintain a consistent borehole
diameter over the depth or length of the borehole. Maintenance
of a consistent borehole diameter expedites and simplifies the
drilling process because drill strings may be removed from and
inserted into a hole of generally consistent diameter more easily
than a borehole of varying diameter. Gage holding ability is of
particular importance in directional drilling applications.To achieve this gage holding ability, the rolling cones of
such earth boring bits have been provided with hard inserts on
the outermost, or gage, surface of the rolling cones. These gage
inserts have functioned primarily as wear pads that prevent the
erosion of the gage surface of the rolling cone, thereby
permitting the earth boring bit to hold a more consistent gage 
or borehole diameter. One example of such an insert is disclosed
in U.S. Patent No. 2,774,571, December 18, 1956, to Morlan.
Other gage inserts are shown in U.S. Patent No. 3,137,355, June
16, 1964, to Schumacher; U.S. Patent No. 3,389,761, June 25,
1968, to Ott; and U.S. Patent No. 4,729,440, March 8, 1988, to
Hall.Two staggered rows of such gage inserts are disclosed in
U.S. Patent No. 4,343,372, August 10, 1982, to Kinzer. U.S.
Patent No. 4,940,099, July 10, 1990, to Deane et al., discloses
alternating polycrystalline diamond and tungsten carbide gage
inserts mounted substantially flush with the gage surface of the
rolling cone cutter.The gage inserts described in the above references are
passive in operation, that is, they serve only as wear-resistant
inserts and are not designed to actively cut the gage of the
borehole. Such wear-resistant inserts are susceptible to
heat-cracking and spalling in operation, and may fail to provide
adequate gage-holding ability. Loss of gage-holding ability or
gage protection can lead to
