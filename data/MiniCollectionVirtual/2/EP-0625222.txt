<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to the dyeing of keratin fibres (cf. claims 1 and 22), and has particular
though not exclusive application to the dyeing of tippy wool.
The invention also relates to improvements in the equilibrium exhaustion of insect-proofing
agents added to dye baths, compared with the levels obtained by existing
methods. The invention is primarily concerned with wet dyeing processes which
utilise water soluble dyes as distinct from, e.g. water dispersible dyes.Wool and other keratinous fibres are usually dyed by exhaustion methods from acidic
liquors: the liquors often contain various reagents in addition to dyes. The purpose
of these reagents is to control the manner in which dyes are sorbed by the fibres and
hence to control the evenness of the final dyeing. These compounds, collectively
referred to as "levelling agents", may be inorganic salts such as sodium sulphate, but
for many wool dyes, various types of surfactants are more effective as levelling
agents. Anionic, cationic or amphoteric surfactants are commonly used, either alone
or in blends, for dyeing wool by exhaustion methods. The mode of action of these
levelling agents, especially the surfactants, usually involves formation of a complex
with the dye. The complex is sorbed more evenly by the wool than the dye alone.Improved evenness of dye sorption is particularly important when dyeing tippy wool
in order to avoid a skittery appearance in the final product, and thus surfactant
levelling agents are generally employed when dyeing tippy wool. Tippy wool is wool
damaged by weathering to such an extent that the tip and root portions of fibres
have markedly different dyeing properties. "Skittery" is a term used to describe an
undesired speckled effect arising from differences in colour between adjacent fibres
or portions of the same, an effect often associated with dyeing tippy wools.Although the dye/surfactant complex improves evenness of dye sorption, formation 
of the complex can lead to a decrease in the equilibrium exhaustion of the dye; this
is wasteful of dyestuff and causes possible effluent disposal problems. The latter is
a particular problem for dyestuffs containing heavy metal atoms, for example
chromium, cobalt or copper.Another possible problem in wool dyeing that can result from the presence of
surfactant-type levelling agents in the dyebath involves the application of chemicals
that prevent damage of wool products by insects, e.g. moths, during storage or use.
Such insect-proofing agents are often applied to wool
