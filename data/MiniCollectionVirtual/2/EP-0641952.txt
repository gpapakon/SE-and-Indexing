<ABSTRACT>
A coil-spring-supporting device includes a tension coil 
spring (11) which includes two small-diameter portions (13) near both 

ends which portions (13) are smaller in winding diameter than the 
remaining portion (12), and a pair of engaging means (14) provided at a 

spring mounting region where the tension coil spring (11) is to be 
mounted, the engaging means (14) being engaged with the two 

small-diameter (13) 
portions in such a manner that the small-diameter (13) 

portions are held by the engaging means (14). Each of the engaging 
means (14) is made up of a pair of supporting cylindrical pins (15).

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a spring device comprising a tension 
coil spring including two small-diameter portions which are 
smaller in winding diameter than the remaining portion thereof. For instance, in mounting a tension coil spring on an 
apparatus, as shown in FIG. 3 the tension coil spring 1 is 
connected through its hooks 2 at both ends to protrusions which 
are provided at a spring mounting region of the apparatus. The above-described conventional tension coil spring is 
disadvantageous in the following points: In order to 
automatically mount a number of the above-described tension 
coil springs on apparatuses, they are put in an automatic part 
supplying device. In this case, they are liable to be tangled 
with one another because of the hooks 2, so that it is 
difficult to regularly supply the tension coil springs 1. On 
the other hand, in manufacturing the tension coil spring 1, it 
is considerably difficult to make the right and left hooks 2 of 
the coil spring 1 bisymmetrical. And, in automatically 
mounting the tension coil spring, it is difficult to hold with 
a chuck the tension coil spring which is asymmetrical with a 
chuck. Thus, it is not practical to automatically mount the 
tension coil spring 1 with the hooks 2 at both ends. Furthermore, 
the manufacture of the tension coil spring is relatively 
large in the number of manufacturing steps, including a primary 
manufacturing step of winding a wire to form a coil, and a 
secondary manufacturing step of forming the hooks 2 at both 
ends of the coil thus formed.  
 Document FR-A-2 093 712 discloses a coil spring supporting 
device comprising a coil spring including two small-diameter 
portions which are smaller in winding diameter than the 
remaining portions thereof, and a pair of engaging members for 
holding the coil spring. Said engaging members are fitted to 
the two small-diameter portions of said coil spring. However, 
said engaging members are arranged such that said coil spring is 
bent into a substantial U-shape to impart a force of pressure 
onto wiper contacts or carbon brushes, respectively, for biasing 
same against a commutator. In view of the foregoing, an object of the invention is 
to provide a coil-spring-supporting device which prevents the 
coil springs from being tangled with one another when they are 
automatically supplied, and, in the manufacture of the coil 
springs, makes it possible to make the coil spring 
bisymmetrical, and reduces the number of manufacturing steps. The foregoing object is solved for a
