<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to certain indole derivatives, salts, esters and
physiologically functional derivatives thereof, to their use in medical therapy
and in particular to their use for the manufacture of a medicament for the
treatment or prophylaxis of at least one viral infection.Of the DNA viruses, those of the herpes group are the sources of the most
common viral illnesses in man. The group includes herpes simplex virus
(HSV), varicella zoster virus (VZV), cytomegalovirus (CMV); Epstein-Barr virus
(EBV) and human herpes virus 6 (HHV6). HSV 1 and HSV 2 are some of the
most common infectious agents of man. Most of these viruses are able to
persist in the host's neural cells; once infected, individuals are at risk of
recurrent clinical manifestations of infection which can be both physically and
psychologically distressing.HSV infection is often characterised by extensive and debilitating lesions of
the skin, mouth and/or genitals. Primary infections may be subclinical
although tend to be more severe than infections in individuals previously
exposed to the virus. Ocular infection by HSV can lead to keratitis or
cataracts thereby endangering the host's sight. Infection in the newborn, in
immunocompromised patients including AIDS patients or penetration of the
infection into the central nervous system can prove fatal.Transmission of the virus is by direct physical contact between a host and a
recipient; the spread of HSV infection is therefore considered a very
significant social problem, particularly as no effective vaccine is yet available.Varicella zoster (VZV) is a herpesvirus which causes chickenpox and
shingles. Chickenpox is the primary disease produced in a host without
immunity and in young children is usually a mild illness characterised by a 
vesicular rash and fever. Shingles or zoster is the recurrent form of the
disease which occurs in adults who were previously infected with varicella-zoster
virus. The clinical manifestions of shingles are characterised by
neuralgia and a vescicular skin rash that is unilateral and dermatomal in
distribution. Spread of inflammation may lead to paralysis or convulsions.
Coma can occur if the meninges becomes affected. In immunodeficient
patients VZV may disseminate causing serious or even fatal illness. VZV is of
serious concern in patients receiving immunosuppressive drugs for transplant
purposes or for treatment of malignant neoplasia and is a serious complication
of AIDS patients due to their impaired immune system.In common with other herpes
