<DESCRIPTION>
A method for making a lithographic printing plate 
that comprises imagewise exposing a developer-incorporated, 
light-sensitive material comprising a 
support, and at least a negative silver halide emulsion 
layer and a surface physical development nucleating 
layer on said support, and processing said construction 
in a silver complex diffusion-transfer alkaline 
activator containing an aminophenol. This invention relates to a method of making a 
lithographic printing plate by the silver complex 
diffusion transfer process. In particular, this 
invention relates to a method of preventing developer 
mottle, toning and lack of transfer density when 
processing developer-incorporated plate material in 
fresh alkaline activator solutions. As described in various embodiments, e.g., U.S. 
3,728,114, U.S. 4,160,670 and U.S. 4,361,635, 
diffusion-transfer imaging systems can provide a 
lithographic printing plate due to the oleophilic 
nature of the complexed silver in the receptor layer 
and the hydrophilic developed silver image in the 
emulsion layer. However, a very rapid development 
process is required to reduce exposed areas into non-diffusing 
silver images before the silver halide 
solvent can take effect. The greater the 
differentiation between the (unexposed) complexed 
silver and the (exposed) developed image area, the 
better the printing quality will be. However, the high  
 
pH required to produce such an active chemistry causes 
rapid oxidation of the developing agents. One method 
of overcoming this limitation is to incorporate the 
developing agents into the light sensitive medium and 
processing in an alkaline solution. With respect to diffusion-transfer systems, in 
particular, a monosheet lithographic plate as described 
in U.S. 4,361,635 and EP 375,159, disclose a surface 
which consists of an extremely thin layer of physical 
developing nuclei such as palladium sol or salt 
thereof. If developing agents are incorporated into 
such a construction and the plate is machine processed 
in fresh alkaline activator, there is insufficient and 
uneven transfer development. The result is an 
oleophilic image that lacks printing endurance and has 
an undesirable bronze rather than shiny silver tone. 
Without wishing to be limited to any one particular 
theory, but it is assumed that these defects arise from 
the incorporated developer being eluted from the 
surface nucleating layer by the recirculating action of 
the processor before transfer development is complete. According to G.M. Haist,
