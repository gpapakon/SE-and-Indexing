<CLAIMS>
A brush roll, in particular for sheet feeders in
printing machines, having a hollow cylinder (2) that is

held at the ends in bearings (1) and rotates about its
axis and, in the region of its outer circumference, has

radially outwardly projecting, asymmetrically distributed
bristles (3) and at least one metallic counterweight (4),

characterized in that the hollow cylinder (2) consists of
a polymeric material, which is reinforced by means of

fibres and/or filaments (5) embedded therein, the
bristles (3) are arranged in a row parallel to the axis

of the hollow cylinder at one circumferential point, and
in that the metallic counterweight (4) is embedded into

the wall of the hollow cylinder (2) on the side located
radially opposite the bristles (3).
A brush roll according to claim 1, characterized
in that the counterweight (4) is of strip-shaped design.
A brush roll according to claim 1 or 2, characterized
in that the fibres (5) and/or filaments consist

of carbon and/or glass.
A brush roll according to one of claims 1 to 3,
characterized in that the polymeric
 material of the
hollow cylinder (2) is epoxy resin or phenolic resin.
