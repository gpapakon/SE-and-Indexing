<ABSTRACT>
A system and method for controlling gear ratio 
changes in an automatic transmission includes an electronic 

microprocessor (50), an electronic memory (62) accessible to 
the microprocessor, solenoid-operated shift valves (70, 72, 

74), pressure actuated friction clutches and brakes, a 
variable force solenoid-operated valve, a torque converter 

bypass friction clutch (82), and control algorithms that 
produce output signals to control the state of the solenoid-operated 

valves (70, 72, 74). The vehicle speed and engine 
speed at which upshifts and do
wnshifts occur, according to a 
standard gear shift schedule, is compensated for loss of 

engine torque at conditions that differ from the conditions 
at which a reference shift schedule is defined. Vehicle 

speed is compensated for torque variation with reference to 
the ratio of current calculated engine torque divided by 

current engine output torque.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to control of gear ratio
changes in automatic transmissions. More particularly, the
invention pertains to altering, on the basis of variations
in engine output torque, vehicle speed and engine speed,
where upshifts, downshifts and torque converter bypass
clutch engagements and releases are scheduled to occur
according to reference schedules of control.Conventionally, the electronic control system for an
automatic transmission is provided with a gear shift
schedule that defines conditions of current engine throttle
position and vehicle speed at which each gear ratio change
is to occur. Generally, data located in look-up tables
stored in electronic memory, relating vehicle speed and
engine throttle position for each of the gear ratio changes,
are used to produce a signal representing the desired gear
ratio. When the desired gear ratio is different from the
current gear ratio, a command signal is produced by the
control to cause a change in state of solenoid-operated
shift valves. This changes the state of the planetary gear
units and causes the gear ratio to change.A reference schedule of gear shift boundaries is
continually referenced during execution of control
algorithms and used to produce an upshift signal and a
downshift signal when a boundary of the gear shift schedule
is crossed. Gear shifts are made by continually probing
computing memory with current values of throttle position
and vehicle speed, and determining, on the basis of the
stored shift schedules, whether an upshift or downshift is
required. Upshift points are determined also on the basis
of maximum engine speed when a wide-open throttle condition
is detected.U.S. Patent 4,943,921 describes an electronic control
for scheduling gear shifts in an automatic transmission on 
the basis of variations in ambient barometric pressure. Various
functions relating vehicle speed and throttle position
determine the occurrence of each upshift and downshift by
probing computer memory, in which the gearshift functions
reside, with current values of the throttle position and
vehicle speed. A reference gear shift schedule is corrected for
the difference between the operating barometric pressure and
a reference barometric pressure, at which the gear shift
schedules are calibrated, to automatically compensate for the
effect of barometric pressure variations on the gear shift
schedule.US patent No. 4,393,463 describes an electronic control
system in which a reference gear shift schedule defining
conditions under which upshifts or
