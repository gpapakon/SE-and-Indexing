<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to an apparatus (1) for dedusting dustladen gases by means of a high-performance dust separators which are constructed as eddy chambers (2) and are connected in parallel to a crude gas channel (3) and are connected to purified gas collecting channels (4) and dust separation channels. Each eddy chamber (2) is constructed as a single dedusting module (6), a plurality of these module-like eddy chambers (2) being mounted in a gastight manner parallel with one another in four perforated plates (7, 8, 9, 10) arranged at a distance from one another. The two inner perforated plates (7, 8) form a crude gas channel (3). In each case one dust conveying space (5) is constructed between the inner perforated plates (7, 8) and the outer perforated plates (9, 10). The outer perforated plates (9, 10) are surrounded by a purified gas collecting channel (4).

A device for removing dust from dust-laden gases by 
means of a high-performance dust remover of swirl-chamber 

design, which is connected in series with a 
passage for untreated gas and linked with collector 

passages for scrubbed gas as well as dust discharge 
passages, whereby each swirl chamber (2) is designed 

as a separate dust-removing module (6), 
characterised in that a plurality of these modular-type 

swirl chambers (2) are housed parallel with one 
another so as to be gas-tight in four perforated 

plates (7, 8; 9, 10) arranged at a distance from one 
another, wherein the two inner perforated places (7, 

8) form a passage for untreated gas (3), respective 
dust conveyor chambers (5) are formed between the 

inner perforated plates (7, 8) and outer perforated 
plates (9, 10) and the outer perforated plates (9), 

(10) are surrounded by a collector passage (4) for 
scrubbed gas. 
A device as claimed in claim 1, characterised in 
that the perforated plates (7, 8; 9, 10) consist of 

part-plates. 
A device as claimed in claims 1 and 2, characterised 
in that the swirl chambers (2) are arranged stepped 

one above the other and horizontally adjacent to one 
another. 
A device as claimed in claims 1 to 3, characterised 
in that, arranged at the untreated gas inlet (11), 

is a settling chamber (12), to which the passage for 
untreated gas (3) is connected.  

 
A device as claimed in claims 1 to 4, characterised 
in that the horizontal untreated gas intake orifices 

(13) of the swirl chambers (2) of a column (14) of 
swirl chambers are so arranged facing the untreated 

gas inlet orifices (13) of the swirl chambers (2) of 
an adjacent column (14) of swirl chambers that 

several similar vertically directed flows of 
untreated gas (15) pass in alignment from the 

settling chamber (12) between the columns (14) of 
swirl chambers. 
A device as claimed in claim 5, characterised in 
that the columns (14) of swirl chambers are arranged 

parallel with one another. 
A device as claimed in claim 5, characterised in 
that the columns (14) of swirl chambers, whose 

untreated gas intake orifices (13) face one another, 
are arranged offset at an angle one from the other. 
A device as claimed in claims 1 and 2, characterised 
in that the lateral boundary walls (15) of one of 

the dust bunkers (16) assigned to the device (1) 
connects with the outer perforated plates (9, 10). 
A device as claimed in claims 1 to 8, characterised 
in that the inner and outer perforated plates (7, 8; 

9, 10) are joined to sections of frame-supports (17) 
used to retain the device. 
A device as claimed in claim 1, characterised in 
that the swirl chambers (2) are made up of forged 

metal components. 
A device as claimed in claim 1, characterised in  
 

that the swirl chambers (2) are made up of cast 
components. 
A device as claimed in claim 1, characterised in 
that the swirl chambers (2) are made up of plastics 

components. 
A device as claimed in claims 10 to 12, 
characterised in that the swirl chambers (2) are 

built by a combined system whereby the components 
are made by casting or forging or made from plastics 

materials.
