<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a method of increasing interference diversity in an FDMA/TDMA-based cellular system, in which system a transmission channel of the system between a mobile station (12) and a base station (11) is realized as a burst in a time slot of a TDMA frame (30) of a carrier of the base station. According to the invention, frequency hopping is used in a first part of the base stations (11) of the system, and interference diversity is increased further in such a way that additionally, in a second part of the base stations (11) of the system, at least one transmission channel uses at least two different time slots of a TDMA frame in sequential TDMA frames (30) in accordance with a predetermined repeated sequence, and that the sequences used by the separate base stations (11) are mutually coordinated in such a manner that at least the sequences used by the cells situated within the range of influence of each other are mutually sufficiently uncorrelated. The invention relates further to a cellular system according to the method.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a method of increasing
interference diversity in an FDMA/TDMA-based cellular
system according to the preamble of the attached
claim 1 and to a cellular system according to the
preamble of the attached claim 8.The capacity of cellular networks is limited by
a so-called co-channel interference caused by the
fact that, according to the known principle of a cellular
network, the same radio frequencies are used
repeatedly as a reuse pattern defined by frequency
planning.To guarantee a service sufficiently free from
interference, a radio network must be planned in view
of the worst expectations. This means that the basic
planning situation must be assumed to be a continuous
interfering signal in a co-channel cell (a cell sharing
the same frequencies) and still usually in such a
topological arrangement which produces the highest
interfering signal (terminal at that edge of the interfering
cell which is closest to the interfered
cell and transmission powers set to the maximum). To
keep the interference caused by this worst case sufficiently
low, a reuse pattern sufficiently relaxed
is selected for the cellular network.The planning of a cellular network based on the
worst case described above limits the capacity of the
system. This has to be considered as a distinct disadvantage,
because the situation of the worst case is
realized during the operation of the network on rare
exceptional occasions only. Accordingly, the network
must in practice be provided with extra safety margin
compromising the capacity of the network. The known GSM system has the property of frequency
hopping, which spreads the influence of interferers
among a larger number of users. According to
the frequency-hopping principle, the transmission
frequency is changed continuously during transmission
of a signal and the receiving frequency during reception,
respectively, by using a suitable number of
frequencies, e.g. four predetermined frequencies.
These frequencies form a so-called hopping sequence.
Within one cell, the hopping sequences are mutually
synchronized (collisions do not occur between channels
of a single cell) and independent of each other
among cells with the same allocated frequencies. In
the GSM system, frequency hopping is an optional feature
for a base station and an obligatory one for a
mobile station.Two kinds of advantages are gained from the use
of frequency hopping, namely so-called frequency and
interference diversity effects. The desirable effect
of frequency diversity is based on the fact that
