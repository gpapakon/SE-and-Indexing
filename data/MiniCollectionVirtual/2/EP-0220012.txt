<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to layered magnetic film structures 
comprising Fe-Si-Al alloy film, and particularly comprising 
magnetic films of such alloy having internal stresses 
substantially zeroed and providing excellent magnetic 
properties, and a method of producing the same. Magnetic films of Fe-Si-Al alloy are suitable 
for use as magnetic cores for high density recording 
heads for high frequency use requiring a high S/N 
ratio, such as thin-film laminated magnetic heads 
used primarily as VCR and disk files and the like. With a recent marked improvment in the recording 
density in the field of magnetic recording, there has been an 
increasing need for a reduction in the track width for magnetic 
heads serving as electromagnetic transducer elements, intensified 
saturation magnetization of core materials, and 
an improvement in permeability in the high frequency 
range of core materials. Core members for a magnetic head have 
heretofore been fabricated by cutting ferrite or 
Fe-Si-Al material into a block and forming the block  
 
with grooves 3 for defining the track width 2 and 
grooves 4 for receiving coil windings by the use 
of a dicing blade, saw or the like, as shown in 
Fig. 5. However, in order to fabricate magnetic 
heads having narrow tracks less than 30 µm wide, 
it is necessary to reduce the spacings of the grooves 
3 for defining the track width to extremely small 
dimensions, with the result that problems have arisen 
due to lack of precision of the track width 2 and 
irregularities in shape due to chipping in the portions 
of the track width 2. On the other hand, for metallic magnetic 
thin-film heads comprising metallic magnetic thin 
films such as conventional Fe-Si-Al alloy, such 
magnetic materials have been utilized which are 
laminated to a predetermined film thickness by stacking 
such metallic magnetic films 3 to 10 µm thick and 
non-magnetic insulation films about 0.5 µm thick 
in alternating relation. More specifically, in manufacturing such 
metallic magnetic thin-film heads, the laminated 
magnetic material may be fabricated by sputtering 
(see JP-A-58-100412, Sony k.k.) 
films on a substrate to a thickness corresponding 
to the track width wherein the process for defining 
the track width is eliminated, whereby the problems  
 
involved in fabricating magnetic heads from a block-type 
core material as described above may be resolved. However, it has been found through research 
and experiments conducted by the present inventors 
that metallic magnetic films formed by
