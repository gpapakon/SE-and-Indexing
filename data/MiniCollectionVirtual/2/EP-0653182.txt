<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a portable measuring apparatus as defined in the
precharacterizing portion of claim 1.US-A-4,407,295 discloses such portable measuring apparatus, in particular a wrist-worn
apparatus, in which a sensor for measuring physiological data, such as the pulse rate, or
environment data is incorporated in a wrist watch type wrist side measuring device. In this
portable apparatus, a sensor for measuring the pulse rate is disposed on a portion of the side
portion of a wrist watch type apparatus body, while a connector is disposed on a portion of the
side surface of the apparatus body which is remotest from the sensor so that an external
measuring device for measuring the heart sound can be detachably connected thereto. Another
example of the conventional portable apparatus, disclosed in US-A-4,450,843, is constructed
such that a connector of a sensor for measuring the pulse rate is detachably connected to the
side portion of a wrist watch type apparatus body. GB-A-2 052 051 discloses a digital watch
having a pulse sensor unit detachably mounted via a connector provided on the front surface
portion of the watch case.However, the above-described conventional portable measuring apparatuses are insufficient in
terms of the ease with which the apparatus is used or the function thereof. Particularly, in
recent years, there is a tendency that the portable apparatus is used during exercise for health
care, and hence there has been an increasing demand for a portable measuring system which is
capable of general measurements.The document EP-A-0289 208 discloses an electrical connector apparatus has a connector
socket and a connector plug which can cooperate so that electrical contacts of the connector
socket engage respective electrical contacts of the plug and the connector socket and the
connector plug are kept in engagement with each other by magnetic force, whereby when
unintentional tension is applied to a cord coupled to the plug, the cord will not be broken since
the connector socket and the connector plug can be easily disengaged from each other.In view of the aforementioned problems, a primary object of the present invention is to provide a
portable measuring apparatus which is easy to use and which is capable of general
measurements and which assures firm connection of a connector of an external unit by a
magnetic force, and is capable of preventing adverse influence of the magnetic force on an
apparatus body.These objects are achieved with a portable measuring apparatus as

<CLAIMS>
A portable measuring apparatus for measuring one or more physiological parameters
of a user, comprising


a wrist watch type apparatus body (1),
a band (90) the user winds around his or her arm,
a wrist side measuring device (20) disposed on said wrist watch type apparatus body
and having a measuring unit (3), serving as a physiological parameter sensor; and
an external measuring device (30, 32) detachably connected to said wrist side
measuring device and adapted to measure physiological parameter data,
characterized in that
 said wrist side measuring device (20) incorporates an environment
data measuring mechanism for measuring environment data and has a connector (40; 50) for

detachably connecting said external measuring device (30, 32) to said wrist side measuring
device, said connector being provided on a front surface portion of either said apparatus body

(1) or of said band (90), wherein magnetic means are
provided whose magnetic force is utilized to connect said apparatus body (1) and said external

measuring device (30, 32) to each other, said magnetic means having
at least two magnets (35) which are disposed in a matching connector (33)
of said external device (30, 32)

in such
a manner that said at least two magnets are separated from each other, and
magnetizable members (42; 52) made of a soft magnetic material which are disposed in
either said apparatus body (1) or said band in such a manner that said magnetizable members

face said magnets,

wherein said magnetizable members and/or said magnets are connected to each other

by a soft magnetic material (43; 53; 36).
The apparatus according to claim 1, wherein said environment data measuring
mechanism has an acceleration measuring unit (84) for measuring an acceleration generated by

a user's motion to offer a frequency thereof.
The apparatus according to claim 2, further comprising means (70) for correcting
said physiological parameter data by the accelereation measured by said acceleration measuring

unit (84).
The apparatus according to claim 1 or 2, wherein said connector (40) is provided on
the front surface of said band (90), said band having a movable cover (96) to cover said

connector.
The apparatus according to claim 1 or 2, wherein said magnetizable members are
connected by said soft magnetic material (53) being arranged to circle along a peripheral edge portion of a

front surface of said apparatus body (1).
The apparatus according to any one of the preceding claims, wherein said
measuring unit (3) is disposed at a first position on a side portion of said apparatus

body (1), and further comprising 

at least one operation button (6; 10) for operating electric parts provided in said
apparatus body (1), said operation button (6; 10) being disposed at a second position on said

side portion different from said first position,
said apparatus being adapted, for performing measurement by means of said measuring
unit (3), to be firmly gripped between two fingers of a user's hand, one finger at said first

position and another at a third position on said side surface substantially diametrically opposite
to said first position,

wherein said second position and said third position are the same such that the user is
enabled to perform measurement with one finger pressed against said measuring unit (3) while

at the same time the other finger is capable of operating said operation button (6; 10).
The apparatus according claim 6, wherein said operation button (6; 10) includes a
button body (6a; 11), and a button guide (6b; 12) for moveably supporting said button body (6a;

11) in a direction in which said button body (6a; 11) is operated, said button guide (6b; 12)
having a support surface protruding from an operation surface of said button body (6a; 11).
