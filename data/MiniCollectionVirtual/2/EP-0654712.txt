<ABSTRACT>
The present invention provides a method for forming 
a thin film pattern having an excellent accuracy of 

pattern. The method comprises the steps of: 

(a) exposing a polysilane layer formed from a 
polysilane having a structure of the formula: 


 
   wherein R₁, R₂, R₃ and R₄ indicate a group which is 

independently selected from the group consisting of a 
substituted or non-substituted aliphatic hydrocarbon 

residue, an alicyclic hydrocarbon residue and an aromatic 
hydrocarbon residue and m and n indicate an integer, 

provided on a substrate, to ultraviolet light selectively 
to form a latent image of the thin film pattern; and 
(b) dipping the polysilane layer in which the 
latent image of the thin film pattern was formed in a 

metal oxide sol and then drying.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method for
forming a thin film pattern on a substrate. More
particularly, it relates to a method for patterning a
functional ceramic thin film formed by means of a sol-gel
processing.A method for synthesizing a ceramic thin film using
a solution reaction (referred to as a "sol-gel
processing") has attracted special interest recently.
The sol-gel processing is a method comprising
synthesizing an inorganic polymer precursor from an
organic metal compound or a metal complex in a solution
by using a hydrolysis reaction or condensation reaction;
applying the solution on a substrate by means of a spray
method, dipping method or spin-coating method to form a
thin film; and subjecting the thin film to a heat
treatment to form a functional ceramic thin film. The
functional ceramic thin film is used as dielectric film,
insulator film, protective film, etc. in electronic devices
such as thin film capacitor, LSI, electroluminescent
device and the like, and the formation technique by means
of the sol-gel processing has been studied intensively.
On the other hand, in addition to the above electronic
devices, the sol-gel processing is applied for the surface
treatment of functional glass or plastic, for example,
anti-diffusion film of alkali, interference colored film, 
anti-reflection film, reflection film and the like.The method for forming a thin film by means of the
sol-gel processing has excellent characteristics such as
temperature reduction of process temperature, freedom of
composition, formation of uniform thin film on substrate
having large surface area and the like.However, there is no method of patterning a thin
film, and a method of removing a thin film by conducting
etching after formation of the thin film is popular. A
complicated lithography step using a photoresist is
required in order to conduct etching, and simplification
of the step has been required.Further, it has been studied to use a glass as the
substrate for magneto-optic disc in view of durability,
however, its practical application is falling behind
because of the largest disadvantage of the glass, i.e. a
pre-groove can not be formed at low cost. For example,
as the practical application of the sol-gel processing,
there have been proposed a method of transferring a
groove by a stamper while the gel is soft (Tohge et al.,
J. Am. Cream. Soc. 70, C13 (1987)) and RIE (Reactive Ion
Etching) method wherein a photolithography method is
combined with a dry-etching method after a SiO2 film was
formed (Ota et al.,
