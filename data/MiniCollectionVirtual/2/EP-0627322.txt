<ABSTRACT>
Printer mechanism (10) to control pen-to-print medium spacing (46) during 
printing is described. The preferred embodiment of the mechanism (10) includes a 

printhead (12), a platen (14) positioned adjacent the printhead (12) to define a print 
zone (20)therebetween, and the print zone (20) having an entrance region (20
a
)and an 
exit region (20
b
). The print mechanism (10) further includes a feed mechanism (16) 
positioned generally adjacent the print zone entrance area (20
a
) and a height limiter (18) 
positioned downstream of the print zone exit area (20
b
). In the preferred embodiment, 
the platen (14) includes a generally flat region (14
a
) and a generally inclined region 
(14
b
). The generally inclined region (14
b
) includes a relatively downstream edge (14
c
) 
which contacts a sheet of print medium (26) along a line of contact (48). In operation, 

the edge (14
c
) and the feed mechanism (16) suspend the sheet material (26) such that 
the sheet (26) is generally concavely curved relative to the printhead (12) between the 

edge (14
c
) and the feed mechanism (16), thereby ensuring proper pen-to-print medium 
spacing (46) during printing.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates generally to pen-to-print medium spacing
during printing in a wet ink printer. More particularly, the invention concerns an
apparatus that reduces uncontrolled bending of print medium in a print zone, the print
zone positioned adjacent the pen.Typically ink-jet printers, or any printers using wet ink, include a pen, also
called a printhead, a print zone positioned adjacent the printhead, a feed mechanism for
feeding print medium through the print zone, and a platen positioned adjacent the print
zone, the platen guiding and supporting the print medium in the print zone during
printing.During printing, ink is placed on the print medium by dropping or ejecting
the ink from the printhead, or by any other printing method well known by those skilled
in the art. Ink used in wet ink type printing includes a relatively large amount of water.
As the wet ink contacts the print medium, the water in the ink saturates the fibers of the
print medium, causing the fibers to expand, which in turn causes the print medium to
buckle. Buckling of the print medium tends to cause the print medium either to bend
downwardly away from the printhead, or to bend upwardly toward the printhead. In
either case, a constant pen-to-print medium spacing is not achieved, leading to poor print
quality. Additionally, upwardly buckling print medium may contact a pen nozzle,
leading to ink smearing on the print medium.Typically, to achieve good print quality, pen-to-print medium spacing of less
than 1.5 millimeter (mm), and preferably less than 1.0mm, is required. However,
bending amplitudes of print medium in certain pen/ink combinations can be greater than
3mm. To reduce this problem of paper buckling, which varies the pen-to-print
medium
spacing, various shaped platens were designed.The Hewlett-Packard Deskjet (a trademark of Hewlett-Packard) printer
includes a platen with a flat print medium contacting surface and a feed mechanism,
usually a drive roller, positioned adjacent the platen. The flat expanse of the platen is
positioned below the printhead such that the platen supports the print medium 
throughout a print zone defined between the printhead and the platen. The feed
mechanism is positioned such that print medium is fed at a downward angle onto the
platen such that the print medium is concavely curved relative to the printhead in an
initial region of a print zone. This small region of concave curvature generally does not
extend under the pen nozzles of the printhead. Thus, when the print medium does

A printer mechanism (10) to control pen(12)-to-print
medium (26) spacing during printing, the mechanism (10)

comprising: a printhead (12) for printing on a print medium
(26), a print medium feed mechanism (16) and a platen (14)

positioned adjacent the printhead (12) such that
the platen (14) and the printhead (12) define a print zone

(20) therebetween, the platen (14) including a raised ledge (14c)
in a downstream region (20b) of the print zone

(20), the platen (14) being configured for contacting the
print medium (26) along a line of contact (48) in

the print zone (20), the line of contact (48) being
transverse to a feed direction (B) of the print medium (26),

the line of contact (48) effecting a concave flexure in the
print medium (26) relative to the printhead (12)

through the print zone (20), the raised ledge (14c)
and the feed mechanism (16) cooperating to bias a portion of

the print medium upstream from the raised ledge (14c)
into a predefined flexure, thereby stiffening the print

medium (26) while it is advanced past the printhead (12) and
reducing uncontrolled bending of the print medium (26) in

the print zone (20), and
wherein the feed mechanism (16) is configured for

contacting the print medium (26) in a first region of
contact (42) transverse to the feed direction (B) of the

print medium (26) such that the feed mechanism (16) effects
downward movement of the print medium (26) relative to the

printhead (12), and such that the feed mechanism (16)
effects forward movement of the print medium (26) relative

to the feed direction (B), and wherein the raised ledge (14c)
is configured for supporting the print medium (26)

along the line of contact (48) such that the
raised ledge (14c) biases the medium (26) upwardly

relative to the printhead (12) and forwardly relative to the
feed direction (B), the feed mechanism (16) and the platen 

(14) cooperating to suspend the print medium (26) in a
controlled curve between the first region of contact (42)

and the line of contact (48).

printer mechanism (10) includes a flexure limiter (18)

positioned downstream from the print zone (20) and
adjacent a top surface (26a) of the print medium

(26), the flexure limiter (18) preventing the print medium
(26) from bending beyond the flexure limiter (18) in a

direction (C) toward the printhead (12), thereby preventing
the print medium (26) from contacting the printhead (12).
The printer mechanism (10) of Claim 1 or Claim 2,
wherein the line of contact (48) defines a line of

inflection (36) of the print medium such that the print
medium (26) is concavely curved relative to the printhead

(12) on one side of the line of inflection (36), and the 
print medium (26) is concavely curved relative to the platen

(14) on the other side of the line of inflection (36).
The printer mechanism (10) of any one of Claims 1 to 3,
wherein the platen (14) includes a region of flat expanse

(14a) upstream from the ledge (14c) for supporting the
medium's leading edge (26c) as the mechanism (16) advances

the leading edge (26c) toward the ledge (14c).
The printer mechanism (10) of any one of the preceding
Claims, wherein the feed mechanism (16) biases the medium

(26) away from the printhead (12) and the raised ledge (14c)
biases the medium (26) toward the printhead (12) to

produce concave flexure of such trailing portion of the
medium (26) relative to the printhead (12).
The printer mechanism (10) of Claim 2 and Claim 5, further
comprising the flexure limiter (18) downstream from the

raised ledge (14c), the flexure limiter (18) limiting
concave flexure of a leading portion (26c) of the medium

(26) downstream from the raised ledge (14c) and directing
such leading portion (26c) through an output port (20b) of

the printer.
