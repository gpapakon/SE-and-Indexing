<ABSTRACT>
The present invention relates to a high or medium voltage circuit breaker with abutting contacts, comprising, in an envelope (1) filled with gas having good dielectric properties, a first fixed abutting contact (8) linked to a first current terminal and a moving assembly including a first tube (2) capable of being displaced by an operating rod (3), the said first tube (2) being linked to a second current terminal and defining, with a second tube (4), a blowing volume (5) in which a fixed blowing piston (11) is arranged, this second tube (4) being extended by a blowing nozzle (6), the said circuit breaker also comprising a second semi-moving tubular abutting contact (9) sliding in the first tube (2) and pushed by its end opposite the first contact (8) by a first end of a helical spring (10) bearing by its second end on an annular shoulder (7) within the first tube (2). A temporary locking element, retractable by axial force, links the first tube (2) to the said envelope (1) in engagement position of the contacts (8, 9).

A high-voltage or medium-voltage circuit-breaker having end-on 
contacts and including a casing (1) filled with a gas having good 

dielectric properties, the casing containing a fixed first end-on 
contact (8) connected to a first terminal, and moving equipment 

including a first tube (2) that can be displaced by a drive rod (3), 
said first tube (2) being connected to a second terminal and co-operating 

with a second tube (4) to define a blast volume (5) in 
which a fixed blast piston (11) is disposed, the second tube (4) 

being extended by a blast nozzle (6), said circuit-breaker further 
including a semi-moving tubular second end-on contact (9) mounted to 

slide in the first tube (2) and pushed via its end further from the 
first contac
t (8) by a first end of a helical spring (10) abutting 
via its second end against an annular shoulder (7) inside the first 

tube (2), said circuit-breaker being characterized in that a 
temporary locking member that can be retracted by applying axial 

force connects the first tube (2) to said casing (1), when the 
contacts (8, 9) are in the engaged position. 
A circuit-breaker according to claim 1, characterized in that said 
locking member is mechanical. 
A circuit-breaker according to claim 2, characterized in that said 
locking member is constituted by a notch (12) connected to the first 

tube (2) and receiving a ball (13) urged by a compression spring (14) 
coupled to a portion fixed to the casing (1). 
A circuit-breaker according to claim 3, characterized in that the 
notch (12) is provided in the outside surface of the first tube (2). 
A circuit-breaker according to claim 3, characterized in that the 
notch (12) is provided in a tubular part (16) mounted to slide on the 

outside surface of the first tube (2) and disposed between two 
annular shoulders (17, 18) disposed on the outside surface of the 

first tube (2), a helical spring (19) being disposed between an 
abutment surface on said part (16) and the shoulder (17) that is 

closer to the contacts (8, 9).
