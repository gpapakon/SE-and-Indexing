<ABSTRACT>
An impedance detector, in particular for radiosonde 
operation. The detector comprises a substrate 

made of an insulating material, onto which 
substrate the electrode and contact patterns 

necessary for the formation and connecting of 
the detector impedance have been applied. Between 

the detector impedance electrodes, there is 
an active film, whose impedance values are a 

function of the physical quantity measured by means 
of the detector. The substrate of the detector is an 

oblong core filament of an 
insulating material, onto and around which core 

filament said electrodes and said active 
insulating film have been applied. Also, a 

novel process is described for the manufacture of 
said impedance detector.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention concerns a capacitive humidity detector, in particular for radiosonde
operation, which detector comprises a substrate made of an insulating material, onto
which substrate are applied the electrode and contact patterns necessary for the
formation and connecting of the detector capacitance. Between the detector
capacitance electrodes there is an insulating and active film, whose electrical
permittivity is a function of the amount of water absorbed by the active film.The invention concerns a process for the manufacture of such an impedance detector.In the prior art, a number of different electrically detected temperature and humidity
detectors are known whose impedance changes as a function of the quantity to be
measured. Such humidity detectors are known, e.g., from the US Patents Nos.
3,168,829 and 3,350,941 and from the applicant's Finnish Patent No. 48,229.The FI Patent No. 48,229 is related to the prior art concerned in the present
invention, in which patent a capacitive humidity detector is described in which the
dielectric insulating material is a polymer film whose permittivity is a function of the
amount of water absorbed by the polymer film.As is known in the prior art, also for measurement of temperature, capacitive
detectors are used, which are usually based on the fact that the permittivity of the
insulating material between the capacitor plates is dependent on the temperature, in
which case the capacitance detected from the terminals of the detector also depends
on the temperature. In the detectors described above and also in other detectors based on change in
impedance, undesirable phenomena occur, which include freezing and wetting of
detectors, radiation error, slowness of the detectors, and hysteresis.In order to solve the problems discussed above, it is known from the prior art to
provide said detectors with various mechanical shields. Also, attempts have been
made to prevent the problems by providing the detectors with heating. Heated
detectors require precise measurement of the temperature, which, for its part,
produces problems of its own.With respect to the most recent development work carried out by the applicant,
related to and closely connected with the present invention, reference is made to the
following FI Patent Applications: No. 921449 (filed April 1, 1992), No. 933701
(filed August 23, 1993) and No. 933702 (filed August 23, 1993). The constructions
and methods described in said applications can, where applicable, also be used in
combination with the present
