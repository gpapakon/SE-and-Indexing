<ABSTRACT>
Methods for preparing metallurgical powders containing an organic lubricant are provided. The powders are prepared by wetting a dry admixture of an iron-based powder, at least one alloying powder, and a first organic lubricant with an organic binding agent that is preferably dissolved or dispersed in a solvent. After removal of the solvent, the dried powder composition is admixed with a second organic lubricant.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to improved methods
for preparing metallurgical powder compositions of the kind
containing an organic lubricant. More specifically, the
methods relate to the preparation of powder compositions
which contain an iron-based powder, an alloying powder, a
binding agent, and an organic lubricant where the lubricant
is incorporated into the composition in two steps, providing
improved powder characteristics and enabling the adjustment
of the apparent density of the powder.In the art of powder metallurgy, iron or steel
powders are often admixed with one or more alloying
elements, also in particulate form, followed by compaction
and sintering. Because of their very fine size, these
alloying powders are susceptible to the separatory phenomena
known as dusting and segregation, but the incorporation of
binding agents into the compositions reduces these problems,
enhancing the homogeneity of the composition and therefore
of the final sintered part. See, for example, U.S. Pat. No.
4,834,800 to Semel and U.S. Pat. No. 4,483,905 to Engstrom.Metal powder compositions are also generally
provided with a lubricant, such as a metal stearate, a
paraffin, or a synthetic wax, in order to facilitate
ejection of the compacted component from the die. The 
friction forces that must be overcome in order to remove a
compacted part from the die, which generally increase with
the pressure used to compact the part, are measured as the
"stripping" and "sliding" pressures. The lubricants reduce
these pressures.Hundreds of thousands of tons of iron and steel
powders worldwide are mixed each year and most of it,
probably upwards of 95%, is done without the use of binders
or, for that matter, even any consideration of the use of
such. The addition of lubricants to these mixes is simple
even to the point of being completely artless. Although
lubricant type and content are important issues, method of
addition is not. Accordingly, the lubricants are added
directly along with the balance of the admix ingredients.With the advent of bonding to prevent segregation
and dusting and, particularly, with the use of solid binders
as dispersed from solvent solutions, the method of lubricant
addition and, more specifically, the timing of the addition
relative to that of the binder additions has along with the
issues of type and content also become an important issue.In the very early development of the bonding
technology, the aim was to achieve identically the same
powder properties in a bonded mix as would be observed in
the
