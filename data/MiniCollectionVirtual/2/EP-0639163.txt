<ABSTRACT>
The patent claims concern a method for a more efficient "wet combustion" of COD-containing effluents from industrial processes and municipal plants and for a more efficient COD-reduction by enzymes in aerobic and anaerobic biological cleaning processes and for same sorts of effluents. The method implies a strong increase of the reaction speed between added oxygen and the elements in the liquid to be oxidized through so-called "Turbo Oxidation", which implies that the liquid is submitted to strong movements and turbulence during several circulations within one or more liquid circuits during continuous addition of oxygen. By the same method, COD reduction by enzymes can also be made more effective. The single circuit is placed in connection to and communicates liquid-wise with a pressurized reaction tank, from where the developed reaction gases are continuously let out. Into the circuits and the attached reaction tank is continuously fed controlled quantities of the liquid to be oxidized together with proportionate quantities of oxygen or enzymes. Concurrently, the outlets of respectively oxidized liquid and evolved gases are controlled automatically. Out-going, oxidized liquid can be heat exchanged against in-going liquid, and the hot gases from the reaction tank can be used for external, heating purposes.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention concerns an apparatus for a better wet oxidation of COD-containing 
liquids from industry and other activities containing 
chemical compounds which can be oxidized. This invention is especially suitable in combination with 2 previous 
patent applications from the same inventor, namely 
Norwegian Patent Application No. 884546, with title: 
"Method for production of pulp fro m plant and/or wood 
fibres and/or delignification of secondary fibres", and Norwegian Patent Application No. 882815, titled: "Method 
for production of pulp and delignification, bleaching, 
de-inking and washing of cellulose fibres and apparatus 
for carrying out the method". Both patent appications deal partly with oxidation or lignin containing 
cellulosic materials in fibre suspensions. This invention concerns especially oxidation of dissolved sugar or lignocellulosic materials, 
and is based on production experiences from the two abovementioned 
inventions. The apparatus is however also applicable for wet oxidation of other, COD-containing 
liquids in other connections, hereunder also biological, 
aerobic COD-reduction with activated sludge. The apparatus is also applicable for anaerobic, biological COD-reduction 
with activated sludge, but then with shut off supply of oxygen and/or 
air. Wet oxidation of oxidizable compounds in aqueous solutions is well known as 
chemical reaction. Already in 1960, descriptions of fullscale , technical plants for 
process industry and municipal installations were published. During the 
last 20-30 years more such plants have also been built, especially in 
USA and Europe. The experience however from these plants is that they are expensive, 
both in buying and operation. The wet oxidation process has therefore  
 
not found a widespread application appropriate to the demand, 
especially after the escalated environmental demands of the latter 
years. This fact is based on the following 4 conditions: 
1. The effluents to be oxidized are frequently very diluted, having a 
low COD-content, substantially below 20 g COD/l. 
A very diluted effluent requires large heat quantities for heating 
to the required reaction temperature, in most cases exceeding 150Â°C. A prerequisite for an economical wet oxidation is that the liquid 
preferably contains from 20 to 50 g COD/l liquid. 2. Wet oxidation of industrial and municipal effluents requires frequently 
large quantities of oxygen, a fact which implies relatively 
high operational costs, regardless if the oxygen is added in a pure 
form or in

<CLAIMS>
An apparatus for a more efficient wet oxidation of COD-containing liquids, especially COD-containing 
industrial and municipal effluents and a more efficient COD-reduction 

by enzymes in aerobic and anaerobic plants by increasing the reaction 
speed and reducing the reaction- and retention time within a closed 

and pressurized reaction apparatus, which with shorter reaction- and 
retention times can be correspondingly diminished, and which operates 

with lower system pressures because oxygen, and/or air and evolved 
gases flow continuously through the apparatus, in which the liquid to 

be oxidized is submitted to "Turbo Oxidation", which consists in 
putting the liquid into strong, rotating, streaming and turbulent 

movements within the pressurized apparatus, whereby the accessability 
between the compounds to react chemically with each other is 

substantially increased, the apparatus being
characterized in that
 one or more circuits (5), each consisting of a 
special pump (9), a circulation pipe in which are situated a 

regulation valve (10) and devices for oxygen and/or enzymes inlet (6) 
and another inlet (25) for steam,
 
communicate liquid-wise with a separate reaction tank (11) through an 

outlet pipe (12) from the circuit and an inlet pipe (13) into the 
circuit, and
 
each circuit having an inlet pipe (1) for continuous afflux of liquid 

to be treated, and an outlet pipe (12) for continuous discharge, the 
latter lea
ding into
 
the reaction tank (11), which has a separate outlet (19) for 

continuous discharge of liquid and a separate outlet (18) for 
continuous discharge of gases. 
An apparatus as claimed in claim 1,
characterized in that
 the regulation valve (10) in the circuit (5) is 
situated between the outlet (12) of the circuit and the inlet (13) to 

the circuit from the reaction tank. 
An apparatus as claimed in claim 1 and 2,
characterized in that
 the reaction tank (11) may be equipped with 
partition walls (14), acting as separating overflows between the 

respective circuits.  
 
An apparatus as claimed in claims 1, 2 and 3,
characterized in that
 the apparatus is equipped with adequate 
instrumentation (3) (16) (22), securing a controlled quantity of 

inflow of liquid into the apparatus (3), controlled outlet of evolved 
gases, related to a constant liquid level in the reaction tank (16), 

and a controlled outlet of liquid from the apparatus, related to the 
internal pressure of the apparatus (22). 
An apparatus as claimed in claims 1, 2, 3 and 4,
characterized in that
 a heat exchanger (20) may be installed in the 
liquid outlet pipe (19) from the reaction tank (11) before the liquid 

leaves the apparatus through the outlet valve (21).
