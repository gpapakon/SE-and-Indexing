<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to an installation channel (installation duct) (3) for laying electrical cables, having a base (32) and two side walls (33, 34) which are integrally connected to this base (32). On their free edges, the side walls (33, 34) have wall regions (1, 2) which are directed such that they run longitudinally at right angles to the channel interior (31) and are designed as mounting points for installation links, cable brackets or similar installation aids. The invention is regarded as being that the wall regions (1, 2) have bends (11, 12), which run such they converge towards one another, at their free ends into the cable interior space (31). The installation brackets (4), in contrast, have forked-shaped offsets (41, 42), which point away from one another in a divergent manner, at their free ends. The fork openings (411, 412) of these fork-shaped offsets (41, 42) point towards the bends (11, 12) and their unobstructed fork width corresponds to the cross-sectional dimensions of the bends (11, 12).

Installation trunking for the installation of electrical leads with a base and two single-piece 
side walls which are connected with this base, the free edges of these side walls 

having wall areas along the whole length at a right angle to the trunking interior, the wall 
areas being formed in sucha way as to provide a receptacle for installation bridges, lead 

clips or similar installation aids, characterised in that the wall areas (1,2) have angled 
parts (11,12) on their free ends which converge towards the trunking interior (31), and 

that the installation clips (4) have fork-shaped bends (41,42) diverging from each other 
on their free ends, the forked openings (411, 412) of which are directed towards the 

angled parts (11,12), and the nominal fork width of which corresponds to the cross-sectional 
dimensions of the angled parts (11,12). 
Installation trunking in accordance with Claim 1, characterised in that the installation clips 

(4) have a reinforcement bead (43) which runs axially, which ends at the specified 
distance (A) from the bends (41, 42). 
Installation trunking in accordance with Claim 1, characterised in that the fork blades 
(413, 414, 415, 416) which form the fork-shaped bends (41,42) are of different lengths. 
Installation trunking in accordance with Claim 3, characterised in that the outer fork 
blades (413, 415) are shorter than the inner fork blades (414, 416).
