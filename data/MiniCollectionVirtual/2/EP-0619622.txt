<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to microwave power divider 
circuity, and more particularly to monopulse power divider 
networks suitable for use in radar antenna arrays. For an antenna array, the RF energy needed to excite 
the individual radiating elements originates from a single 
transmitter. The energy is then distributed to all the 
elements through the antenna feed network. To have the 
antenna operate across a wide instantaneous bandwidth, the 
feed network often uses a corporate architecture with 
matched four port power dividers (one port is terminated in 
a matched load) performing the RF power distribution. To perform monopulse operation, the feeding of the 
array is typically split in halves (or quadrants), and then 
the halves (or quadrants) are combined together with a 
network of Magic-Tee couplers, as shown in FIG. 1. This 
network will provide an amplitude distribution across the 
array. However, the Magic-Tee couplers will create a 180 
degree phase change between the two halves of the array at 
the difference port while maintaining equal phase for the 
sum port excitation. The results are two entirely different 
radiation patterns generated by the array. These two 
patterns are then used by the radar for monopulse tracking. 
The problem with this approach is that the optimal amplitude  
 
distribution required to generate a sum pattern with 
low sidelobes is very different from that required for low 
difference pattern sidelobes. Conventional monopulse and 
corporate feed networks can yield only one amplitude 
distribution. One approach to realize separate sum and difference 
distributions is to have corresponding elements across the 
halves of the array connected together with Magic-Tee couplers 
fed by a separate sum feed network and difference 
feed network. Unfortunately this approach requires a 
formidable amount of excess transmission lines to connect 
all the components and thus resulting in depth and weight 
penalties. Conventional monopulse networks are limited to two and 
four output ports. Their sum and difference channels 
excite only RF identical amplitude distributions with the 
only difference being phase reversal between ports. See, 
M. Skolnik, Introduction to Radar Systems, 1980, at pages 
160-167. Ladder feeds have wide tunable frequency bandwidth 
and narrow instantaneous bandwidth, and require a 
number of different precision couplers. These couplers 
would either be machined slots in waveguide (expensive, 
bulky and bandwidth limited) or proximity couplers in 
stripline
