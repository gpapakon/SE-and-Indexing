<DESCRIPTION>
The invention concerns preparations for the external
application of agents with antiseptic and/or wound healing
promoting properties. The preparations are specifically
applied to wounds, skin, mucous membranes and mucosa-like
unkeratinized epithelial tissues of humans and animals.A plurality of different antibiotic and antiseptic agents are
known for the topical treatment of infectious maladies. A
decisive disadvantage of antibiotic agents is that the
infecting bacteria show primary resistances, and can acquire
secondary resistances, against these agents. Further,
antibiotics quite often lead to patient sensibilisation. The
use of antiseptics such as povidone iodine, also known as
polyvidone iodine or PVP iodine, i.e. the poly(1-vinyl-2-pyrrolidin-2-one)-iodine
complex, can prevent resistances.
Antiseptic agents are also much more rarely allergenic as
compared to antibiotics.In the scientific literature liposomes have quite often been
disclosed as drug carriers. A non-exhaustive list comprises
the following, more recent publications:

Netherlands, has reported on animal experiments with silver
sulphadiazine, a chemotherapeutic agent, encapsulated in
liposomes and applied to experimental wounds. The results
appear to show agent enrichment at the wound bottom and
reduced silver resorption, compared with customary silver
sulphadiazine ointments.However, although a lot of attention has been paid for quite
some time to liposomes as drug carriers, there appears to be
no prior art relating to liposomes as carriers of antiseptic
or wound healing promoting agents for external applications. An object of
