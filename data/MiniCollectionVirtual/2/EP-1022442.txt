<ABSTRACT>
An intake-air quantity control apparatus for an
internal combustion engine with a variable valve timing

system associated with at least an intake valve,
comprises a control unit controlling an intake-air

quantity of air entering the internal combustion engine
based on at least one of an intake valve open timing and

an intake valve closure timing of the intake valve. The
control unit determines a desired internal pressure in

an intake-air passage based on a predetermined operating
parameter, and detecting an operation delay-time

fluctuation rate for at least the intake valve. A
desired intake-air quantity is arithmetically

calculated on the basis of engine operating conditions.
The control unit includes a compensation section which

compensates for the desired internal pressure based on
at least one of the operation delay-time fluctuation rate

and the desired intake-air quantity to produce a
compensated internal pressure. A throttle opening is

controlled depending on both the compensated internal
pressure and the desired intake-air quantity. Also, the

intake valve open timing and the intake valve closure
timing are controlled depending on both the compensated

internal pressure and the desired intake-air quantity.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an intake-air quantity control apparatus for an internal
combustion engine with a variable valve timing system associated with at least an intake
valve comprising: a control unit for controlling an intake-air quantity of air entering the
internal combustion engine on the basis of at least one of an intake valve opening timing
and an intake valve closure timing of the intake valve. Furthermore, the present
invention also relates to a method for controlling an intake air quantity entering each of
engine cylinders for a computer-controlled internal combustion engine with a variable
valve timing system associated with at least an intake valve located at each of the engine
cylinders and to an electronically-controlled internal combustion engine with a variable
valve timing system associated with at least an intake valve.From prior art document US 4,995,351 a valve timing control apparatus for an internal
combustion engine capable of controlling the opening and closing timing of the intake
and exhaust valves with a high degree of preciseness is known. The valve timing control
apparatus includes a pressure sensor for sensing the internal pressure in an engine
cylinder, a crank angle sensor for sensing the crank angle of the engine, a valve timing
detector for detecting the opening and closing timing of the intake and exhaust valves
from the sensed cylinder internal pressure and the sensed engine crank angle.
Moreover, a valve timing detecting means is provided for detecting the opening and
closing timing of the intake and exhaust valve from the output signal of the cylinder
internal pressure supervisory means. In this regard, the cylinder internal pressure
supervisory means also acts as a disabling means disabling the operation of the valve
timing detecting means during combustion periods of the engine. A comparison means
provided for comparing the opening and closing timing of the intake and exhaust valves
as detected by the valve timing detecting means with a predetermined valve opening and
closing timing as read from a basic value timing map, calculates deviation therebetween
and sends them to the valve timing control means. The valve timing control means
controls the operation of the engine cylinder in a feedback manner so that the actual
opening and closing of the intake and exhaust valves take place at prescribed timings. From US 5,713, 317 a method and an apparatus for controlling a continuously variable
valve timing mechanism of an internal combustion engine to
