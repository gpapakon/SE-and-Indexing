<ABSTRACT>
A method of making polymeric particles by 
forming a suspension of ethylenically unsaturated 

monomer droplets in water, the water containing a 
particulate suspension agent, the monomer droplets 

containing a nonreactive hydrophobic compound where the 
water solubility of the nonreactive compound is less 

than that of the monomer and polymerizing the monomer 
droplets.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a method for making
particles. More particularly, it relates to a method
of making uniformly-sized polymeric particles, with a
very low population of oversized particles.It is known that particles can be made by a
variety of in situ polymerization techniques such as
suspension polymerization or limited coalescence (LC)
polymerization as well as crushing or grinding of solid
polymer samples, spray drying, evaporation of solvent
from a dispersion of a polymer solution, etc. In order
to obtain a narrow particle size distribution of useful
product, all of these techniques require extensive
sorting and classification operations that are costly,
time-consuming and cause substantial reductions in
yield. LC polymerization frequently provides nearly
monodisperse particle size distributions. However,
even with LC polymerization, the particle size
distribution of polymer particles is not ideal. In
particular, it is commonly observed that a substantial
population of oversized particles is formed. Further,
particularly when larger particles are being made, an
appreciable amount of coagulum results. The presence
of these materials introduces the necessity for complex
processing steps in manufacturing such as, filtration,
sieving, cyclone separation and the like.LC polymerization is a term referring to a
specific kind of suspension polymerization process.
"Suspension polymerization" refers to a process in
which a polymerizable liquid is dispersed as droplets
in a continuous aqueous medium and polymerized under
continuous agitation. Normally, this process is carried out in the
presence of a "granulating agent", such as a lyophilic
polymer (starch, natural gums, polyvinyl alcohol or the
like) or an insoluble fine powder such as calcium
phosphate. These granulating agents help to obtain a
dispersion of droplets of the polymerizable liquid but
do not provide sufficient stabilization of the
dispersion so that the dispersed droplets are stable in
the absence of agitation. Therefore, in this method,
it is necessary to carry out the polymerization under
continuous mechanical agitation, since otherwise
extensive coalescence of the droplets will occur, with
separation of a bulk phase of the water immiscible,
polymerizable material. Because this process depends
on the details of the shear field in the reactor, and
on the changing viscosity of the polymerizing dispersed
phase, it is difficult to control reproducibly, is not
readily scalable, and gives broad particle size
distribution (PSD). In addition,
