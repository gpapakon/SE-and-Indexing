<ABSTRACT>
In the recognition phase, the signal from a sensor (10) is processed to obtain parameters which are compared with those stored in a dictionary (16) in the training phase in order to recognise the vocal structures uttered by the user in a noisy environment. The obtaining of the said parameters during the training and recognition phases includes the forming of digital frames (S(n)) of predetermined length on the basis of the signal from the sensor, the transforming of each frame from the time domain to the frequency domain to obtain a spectrum X(i), and the applying of an inverse transformation, from the frequency domain to the time domain, to the quantity ¦X(i)¦
<
 gamma 
>
, where ¦X(i)¦ represents the modulus of the spectrum and gamma  represents an appropriate exponent.

A speech processing method comprising a
learning phase during which a signal originating from a

sensor (10) is processed to obtain parameters which
represent voice structures uttered by a user in a mildly

noisy environment and which are stored in a dictionary
(16), and a recognition phase during which the signal

originating from the sensor (10) is processed to obtain
parameters which are compared with those stored in the

dictionary (16) so as to recognize the voice structures
uttered by the user in a noisy environment, wherein the

obtaining of the said parameters during the learning and
recognition phases includes the formation of digital

frames (S(n)) of predetermined length from the signal

originating from the sensor, the transformation of each
frame from the time domain to the frequency domain to

obtain a spectrum X(i), and the application of an inverse
transformation, from the frequency domain to the time

domain, to a magnitude calculated from the spectrum X(i),

parameter set affording the closest correspondence with
