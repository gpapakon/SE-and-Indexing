<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a system for controlling a 
multi-cylinder variable displacement internal combustion 
engine so as to avoid excessive torque excursions during 
transitions from one effective displacement to another. Automotive vehicle designers and manufacturers have 
realised for years that it is possible to obtain increased 
fuel efficiency if an engine can be operated on less than 
the full complement of cylinders during certain running 
conditions. Accordingly, at low speed, low load operation, 
it is possible to save fuel if the engine can be run on four 
instead of eight cylinders or three, instead of six 
cylinders. In fact, one manufacturer offered a 4-6-8 
variable displacement engine several years ago, and Ford 
Motor Company designed a 6-cylinder engine capable of 
operation on only three cylinders which, although never 
released for production, was developed to a highly refined 
state. Unfortunately, both of the aforementioned engines 
suffered from deficiencies associated with their control 
strategies. Specifically, customer acceptance of the engine 
system actually in production was unsatisfactory because the 
powertrain tended to "hunt" or shift frequently between the 
various cylinder operating modes. In other words, the 
engine would shift from four to eight cylinder operation 
frequently, while producing noticeable torque excursions. 
This had the undesirable effect of causing the driver to 
perceive excessive changes in transmission gear in the 
nature of downshifting or upshifting. Another drawback to 
prior art systems resided in the fact that the engine's 
torque response corresponding to a given change in the 
accelerator pedal position varied quite widely with the 
number of cylinders actually in operation. For example, 
when the engine was in eight-cylinder operation, a given 
change in the accelerator pedal position would produce a  
 
certain change in engine torque output at any particular 
engine speed. However, when the engine was operated at less 
than the total number of cylinders, e.g., 4 or 6 cylinders, 
for the same change in accelerator pedal position a much 
reduced torque response was available. As a result, the 
vehicles felt sluggish and non-responsive to driver input. It is an object of the present invention to provide a 
system for operating the engine's air throttle, spark timing 
and, in the case of automatic transmission vehicles, the 
torque converter clutch, such that torque excursions 
occasioned by changes in the number of cylinders being 
opera
