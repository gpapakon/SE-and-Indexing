<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a detector amplifier with multiple inputs (E1-E3) and with a single output (S) in particular for a guarding system. According to the invention, at least two stages (D, A1, A2) each comprise at least one input suitable for receiving an external signal. The various stages (D, A1, A2, A3) are fed, in series, by a single power supply line (V, M) with low-voltage direct current serving as a support for alternating signals. Applications: high-gain circuit with very low current consumption for electronic devices which have to be powered continuously.
