<ABSTRACT>
A method and system for the efficient distribution of 
electronic mail items within a distributed data processing 

system having multiple users enrolled therein wherein each user 
utilizes a computer or terminal device having a unique address. 

After selecting an individual electronic mail item for 
distribution an intuitive graphic representation of a group of 

unique addresses is displayed within a user's terminal device. 
The intuitive graphic representation may take one of several 

forms including a two or three dimensional graphic 
representation of an office floor plan which identifies the 

occupants of each office, or a photographic image of one or 
more users. In response to a graphic selection by the user of 

a particular graphic representation, or portion thereof, an 
identified electronic mail item is then automatically 

distributed to the user whose unique address is associated with 
that graphic representation or portion thereof. In one 

embodiment an electronic mail item is displayed as a miniature 
graphic representation or "icon" and is thereafter 

automatically distributed in response to a relocation of that 
icon to a position overlying the graphic representation or 

portion thereof, utilizing well known "drag and drop" 
techniques.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates in general to an improved 
data processing system and in particular to an improved method 
and system for efficiently distributing electronic mail items 
within a distributed data processing system. Still more 
particularly, the present invention relates to an improved 
method and system for graphically distributing electronic mail 
items within a distributed data processing system. In the modern office environment electronic mail is 
rapidly supplanting traditional forms of communication. Files, 
notes, meeting notices, message and documents are often sent 
from one user to another user within a distributed data 
processing system in ever increasing numbers as managers 
attempt to decrease the amount of so-called "float" associated 
with traditional mail systems. While modern electronic mail 
systems are increasingly accepted by users familiar with 
computer technology, the number of users having only minimal 
computer expertise being exposed to such systems is also 
increasing. While users familiar with electronic mail systems are 
familiar with user identifications, distribution lists, network 
nodes, gateways, call-up services, and the like, an 
inexperienced computer user is often confused by the complexity 
of such systems. In a typical electronic mail environment, the 
address to which a note, message or document is to be 
transmitted is typically a combination of an identification of  
 
a particular user and an identification of a particular system 
or node within a system. Thus, a user wishing to send a note 
or message utilizing electronic mail must know or have 
available the destination address for each prospective 
addressee, a sometimes complex and burdensome aspect of these 
systems. Several techniques have been proposed for minimizing the 
complexity of addressing electronic mail items including 
systems which permit the utilization of so-called "nicknames" 
wherein a user enters a user identification and system 
identification for those individuals who are frequently 
addressed by that user and assigns a simple "nickname" which 
corresponds to that destination address. Thereafter, the user 
may address a note or message utilizing the electronic mail 
system to that particular user by simply entering the 
"nickname" of that user. While this approach does minimize 
some of the complexity of transmitting an electronic mail item 
throughout a distributed data processing system, it is still 
necessary that the user obtain the correct user identification 
and
