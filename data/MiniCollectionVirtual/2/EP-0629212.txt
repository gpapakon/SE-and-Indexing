<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to new peptide derivatives of 
the general formula (I), 
A-Xaa-Arg-H 
wherein 
Arepresents a D- or L-isochroman-1-carbonyl, 
D- or L-isochroman-3-carbonyl group, furthermore 
an acyl group of the general formula 
D- or DL-A'-CH(OH)-CO, 
wherein 
A'represents a phenyl, benzyl, 1-naphthyl, 
1-naphthylmethyl, 2-naphthyl, 
2-naphthylmethyl, 9-fluorenyl, benzhydryl, 
cyclohexyl, cyclohexylmethyl, 
2-pyridyl, 3-pyridyl or 4-pyridyl 
group, and Xaarepresents an L-prolyl or an L-pipecolinic 
acid residue, and Arg-Hstands for an L-arginine aldehyde,  
their acid addition salts formed with an organic or inorganic 
acid and pharmaceutical compositions containing 
the sane. [The abbreviation of the L-arginine residue as  
 
Arg is in accordance with the prior art, e. g. Biochem. 
J. 126, 773 (1972); Biochemistry 14, 449 (1975)]. The invention furthermore relates to a process 
for preparing the new peptide derivatives of the general 
formula (I) and pharmaceutical compositions containing 
these compounds. The compounds of the invention have valuable 
therapeutic, particularly anticoagulant properties. Preferred representatives of the compounds having 
the formula (I) are those described in the Examples. Particularly preferred representatives of the 
compounds according to the invention are the following 
derivatives: 
3-cyclohexyl-D-lactyl-L-prolyl-L-arginine aldehyde 
hemisulfate; 3,3-diphenyl-D-lactyl-L-prolyl-L-arginine aldehyde 
hemisulfate; D-2-cyclohexyl-2-hydroxyacetyl-L-prolyl-L-arginine 
aldehyde hemisulfate; D-2-(1-naphthyl)-2-hydroxyacetyl-L-prolyl-L-arginine 
aldehyde hemisulfate; D-2-(2-naphthyl)-2-hydroxyacetyl-L-prolyl-L-arginine 
aldehyde hemisulfate. It is known that the aldehyde, derived from the tripeptide 
D-phenylalanyl-L-prolyl-L-arginine (Hungarian 
patent specification No. 169,870 and U.S. patent specification 
No. 4,399,065), the trifluoromethyl-ketone [Neises  
 
and Tarnus: Thrombos Haemostas 65, 1290 (1991)], and the 
boro-arginine [Kettner et al.: J. Biol. Chem. 265, 18289 
(1990)] are potent anticoagulants exerting activity both 
in vitro and in vivo. However, these compounds are rather 
unstable and are converted in neutral aqueous solution to 
inactive products [Bajusz et al.: J. Med. Chem. 33, 1729 
(1990)]. Further active tripeptide derivatives were prepared 
by acylating [U.S. patent specification No. 4,478,475 and 
Kettner et al.: J. Biol. Chem. 265, 18289 (1990)] or alkylating 
(U. S. patent specification No. 4,703,036) the 
D-phenylalanine moiety, or by
