<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a high frequency amplifier, and
more specifically to a high frequency amplifier having a desired band
width, for use in a tuner circuit for all optical communication system,
radio communication system, a television receiver, and the like.With advance of optical transmission technology, research is now
being conducted for a high speed optical transmission system using an
optical device of a long wave band and a single mode fiber, which enable
a large amount of long distance transmission. In particular, in order to
realize a wide band information communication network for giving a
variety of communication services including images, data and audio, it is
desired to speed up and stabilize the above mentioned optical transmission
system. In addition, a basic transmission line or truck used in this wide
band information communication network is required to have a channel
capacity of a few gigabits per second in the case of a time division
multiplexed transmission line, and optical transmitter/receiver apparatuses
included in the optical transmission system are required to have a wide
band and a high speed operation. A fundamental function, which should be possessed by the optical
transmitter/receiver apparatuses, can be basically divided into three "R"s,
namely, a reshaping by an equalizing amplification, a retiming and a
regeneration. Here, the retiming means to a timing signal extraction
function for extracting from a received data signal a timing signal in
synchronism with a transmission channel data rate, and for supplying the
extracted timing signal to an identification circuit and a multiplexing
terminal.In tuners used in mobile communication instruments such as
portable telephone and in television receivers included in domestic
electronic instruments, on the other hand, there is a large demand for
miniaturization, low power consumption and low cost. Under this
circumstance, efforts are being made for implementing a high frequency
circuit for these instruments on an integrated circuit.In the optical transmitter/receiver apparatuses and tuners as
mentioned above, it is a matter of course that a wide band amplification
circuit is significant as one constituent, but amplification circuits having a
relative narrow band width, used in an intermediate frequency circuit, for
amplifying only a signal within a desired band width, are also a significant
constituent.Referring to Figure 1, there is shown an example of an ordinary
conventional high frequency circuit used in a timing
