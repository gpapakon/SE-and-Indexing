<ABSTRACT>
A lubricant composition suitable for fuel injected two-stroke cycle engines includes 
an oil of lubricating viscosity, an amount, sufficient to reduce or prevent piston scuffing, of 

a mixture of(A) at least one phenol selected from (A-1) an aminophenol and (A-2) a reaction 
product of a nitrophenol and an amino compound, and (B) at least one Mannich dispersant, 

amine dispersant, nitrogen-containing carboxylic dispersant, or ester dispersant. 
The composition further includes an amount, sufficient to reduce degradation of the lubricant 

composition upon exposure to oxygen or oxides of nitrogen, of a nitrogen-containing 
inhibitor, a hindered phenol inhibitor, or a sulfur-containing organic inhibitor.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to lubricant compositions
useful in direct fuel injected crankcase-scavenged two-stroke cycle
engines.Over the past several decades the use of spark-ignited
two-cycle (two-stroke) internal combustion engines
has steadily increased. They are presently found in power
lawn mowers and other power-operated garden equipment,
power chain saws, pumps, electrical generators, marine
outboard engines, snowmobiles, motorcycles and the like.The increasing use of two-stroke cycle engines
coupled with increasing severity of the conditions in which
they have operated has led to an increased demand for oils
to adequately lubricate such engines. Among the problems
associated with two-stroke cycle engines is piston lubricity,
scuffing or scoring. This condition is generally controlled
by adding relatively high viscosity oils (greater
than or equal to 100 centistokes (cSt) at 40°C) or bright
stock. The higher viscosity oils and bright stock act to
increase viscosity and prevent piston seizure. A problem
associated with the use of these materials is deposit or
varnish formation in the combustion chamber which may lead
to preignition. High molecular weight polymers may be used
to replace some or all of bright stock in two-stroke cycle
engines. The polymer acts to increase viscosity and
prevent piston seizure. The problem associated with the
use of bright stock or high viscosity oils or high molecular
weight polymers is that the products tend to cause
fouling of the spark plug in a two-stroke cycle engine. Aminophenols are useful in two-stroke cycle
engines. U.S. Patents 4,320,020 and 4,320,021 issued to
Lange, relate to aminophenols and their use in lubricants.
Aminophenols have been used in combination with dispersants
and detergents. U.S. Patents 4,100,082 and 4,200,545
relate to aminophenols used in combination with neutral or
basic metal salts and amine dispersants in two-stroke cycle
lubricants. U.S. Patent 4,379,065 issued to Lange relates
to aminophenols used in combination with ashless ester
dispersants. U.S. Patent 4,425,138 relates to aminophenols
used in lubricant-fuel mixtures for two-stroke cycle
engines.U.S. Patents 4,663,063 and 4,724,091 issued to
Davis relate to a combination of an alkyl phenol and an
amino compound in two-stroke cycle engines. The former
relates to an alkyl phenol together with an amino compound
other than an aminophenol. The latter relates to an alkyl
phenol together with an aminophenol.The unique problems and techniques associated

Use of a lubricant composition comprising:

at least one oil of lubricating viscosity
an amount, sufficient to reduce or prevent piston scuffing, of a
mixture of


(A) at least one phenol selected from

(A-1) an aminophenol and
(A-2) a reaction product of a nitrophenol and an amino
compound; and
(B) at least one non-ash-forming dispersant selected
from a Mannich dispersant, amine dispersant, nitrogen-containing

carboxylic dispersant, or ester dispersant;
said composition further comprising:
(C) an aromatic amine inhibitor;

to reduce or prevent piston scuffing in a direct fuel injected
crankcase-scavenged two-stroke cycle engine.
Use according to claim 1, wherein the phenol (A) is an aminophenol (A-1)
represented by the formula



wherein each R is independently a hydrocarbyl group of about 10 to about 400 carbon atoms;
a, b, and c are each independently integers from 1 up to 3 times the number of aromatic

nuclei present in Ar, with the proviso that the sum of a, b, and c does not exceed the
unsatisfied valences of Ar; and each Ar is independently an aromatic moiety which is substituted

by from 0 to 3 substituents selected from lower alkyl, alkoxyl,
nitro, halo, or combinations of two or more thereof.
Use according to claim 2, wherein R is derived from at least one 
polyalkene having a molecular weight from about 500 to about 2500.
Use according to claims 2 or 3, wherein Ar is a naphthalene nucleus,
benzene nucleus, or mixtures thereof, or is a plurality of aromatic nuclei linked

through at least one bridging linkage.
Use according to any of the preceding claims wherein the dispersant (B)
is the reaction product of a polyamine and a succinic acylating agent.
Use according to any of the preceding claims wherein the oil of
lubricating viscosity is free of oils having a viscosity greater than or equal to 200

cSt at 40°C.
Use according to any of the preceding claims wherein the composition
contains up to 3 percent by weight bright stock.
Use according to any of the preceding claims wherein the amount of the
phenol (A) is from 0.05 to 30 percent by weight of the composition, the amount

of the dispersant (B) is from 0.05 to 30 percent by weight of the composition,
and the amount of the inhibitor (C) is from 0.01 to 10 percent by weight of the

composition.
Use according to any preceding claim wherein the amount of the
inhibitor (C) is from 0.05 to 5% by weight of the composition.
