<ABSTRACT>
A support device for a recovery vehicle consists of two legs (13) which are arranged near to the side edge of the vehicle and can be pivoted downwards out of a position of transport into a supporting position and have supporting plates (16). In order to provide a support device which is lightweight but nevertheless effective in both towing directions, can also be retracted easily and is easily accessible, the supporting plates (16) are connected to the legs (13) so as to be capable of pivoting about a horizontal axis (30) and about a vertical axis (31), and both supporting plates (16) can be connected to one another in order to form a stabilising plate.

<CLAIMS>
Supporting device for a rescue vehicle consisting of two 
legs (13) with footing plates (16) located near the lateral 

vehicle edge and capable of being swivelled from a transportation 
position down into a supporting position, 
characterized
 in 
that the footing plates (16) are connected to the legs (13) so 

as to be capable of swivelling around a horizontal (30) and a 
vertical (31) axis and in that the two footing plates (16) can 

be connected to each other to form a supporting shield. 
Supporting device as in claim 1, 
characterized
 in that 
the footing plates (16) consist of a foot plate (17) and a 

shield plate (18) which together form an obtuse angle (26), 
whereby the shield plates (18) are provided with connection 

devices (22). 
Supporting device as in claim 1, 
characterized
 in that 
an articulated bracket (15) is provided between the legs (13) 

and the footing plate (16), said bracket being connected to the 
leg (13) via a horizontal rotary axis (30) and to the footing 

plate (60) via a vertical pivot pin (31). 
Supporting device as in claim 3, 
characterized
 in that 
one end of a strut (19) attacks at the articulated bracket (15) 

on a first attachment loop (32), eccentrically in relation to 
the vertical pivot pin (31) while its other end attacks at the 

leg (13). 
Supporting device as in claim 4, 
characterized
 in that a 
second attachment loop (33) is installed for the strut (19) and 

holds the footing plate (16) in position for horizontal force 
transfer.  

 
Supporting device as in claim 4, 
characterized
 in that a 
pressure strut (20) is installed between the vehicle body (1) 

and the shield plate (18). 
Supporting device as in claim 7, 
characterized
 in that 
the connecting devices of the footing plates (16) are supports 

(40) with a connection coupling (41) which are located in working 
position in front of the shield plates (18).
