<ABSTRACT>
A novel type of glass for a cone (3) of a display tube envelope (1), said 
glass being manufactured by recycling screen glass and cone glass of display tube 

envelopes which are to be recycled. A mixture of fragments of screen and cone glasses 
is supplemented with other glass-forming components to form a novel glass composition 

which can suitably be used in cone glass. The glass is characterized by a relatively high 
BaO and SrO content. The glass has an x-ray absorption µ of at least 6
5 cm⁻¹ at 0.6 Å.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a glass for a cone of a display tube.The invention also relates to a cone and a display tube envelope whose
cone is made from such a glass.The invention further relates to a method of manufacturing cone glass and
to a method of manufacturing a cone from such a glass.Display tubes, such as display tubes for TV receivers and computer
monitors, have an evacuated glass envelope which is built up of a screen, a cone and a
neck. The neck is the part of the envelope which contains one or more electron guns.
The screen contains, inter alia, one or more luminescent substances (phosphors). The
cone is the funnel-shaped portion of the display tube. Said three parts have different
glass compositions whose physical properties are adapted to each other. Examples of
important physical properties are: melting temperature, thermal expansion coefficient, x-ray
absorption and electrical resistivity. The screen and the cone are manufactured by
pressing a molten glass mixture and are sealed together by means of a sealing glass.
The display tube operates under a high voltage (for example 25 kV) and generates X-radiation
as a result of the electron bombardment on the glass and on the shadow mask
in front of the screen.Glasses for screens of display tubes must meet, inter alia, the following
requirements: a high x-ray absorption, no discoloration as a result of electron radiation
and x-radiation and a satisfactory meltability and processability. Said glasses preferably
contain no or little PbO in order to suppress discoloration as a result of electron
radiation. To obtain the desired x-ray absorption, said screen glass comprises 5-13
wt%
BaO and 5-13 wt% SrO and, optionally, several percent ZrO2.The cone glass must meet, inter alia, the following requirements: a high
x-ray absorption, a high electrical resistivity and a satisfactory meltability and
processability. Discoloration as a result of electron radiation is no object. Since the wall
thickness of the cone is smaller than the wall thickness of the screen, the x-ray
absorption coefficient µ (expressed in cm-1 at a wavelength of 0.6 Å) of cone glass must 
be higher than that of screen glass. In the current cone glass, µ has a value ≥ 65 cm-1
(at 0.6 Å). This high µ-value is attained by a high concentration of PbO in the cone
glass. At equal concentrations of PbO and SrO, the x-ray absorption effectiveness of
PbO is 1.5 times that of SrO. In a typical example, the current cone glass comprises
approximately 23 wt% PbO. Since the raw material is very
