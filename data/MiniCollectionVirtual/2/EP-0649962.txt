<ABSTRACT>
An overhead mounted door holder assembly (10), for 
attachment between a door jamb (14) and a door (12) to hold 

the door in an open position includes a jamb bracket (16) 
attached to the door jamb and a jamb arm (18) pivotably 

attached to the jamb bracket. A channel assembly (22) 
having a channel (23) is attached to the door. A slide 

assembly (26) is disposed within the channel and is 
pivotably connected to the jamb arm. A slide catch (38) on 

the slide assembly is provided for the door holding 
function. First and second springs (32, 33) are attached 

to the channel assembly and positioned within the channel 
and a spring mounted catch (28) is attached to the first 

and second springs. In operation, the spring mounted catch 
is pivotably positioned in the channel to engage the slide 

catch and reversibly hold the door in an open position.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates generally to door holder assemblies 
and more particularly to an overhead mounted door holder 
assembly having a low profile suitable for mounting in a 
door top inset. It is often desired to hold a door temporarily in an open 
position for convenience and safety. One commonly employed 
method of doing this uses an overhead mounted door control 
device that includes a pivoting arm attached between an 
upper portion of a door jamb and an upper part of a door. 
When the door is to be held open at an angle not exceeding 
about 110 degrees, an overhead mounted door control device 
is efficient, effective, convenient to install and 
maintain, is less subject to damage by vandalism or 
accidents and does not present a stumbling hazard. It would be very desirable to have an overhead door holder 
assembly that is durable, easy to install as an inset into 
the top of a door and replaceable with minimal effort and 
expertise. The door holder should be set to permit easy 
engagement, to hold the door against minor amounts of 
jostling contact without release and yet to still permit 
closing the door without undue effort.  
 It is desirable that such a door holder should not require 
special tools for installation or maintenance but it should 
have features that prevent its damage from violent or 
forceful door opening. The door should automatically be 
held in an open position after it is swung open a 
predetermined angle and should be easily released from its 
held open position when desired. US-A-4 750 236 discloses a typical track-type door 
hold-open device according to the preamble of claim 1. According to the present invention, there is provided a 
door holder assembly for attachment between a door jamb and 
a door, the assembly comprising means for pivotally 
attaching a jamb arm to a door; a channel assembly for 
attachment to the door and having a channel therein and 
door holding means within the channel assembly comprising 
first and second springs connected to a spring mounted 
catch pivotable relative to the channel around a pivot 
point, and a slide assembly pivotally attached to the jamb arm 
and position for longitudinal movement within the 
channel, the slide assembly having a slide piece supporting 
a hook and a wall, characterised in that the spring mounted 
catch is able to move longitudinally a limited distance 
relative to its pivot point, the wall engaging the spring 
mounted catch when the door is force fully, opened, such that the catch 
slides longitudinally,

<CLAIMS>
A door holder assembly (10) for attachment between a 
door jamb (14) and a door (12), the assembly comprising 

means for pivotally attaching a jamb arm (18) to a door; a 
channel assembly (22) for attachment to the door and having 

a channel (23) therein and door holding means (38) within 
the channel assembly (22) comprising first and second 

springs (32, 33) connected to a spring mounted catch (28) 
pivotable relative to the channel (23) around a pivot point 

(30), and a slide assembly (26) pivotally attached to the jamb 
arm (18) and positioned for longitudinal movement within 

the channel (23), the slide assembly (26) having a slide piece 
(42) supporting a hook (44) and a wall (46), characterised 

in that the spring mounted catch (28) is able to move 
longitudinally a limited distance relative to its pivot 

point (30), the wall (46) engaging the spring mounted catch 
(28) when the door is force fully opened, such that the catch (28) 

slides longitudinally, thereby distributing the force of 
the door opening to the springs (32, 33), and the pivoting movement of the catch (28) enabling the hook (44) 

to engage the holding means (38) to hinder a subsequent door 
closure. 
An assembly according to claim 1, wherein a spring 
support (24) is attached to the channel assembly (22) at a 

fixed position within the channel (23). 
An assembly according to claim 1 or 2, wherein the 
first and second springs (32, 33) are longitudinally 

positioned in the channel (23) in spaced apart relationship 
to each other, with both springs having substantially equal 

spring constants and resistance to compressive force.  
 
An assembly according to claim 1, 2 or 3, wherein the 
spring mounted catch (28) has a channel (29) with a pin 

(30) attached to the channel assembly extending through the 
channel (29) in the spring mounted catch. 
An assembly according to claim 4, wherein the first 
spring (32) is connected to the spring mounted catch (28) 

on one side of the channel (29) in the catch (28) and the 
second spring (33) is connected to the catch (28) on the 

opposite side of the channel (29), thereby permitting 
limited pivoting movement of the spring mounted catch (28) 

about the pin (30). 
An assembly according to any one of the preceding claims, wherein 
the spring mounted catch (28) has a first 

ramp (39) slidingly to engage the hook (44) of the slide 
piece as it advances toward the first and second springs 

(32, 33) and a second ramp (40) to hinder release of the 
hook (44) from the catch (28) as the slide assembly (26) is 

forced away from the first and second springs.  
 
An assembly according to any one of the preceding 
claims, wherein the first and second springs (32, 33) are 

positioned to resist compression and absorb door opening 
force as the slide assembly (26) impacts the spring mounted 

catch (28). 
A door incorporating a door holder assembly according 
to any one of the preceding claims.
