<DESCRIPTION>
Renin-inhibiting compounds are known for 
control of hypertension. Of particular interest herein 
are compounds useful as renin inhibiting agents. Renin is a proteolytic enzyme produced and 
secreted into the bloodstream by the juxtaglomerular 
cells of the kidney. In the bloodstream, renin cleaves a 
peptide bond in the serum protein angiotensinogen to 
produce a decapeptide known as angiotensin I. A second 
enzyme known as angiotensin converting enzyme, cleaves 
angiotensin I to produce the octapeptide known as 
angiotensin II. Angiotensin II is a potent pressor agent 
responsible for vasoconstriction and elevation of 
cardiovascular pressure. Attempts have been made to 
control hypertension by blocking the action of renin or 
by blocking the formation of angiotensin II in the body 
with inhibitors of angiotensin I converting enzyme. Classes of compounds published as inhibitors of 
the action of renin on angiotensinogen include renin 
antibodies, pepstatin and its analogs, phospholipids, 
angiotensinogen analogs, pro-renin related analogs and 
peptide aldehydes. A peptide isolated from actinomyces has been 
reported as an inhibitor of aspartyl proteases such as 
pepsin, cathepsin D and renin [Umezawa et al, in J. 
Antibiot. Tokyo),23, 259-262 (1970)]. This peptide, 
known as pepstatin, was found to reduce blood pressure invivo after the injection of hog renin into nephrectomized 
rats [Gross et al, Science, 175, 656 (1971)]. Pepstatin 
has the disadvantages of low solubility and of inhibiting 
acid proteases in addition to renin. Modified pepstatins 
have been synthesized in an attempt to increase the 
specificity for human renin over other physiologically 
important enzymes. While some degree of specificity has 
been achieved, this approach has led to rather high 
molecular weight hepta- and octapeptides [Boger et al, 
Nature, 303, 81 (1983)]. High molecular weight peptides 
are generally considered undesirable as drugs because 
gastrointestinal absorption is impaired and plasma 
stability is compromised. Short peptide aldehydes have been reported as 
renin inhibitors [Kokubu et al, Biochim. Biophys. Res. 
Commun., 118, 929 (1984); Castro et al, FEBS Lett., 167, 
273 (1984)], Such compounds have a reactive C-terminal 
aldehyde group and would likely be unstable in vivo. Other peptidyl compounds have been described as 
renin inhibitors. EP Appl. #128,762, published 18 
December 1984, describes dipeptide and tripeptide glyco-containing 
compounds as renin inhibitors [also see Hanson 
et al, Biochm.
