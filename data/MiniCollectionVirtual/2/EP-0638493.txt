detecting the position of works (W) by sensors and delivering the 

necessary amount of works while many works are allowed to be standby by 
automatic control wherein the parallel conveyor and a shipping apparatus 

(P) employed in the delivering apparatus for automatically transferring 
the works from a multilayer carriage to the parallel conveyor without 

resorting to the man power. The parallel conveyor system comprises one 
way conveyor (1) composed of a long conveyor (1a) and a short conveyor 

(1b) which follows the long conveyors, an opposite way conveyor (3) 
which is close to and parallel with one way conveyor, a pushing machine 

(5) disposed at the side of the short conveyor for pushing and 
transferring the works, which are transferred from the long conveyor to 

the short conveyor, to the opposite way conveyor, when the short 
conveyor stops and the closing stoppers close. The shipping apparatus 

(P) comprises a passage (4) through which a multilayer carriage (2) 
passes being formed between the one way conveyor (1) and pushing machine 

(10), a vertical hole (6) in which the multilayer carriage drop being 
formed on the passage, a platform (8) on which the multilayer carriage 

gets being vertically movable in the hole, wherein the pushing machine 
pushes the works successively on each shelf of the multilayer carriage 

toward the one way conveyor when the platform stops at the position 
corresponding to the height of each row of shelves and the one way 

conveyor stops and the platform returns to the original position so that 
the next multilayer carriage can get on the platform.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an apparatus for delivering works 
from a warehouse (hereinafter referred to as a delivering apparatus) 
using a parallel conveyor system which is effective for shipping works, 
i.e. goods such as trays for accommodating eggs from the warehouse or 
for supplying parts or components from one step to another step, etc. 
and an apparatus for shipping the works (hereinafter referred to as a 
shipping apparatus) from a carriage having vertical multilayer shelves 
(hereinafter referred to as a multilayer carriage) employed by the 
delivering apparatus to the parallel conveyor system. When goods, i.e. works such as eggs are delivered from a 
warehouse, packed bodies of the goods (trays where many goods are 
arranged lengthwise and breadthwise are lied on top of another) are 
carried on conveyors having belt conveyor, etc. are arranged alternately 
and in parallel with one another and the amount of the works to be 
supplied to the exit of the warehouse is adjusted on the conveyor so as to 
prevent the amount of the works to be shipped by trucks, etc. from being 
greater or less than the average amount. Whereupon, when the works 
are delivered into the warehouse, a multilayer carriage having vertical 
multilayer shelves is used so that the works are transferred from the 
multilayer carriage to the conveyor.  However, according to such prior art delivering apparatus using 
the parallel conveyor system, the operation speed of the conveyor is 
controlled while many works remain movably standby in a narrow place 
so as to adjust the amount of supply of the works at the exit of the 
warehouse. However, the transfer of the works from a one way 
conveyor to an opposite way conveyor which travels in the direction 
opposite to the one way conveyor requires many man power, which does 
not contribute to reduction of labor. Furthermore, if the works have 
complicated shapes such as the trays for eggs,the works are caught by 
other works, which makes it difficult to transfer the works. Although the shipping of the works from the multilayer carriage 
to the conveyor also requires man power, in view of the fact that the 
multilayer carriage is movable and unstable and the works must be 
shipped at the higher position, which leads to hard labor and inefficient 
operability. In view of the drawbacks of the prior art, it is an object of the 
invention to provide a delivering apparatus using parallel conveyor 
system and a shipping apparatus employed by the delivering apparatus 
capable of

<CLAIMS>
A delivering apparatus comprising a parallel conveyor 
system for detecting the positions of works and delivering 

the necessary amount of works while many works remain standby 
by automatic control; 

said parallel conveyor comprising: 

a one way conveyor (1) composed of a long conveyor (1a) 
to which many works are supplied so as to be standby and 

a short conveyor (1b, 1c) which follows the long 
conveyor; 
a pair of closing stoppers (7, 7) disposed between the 
long and short conveyors (1a, 1b, 1c) which close so as 

to permit the works to be standby on the long conveyor 
(1a) and open for transferring the works from the long 

conveyor (1a) to the short conveyor (1b, 1c) at need 
when the long conveyor (1a) stops; 
an opposite way conveyor (3) which is close to and 
parallel with the one way conveyor (1); and 
a pushing machine (10) disposed at the side of the short 
conveyor (1b, 1c) opposite to the opposite way conveyor 

(3) for transferring the works, which are transferred 
from the long conveyor (1a) to the short conveyor (1b, 

1c), to the opposite way conveyor (3) when the short 
conveyor (1b, 1c) stops and the closing stoppers (7, 7)
