<ABSTRACT>
A hooK (42) is formed on the rear surface of 
nozzle cover (38). A cantilever (44) is formed on the front 

surface of a nozzle (30) and extends forward. An engaging 
portion engageable with the hook (42), such as another hook 

(46) is formed on the upper surface of the cantilever (44). 
The hook (42) of the nozzle cover (38) is disengaged with 

the hook (46) of the cantilever (44) by pushing the 
cantilever (44) and bending the cantilever (44) downward.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a manually
operated trigger type dispenser attached to the mouth of a
container, sucking liquid from the container into a cylinder
and pressurizing and causing the liquid to flow out by
reciprocation of a piston in cooperating with traction of a
trigger, and also relates to a child proof mechanism.The problem of destroying the ozone layer is now a
great problem, Hence, dispensers which use no freon gas to
pressurize liquid and which are rather manually operated to
pressurize and force out liquid, are drawing more and more
attention. In the dispenser of this kind, a dispenser body
is connected to the mouth of a container holding liquid to
be dispensed by means of a connecting member such as a
bottle cap. and a cylinder is integrally formed on the
dispenser body, for example.A trigger is pivotablly attached to the dispenser
body, and a piston is reciprocated in the cylinder in
cooperation with traction of the trigger against urging
force of a return spring. When the piston is returned from
the pushed-in position to the initial position, the interior
of the cylinder is negatively pressurized. Then, a primary
valve is opened and a secondary valve is closed. When the
trigger is released, it is returned to the initial position
by the urging force of the return spring, and the piston is
also returned to the initial position in cooperation with
the trigger. Under the negative pressure in the cylinder,
the liquid is sucked from the container into the cylinder
through the primary valve as the liquid excludes residual
air in the cylinder. Upon pulling the trigger against the
return spring, the piston is pushed into the cylinder to
pressurize the liquid in the cylinder. The pressurized
liquid opens the secondary valve and flows from the cylinder
into a flowing-out passage formed in the dispenser body
through the second valve. A cylindrical blind-ended nozzle 
formed separately from the dispenser body is provided at the
front end of the passage. A spinner (swirling member) is
housed in the nozzle. The pressurized liquid presses the
spinner against the rear bottom surface of the nozzle, is
swirled by the spinner and flows out of an orifice (or a
flow-out port) of the front surface of the nozzle as a spray
flow. When the use of the dispenser is interrupted, the
liquid is sucked up into the cylinder and is retained in it.
When the trigger is pulled again, the pressurized liquid
flows out immediately.Normally, all the components of a dispenser such
as a dispenser body, a trigger, a

A child proof mechanism for a manually operated
trigger type dispenser (10) connectable to a mouth of a

container (20) and sucking liquid from the container (20)
into a cylinder, pressurizing liquid and causing the

pressurized liquid to flow out by reciprocation of a piston
(16) in cooperation with traction or swing of a trigger

(12), a nozzle cover (38) and a nozzle (30) being

integrally molded from a plastics material, the nozzle
cover (38) being connected to the nozzle (30) by a hinge (36)

and covering an orifice (34) of a front surface of the
nozzle (30) in liquid tightness in its closed position

so as to prevent flowing
out of the pressurized liquid, and comprising a cantilever

(44) formed on the nozzle (30), a hook (42) formed on the
nozzle cover (38) and an engaging portion (46,48,50) formed

on the cantilever (44) and engaged with the hook (42) when
the orifice (34) of the nozzle (30) is covered with the

nozzle cover (38) in liquid tightness, characterized in
that:


the cantilever (44) is formed on the front surface
of the nozzle (30), and has a flexible portion which

extends forward and horizontally from the front surface
of the nozzle (30);
the hook (42) is formed on a rear surface of the
nozzle cover (38); and
the engaging portion (46,48,50) is formed on the 
forward and horizontally extending cantilever portion, the

forward and horizontally extending cantilever portion is
provided with a bent portion (44a) on a front end, the bent

portion (44a) extends downwardly beyond a lower end of the
nozzle cover (38) and the engaging portion (46,48,50) is

disengaged from the hook (42) when the forward and
horizontally extending cantilever portion is bent downward

responsible to pushing force applied to the bent portion
(44a).
A child proof mechanism according to claim 1, wherein
the hook (42) includes a portion having two walls crossing

at right angles to each other.
A child proof mechanism according to claim 1 or 2,
wherein the engaging portion (46) of the cantilever (44) is

a hook (46) formed on an upper surface of the forward and
horizontally extending cantilever portion.
A child proof mechanism according to claim 1 or 2,
wherein the engaging portion (48) of the cantilever (44) is

an engaging hole (48) formed on the forward and
horizontally extending cantilever portion.
