<ABSTRACT>
This ultra-bulky fiber aggregate is obtained by blending (A) a polyester fiber and (B) a core-sheath type composite fiber 
wherein a low melting point component lower in melting point than the core is used for the sheath. The interlacing portions of 

three-dimensionally continuous fibers are fused by melting of the sheath portions of the core-sheath type composite fiber. The fiber 
aggregate has a thickness of at least 200 mm and a density of 0.02 to 0.1 g/cm³, and varies in density within ± 5 % in all of 

the longitudinal and transverse directions and the direction of height. The fiber aggregate can be used as a shoulder pat and 
a cushion material when it is cut. The production method of this fiber aggregate comprises blending (A) a polyester fiber 

and (B) a core-sheath type composite fiber using a low melting point component lower in melting point than the core for the 
sheath to obtain a card web, temporarily fusing card webs by far infrared rays or a hot air heater to laminate webs as required 

by a predetermined density and a predetermined thickness, and heat-treating the resulting laminate so as to mutually 
fuse the layers forming the laminate, wherein the heat-treatment is carried out by placing the laminate into a steam oven 

while it is compressed and clamped between two upper and lower plates and introducing the steam, the laminate being subjected 
to the heat-treatment while kept erect.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method for preparing an ultra-bulky fibre
aggregate consisting of polyester fibre aggregate which contains a binder fibre
having a low melting point.Various cushion materials made of polyester fibre have been developed.
However no product showing no strain by compression load and having
voluminous feel has been prepared.We have investigated and developed a method for the preparation of a cushion
material, which can be used as a bed mat and the like and has a voluminous
feel and a high quality, by using a conjugate fibre consisting of polyester
(Japanese Laid-Open Patent Publication No. 154050 of 1990).The method consists of a procedure in which polyester fibres (A) are mixed
with core-sheath type composite or conjugate fibres (B) in which a sheath
component of a lower melting point than that of the core component is used
in a specified ratio and the resultant card web is temporarily melt-adhered with
far-infrared radiation or with a hot air circulating heater and the temporarily
adhered webs are laminated according to the desired density and thickness and
then the laminated webs are heated to melt-adhere together the webs. By this
method a cushion material of approximately 10 cm thick can be prepared. However, when the webs are horizontally laminated and continuously heated
in dry air, an increased thickness restricts the uniformity of the density and
heat transmission. Also, in the case of a batch steaming system, an excessive
thickness gives a vertical density gradient by the weight of the fibres
themselves and results in an uneven product. Therefore, even the method
described in Japanese Laid-Open Patent Publication No. 154050 of 1990 could
not prepare stably a cushion material of as high a thickness as 20 cm or 50
cam in a uniform density.Thus, an object of the present invention is to eliminate the disadvantages of the
conventional technologies as mentioned above and to provide a product by
using polyester fibres, which is an ultra-bulky block fibre aggregate having a
high thickness of at least 20 cm, preferably 100 cm, and a uniform density in
all of three directions like a urethane foam and can be used as a cushion
material and a shoulder pad when sliced, and also to provide a method for the
stable preparation thereof.EP-A-0 371 807 discloses a block fibre aggregate prepared by mixing polyester
fibres and core-sheath type composite fibres. JP-A-2-154050 discloses a
similar block fibre aggregate wherein the density is of 0.02 to 0.1 g/cm3 and
the scattering of the
