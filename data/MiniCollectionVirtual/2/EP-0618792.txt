<ABSTRACT>
A topical application composition for mitigating male pattern baldness and testosterone-induced acne contains, as essential active, androgen-reducing components (a) a testosterone-reducing amount of an ionizable sodium salt, and (b) an association of compounds for forming, androgen segregating cellular proliferation phospholipids. The association includes lecithin, soy oil, phosphoric acid, choline chloride and optionally inositol and a nonionic surfactant in an amount for solubilizing and/or dispersing components (a) and (b) in a cosmetically-compatible vehicle for topical application.

<DESCRIPTION>
This application relates to compositions for mitigating acne
and male-pattern baldness and skin treatments therewith and
more particularly to such compositions containing both ionic
and enyzmatic components for neutralizing the excess of
androgens causing these conditions.It is well established that both acne and male-pattern
baldness are the result of accumulation of androgens,
particularly testosterone and dihydrotestosterone.Acne begins at puberty when the increase in circulating
androgens causes an increase in size and activity of the
pilosebaceous glands.Male-pattern baldness is common and it is well-recognized to
be familial and proven to require the presence of androgens.
(Merck Manual 15th Ed.pg. 2277 and 2281). It is recognized 
that circulating testosterone is metabolized in the skin to
dihydrotestosterone (DHT) (Benson et al U.S.Patent 4,088,760)
which is 4 to 20 times as potent an androgen as testosterone.It is postulated that the varying rates of formation and high
accumulations of DHT in the skin give rise to the
pathogenesis of acne and other androgen-related conditions,
particularly male-pattern baldness.Male-pattern baldness, wherein hair follicles, primarily on
the crown of the head, shrink in size, producing an ever
thinner and thinner hair until ultimately many follicles
shrink to a point where they no longer can produce a hair,
i.e., they become dormant. Individuals showing male -pattern
baldness begin to lose their hair early in life, often in
their twenties. It is well documented that male-pattern
baldness is a type of sex-influenced inheritance, with the
allele for pattern baldness being dominant in males and
recessive in females. The precise mechanism of androgen
conversion and toxic accumulation is not thoroughly
understood.Over the past several years, extracellular androgen-binding
macro molecules have been identified that are distinct from
the intracellular androgen-receptors. The best characterized
are the testosterone-extradiol binding globulin (TeBG) from
serum and the androgen binding protein (ABP) from the testes, 
as disclosed in "Extracellular Androgen Binding Proteins" by
Bardin et al in Ann.Rev. Physiol, 1981, pages 189 - 198. A
variety of in vivo studies have suggested that TeGB-bound
testosterone is less available for expression of biological
activity than is the free steroid.Although the absence of localized accumulation of androgens
is believed fundamentally necessary to counter acne and
expression of baldness in males, other factors are also
important.Basically,
