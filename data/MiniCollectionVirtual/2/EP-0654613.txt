<ABSTRACT>
A rolling element bearing comprises at least two bearing rings 
(1,2; 14, 15; 21, 22, 23) enclosing a bearing space (40), which bearing 

space (40) contains rolling elements (3, 13, 41), a cage (50, 16, 36) 
and lubrication means having a porous matrix (8, 11; 17, 18; 36) 

containing oil and accommodated between bearing rings, cage and/or 
rolling elements. In order to ob
tain a better lubrication for an 
improved useful service life, the porous matrix (8, 11; 17, 18; 36) is 

connected to a rotatable bearing element such as a cage (50, 16, 36), a 
seal (4, 5) or a ring (22, 23, 24) in such a way that it does not 

physically contact an other bearing element and that no frictional 
forces are generated with respect to such other bearing element, whereby 

upon rotation of the bearing element carrying the matrix the oil is 
driven through said matrix under the influence of centrifugal forces and 

any contaminants contained in the oil are filtered out.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a rolling element bearing comprising at
least two bearing rings and seals between said bearing rings enclosing a bearing space, which bearing space
contains rolling elements, a cage and rotatable lubrication means having a porous
matrix containing oil and being accommodated inside the bearing space defined by the bearing rings
and the seals.Such a bearing is disclosed in "Lubrication Engineering", pages
797-798, October 1991. The matrix consists of an oil filled polymer, which is
injection moulded or hand packed into the open bearing space and
subsequently hardened. By means of the oil contained in the polymer
matrix, a better lubrication of the rotating elements is aimed at than
was previously possible with grease lubricated bearings.Furthermore, grease lubricated bearings are known. The functional
properties of grease however appears to impose severe limitations on
bearing performance. For instance, the life of grease lubricated
bearings is reduced as the grease service life is usually much shorter
than the fatigue life of the bearings.Moreover, relubrication by adding fresh grease gives rise to
additional problems, in that it requires a special design of the bearing
housing, in that aged grease is difficult to remove, and in that after
replenishment of the grease stock too much grease may be left in the
bearing which leads to increased friction and temperature.Also, mechanical instability or churning of the grease due to
external factors such as vibrations and shocks, and internal factors
such as free bearing space available and geometry have a strong effect
on internal bearing friction and temperature.In grease lubrication, satisfactory working conditions can only
be obtained if the grease clears itself from the rolling elements and
finds a stable location in the bearing free space. During the transition
period following the lubrication, the grease is not in a stable position
and is circulating among the rolling elements. This effect causes a
large increase in temperature and friction, typically with a factor 2.The above bearing according to the state of the art tries to
solve these problems by using oil instead of grease as lubricant. In
order to keep the oil in place, it is accommodated in the porous matrix.
Nevertheles, such embodiment gives rise to problems as well. If, in
spite of the better lubrication, the temperature rises above a certain 
level, the polymer matrix which is in close contact with the raceways or
the rolling elements and which frictionally engages

Rolling element bearing comprising at least two bearing rings
(1, 2; 14, 15; 21, 22, 23) and seals (4, 5) between said bearing

rings, enclosing a bearing space (40) which contains rolling elements

it physically contacts none of the other bearing elements and that no

frictional forces are generated with respect to such other bearing
element, whereby upon rotation of the bearing element carrying the

matrix the oil is recirculated through said matrix by driving out in
radially outside direction under the influence of centrifugal forces,
