<ABSTRACT>
A system and program for concurrently accepting a plurality of page requests or messages, 
in "stand-alone" and over a network using a plurality of protocols, and providing those 

requests to one or a plurality of modems which can concurrently transmit page requests 
to several paging service carriers. The program may run on a multi-tasking operating system, 

such as the IBM OS/2, that supports multiple communications protocols and is 
preferably written in the C or C + + language and uses a combination of the IBM REXX 

program, incorporated in the OS/2 operating system, and C (IBM C2) and extensions to 
C. The system comprises an input component capable of concurrently accepting a plurality 

of page requests or messages; a queueing component or program for placing the plurality 
of page requests accepted by the input component in a queue; a program for concurrently 

selecting page requests from the queue for forwarding; and one or more modems for receiving 
page requests selected from the queue and forwarding the requests to one or more 

paging service carriers. The modems may forward different page requests or messages, 
from among the plurality of page messages received, to different paging services and the 

page messages accepted may involve different protocols and contain address information 
which is used in addressing the messages for forwarding to the paging service carriers. 

More than one page request may be sent during a telephone call and means may be provided 
for automatically resending a page message in response to an error message from a 

paging service. The selecting process may use automatic prioritizing of the selecting of 
page messages from the queue and recording of the page messages selected.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to the field of electronic paging and, more particularly, to a 
system and method for processing a flow of page requests from various sources and of 
various protocols to expedite their forwarding to paging service carriers for broadcast to 
their respective page destinations. The basic elements of an electronic paging system are a method and means for 1) receiving 
page requests in the form of electronic signals, e.g. from sources on a network, 2) processing 
the page request signals, 3) forwarding the processed page requests to a paging 
service carrier, usually via a modem, and 4) the transmitting or broadcasting of the requests 
by the paging service carrier to the subjects to be paged. The page requests may be 
generated in various ways but such systems usually have some form of computer component 
for receiving and processing the request signals. Many such paging systems are DOS 
based and run "stand alone", i.e., they do not receive page requests via a network, but 
rather, directly from a workstation on which the processing system is running. Typically 
these paging systems support only one modem communicating with one paging service at 
a time. Consequently, a paging user with a heavy volume of paging traffic, i.e., page messages 
to be forwarded to one or more paging services, must expend time consuming effort 
and experience delays and possible loss and confusion in attempting to handle the orderly 
transmission of its page requests.  It is therefore an object of the invention to provice a system and method for expediting the 
flow of paging requests or messages from their sources to the addressed paging service 
carrier. It is another object of the invention to provide a system and method for queueing page 
requests, received from various sources and having different protocols, to facilitate their 
processing. It is a further object of the invention to provide a system and method that are capable of 
efficiently handling large volumes of page request traffic in an expeditions manner for 
transmission to one or more paging service carriers. The present invention involves a system and method for concurrently accepting a plurality 
of page requests or messages, in "stand alone" and/or over a network using a plurality of 
protocols, and providing those requests to a modem or a plurality of modems that can 
concurrently transmit page requests by telephone or otherwise to several paging service 
carriers. A particular embodiment of the system may be designed to run on

<CLAIMS>
A system for processing page requests to be send to a paging service, comprising: 
modem means for receiving page requests and forwarding said requests to a paging service; 

and 
means for receiving page requests and providing said requests to said modem means for 

forwarding to said paging service, the improvement wherein said receiving means comprises: 
input means for concurrently accepting a plurality of page requests; 

means for placing said plurality of page requests accepted by said input means in a queue; 
and 

means for concurrently selecting page requests from said queue and providing said page 
requests to said modem mean
s for forwarding to said paging service. 
A system as in claim 1 wherein said modem means comprises a plurality of modems and 
said selecting means comprises means for concurrently providing said page requests respectively 

to said plurality of modems for forwarding. 
A system as in claim 2 wherein said plurality of modems forward different page requests 
from among said plurality of page requests to different paging services. 
A system as in claim 1 wherein said plurality of page requests comprise page requests 
of different protocols. 
A system as in claim 1 wherein said page requests comprise address information and said 
receiving means further comprises means for addressing said page requests in response to 

said address information. 
A system as in claim 1 wherein said modem means comprises a plurality of modems, 
each of said modems being connected to a respective telephone line for making a telephone 

call to a paging service for forwarding a page request thereto, and wherein said receiving 
means further comprises means for sending more than one page request during a telephone 

call. 
A system as in claim 1 wherein said receiving means further comprises means for automatically 
resending a page request in response to an error message from said paging service. 
A system as in claim 1 wherein said selecting means further comprises means for automatically 
prioritizing the selecting of page messages from said queue. 
A system as in claim 1 wherein said receiving means further comprises means for recording 
the page requests provided to said modem means. 
A method for processing page requests to be sent to a paging service, comprising the 
steps of: 

concurrently accepting a plurality of page requests;
 

placing said plurality of page requests accepted in a queue; and 
concurrently selecting page requests from said queue and providing said concurrently selected 

page requests for forwarding to a paging service. 
A method as in claim 10 wherein said plurality of page requests comprise page requests 
of different protocols.
