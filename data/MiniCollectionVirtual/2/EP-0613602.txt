<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a method and apparatus 
for decoding Manchester encoded digital data signals and is 
particularly concerned with providing autocalibration. It is well known to use Manchester encoding of 
binary data for example for transmission of data. In 
Manchester encoding, a data '1' is represented by the two-bit 
word 10, and a data '0' is represented by the opposite 
two bit word 01. The transmitted bit rated is thus twice 
the data rate. Advantages of Manchester encoding include a 
high signal transmission density (changes between '0' and 
'1' bits), a null d.c. component in the transmitted signal 
spectrum, and the ability to detect data errors as sequence 
violations (e.g., the two-bit words 00 and 11 represent 
errors rather than valid data). In decoding Manchester data, it is necessary for 
the decoder to be synchronized to the two-bit word 
boundaries (also known as the active edges). For example, 
a series of data '1's is encoded as a bit sequence 
..,10.10101010...; if the decoder is out of phase with the 
word boundaries, this will be incorrectly interpreted as a 
series of data '0's, i.e., the bit sequence ...01010101... A number of techniques are known for decoding a 
Manchester coded digital data signal - see for example EP-A-0 150 072. One technique uses a 
digital phase lock loop (PLL) which locks to the active 
edge of the receive signal. Another technique uses a 
differentiator followed by a tuned resonant filter to 
recover the bit rate clock. The receive bit stream is 
clocked by the bit rate clock and the receive data is 
decoded using any of a number of known methods. With the increasing popularity of programmable 
logic arrays for the implementation of fully digital 
circuits and digital circuits generally, it is desirable to 
provide a fully digital Manchester data receiver. It is 
also desirable to provide a receiver with autocalibration 
to transmitter clock frequency and to compensate for 
variations in clock phase and frequency caused by operating  
 
conditions. For example, silicon CMOS integrated circuits 
introduce wide time differences or deltas between their 
best case propagation delays and their worst case 
propagation delays. The deltas are primarily due to 
operating temperature variation, supply voltage variation 
and chip processing variation. An object of the present invention is to provide 
an improved circuit for receiving Manchester coded digital 
data signals. In accordance with an aspect of the present 
invention there is provided a method of
