<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a radio telephone device consisting 
of a base unit connected to wire circuits such as 
subscribers' lines and a radio telephone connected to the 
base unit via a radio circuit, and more particularly to a 
radio telephone device which is capable of dialing under on-hook 
state from the radio telephone. The following is an example of a radio telephone device 
consisting of a base unit connected to wire circuits and a 
radio telephone connected to the base unit via a radio circuit. 
FIG. 7 illustrates the configuration thereof, which 
consists of a base unit 2 connected to a subscriber's line 1 
and a radio telephone 4 connected to the base unit 2 via a 
radio circuit 3. The base unit 2 includes a transmitter ( TX ) 22 for 
which a transmitting and receiving channel is allocated by a 
synthesizer ( SYN ) 21 and a receiver ( RX ) 23, modulates 
talking signals arrived from the terminal of a correspondent 
for conversation via the subscriber's line 1 during conversation 
by said transmitter 22 after passing through a line 
relay 24 and a hybrid circuit 25 to send out to the radio 
circuit 3 from a transmitting antenna 26. At the same time,  
 
the base unit 2 demodulates radio talking signals arrived 
from the radio telephone 4 via the radio circuit 3 by the 
receiver 23 via a receiving antenna 27, and then sends out 
to the subscriber's line 1 via said hybrid circuit 25 and 
line relay 24. The base unit 2 also includes, as circuits 
necessary for the connection between the subscriber's line 1 
and the radio telephone 4, a signal reception-detection circuit 
28 for detecting 16 Hz calling signals arriving from a 
switchboard, a received electric field-detection circuit 
(C-DET) 29, an identifying signal-detection circuit (ID-DET) 
30 and a control circuit ( CONT ) 31. The received electric 
field-detection circuit 29 consists of a carrier squelch 
circuit or a noise squelch circuit, which monitors the arrival 
of radio waves from the radio telephone 4. The identifying 
signal-detection circuit 30 collates an identifying 
signal ( ID code ) which has been predetermined by a combination 
of the base unit 2 and the radio telephone 4, and 
notifies the result of the collation to the control circuit 
31. The control circuit 31 includes, for example, a 
microcomputer as a main control unit, and performs various 
connection controls. A rectified stabilizing circuit 32 supplies 
a predetermined operating voltage Vcc from the commercial 
power supply output to each circuit in the base unit
