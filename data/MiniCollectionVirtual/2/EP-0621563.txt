<ABSTRACT>
A system reads a data record from a card and, based on 
this information, prints on a section of a travelling web of 

paper. The printed web section is tracked and the card providing 
the data record is affixed to the web section. The printed web 

section with card is then separated to form a letter sheet and 
inserts are selected for the letter sheet with card based on the 

previously read data record for the card. The letter sheet with 
card and selected inserts is then stuffed into an envelope and 

an indication of the weight of the envelope with enclosures, 
based on the known weight of the envelope, card and letter sheet 

and the known weights of the selected inserts, is provided to a 
franking machine.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a system and a method for
preparing letters for mailing.A number of machines exist for automating portions of
the task of preparing letters for mass mailings and target
mailings. It is recognized that the response to a mass mailing
is on the order of two percent. Conversely, the response for
target mailings is on the order of twenty-four percent.
Accordingly, it would be desirable to provide a high speed system
for preparing letters for the mails which would be particularly
adapted for target mailings.U.S. Patent No. 5,012,073 issued April 30, 1991 to
Hewitt discloses a system for attaching data cards to pre-printed
mailer forms. As a web of forms is advanced, data from a form
is read and compared with data on a card. Provided the data
matches, the matching card is advanced into registration with the
form and inserted into diagonally opposed cuts in the form. The
form is then burst from the web and folded; the folded forms are
then stacked at an output hopper. A timing disc indicates the
position of the web and photocells indicate the position of
folded forms. According to the present invention, there is provided
a system for preparing letters for mailing comprising the
following: a source of data records; means for conveying a web
of paper in a downstream direction along a first path, said web
comprising a plurality of sections; means for sensing the
position of sections of said web along said first path; a high
speed printer in said first path for printing upon consecutive
ones of said plurality of sections of said web; control means
responsive to said data records source and said web section 
sensing means for, repetitively, reading a data record from said
data records source and, responsive to said read data record and
said web section sensing means, controlling said printer to print
on a web section; a separator at the downstream end of said first
path for separating a letter sheet from each section of said web
of paper; a letter sheet conveyor for conveying letter sheets
separated by said separator in a downstream direction along a
second path; means for determining the position of letter sheets
conveyed along said second path; a plurality of insert feeders
adjacent said second path, each for feeding inserts to letter
sheets travelling along said second path; means responsive to
said web section sensing means, said letter sheet position
determining means and said data records source for, repetitively,
tracking a web section printed in accordance with a given data
record
