<ABSTRACT>
In a method for arranging spacers meant to be supplied to a table and/or to objects during stacking, spacers are supplied to a path (5) from a magazine (3). A device (1) for handling the spacers when carrying out the method comprises the said path (5), which is shaped of separate bodies, locking means arranged on each body for holding one adjacent spacer on the path and means (17) for transferring spacers from the path (5) to the table (8) and/or to objects on the table. The spacers are supplied to the path (5) in such a way that they lie against one another in a row and in such a way that each spacer extends on two bodies and by said locking means is fixed to the one body. After that the bodies are brought to move from one another lengthwise of the path forming a gap between the bodies, whereby the spacers are separated with one another and/or positioned. The fixing of the locking means is released and said transfer means (17) transfer those spacers which are going to be transferred to the table (8) and/or to the objects on the table. Then the bodies are brought together again and the path (5) is filled out with new spacers from the magazine (3) to replace that number of spacers which have been transferred to the table (8) and/or to the objects on the table.

<DESCRIPTION>
 METHOD AND DEVICE FOR ARRANGING SPACERS DURING STACKING OF EXTENDED ARTICLESThe present invention relates to a method for arranging spacers which are meant for being supplied to a table for receiving articles for stacking and/or articles during stacking. The spacers are of such a kind that usually form at least a basis for articles and intermediate elements between articles, which are to be stacked, packed or the like for further handling, stock-keeping, transportation, etc.In for example industrial production there is a need of a more rational handling of spacers. Further, there is a need of a more rapid process in handling of articles, which have been produced or manufactured and which require after-handling. Besides, there is a need of reducing the risk of i.a. exterior damages, as scratches or the like, to produced articles, especially such articles which are going to show excelent surface or fine surface and particularly concerning such articles, which are easily damaged by external mechanical effects, will be handled after the manufacture in such a way, that they are exposed to mechanical influence or have disposit¬ ion to scratches or the like. One example of such articles is aluminium profiles. Other examples can be tubes, sheet-metals, especially surface treated sheet-metals, other articles of some length and which, for example, in use must have that surface which has been produced when manufactured, etc.It is well known that in sawmill and also in other wood-working industries spacers or so-called stickers are generally existing. Further, spacers are used in manufacture industries and metal-working industries for elongated articles. However, the handling of the spacers is done manually or to a great extent manually. Further, the spacers are often shaped in such a way that they by themselves can give rise to external damages on those articles with which they are used and/or are of such a kind or material that they are consumer or non-returnable goods.A method and a device in accordance with the present invention can fulfil the requirements made, while at the same time the disadvantages of known methods and devices are eliminated. One object with the present invention is thus to achieve a more rational handling of spacers and in addition 

results in a simpler and more rapid process and running through in the handling of articles, which have been produced or manufactured and will be taken care of for further handling, which in turn involves lower cost. Another object is to eliminate or at least

Claims :
1. A method to arrange spacers meant for being supplied to a table and/or to articles during stacking, characterized in that spacers (2) from a source (3) of spacers are supplied to a path (5) shaped of bodies (6) and are separated, after that two or more spacers (2) are moved from the path (5) to a table (8) or similar and/or to articles situated on the table and during stacking on the table.
2. A method in accordance with claim 1, characterized in that spacers (2) are supplied to the path (5) to lie against one another in a row one after the other and until the path (5) is filled out with spacers (2) .
3. A method in accordance with claim 1 or 2, characterized in that each spacer (2) supplied to the path (5) is held to a body (6) and that the bodies (6) after that are brought to move away from one another length¬ wise the path (5) for positioning of the spacers (2).
4. A method in accordance with claim 3, characterized in that means (17) for transfer the spacers (2) from the path (5) to the table (8) and/or to the articles at this are given possibility to grasp the spacers (2) and that the spacers (2) are transferred to the table (8) and/or to the articles by means of said means (17) after that the holding of the spacers (2) is released.
5. A device for handling of spacers for articles for carrying out the method in accordance with any of the claims 1 - 4, whereby spacers (2) from a source (3) of spacers will be supplied to a table (8) or similar and/or to articles during stacking, characterized in that the device (1) comprises a path (5) which is shaped of separate bodies (6) which are arranged to be able to be displaced from one another to form a gap (9) between the bodies (6) during holding of the spacers (2) , whereby each spacer is held by a body (6) , and means (17) which are shaped to be able to grip, engage or similar the spacers (2) for transfer the spacers (2) from the path (5) to the table (8) and/or to articles on the table.
6. A device in accordance with claim 5, characterized in that each spacer (2) is arranged to extend in the path (5) in or on two bodies (6) . 


7. A device in accordance with claim 5 or 6, characterized in that the source (3) of spacers comprises a magazine for spacers (2) and a lift¬ ing element (43) or a similar basis, which is arranged to be able to lift the spacers (2) in the magazine.
8. A device in accordance with claim 5, 6 or 7, characterized in that the source (3) of spacers comprises a magazine for spacers (2) and holding elements which are arranged to be able to hold spacers (2) in the magazine, while spacers (2) or a layer of spacers in the magazine are arranged to rest on a lifting element (43) or a similar basis and which spacers or layer of spacers are situated in a lower level than the rest of the spacers in the magazine or form a lowest layer of spacers in the magazine, whereby the spacers (2) resting on the lifting element (43) or similar are arranged to be brought towards a feed belt (16) or similar for introduction or transference of spacers (2) to the path (5).
9. A device in accordance with any of the claims 5 - 8, characterized in that a motor (37), for example a worm gear motor, is arranged in order to operate a feed path (4) in the magazine for feeding spacers (2) to a introducing device or feeder ( 16) , for example in form of a feed belt
(16) , for introduction or transference of spacers (2) to the path (5) and that the device (1) comprises means indicating when the path (5) is filled with spacers (2) and are. arranged to stop the motor (37), when the path (5) is filled out with spacers (2) , whereby the introducing device or feeder (16) stop, as well as the feed path (4).
