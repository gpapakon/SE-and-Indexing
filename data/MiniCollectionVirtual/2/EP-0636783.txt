<ABSTRACT>
A device for fixing a liquid filter (11) on a vehicle tank (12) is proposed, which is of simple, low-cost construction. For this purpose the liquid filter (11) is encompassed by an annular clamp fitting (14) of a bracket (13), which with a projecting mounting spigot (17) and a support arm (18) are inserted into matching receivers (24, 25) on the vehicle tank (12) and interchangeably support the filter (11) in a formed recess (21) of the vehicle tank (12).

Device for fastening a liquid filter to an engine
part, in particular a vehicle tank, with the aid of a

holding means (13, 31) which has the function of a
tension clip (14) which annularly surrounds the

cylindrical housing of the filter (11), on which holding
means outwardly projecting fastening means (17, 18) are

arranged, characterized in that the fastening means are
designed as an insertion foot (17), formed-on on the

holding means (13, 31) and designed to be inserted into
an insertion shoe (24) arranged fixedly on the engine

part (12), and as a holder arm (18) projecting obliquely
outwards from the housing of the filter (11), the

insertion foot (17) and holder arm (18) being arranged in
the holding means (13, 31) at the greatest possible

distance from one another, so that the insertion foot
(17) and the holder arm (18) are arranged essentially

diametrically on the structural element (13, 31) performing
the function of the tension clip (14).
Device according to Claim 1, characterized in
that the insertion foot (17) and holder arm (18) and, in

particular, the annular tension clip (14) extend essentially
in one plane.
Device according to Claim 1 or 2, characterized
in that the holding means (13, 31) consists of plastic.
Device according to one of Claims 1 to 3, characterized
in that the holder arm (18) runs essentially

tangentially to the cylindrical housing of the filter
(11).
Device according to one of Claims 1 to 4, characterized 
in that the insertion foot (17), on the one hand,

and the holder arm (18) arranged diametrically thereto,
on the other hand, extend in opposite directions.
Device according to one of Claims 1 to 5, characterized
in that the length of the freely projecting

holder arm (18) is a multiple of the length of the
insertion foot (17).
Device according to one of Claims 1 to 6, characterized
in that the holding means (13, 31) is fastened

unreleasably to the vehicle tank (12), and the tension
clip (14) is split and its two ends (15) can be braced by

means of a clamping screw (16).
Device according to Claim 7, characterized in
that the holder arm (18) is welded to the vehicle tank

(12) consisting of plastic.
Device according to one or more of Claims 1 to 6,
characterized in that the function of the tension clip

(14) is performed by the housing of the filter (11), and
the holder arm (18) is fastened releasably to the vehicle

tank (12) by means of a snap connection (32).
Device according to Claim 9, characterized in
that the holding means (31) is injection-moulded on the

liquid filter (12), the housing of which consists of
plastic.
Device according to one of Claims 1 to 10,
characterized in that the vehicle tank (12) has a shaped-in

portion (21) which receives the liquid filter (11)
together with the holding means (13, 31) and which is

delimited by two walls (22, 23) which are approximately
perpendicular to one another and the width of which

corresponds approximately to the diameter of the tension
clip (14), and in that the insertion shoe (24) is formed-on

on one of these walls (22), whilst a groove (25)
extends from the other wall (23) and runs in an adjoining

outer wall (26), the groove (25) receiving the strap-like
holder arm (18).
Device according to Claim 11, characterized in
that the snap connection (32) for the holder arm (18) is

arranged at the end of the groove (25) on the outer wall 
(26) or at the end of the holder arm (18).
