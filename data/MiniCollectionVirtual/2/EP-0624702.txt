<ABSTRACT>
The hinge comprises a circular flat (11) extended into a 
rectangular zone (12) serving as a means of joining to the 

door (10) at one of its upper or lower horizontal bases by 
means of the screws (13). The circular shape (25) covers the 

entire lower vertical base of the door (10), and also the 
hinges (11-12) and (21-22), and is fixed to the frame member 

(15) comprising the rail (16) and the stiles (17), by means of 
an angular support (20) and a flat (26).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present application for a Patent of Invention 
concerns a "PERFECTED HINGE", as indicated in its 
wording, whose new construction, conformation and design 
features fulfil the aim for which they have been 
specifically designed, with maximum safety and 
efficiency. There are a set of hinges available on the market 
which we could call accident-proof and which can 
therefore be considered state-of-the-art. These prevent 
their application to door frames, window frames and the 
like from causing any kind of undesired effect through 
fingers becoming trapped between the jamb from which the 
door hangs and the door itself. The same applicant, at a given time, requested Utility 
Models nº 8903041(9) and nº 9001889(5), which in the 
first of them claimed a hinge formed by an open circular 
longitudinal section, split at one length, thus allowing 
the door, window or similar, which had to open or close, 
to be placed inside it. This circular section was slotted 
inside another section, which was also slightly circular 
and long, which was secured to the frame. The second section was formed by two parts or half-sections, 
which were secured by the corresponding screws, 
thus making the first inside section easy to mount, as 
this second section was formed by two complementary 
pieces greater in diameter than the first. The second Utility Model nº 9001889(5) was a perfected 
version of the first, in the sense that it introduced a 
set of accessories to the hinge which is the object of 
Utility Model nº 8903041(9) in order to fix it to the 
frame, so that the task of attaching the door to the 
frame, removing it, or closing it was made easier, these 
accessories were supports which were mounted both on the 
upper part of the closing frame, as well as on the lower 
part of the hinge which was fixed onto it. The placing on the market of the objects of the  
 
Utility Models described above, have clearly revealed a 
series of advantages, above all those which already 
exist, but also a series of drawbacks which the present 
model aims to put right; on the one hand, the excessive 
price of the hinge as it was originally conceived, being 
two open circular longitudinal sections, which had to be 
specially made and could be not be purchased on the 
market ready-made, and on the other, a problem of chafing 
as a result of the hinge working with two circular cross-sections 
of different diameters, one inside the other, 
and therefore with a great deal of chafing surface 
between them, which, as a result of the weight

<CLAIMS>
1st - "PERFECTED HINGE", one of those made up of two 
circular pieces or sections, one inside the other, one of 

which is secured to the jamb of a door, window, or the 
like, and the second secured to the lintel of the same, 

characterised by the fact that the hinge described is 
formed by a circular section (25) which is placed in a 

vertical position and fitted to the jamb (17) of the 
frame (15), providing a means for securing the door (10) 

to the frame (15). 
2nd - "PERFECTED HINGE", characterised according to 
the above claim by the fact that the means for securing 

the door (10) to the frame (15), are formed by an upper 
hinge formed by a flat circular plate (11) which is 

extended into a rectangular part (12), having an elastic 
stub (14) in the central part of (10). 
3rd - "PERFECTED HINGE", characterised according to 
the 1st claim by the fact that the means for securing the 

door (10) to the frame (15), are formed by a lower hinge 
with a circular part (21), the surface of which is 

slightly conical (23) and which is extended into a 
rectangular area (22), having a drilled hole (28) in the 

central part of (23). 
4th - "PERFECTED HINGE", characterised according to 
the 1st claim by the fact that the means for securing the 

door (10) to the frame (15), are formed by a plate (26) 
which has a cavity (27) for fitting the elastic stub 

(14). 
5th - "PERFECTED HINGE", characterised according to 
the 1st claim by the fact that the means for securing the 

door (10) to the frame (15), are formed by an angular 
support (20) onto which a semiaxis (29) is mounted which 

fits into the drill (28) of the hinge (21-22).
