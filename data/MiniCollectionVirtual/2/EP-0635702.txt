<ABSTRACT>
A powder flow rate is measured based on a simple 
construction so as to provide method and apparatus for measuring 

the powder flow rate for example of a powder coating material, 
requiring less maintenance cost and facilitating change of color 

of the coating material. In the method for measuring powder 
flow rate: a density ρ 1 of the powder within a tank is 

measured; the powder is drawn out from the tank into a conveying 
tube; a detecting fluid is blown at a flow rate Qf into the 

conveying tube; a density ρ 2 of the powder in the conveying 
tube is measured; and a powder flow rate Fm is measured based on 

an equation of 

Fm = Qf · ρ 1 · ρ 2/(ρ 1 - ρ 2) 
 
. The density ρ 1 

of the powder in the tank may be measured by providing a pair of 
pressure measuring devices at different heights within the tank. 

The density ρ 2 of the powder in the conveying tube may be 
measured through a measurement of electrostatic capacity, light 

transmittance or ultrasonic wave transmittance in the conveying 

tube.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method and an
apparatus for measuring a powder flow rate, which may be
applied, for example, in supplying of a powder coating material.In automatic powder coating, it has been necessary to
supply a coating material at a constant rate to achieve a
uniform finish of paint coat and to efficiently use the coating
material. In order to constantly supply the coating material,
various methods for measuring its flow rate have been proposed
for use in controlling the powder flow rate. For example,
Japanese Patent Publication No.3-7045 and Japanese Patent Laid-Open
No.62-64911 respectively disclose methods in which a
detecting tube having a uniform diameter is provided in the
conveying portion. A predetermined amount of a detecting fluid
is blown into an inlet of the detecting tube, and pressures at
the inlet and at an outlet thereof are detected to determine the
powder flow rate based on difference between the two pressures.In the method of measuring the powder flow rate by
detecting such pressure difference, however, the powder tends to
flow backward into the pressure detecting part especially when,
for example, the conveying of the powder is to be stopped. In
order to prevent such backward flow of the powder to the
pressure detecting part, flushing, for example, is necessary of
a purge fluid or the like, requiring a large number of pipes,
hoses, etc. Accordingly, the mechanism of the apparatus becomes
complicated and the manufacturing cost of the apparatus is 
thereby increased. A much work time is also required for its
installation and maintenance.Further, while use of a screw feeder or the like is
actually practiced to supply the powder coating material at a
constant rate, the mechanism for such purpose intrinsically
becomes of a large scale. The manufacturing cost of the
apparatus is higher. In addition, the portion to be cleaned at
the time of changing the color of coating material is
complicated in structure, and this is very difficult to be coped
with.Other methods for measuring a powder flow rate are
known from the field of supplying particulate fuel to a
gasification reactor.For example, DE-A-27 57 032 discloses a method for
measuring a mass flow of solid fuel in form of fine grains
or dust in which the solid fuel is introduced into a flow
of a conveying fluid. Just before entering the gasification
reactor, the total density of the conveying fluid and solid
fuel is measured by a radiometric method. Based on this
data the mass flow of the fuel particles is calculated
