<ABSTRACT>
A method for producing a woven/non-woven thermoadhesive product 
particularly for interfacings for use in the clothing field, 

comprising dots melting at differential temperature and formed by 
melting heat-sensitive resins and then extruding them onto an 

indented roll of low adhesion material, transferring the material 
from the transfer belt to a woven/non-woven substrate, activating 

with electrical charges, and depositing resin microgranules having 
a melting point different from that of the base material.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a method for producing a woven/non-woven
thermoadhesive product particularly for interfacings comprising
dots melting at differential temperature, in which heat-molten
resins are extruded and deposited on the woven/non-woven fabric
support and then covered with resin granules of a different
melting point by means of a resin strewer. The fabric is then
cleaned of all the excess deposited granules to leave it clean and
ready for use. The present invention also relates to a plant for
producing a woven/non-woven thermoadhesive product, the plant
comprising a conveyor belt of low adhesive power. It is already
known in the state of the art to produce textile supports of
cotton, wool, polyamide or any other type of fabric or material,
and to cover them with dots, lines or any other type of pattern
formed from a thermoadhesive product of differential melting
point. Although the known production systems apply the
thermoadhesion concept and the double dot system they start by
depositing resins in paste and powder form (see FR-A-2 346 058).One of the main problems is that the fabric substrate undergoes 
thermal shock at the moment in which the adhesive material is
deposited on it. A further often occurring drawback is that said
thermoadhesive material can penetrate into the thickness of the
fabric substrate and cause it to harden. In addition the feel of
the fabric is strongly compromised.In a known method of the aforesaid type a transfer support is
covered with droplets of an at least partly thermoadhesive
substance, these droplets then being heated to ensure adhesion.The droplets are then brought into contact with the fabric without
heating it, to enable the thermoadhesive substance to be
transferred from the transfer support to said woven/non-woven
substrate but without penetrating into the substrate.Said system however uses a liquid solution. There is therefore
the risk that by forming a wet base incorporating the resin, a so-called
"snowflake" dot is formed, giving less constant adhesion.The object of the present invention is therefore to provide a
method for producing a product in woven/non-woven thermoadhesive
form for use in the clothing field, which in the light of the
drawbacks consequent on the use of methods of the known art offers
two main characteristics, namely that the thermoadhesive substance
which is deposited on the fabric substrate remains on the surface
of the product, ie does not penetrate into it and therefore does
not produce stiffening and traversing problems, and

<CLAIMS>
A method for producing a woven/non-woven thermoadhesive
product particularly for interfacings for use in the clothing

field, characterised by presenting dots melting at differential
temperature and comprising the following processing stages in

succession:

melting heat-sensitive resins of any type and then extruding
them onto an indented roll of low adhesion material;
transferring the extruded material from the indented roll onto
a preheated conveying transfer belt of medium adhesion material;
preheating the material on the transfer belt and passing it
from the transfer belt to a woven/non-woven substrate;
activating with positive electrical charges;
depositing resin microgranules having a melting point
different from that of the base material;
fixing the dots by passage through a micrometrically regulated
cooled calender;
deactivating the resin material with negative electrical
charges;
cleaning the woven/non-woven substrate by beating and blowing,
followed by sucking off the material not retained by the

substrate.
A method as claimed in claim 1, characterised in that the
shape of the indentations in the indented roll of low adhesion

material directly depends on the form of the melting dot to be
provided on the woven/non-woven substrate.
A method as claimed in claim 1, characterised in that the 
heat-sensitive resins are in the form of granules.
A method as claimed in claim 1, characterised in that the
extruded material is maintained at a temperature of between 70 and

transfer belt of medium adhesion material is maintained at a

temperature of between 150 and 180°C.
A method as claimed in claim 1, characterised in that
after the extru
ded material has passed from it to the woven/non-woven
substrate, the transfer belt is cooled to a temperature of

between 30 and 50°C to facilitate its cleaning.
A plant for implementing the method claimed in claims 1 to

guide and support means (6, 8) with a medium adhesion surface for

thermoadhesive material transfer, a second discharge roll provided
with associated second heating means (13), and cleaning means (14)

for the transfer support; said discharge roll being associated
with a deviation and receiving roller (18) positioned along the

woven/non-woven product processing line along which means (20) are
also provided for strewing low melting point resins over the

thermoadhesive material, means for applying alternate positive and
negative electrical charges to the thermoadhesive material, means
