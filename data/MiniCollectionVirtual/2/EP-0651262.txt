<ABSTRACT>
The present invention provides a handheld, 
battery-powered device, such as a torch, comprising a 

battery housing and a battery tester intimately 
associated with the housing, the tester having an 

externally visible display, wherein the tester is 
operable independently from the device, thereby avoiding 

problems with loss of the tester or continuous running.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates generally to portable 
battery-powered devices, such as battery-powered 
flashlights and lanterns, having a device for indicating 
the level of charge or capacity of the batteries 
contained therein. Flashlights and a majority of portable lanterns are 
battery-operated using either non-rechargeable or 
rechargeable batteries. One problem commonly associated 
with these batteries is determining the useful or 
remaining life of the battery. If the batteries are 
already in a flashlight or portable lantern, the 
quickest way to determine the strength of the battery is 
by turning the flashlight or lantern on. If the 
incandescent or fluorescent lamp illuminates, then most 
individuals are satisfied that the batteries are good. However, if the flashlight or portable lantern does 
not illuminate, then the question is whether the problem 
lies in the batteries or the lamp bulb. The user must 
then either replace the batteries in the flashlight with 
new batteries and/or replace the bulb, or remove the 
existing batteries and/or the bulb for testing. Several devices have been developed for testing 
batteries to determine the freshness or state of charge 
of the cell. For example, United States Patent No's 
4,723,656 and 5,128,616 disclose blister-type packaging 
for new batteries with a battery condition indicator 
built into the blister portion of the package. The 
blister can be deformed to place the tester across the 
terminals of the battery to be tested.  The tester employs a thermochromic material in 
combination with a resistive element. The flow of 
current produces a temperature gradient across the 
resistive element which, in turn, causes a colour change 
in the thermochromic material to indicate the state of 
charge of the battery. Because the testers are 
associated with the package in which the batteries are 
purchased, however, they suffer from the drawback that 
they tend to be discarded with the empty packaging. The 
state of charge of the batteries then becomes 
indeterminate once more. United States Patent No's 4,702,563, 4,702,564, 
4,726,661, and 4,737,020 disclose flexible battery 
testers which have a conductive circuit pattern 
associated with a layer of thermochromic material. The 
flexible member is bent so that the circuit pattern can 
contact the positive and negative terminals of the 
battery to be tested and, again, the temperature 
gradient is observed via the thermochromic material and 
correlated with the state-of-charge of the battery. Again, these

A handheld, battery-powered device, such as a torch, 
comprising a battery housing and a battery tester 

intimately associated with the housing, the tester 
having an externally visible display, characterised in 

that the tester is operable independently from the 
device. 
A portable lighting device comprising in combination: 
   a housing for retaining at least one battery; 

   a light source attached to the housing and operable 
by the battery; and 

   a laminated battery tester fixed to an exterior 
surface of the housing and having a first end operably 

connected to one pole of the battery and a second end 
operably connectable to an opposite pole of the battery, 

the battery tester providing an indication of the 
battery strength. 
A flashlight battery tester, comprising in 
combination: 

   a flashlight housing having first and second 
terminals, each in electrical continuity with one pole 

of at least one battery disposed within the housing; 
   a display circuit mounted on the flashlight housing 

and having a first end in electrical contact with the 
first terminal, and a second end disposed above and 

flexibly engageable with the second terminal, whereby 
depression of the second end into contact with the 

second terminal causes a current to pass through the 
display circuit thereby to provide an indication of the 

strength of the battery. 
A battery tester for use on the exterior of a 
flashlight, the flashlight having a housing for 

retaining at least one battery, and a light source 
 

operably connected through a first switch to the 
battery, the battery tester comprising in combination: 

   a conductor fixed to the exterior of the housing and 
having a first end operably coupled to one pole of the 

at least one battery and a second end operably 
connectable with an opposite pole of the at least one 

battery, the conductor having a region resistive to an 
electrical current flowing therethrough; and 

   a responsive display overlying the conductor for 
displaying the capacity of the battery in response to 

the resistance to the electrical current flowing through 
the conductor. 
A device according to any preceding claim which is a 
battery-powered torch. 
A device according to any preceding claim, wherein 
the tester is effectively permanently secured to the 

housing. 
A device according to any preceding claim, wherein 
the tester comprises a flexible strip which is 

conductive, or conductively treated, which is 
electrically secured to one pole of the battery and 

which is biassable toward electrical connection with the 
second pole. 
A device according to any preceding claim wherein a 
thermochromic dye is employed in the tester to indicate 

the level of charge of any battery in the device 
according to heat generated by a resistive element in 

the tester. 
A device according to any preceding claim, 
comprising a manual switch to complete or break the 

testing circuit, as required, particularly preferably 
where the switch is only in the on position for so long 

 
as manual pressure is applied. 
A device according to any preceding claim, 
comprising a Belleville switch to complete the tester 

circuit.
