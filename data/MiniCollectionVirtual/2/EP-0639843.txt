<ABSTRACT>
An arc extinguishing chamber (1) for switches (circuit breakers), especially for load break switches (load disconnector circuit breakers) in medium-voltage switching installations filled with extinguishing gas, having a stationary contact (3) in an open arc extinguishing chamber housing (2), a moving contact (4) and at least two arc extinguishing plates (5) which are arranged parallel to one another and essentially surround the path of the moving contact (4) at least over part of its length, has a simple and thus cost-effective construction and at the same time has an efficiency which is comparable to closed arc extinguishing chambers.

Switch with an arc extinguishing chamber, in particular 
a load-break switch for quenching gas filled medium voltage 

switchgear, comprising 

a fixed contact (3) 
a movable contact (4) 
a washer (7) carried by the movable contact (4) and 
at least two arc quenching plates (5) arranged parallel 
to one another and surrounding the movable contact (4) on 

at least part of its travel around substantially the 
whole of its circumference, characterised by having 
an open arc extinguishing chamber housing (1) and 
a suction washer (7) fixed on the shaft of the movable 
contact (4). 
Switch according to claim 1, characterised in that the 
fixed contact (3) is a striking contact and the movable contact 

(4) is a contact pin. 
Switch according to claim 1 or claim 2, characterised in 
that the extinguishing chamber housing (2) is open at one end 

and is provided with openings (11) in the side walls. 
Switch according to one of claims 1 to 3, characterised 
in that the fixed contact (3) is fixed to the closed end of the 

extinguishing chamber housing (2). 
Switch according to one of claims 1 to 4, characterised 
in that the arc quenching plates (5) are aligned with their 

main planes substantially perpendicular to the direction of 
movement of the movable contact.  

 
Switch according to claim 5, characterised in that the 
quenching plates (5) are located at the level of the side 

openings (11) of the extinguishing chamber. 
Switch according to one of claims 1 to 6, characterised 
by having insulating spacers (6) between the quenching plates 

(5). 
Switch according to one or more of claims 1 to 7, 
characterised by having a guide (12) for the contact pin 

located outside the extinguishing chamber housing (2). 
Switch according to claim 8, characterised in that the 
contact pin has a guide shaft (4) with at least two guide pins 

(14a, b) extending substantially at right angles to the 
longitudinal axis of the pin. 
Switch according to claim 9, characterised by having a 
guide for the shaft of the movable contact located underneath 

the extinguishing chamber housing (2). 
Switch according to claim 10, characterised by having at 
least one guide plate
 (12) with a slot (13). 
Switch according to one of claims 1 to 11, characterised 
in that the external diameter of the radially aligned suction 

washer (7) corresponds with a sliding fit to the internal 
diameter of the extinguishing chamber housing (2). 
Switch according to one of claims 1 to 12, characterised 
in that the suction washer (7) is located at such a distance 

from the tip (8) of the contact pin that in the switched-off 
state is spaced from the lower rim (9) of the housing. 
Switch according to one of claims 1 to 13, characterised 
in that the quenching plates (5) are provided with slits, 

indentations, bulges, recesses and/or embossments.
