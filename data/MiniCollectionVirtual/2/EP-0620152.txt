<ABSTRACT>
A pour spout fitment applicator applies a 
flanged pour spout fitment 36 through an opening 20 in 

a carton top panel 22. The applicator includes a 
rotatable shaft 28 having an anvil 46 secured thereto, 

a vacuum cup 48 mounted on the distal end of the anvil 
46, and a cam-controlled pivotable chute segment 40 for 

co-ordinating the supply of one fitment 36 at a time to 
the vacuum cup 48. A linkage-and-toggle system 54 

serves to turn the anvil 46 and the cam 30 so as to 
insert the individual fitment 36 directly into the 

opening 20. While backed-up by the anvil 46, the 
flange 37 of the fitment 36 is sealed by an ultrasonic 

sealer 50 with horn 52 to the inner surface of the top 
panel 22 around the opening 20. The applicator 

operates transversely to the path of movement of a 
single line of cartons 18 along a conveyor 14. Two or 

more applicators may simultaneously apply fitments (36) 
to closely adjacent cartons (18) in the single line.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a container fitment 
applicator and is applicable particularly, but not 
exclusively, to carton forming, filling and sealing 
machines, especially to such machines wherein pour 
spout fitments are applied while the cartons are being 
processed thereon. Forming, filling and sealing machines having 
pour spout applicators at one of the stations 
therealong are known. For example, GB-A-2,238,287 
discloses an application station at which a rotatable 
mandrel or bar is provided, with the mandrel having a 
boss projecting therefrom. A pour spout is placed on 
the boss by external means; as a carton is indexed into 
the application station, the mandrel is turned in the 
direction of the carton travel into the open top of the 
carton, aligning the boss with an opening formed in a 
selected panel of the top closure of the carton; the 
boss and pour spout are moved laterally through the 
opening; the inner flanged end of the pour spout is 
secured, such as by ultrasonic welding, to the inner 
surface around the opening; and the boss is withdrawn 
from the opening and then turned out of the open top. 
An outer cap is attached to the pouring spout before 
assembly. Other pour spout applicators are disclosed 
US-A-4,788,811, wherein a horizontally elongated pour 
spout fitment attaching turret is located upstream of  
 
the usual turret and radial mandrels on which the 
bottom end closure is folded and sealed. The fitment 
attaching turret includes a pusher at one station for 
pushing an open-ended package over a sucker device for 
holding a pour spout fitment and inserting it into an 
opening in a package top panel. The fitment attaching 
turret is then rotated to a second station where an 
anvil is axially received in the package and cooperates 
with an ultrasonic horn for sealing a flange 
of the fitment to the inner surface of the top panel. US-A-4386923 discloses a bag-in-box 
arrangement wherein a fitment is attached to the bag 
which is then inserted through a hole in flap of the 
box, while both are in a collapsed state. According to one aspect of the present 
invention, there is provided an applicator for 
inserting a fitment into a wall of an open-ended 
container, comprising an oscillatory drive member, a 
fitment-holder oscillatable by said drive member 
between a fitment-receiving position in which a fitment 
is loaded into said fitment-holder and a second 
position, and supply means for supplying fitments to 
said fitment-holder at said fitment-receiving position, 
characteris
</DESCRIPTION>
<CLAIMS>
An applicator for inserting a fitment (36) 
into a wall (22) of an open-ended container (16), 

comprising an oscillatory drive member (28), a fitment-holder 
(48) oscillatable by said drive member (28) 

between a fitment-receiving position in which a fitment 
(36) is loaded into said fitment-holder (48) and a 

second position, and supply means (38) for supplying 
fitments (36) to said fitment-holder (48) at said 

fitment-receiving position, characterised in that the 
oscillation of said fitment-holder (48) includes a 

single movement which is a turning movement from said fitment-receiving 
position to a second position during the approach to 

which said fitment-holder (48) inserts said fitment 
(36) into said wall (22). 
An applicator according to claim 1, wherein 
said supply means (38) includes a chute (34) for 

alignedly receiving fitments (36), a pivotable end 
segment (40) of said chute (34) adapted to receive one 

fitment (36) at a time from said chute (34), biassing 
means (43) for urging said end segment (40) toward said 

fitment-holder (48), and an arcuate-camming surface 
(32) of a cam (30) secured to said drive member (28) 

and adapted to return said end segment (40) to 
alignment with said chute (34) against the force of 

said biassing means (43) while an anvil (46) mounting 
said fitment-holder (48) on said drive member (28) is 

being turned into the open-ended container (16).  
 
An applicator according to claim 2, wherein 
said cam (30) and said anvil (46) are secured side-by-side 

on said drive member (28) such that end portions 
thereof enter and leave said open-ended container (16) 

together. 
An applicator according to claim 1, 2, or 3, 
and further comprising a linkage-and-toggle system (54) 

for oscillating said drive member (28). 
An applicator according to any preceding 
claim, and further comprising an ultrasonic sealer (50) 

with retractable horn (52) for sealing said fitment 
(36) to said wall (22) and adapted to engage a surface 

of said wall (22) while the fitment-holder (48) is in 
place behind the fitment (36), thus to weld said 

fitment (36) to the opposite surface of said wall (22). 
In combination, an applicator according to 
any preceding claim, and a conveyor (14) for advancing 

said container (16) into position beneath said fitment-holder

(48) being in a plane transverse to the path of 
movement of the container (16) along said conveyor 

(14). 
A method of inserting a fitment (36) into a 
wall (22) of an open-ended container (16), comprising 

oscillating a fitment-holder (48) between a fitment-receiving 
position and a second position, supplying a 

fitment (36) to said fitment-holder (48) while in its 
fitment-receiving position and turning said fitment-holder  

 
(48) and thus said fitment (36) from said 

fitment-receiving position to said second position in a 
single movement which is a turning movement, characterised in that, during 

the approach of said fitment-holder (48) to said second 
position, it inserts said fitment (36) into said wall
