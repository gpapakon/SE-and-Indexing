<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a sealing arrangement for the gap between the rigid panel of a vehicle roof and the roof opening, in which the panel, which comprises a glass panel, is bonded to a base frame, placed under the edge region and protruding laterally, and between the glass-panel circumference and the roof opening a gap seal is connected to the protruding edge of the base frame. In the case of a sealing arrangement of this kind, for more simple assembly using fewer separate parts, according to the invention it is envisaged that the gap seal (3) have a U-shaped clamping region (13), provided with a reinforcement, made of an elastomer and having a lip-shaped projection (15), which fits over the edge of the glass panel (2), and a sealing lip (17), which is directed towards the peripheral edge of the glass panel (2), on one side of the clamping region (13), and having a hollow-chamber profile (20), which is extruded onto the other side and is made of microcellular rubber, and that the gap seal be clamped by its U-shaped clamping region (13) onto a bent-up edge (12) of the base frame (10).

A sealing arrangement for the gap between the rigid cover (2) of a
vehicle roof and the roof opening (1) in which the cover is a plate of

glass (2) bonded to a baseframe (10) having a rim portion underlay
and protruding at the side with an upswept rim (12), with a

weatherstrip (3) having an elastomeric U-shaped clamping portion
(13;50) clamp-mounted on the protruding rim (12) between the

periphery of said glass plate (2) and said roof opening (1), said
weatherstrip (3) comprising a lipped appendage (15) clasping the

edge of said glass plate (2) and a sponge rubber hollow chamber
profile (20; 56) coextruded to the other side, characterized in that

said weatherstrip (3) is provided with a sealing lip (17; 53) facing
the peripheral edge of said glass plate (2) and with a strengthening

element (14) in said clamping portion (13;50).
The sealing arrangement as set forth in claim 1, characterized in
that said weatherstrip (3) enclosing said glass plate (2) and said

baseframe (10) comprises a profile section (A) extending beyond the
front edge of said cover (2) including a side sealing lip (22; 57)

protruding laterally from said sponge rubber profile (20; 56) to the
roof opening (1) and a profile section (B) extending over the

remaining peripheral portions of said cover (2) with a sealing web
(25;51) protruding perpendicularly from one leg of said U-shaped

clamping portion (13;50) adjoining said sponge rubber profile (20;
56) and that both profile sections (A, B) are durably butt-jointed to

form a one-piece weatherstrip frame (3).
The sealing arrangement as set forth in claim 1, characterized in
that said elastomeric part of said weatherstrip (3) consists of EPDM

having a Shore A hardness of approx. 70. 
The sealing arrangement as set forth in claim 1, characterized in
that said strengthening element of said U-shaped clamping portion

(13;50) consists of a stamped strip (14) vulcanized in place with
slotted openings in the edges.
The sealing arrangement as set forth in claim 1, characterized in
that said lipped appendage (15) comprises a stiffener element (16)

in the form of a strip of aluminum or stamped strip extending up to
above said U-shaped strengthening element (14).
The sealing arrangement as set forth in claim 1, characterized in
that said U-shaped clamping portion (13;50) comprises at its leg on

the side of said glass plate (2) a horizontal appendage (18) facing
said glass plate (2) into which one downswept end (19) of said

strengthening element (14) extends.
The sealing arrangement as set forth in claim 6, characterized in
that said glass plate (2) and said baseframe (10) are joined by

means of an adhesive layer (11) such that also the free end of said
appendage (18) is embedded in said adhesive layer (11).
The sealing arrangement as set forth in claim 1, characterized in
that said sealing lip facing said edge of said glass plate (2) is

configured as a triangular sealing hollow chamber (53) including an
impression notch (54) in its horizontal leg.
The sealing arrangement as set forth in claim 1, characterized in
that said U-shaped clamping portion (13) comprises on its inner side

several, downswept inclined protruding clamping lips (30).
The sealing arrangement as set forth in claim 1, characterized in
that for fixing said U-shaped clamping portion (13) to said upswept

rim (12) of said baseframe (10) U-shaped clips (31, 35) having
outwardly downswept leg ends (32, 36) are provided, said leg ends

(32, 36) protruding into corresponding recesses (33, 37) of said U-shaped
clamping portion (13). 
The sealing arrangement as set forth in claim 1, characterized in
that for fixing said U-shaped clamping portion (13) said upswept rim

(12) comprises a side bulge (40) engaging on the one side a
corresponding recess (41) in one U leg (13) and the other U leg of

which comprises an identical bulge (42) engaging the rear side
recess of said rim (12) produced by said bulge (40).
The sealing arrangement as set forth in claim 1, characterized in
that said U-shaped clamping portion (50) is joinable to said upswept

rim (12) by means of an activatable adhesive (55).
The sealing arrangement as set forth in claim 12, characterized in
that said activatable adhesive layer (55) comprises an internal live

copper strand (56) for activating said adhesive (55).
The sealing arrangement as set forth in claim 12 and 13,
characterized in that said activatable adhesive compound (55) is
