<ABSTRACT>
A hot dedusting system for flue gases of 
incinerators and thermal plants comprising an axial 

cyclone (2,10,12) swept through by the full flow of hot 
flue gas, a parting loop for splitting the flue gas 

flow exiting the axial cyclone into a primary flow at a 
low dust concentration and high flow rate and a 

secondary flow at a high dust concentration and low 
flow rate (about 10% of the overall flow rate) and a 

second filtering stage (3,19,45) for the secondary 
flow, hot primary and secondary flows being admitted 

into a regenerative heat exchanger (5).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a system for 
cleaning high temperature flue gas from incinerators 
and thermal plants of small granulometry dust, which 
enables recovery of the enthalpy of the processed gas 
and affords improved efficiency for the heat 
regenerators. The cleaning of flue gas from an incinerator 
of solid urban waste at a high temperature and of flue 
gas from a thermal plant involves technologies yet not 
fully developed, and wide spectrum problems. The flue gas contains acid substances in a 
molecular state and solid combustion residue particles 
which cannot be released to the ambience because of 
their polluting and toxic effects, and which have 
harmful effects even on the thermal or incinerating 
plant itself. The damping of the flue gas acidity is 
performed downstream of the plant essentially through 
scrubbing towers (or scrubbers) arranged directly 
upstream of the flue gas exhaust chimney. The damping of solid particles entrained with 
the flue gas is performed in several stages.  A first filtration is obtained by subjecting 
the flue gas to sharp path variations, which tends to 
precipitate the particulate of larger size (>50 µ) into 
a collecting chamber. A subsequent filtration is obtained by using 
cyclone strainers generally arranged downstream from 
the plant and followed by electrostatic precipitators 
which complete the filtering process that has 
originated in the cyclone by removing from the flue gas 
small size particles (smaller than about 10 µ) on which 
the centrifugal effect produced by the cyclone is 
ineffective for the purpose of filtration. Any residual particulate from the flue gas is 
held back in the liquid of the scrubbers. Electrostatic precipitators must be placed, 
of necessity, downstream of the plant in an area where 
the flue gas has a comparatively low temperature in the 
200°C range, and the cyclone strainers are preferably 
placed directly upstream. Their location at a section at a higher 
temperature of the flue gas path, while being feasible, 
would require for the cyclone a much more effective and 
expensive thermal insulation and would involve 
considerable heat dissipation, since the temperature of 
the flue gas exiting the combustion chamber is on the  
 
order of 900°C and may be even higher in certain 
thermal plants. It will be apparent, therefore, that all the 
heat exchanger elements in the plant located in the 
path of hot flue gas become swept by gas loaded with 
dust which, as it progressively settles and builds up 
on the same,
