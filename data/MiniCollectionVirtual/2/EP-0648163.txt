<ABSTRACT>
Document sorter of the type in which the successive compartments receiving documents are each bounded by a pair of flaps (3, 4), each successive pair of flaps consisting of a folder produced by folding a generally rectangular sheet (1) of paper, cardboard, blotting paper or similar at its centre, the successive sets of flaps being connected by a back, and each of the flaps, except possibly the last, having a tab (6, 8) for identification and opening purposes, each tab being offset with respect to the preceeding tab and aligned with it. In order to distinguish each of the tabs from preceeding and/or following tabs by colour, the two sides of each of the folders have a different colour.

Document separator of the type in which the 
successive compartments destined to receive documents are each 

delimited by a pair of flaps (3,4), each pair of successive 
flaps (3,4) being itself composed of a folder (1) produced by 

making a central fold in a sheet (1), usually rectangular, of 
paper, card, board or blotting paper, this set of successive 

flaps (3,4) being joined by a spine, and each of the flaps 
possessing a tab (6,8) allowing it to be identified and 

opened, each of these successive tabs (6,8) being shifted in 
relation to the preceding tab while remaining in alignment,
 
   characterised by the fact that
 
   for the purpose of differentiating, by its colour, each 

of the said tabs (6) from that or those which precede or 
follow it (8), the two faces of each of the said sheets (1) 

are of differing colours. 
Sorter according to claim 1, characterised by the 
fact that each of the said folders (1) is made of paper having 

at least two layers of differing colours or at least two 
sheets stuck together of differing colours. 
Sorter according to claims 1 and 2, characterised by 
the fact that the tabs (6,8) are created on the free vertical 

(5,7) and/or horizontal edges of the said flaps (3,4) of each 
folder (1).
