<ABSTRACT>
The present invention relates to a plating method, plating 
liquid and plated component of an engine, in particular 

internal combustion engine, wherein high speed plating is 
performed by means of using a nickel plating liquid containing 

phosphorus and a dispersed eutectoid substance wherein sodium 
is additionally incorporated into said liquid.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a plating method for the high
speed nickel plating a liquid and a eutectoid substance, and
to an engine component, in particular cylinder, having an
interior surface on which a plated layer is formed with the
use of the plating liquid.Hitherto a technique has been generally known in which a
surface of a work is plated by impressing an electric
voltage between an electrode and the work while allowing a
plating liquid to be present between the electrode and the
work. (DE 39 37 763 C2, FR 2 685 924 A1) various high speed
plating methods have been also envisaged for enhancing the
deposition speed of the plating.There is a kind of plated coating which contains a dispersed eutectoid
substance. In particular, a Ni-P-SiC plated coating which contains nickel and
phosphorus and in which silicon carbide eutectoid is dispersed is effective
as a plating on, for example, an interior peripheral surface of a cylinder
of a cylinder block of an engine formed of an aluminum cast alloy.Namely, it has thus far been known to form a cylinder wall by plating,
rather than by providing a cylinder liner, an inside peripheral surface of a
cylinder of a cylinder block formed of an aluminum cast alloy (see, for
example, Japanese Patent Publication No. 1-52480). In this case, while
chrome plating has been predominantly adopted, the above-mentioned Ni-P-SiC
plating, among other things, gives excellent characteristics such as in
lubricity and coefficient of friction as described hereinafter. In such plating, too, there is a demand for increasing the speed of the
plating deposition. By a mere technique such as by increasing the electric
current density while allowing the plating liquid containing phosphorus and a
eutectoid-forming substance to flow, however, it is difficult to attain a
high quality, dispersed eutectoid-containing plating which can satisfy the
demand, because the formation of dispersed eutectoid substance is not
accelerated so that the amount of the eutectoid substance and the content of
phosphorus in the deposition layer are decreased, though the deposition speed
of nickel is increased. Thus, the conventional plating with the formation
of dispersed eutectoid is unavoidably performed with a low deposition speed.With the foregoing circumstances in view, it is an objective
of the present invention to provide a plating method which
permits the formation of a desired, high quality nickel
plating containing phosphorus and a dispersed eutectoid
substance at a high speed. Moreover, it is an objective
