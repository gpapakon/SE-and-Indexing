Novel polymer compositions that comprise high 
1,2-enrichment are described herein. Said polymer 

compositions have up to about 50% by weight of 1,2 units 
wherein about 25% to about 75% by weight of all 1,2 units 

are present in the polymer backbone. Additionally a novel

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to novel polymer 
compositions. Particularly, the polymer compositions 
described herein are high 1,2-enriched polybutadiene 
latices as well as homologs derived therefrom. Moreover, 
said invention describes a process for producing the above-mentioned 
polymer compositions. For many years, the natives of South and Central 
America found use for a latex obtained from the barks of 
certain trees. Said latex was often a cis- or trans-1,4-polyisoprene 
and it was recovered from rubber trees via a 
tapping process similar to the one used to recover maple 
sugar. In the early nineteenth century, individuals such 
as Hancock in England and Goodyear in the United States 
discovered that mixing natural rubber with sulfur yielded a 
moldable composition which could be vulcanized and 
converted to a variety of commercial products. Such 
commercial products included waterproof coats and boots 
as well as solid tires for transportation vehicles. In the period between World Wars I and II, the 
development of synthetic rubbers was pursued; especially in 
the United States. During this period, a program was 
instituted to produce synthetic rubbers such as styrenebutadiene 
(SBR) which resulted in a decrease in America's  
 
dependence on rubber imports as well as an increase in 
synthetic polymer production. Presently, synthetic polymers such as 
acrylonitrile-butadiene-styrene copolymers (ABS) are 
produced by grafting monomers onto a rubbery polymer 
backbone in a latex. In the case of ABS, acrylonitrile and 
styrene are frequently, grafter onto rubbery polybutadiene 
and/or a rubbery styrene-butadiene copolymer in a latex. 
Prior to grafting, said latex of rubbery polybutadiene is 
generally admixed with the monomers to be grafted thereon 
and the mixture is usually agitated for a period of up to 
several hours to emulsify the monomers and to enable the 
rubbery polymer to absorb them before initiating the 
grafting reaction. Typically, the above-mentioned rubbery 
backbone polymer is prepared via processes that subject, 
for instance, butadiene to catalysts of the alfin or 
amylsodium type. More typically, polybutadiene latices are 
produced by emulsion polymerization techniques that 
employ an aqueous emulsion of butadiene, an anionic 
emulsifier and a free radical initiator. The polymer 
backbones produced by the processes described above 
consist of usually about 80% by weight of 1,4-polybutadiene 
units (1,4-enrichment) and about 20% by weight of 1,2-polybutadiene 
units based on total
