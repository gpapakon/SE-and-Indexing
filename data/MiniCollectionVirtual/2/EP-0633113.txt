<ABSTRACT>
A process for producing a double-layer film on a flat 
substrate by reactive casting employing two kinds of 

reaction-curable resin raw material mixtures 
substantially free from a solvent, which comprises 

casting onto the substrate a first unreacted liquid raw 
material mixture for the first layer, then casting onto 

the first layer a second unreacted liquid raw material 
mixture for the second layer while the first raw material 

mixture still retains its fluidity, and thereafter curing 
by reaction the two layers simultaneously.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a process for
producing a double-layer film having excellent
interlaminar bond strength.EP-A 451 030 discloses a process for producing a double-layer film on a
substrate by reactive casting employing two kinds of reaction-curable resin
raw material mixtures.Heretofore, a process for producing a double-layer
film by supplying unreacted liquid raw materials onto a
substrate, has been proposed in Japanese Unexamined
Patent Publication No. 162618/1981, USP 4,935,264 and USP
5,084,325. However, in such a conventional process, a
raw material for the first layer supplied on the
substrate, is reacted for curing, and after the curing of
the first layer, a raw material for the second layer is
supplied. Therefore, the adhesion between the two layers
tends to be inadequate. Accordingly, delamination at the
interface is likely to occur due to a load such as a
tension or swelling. Especially, after various
durability tests, a marked decrease in the adhesive
strength and interfacial delamination are observed. This
causes a serious problem in practical use. Further, since the respective layers have different
refractive indexes, an optical distortion in light
transmittance takes place at the interface. Therefore,
this process is not suitable as a practical process for
the production of a film which is required to have a high
optical quality.Further, it is difficult to make the first layer thin
in a case where the substrate is coated with a release
agent, because dewetting occurs on the substrate during
the curing reaction after the casting of the raw material
for the first layer.It is an object of the present invention to provide a
new process for producing a double-layer film, whereby
the above-mentioned problems of the conventional process
can be solved. Namely, the object of the present
invention is to provide a process for producing a double-layer
film by casting unreacted liquid raw material
mixtures onto a substrate and then reacting and curing
them, whereby the adhesive strength between the two
layers is increased and at the same time, an optical
distortion is reduced, and the first layer can be made
thin.Thus, the present invention provides a process for
producing a double-layer film on a substrate coated with a release agent, by
reactive casting employing two kinds of reaction-curable resing raw material
mixtures substantially free from a solvent, which comprises casting onto the
substrate a first unreacted liquid raw material mixture for the first layer, then
casting onto the
