<ABSTRACT>
This invention provides an image processing device 
which is capable of discriminating an edge even on a 

faint image by changing the edge discriminating 
parameters according to the gray-level values set in 

its control portion. An edge discriminating circuit 
(34) discriminates an edge on an image and a gray-level 

converting portion (35) then conducts gray-level 
conversion of the image and determines changeable set 

values of gray-levels. After this an edge 
discriminating circuit (36) conducts the discrimination 

of an edge of the image. In this case the set values of 
gray-levels are given to the adge discriminating 

circuit (36) to enable the latter to easily 
discriminate the edge portion having a low variation 

when the image has lowered gray-levels.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an image
processing device and, more particularly, to an image
processing device which is capable of discriminating an
edge portion from a non-edge portion in an image by
specifing the parameters according to quantized data
obtained by gray-level (half-tone) image processing
and, furthermore, of accurately discrimination an edge
portion on faint image by changing the discriminating
parameters of the edge portion on the image according
to gray-level settings by means of its control portion.
The device may be used, for example, in a digital type,
plain paper copier and an image printer.In the conventional processing of gray-level
images, quantized image data is directly printed out.
For instance, image data input as digital information
includes pixels each having a gray-level in the range
of, e.g., 0 to 255. This means that a stream of 8 bits
is required to represent each pixel having a gray-level
in the range of 0 to 255 if no additional
processing is done. A tremendous memory capacity may be
required to store whole image data. In addition, there
must be a printer which is capable of reproducing 
images of gray-levels that vary from 0 to 255.The present invention provides an image processing
device to reproduce scanned images of the gray-level
described by generally available printers having a low
memory capacity and relatively low power for
reproducing the gray shades of an image, it is
necessary to reduce the amount of information carried
by a pixel and to decrease the number of gray shades
of each pixel.The processing procedure begins with the reading
image data having gray-levels of pixels from 0 to
255. The read-in data is quantized for gray-levels of
0 to 255.For instance, the gray levels (0 to 255) of the
data are quantized at points W, X, Y and Z. The
quantization is made for discriminating input data "f"
with reference to the preset threshold values t1, t2
and t3 as follows:
W if 255 ≧ f > t1;X if t1 ≧ f > t2;Y if t2 ≧ f > t3;Z if t3 ≧ f ≧ t0.However, each set of data only quantized may not
faithfully represent the gray-levels of local portions
on the original, resulting therefore in lacking
smoothness of representation of the image. To eliminate 
the above-mentioned local defect, the difference
between the gray-levels of the image and of the
original which occurred in the quantization process, is
detected as an error that is processed to give an
effect to the gray-levels of the pixels around an
attentional one. The gray-levels in the detail of the
original image
