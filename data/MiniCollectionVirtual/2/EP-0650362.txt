<DESCRIPTION>
 ANTIVIRAL COMBINATIONSThe present invention relates to combinations of antiviral agents. More specifically it is concerned with combinations of 1 ,3-oxathiolane nucleoside analogues with other antiviral agents, in particular agents effective against HIV.Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) causes a variety of clinical conditions including the acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) and chronic neurological disorders. Nucleosides such as AZT, ddC and ddl inhibit HIV replication in vitro, and appear to exert their antiviral activity on the virus-encoded reverse transcriptase enzyme after metabolism by the cell to their 5'-triphosphate derivatives.AZT reduces morbidity and mortality in patients with AIDS. However, HIV infection of cells results in integration of the virus genome into the host chromosome, and so it has been necessary to continue AZT treatment for long periods of time. The consequences of long-term AZT therapy are associated bone-marrow toxicity and the appearance of AZT-resistant variants of HIV-1. Similarly, some AIDS patients treated with ddC develop peripheral neuropathy and ddl has been shown to induce pancreatitis and peripheral neuropathy.The use of combinations of compounds may give rise to an equivalent antiviral effect with reduced toxicity, or an increase in drug efficacy if synergy between compounds occurs. Lower overall drug doses will possibly also reduce the frequency of occurrence of drug-resistant variants of HIV. Many different methods have been used to examine the effects of combinations of compounds acting together in different assay systems. All of these methods have limitations and for example, some methods have been applied to systems other than those for which they were derived. AZT demonstrates synergistic antiviral activity in vitro in combination with agents that act at HIV-1 replicative steps other than reverse transcription, including recombinant soluble CD4 castanospermine and recombinant interferon alpha. However, it must be noted that combinations of compounds can give rise to increased cytotoxicity. AZT and recombinant 

interferon alpha have an increased cytotoxic effect on normal human bone marrow progenitor cells.The compound (2R. cis)-4-amino-1-(2-hvdroxvmethvl-1.3-oxathiolan-5-vl) -(1H)- pyridmidin-2-one, also known as 3TC, is currently undergoing clinical trials for the treatment of conditions associated with infection by HIV.We have now found that 3TC exhibits unexpected advantages when used in combination with certain non-nucleoside inhibtors of HIV
