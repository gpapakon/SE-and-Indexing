<ABSTRACT>
The optical method for analysing substances relies on the measurement of the propagation properties of optical surface waves on sensor surfaces. Light waves channelled through an optically conducting (wave-conducting) layer structure which is in contact with a sample are coupled out with a grating coupler. The coupling region of the grating coupler is formed by a spatial-resolution detector, so that the plane of the optically conducting layer structure forms the object plane and the detection plane lies in the image plane of the optical image formation. The light distribution of the wave field coupled out which results during image formation is measured using the detector and is used for determining the analytical measurement quantity. The device for implementing the method consists of a suitable optically conducting sensor (1, 2) with grating coupler (3), image formation optics (9) and an optical detector (10).
