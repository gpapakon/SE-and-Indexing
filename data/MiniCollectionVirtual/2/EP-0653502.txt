<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a zinc-containing 
metal-plated composite steel article and a 
method of producing the same. More particularly, the present invention 
relates to a zinc-containing metal-plated composite steel 
article having an excellent paint-coating property, 
especially an excellent close paint-adherence property 
for an electrodeposition paint-coating, and enabling the 
paint-coated article to exhibit an excellent corrosion 
resistance, and a method of producing the same. It is well known that a steel strip plated with 
a metal containing zinc and having enhanced resistance to 
perforating corrosion and red rust, which will be 
referred to as a zinc-containing metal-plated steel strip 
hereinafter, is popularly employed as a motorcar body-forming 
steel strip. Recently, to further enhance the corrosion 
resistance, the thickness of the zinc-containing metal-plating 
layer on the steel strip tends to be further 
increased. However, the conventional zinc-containing metal 
plated steel strip which has been treated with a 
phosphate, and then coated with a paint, is 
disadvantageous in that when it is practically employed 
in a wetted environment, the paint-coating film on the 
steel strip is easily blistered. As a conventional attempt for solving the 
above-mentioned problem, Japanese Examined Patent 
Publication (Kokoku) No. 5-5905 discloses a plated steel 
strip produced by coating a surface of a zinc-containing  
 
alloy or aluminum-containing alloy layer plated on a 
steel strip with a specific amount of a nickel-iron alloy 
deposited by an anodic electrolysis, and having an 
applicability to a chemical conversion treatment, for 
example, phosphate treatment. This method is carried out 
by utilizing the anodic electrolysis, and thus is 
disadvantageous in that the necessary equipment is 
expensive, and the running cost is high due to the 
consumption of electric power. As another attempt, Japanese Unexamined Patent 
Publication (Kokai) No. 2-228,482 discloses a method of 
forming a zinc phosphate coating having an enhanced 
paint-coating property by treating a metal surface with 
an acidic aqueous zinc phosphate solution having an 
isoelectric point of 3 or less and containing colloidal 
particles having a dispersed particle size of 0.1 µm or 
less. This method is, however, disadvantageous in that 
the necessary treating time is too long and thus the 
production cost becomes too high, and the productivity is 
low. Under the above-mentioned circumstance of the 
prior art, there is a
