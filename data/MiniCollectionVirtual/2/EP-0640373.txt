<ABSTRACT>
A dry spray tower unattended by generation of waste 
water has a top provided with a gas inlet port, an expanded 

portion extending downwardly from the top while gradually 
enlarges, and spray nozzles attached to the expanded 

portion or a portion immediately downstream from the 
expanded portion to spray water and/or an absorbing 

solution, thereby cooling and moistening a gas and/or 
removing a harmful component from the gas, wherein a gas 

distributing device is disposed in or around the expanded 
portion at a position upstream from the spray nozzles for 

making the downward component of flow velocity of the gas 
faster at the peripheral portion of the spray tower than 

at the central portion thereof, whereby sprayed liquid 
droplets are prevented from colliding with the inner wall 

of the tower.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a spray tower
for cooling, moistening and/or purifying a gas. More
particularly, the present invention relates to a dry spray
tower and method whereby water and/or an absorbing solution
is sprayed by a spray nozzle attached in the vicinity of
the top of the spray tower, thereby cooling and moistening
a gas and/or removing a harmful component from the gas
without producing waste water.To cool and moisten a gas and/or remove a harmful
component from the gas, a dry spray tower has heretofore
been used. Fig. 5, for example, shows a typical
conventional dry spray tower in which the gas 5a is
introduced into the tower from the top 1 thereof through
an expanded portion 2 and sprayed with water and/or
an absorbing solution by a spray nozzle 4 attached in
the vicinity of the top of the tower, and in which the
sprayed water and/or absorbing solution is completely
evaporated in the tower so that no waste water is produced.
In such a spray tower, a swirling motion is often given
to the gas when introduced into the tower.The conventional technique suffers, however, from
the problem that liquid droplets sprayed in the vicinity
of the top of the spray tower collide with the inner wall
of the tower and the liquid flows down as far as the
bottom, resulting in waste water.That is, in the conventional spray tower, as shown
in Fig. 5, the flow velocity of gas is relatively fast in
the central portion of the tower at a position immediately
downstream from an expanded portion 2 through which the
exhaust gas is introduced into the tower, whereas it is
relatively slow in the peripheral portion of the tower.
Therefore, at the downstream side of the expanded portion
2, the gas whirls up from the central portion toward 
the peripheral portion of the tower as shown by an arrow
5b. As a result, sprayed liquid droplets collide with
the inner wall of the tower, giving rise to problems as
described above. In particular, when the temperature of
the exhaust gas, after the sprayed water and/or absorbing
solution has evaporated, is lower than the dew point of
the gas plus 50° C, it is difficult for liquid droplets
having collided with the inner wall to re-evaporate.
Therefore, there is a very strong possibility that the
liquid droplets colliding with the inner wall will flow
down as far as the bottom to become waste water. Further,
when the gas contains dust, the dust adheres to the inner
wall wetted with the liquid droplets.Further, in a case where a swirling motion is
given to the gas when introduced
