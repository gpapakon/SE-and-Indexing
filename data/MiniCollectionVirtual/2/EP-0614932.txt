<ABSTRACT>
A method of regenerating waste polyvinyl chloride according to the 
present invention includes the steps of bringing polyvinyl chloride-containing 

industrial waste into contact with a solvent in which polyvinyl chloride 
can be dissolved, to elute polyvinyl chloride from the industrial waste, removing 

substances which cannot be dissolved in this solvent from a polyvinyl 
chloride solution consisting of the solvent and the polyvinyl chloride dissolved 

therein, and recovering regenerated polyvinyl chloride as a substance 
left over when the solvent is removed from the polyvinyl solution. The industrial 

waste to be regenerated includes polyvinyl chloride chips obtained from 
waste electric wires, polyvinyl chloride-impregnated wall paper and used agricultural 

polyvinyl chloride sheets. The solvent used in the present invention 
consists of at least one kind of organic solvent selected from the group 

composed of methyl ethyl ketone, methyl isobutyl ketone and dioctyl phthalate.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a technology for resource 
reutilization of plastics from industrial waste products that 
contain plastics. More particularly, the present invention relates 
to a method and apparatus for reclamation of waste polyvinyl 
chloride from industrial waste products that contain polyvinyl 
chloride, the efficient reclamation of which has been considered 
difficult, although such waste accounts for a large proportion of 
industrial waste products. Based on the principal involved, conventional waste 
polyvinyl chloride reclamation technology can be divided into the 
flushing separation method (used in the flushing-type separator) in 
which separation is effected by differences in the specific gravity 
of the materials concerned, and the hot screening method of 
separation (used in the hot screening separator). In the case of 
used agricultural polyvinyl chloride sheet, flushing separation is 
the principal reclamation method used. This reclamation method 
uses the preprocessing steps of cutting, crushing and screening. 
Among the problems associated with the flushing separation method 
are that of low efficiency, low quality, and, in addition, because  
 
it requires large quantities of water, securing the necessary water 
and processing of the contaminated waste are also problems. As a 
result, used agricultural polyvinyl chloride sheet is usually 
disposed of by burning it in the open, discarding it in rivers, 
burying it and so forth, making it a major source of environmental 
pollution. Processing using hot screening separators is used mainly for 
scrap electrical cable. The process consists of melting the 
polyvinyl chloride layer of the cable and passing it through a #60 
to #100 mesh screen. As such, it is a high temperature, high 
pressure process, while the high viscosity of the material being 
processed is further problem. A further problem is that the 
polyvinyl chloride scrap material to which the process can be 
applied is limited to that in which there is a very low ratio of 
substances that do not melt at high temperatures such as scrap 
copper, scrap rubber, scrap polyethylene, waste paper and the like.
 
   Thus, in practice electrical cable scrap and other such industrial 
waste products are disposed of by burial, and this has created an 
environmental pollution problem of major proportions. On the other hand, while reclamation methods could be used 
based on the use of solvents to separate out plastic components, as 
yet no system apparatuses based on such
