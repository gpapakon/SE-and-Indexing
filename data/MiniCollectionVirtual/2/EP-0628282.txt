<ABSTRACT>
A blood sampling device comprises a lancet member (11) and a sleeve member (12). The lancet member (11) is provided on one end with a button member (30) and on its other end with a projecting blade section (24) of a lancet (23). The sleeve member (12) is designed for accommodation and axial guidance of the lancet member (11). It is provided on one end with an annular flange (45) which is held at a first distance from the button member (30) by a stop, which can be mechanically overcome, in a first use position of the device, such that the blade section (24) is located inside the sleeve member (12). The button member (30) and the annular flange (45) can be brought together abruptly into a second use position, by overcoming the stop, at a second smaller distance from one another, so that the blade section (24) projects from the other end of the sleeve member (12). The stop, which can be overcome mechanically, is designed as an intended breaking point. Furthermore, for the selective adjustment of the first distance there are at least two spacers which alternatively create a different second distance in the second use position. Furthermore, a protective element is attached to the lancet member. This protective element covers the blade section and can be released therefrom by finger force. At the same time, the protective element projects from the other end of the sleeve member (12) before use of the device and can be gripped there by the fingers. Finally, the invention describes a method of producing such a blood sampling device.
