<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to terminal blocks and 
more particularly to a terminal block of the type which 
incorporates overvoltage protection for such as 
telecommunications conductors which are terminated or 
interconnected at the terminal block. Terminal blocks are utilized in the telecommunications 
industry to provide an interconnection point for the individual 
line pair conductors of multi-pair cables. Such terminal blocks 
may provide interconnections between cables from the central 
office and subscriber cables or interconnections between a 
central office cable and a multi-pair cable servicing a local 
area such as a housing subdivision. Some terminal blocks utilize insulation displacement 
connector (IDC) terminal clips or connectors. This type of 
connector automatically pierces the insulation of a portion of 
the wire to establish an electrical connection when the wire is 
inserted therein by means of a suitable tool, and usually a hand  
 
tool specially designed for this purpose. One particularly 
useful terminal block of this type is illustrated and described 
for example in prior U.S. patent no. 4,652,070. This patent discloses a terminal block which 
advantageously utilizes activators which are captively mounted 
in the terminal block and associated with each IDC terminal clip 
to accomplish connection of a conductor with the clip, in place 
of the special hand tool normally required for this purpose. A 
second wire connection to each terminal clip in blocks of this 
type is accomplished by a wire wrap operation. Thus, the 
opposite end of this terminal clip generally comprises a wire 
wrap post which projects outwardly toward the opposite side of 
the terminal block. Generally speaking, terminal blocks of this 
type are preconnectorized. That is, an appropriate cable stub 
is provided, having its respective conductors factory prewired 
to the respective wire wrap terminals of the terminal clips 
within the block. Heretofore, overvoltage or overcurrent protection for 
such terminal blocks has been separately provided. That is, 
separate protector modules mounted on a separate block have 
generally been provided, requiring hand wiring of individual 
protectors of the protector block to individual terminals of the 
terminal block. However, in U.S. patent no. 4,846,735, an 
arrangement is provided for plug-in protector modules which are 
plugged into the upper surface of a terminal block which has been 
especially constructed to receive the protector modules. In this 
arrangement, the
