<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a reluctance motor having a ferromagnetic stationary component (3) and having a ferromagnetic component (5) which can move with respect to this stationary component (3), which components have an airgap (4) between pole surfaces (3c, 5c), which are opposite one another spaced apart, of salient pole parts (3b, 5b), one of the components being provided with excitation coils which enclose ferromagnetic cores (3a, 3b) which produce a ferromagnetic connection between the pole parts (3b, 5b) of this component, the cross-sections of the ferromagnetic cores (3a, 5a) being dimensioned such that they saturate magnetically at the same time as the salient pole parts (3b, 5b) when they are magnetised by the excitation current.

<CLAIMS>
A reluctance motor having a ferromagnetic stationary member (3) and a 
ferromagnetic member (5) which is movable relative thereto, which exhibit an air gap 

(4) between spaced-apart pole faces (3c, 5c) of salient pole parts (3b, 5b), one of the 
members being provided with excitation coils, which surround ferromagnetic cores (3a, 

5a) providing a ferromagnetic coupling between the pole parts (3b, 5b) of said one 
member, 
characterised in that
 the ferromagnetic cores (3a, 5a) are dimensioned to have 
such cross-sections that during the magnetisation of said cores by the excitation current 

the cores are magnetically saturated at the same time as the salient pole parts (3b, 5b).
