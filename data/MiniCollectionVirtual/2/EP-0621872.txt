<DESCRIPTION>
A HUMAN KUNITZ-TYPE PROTEASE INHIBITOR VARIANTFIELD OF INVENTIONThe present invention relates to a variant of a human Kunitz- type protease inhibitor domain, DNA encoding the variant, a method of producing the variant and a pharmaceutical composition containing the variant.BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTIONPolymorphonuclear leukocytes (neutrophils or PMNs) and mononuclear phagocytes (monocytes) play an important part in tissue injury, infection, acute and chronic inflammation and wound healing. The cells migrate from the blood to the site of inflammation and, following appropriate stimulation, they release oxidant compounds (02» , 02-, H202 and H0C1) as well as granules containing a variety of proteolytic enzymes. The secretory granules contain, i.a., alkaline phosphatase, metalloproteinases such as gelatinase and collagenase and serine proteases such as neutrophil elastase, cathepsin G and proteinase 3.Latent metalloproteinases are released together with tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase (TIMP) . The activation mechanism has not been fully elucidated, but it is likely that oxidation of thiol groups and/or proteolysis play a part in the process. Also, free metalloproteinase activity is dependent on inactivation of TIMP.In the azurophil granules of the leukocytes, the serine proteases neutrophil elastase, cathepsin G and proteinase-3 are packed as active enzymes complexed with glucosaminoglycans. These complexes are inactive but dissociate on secretion to release the active enzymes. To neutralise the protease activity, large amounts of the inhibitors α.,-proteinase inhibitor (α.,-PI) 

 and α.,-chymotrypsin inhibitor (c-^-Chl) are found in plasma. However, the PMNs are able to inactivate the inhibitors locally. Thus, ,-PI which is the most important inhibitor of neutrophil elastase is sensitive to oxidation at the reactive centre (Met- 358) by oxygen metabolites produced by triggered PMNs. This reduces the affinity of 0.,,-PI for neutrophil elastase by approximately 2000 times.After local neutralisation of o^-PI, the elastase is able to degrade a number of inhibitors of other proteolytic enzymes. Elastase cleaves α.,-ChI and thereby promotes cathepsin G activity. It also cleaves TIMP, resulting in tissue degradation by metalloproteinases. Furthermore, elastase cleaves antithrombin III and heparin cofactor II, and tissue factor pathway inhibitor (TFPI) which probably promotes clot formation. On the other hand, the ability of neutrophil elastase to degrade coagulation factors is assumed to have the opposite
