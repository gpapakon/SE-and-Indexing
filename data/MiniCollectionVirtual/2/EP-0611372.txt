<ABSTRACT>
Water soluble salt or acid forms of a transition metal phthalocyanine of formula (I) where M is a transition metal, X is H, alkyl, alkoxy, halide or X's together form -C4H4-, each R is a ligand with a solubilizing group, and Q is N or -CY- where Y is H, alkyl, alkoxy or halide, are surprisingly active in tests indicating photodynamic properties. Novel compounds, preparative methods and pharmaceutical compositions are included.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention concerns photosensitizers, more particularly it
concerns novel transition metal photosensitizers.In the photodynamic therapy of cancer, certain dye compounds
(eg, hematoporphyrin derivative, chloroaluminum phthalocyanine sulfonate)
are administered to a tumor-bearing subject. To some extent these dye
compounds are taken up by the tumor tissue and upon selective irradiation
with the appropriate light source the tumor tissue is destroyed via the dye
mediated photo-generation of toxic species such as singlet oxygen. A large number of phthalocyanine (Pc) derivatives have been proposed
as potential photodynamic therapeutic (PDT) agents. Most biological studies on Pc
compounds related to PDT have been conducted with water soluble sulfonated
metallo-phthalocyanines (as reported by Rosenthal,I, Photochem Photobiol 53(6),
859-870, (1991)). These compounds are generally obtained by sulfonation of the
appropriate metallo-phthalocyanine or by template synthesis using the appropriate
sulfonated precursors and a metal salt. Both template synthesis and direct sulfonation
results in mixtures of Pc's containing a variety of isomers and/or different degrees of
sulfonation. This is a particular disadvantage with respect to pharmaceutical
applications, in that drug regulatory agencies are increasingly stringent in their
requirements for substantially pure compounds.Metallated Pc's have been found to have superior photosensitizing
activity compared to metal-free Pc's when the metal is a main group element having a
filled d shell (eg, Al, Zn, Sn, In). It has been reported by Chan, W S, et al, Photochem
Photobiol, 45, 757-761 (1987), that transition metal complexes of Pc's have been found
to be inactive (eg, Cu, Co, Ni, VO, Pd).Certain axially-substituted Ru phthalocyanines are known, eg from
Chem Abs 104:101 140s, from Chem Abs 95:34537g, and Chem Abs 93:71 927p, but
none are disclosed with solubilising functions on such axial ligands. USP 4,851,403 (Johnson Matthey) discloses certain radiation-sensitizing
Co(III) complexes of porphyrins. The complexes are water-soluble, with
solubilising moieties on the periphery of the porphyrin molecule.There remains a need for novel photosensitizers which can be
prepared in isomerically pure form and which show a good level of activity.The present invention provides novel transition metal
phthalocyanine-type derivatives of formula I, 

wherein
M is a second or third row transition metal with a d6 low-spin
electronic configuration,X is hydrogen, alkyl, alkoxy, halide or
