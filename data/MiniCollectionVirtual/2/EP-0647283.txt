<ABSTRACT>
Two pairs of blade units (6, 7) fitted with vertical blades (8) are arranged in a frame (1) so as to move up and down in mutually opposite directions. Each blade unit of a pair is connected to a crank drive (15) via a lever (18) on one side which is linked in a stable position to the frame and articulated on the blade unit and a lever arrangement (19) on the other so that the pairs of blade units (6, 7) can be synchronously moved up and down. The lever arrangement (19) has a lever (24) and a guide rod (27) whereby the lever (24) is connected via the guide rod to either the frame or the blade unit. This arrangement allows the device to do without a sliding guide system for the blade unit and ensures reliable operation at high speeds.

Shedding device for a weaving machine, having a frame (1), two pairs of blade
units (6, 7) that can be moved up and down in mutually opposite directions, lifting

blades (8) that are connected to the pair of blade units, a crank mechanism (15) for
each blade unit, which crank mechanisms are arranged at both ends of each blade

unit, and a lever system (18, 19) that connects the crank mechanism (15) to the blade
unit so as to move each blade unit up and down, characterised in that each blade unit

(6, 7) is connected, on the one hand, to a driven lever (18) and, on the other hand, to
a lever arrangement (19, 35), the driven lever (18) being articulated to the frame (1) at

a fixed position and to the blade unit, and the lever arrangement (19, 35) has a driven
lever (24, 36) and a guide rod (27, 37), the driven lever (24, 36) being connected by

way of the guide rod (27, 37) to the frame (1) or to the blade unit (6, 7).
Device according to claim 1, characterised in that the lever (24) of the lever
arrangement (19) is articulated to the blade unit, and the guide rod (27) is, on the one

hand, articulated to the frame (1) at a fixed position and, on the other hand,
connected in articulated manner to the lever (24).
Device according to claim 1, characterised in that the lever (36) of the lever
arrangement (35) is articulated to the frame (1) at a fixed position, and the guide rod

(37) is connected in articulated manner, on the one hand, to the lever (36) and, on the
other hand, to the blade unit.
Device according to claim 1, characterised in that the crank mechanisms (15)
are associated in pairs with a pair of blade units (6, 7) and are arranged on a shaft

(10) at both ends of each pair of blade units in such a manner that each pair of blade
units (6, 7) can be moved synchronously up and down at the ends.
Device according to claim 4, characterised in that the crank mechanism (15)
has a driving crank (16) and a connecting rod (17). 
Device according to claim 5, characterised in that the lever (18) and/or the
lever arrangement (19, 35) is/are connected to the connecting rod (17) 
via
 an
adjusting device (20, 21) so as to adjust the pivoting angle in such a manner that the

lifting height of the ends of each pair of blade units (6, 7) is either identical, so as to
form a parallel shed, or can be adjusted to be different, so as to form an oblique shed.
Device according to any one of claims 1 to 6, characterised in that the lifting
blade (8) is fixedly connected to a support (30) that is articulated to the blade unit.
Device according to claim 7, characterised in that the lifting blade (8) is guided
at least at the ends in a guide arrangement (31) which is attached to the frame (1).
Device according to claim 1, characterised in that a drive wheel (11) is
attached to each shaft (10), which drive wheels are drivingly connected 
via
 a
kinematic element (12) so as to drive the crank mechanisms (15) synchronously.
Weaving machine comprising a device according to any one of claims 1 to 9.
