<ABSTRACT>
A field programmable gate array (FPGA) includes a distributed switch 
matrix for programmably connecting the various routing conductors. The distributed 

switch matrix comprises groups of additional conductors (e.g., 305, 306, 307), 
referred to as "Switching R-nodes". The Switching R-nodes programmably connect 

selected ones of the (e.g, horizontal) routing conductors (e.g., 301, 302, 303, 304) to 
other selected ones of the (e.g., vertical) routing conductors (e.g., 308, 309, 310, 311, 

312). In this manner, the direct connection between the routing conductors may be 
avoided, allowing for a reduced number of programmable interconnect devices. In 

one preferred embodiment, a nibble-mode architecture is used, wherein four data 
conductors are provided for each group of routing conductors, with other multiples-of-four 

data conductors also being advantageous.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention concerns an integrated circuit that implements a 
field programmable gate array (FPGA). Integrated circuits (ICs) have traditionally implemented a single 
function, or else functions that were defined by software programming. However, in 
either case, the logic architecture that implemented the functionality was fixed 
during the design of the IC. More recently, integrated circuits have been developed 
whose logic architecture can be changed after manufacture. For example, 
Programmable Logic Devices (PLDs) and Field Programmable Gate Arrays 
(FPGAs) have been developed whose logic functions can be established by the user. 
One type of FPGA implementation is shown, for example, in U. S. patent 4,870,302. 
Referring to Fig. 1, a typical FPGA architecture is illustrated. The logic functions 
are typically done in Programmable Function Units (PFUs) 100, 101, 102, 103, 
which are alternatively referred to by workers in the art as Configurable Logic 
Blocks (CLBs). Each PFU includes various logic circuit elements (AND gates, OR 
gates, NAND gates, NOR gates, flip-flops, multiplexers, registers, latches, and tri-state 
buffers, for example) that may be connected in a desired arrangement in order 
to implement desired logic and memory functions. For example, typical logic 
functions include combinatorial logic, adders, counters, and other data path 
functions. Furthermore, the connections between the PFUs may also be established 
as desired. Some of the means used or proposed for establishing the desired 
connectivity within and/or between PFUs include fuses, anti-fuses, and pass 
transistors controlled by program registers or electronically-erasable programmable 
read-only memories (EEPROMs), for example. As illustrated in Fig. 1, the PFUs are connected together by Routing 
Nodes (R-nodes), being illustratively the conductors in groups 104, 105, 106 and 
107. In addition, Configurable Interconnect Points (CIPs) are used to connect two or 
more R-nodes together. The CIPs may be grouped as C-blocks (e.g., 108) and S-blocks 
(e.g., 109), whose functions are described below. Due to their symmetric 
layout, FPGAs may conceptually be divided into more or less identical blocks of 
circuitry called Programmable Logic Cells (PLCs). For example, a given PLC (117) 
typically includes a single PFU (101), and the associated R-nodes and CIPs as  
 
described above. Around the periphery of the integrated circuit are programmable 
Input/Output cells (e.g., 111, 112), also referred to as "PIC" herein.
