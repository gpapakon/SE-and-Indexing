<ABSTRACT>
A light-scattering coating comprising light-scattering 
particles, such as alumina, dispersed in a 

silica matrix is formed by applying to the filter a 
silicone solution in which is dispersed colloidal 

silica and the light-scattering particles to a suitable 
substrate and then pyrolyzing the dispersion at high 

temperature to drive off the organic components and 
form the silica matrix. This coating is hard and 

abrasion resistant and is useful for reflectors, lamps 
and lenses.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a light transmissive article having a light-scattering
coating, its preparation and use. More particularly,
this invention relates to a light-scattering coating
comprising light-scattering particles dispersed in a
silica-containing, glassy binder, its preparation from
a silicone coating material and its use on various
articles, such as lamps.Electric lamps employing a filament or arc as the
source of light emit light in a pattern in which the
light source is visible, unless the emitted light is
broken up. Means commonly employed to break up a light
source image include a lenticuled lens (with or without
the use of a reflector), sandblasting the lamp
envelope, etching the lamp envelope or coating the lamp
envelope to scatter the emitted light and diffuse the
light source image of the arc or filament. Acid
etching or coating the lamp envelope is most commonly
found in a conventional household type of incandescent
lamp wherein the glass envelope enclosing the filament
is acid etched (frosted) and/or coated inside with a
particulate, light-diffusing powder. A mixture of clay
and silica has been used as a particulate, light-scattering
powder, because of its availability, light-scattering
properties, chemical inertness, low cost and
ability to withstand the high temperatures reached 
during lamp operation.High intensity incandescent lamps used for stage
and studio lighting employ a fused quartz filament or
arc chamber and are sometimes sand-blasted to break up
the emitted light source image so that the light
emitted by the lamp is more diffuse and the light
source is not visible on the object(s) being
illuminated. The fused quartz is able to withstand the
extremely high temperatures often exceeding 900Â°C
reached during lamp operation. However, sandblasting
can weaken the strength of the quartz and is a nuisance
to use in most manufacturing operations as it tends to
contaminate large areas of a plant with sand particles
and is noisy and dusty.US-A-5,035,745 describes a protective coating
for plastics comprising colloidal silica and/or cerium
oxide. The particle size is selected so as to minimise
scattering of visible light.The present invention relates to an article
having a light scattering coating as claimed in Claim 1,
to a process of forming a light-scattering coating on a substrate as
claimed in Claim 6, and to reflectors of electric lamps
having such coatings as claimed in Claims 8, 9 and 10.
By light-scattering
coating is meant a coating which is able to
scatter visible light
