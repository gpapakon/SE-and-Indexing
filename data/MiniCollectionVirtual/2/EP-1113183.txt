<ABSTRACT>
An electromagnetic clutch (10) for an air conditioning
compressor includes a generally cylindrical pulley (11)

rotatably mounted on a comressor housing (16) and having
an annular friction surface (21b), a driven member (12)

mounted on a compressor shaft (13)and having an annular
friction surface (21a) positioned radially adjacent the

first friction surface to form an annular space (21c)
therebetween. A quantity of flowable magnetic material

(27) is provided in the annular space (21c) and a magnetic
coil (34) is fixed on the housing adjacent thereto. A

control (40,46,46') connected to the magnetic coil (34)
supplies electrical power from a power supply (47) to

energize the magnetic coil and create magnetic flux in the
annular space (21c) polarizing the magnetic material and

frictionally coupling the first and second friction
surfaces (21a,21b) to cause the pulley (11) to rotate the

driven member (12). The control (40,46,46') can pulse
width modulate or ramp the supplied power for "soft"

starting and/or stopping of the compressor.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to the field of clutches for a
compressor in an air conditioning system. More
particularly, the invention pertains to such a clutch
having soft start characteristics.A compressor for an air conditioning system of an
automobile typically includes a clutch to enable
disengagement of the compressor during periods in which no
air conditioning is desired. During demand situations, the
clutch is engaged so that the compressor compresses the
refrigerant in a known manner. Prior art clutches
typically are of an electromagnetic friction clutch
construction. A compressor typically is driven by a V-groove
pulley assembly supported by a bearing pressed onto
the body of the compressor. The pulley is driven by the
automotive accessory drive belt.Prior art clutches typically include an armature affixed
to the splined shaft of the compressor via a bolt. A
stationary wire coil assembly is press-fit to the
compressor housing. The armature is normally separated by
a small air gap from the pulley face by a spring
mechanism, so that the clutch is normally disengaged. Automotive voltage is applied to the coil to engage the
clutch, normally having a nominal value of 14.4 volts.
Upon application of this voltage, the current in the coil
increases from zero on a time scale related to the
inductive time constant of the clutch, typically 150
milliseconds. The current induces magnetic flux to flow in
the pulley, across the air gap, and into the armature.
When the magnetic flux density reaches a critical level,
the attractive force between the armature and the pulley
becomes large enough to overcome the spring force holding
the armature away from the pulley. The armature is then
rapidly drawn into contact with the pulley, suddenly
initiating torque transfer to the compressor and causing
the compressor shaft to begin to rotate. When the shaft
speed matches the pulley speed, the torque then reaches a
steady-state level that is a function of pulley speed,
cooling demand, and other vehicle operational
characteristics.When such a prior art clutch is engaged, undesirable
effects can occur, including stumble and noise. Stumble is
a longitudinal vehicle vibration induced by the sudden
change in engine torque demand upon compressor engagement
and disengagement. Noise is generated as the armature of
the electromagnetic friction clutch is rapidly driven into
contact with the clutch pulley during engagement. These
effects of rapid compressor engagement are objectionalbe
to the vehicle occupants and may contribute to
