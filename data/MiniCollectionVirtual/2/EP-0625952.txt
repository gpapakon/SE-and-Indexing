<ABSTRACT>
A device for carrying an endless conveyor belt (1) along a helical part of its path comprises a frame (9, 10) supporting an outer ball track and an inner ball track, each arranged under a lateral portion (22, 23) of the conveyor belt along at least a section of the helical part of the conveyor belt path. Each ball track is formed of a plurality of ball-bearing elements (11) disposed helically after one another and each having a plurality of balls (21) in an endless ball track with an upper circular-arc-shaped track section (19) and a lower track section (20) which connects with the upper track section to form the endless ball track. The lateral portions (22, 23) of the conveyor belt (1) rest on the balls (21) in the upper track sections (19) of the ball-bearing elements (11).

<DESCRIPTION>
 DEVICE FOR CARRYING AN ENDLESS CONVEYOR BELT<ss. The present invention relates to a device for carry¬ ing an endless conveyor belt along a helical part of its 5 path, said device comprising a frame supporting an outer bearing track and an inner bearing track, each provided below a lateral portion of the conveyor belt along at least a section of the helical part of the belt conveyor. US-A-4,565,282 and US-A-4,899,871 disclose devices10 of this type. Here, use is made of two endless chains, each resting on balls in one of the bearing tracks, for carrying the conveyor belt.The object of the present invention is to improve the prior-art devices, especially with a view to facilitating15 maintenance and reducing the torque produced by the load take-up on the conveyor belt, when being of self-support¬ ing type.According to the invention, this object is achieved by a device of the above type, which is characterised in20 that at least the one bearing track is formed of a plura¬ lity of rolling-bearing units disposed helically after one another and each having a plurality of rolling elements in an endless rolling track having an upper circular-arc- shaped track section and a lower track section which con-25 nects with the upper track section to form the endless rolling track, and that at least one of the lateral por¬ tions of the conveyor belt rests on the rolling elements in the upper track sections of the corresponding rolling- bearing units.30 It is understood that if a rolling element, e.g. a* ball, in the device according to the invention becomes out-of-round or cracks, this is easily taken care of by* replacing the rolling-bearing unit containing this par¬ ticular rolling element. Neither does this have any35 effect on the performance of most of the rolling elements of the device. 

 The arrangement according to the invention also per¬ mits the use of rolling elements of relatively small dia¬ meter, which in turn enables load take-up producing less torque. As a result of the small diameter, it is also advantageous in terms of economy to use rolling elements of stainless steel, which reduces the risk of damage to the rolling elements.Finally, it is of great significance that the arrangement according to the invention makes it possible to dispense with either one or both chains.In one embodiment of the device according to the invention, at least one of the lateral portions of the conveyor belt can thus rest directly on the rolling ele¬ ments, the inner lateral portion of the conveyor belt suitably engaging a
