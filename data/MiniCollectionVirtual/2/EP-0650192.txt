<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a structure for coupling between a
low temperature circuitry and a room temperature circuitry, and
particularly to a joint structure for coupling between a low temperature
circuitry such as a superconducting circuit and a room temperature
circuitry.Devices which utilize superconducting phenomena operate rapidly
with low power consumption so that they have higher performance than
conventional semiconductor devices. Particularly, by using an oxide
superconducting material which has been recently advanced in study, it is
possible to produce a superconducting device which operates at relatively
high temperature, such as higher than a liquid nitrogen temperature.
Researches on Josephson junction devices, superconducting transistors,
superconducting field effect devices, etc. utilizing those oxide
superconductors are now in progress.On the other hand, it has been tried to utilize lower operating
temperature for semiconductor devices so as to improve their operating 
speeds and to be free from thermal noises. By this, the semiconductor
devices can operate with reduced current. Cooling system is also effective
to take stably away dissipated heat at each device, which is essential for
high degree of integration and rapid operation.Some extended researches have tried to use semiconductor devices
combined with superconducting devices at a liquid nitrogen temperature.Although the superconducting device utilizing the oxide
superconductor material (high Tc copper oxide superconductor) can
operate at an extremely higher temperature than that utilizing a metal
superconductor, cooling system is required to keep them at least liquid
nitrogen. Therefore, the operating temperature of the superconducting
device utilizing the oxide superconductor is lower around 200 Â°C or more
than the room temperature.In a prior art, the superconducting device and the cooled-down
semiconductor device are connected to a room temperature device by a
conventional method, such as bonding wires, bonding pads and
connectors, or in some cases using probing pins, etc. In this case,
although the superconducting device and the cooled-down semiconductor
device are maintained at a liquid nitrogen temperature, but the bonding
wires, connectors and probing pins are at higher temperature than that.
Therefore, the bonding wires, connectors and probing pins are inherently
subjected to large temperature gradient.The bonding wires and probing pins have small cross-sectional
areas so as to have large thermal resistance. This
