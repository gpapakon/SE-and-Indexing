<ABSTRACT>
A main housing part (GH) in an electrically screening design is used for accommodating electrically operated elements (LP1, LP2). A bushing opening (KO) for internal connecting cables (FB1, GS1; FB2, GS2) for supplying said elements can be closed, according to the invention, in an electrically screened manner by a plug island (TW, B, K) which is in the form of a trough. At least one interface plug (US1, US2) is incorporated in the circumferential side wall (TW) of the plug island. The internal connecting cable (FB1, GS1; FB2, GS2) can be connected to the inside of said plug, and an external connecting cable (K1, S1; K2, S2) can be connected to its outside, with the associated plug (S1, S2) in a horizontal position. As a result of the horizontal position of the plugs (S1, S2) which is made possible by the arrangement according to the invention, the plug island (TW, B, K) can be of flat design without any major increase in the depth of the main housing part (GH).

<CLAIMS>
Housing for receiving electrically driven 
elements, in particular printed-circuit boards (LP1, 

LP2), having 

a) a housing main part (GH), designed at least 
for electrical shielding, for receiving the 

electrically driven elements, which housing main part 
has at least one lead-out aperture (CI) for an internal 

connecting cable (FB1, GS1; FB2, GS2) for supplying the 
electrically driven elements, and having 
b) a trough-shaped plug island (TW, B, K, US1, 
US2), designed for electrical shielding, 


b1) which is formed so that the lead-out 
aperture (CI) can be closed off in an 

electrically shielded manner, and 
b2) which has at least one adaptor connector 
(US1, US2) embedded in the circumferential 

side wall (TW), wherein the internal 
connecting cable (FB1, GS1; FB2, GS2) can be 

connected to the inner side of the said 
adaptor connector, and an external connecting 

cable (K1; K2) having a cable connector (S1; 
S2) can be connected in a horizontal position 

to the outer side of the said adaptor 
connector. 
Housing according to claim 1, having a 
removable, tub-shaped covering body BW, which has a 

sealed bushing (KD) for an external connecting cable 
(K1; K2), there being at least one of these connecting 

cables, and which can be connected (DN) to the housing 
main part (GH) with total closure of the plug island 

(TW, B, K, US1, US2) against environmental influences. 
Housing according to claim 1 or 2, wherein 
the adaptor connector (US1, US2), of which there is at 

least one, has an EMV terminal lead connected to the 
body of the trough-shaped plug island (TW, B, K, US1,  

 
US2) for shielding an external connecting cable (K1, 

S1; K2, S2).
