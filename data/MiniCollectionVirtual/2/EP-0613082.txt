<ABSTRACT>
An adder (150) of four inputs and two outputs is a circuit for 
deriving CARRY and SUM satisfying in0 + in1 + in2 + in3 + cin = 2cout 

+ 2CARRY + SUM, where in0, in1, in2, in3 are the first to 
fourth inputs, cin is the intermediate carry from the preceding digit 

and cout is the intermediaty carry to the next digit. Cout is calculated 
only from (in0,in1,in2,in3) and will not be influenced by cin. 
The adder (150) is to be employed in an intermediate sum generating 
circuit (310,320,...,400) of a multiplier.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates generally to an
adder and a multiplier circuit employing the same.
More specifically, the invention relates to an adder
which generates an intermediate sum of the multiplier
circuit.Conventionally, a binary multiplier circuit
multiplying n-bit binary values, formed with an
integrated circuit, calculates logical multiplies
(AND's) of respective bits of a multiplied value and
multiplying value to generate n in number of n-bit
partial AND's (intermediate sums) and then calculates a
ground sum of the partial AND's to derive a product.
As a process for deriving the ground sum, a series of
full adders, in which adders of three inputs and two
outputs are connected in parallel, are employed to
reduce number of the partial AND's into 2/3 at
respective stages. Therefore, number of the partial
AND's is reduced in order of n → 2/3 n → 4/9 n ...
through a plurality of stages. When the number of the
partial AND's is reduced up to two, the ground sum is
calculated by means of a normal adder having two inputs
and one output. The multiplier circuit employing the 
process set forth above has been referred to as
Wallace type multiplier circuit. Here, the adder with
three inputs and two outputs is a circuit to perform
operation to output two outputs C, S satisfying
2C + S
= X + Y + Zwith respect to given three inputs X, Y and
Z.The conventional Wallace type multiplier
circuit for multiplying two n-bit values comprises a
partial AND's generating portion, an intermediate sum
generating portion, in which a plurality stages of full
adder series formed by connecting full adders in
parallel are provided in tree-like configuration, and
the adder of two inputs and one output.At first, by the partial AND's generating
portion n in number of n-bit partial AND's, X x Y1, X x
Y2, X x Y3, ..... X x Yn are calculated from a
multiplied value X and multiplying value Y (Y1, Y2, Y3,
... Yn).Then, at the first stage of the full adder
series, respective three partial AND's are input to
respectively corresponding full adders. Each
individual full adder receiving three input of the
partial AND's outputs two intermediate sum. Therefore,
through the first stage of the full adder series, the
intermediate sums of two-third in number of the initial
number of the partial AND's are output. In the similar
manner, number of the intermediate sums output from the 
first stage full adder series is reduced into two-third
through the second stage full adder series. Number of
stages of the intermediate sum calculating circuits
