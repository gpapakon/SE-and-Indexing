<ABSTRACT>
In a telecommunication network comprising a plurality of nodes (1, 2, 3, 
4, 5), these nodes are connected 
via
 a plurality of transmission channels (6, ..., 17). 
These transmission channels comprise a plurality of sub-channels. 
Splitting up a transmission channel into a number of sub-channels may be 
effected by means of time-division multiplexing, frequency-division multiplexing and 

space-division multiplexing. 
To reduce the complexity of the switching means (20) in the nodes, each 
sub-channel coming from a node is connected to each of the outgoing transmission 

channels. As a result, the number of switching elements is reduced by a factor equal to 
the number of outgoing transmission channels.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a telecommunication network comprising at least 
three nodes, at least one transmitting node being coupled to at least two other nodes via 
outgoing transmission channels which comprise a plurality of sub-channels, the 
transmitting node comprising switching means for selectively switching sub-signals 
carried by sub-channels of incoming transmission channels to coupling means, which 
coupling means are arranged for supplying the sub-signals switched through to the 
coupling means by the switching means to sub-channels of the outgoing transmission 
channels. The invention likewise relates to a node to be used in such a 
telecommunication network. A telecommunication network of this type is known from 
EP 429046 A2. Telecommunication networks as defined in the opening paragraph are 
used, for example, for transmitting higher-order trunk signals between telephone 
exchanges. The more the number of broadband services to users increase, the more the 
importance of trunk networks will be enhanced. Current trunk networks are usually 
arranged for a fixed transmission capacity between certain nodes, whilst 
reconfigurations of the network are to be carried out manually. This manual 
reconfiguration is very time-consuming, so that the network manager is incapable of 
reacting fast to a temporary shift of additionally required transmission capacity in 
certain areas of the telecommunication network. In future telecommunication networks new network elements such as, for 
example, cross-connects will be introduced by which it is possible to reconfigure the 
network under the control of a network management system in a very short period of 
time. The transmission channels are often used in multiplexed mode, so that the 
transmission channel is subdivided into a number of sub-channels. This subdivision of a 
transmission channel may be effected, for example, by frequency-division multiplexing 
(wavelength-division multiplexing), time-division multiplexing or space-division  
 
multiplexing. If it is assumed that each transmission channel comprises N sub-channels 
and M incoming and M outgoing transmission channels are connected to the node, 
N².M² switching elements are necessary for applying each sub-signal in a sub-channel 
to an arbitrary sub-channel of another transmission channel. In the telecommunication 
network known from said Patent application the switching means comprise optical 
switch elements and wavelength-division multiplexing is used for subdividing the 
transmission
