<ABSTRACT>
Improvement to drive devices called "contra-angles", for rotary tools used in bone surgery, especially in dental surgery. In a device for driving tools used in bone surgery, especially in dental surgery, the liquid feed tube (7) is surrounded, between the location of the upper part (13) of the tool (6) and an end stop (18) which is solidly fixed to the feed tube (7), at least when a tool (6) is locked onto the apparatus, by a sealing pipe (19) made of elastic material, whose length is such that, when a tool (6) is in place, this pipe (19) is slightly compressed between the abovementioned end stop (18) and the inlet orifice (8) of the tool (6), and a sealing sleeve (20), made of elastic material, is fitted to the casing (1) of the apparatus so as to be compressed between the casing (1) and the shoulder (15) of the tool (6) which is in place.
