<ABSTRACT>
One of the faces of a metal strip forming a cathode runs past continuously at a specified speed in an electrolyte in front of the anodes (741 to 74N; 751 to 75N) which are powered by controllable rectifiers (R1 to RN) respectively. The strip is divided into length and width increments and predetermined coating ratios. A total current is determined beforehand to ensure the coatings of the increments. The control process then includes the determination of a number of rectifiers to be set in operation, the determination of an estimated current for each rectifier by dividing the total current equally among the said rectifiers to be set in operation, and the determination of current set points to be applied to the rectifiers to be set in operation. The process is cyclic for each of the faces of the strip (1).

Method of regulating electrolytic deposition 
of a metal coating onto one of the sides of a metal 

strip, said metal strip forming a cathode and being 
fed continuously at a set feed rate (VACTU) in an 

electrolyte past anodes (71

the anodes being respectively supplied by 

controllable rectifiers (R

) having respective 
upper and lower current limits (IBUTEE(1) to 

IBUTEE(N) ; IDENS), the strip being divided into 
increments having a fixed length, each increment 

having a predetermined width and a predetermined 
coating rate (LARGEUR(n), R(n)), the method starting 

with the determination (E42) of a total current 
(ITOTAL) required to ensure the coatings of the 

increments between the anodes as a function of said 
coating rates, widths and feed rate,
 
   characterized by 


determining (E41) a number (NBR) of rectifiers 
to be put into operation as a function of the 

required total current (ITOTAL) and of the lower 
current limits (IDENS, IDENSMIN) of the rectifiers, 
determining (E52 to E76) a predicted current 
(IPREV(1) to IPREV(N)) for each rectifier by 

distributing the required total current (ITOTAL) 
equally between said rectifiers to be put into 

operation between said respective upper and lower 
current limits, and 
determining (E80 to E87) current values (IREF(1) 
to IREF(N)) to be applied to the rectifiers to be put 

into operation, a current value for a given rectifier
