<ABSTRACT>
A screw compressor employs a piston unloader which is disposed in a bore remote from the compressor's working chamber. Flow communication between the bore and working chamber is through a series of non-overlapping unloader ports. The unloader piston has a notched end face which effectively causes the unloader ports to overlap in operation. Precise and continuous capacity control of the compressor over a predetermined portion of its operating range is thereby achieved while internal high to low side gas leakage within the compressor and the clearance volume of the unloader ports is minimized. Compressor efficiency is thereby increased.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to screw compressors.Screw compressor piston unloading arrangements of
the type illustrated in U.S. Patents 4,042,310; 4,544,333;
4,565,508; and US 5203685 (which is assigned to the applicant)
employ an axially movable or rotatable
unloading piston disposed within a cylindrical bore remote from
the compressor's working chamber. The bore communicates with
the working chamber through a series of axially arranged
unloader ports and is additionally in flow communication with a
portion of the compressor which is at compressor suction
pressure in operation. When the unloading piston in such arrangements is
positioned within the unloader bore so as to completely
interrupt communication of the bore with the compressor's
working chamber through the unloader ports the compressor
operates fully loaded because the compression pockets defined
in the working chamber are prevented from unloading to suction
through the unloader ports and bore. The unloading piston is
moved axially or is rotated within the bore to fully or
partially cover or uncover the unloader ports in a sequential
manner thereby providing for the selective and variable
communication of the compression pockets within the working
chamber back to suction for the purpose of unloading the
compressor.Figures 1, 2 and 3
herein are, respectively, Figures 1, 5 and 6 of US5203685.
Figure 1 is a partial
cross-sectional side view of a screw compressor illustrating
piston unloader apparatus associated with the male rotor of a
screw compressor with the unloader piston in the full unload
position. Compressor 10 is comprised of a rotor housing 12 and
bearing housing 14. A motor 16, male rotor 18 and female rotor
(not shown) are disposed in the rotor housing. Shaft 22
extends from the male rotor and motor rotor 24 is mounted
thereon.Suction gas enters rotor housing 12 through the
suction end 26 of the compressor and passes through a suction
strainer (not shown) prior to passing through and around motor
16 in a manner which cools the motor. In this regard, suction
gas passing through and around motor 16 passes out of motor-rotor 
housing gap 28, rotor-stator gap 30 and into suction area
32 within the rotor housing. The gas next passes from suction
area 32, through suction port 34 and into the working chamber
36 where it is enveloped in a chevron shaped compression pocket
defined by the wall of the working chamber and the intermeshed
lobes of male rotor 18 and the female rotor.As the male and female rotors rotate, the pocket in
which the

<CLAIMS>
A screw compressor comprising a housing (12)
defining a working chamber (36), a bore (50) remote

from said working chamber, a plurality of ports (52a)
communicating between said working chamber and bore,

said ports being spaced apart so that no portion of
any one of them overlaps an adjacent port along said

bore, and unloading means (54a) moveable in said bore
for unloading said compressor by varying the extent of

an unloading path from said working chamber to said
bore through said ports, characterised in that said

unloading means (54a) comprises means (108) for
providing a flow path between adjacent ones of said

ports (52a) within said bore according to the axial
position of said unloading means within said bore

such that the extent of said unloading path is
continuously variable by axial movement of said

unloading means along said bore whereby the load
condition of said compressor is continuously variable

over at least a predetermined portion of the operating
range thereof. 
A compressor according to claim 1, wherein said
unloading means comprises a piston (54a) axially

slideable in said bore between a full unload position
and a full load position, said piston defining a notch

for providing said flow path between adjacent ones of

said ports according to the axial position of said
piston in said bore.
A compressor according to claim 2, wherein a
first portion of said piston (54a) is located in said

bore (50) irrespective of the axial position of said
piston in said bore, said first portion defining said

notch (108).
A compressor according to claim 2 or 3, wherein
said notch (108) is aligned within said bore (50) for

communication with said ports (52a).
A compressor according to claim 2, 3 or 4,
wherein said piston (54a) is configured such that at

least a portion of said notch (108) is in
communication with at least one of said ports (52a)

other than when said piston is in said full load and
said full unload positions.
A compressor according to any one of claims 2 to 
5, further comprising means (102) for preventing

rotation of said piston.
A compressor according to any one of claims 2 to
6, wherein said piston includes an uninterrupted

circumferential seal portion disposed within said bore

A compressor according to any one of claims 2 to
7, wherein in said full load position, flow from said

working chamber to said bore through said ports is
prevented by said piston.
A compressor according to any one of claims 2 to
8, wherein said notch is placed in communication with

at least one of said ports immediately subsequent to
axial movement of said piston out of said full load

position.
A compressor according to any one of claims 2 to
