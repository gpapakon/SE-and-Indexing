<ABSTRACT>
A system of Flash EEprom memory chips with controlling 
circuits serves as non-volatile memory such as that provided by 

magnetic disk drives. Improvements include the ability to remap 
and replace defective cells with substitute cells. The remapping 

is performed automatically as soon as a defective cell is detected. 
When the number of defects in a Flash sector becomes large, the 

whole sector is remapped.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates generally to
semiconductor electrically erasable programmable read
only memories (EEprom), and specifically to a system of
integrated circuit Flash EEprom chips.Computer systems typically use magnetic disk
drives for mass storage of data. However, disk drives
are disadvantageous in that they are bulky and in their
requirement for high precision moving mechanical parts.
Consequently they are not rugged and are prone to
reliability problems, as well as consuming significant
amounts of power. Solid state memory devices such as
DRAM's and SRAM's do not suffer from these
disadvantages. However, they are much more expensive,
and require constant power to maintain their memory
(volatile). Consequently, they are typically used as
temporary storage.EEprom's and Flash EEprom's are also solid
state memory devices. Moreover, they are nonvolatile,
and retain their memory even after power is shut down.
However, conventional Flash EEprom's have a limited
lifetime in terms of the number of write (or
program)/erase cycles they can endure. Typically the
devices are rendered unreliable after 102 to 103
write/erase cycles. Traditionally, they are typically
used in applications where semi-permanent storage of
data or program is required but with a limited need for
reprogramming. Accordingly, it is an object of the present
invention to provide a Flash EEprom memory system with
enhanced performance and which remains reliable after
enduring a large number of write/erase cycles.It is another object of the present invention
to provide an improved Flash EEprom system which can
serve as non-volatile memory in a computer system.It is another object of the present invention
to provide an improved Flash EEprom system that can
replace magnetic disk storage devices in computer
systems.It is another object of the present invention
to provide a Flash EEprom system with improved erase
operation.It is another object of the present invention
to provide a Flash EEprom system with improved error
correction.It is yet another object of the present
invention to provide a Flash EEprom with improved write
operation that minimizes stress to the Flash EEprom
device.It is still another object of the present
invention to provide a Flash EEprom system with enhanced
write operation. Prior art documents include GB-A-2 136 992, Computer
Design, vol. 28, nÂ° 5, March 1989, pages 30-32, and US-A-4493 075.In general according to the prior art there is shown for
example a memory used in various environments which is effective to
correct

<CLAIMS>
A fault-tolerant memory system (31, 33) including an
array of Flash EEPROM cells (33) and means for managing defects

(31, 33) therein, comprising:

a plurality of Flash erasable sectors (211, 213, 401)
partitioned from said array such that all cells within each

sector are erasable together;
redundant (407) cells within said array for substituting one
or more defective cells;
a memory controller (31) coupled to the array for
controlling memory operations of the array;
error detection means (31) operated with said memory
controller during use of the memory for detecting one or more

defective cells within a given sector (401);
a defect map (409) maintained by said memory controller
during use of the memory and stored within the array (33) for

storing addresses of said detected one or more defective cells; and,
defective cell substituting means (31) for substituting said
one or more defective cells within a given sector with a

corresponding number of redundant cells;
reading means (31) for reading the state of addressed storage
cells;
programming means (31) for programming addressed storage
cells to a predetermined state;
a cache memory (705);

and wherein said programming means includes means for
initially programming said cache memory rather than said EEPROM

(33), 
said reading means including, means for initially determining
whether the cache memory contains data to be read, and said

programming means additionally includes means responsive to said
cache memory becoming full for writing its oldest unused block of

data into said EEPROM, thereby to make room for new data in said
cache memory.
A fault-tolerant memory system as in claim 1,
wherein said redundant cells are in the same sector as the

defective cells when the defective cells in the sector do not
exceed a predetermined number, and said redundant cells are in

a different sector when said predetermined number is exceeded.
A fault-tolerant memory system as in claim 2, wherein
said sector is replaced in its entirety by a redundant sector

when said number is exceeded.
A fault-tolerant memory system as in claim 2, wherein
said system for correcting errors applies whenever a defective

cell arises during operations of the array.
A fault-tolerant memory system as in claim 4, further

comprising error correction codes for detecting and correcting
errors from defective cells.
A fault-tolerant memory system as in claim 4, wherein:

each sector has redundant cells therein for substituting
defective cells that arise in said each sector; and
said each sector is being substituted by another sector when
the defective cells in said each sector exceed a predetermined

number.
