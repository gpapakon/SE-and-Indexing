<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to paste
formulations for use in the electronics industry and,
in particular, to solder paste or cream formulations
in which an emulsion of two or more immiscible
organic liquids is used as a vehicle for a suitable
solder powder.Vehicles which are commonly used in the
preparation of solder creams or pastes for the
electronics industry may contain a volatile solvent,
a thickener/binder, a rheological modifier to enhance
thixotropy or pseudoplasticity, a surfactant and
usually an activating agent which may be an amine or
amine hydrohalide, an organic acid(s) or similarly
suitable reducing or chelating agents. The level of
organic solids to provide the necessary rheology to
support solder powder and to enable screen or stencil
printing is normally about 40wt% up to 80wt% based on
the weight of the vehicle which comprises between
7wt% and 15wt% of the solder paste formulation. The
materials used are either polymeric, such as ethyl
cellulose or derivatives thereof, polyamides or
castor oil derivatives which provide relevent
rheological characteristics for electronics use, for
example screen or stencil printing. Rosin and
derivatives thereof may be used in the vehicle in the
range 20wt% to 80wt%.In microelectronic processing several
difficulties are found with present day solder paste
systems. The high level and the nature of the
organic solids used to provide the required rheology
often leads to a high temperature coefficient of
viscosity for the flux and solder paste. Minor
increases in temperature therefore can lead to a 
severe drop in viscosity which may lead to
deterioration in printing and poor slump
characteristics. In the automated manufacture and
electrical testing of printed circuit boards (pcb's),
large levels of organic residues typically 4.5wt% to
7.5wt% on the solder paste, can interfere with
automatic electrical probe testing of a board and so
complex and expensive cleaning operations need to be
carried out to remove these residues.Because of the disadvantages highlighted above,
we have found a way of making a vehicle, for which we
can tailor the rheology, which when formulated as a
solder paste or cream and reflowed yields low organic
residues, typically less than 2.5wt% based on a
solder paste or cream containing at least 90% by
weight of solder powder, when reflowed at a
temperature in the range of up to 270°, preferably
less than 1.6wt%. At such low residual solids
content there is minimal interference wit the
automatic electrical probe testing of soldered
