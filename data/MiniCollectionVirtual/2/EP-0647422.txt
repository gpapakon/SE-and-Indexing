<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a curtain glider (1) for hanging up and taking down a curtain (2) on and from a running rail (3). This curtain glider (1) has a gliding carriage (5) with, in the gliding direction, push-in projection (11) on one side and push-in recess (12) on the other side, so that the push-in projection (11) engages in the push-in recess (12) of a neighbouring curtain glider (1) when the curtain gliders (1) are pushed together. As a result, a stabilization of the curtain gliders (1) in the course of various movement sequences is achieved. In addition, the gliding carriage (5) has a centring frame (13) which bridges the gliding head (4) and possesses a centring recess (14) for the gliding head (4) pressed against it, the gliding head thereby always being aligned orthogonally to the guiding slot of the running rail (3), and consequently a detachment of the curtain glider (1) from the running rail (3) by itself being prevented.

Curtain glider (1) for the hanging and removal of a 
curtain (2) from a runner rail (3), 


with a T-shaped sliding head (4) sliding in the runner 
rail (3) and with a sliding carriage (5) movable beneath the 

runner rail (3), 
the T-shaped sliding head (4) is mounted in the sliding 
carriage (5) so as to be rotatable ab
out at least 90° against 
the action of a restoring spring (6), 
the T-shaped sliding head (4) has a laterally 
projecting control cam (7), 
the sliding carriage (5) has guide flanges (8) 
projecting on both sides and on the underside has a hanging 

bracket (9) for the curtain (2), 
 
characterised in that the sliding carriage (5) has in the 

sliding direction at its one carriage end an insertion pin 
(11) and at its other carriage end an insertion recess (12) 

to receive the insertion pin (11) of an adjacent sliding 
carriage when curtain gliders (1) are pushed together and 

that the hanging bracket (9) is constructed as a downwardly 
V-shaped bracket for extending the curtain (2), hung with in 

each case two loops arranged with the given spacing on the 
hanging brackets (9), with curtain gliders (1) pulled apart. 
Curtain glider according to Claim 1, characterised in 
that the insertion pin (11) is constructed as a multiple 

finger pin with an introduction wedge (17) and if necessary 
with a marginal member (18) and the insertion recess (12) is 

constructed as a multiple finger mounting with if necessary 
a detent recess for the engageable and disengageable detent  

 
member (18). 
Curtain glider according to Claim 1 or 2, characterised 
in that the sliding carriage (5) has a centering bracket 

(13) bridging in sliding direction the T-shaped sliding head 
(4) sliding in the running rail (3), that the sliding head 

(4) in the region of its control cam (7) has a rotary stop 
(19), e.g. a stop cam, which engages into a stop recess 

(20), a stop slit, on the centering bracket (13), and that 
the axially movable sliding head (4) can be pressed down 

with the rotary stop (19) against the action of a spring 
from the stop position. 
Curtain glider according to one of Claims 1 to 3, 
characterised in that the rotary stop (19) is arranged on 

the control cam (7). 
Curtain glider according to Claim 1 or 2, characterised 
in that the sliding carriage (5) has a centering bracket 

(13) bridging in sliding direction the T-shaped sliding head 
(4) sliding in the running rail (3), and the centering 

bracket (13) has on its underside a centering recess (14), 
running transversely to the sliding direction, for the 

sliding head (4) aligned in the running rail transversely to 
the sliding direction and also axially movable and pressed 

against as a result of spring action, or for its T-arm. 
Curtain glider according to one of Claims 1 to 5, 
characterised in that the sliding carriage (5) has a bore 

(15) for a hollow pin (16), insertable therein, to receive 
the restoring spring (6), and the T-shaped sliding head (4) 

is guided with its T-bar with intercalation of the restoring 
spring (6) beneath the control cam (7) in the bore (15) and 

if necessary so as to be axially movable in the hollow pin 
(16). 
Curtain glider according to one of Claims 1 to 6,  
 

characterised in that the hollow pin (16) is constructed as 
a centering sleeve for the restoring spring (6) and the T-shaped 

sliding head (4) or a centering sleeve (21) is 
inserted into the hollow pin (16). 
Curtain glider according to one of Claims 1 to 7, 
characterised in that the guide flanges (8), projecting on 

both sides, for the sliding carriage (5) are formed onto the 
centering bracket (13). 
Curtain glider according to one of Claims 1 to 8, 
characterised in that the restoring spring (6) for the T-shaped 

sliding head (4) is constructed as a spring which is 
adjustable with regard to its torsional force and 

compressive force. 
Curtain glider according to one of Claims 1 to 9, 
characterised in that the hanging bracket (9) is arranged in 

oblique position to the sliding direction on the underside 
of the sliding carriage (5) and thereby an overlapping of 

the hanging brackets (9) of adjacent and pushed-together 
curtain gliders (1) can be achieved. 
Curtain glider according to one of Claims 1 to 10, 
characterised in that the hanging bracket (9) has a 

flattened angle of inclination (α) in the region of the 
upper ends of its V-shanks. 
Curtain glider according to one of Claims 1 to 11, 
characterised in that the hanging bracket (9), consisting of 

plastic, can be engaged with its one bracket end (22) into 
the sliding carriage (5). 
Curtain glider according to one of Claims 1 to 12, 
characterised in that the restoring spring (6) consists of 

steel and the curtain glider (1) further consists of 
plastic.  

 
Curtain glider according to one of Claims 1 to 13, 
characterised in that it has a magnet plug for an end stop 

constructed as a terminal magnet.
