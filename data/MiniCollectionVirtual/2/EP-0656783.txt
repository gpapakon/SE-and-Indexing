<ABSTRACT>
A pharmaceutical known by the trademark ONCONASE, as described in PCT patent applications WO 89/09606 and WO 91/07435 is combined with drugs sold under the names Cisplatin, Melphalan and Adriamycin. The combinations of ONCONASE with these drugs has unexpected bioactivity (in vitro) against OVCAR-3 human ovarian adenocarcinoma cells.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to pharmaceuticals, and more 
particularly relates to pharmaceuticals for use in 
treating cells which cause cancer tumors in humans. PCT patent applications WO 89/09606 and WO 91/07435 
disclose a pharmaceutical which will be referred to 
herein by the trademark ONCONASE. It has now been 
determined that when this pharmaceutical is used in vitro 
in a combined therapy with three other drugs, the results 
of the combined therapy are, in certain instances, much 
more bioactive than would be expected. These other drugs are known as Cisplatin, Melphalan 
and Adriamycin. In vitro data indicate that a combination of 
ONCONASE with a drug sold under the name Cisplatin is 
much more bioactive against human ovarian OVCAR-3 
adenocarcinoma than would be expected, given the separate 
activities of ONCONASE and Cisplatin. In vitro also data 
indicate that a combination of ONCONASE with a drug sold 
under the name Melphalan is much more bioactive against 
human ovarian OVCAR-3 adenocarcinoma than would be 
expected, given the separate activities of ONCONASE and 
Melphalan. In vitro data indicate that a combination of 
ONCONASE with a drug sold under the name Adriamycin is 
much more bioactive against human ovarian OVCAR-3 
adenocarcinoma than would be expected, given the separate 
activities of ONCONASE and Adriamycin. The preferred embodiment of the invention was tested 
using a cell culture assay. In such an assay, a cell 
line of known growth rate over a predetermined period is 
treated with the substance under test and the growth of 
the treated cells is compared with the growth which would 
ordinarily be expected from untreated cells. ONCONASE, described in the above-referenced patent 
applications and manufactured in accordance with the  
 
methodology described in PCT patent application 
WO 89/09606 
was 
dissolved in phosphate buffered saline (PBS) to obtain 
1mg/ml stock solution. Cisplatin, also known as cis-diamminedichloroplatinum, 
is a heavy metal complex 
containing a central atom of platinum surrounded by two 
chloride atoms and two ammonia molecules in the cis 
position. It has the molecular formula Pt Cl2H6N2 and a 
molecular weight of 300.1. Melphalan, also known as L-phenylalanine mustard, 
phenylalanine mustard, L-PAM, or L-sarcolysin, is 
4-[bis(2-chloroethyl)amino]-L-phenylalanine. Adriamycin is a trademark for Doxorubicin HCl, USP. 
Doxorubicin is an anthracycline antibiotic isolated from 
cultures of Streptomyces peucetius var. caesius. 
Doxorubicin consists of a
