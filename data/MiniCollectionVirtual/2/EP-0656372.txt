<ABSTRACT>
A novel process for producing an acrylic polymer serving as a sludge dehydrating agent, which polymer 
contains tertiary amino group which are neither quaternized nor conve
rted into corresponding salts and has a high 
molecular weight, which process comprises preparing an acrylic monomer containing a tertiary ammonium carbonate 

group by the reaction of an aqueous solution of an acrylic monomer containing a tertiary amino group with carbon 
dioxide, polymerizing the obtained monomer alone or copolymerizing the monomer with another copolymerizable 

vinyl monomer to prepare a polymer containing tertiary ammonium carbonate units, and decarbonating the polymer 
by heating and/or evacuating. Among others, especially an acrylic polymer containing at least 5 mol% of the tertiary 

amino group units and comprising a water-soluble vinyl polymer having the intrinsic viscosity [η] of 1 dl/g or above 

is useful as an excellent sludge dehydrating agent.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a novel process 
for preparing an acrylic polymer having a free tertiary 
amino group which is not quaternized or not salt formed 
and having a high molecular weight, which has been 
conventionally difficult to be prepared, and a dewatering 
agent for sludge using the same. Generally, a dewatering agent for sludge, which 
shows excellent flocculating ability and dewatering 
ability in a small amount and which is able to be burned 
up, has been widely used as a flocculant and a dewatering 
auxiliant against sewage sludge, industrial drainage 
sludge, and the like. When an acrylic monomer containing a tertiary 
amino group is polymerized as it is, since its 
polymerization does not proceed and a molecular weight 
does not increase, generally, polymerization has been 
carried out after the tertiary amino group is quaternized 
with an alkyl halide and the like or the acrylic monomer 
is salt formed with a mineral acid and the like. For instance, as a dewatering agent for sludge, 
a water-soluble vinyl polymer having a quaternary ammonium 
group or a tertiary ammonium salt neutralized with a 
mineral acid and the like has been used. For instance, 
polymers having an ammonium group quaternized with an 
alkyl halide such as methyl chloride or ethyl chloride, 
dimethyl sulfate, diethyl sulfate, and the like are 
described in Japanese Examined Patent Publication No.

ammonium group quaternized with benzyl chloride is 
described in Japanese Unexamined Patent Publication No. 
51899/1982 and the like. Also, in Japanese Examined 
Patent Publication No. 52040/1990, Japanese Examined

prepared by polymerizing monomers which have been 
previously salt formed by using a mineral acid such as 
hydrochloric acid, sulfuric acid or phosphoric acid, or 
acetic acid are described. However, because the effects 
of water-soluble vinyl polymers having a quaternary 
ammonium group or an ammonium group neutralized with a 
mineral acid and the like are not sufficient for sludge 
having a difficulty to
