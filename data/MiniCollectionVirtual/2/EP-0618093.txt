<ABSTRACT>
The coupling bolt 5 of the proposed trailer bolt coupling is moved upwards into its release position by actuating a hand-operated hydraulic pump 35. For this purpose, it has a blind hole which serves as a hydraulic cylinder space 15 and into which a rigidly attached piston rod 19 with piston 17 projects, the actuation pressure of the hydraulic fluid being introduced into the rod space of the hydraulic cylinder through a hole 21 which extends in the piston rod and opens above the piston. A release valve 55 which is triggered by the drawbar rod of a trailer when it is being hitched allows the hydraulic fluid to flow off again so that the coupling bolt moves back down again to its coupled position under the effect of a coupling spring 25.

Trailer bolt coupling having a coupling bolt 
(5) which can be shifted in an upwardly extending 

direction in the coupling body (3) and is acted upon by 
a coupling spring (25) in the direction of the 

downwards movement into its coupling position and can 
be shifted upwards into its release position under the 

action of the pressure of a working medium,
 
characterised in that the upward-shifting mechanism is 

a hydraulic cylinder, the cylinder space (15) of which 
is formed by a blind bore in the coupling bolt (5) and 

the piston (17) of which is fastened to a suspended, 
rigidly fastened piston rod (19), with the pressure 

loading taking place by way of a bore (21) which 
extends in the piston rod (19), above the piston (17), 

and opens out into the rod space of the hydraulic 
cylinder space (15). 
Trailer bolt coupling according to claim 1, 
characterised by at least one safety bar (27) which 

secures the coupling bolt (5) in the coupling position 
and is spring-loaded in the direction of its locking 

position and can be hydraulically actuated in the 
direction of the unlocking position, with the pressure-loading 

space of said safety bar being connected to 
that of the coupling bolt (5). 
Trailer bolt coupling according to claim 1 or 
2, characterised by a hand pump (35) for producing the 

pressure load. 
Trailer bolt coupling according to claim 3, 
characterised in that the pump lever (43) is mounted on 

the side of the coupling housing (13) and by way of a 
two-arm actuating cam (41) acts in an alternating 

manner on two pump pistons (37) in the direction of the 
discharge of hydraulic fluid, with the sucking back of 

the hydraulic fluid taking place by means of springs 
(39) which reset the pump pistons (37).  

 
Trailer bolt coupling according to one or more 
of the preceding claims, characterised in that the 

cylinder space (15) in the coupling bolt (5) beneath 
the piston (17) is filled with a prestressed gas, which 

supports or replaces the spring action which presses 
the coupling bolt downwards into the coupling position. 
Trailer bolt coupling according to one or more 
of the preceding claims, characterised by a release 

valve (55), which when actuated releases for the return 
flow the path of the pressure fluid which acts upon the 

hydraulic cylinder (15). 
Trailer bolt coupling according to claim 6, 
characterised in that for actuation, the release valve 

(55) is set by the tow bar eye (9) of the trailer tow 
bar (7), which tow bar eye enters into the coupling 

body (3). 
Trailer bolt coupling according to claim 6 
and/or 7, characterised in that the release valve (55) 

has a locking piston (65), which is held in its locking 
position by the actuating pressure and in which locking 

piston a spring-loaded relief ball (73) locks in the 
same direction, with the mechanical disengaging 

movement being transferred by way of a push rod (81), 
first of all to the relief ball (73) and then to the 

locking piston (65). 
Trailer bolt coupling according to claim 7 
and/or 8, characterised by a pressing claw (89) of a 

clearance-eliminating device, which pressing claw 
presses the tow bar eye (9) against the coupling bolt 

(5) in order to eliminate clearance during operation, 
with the pressing claw (89) being operatively connected 

to the release valve (55). 
Trailer-coupling bolt according to claim 9, 
characterised by a finger (90) which protrudes from the 

pressing claw (89) for producing the operative 
connection.  

 
Trailer bolt coupling according to claim 9 
and/or 10, characterised in that during operation the 

pressing claw (89) is acted upon by the fluid pressure 
in a high-pressure space (93), and in that this high-pressure 

space (93) is connected by way of a duct, 
which is controlled by a relief valve (109), to a low-pressure 

space (103), with it being possible to trigger 
the relief valve (109) by means of the working-medium 

pressure which acts upon the coupling bolt (5). 
Trailer bolt coupling according to claim 11, 
characterised in that the pressure in the high-pressure 

space (93) builds up during operation by sucking back 
from the low-pressure space (103) by way of a suck-back 

return-flow valve (97).
