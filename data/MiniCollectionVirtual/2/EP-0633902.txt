Biodegradable, water-resistant polymer material in the form 
of foils, films, strips, masses, molded articles or the 

like, produced in a process comprising the steps: 

a) at least partially derivatizing polysaccharides and/or 
polypeptides at their hydroxyl, amino, imino, thiol 

and/or carboxyl groups in a non-radical reaction with an 
agent including cross-linkable groups to form an 

uncrosslinked reaction product and 
b) converting the uncrosslinked reaction product from step 
a) to form a product of cross-linking reaction by 

cross-linking the cross-linkable groups. 
Polymer material as defined in claim 1, characterized in 
that the cross-linkable groups include acrylic and/or 

methacrylic residues. 
Polymer material as defined in claim 2, characterized in 
that the agents include glycidyl acrylate and/or glycidyl 

methacrylate. 
Polymer material as defined in any of claims 1 to 3, 
characterized in that the polypeptides are of collagenic 

origin, in particular gelatin, animal glues, collagen or  
 

collagen hydrolysate and/or whey proteins, caseins, 
vegetable proteins, in particular soybean proteins. 
Polymer material as defined in any of claims 1 to 4, 
characterized in that on average at least 10 cross-linkable 

groups are present per 1000 monosaccharides or amino acids 
of the polysaccharide or polypeptide chains. 
Polymer material as defined in any of claims 1 to 5, 
characterized in that the cross-linkable groups of the 

polypeptide portion are linked to the peptide chain 
essentially exclusively via amino and carboxyl groups. 
Polymer material as defined in any of claims 1 to 5, 
characterized in that the cross-linkable groups of the 

polypeptide portion are linked to the polypeptide chain 
essentially exclusively via carboxyl groups. 
Polymer material as defined in any of claims 1 to 7, 
characterized in that on average up to 150 cross-linkable 

groups are present per 1000 amino acids of the polypeptide 
chain. 
Polymer material as defined in any of claims 1 to 8, 
characterized in that the polysaccharide portions are 

cross-linked with the polypeptide portions. 
Polymer material as defined in any of claims 1 to 9, 
characterized in that the cross-linking reaction is 

continued until the product of cross-linking reaction 
becomes water-insoluble.  

 
Polymer material as defined in any of claims 1 to 10, 
characterized in that the product of cross-linking reaction 

is swellable in water. 
Polymer material as defined in any of claims 1 to 11, 
characterized in that it is obtained in a cross-linking 

reaction in the presence of a free monomer and/or prepolymer 
of the agents. 
Polymer material as defined in any of claims 1 to 12, 
characterized in that the cross-linking reaction is a 

reaction of polymerization, of polycondensation or 
polyaddition. 
Polymer material as defined in any of claims 1 to 13, 
characterized in that the functional groups of the 

polysaccharides and/or polypeptides are partly blocked by 
protective groups prior to the derivatization. 
Polymer material as defined in any of claims 1 to 14, 
characterized in that such derivatization products including 

different cross-linking groups, if necessary in the same 
molecular chain, accessible to different cross-linking 

reaction types are partially used as derivatized 
polysaccharides and/or polypeptides.
