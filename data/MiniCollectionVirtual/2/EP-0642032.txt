<ABSTRACT>
Provided is a sound source determining system 
which can accurately and economically identify the 

position of aircraft in an airport or the like. The 
direction of a sound source is determined by arranging 

a plurality of acoustic sensors (S0, S1, S2, S3, .... 
S-1, S-2, S-3, ...) in an array at a prescribed 

interval for detecting an acoustic signal produced from 
the sound source, connecting a plurality of delay 

circuits (D0, D1, D2, D3, ..., D-1, D-2, D-3, ...) 
having delay times which are different from one to a 

next by a unit time period (τ) to the outputs of the 
acoustic sensors, adding up the outputs of the delay 

circuits in an adder circuit (AD), and determining the 
direction of the sound source according to the unit 

time period (τ) which will maximize the output of the 
adder circuit.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a sound source 
determining system, and in particular to a sound source 
determining system suitable for use in airports or the 
like for determining the locations of aircraft or the 
like. Normally, various taxiways are laid in an airport 
for permitting aircraft to taxi from one place to 
another, and it is essential to determine where in 
these taxiways each aircraft is currently located. By accurately determining the location of each 
aircraft in the taxiways, the aircraft on the taxiways 
can be effectively guided, and collision of the 
aircraft on the taxiways can be avoided. As methods for determining the locations of 
aircraft in an airport or the like, there are known 
(1) the method of visually determining the locations of 
aircraft by a number of personnel monitoring the 
aircraft either directly with their own eyes or by 
using ITVs; and (2) the method of determining the locations of aircraft 
according to the outputs of sensors placed along the 
taxiways. However, since an airport typically consists of a 
vast area and each of the taxiways extends a 
substantial distance, a large number of personnel are 
required for visually monitoring aircraft either 
directly with their own eyes or by using ITVs, and the 
need for human intervention does not allow total 
elimination of the possibility of accidents due to 
human errors. When a number of sensors are to be arranged along 
taxiways, the number of the sensors must be adequate  
 
and they must be wisely arranged in proper locations 
for them to be effective in accurately determining the 
positions of aircraft. However, there is a limit to 
the locations where such sensors can be installed, and 
the cost will be prohibitively high when a large number 
of sensors are to be placed in a large number of 
locations. In view of such problems, a primary object of the 
present invention is to provide a sound source 
determining system which can accurately and 
economically identify the positions of aircraft or the 
like in airports or the like. To achieve such an object, the present invention 
provides a sound source determining system, comprising: 
a plurality of acoustic sensors arranged in an array at 
a prescribed interval for detecting an acoustic signal 
produced from a sound source; a plurality of delay 
circuits connected to outputs of the acoustic sensors 
and having delay times which are different from one to 
a next by a unit time period; an adder circuit for 
adding up outputs of the delay circuits; and
