<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to semi-solid to solid, 
normally liquid vegetable oil compositions and the use 
thereof, particularly in the food industry. Vegetable oils are most desirable natural forms of 
lipids to be used for diet purpose. The role of lipids, 
i.e. fats, which are saturated or comprise trans-unsaturated 
fatty acid glycerides in blood circulatory problems is well 
known. The use of vegetable oils which are comprised of 
cis-unsaturated fatty acid triglyceride in lieu of the 
aforesaid saturated fats or trans-unsaturated fatty acid 
triglycerides has been highly recommended to avoid the blood 
circulatory problems of the latter fats. One of the difficulties in implementing this 
recommendation is the physical form of the desirable 
vegetable oils, i.e. liquid form which is not always  
 
adaptable for many food uses. In the past, vegetable 
oils have been converted to the more useful semi-solid 
to solid state by hydrogenation which results in 
conversion of the vegetable oils to saturated fat and 
trans-unsaturated fatty acid glycerides. Therefore, the 
use of the desirable vegetable oils has been seriously 
limited in the food industry to only those situations 
where the liquid oil can be employed. The dietary importance of low-fat, low-calorie, no 
cholesterol foods is well-documented in not only the 
scientific literature but also in the lay press. 
Considerable research effort has been, and is now being, 
expended to meet the requirements of new food 
technology. Thus, low fat food products such as 
cheeses, mayonnaise, salad dressings, margarines and the 
like have been developed based on non-fat substitutions 
in whole or in part for the fat content of classical 
foods. Such products necessitate new food additives and 
constituents of the new dietary food compositions. 
These new additives and constituents are mainly designed 
to improve appearance, color, mouth-feel, and induce 
other properties to assure public acceptability of the 
new dietary compositions. To be successful, such 
additives and constituents should be food acceptable and 
compatible with the compositions in which they are 
employed. For example, titanium dioxide has been used 
as a whitener in low fat compositions and is found to be 
compatible in these compositions. However, the food-acceptability 
of titanium dioxide has been challenged 
and is rejected in many countries, especially in Europe. The present invention provides new and useful 
vegetable oil calcium citrate salt compositions which  
 
are readily
