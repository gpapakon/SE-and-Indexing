<ABSTRACT>
A filter module for filtering a flow of fluid employs a base member 
(20) which either mounts a blanking plug (14) or a diverter valve module 

(60). The plug (14) is replaced by a diverter valve module (60) for use 
with those engines that require an auxiliary source of low pressure fuel. 

A solenoid valve is housed in the module (60). A pressure 
regulator valve positioned in the valve module (60) maintains a 

backpressure in the filter assembly (10) to insure that there is sufficient 
head to drive the flow of fuel to the engine.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates generally to devices for filtering and
separating liquids. More particularly, the present invention relates to
filters for filtering fuel or lubricating oil of an internal combustion engine
and removing foreign particles and separating water therefrom.The absence of high standards of quality control in diesel fuel
supplies dictates that an effective fuel filter be incorporated into the fuel
supply system of a diesel engine. It is not uncommon for diesel fuel to
have significant quantities of abrasive particles and water. The abrasive
particles present the potential for permanent damage to components of
the fuel injection pump. The abrasive particles can also adversely affect
the performance of the pump by destroying the ability of the fuel
injection pump to precisely meter and deliver fuel at high pressures.
The presence of water in the diesel fuel supply can cause corrosion of
engine components, and during freezing conditions, can result in
interruption of the fuel injection system and/or seizure of moving
components. Similarly, water and particulate matter in the lubricating
oil must be removed to minimize wear of engine parts.Commonly, filters employ a disposable filter cartridge which is
replaced at pre-established intervals of filter usage. The cartridge is
secured to a base that is fixedly mounted to the engine header or some
other fixed location.Some engine designs require a source of low pressure fuel during
certain operating events, particularly while starting a cold engine. The
low pressure fuel is generally supplied by an injection fuel pump located
between the fuel filter and the engine.U.S. Patent No. 4,976,852 and U.S. Patent No. 5,084,170,
which are assigned to the assignee of the present invention, disclose
fuel filter assemblies to which the present invention relates. The fuel
filters employ a base which mounts a disposable filter cartridge. In 
some disclosed embodiments, the cartridge includes a single stage filter
system wherein fuel flows axially and radially to a filter element for
removing particulate matter. The filter element also functions as a
water barrier. Filtered fuel flows axially and exits through an outlet
passage of the base. The water may be collected in a sump and
periodically removed. The cartridge is secured to the base by a collar
which engages against a roll seam structure of the cartridge.EP-A-0 529 782 discloses a fuel filter assembly for filtering a
flow of fluid having a base defining a chamber and a cap for
sealing the chamber. The
