<ABSTRACT>
The narrow poly- or mono-dispersed oligomers of the present invention are polyureas, polycarbonates, polyesters or polyamides having a recurring unit of from 3 to 50. These oligomers are water-soluble, preferably have a rigid backbone, have recurring units coupled by carbonyl linking moieties which have anionic groups, display predominantly linear geometry such that regular spacing between anionic groups exists in an aqueous medium, and are pharmaceutically-acceptable. The narrow poly- or mono-dispersed oligomers are useful for the treatment and/or diagnosis of AIDS and/or ARC or HSV.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention concerns narrow poly- and mono-dispersed anionic 
oligomers, their preparation, formulations and use as valuable anti-human immunodeficiency 
virus activity agents. These monodispersed anionic oligomers are thus useful in the treatment 
of acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) and in the treatment of diseases caused by 
Herpes Simplex Virus (HSV) Types 1 and 2 and by Cytomegalovirus. A great deal of research is currently underway to develop treatments and cures 
for viral infections in humans and in animals, especially for Herpes Simplex Virus (HSV) Types 1 
and 2 and AIDS and AIDS related complex (ARC). Notably the incidence of AIDS and ARC in 
humans is increasing at an alarming rate. The five year survival rate for those with AIDS is 
dispiriting and AIDS patients, whose immune systems have been seriously impaired by the 
infection, suffer from numerous opportunistic infections including Kaposi's sarcoma and 
Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia. No cure for AIDS is known and current treatments are 
largely without adequate proof of efficacy and have numerous untoward side effects. Fear of 
the disease has resulted in social ostracism of and discrimination against those having or 
suspected of having the disease. Retroviruses are a class of ribonucleic acid (RNA) vi ruses that replicate by using 
reverse transcriptase to form a strand of complementary DNA (cDNA) from which a double 
stranded, proviral DNA is produced. This proviral DNA is then randomly incorporated into the 
chromosomal DNA of the host cell making possible viral replication by later translation of viral 
message from the integrated viral genome. Many of the known retroviruses are oncogenic or tumor causing. Indeed, the first 
two human retroviruses discovered, denoted human T-cell leukemia viruses I and II or HTLV-I 
and II, were found to cause rare leukemias in humans after infection of T-lymphocytes. The 
third such human virus to be discovered, HTLV-III, now referred to as HIV, was found to cause 
cell death after infection of T-lymphocytes and has been identified as the causative agent of 
AIDS and ARC.  
 The envelope protein of HIV is a 160 kDa glycoprotein. The protein is cleaved by a 
protease to give a 120 kDa external protein, gp 120, and a transmembrane glycoprotein, gp41. 
The gp 120 protein contains the amino acid sequence that recognizes the CD4 antigen on 
human T-helper (T4) cells. One approach being explored is to prevent the binding of HIV to its target, the T4 
cells in humans. These T4 cells
