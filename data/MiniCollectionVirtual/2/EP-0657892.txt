<ABSTRACT>
A semiconductor memory chip architecture is described in which 
implementation of a multi-bit data control function which 

enables independent control of at least a plurality of data 
bits via a single control signal. A logically organized memory 

chip is organized as a 2
n
X4 chip in which one control (CAS0) 
signal enables a single data bit and another control (CAS1) 

signal enables the remaining three data bits. By organizing 
data control on chips in this manner, it becomes possible to 

optimize design modules such that a minimum number of control 
signals are used.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to semiconductor memory array 
architectures in which a semiconductor memory array provides 
more than a single data bit for each chip access cycle, and 
more particularly to arrays in which subsets of data bits can 
be accessed independently. In the development of semiconductor memory technology the cost 
of developing new technology has lead to the practice that each 
succeeding generation of memory products contains four times 
the number of memory bits as the proceding generation. For 
example, the sequence of Dynamic RAM (DRAM) products has 
followed the geometrical series of 1-Megabit (Mb), 4Mb, 16Mb 
and 64Mb. (A megabit corresponds to 2²⁰ or 1,048,576 bits.) 
Each generation strives to provide similar functions and 
organizational features as found in previous generations; 
however, the compatibility of addressing schemes has dictated 
that each suceeding generation of Random Access Memory (RAM) 
utilize additional address input signals to address the 
increasing number of memory cells found in each suceeding 
generation of memory devices. The additional address input 
signals act to increase the memory depth of the DRAM memory 
device. Because the increase in depth or total addressable 
memory has out-stripped the utilization of memory at the system 
level, the historical tradition of providing only a single bit 
per DRAM chip has been altered to provide different granularity 
of data bits. For example, a 16Mb DRAM may be offered in 
organizations of 16MbX1, 4MbX4, 2MbX8, or even 1MbX16. (The 
"Xn" portion of such designation is recited as "by n", such as 
"by 1.") A X4 chip can be used to replace four X1 chips of the  
 
previous generation. These wider I/O chips enable later 
generations of technology to functionally replace earlier 
generations without requiring a completely new addressing 
scheme to be designed. In fabrication semiconductor memory devices it is a common 
practice to package a plurality of DRAM chips on a single 
assembly or sub-assembly called a single in-line package (SIP) 
or a single in-line memory module (SIMM) in which the memory 
components are organized to provide accessed memory data to a 
host processor or system in units known as bytes. Each data 
byte typically contains eight data bits, where each of the bits 
is supplied by one output of the plurality of DRAM chips 
comprising the memory system. The number of bytes which the 
memory system provides to the host processor, like the 
granularity of DRAMs, has typically been based on
