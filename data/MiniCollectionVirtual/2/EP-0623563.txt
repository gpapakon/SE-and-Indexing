<ABSTRACT>
In order to heat an elongate glass body which is to be used, for example, as a blank for drawing glass fibres, the glass body (3) is clamped, at its first end (9), into a rotatable first chuck (5) and the glass body (3) is introduced, by means of its second end (13), into a quartz tube (17), and this quartz tube (17) is clamped into a rotatable second chuck (7). A burner (23) which can be displaced parallel to the longitudinal axis (19) heats the elongate glass body (3) such that a so-called fire-polishing of the glass body (3) is carried out in order to improve the quality of its surface.

<CLAIMS>
Apparatus for the fire polishing of a long glass 
body, having a rotatable first chuck in which a first end 

of the glass body can be clamped in position, a 
displaceable torch, and a rotatable second chuck remote 

from the first chuck, characterized in that a quartz tube 
(17) is clamped in position in the second chuck (7), and 

in that the glass body (3) can be inserted at its second 
end (13) remote from the first end (9) into the quartz 

tube (17) and is guided by the latter without being 
fastened to it. 
Apparatus according to Claim 1, characterized in 
that the glass body (3) can be inserted into the quartz 

tube (17) with a point (15) formed on its second end 
(13). 
Apparatus according to Claim 1 or 2, characterized 
in that the quartz tube (17) is formed from the same 

material as the surface of the glass body (3). 
Method of fire polishing a long glass body, in 
which the glass body is clamped in position at its first 

end in a rotatable first chuck and is guided at its 
second end remote from this first end, the glass body is 

rotated about its longitudinal axis and is heated by 
means of a torch displaceable at least parallel to the 

longitudinal axis of the glass body, characterized in 
that the glass body (3) is guided at its second end (13) 

by inserting the second end (13) into a quartz tube (17) 
and by clamping the quartz tube (17) in position in a 

rotatable second chuck (7) remote from the first chuck 
(5) without fastening the glass body (3) to the quartz 

tube (17).  
 
Method according to Claim 4, characterized in 
that the glass body (3) is inserted into the quartz tube 

(17) with a point (15) formed on its second end (13).
