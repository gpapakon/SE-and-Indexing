<ABSTRACT>
Building structure as facade or roof, with at least one panel, e.g. a glass pane, which is fastened on a load-bearing structure by means of at least three retaining devices. All the retaining devices are provided with a universal joint on the part which is connected to the panel. A first of the retaining devices is connected rigidly to the load-bearing structure, and all the others are connected via a further joint.

Building construction in the form of a fa√ßade or roof,
comprising at least one panel (12), in particular a

glass pane, which is fastened by means of at least
three holding devices (1, 2, 3) to a supporting

structure (14), the following being provided:

the three holding devices (1, 2, 3) are apportioned to
the three corner points (21, 22, 23) of a theoretical

triangle and lie preferably each in a corner region of
the panel (12);
all of the holding devices (1, 2, 3, 4) each comprise
a panel holder (16) fastened to the panel (12), a

support holder (18) fastened to the supporting
structure (14), and connecting means (19) connecting

the two holders (16, 18) in each case to one another;
and
all of the panel holders (16) are provided with a
universal joint (26) having a swivelling centre (28),

about which each panel holder (16) in operation may
execute swivelling motions in all directions to a

limited extent relative to its associated connecting
means (19),
characterized in that the following is moreover
provided:
in the case of the first holding device (1), the
support holder (18) and the associated connecting

means (19) are designed in such a way that together
they form a flexurally stiff unit in all directions

perpendicular to the direction of connection of the
connecting means;
in the case of the second holding device (2), the
support holder (18) in operation is movable relative

to its connecting means (19) in the direction of the
distance of the second holding device (2) from the

first holding device (1), hereinafter referred to as
x-direction, but together with the connecting means 

(19) forms an immovably rigid unit in all directions
extending perpendicular to the x-direction;
in the case of the third holding device (3), the
support holder (18) in operation is movable relative

to its connecting means (19) in the direction of the
distance of the third holding device (3) from the

first holding device (1), hereinafter referred to as
y-direction;
the x-direction and the y-direction extend at right
angles to one another.
Building construction according to claim 1,

characterized in that

disposed in a fourth corner point (24), by means of
which the theoretical triangle is extended into a

theoretical rectangle, is a fourth holding device (4)
which connects the panel (12) to the supporting

structure (14), that the support holder (18) of said
fourth holding device (4) in operation is movable in

x-direction and in y-direction relative to its
connecting means (19).
Building construction according to one of the
preceding claims,

characterized in that

the support holder (18) of the third holding device
(3) in operation is movable also in x-direction

relative to its connecting means (19).
Building construction according to one of the
preceding claims,

characterized in that

the mobility of the support holder (18) of the second
holding device (2) is provided by means of a joint

(40), which has a swivelling axis (42) extending at
right angles to the x-direction and connects the

support holder (18) to the connecting means (19) but 
blocks a movement of the support holder (18) relative

to the connecting means (19) in all directions
extending perpendicular to the swivelling axis (42).
Building construction according to one of the
preceding claims,

characterized in that

the mobility of the support holder (18) of the third
holding device (3) relative to its connecting means

(19) is provided by means of a joint (50), which has a
swivelling axis (42) extending at right angles to the

y-direction and connects the support holder (18) to
the associated connecting means (19) so that they are

capable of swivelling relative to one another.
Building construction according to one of the
preceding claims,

characterized in that

the support holder (18) and its connecting means (19)
of the third holding device (3) together form a

flexurally stiff unit in all directions extending
perpendicular to the y-direction.
Building construction according to one of the
preceding claims,

characterized in that

the mobility of the support holder (18) of the third
holding device (3) relative to its connecting means

(19) is provided by means of a universal joint (50;
56; 64) 
which connects the support holder (18) to its
connecting means (19), that the universal joint has a

swivel point (48) about which che support (18) in
operation is capable of swivelling to a limited extent

in all directions, including in x-direction and in
y-direction, relative to its connecting means (19) of

said third holding device (3). 
Building construction according to one of claims 2 to
7,

characterized in that

the mobility of the support holder (18) of the fourth
holding device (4) relative to its connecting means

(19) is provided by means of a universal joint (50;
56; 64), by which they are connected so as to be

capable of swivelling and which has a swivelling
centre (48), about which the support holder (18) in

operation is capable of swivelling to a limited extent
in all directions, including in x-direction and in

y-direction, relative to its connecting means (19).
Building construction according to one of the
preceding claims,

characterized in that

the y-direction extends at right angles to the
x-direction.
Building construction according to one of the
preceding claims,

characterized in that

the x-direction and the y-direction lie in a common
plane, which lies plane-parallel to the plane of the

panel (12).
