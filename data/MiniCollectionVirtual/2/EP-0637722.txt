<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a method for controlling the temperature of rooms in buildings having an air circuit and having water circuits at least for heating purposes, the building possessing an effective heat insulation. In order to make possible low electric connected loads for the air-conditioning of the building and the utilisation of periods of favourable electricity tariffs, it is proposed that, for the purpose of influencing the temperature, quantities of heat are admitted to or removed from corresponding building masses via pipes for the water circuit which are laid in the building masses. As a result, the building masses can be used as heat accumulators for the air-conditioning of dwelling rooms, it being possible to replenish the accumulators slowly and during periods of favourable electricity tariffs.

<CLAIMS>
A method for controlling the temperature of rooms in
buildings, comprising an air circuit conducted through

the intermediate space between the exterior walls and
a further cover and comprising water circuits at least

for heating purposes, characterised in that for
temperature control, quantities of heat from the air

circuit are temporarily stored by feeding them into
respective building structures by way of pipelines for

the water circuit (9) installed inside the building
structures, or by withdrawing them from the said

building structures.
A method according to claim 1, characterised in that
quantities of heat to be fed in or withdrawn for

cooling or heating are moved to-and-fro within the
building structures.
A method according to one of claim 1 or 2,
characterised in that a quantity of heat is withdrawn

from at least the building exhaust air taken from the
air circuit (10) and supplied to the water circuit

(9).
A method according to one of claims 1 to 3,
characterised in that during cooling operations the

quantity of heat taken from the interior rooms (6) to
be cooled is temporarily stored in the cellar

structures of the building from where it is withdrawn
to cover the heat requirement of other buildings or

installations or from where it is continuously
conveyed to the outside ambient air.
A method at least according to claim 1, characterised
in that at least part of the building structures which

are not used to delimit the interior rooms (6) in 
which the temperature is to be controlled, are heated

or cooled, depending on the temperature requirements,
at times when the electricity rate is favourable, with

temperature control taking place by feeding heat to,
or withdrawing heat from the said part of the building

structures.
A device for implementing the method according to one
of claims 1 to 5, characterised by at least one water

circuit (9) whose pipelines are routed in the building
structures of a building acting in unison with at

least one water-water heat pump (5, W-W HP 1/2) and at
least one air-water heat exchanger (1, A-W HE 1/2)

situated in the air circuit (10) of the building, with
the water circuit (9) being ducted through the

intermediate space between the exterior walls and a
further cover.
A device according to claim 6, characterised in that
the air circuit (10) of the building comprises fresh

air ducting and exhaust air ducting, with an air-water
heat exchanger (1, A-W HE 1/2) which is situated in

the water circuit (9) and through which exhaust air or
fresh air flows, being allocated at least to the

exhaust air ducting or the fresh-air ducting.
A device according to claim 7, characterised in that
the air-water heat exchanger (1, A-W HE 1/2) comprises

a plural number of pipelines (13), each configured as
a helical pipe arrangement coaxially arranged one

above the other arrangement and each comprising an
inlet and an outlet, with all pipes (13) arranged

spaced apart from each other, through which space the
air of the air circuit (10) is able to flow, with the

inlet and outlet each being connected to a distributor 
(14, 14') through which they are in communication with

the water circuit (9).
A device according to at least one of claims 6 to 8,
characterised in that absorbers from solar collectors

(2) are integrated into the water circuits (9) and/or
the air circuits (10).
