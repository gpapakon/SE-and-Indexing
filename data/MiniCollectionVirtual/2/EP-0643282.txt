<ABSTRACT>
The optical device makes it possible to measure the transverse offset, with respect to an optical axis, of an object (10) which can be moved along the axis over a length which is greater by several orders of magnitude than the maximum transverse dimension acceptable for the pupil of the device. It comprises a luminous pattern placed on the object and, in this order, along the optical axis, a fixed afocal dioptric system (22) with axial magnification less than 1/10, an optical viewer (24) of fixed focal length, which can be moved along the optical axis and is intended to sight the image supplied by the afocal system, having a magnification greater than unity, and an array (matrix) detector (20) which is fixed with respect to the optics of the viewer. Means (28) make it possible to determine the centre of gravity of the image formed on the detector and the offset of this centre of gravity with respect to the optical axis.
