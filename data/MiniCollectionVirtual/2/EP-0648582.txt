<ABSTRACT>
A rotary impacting apparatus (1) comprises a housing (2), a 
rotor (7) rotated in the housing (2), an impact member (16) 

eccentrically held by the rotor (7), and a main reciprocative 
implement (11) held reciprocatively at a forward end portion of 

the housing (2). The rotor (7) rotates to hit the impact member 
(16) for driving the main reciprocative implement (11) into the 

ground for instance. The apparatus (1) further includes an 
auxiliary oscillating mechanism (13) for transmitting an impacting 

force from the impact member (16) to pull the main receprocative 
implement (11) when the housing (2) is pulled relative to the main 

receprocative implement (11) by a predetermined distance.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a rotary impacting apparatus, 
and more specifically to a rotary impacting apparatus suitable to 
such tasks as underground root cutting or plant cutting above the 
ground. Generally, the impacting apparatus represented for instance 
by a concrete breaker utilizes expansive force of compressed air 
or a combination of a prime motor and a crank mechanism for 
forcibly reciprocating an impacting piston in the main body. When 
reciprocated, the impacting piston repetitively hits a 
reciprocating implement supported at an end portion of the main 
body in an axial direction. Recently, however, a new type of impacting apparatus 
differing from the reciprocating type described hereinabove has 
been introduced. This type, called "rotary impacting apparatus", 
is developed for decreasing the reaction of the impact and 
increasing the impacting frequency. The basic constitution of 
the rotary impacting apparatus is disclosed, for instance, in the 
United States Patent No. 5,002,134. The apparatus disclosed in the above United States Patent 
corresponds to the preamble of claim 1 and 
comprises a housing in which a rotor is driven by a drive source, 
and an impact member of a predetermined mass loosely and 
eccentrically held by the rotor. When the rotor rotates, the 
impact member repeatedly hits the top end of a reciprocative 
implement slidably supported by the housing, thereby driving the 
reciprocative implement. When using the rotary impacting apparatus, the operator  
 
supports the apparatus by holding a grip portion of a handle with 
the forward end of the reciprocative implement held against the 
ground for instance. The drive source is then turned on to 
rotate the rotor for causing the impact member to repeatedly hit 
the top end of the reciprocating implement, thereby driving the 
reciprocative implement into the ground. At the lower end of the 
reciprocative implement, there is mounted or integrally formed a 
suitably shaped tool such as blade or shovel depending on the 
applications. One of such applications is the removal of a tree from the 
ground for shipment. For reliably performing the removal which is 
followed by subsequent re-planting and growing thereof, the 
entire root system of the tree must be carefully trimmed about a 
year before the planned shipment. This root trimming procedure 
must be performed thoroughly so that no root branches are left 
untrimmed, and for this purpose it is necessary to drive the tip 
of the reciprocative implement down to 50cm
