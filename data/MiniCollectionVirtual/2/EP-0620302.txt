<ABSTRACT>
A cooling apparatus of a high speed false texturing 
machine is provided by which so-called surging phenomenon is 

prevented, yarn breakages are not increased, unevenness in 
dyeing is not occurred, and deterioration of crimp 

characteristics in a obtained textures yarn does not occur. 
A false texturing machine comprises a false twisting device 

(5) for imparting twists to a yarn (2), a heating apparatus 
(3), disposed upstream the false twisting device (5), for 

heat setting twists run back along the yarn (2), and a 
cooling apparatus (4, 5), disposed between the heating 

apparatus (3) and the false twisting device (5), for cooling 
the yarn. The cooling apparatus (4) comprises a plurality 

of partial cooling plates (8). A yarn pressing member (9) 
serves to insert the yarn (2) into a space between the 

adjacent partial cooling plates (8) beyond a common 
contacting line of the adjacent partial cooling plates (8).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an improvement of a 
cooling apparatus of a false texturing machine, such as a 
draw texturing machine or a false twist texturing machine. 
More specifically, the present invention relates to a 
cooling apparatus of a false texturing machine, by which so 
called surging phenomenon can be prevented from occurring 
during high speed false twisting operation. The so called 
surging phenomenon means a phenomenon wherein a yarn 
generates a ballooning, i.e., a kind of rolling, of a yarn 
in a twisting zone when the false twist texturing speed is 
excessively increased, and abnormal variation in tension of 
the twisted yarn is resulted in. A false texturing machine comprises a false twisting 
device for imparting twists to a yarn, and a heating 
apparatus, disposed upstream the false twisting device, for 
heat setting twists run back along the yarn. Further, a 
draw texturing machine is provided with a drawing device for 
drawing the yarn at a predetermined draw ratio prior to or 
simultaneously with the twist setting by the above-described 
heating apparatus and the false twisting device. Texturing 
machines of this type are known from US-A-3 368 335, 
CH-A-583 793 and FR-A-2 451 415. In a conventional operation, wherein false twist 
texturing speed is up to 100 m/min, it is sufficient for a 
yarn to be cooled by natural seasoning just after it is heat 
set by the heating apparatus. In other words, no 
specifically designed cooling apparatus is required. However, as the false twist texturing speed increases,  
 
the yarn cannot be fully cooled only by a conventional 
natural seasoning. In addition, when the twisted yarn runs 
at a high speed, ballooning at the cooling region increases. 
Thus, recently, a yarn is forced to run in contact with a 
cooling apparatus so as to restrict occurrence of the 
ballooning. When the false twist texturing speed is further 
increased and reaches a super high speed, i.e., a speed 
equal to or higher than 1,000 m/min, a surging phenomenon, 
i.e., a large waved vibration, occurs in a yarn running 
through the cooling apparatus. More specifically, the yarn 
is subjected to a ballooning, i.e., rolling, in the twisting 
zone, and abnormal variation in tension of the twisted yarn 
occurs. Especially when a high temperature heating 
apparatus, wherein a yarn is heated to a temperature higher 
than 300°C, is used, unevenness in dyeing or yarn breakages 
may occur easily. It is possible to increase the tension in yarn at the 
false twisting region in
