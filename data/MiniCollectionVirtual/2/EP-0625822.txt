<ABSTRACT>
In a semiconductor integrated circuit, an amplifier FET 
(1) and a gate bias FET (4) having the same structure as the 

amplifier FET and a total gate width smaller than that of 
the amplifier FET are disposed closely to each other. The 

gate bias FET (4) is a constituent of a gate bias circuit 
for the amplifier FET (1), and the gate bias circuit is 

constituted so that the current value determined by the 
drain current of the gate bias FET (4), first and second 

resistors (R₁,R₂) respectively connected to source and drain 
of the gate bias FET (4), and a diode (11) connected to the 

resistors (R₁,R₂) in series is applied to the amplifier FET 
(1) as a gate bias voltage. In this structure, if the DC 

characteristic of the amplifier FET (1) varies from chip to 
chip, the DC characteristic of the gate bias FET (4) that is 

formed in the vicinity of and in the same process as the 
amplifier FET also varies. Therefore, it is possible to 

make the operating current value I
d1
 of the amplifier FET 
(1) consistent throughout a plurality of IC chips regardless 

of differences in the drain current value of the first FET, 
resulting in uniform high frequency characteristics, such as 

input-output characteristics, of the IC chips.
