<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a device for gaseous fluid removal, in particular dicharged gases or smoke, comprising an upper element (2) and a lower element (3), which are superposed, coaxial and rigidly fixed to one another by connection braces (4), the lower element (3) comprising a lower bottom (5) and a lower cover (6) each of which are of general frustoconical shape and passed through coaxially by a pipe (7) of given diameter d opening at one of its ends (15), on the side of the lower cover (6), into the space (8) comprised between the two elements (2, 3), the other end being fixed to the gaseous fluid inlet, which are rigidly fixed to one another by their large common base (9), the lower cover (6) being provided with an annular lip (10) which is contiguous to the large common base (9), directed downwards from the large base (9) and in continuation of the surface of the lower cover (6), the upper element (2) comprising an upper cover (12) in the general shape of a cone and an upper bottom (11) which are fixed rigidly to one another by their large common base (13), the upper cover (12) being provided with an annular lip (14) which is contiguous to the large common base (13), directed downwards from the large base (13) and in continuation of the surface of the upper cover (12). According to the invention, the annular lip (10) comes to continue directly the frustoconical surface of the lower cover (6) and the connection braces (4) rest on the frustoconical surface of the lower cover (6).

A device for discharging gaseous fluid, notably
ejected gases or smoke, comprising an upper element (2)

of diameter D and a lower element (3), both superimposed
and coaxial and fixed rigidly to each other by connecting

struts (4); the lower element (3) comprising a lower
bottom (5) and a lower cover (6), each in the general

shape of a truncated cone, having a pipe (7) of given
diameter d passing through them coaxially and opening out

at one of its ends (15), on the same side as the lower
cover (6), in the space (8) between the two elements (2,

3), the other end being fixed to the gaseous fluid inlet,
the lower bottom (5) and the lower cover (6) being

rigidly fixed to each other by their large common base
(9); the lower cover (6) being provided with an annular

lip (10), adjoining the large common base (9), directed
downwards from the large base (9) and in direct line with

the surface of the lower cover (6); the upper element (2)
comprising an upper cover (12) in the general shape of a

cone and an upper bottom (11), rigidly fixed to each
other by their large common base (13), the upper cover

(12) being provided with an annular lip (14), adjoining
the large common base (13), directed downwards from the

large base (13) and in line with the surface of the upper
cover (12); the connecting struts (4) resting on the

truncated-cone surface of the lower cover (6);

   characterised in that the lower bottom (5)
comprises a peripheral collar (17c) parallel to the

truncated-cone surface of the lower cover (6).
A device according to Claim 1, characterised in
that the upper bottom (11) and the upper cover (12) each

comprise a facing transverse peripheral collar (17a,
17b), defining a transverse band for mounting and fixing 

the end, on the same side as the upper element (2), of
the struts (4) on the upper element (2), the annular lip

(14) coming in line with the peripheral collar (17a) on
the upper cover (2) and overlapping the peripheral collar

(17b) on the upper bottom (11).
A device according to Claim 1 or 2,
characterised in that the small base of the lower cover

comprises an annular projection (16) of axial direction

0.01 and 0.04, and preferably substantially equal to
0.0125.
A device according to Claim 3, characterised in
that the axial annular projection (16) is produced by the

end (15) of the pipe (7) projecting beyond the small base
of the lower cover (6).
