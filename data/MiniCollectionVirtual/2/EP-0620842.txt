<ABSTRACT>
The invention presented relates to a method for reducing the emission of nitrogen oxides from a diesel engine without significant loss of fuel efficiency and without significant increases in carbon monoxide and hydrocarbon emissions. The method involves preparing a diesel engine such that the injection timing thereof is set at a point sufficient to obtain reductions in the nitrogen oxides emissions from the engine; and firing the diesel engine with a diesel fuel having admixed therein an additive which comprises a fuel soluble organometallic platinum group metal coordination composition.

 DESCRIPTION"Method For Reducing Pollution Emissions From a Diesel Engine With OrganometaUic Platinum Group Metal Coordination Composition."Related ApplicationsThis application is a continuation-in-part of copending and commonly assigned U.S. Patent Application having Serial No. 07/794,329 entitled "Method for Reducing Emissions from or Increasing the Utilizable Energy of Fuel for Powering Internal Combustion Engines", filed in the names of Epperly, Sprague, Kelso, and Bowers on November 12, 1991, which in turn is a continuation of U.S. Patent Application Serial No. 07/291,245, filed December 28, 1991, the disclosures of each of which are hereby incorporated by reference.Technical FieldThe present invention relates to a method effective for reducing nitrogen oxides reductions from a diesel engine. The practice of the inventive method permits the reduction of the emission of nitrogen oxides (NO.*, where x is an integer, generally 1 or 2) without significantly sacrificing fuel efficiency and without causing a significant increase in the emission of carbon monoxide (CO) and/or unburned hydrocarbons. 

 Background ArtAs acknowledged by Needham, Doyle, and Nicol, in "The Low Ox Truck Engine", Society of Automotive Engineers (SAE), Paper No. 910731, the reduction of nitrogen oxides emissions from diesel engines can be achieved by retarding the injection timing of the engine. Although there is little doubt that such timing changes are effective at reducing NO-* emissions, they carry with them the disadvantage that fuel consumption rates and emission of carbon monoxide and unburned hydrocarbons suffer as a trade-off for the NOx reductions achieved.These results are confirmed by the work of Wasser and Perry in "Diesel Engine NO^ Control: Selective Catalytic Reduction and Methanol Emulsion", EPRI/EPA Joint Symposium on Stationary NOx Control, New Orleans, Louisiana, March, 1987. Engine timing modification, therefore, is not a complete answer to the emissions of pollutants such as nitrogen oxides from diesel engines.The desirability of improving the efficiency of combustion in a vehicle's engine to, inter alia, reduce NOx emissions, has long been recognized. For instance, Lyons and McKone in U.S. Patent 2,086,775, and again in U.S. Patent 2,151,432, disclose a method for improving combustion efficiency in an internal combustion engine by adding to the fuel what is described as "relatively minute quantities" of catalytic organometallic compounds. The Lyons and McKone patents, though, are directed solely to
