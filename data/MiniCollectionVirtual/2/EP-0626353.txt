<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a glass-ceramic having
a crystal structure suitable for use as a material for
a magnetic disk substrate and having improved surface
characteristics after polishing and a method for
manufacturing the same.There has been a rapid progress in developments in
magnetic disks demand for which has recently increased
remarkably as external media of large scale computers
and personal computers. Characteristics required
generally for a magnetic disk substrate are as follows:
(1) In CSS (contact start and stop) characteristics of a
magnetic disk, the magnetic disk should have not a
completely smooth surface but a surface whose surface
roughness (Ra) is controlled to a range from 15 Å to 50
Å in order to prevent stiction between the head and the
disk and damage to the head and media.(2) Since the amount of lifting of the head tends to
decrease to the order of 0.1 µm to 0.05 µm owing to
improvement of recording density of the magnetic disk,
the surface of the disk must be flat and relatively
smooth.(3) The material of the magnetic disk substrate must 
not include anisotropic crystal or other defects and its
structure must be dense, homogenious and fine.(4) The material must have sufficient mechanical
strength and hardness for standing a high speed rotation
and contact with the head.(5) The material must not contain Na2O ingredient in
principle because the Na2O ingredient causes dispersion
of sodium ion during the film forming process with
resulting deterioration in characteristics of the film.(6) The material must have chemical durability against
rinsing and etching with various chemicals.Aluminum alloy has been conventionally used as a
material of magnetic disk substrate. The alluminum
alloy substrate, however, tends to produce a substrate
surface having projections or spot-like projections and
depressions during the polishing process due to defects
inherent in the material. As a result, the alluminum
alloy substrate is not sufficient in flatness and
surface roughness and cannot cope with the recent
requirement for high density recording necessitated by
increase in the amount of information.As a material for overcoming this problem of the
alluminum alloy substrate, known in the art is a glass
substrate for magnetic disks made of chemically tempered
glass. This glass substrate, however, has the following
disadvantages: 
(1) Polishing is made after chemical tempering and so
the tempered layer tends to cause instability in
thinning the disk substrate.(2) For improving the CSS characteristics,
