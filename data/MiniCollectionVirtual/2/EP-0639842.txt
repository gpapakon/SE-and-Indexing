<ABSTRACT>
A switch body (2), which is arranged such that it can move and varies its position with respect to a switching element (3) as a function of its orientation, as well as an electronic switching device (4) are arranged within the housing (1) of the orientation switch. The electronic switching device (4) is located between two connections (6) and (7) which pass out of the housing (1), and is coupled to the switching element (3) which operates the switching device (4). The switching device (4) switches a large current flowing via the pair of connections (6, 7) and, in addition, limits the current flowing through the switching element (3) in its switched-on state, as well as the voltage dropped across the switching element (3) in its switched-off state. As a result of the limited current and voltage levels, the switching element (3) can be a relatively small and light mechanical switch or reed contact.
