<DESCRIPTION>
The field of the present invention is recombinant
retroviruses that are useful to produce antigens.Retroviruses are a type of RNA virus that replicate
through a DNA intermediate. Fig. 1 illustrates examples of
two types of retroviruses - simpler "S Type" and more
complex "MC Type". All retroviruses have gag, pol, and env
genes. For some retroviruses (e.g. spleen necrosis virus;
murine leukemia virus) only these genes are needed for viral
replication. Such viruses are called "simpler" or "S Type"
retroviruses. (Seee.g. U.S. patents 4,650,764; 4,980,289;
and 5,124,263.
Other
retroviruses, called "more complex" or "MC Type"
retroviruses, need additional genes for replication. Among
the more complex retroviruses are human immunodeficiency
virus (HIV), human spumaretrovirus, human T-lymphotropic
virus type I (HTLV-I), and bovine leukemia virus (BLV).The additional genes of the more complex retroviruses
are thought essential for replication of the natural virus.
In this regard, the additional genes in complex retroviruses
are known to code for proteins that act on transcription,
splicing, and polyadenylation. Seegenerally H. Temin, et
al., The Retroviridae, v. 1, New York, 1, 5 (1992). The genomes of both simpler and more complex
retroviruses have some common features. Both types of RNA
viruses replicate through a DNA intermediate. Therefore,
both simpler and more complex retroviruses have DNA and RNA
genomes. The viral DNA genomes for both types of
retroviruses are bounded by long terminal repeats (LTRs).
These LTRs contain enhancer, promoter, usually 3' RNA
processing sequences, and integration sequences ("att").Simpler and more complex retroviruses have different
infection cycles. Temin (The Retroviridae, Supra pp. 1, 6-7)
describes these two different infection cycles. The
primary difference relates to the involvement of regulatory
proteins in the more complex retrovirus cycle.In nature, disease caused by simpler retroviruses are
found in various non-mammalian hosts, but not primates or
ungulates. However, diseases caused by more complex
retroviruses are prevalent in ungulates and primates
(especially humans).For many more complex retroviruses there is, as yet, no
safe and effective vaccine against the disease caused by the
virus. Reasons for this are believed to be that certain
more complex regulatory retroviral proteins interfere with
the immune response and/or that retroviruses tend to mutate
too rapidly invivo for the body to provide a long-term
immune response. Therefore, there is a need to find a
