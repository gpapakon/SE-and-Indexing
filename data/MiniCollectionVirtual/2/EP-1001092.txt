<ABSTRACT>
The terminal plate (15,16) locates on the face wooden surfaces (19,21) of the corresponding wooden post head (10,14) after application of the tubular section (17,18). A coupling part (12) has an intermediary plate (23) for location on the terminal plate in the face wooden surface of the wooden post head. On the side surfaces of the intermediate plate tube section arrangements (25,26) are fixed for producing the impact connection. These tube section arrangements have a greater length and greater diameter in comparison with the tube section of the wedge part.

<CLAIMS>
Device for making a butt joint between a timber pile (10) and another timber pile
(14) or a concrete top attachment (38) or as pile head driving locking element,

consisting of

a key element (11, 13) provided for the application on each timber pile head (10,
14) to be connected, including a tube section (17, 18) or a topping plate (15, 16)

attached thereon for bearing against the timber face (19, 21) of the associated
timber pile head (10, 14) after insertion of said tube section (17, 18), and of

a coupler element (12) with an intermediate plate (23) provided for bearing
against said topping plate (15, 16) in said timber face (19, 21) of the respective

timber pile head (10, 14), with tube section groups (25, 26) being fastened on the
side surfaces of said intermediate plate, which are facing said timber pile heads,

for making the butt joint, which tube section groups present a longer length and a
wider diameter, compared against said tube section (17, 18) of said key element

(11,13).
Device according to Claim 1, 
characterised in that
 said key element (11, 13) and
said coupler element (12) are made of steel, preferably stainless steel.
Device according to Claim 1 or 2, 
characterised in that
 the free end of each tube
section (17, 18) of said key element is chamfered in a blade-like manner from the

outside towards the inside.
Device according to any of the preceding Claims, 
characterised in that
 each tube
section group (25, 26) comprises a first section (27, 28) having a longer diameter,

in which a second section (29, 30) is inserted and fastened, which has a smaller
diameter. 
Device according to Claim 4, 
characterised in that
 said second tube section (29,
30) is inserted into said first tube section (27, 28) by such a length that the remaining

length of the distance of said first tube section (27, 28) from said intermediate
plate (23) corresponds approximately to the length of said tube section

(17, 18) of said key element (11, 13).
Device according to Claim 4 or 5, 
characterised in that
 said second tube section
(29, 30) is chamfered on its free end in a blade-shaped form towards the outside.
Device according to any of the Claims 4 to 6, 
characterised in that
 the overlapping
fastening region of said first and second tube sections (27, 29) or (28, 30),

respectively, presents inclined ends (31, 32, 33, 34).
Device according to any of the preceding Claims, 
characterised in that
 the length
of each tube section group (25, 26) corresponds to more than twice the length of

said tube section (17, 18) of said key element (11, 13).
Device according to any of the preceding Claims, 
characterised in that
 a drive
pipe (35) is provided for said coupler element (12) for driving into a timber pile

head (10), which pipe is adapted for insertion into the free tube section group
(25).
Device according to Claim 9, 
characterised in that
 said drive pipe (35) is fitted into
and guided in said tube section (29) and comprises a topping plate (36) having

the same diameter.
Device according to any of the preceding Claims, 
characterised in that
 a formwork
tube is provided for the production of a concrete top attachment (38), which

is fitted around and surrounds said first tube section (27) of said coupler element

(12) and interacts with said coupler element (12) to form a concrete head-receiving
section. 
Method of making a butt joint between timber piles with a device according to
any of the Claims 1 to 8, comprising the following steps:


(a) a key element (11) is centrally placed and fixed on a pile head;
(b) a coupler element (12) is centrally placed and fixed on said pile head over
said key element (11);
(c) a second key element (13) is centrally placed into the free end of said coupler
element (12) in a loose manner whilst it is locked in its position by said

key element connecting plate (14), with an orientation opposite to said first
key element (12);
(d) the timber pile envisaged for extension is placed by its pile head to be connected
onto the free end of said coupler element (12); and
(e) driving energy is applied onto the timber pile mentioned last, with said coupler
element (12) being initially driven in alone and, after its bearing engagement

with both key elements (11, 13), said coupler element (12) and
said key elements (11, 13) being jointly driven into the respective pile heads

up to their flush bearing engagement.
Method of making a butt joint between a timber pile and a drive pipe or a concrete
top attachment with a device according to Claim 10 or 11, comprising the

following steps:

(a) said key element (11) is centrally placed and fixed on a pile head;
(b) said coupler element (12) is centrally placed and fixed on said pile head
over said key element (11);
(c) driving energy is applied by means of a drive pipe (35) inserted into the free
tube section of said coupler element (12), with said coupler element (12)

being initially driven in alone and, after its bearing engagement with said key
element (11), said coupler element (12) and said key element (11) being

jointly driven into said pile head up to their flush bearing engagement; and
(d) a formwork tube (37) is placed about the free tube section group of said
coupler element (12) down to said intermediate plate (23) thereof and insertion

of a concrete top attachment (38) into the interior of said formwork tube
(37) and said tube section group (25).
