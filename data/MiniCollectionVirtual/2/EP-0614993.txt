<ABSTRACT>
A method for sintering iron scraps used in a process for 
producing sintered ore serving as a raw material in iron making 

in a blast furnace or the like. Eliminating Zn in iron scraps 
during a sintering process makes it possible to use a large 

amount of light-weight iron scraps in a blast furnace and also 
to improve the yield in production of sintered ore during the 

sintering process. In producing sintered ore used as a raw material 
for blast furnacing with a Dwight Lloyd type sintering 

machine, a mixture obtained by mixing small iron scrap chips 
into a raw material for sintered ore is placed on a pallet to 

thereby produce scrap-containing sintered ore. In compounding 
into a loading layer, it is possible to select between three 

methods, compounding into all layers, compounding only into 
an upper layer, and compounding only into a lower layer. Iron 

scraps are fixed in sintered ore to serve as a raw material used 
in a blast furnace. Furthermore, with this method, the amount 

of coke used as a heat source can be reduced and generation 
of CO₂ and NO₂ by burnt coke can be restricted.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a process for
producing a sintered ore for use as a raw material for
the production of molten metal in a blast furnace and the
like and particularly to a process for producing a
sintered ore which enables recovered iron scrap to be
reused as a raw material for iron in a blast furnace.In recent years, a large quantity of an iron scrap
called light-weight debris derived from automobiles,
domestic electric appliances, vessels, etc. (hereinafter
referred to simply as "scrap") has become available,
which has led to an ever-increasing demand for the
utilization thereof. This type of scrap is chipped into
smaller debris by a shredder or a cutter. However, the
debris is still so bulky that it is unwelcome for use in
an electric furnace, a converter or the like.
Consequently, at the present time, in many cases, large
scrap, having a good quality called "heavy debris", is
used in an electric furnace, converter, etc. In the
past, tests for direct use of light-weight debris in a
blast furnace have been carried out. However, there
occurred significant problems including separation from
ore and segregation, breaking of a transport conveyor
belt and clogging of a charge device and, in a
blast furnace, classification and segregation occurring
in an accumulated ore bed, so that it is difficult to
steadily use the heavy scrap without disturbing the
operation of the blast furnace. If the light-weight iron
scrap, which has been chipped, could be charged in a lump
form into a blast furnace, a reducing furnace or the like
as in the ore or sintered ore, the above-described
problems associated with use in a blast furnace can be 
eliminated. However, no lumping method has hitherto been
disclosed.On the other hand, when scrap derived from
galvanized steel sheets which occurs in a relatively
large quantity, as such, is used in a blast furnace, fumy
dust of ZnO occur in the blast furnace and accumulate on
the surface of the furnace wall to form a deposit. For
this reason, at the present time, the amount of zinc
derived from ores and coke is limited to not more than
about 0.2 kg/t-pig. For this reason, no attempt to
directly use zinc-containing scrap in a high proportion
in a blast furnace has been made in the art.A schematic flow diagram of the conventional
process for producing a sintered ore is shown in Fig.
1(a).An ore as a main raw material, lime as an auxiliary
material, coke as a fuel and return fines are taken off
in respective amounts respectively from an ore hopper 1,
a lime hopper 3, a
