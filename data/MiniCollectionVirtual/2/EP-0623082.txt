play "S" inside two coupling hubs (22 and 23) driven 

by the reduction gearing (worm gear 15, 16) in such 
a way 
that, upon a steering movement, there occurs as a 
function of the exerted steering moment a polygonal

clamping sleeve (27) towards one or the other 

coupling hub (22 or 23) depending on the steering 
direction.

(A) are disposed between two rows of slots (40 and 

41) which are positionally aligned with one another;

section (B) lie at the outer edge (37) next to a 

further row of slots (42) which are disposed offset 
relative to the aligned slots (40 and 41) and 
the clamping elements (28 and 30) lie against the 
internal diameter of the clamping sleeve (27) in 

clamping bevels (35 and 36), whose angles of 
inclination in one operating section (A) extend in 

the opposite direction to the other operating 
section (B) (Fig.1). 
Power-assisted steering device according to claim 1,

fastened by means of a notched toothing (34) on the 
output shaft (3) and the latter in a bell-like manner 

embraces the steering shaft (1) (Fig.1). 
Power-assisted steering device according to claim 3, 
characterized in that the clamping rollers (28 and 30) of 

each operating section (A and B) are situated centrically 
in relation to the slots (40, 41 and 42) (Fig.7). 
Power-assisted steering device according to claim 1, 
characterized by the following features:

and 45), which extend axially inwards from both end 

faces and are offset relative to one another, and 
the clamping elements (46, 47) are disposed in the 
extension of the slots (44 and 45) (Fig.8). 
Power-assisted steering device according to claim 1, 
characterized by the following features: 


the clamping sleeve (48) in its one operating  
 

section (A) has U-shaped slots (50), which are open 
in a peripheral direction and inside which the 

clamping elements (53) of one row are situated, and 
the other operating section (B) has L-shaped slots 
(51), whose short limbs (51) are directed towards 

the edge and which encompass the clamping elements 
(54) of the other row (Fig.9). 
Power-assisted steering device according to claim 1, 
characterized by the following features: 


the clamping sleeve (49) has two rows of slots (55 
and 56) extending in a peripheral direction and 

aligned with one another, with clamping elements 
(57) being disposed in the one operating section (A) 

between every second pair of slots (55 and 56), and 
the clamping elements (58) of the other operating 
section (B) are situated, offset in relation to the
