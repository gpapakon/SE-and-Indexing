<ABSTRACT>
Procedure for the design and construction of a multi-purpose end-effector intended for manipulating and securing pieces (A) exhibiting dimensional variations one to another. Various elements of the end-effector such as the grips (5, 6) and their control and displacement means (7, 8) are specified as a function of the dimensional variations of the pieces by choosing, from all possible solutions for grasping the pieces by their edge or top surfaces, the one which minimises the loads to be exerted. Application to the manipulation of a piece which is to be secured to another with the aid of a robot which is itself to perform the handling and assembly.
