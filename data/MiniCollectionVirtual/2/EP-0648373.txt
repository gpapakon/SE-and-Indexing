<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates generally to preparation
of thin film semiconductor materials. Specifically the
invention relates to the glow discharge deposition of Group
IV semiconductor alloy materials; and more specifically,
the invention relates to a microwave energized glow
discharge deposition process in which Group IV
semiconductor alloys are deposited on substrates maintained
in a particular temperature regime.Glow discharge decomposition is employed for the
preparation of thin films of a variety of materials such as
semiconductor materials, insulating materials, optical
coatings, polymers and the like. In a typical glow
discharge deposition, a process gas which includes a
precursor of the material being deposited, is introduced
into a deposition chamber, typically at subatmospheric
pressure. Electromagnetic energy, either AC or DC, is
introduced into the chamber and energizes the process gas
so as to create an excited plasma therefrom. The plasma
decomposes the precursor material and deposits a coating on
a substrate maintained proximate the plasma region.
Frequently the substrate is heated to facilitate growth of
the deposit thereupon. This technology is well known in
the art. Early glow discharge depositions employed either 
direct current, low frequency alternating current or radio
frequency alternating current to energize the plasma; radio
frequency current is still very widely employed for this
purpose.One particular drawback to certain prior art glow
discharge deposition processes was their relatively low
speed, and in an attempt to increase deposition rates those
of skill in the art turned to the use of microwave
energized plasmas. It was found that microwave energized
glow discharge processes provided very high deposition
rates. Initially, process parameters derived from radio
frequency energized depositions were applied to microwave
depositions; however, it has been found that plasma
conditions encountered in a microwave process differ from
those in radio frequency energized processes and hence
necessitate changes in the various process parameters.One important class of semiconductor materials
which are manufactured by plasma deposition processes are
the Group IV semiconductor alloys. Most typically these
materials comprise alloys of silicon and/or germanium
together with alloying, modifying and dopant elements, the
most typical of which are hydrogen, halogens and the Group
III and Group V elements. It has been found that Group IV
semiconductor alloys deposited in high rate microwave
processes
