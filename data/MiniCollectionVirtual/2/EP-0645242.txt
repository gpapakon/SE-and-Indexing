<ABSTRACT>
A method and a device are described for controlling the sheet feeding when starting up a sheet-processing printing machine having a vibrator inking unit in which the sheets are placed against front lays, their correct position is established and, when the position has been established as correct, the sheet feed is released in a specific setting of the machine. The intention is, in the case of a plurality of starting-up operations, to avoid the first sheet fed-in running into the printing machine in each case at different phases of the vibrator cycle. This is achieved according to the invention in that the first sheet is conveyed up to the feed line, the feeder is then switched off and the sheet feed is then only released again when the vibrator mechanism assumes a specific angular position.

Method for controlling the running in of a sheet on 
starting up a sheet treating printing press with a 

vibrator inking unit which has a vibrator driven 
with reduction, wherein the cycle of the vibrator 

takes place over more than one press rotation, and 
in which sheets are laid on to
p of a feeder table 
(3) against front lays, their laying up checked and 

with the position detected as correct the sheet run-in 
is released at a given angular position of the 

printing press (1), characterised in that sheets are 
fed over the feeder table (3) so long until a first 

sheet is detected as lying correctly against the 
front lays, that thereafter the sheet running in is 

locked and the feed of sheets over the feeder table 
(3) is stopped, and that the running in of a first 

sheet as well as the feeding of further sheets over 
the feeder table (3) is carried out with reference 

to a defined predetermined angular position of the 
vibrator drive. 
Process according to Claim 1, characterised in that 
the angular position of the printing press (1) and 

from this also the angular position of the vibrator 
drive is determined in digital form. 
Process according to Claim 1, characterised in that 
the angular position of the vibrator drive is 

detected by means of a sensor. 
Device for carrying out the method according to 
Claim 1 in a printing press (1) with vibrator inking 

unit, wherein this has a vibrator driven with 
reduction, whereby the cycle of the vibrator occurs 

over more than one machine rotation, with a feeder 
(2) driveable from the main drive of the printing  

 
press (1) via a clutch (6), by means of which sheets 

can be fed over a feeder table (3) to front lays, as 
well as a control (10) which is operatively 

connected with sensors (4) installed in the region 
of the front lays and by means of which the clutch 

(6) of the feeder (2) as well as a pre-gripper 
effecting the sheet run-in is controllable, 

characterised in that by means of the control (10), 
the running in of a first sheet into the sheet 

offset printing press (1) can be freed by switching 
the clutch (6) as well as the pre-gripper (7) 

synchronised to a predetermined angular position of 
the vibrator drive. 
Device according to Claim 4, characterised in that 
the sheet offset printing press (1) has an angular 

sensor (9) by means of which the phase of the 
vibrator drive can be determined in the control 

(10). 
Device according to Claim 4, characterised in that a 
sensor which is operatively connected to the control 

(10) is installed on the vibrator drive.
