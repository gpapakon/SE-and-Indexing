<ABSTRACT>
Direct-positive photographic elements are 
comprised of a support and a silver halide emulsion 

layer containing core-shell silver halide grains 
comprising a chemically sensitized core and a 

chemically sensitized shell, wherein at least one of 
the core and the shell comprises a band of dopant and 

wherein the dopant is hexacyano ruthenium (II). 
Preferably, the shell of the core-shell grains is 

chemically sensitized with both a gold-containing 
chemical sensitizing agent and a sulfur-containing 

chemical sensitizing agent and the weight ratio of the 
gold-containing chemical sensitizing agent to the 

sulfur-containing chemical sensitizing agent is at 
least about two to one.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates in general to
photography and in particular to direct-positive
photographic elements. More specifically, this
invention relates to high-speed direct-positive
photographic elements containing doped core-shell
silver halide grains.Photographic elements which produce images
having an optical density directly related to the
radiation received on exposure are said to be negative-working.
A positive photographic image can be formed
by producing a negative photographic image and then
forming a second photographic image which is a negative
of the first negative--that is, a positive image. A
direct-positive image is understood in photography to
be a positive image that is formed without first
forming a negative image. Direct-positive photography
is advantageous in providing a more straight-forward
approach to obtaining positive photographic images.A conventional approach to forming direct-positive
images is to use photographic elements
employing internal latent image-forming silver halide
grains. After imagewise exposure, the silver halide
grains are developed with a surface developer--that is,
one which will leave the latent image sites within the
silver halide grains substantially unrevealed.
Simultaneously, either by uniform light exposure or by
the use of a nucleating agent, the silver halide grains
are subjected to development conditions that would
cause fogging of a negative-working photographic
element. The internal latent image-forming silver
halide grains which received actinic radiation during 
imagewise exposure develop under these conditions at a
slow rate as compared to the internal latent image-forming
silver halide grains not imagewise exposed.
The result is a direct-positive silver image. In color
photography, the oxidized developer that is produced
during silver development is used to produce a
corresponding direct-positive dye image. Multi-color
direct-positive photographic images have been
extensively investigated in connection with image
transfer photography.Direct-positive internal latent image-forming
emulsions can take the form of halide-conversion type
emulsions. Such emulsions are illustrated by Knott et
al U.S. Patent No. 2,456,943 and Davey et al U.S.
Patent No. 2,592,250.More recently the art has found it
advantageous to employ core-shell emulsions as direct-positive
internal latent image-forming emulsions. An
early teaching of core-shell emulsions is provided by
Porter et al U.S. Patent No. 3,206,313, wherein a
coarse grain monodispersed chemically sensitized
