<ABSTRACT>
Mechanical compressor (1) in which a suction line (2) is connected to a first connection port (11), and a discharge line (3, 5) is connected to a second connection port (12), an aftercooling (secondary cooling) unit (7) being provided which consists of two separate chambers (71, 72) with at least one partition and which, with its first chamber (71), is connected into the suction line (2) and, with its second chamber (72), is connected into the discharge line (3, 5), at least one injection line (9) for the purpose of injecting liquid debouching into the suction line (2) upstream of the aftercooling unit (7) and/or in the aftercooling unit (7). With a mechanical compressor of such a design it is possible to cool the gaseous flow medium to process-compatible temperatures without major additional fitting costs and with low energy demand.

Compressor system having a mechanical 
compressor, which has a first connection opening (11) 

and a second connection opening (12), with a suction 
line (2) being connected to the first connection 

opening (11), and a pressure line (3; 5) being 
connected to the second connection opening (12), in 

which system liquid is furthermore injected into the 
suction line (2) by means of an injection line (9), and 

provided in the course of the pressure line (3; 5) is 
an after-cooler unit (7) which in terms of flow is 

arranged downstream of the compressor, characterised 

in that the after-cooler unit (7) consists of 
two separate chambers (71; 72) having at least one 

dividing wall, with the first chamber (71) being 
connected in series with the suction line (2) and the 

second chamber (72) being connected in series with the 
pressure line (3; 5), and 
in that furthermore the injection line (9) opens 
out into the suction line upstream of the after-cooler 

unit (7) in terms of flow and/or inside the after-cooler 
unit (7). 
Compressor system according to claim 1, having 
a mechanical compressor which is constructed as a 

liquid ring machine, characterised by the following 
features: 


the pressure line comprises a connection line 
(3), by which a liquid separator (4) is connected to 

the second connection opening (12) of the liquid ring 
machine (1), as well as at least one exhaust air line 

which leads out of the liquid separator (4); 
the liquid separator (4) has at least one return 
line (6) which leads back to the liquid ring machine 

(1); 
the second chamber (72) of the after-cooler unit 
(7) is connected into the exhaust air line (5);  

 
the condensate can be returned from the second 
chamber (72) of the after-cooler unit (7) into the 

operating liquid circuit and/or into the passage of the 
gas. 
Compressor system according to claim 2, 
characterised in that a heat exchanger (10) is 

connected into the return line (6). 
Compressor system according to claim 2, 
characterised in that the injection line (9) branches 

off from the return line (6) between heat exchanger 
(10) and liquid ring machine (1). 
Compressor system according to claim 2, 
characterised in that the heat exchanger (10) is 

constructed as an air cooler. 
Compressor system according to claim 2, 
characterised in that the condensate return takes place 

by way of a condensate line (8), which branches off 
from the end (51) of the exhaust air line (5) that 

leads out of the after-cooler unit (7).
