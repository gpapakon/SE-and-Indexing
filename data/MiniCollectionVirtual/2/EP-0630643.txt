<ABSTRACT>
A free-flowing powder bleaching agent or dyeing agent for human hair with improved use properties, in particular freedom from dust and good stirrability with water and aqueous hydrogen peroxide solution, is obtained by applying about 5 to about 30% by weight of at least one wax or wax-like substance with a pour point between about 40 and about 130 DEG C, in particular a C12-C18-fatty acid alkanolamide, to a powder containing at least one solid compound with a bleaching action or at least one direct hair dye, preferably in a melt-on or spray-on process.

for bleaching of human hair according to one or more of the 

claims 1 to 6, characterized in that a wax compound having 
a flow point between 50°C and 130°C is sprayed onto a 

powder comprising at least one solid active bleaching compound, 
at a temperature between 50°C and 130°C. 
Process for the preparation of a pulverulent composition 
for bleaching or dyeing of human hair according to one or 

more of the claims 1 to 6, characterized in that at least 
one active bleaching compound is mixed with a wax compound 

having a flow point between 50°C and 130°C, and melted 
thereafter at a temperature exceeding the flow point of the 

wax compound, whereafter the mixture is cooled down.  
 
Pulverulent composition for dyeing and bleaching of human 
hair, containing at least one solid active bleaching compound 

or at least one solid direct dyestuff, characterized 
in that it contains 5% to 30% by wt., calculated to the
