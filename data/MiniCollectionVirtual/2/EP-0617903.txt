<ABSTRACT>
Innerboot particularly usable for skates including a 
first half-shell (2) and a second separate half-shell (3) 

that can be mutually coupled. The first and the second half-shells 
have flaps (7,8,11) that partially surround the other 

half-shell, so as to allow to obtain an innerboot usable 
both for front-entry shoe and for rear-entry shoe, with an 

increase in thickness in the areas subjected to a more 
intense pressure.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an innerboot 
particularly usable for skates. It is currently known to manufacture sports shoes, such 
as for example roller or ice skates or ski boots, which 
comprise a shell and one or more quarters articulated 
thereto. These components are usually made of rigid material, so 
that it is necessary to use an innerboot made of soft 
material to improve the fit of the foot. Innerboots obtained with conventional methods or by 
foaming, used particularly in ski boots, can currently be 
generally divided into complete innerboots for front-entry 
boots and partial innerboots for rear-entry boots. More in detail, the complete innerboot has, in its 
front part, so that it can be put on, a longitudinal opening 
which is covered by a large tongue fixed at the tip of the 
innerboot. This embodiment allows the tongue to move laterally 
with respect to the tibia and the foot instep and produces 
uncomfortable bulges of material especially in the region 
where the tongue overlaps the upper. This innerboot is also 
uncomfortable in the tibial region and in the metatarsal 
region. The partial innerboot is constituted by an innerboot 
that only surrounds the front part of the foot and of the 
leg, leaving exposed the ankle and heel regions as well as 
the rear part of the leg. The regions left exposed by the innerboot are protected 
and contained by paddings applied to the rear quarter that  
 
constitutes the boot. In this embodiment, unpleasant bulges of material form 
in the region where the padding overlaps the innerboot, 
producing pressure points in the ankle and calf regions. Furthermore, as can be easily understood, these 
different innerboots are considerably expensive from the 
point of view of standardization, since it is necessary to 
produce different parts to constitute a complete or partial 
innerboot; various processing steps are furthermore required 
to stitch the padding at the edges on the quarters of the 
boot. As a partial solution to these drawbacks, this same 
Applicant filed, on 19 May, 1981, an Italian Utility Model 
application no. 21814 B/81, which discloses an innerboot 
particularly for ski boots comprising a body which affects 
the region of the foot and from which a quarter extends. The 
main feature of this innerboot resides in the fact that a 
longitudinal notch is present on the quarter and is 
delimited by a pair of mutually superimposable flaps. Although this solution is undoubtedly valid, it has the 
drawback that it can be provided specifically for

<CLAIMS>
Innerboot particularly for skates, characterized in 
that it comprises a first half-shell (2) and a second 

separate half-shell (3) which can be mutually coupled and 
have flaps (7,8,11) partially surrounding said other half-shell. 
Innerboot according to claim 1, characterized in 
that said first and second half-shells have a half-sole 

(4a,4b) from which a half-body (5a,5b) extends and surrounds 
the lateral region of the foot, around approximately half of 

the foot instep and metatarsal regions, fully around the 
malleolar region (6a,6b) and around approximately half of 

the tibial region. 
Innerboot according to claim 2, characterized in 
that each one of said first and second half-shells has said 

flaps protruding from said half-bodies toward the other 
half-shell. 
Innerboot according to claim 3, characterized in 
that said first half-shell has a first (7) and a second (8) 

flap protruding respectively at the foot instep region and 
at the rear ankle and/or tibial (10) region. 
Innerboot according to claim 3, characterized in 
that said second half-shell has a third flap (11) protruding 

at the front region (10) of the tibia. 
Innerboot according to claim 5, characterized in 
that said first, second and third flaps partially surround 

the other one of said first and second half-shells. 
Innerboot according to one or more of the preceding 
claims, characterized in that it comprises a sole (12)  

 
having means (13) for connection to said first and second 

separate half-shells. 
Innerboot according to claim 7, characterized in 
that said means are constituted by mushroom-shaped lugs (13) 

the head whereof is associable in a snap-together manner in 
adapted holes formed on said half-soles.
