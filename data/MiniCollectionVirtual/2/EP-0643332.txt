<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a process for the production of a coloured picture (image, print), in particular a colour proofing method for multicolour printing, in which a photosensitive material comprising     (A) a transparent base film, (B) a coloured photosensitive layer containing an organic binder (B1), a dye or coloured pigment (B2), a compound (B3) which forms a strong acid on irradiation, and a compound (B4) which contains at least one acid-cleavable group, and (C) an adhesive layer which contains a thermoplastic polymer and has a softening point in the range from 40 to 200 DEG C, is laminated under pressure and at elevated temperature to an image-receiving sheet (D) by means of the adhesive layer (C), the resultant laminate is exposed imagewise through the base film (A), and the base film together with the unexposed areas of the photosensitive layer (B) are peeled off from the image-receiving sheet (D), where the adhesion (a1) of the unexposed photosensitive layer (B) to the adhesive layer (C) is less than the adhesion (a2) of the adhesive layer (C) to the image-receiving sheet (D), and the adhesion (a3) of the unexposed photosensitive layer (B) to the base film (A) and than the cohesions of layers (B) and (C), and where the adhesion (a3') of the exposed photosensitive layer (B) to the base film (A) is less than the adhesion (a2) of the adhesive layer (C) to the image-receiving sheet (B) and the adhesion (a1') of the exposed photosensitive layer (B) to the adhesive layer (C) and than the cohesions of the adhesive layer (C) and the exposed photosensitive layer (B). The process gives pictures of high resolution.

an organic binder (B1) and a dye or a coloured 

pigment (B2), and 
(C) an adhesive layer which contains a thermoplastic 
polymer and has a softening temperature within 

the range of from 40 to 200°C, 
 
with the adhesion (a
1

to the adhesive layer (C) and than the mutual cohesion 

of the adhesive layer (C) and of the exposed light-sensitive 
layer (B), characterised in that the 

coloured light-sensitive layer (B) contains in 
addition a compound (B3), which on exposure to light 

forms a strong acid, and a compound (B4) possessing at 
least one group which can be split by acid.

orthocarboxylic ester, an acetal or ketal. 
The light-sensitive material according to claim 1, 
characterised in that the surface of the transparent 

supporting film (A), whereon the light-sensitive layer 
(B) is situated, is pretreated in order to prevent 

blocking.
