<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates generally to the
field of seismic exploration, and more particularly to
a hydraulic actuator for a seismic vibrator.Typically, seismic exploration involves imparting
shock waves, or vibrations, into geologic formations
and monitoring the reflected portion of shock waves
passing through differing strata in the formations.
The reflected shock waves are used to estimate the
depth, shape and composition of differing strata within
a formation. Hydraulic actuators are used extensively
to generate the shock waves, or vibrations, used in
seismic exploration.Because the world's known supply of hydrocarbonbased
fuel continues to dwindle, seismic exploration is
pursued in increasingly remote areas thought to contain
untapped hydrocarbon deposits. The equipment used to
conduct seismic exploration in these remote areas must
be dependable and versatile. Further, any problems or
breakages experienced by this equipment should be
serviceable in the field. Unfortunately, present day
seismic vibrators suffer from limited versatility and
limited field serviceability.Seismic energy (or shock waves) necessary for
seismic exploration is commonly generated in a
controlled sweep of frequencies - typically varying
from around 10 Hz to 120 Hz. Four to six seismic
vibrators may be used for two-dimensional surveys and
eight to twelve seismic vibrators may be used for
three-dimensional surveys. Seismic energy is imparted
to the formation through a base plate attached to the
lower end of a vertically disposed, dual acting
hydraulic actuator. The force creating the seismic
shock wave is generated by hydraulic pressure reacting
against the actuator piston and a substantial mass (or
mass block). The mass block typically weights from two 
thousand seven hundred to three thousand six hundred
kilograms (six to eight thousand pounds) and most often
forms the body of the hydraulic actuator.The rigors of seismic exploration often result in
mechanical failures. For example, piston rings are
known to fail. If a piston ring breaks in a present
day seismic vibrator, the piston bore wall is often
irreparably damaged. Some prior art hydraulic
actuators used as vibrators contain piston bore liners;
others do not. If the vibrator has no piston bore
liner, the seismic vibrator must be removed from the
exploration field to a facility capable of machining
the damaged area from the mass block bore.
Furthermore, the mass block bore must typically be
further expanded, by mechanical removal of mass block
material, to
