<ABSTRACT>
The present invention provides a center-aligning 
apparatus for fusiform bread dough pieces such as rolled-up 

croissant dough pieces (1), including an upstream 
conveyor (2), and a downstream conveyor (3) located below 

and adjacent the upstream conveyor. Between the two 
conveyors (2, 3) and adjacent the upstream conveyor, a 

pair of concave rollers (4, 4') is arranged. The rolled-up 
dough piece (1) from the upstream conveyor (2) is 

deposited on the concave rollers (4, 4') as they rotate, 
which causes the center of the dough piece to be aligned 

with the central or widest portion of a gap (G) between 
the rollers. Also, a pair of shutters (5, 5') is mounted 

below the concave rollers to receive the dough piece 
from the rollers and to stably deposit the dough piece on 

the downstream conveyor (3). This apparatus enables the 
dough piece to advance in alignment with the central 

line of the downstream conveyor (3).

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to the art of center-aligning
fusiform bread dough pieces, such as rolled-up croissant
dough pieces. It has been difficult to align croissant
dough pieces with the conveyor or a folding device while
the dough pieces are being conveyed, since the central
portion of the dough piece is thicker than the remaining
portions. The object of this invention is to provide a
center-aligning apparatus located in an upstream zone of
an apparatus for folding the croissant dough pieces.Conventional croissants are generally bent or curved
at their central portions, and to obtain products of such
a shape many forming apparatuses have been developed in
the past, such as are shown in Netherlands Patent
Application No. 8800402 and German Patent Application No.
P4039793.9.According to the prior art, it is not easy to bend
the croissant dough piece at its center. To do so, a
preceding or preliminary operation is required. The
present invention provides a center-aligning apparatus
for the croissant dough piece in preparation for the
bending thereof.The apparatus according to the present invention
enables the center of the croissant dough piece to be
correctly aligned with the subsequent bending device
while the dough is being conveyed on a conveyor.From one aspect, this invention provides a center-aligning
apparatus for croissant dough pieces comprising
a pair of concave rollers located between an upstream
conveyor that conveys rolled-up croissant dough pieces
and a downstream conveyor positioned below and downstream
of the upstream conveyor, the rollers being rotatable in
the same direction as that of the movement of the
upstream conveyor, and being provided with a gap between
the pair of rollers which is adjustable so that it can be
widened or narrowed.From another aspect, the present invention provides 
center-aligning apparatus for croissant dough pieces
comprising a pair of concave rollers located between an
upstream conveyor that conveys rolled-up croissant dough
pieces and a downstream conveyor positioned below and
downstream of the upstream conveyor, the rollers being
rotatable in the same direction as that of the movement
of the upstream conveyor, the rollers being provided with
a gap therebetween.The gap between the rollers may be adjustable.The apparatus may further comprises a pair of planar
shutters below and adjacent the pair of concave rollers,
and adapted to be opened and closed, the free
longitudinal edge of each of the shutters being inclined
downwardly and inwardly when the shutters

<CLAIMS>
A center-aligning apparatus for croissant dough
pieces,characterised by a pair of concave rollers (4,

4') located between an upstream conveyor (2) that conveys
rolled-up croissant dough pieces (1) and a downstream

conveyor (3) positioned below and downstream of the
upstream conveyor (2), the rollers (4, 4') being provided

with a gap (G) therebetween and being rotatable in the
same direction as that of the movement of the upstream

conveyor (2).
An apparatus according to claim 1, wherein the gap
(G) between the 
pair of rollers (4, 4') is adjustable.
An apparatus according to claim 1 or 2, further
comprising a pair of spaced-apart planar shutters (5, 5')

below and adjacent the pair of concave rollers (4, 4')
and adapted to be opened and closed, the free

longitudinal edge (53) of each of the shutters being
inclined downwardly and inwardly when the shutters are

closed.
An apparatus according to claim 3, wherein the free
longitudinal edge (53) of each of the shutters (5, 5')

has a cut-out (54) at its central portion.
An apparatus according to claim 3 or 4, , wherein
a sensor (21) is provided adjacent the downstream end of

the upstream conveyor (2) to detect the approaching dough
pieces (1) and to send signals so as to open or close the

shutters (5, 5').
An apparatus according to any preceding claim,
wherein a sensor (21) is provided adjacent the downstream

end of the upstream conveyor (2) to detect the passage of
the croissant dough pieces (1) on the upstream conveyor,

the sensor being adapted to provide signals, and the gap
between the concave rollers (4, 4') being widened or

narrowed based on the signals from the sensor.
