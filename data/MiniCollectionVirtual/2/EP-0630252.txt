<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a pharmaceutical preparation comprising as an active ingredient at least one rhamnolipid or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof, and a carrier and/or diluent, preferably comprising a rhamnolipid of general formula (I), wherein R1 = H, alpha-L-rhamnopyranosyl; R2 = H, (a); R3 = (C5-C20)-saturated, -mono- of poly-unsaturated alkyl; R4 = (C5-C20)-saturated, -mono- of poly-unsaturated alkyl. The preparation is used for the treatment of dermatological diseases, e.g. Papilloma virus infections.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a pharmaceutical
preparation comprising as an active ingredient at least one
rhamnolipid. In particular, the present invention relates to
such a pharmaceutical preparation for treatment of
dermatological diseases.Among bio-surfactants are glycolipids. Due to different
combinations of carbohydrates and lipids, together with
structural different bonds and different ionic states, there
are variety of glycolipids having mutually a strongly
different hydrophilic/lipophilic balance. It is known that
various strains of Pseudomonas, such as Pseudomonas
aaeruginosa, Pseudomonas fluorescens, Pseudomonas putida,
Pseudomonas oleovorans are capable of extra cellular
secretion of rhamnolipids, when growing on soluble and
insoluble carbon sources.Patent abstracts of JAPAN, vol. 13, no. 61 10

Rhamnolipids in the treatment of inflammatory diseases
when administered orally or parenterally.FAT. SCI. TECHNOL. vol 91, no. 9, 1989, pages
363-366, S. Lang et al: "Antimicrobial Effects of
Biosurfactants" teaches that Rhamnolipids possess
antimicrobial properties, specifically that they prevent
the growth of Gram-positive bacteria.J. of antibiotics 1971. vol. 24, no. 12, 1971,
pages 855-859 S Itoh et al. teaches that Rhamnolipids may
exhibit varying biological activities in vitro.Current Microbiol. vol. 10. no. 6, 1984, pages

Epidermolysis bullosa hereditaria simplex and the like.Preferably, the rhamnolipid is a rhamnolipid of the
general formula
Very active rhamnolipids are obtained when the
rhamnolipid is a di-rhamnolipid.When the substituent R2 is hydrogen, the rhamnolipid
comprises only one lipid group. When the substituent R2 is
formed by the group

the rhamnolipid molecule comprises two lipid units mutually
connected by an ester bond.The substituents R3 and R4 may be selected from
straight or branched (C5-C20)-saturated mono or poly-unsaturated
alkyl groups. Preferred are unbranched,
