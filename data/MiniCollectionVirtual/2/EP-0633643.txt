<ABSTRACT>
An electrical machine having a horizontal shaft and a laminated stator body (1) which is arranged in a horizontally divided housing (2, 3) and is clamped by means of fastening wedges (35), which are distributed over its circumference, in supporting rings (32) which are arranged orthogonally with respect to the machine longitudinal axis and are at a distance from one another. The supporting rings are connected, on their outer circumference, via fastening parts (39, 40) to the housing lower part (2) of the machine. The supporting rings (32) have azimuthal fastening plates, which run symmetrically with respect to the vertical plane of symmetry of the machine. In order to decouple the laminated stator body (1) from the housing lower part (2), the fastening plates (40) are fastened on the said supporting rings horizontally in the radial direction, in a sprung manner, the fastening plate (40) itself being constructed as a leaf spring, or acting as such.

Horizontal-axis electrical machine having a 
stator laminate core (1) which is arranged in a housing 

(2, 3) which is split horizontally and is stiffened by 
housing formers (21-25, 49), which stator laminate core 

is clamped by means of fastening wedges (35), which are 
distributed over on [sic]
 its circumference, in 
supporting rings (32), which are arranged orthogonally 

to the machine longitudinal axis, are spaced apart from 
one another and are connected such that they are sprung 

in the radial direction, on their external 
circumference, via fastening parts, to the housing 

lower part (2) of the machine, the fastening parts 
comprising azimuthal fastening plates (40) which run 

symmetrically with respect to the vertical plane of 
symmetry of the machine, characterized in that the 

fastening plates (40) are fastened to the said 
supporting rings (32) such that they are sprung 

horizontally in the radial direction, the fastening 
plate (40) itself being constructed as a leaf spring, 

or acting as such, and in that a plate (39) is provided 
between the fastening plate (40) and the supporting 

ring (32), which plate runs parallel to the fastening 
plate (40), is firmly connected to the supporting ring 

(32) and, in its central section, leaves a gap (41) 
free between itself and the fastening plate (40). 
Machine according to Claim 1, characterized in 
that the fastening plate (40) is firmly connected to 

the supporting ring (32) only at its upper end and 
lower end, in such a manner that a gap (41a) remains 

free between the supporting ring (32) and the central 
section of the fastening plate. 
Machine according to either of Claims 1 or 2, 
characterized in that the housing formers (21, ..., 25) 

are stiffened, at least in the housing lower part (2), 
by reinforcing elements (50, 51) on which housing bolts 

(54) engage from the housing upper part (3).  
 
Machine according to Claim 3, characterized in 
that the housing bolts (54) are guided through 

vertically running tubes (52) which are arranged in the 
housing upper part (3) and extend as far as the 

horizontal separating point (53) of the housing. 
Machine according to one of Claims 1 to 4, 
characterized in that at least the two outer supporting 

rings (32) are connected to the housing lower part (2) 
via horizontally running thrust plates (56, 57), 

underneath the stator laminate core (1) and 
symmetrically with respect to the vertical plane of 

symmetry (5) of the machine.
