<ABSTRACT>
The method for determining a reproduction position of a disc player in a 
reproduction device which reproduces information recorded on a recording 

medium through movement of a reproduction unit, includes a first step for 
identifying a piece number of music which was being reproduced of the 

time of power off and a position of a reproduction unit at the time of 
power off when power is turned on after turned off during reproduction of 

the piece of music recorded on a recording medium, and a second step 
for moving the reproduction unit to a beginning position of the piece of 

music which was being reproduced at the time of power off and 
performing normal reproduction, and the method for determining 

reproduction position of a record player in a reproduction device having a 
reproduction unit fixed and a recording medium moving for reproducing 

information recorded thereon, includes a first step for, when during the 
reproduction of a music recorded on a recording medium power is turned 

off and then turned on, detecting existence of information of music from a 
part the reproduction unit is happened to match with at the time of turn 

on of pieces of music recorded on a recording medium, and a second step 
for finding non-existence of signal of music from the part the reproduction 

unit is happened to match with the recording medium at the time of 
turn-on and performing reproduction from the beginning of the piece of 

music having been reproduced at the time of turn-off.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to an audio device, more particularly to a method
for determining reproduction position of a reproduction device such as a
record player or a cassette player for an automobile, with which an
audio device can be started reproduction from the beginning of a piece
of music through detection of the beginning of the piece of music
interrupted at the time of power off of the device, in case when the
device is started during driving of the automobile after power off of the
device at the time of stopping of operation of the automobile.Shown in FIG.1 is a block diagram of a conventional record player, based
on which a conventional art is to be explained hereinafter.A conventional record player has a manipulation part 1 for selecting keys
necessary to listen to a piece of music, a microprocessor 2, a memory part
3, a loading mechanism part 4 and a circuit part 5.The microprocessor 2 controls, during power is turned on, overall operation 
of a record player, such as processing key signals received from the
manipulation part 1, and controlling of record loading and driving a
reproduction unit in response to the processed signals, or controlling the
number of revolutions of a disc etc., and detects the positions of the piece
of music of which reproduction was interrupted and reproduction unit at
the time of turn-off when power is turn-off during operation of the record
player, and transmits the information.The memory part 3 has memory elements 3a such as non-volatile memory
elements or memory elements using backup power, connected to the
microprocessor 2, for storing position information of the reproduction unit
and piece number of the music at the time of interruption of reproduction
sensed by the microprocessor 2 when power is turned-off.The loading mechanism part 4 has a record sensing switch SW1, a
turntable(not shown) and a reproduction unit(not shown), recieves driving
signals from the microprocessor 2 and rotates a record disc in response to
the driving signals to reproduce the piece of music recorded on the disc. The circuit part 5 connected to the microprocessor 2 and loading
mechanism part 4, respectively and applies power thereon.The conventional record player having foregoing circuit can reproduce
pieces of music recorded on a record disc by putting in power to the
record player causing to load a record disc on the loading mechanism
part 4 and subsequent turn-on of the record sensing switch SW1, rotation of
the record disc, and operation of the reproduction unit.In this instant,
</DESCRIPTION>
<CLAIMS>
A method for detecting the reproduction position of a cassette player having a
fixed reproduction unit and a moving recording medium for reproducing music

information recorded thereon, wherein the music information includes a plurality of
pieces of music, the method comprising the steps of :


detecting, when the reproduction of music recorded on the recording medium is
turned off and then turned on, whether music information exists on the recording

medium at the point where the fixed reproduction unit was reproducing at the time of
turn off;
searching the recording medium in the rewind direction to locate a non-music information portion that
exists between an end of a previous musical piece and a beginning of the actual musical piece if

the detecting step determines that music information exists on the recording medium at
the point of turn off ; and
restarting reproduction from the beginning of the piece of music being
reproduced at the time of turn off by starting reproduction from the located portion.
The method as claimed in claim 1, wherein the step of detecting existence of
music information in the first step is carried out in the fast forward direction.
The method as claimed in claim 1, wherein the step of detecting existence of
music information in the first step is carried out in the rewind direction.
