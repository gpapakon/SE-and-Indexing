<ABSTRACT>
A welding device, in particular an inert-gas welding device, with a base unit (1) which contains, among other things, a wire-feed device (15) and can be connected to a welding torch (2) via a hose assembly (3) which can be attached to a central connection (6) passing through a wall recess of the housing (4) of the base unit (1) and insulated from the latter. In this welding device, an adjustment of the central connection (6) can be avoided by the central connection (6) and the wire-feed device (15) being connected in a mutually fixed manner to form a construction unit which can be flange-mounted on the housing (4) of the base unit (1) by means of a fastening flange (8) provided on the central-connection side and with an insulating device (27) inbetween.

Welding device, in particular inert gas shielded welding 
device, with a base tool (1) incorporating a wire feed 

device (15) and connectable to a welding torch (2) via a 
flexible tube assembly (3) connectable to a central connection 

(6) extending through a wall recess of the housing 
(4) of the base tool (1) and insulated therefrom, characterized 

in that the central connection (6) and the wire feed 
device (15) are fixed relative to each other to form a 

module which can be flange-mounted to the housing (4) of 
the base tool (1) by means of a mounting flange (8) provided 

at the central connection with the insertion of an 
insulating device (27). 
Welding device according to Claim 1, characterized in that 
the mounting flange (8) supporting the central connection 

(6) is immovably attached to an end plate (16) housing the 
wire feed device (15). 
Welding device according to Claim 1, characterized in that 
the mounting flange (8), the central connection (6) and the 

end plate (16) housing the wire feed device (15) are designed 
as a single part. 
Welding device according to any of the preceding claims, 
characterized in that the mounting flange (8) is flange-mounted 

to the housing (4) from the inside of the housing. 
Welding device according to any of the preceding claims, 
characterized in that the insulating device (27) has an 

insulating bush (28) encompassing a coupling spigot (7) of 
the central connection (6) extending through the wall  

 
recess of the housing (4), from which insulating bush projects 

an insulating flange (29) contacting the mounting 
flange (8) and the adjacent housing wall, and in that the 

flange bolts (26) are insulated from the housing (4). 
Welding device according to Claim 5, characterized in that 
an insulating bush (30) with an external locating flange is 

installed in each hole provided in the housing (4) for the 
flange bolts (26).
