<ABSTRACT>
A connector includes flexible hinge pieces molded 
of a synthetic resin, wherein each flexible hinge piece is 

caused to upwardly extend. When each side plate of a 
retainer is squeezed from above toward the rear end side 

of a recessed part formed on one side surface of a 
connector housing, a provisional engagement locking 

protuberance is fitted into the fore end side of an 
elongated hole, causing the fore edge of the side plate to 

be held between the provisional engagement locking 
protuberance and a normal engagement locking protuberance 

in the clamped state. The retainer is thus held in the 
provisionally engaged state. At this time, the hinge 

piece is folded in the connector housing, and the retainer 
is located at a position where each terminal piece can be 

inserted into and drawn from the corresponding terminal 
insert hole. When the retainer is further squeezed from 

above after the terminal piece is inserted into the 
terminal insert hole, a normal engagement locking 

protuberance is fitted into the fore end side of the 
elongated hole, causing the provisional engagement locking 

protuberance and the normal engagement locking 
protuberance to be engaged with the opposite ends of the 

elongated hole. The retainer is thus held in the normally 
engaged state. This structure assures that provisional 

engagement is established, wherein each flexible hinge 
piece is folded to the connector housing side while 

preventing the hinge piece from being broken or cut in 
pieces.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a connector, and more
particularly to a connector of the type including a retainer
which is connectable to a connector housing for
holding terminals inserted therein.EP-A-0 477 610 shows a known connector of the type including
a connector housing having a plurality of terminal
inserting holes so as to enable a plurality of terminal
pieces to be inserted into the terminal inserting holes.
The terminal pieces are locked inside the connector housing
by means of a common shifting piece which in one position
allows insertion of the terminal pieces into the respective
inserting holes and in an other position locks all terminal
pieces in common.An other known connector is of the type including a
plurality of retainers so as to exhibit a function of double
engagement with a connector housing and is constructed
such that also a plurality of terminal inserting holes are
formed in the connector housing so as to enable a plurality
of terminal pieces to be inserted into the terminal inserting
holes. The retainers are elastically connected to the
connector housing via a plurality of flexible hinges. Primary
engagement is established while the terminal pieces
are inserted into the terminal insert holes with the aid of
a plurality of elastic engagement pieces, with a possibility
that the terminal pieces are disconnected from the connector
housing. Secondary engagement is established by
bringing a part of each retainer in the corresponding terminal
inserting hole while the hinge pieces are folded and
the retainers are firmly engaged with the connector housing.The known connector constructed in this manner is
called a hinge type. In contrast to other types of conventional
connectors including a plurality of retainers independently
of a connector housing, the hinge type connector 
has an advantage that storage of connectors can easily be
controlled because each connector only includes one component.However, since each hinge piece is exposed to the outside
while extending outside of the connector housing before
the retainers are brought in engagement with the connector
housing, e.g., in the case that an assembling operation
is performed while primary engagement is established
by inserting the terminal pieces into the terminal inserting
holes formed in the connector housing, each hinge piece
may come in contact with other articles during transportation
of connectors or during each practical connecting operation.
Due to a low strength of each hinge piece itself,
there sometimes arises a

<CLAIMS>
A connector including:

a connector housing (1) having a plurality of terminal
insert holes (3) formed therein for receiving a plurality

of terminal pieces (2); and
a retainer (7) which is connectable to said connector
housing (1), wherein
a primary engagement position between said terminal
insert holes (3) and said terminal pieces (2) is established

after said terminal pieces (2) are inserted into
said terminal insert holes (3) with the aid of a plurality

of elastic engagement pieces (5) being associated to said
connector housing (1) and being engageable with said terminal

pieces (2), said terminal pieces (2) thus being disconnectable
from said connector housing (1) in said primary

engagement position, and wherein
a secondary, normally engagement position between said
terminal insert holes (3) and said terminal pieces (2) is

established when a part of said retainer (7) is inserted in
a corresponding one of said terminal insert holes (3) while

said retainer (7) is firmly engaged with said connector
housing (1), said connector further comprising
holding means for holding said retainer (7) in engagement
with said connector housing (1) in said primary and

secondary engagement positions, respectively, said holding
means are furthermore for holding said retainer (7) in a

provisional engagement position, said provisional engagement
position permitting said terminal pieces (2) to be inserted

into said terminal insert holes (3) before establishing
said normally engagement position,

characterized in that

said retainer (7) is elastically connected to said
connector housing (1) via a flexible member (8); and 
said retainer having side plates (15) gradually increasing
in vertical width when seen in moving direction

from said primary to said secondary engagement position,
said side plates (15) running on inclined guide surfaces

(17) of said connector housing (1), so that upon movement

of said retainer (7) from said primary to said secondary
engagement position said retainer is slantwise downwardly

displaced in the forward direction along the guide surfaces
(17).
The connector according to claim 1, wherein said
retainer (7) has a first portion fixed to said connector

housing (1) via said flexible member (8) and said side
plates (15) engageable with said connector housing (1); and

said connector housing (1) has a recessed portion (16) for
receiving said side plates (15) of said retainer (7), said

recessed portion comprising an attachment mechanism for attaching
said retainer (7) to said connector housing in said

provisionally engaged position such that said plurality of
terminal pieces (2) is insertable into said plurality of
