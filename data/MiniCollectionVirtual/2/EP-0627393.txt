<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a process for 
producing a cyclopentenol derivative useful as an 
intermediate for the production of insecticides. A cyclopentenol compound represented by the 
formula I: 
wherein R₁ represents a 2-propenyl group or a 2-propynyl 
group is disclosed as a useful intermediate for the 
production of insecticides in Japanese Patent Kokai 56-156238 
and 55-147233. However, the yield of said 
compound by the disclosed process was not satisfactory, 
which process comprised Wittig reaction of a 
cyclopentenolone compound II: 
wherein R₁ is the same as defined above with a methyltriphenylphosphonium 
halide and a base. Hence an 
advantageous process which can provide said cyclopentenol 
compound I in good yields has been desired. The inventors conducted a study to overcome 
the drawbacks of the above-mentioned method, and found 
out an advantageous process for producing said 
cyclopentenol compound I in good yields from the 
cyclopentenolone compound II using a protecting group 
and a reagent system comprising (a) titanium 
tetrachloride, (b) zinc and (c) dibromomethane or 
diiodomethane. That is, one of the objects of the invention 
is to provide a process for the production of a 
cyclopentenol compound I: 
wherein R₁ represents a 2-propenyl group or a 2-propynyl 
group, which comprises the steps of; 
(i) protecting the hydroxyl group of the 
cyclopentenolone compound II:   
wherein R₁ is the same as defined above to give a 
cyclopentenolone derivative represented by the formula 
III: 
 
wherein R₁ is the same as defined above and A is a 
protecting group for a hydroxyl group; (ii) reacting a mixture of zinc and dibromomethane 
or diiodomethane in an inert organic solvent with 
titanium tetrachloride; (iii) reacting the resulting reaction mixture with 
the cyclopentenolone derivative III to give a 
cyclopentenol derivative IV: 
 
wherein R₁ and A are the same as defined above; and  (iv) removing the protecting group A from the 
cyclopentenol derivative IV to give the cyclopentenol 
compound I. Another object of the present invention is to 
provide a process for the production of a cyclopentenol 
derivative IV: 
wherein R₁ and A are the same as defined above, which 
comprises the steps of; 
(i) reacting a mixture of zinc and dibromomethane 
or diiodomethane in an inert organic solvent with 
titanium tetrachloride; and (ii) reacting the resulting reaction mixture with a 
cyclopentenolone derivative represented by the formula 
III: 
 
wherein R₁ and A are the same as defined above.
