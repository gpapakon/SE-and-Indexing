<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a digital recording and/or
reproducing apparatus using a recording medium. More particularly,
the present invention relates to such a digital recording and/or
reproducing apparatus having an interface circuit.An audio recording and/or reproducing apparatus using a
compact size magneto-optical disc has already been proposed by the
present assignee (e.g., EP-A-473305). In recording by the use of
this recording and/or reproducing apparatus, digital audio data is
compressed and the compressed digital data is recorded onto a
compact size magneto-optical disc having a diameter of 64 (mm), for
example. In reproducing by the use of this apparatus, the
compressed digital data is read out from the magneto-optical disc
and is once stored into a buffer memory. Then, the data is
sequentially read out from the buffer memory and is then expanded
to reproduce the original digital audio data.In this case, the magneto-optical disc has a recording
capacity of about 158 Mbytes and a maximum recording or reproducing 
time of about 74 (min).As this recording and/or reproducing apparatus uses the
compact size magneto-optical disc having a diameter of 64 (mm) as
a recording medium, the apparatus can be reduced in size and
weight, and accordingly it can be conveniently used as a portable
recording and/or reproducing apparatus. Further, as the recording
medium is in the form of a disc, the apparatus is excellent in
random accessibility in such a manner that a desired piece of music
can be instantaneously selected.In the above-mentioned recording and/or reproducing apparatus,
an audio signal is recorded or reproduced in the state of digital
data. Accordingly, this apparatus is considered to be used also
as an external storage for storing any digital data other than
digital audio data, such as computer programs, document data, and
image data. Thus, the recording and/or reproducing apparatus is
considered to be used not only as audio equipment but also as an
external storage for a computer or the like.The use of the recording and/or reproducing apparatus also as
an external storage brings about such a convenience that a user may
listen to the music with this apparatus in the way to an office and
may input data from this apparatus into a computer or gather data
into the apparatus in the office.However, in adding to the recording and/or reproducing
apparatus the function as the external storage for storing general
digital data excluding digital audio data, the apparatus must be
additionally provided
