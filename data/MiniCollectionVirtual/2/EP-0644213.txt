<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a process for the preparation of contact adhesive dispersions based on a copolymer CP built up from butyl acrylate and (meth)acrylic acid, in which the aqueous emulsion EM containing butyl acrylate and anionic and nonionic emulsifiers is polymerised in the aqueous phase with warming and in the presence of at least one water-soluble initiator IN of the formula (I
>
 M R1 (I
>
 in which M is a metal cation and R1 is the anion of a peroxo acid or of an azo-containing acid, in amounts of at least 0.5 to 1.5 % by weight, based on the monomers, the (meth)acrylic acid is then emulsified in with retention of the elevated temperature, and finally the final polymerisation is carried out with addition of a further initiator RI.

<CLAIMS>
A process for preparing adhesive dispersions based on
a copolymer CP synthesised from butyl acrylate and

(meth)acrylic acid, the weight ratio of the two monomers
being between 99.5 : 0.5 and above 85 : below 15,

characterised in that in an aqueous phase, under heating
and in the presence of at least one water-soluble

initiator IN of formula (I)

M R
1

wherein M represents a metal cation and R
1
 represents the
anion of a peroxoacid or an azo group-containing acid,

the initiator being present in amounts of at least 0.5
to 1.5 wt.% based on the monomers, the aqueous emulsion

EM containing butyl acrylate as well as anionic and non-ionic
emulsifiers is polymerised, then, whilst

maintaining the elevated temperature, the (meth)acrylic
acid is emulsified in, and, finally, while adding a

further initiator RI, the final polymerisation takes
place.
