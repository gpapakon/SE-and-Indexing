<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a coating for metals 
which improves the corrosion resistance and adhesion properties 
of the metal's surface. Specifically, the present invention 
relates to a single non-chromium treatment that is equally 
effective on many different metal surfaces. Such metals include 
aluminum, steel, zinc coated steel and zinc-aluminum coated 
steel. The purposes of conversion coatings on metal surfaces are 
to provide corrosion resistance and improve the adhesion of 
coatings. The conversion coating improves the adhesion of 
coating layers such as paints, inks, lacquers and plastics.  Traditionally, chromates have been utilized as conversion 
coating compounds. Chromates are known to exhibit acceptable 
performance on different types of metals or alloys, such as 
aluminum, steel, galvanized steel and zinc-aluminum coated 
steel. Chromate conversion coatings are typically administered 
by contacting the metal surface with an aqueous solution 
containing hexavalent or trivalent chromium ions, phosphate ions 
or fluoride ions. Serious concerns have been raised, however, 
regarding the pollution effects of the chromate or phosphate 
discharged into rivers or waterways by such processes. Due to 
the high solubility and the strongly oxidizing character of 
hexavalent chromium ions, conventional chromate conversion 
coating processes require extensive waste treatment procedures to 
control their discharge. While many acceptable chromium-free conversion coatings 
have been developed, their utility is often limited to only one 
type of metal substrate. Many industrial operations, however, 
involve the sequential processing of different types of metals. 
Unless the undesirable chromium compounds are used, the 
industrial metal processor is forced to change the conversion 
coating bath for each different type of metal. This results in 
unacceptable downtime and higher processing costs.  It is desirable, therefore, to have a conversion coating 
compound which is equally effective on more than one type of 
metal. This is achieved by the composition of the present 
invention. The present inventors have discovered a metal conversion 
coating which enhances the corrosion resistance and the adhesion 
properties of the surface of the metal. It provides excellent 
paint adhesion and corrosion resistance. The coating of the 
present invention is formed from an aqueous solution containing 
an anionic acrylamide:acrylic acid copolymer, water soluble inorganic 
silicate and an organofunctional silane. It
