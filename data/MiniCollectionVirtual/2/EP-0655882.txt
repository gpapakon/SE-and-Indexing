<ABSTRACT>
This disclosure pertains to an apparatus and 
method of providing EMI shielding for an electrical 

component. The apparatus includes an elastomeric 
gasket, which is provided with a conductive jacket, 

and which is mounted on the backplane of a cabinet, 
the backplane providing EMI shielding. The cabinet 

is adapted for the insertion of a plurality of 
electrical components, such as disk drives, tape 

drives, and power supplies, which themselves are 
housed in a rigid container. The container 

includes EMI shielding on five of the six sides, 
whereas the sixth side is unshielded. When the 

container is inserted in the cabinet in use, the 
backplane provides shielding for the sixth side of 

the container; the gasket serves the purpose of 
establishing an electrical connection between the 

container and the backplane of the cabinet.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to electromagnetic 
interference (EMI) shielding, and more particularly 
relates to providing improved EMI shielding through 
a device having shielding on five sides and a 
backplane with a shielding gasket. Modern computers are typically made up of a 
number of components which together form a complete 
computing system. For example, in addition to the 
central processing device and main memory, a given 
computer system may include separately housed tape 
drives, disk drives, or power supplies, with each 
such device being a separate and distinct 
component. Although such components are separate 
and distinct from one another, they are typically 
configured for modular insertion in a larger 
assembly, such as a structurally rigid frame, or 
cabinet. The cabinet thereby accommodates the easy 
insertion and removal of the individual devices for  
 
repair and replacement. To the extent that the system allows for the 
easy insertion and removal of modular devices, it 
is necessary to consider the necessary means by 
which the devices are shielded against EMI. Such 
EMI shielding is of particular concern when any one 
of the devices in the cabinet may be removed while 
other devices in the cabinet are still running. In 
other words, one particular concern is making sure 
that if any one of the devices is removed, while 
the others are still operating, the EMI shield for 
those devices still operating is not broken. One approach to creating individual shielding 
for modular circuit boards is disclosed in US 
Patent 4,868,716, issued to Taylor on 19 September 
1989. In particular, Taylor discloses enclosing 
modular circuit boards within a five-sided 
enclosure. According to Taylor, shielding for the 
sixth side is provided by the top grounding plane 
of a base circuit board, a gasket made of an 
elongated strip of spring metal material, and a 
socket assembly made of fence strips and a metal 
insert. Accordingly, the provision of shielding on 
the sixth side in the Taylor device involves the 
use of these multiple components, which, at some 
point, are assembled together to implement the  
 
shielding approach. What is needed, however, is a shielding 
approach for the modular components of a computer 
system which is reliable, inexpensive, and 
relatively straightforward to implement. More 
specifically, what is needed is an effective EMI 
shielding approach which uses as few components as 
possible. This invention teaches an apparatus and method 
of providing inexpensive and
