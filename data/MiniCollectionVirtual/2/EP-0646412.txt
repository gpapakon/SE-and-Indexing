<ABSTRACT>
Catalytic composition resulting from the dissolving of a complex of nickel mixed or complexed with a tertiary phosphene in the medium resulting from the mixing of at least one quaternary ammonium halide and/or at least one quaternary phosphonium halide, at least one aluminium halide, at least one aromatic hydrocarbon and optionally an organometallic aluminium compound. The invention also relates to a process for the dimerisation, codimerisation and oligomerisation of olefins with this composition.
