<ABSTRACT>
A system for synchronously activating cylinders of a 
multi cylinder, fuel injected, four stroke cycle internal 

combustion engine, includes a valve operator (16) for 
deactivating intake and exhaust valves associated with the 

cylinders and a controller (10) for selecting a cylinder to 
be deactivated, as well as a timing mechanism for 

determining when the selected cylinder is operating during 
intake events. The controllers (10) directs the valve 

operator to begin deactivating the valves of a selected 
cylinder during a predetermined intake event, with the valve 

operator completing the deactivation by a time not later 
than the beginning of the next exhaust event.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a system for controlling a 
multi-cylinder variable displacement internal combustion 
engine so as to manage the deactivation and reactivation of 
cylinders within the engine. Automotive vehicle designers and manufacturers have 
realised for years that it is possible to obtain increased 
fuel efficiency if an engine can be operated on less than 
the full complement of cylinders during certain running 
conditions. Accordingly, at low speed, low load operation, 
it is possible to save fuel if the engine can be run on four 
instead of eight cylinders or three, instead of six 
cylinders. In fact, one manufacturer offered a 4-6-8 
variable displacement engine several years ago, and Ford 
Motor Company designed a 6-cylinder engine capable of 
operation on only three cylinders which, although never 
released for production, was developed to a highly refined 
state. Unfortunately, both of the aforementioned engines 
suffered from deficiencies associated with their control 
strategies. Specifically, customer acceptance of the engine 
system actually in production was unsatisfactory because the 
powertrain tended to "hunt" or shift frequently between the 
various cylinder operating modes. In other words, the 
engine would shift from four to eight cylinder operation 
frequently, while producing noticeable torque excursions. 
This had the undesirable effect of causing the driver to 
perceive excessive changes in transmission gear in the 
nature of downshifting or upshifting. Another drawback to 
prior art systems resided in the fact that the engine 
emissions were not properly controlled because the fuel 
injection and valve timing could not be properly controlled. It is an object of the present invention to provide a 
system for operating an engine's intake and exhaust valves 
so as to accomplish transitions between maximum operation  
 
with all cylinders activated and fractional operation with 
only some of the cylinders activated, without causing 
excessive exhaust emissions, and with maximum gains in 
engine efficiency. Efficiency is promoted with the present 
system because exhaust gas is trapped in the deactivated 
cylinders; this gas is alternately compressed and expanded 
during subsequent cycles, with the result that very little 
energy is lost. A system for synchronously activating one or more of 
the cylinders of a multi cylinder, fuel injected, four 
stroke cycle internal combustion engine includes valve 
operator means for deactivating intake and exhaust valves 
associated

<CLAIMS>
A system for synchronously activating cylinders 
of a multi cylinder, fuel injected, four stroke cycle 

internal combustion engine, comprising: 
   valve operator means (16) for deactivating intake and 

exhaust valves associated with said cylinders; 
   a plurality of fuel injectors (14), with one of said 

injectors being associated with each of said cylinders; 
and 

   control means (10) including means for selecting a 
cylinder to be deactivated and timing means for 

determining when the selected cylinder is operating during 
intake events, with said control means (10) directing said 

valve operator means (16) to begin deactivating the valves 
of the selected cylinder during a predetermined intake 

event, with the valve operator completing the deactivation 
by a time not later than the beginning of the next exhaust 

event of the selected cylinder. 
A system according to Claim 1, wherein said 
control means directs said valve operator means to begin 

deactivating said valves at approximately the beginning of 
the intake stroke of the selected cylinder. 
A system according to Claim 1, wherein said 
control means further comprises means for deactivating the 

fuel injector associated with the selected cylinder by the 
time the selected cylinder has finished the predetermined 

intake event. 
A system according to Claim 3, wherein said 
control means directs said valve operator means to begin 

deactivating said valves while simultaneously deactivating 
said fuel injector. 
A system according to Claim 1, wherein the 
control means deactivates successive cylinders such that 

each deactivated cylinder will be filled with exhaust gas 
from its final power stroke. 
A system according to Claim 1, wherein said 
control means reactivates any cylinder which has been 

deactivated by directing the valve operator means to begin 
reactivating the selected cylinder during the time an intake 

event would occur if the intake valve were operational, with 
the valve operator completing the reactivation by a time not 

later than the beginning of the next exhaust event. 
A system according to Claim 6, wherein said 
control means reactivates the fuel injector associated with 

the selected cylinder prior to the intake event of the 
selected cylinder which follows the first reactivated 

exhaust event. 
A system according to Claim 6, wherein the 
control means reactivates successive cylinders such that 

each reactivated cylinder will draw a fresh charge during 
its first intake stroke. 
A system according to Claim 1, wherein the 
exhaust valve of a selected cylinder is deactivated before 

the intake valve is deactivated, with the exhaust valve of 
any deactivated cylinder being reactivated before the intake 

valve is reactivated. 
A method for synchronously activating the 
cylinders of a multi cylinder, individually fuel injected, 

four stroke cycle internal combustion engine, comprising the 
steps of: 

   selecting a cylinder to be deactivated; 
   determining when the selected cylinder is operating 

during an intake event;
 

   directing a valve operator to begin deactivating the 
selected cylinder during a predetermined intake event, 

with the valve operator completing the deactivation by a 
time not later than the beginning of the next exhaust 

event, and 
   deactivating the fuel injector associated with the 

selected cylinder by a time not later than the time by 
which the selected cylinder has finished the intake event, 

whereby the selected cylinder will contain a mass of 
exhaust gas which is chemically correct for an exhaust 

after treatment device. 
A method according to Claim 10, further 
providing for the reactivation of any particular deactivated 

cylinder, by the steps of: 
   selecting a cylinder to be reactivated; 

   determining when the selected cylinder would be

   directing the valve operator to begin activating the 
selected cylinder during the time the intake event would 

otherwise occur, with the valve operator completing the 
activation by a time not later than the beginning of the 

next exhaust event, and 
   activating the fuel injector associated with the 

selected cylinder by a time not later than the time by 
which the exhaust valve has been reactivated.
