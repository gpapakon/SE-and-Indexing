<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an apparatus
controlling the engine torque of a vehicle.
In particular, the apparatus forming
the subject of the present invention relates to a control
strategy for controlling the introduction of fuel into
the cylinders of the engine, causing it to change from a
normal fuel-delivery condition to a fuel cut-off
condition and vice versa.As is known, in motor vehicles it is desirable to cut off
the fuel delivery when useful power from the engine is
not required, that is to say when the accelerator pedal
is completely released (and therefore when the induction
manifold butterfly valve reaches the minimum position)
and when simultaneously the speed of the engine is
greater than a predetermined threshold value. Normal
fuel-delivery conditions are reintroduced (from the fuel
cut-off condition) when the accelerator pedal is pressed
(and therefore when the induction manifold butterfly
valve is displaced from its minimum position) or when the
speed of rotation of the engine is less than the
predetermined threshold value. Systems currently in use
which allow the change from normal fuel-delivery
conditions to fuel cut-off conditions and vice versa
envisage, in equal measure for all cylinders of the 
engine and after a predetermined time or after a
predetermined number of engine phases, the cut-off (or
increase) by 100% of the fuel in one or two stages.According to what is described in French Patent Application N° 2406080,
it is known to progressively modify, during the entry in
a cut-off condition, the fuel supply to the cylinders of an internal combustion engine in order to
smooth transients in engine output torque.GB-A-2 138 176 proposes-during fuel recovery-after a cut-off condition, the use of several fuel increment tables, the tables being selected according the magnitude of change of the engine speed.The systems just described involve several disadvantages
which exhibit themselves in particular in making the
vehicle unpleasant to drive due to the sharp change from
positive torque conditions to negative torque conditions
and vice versa; which sharp transfer causes jerks and
jolts of the engine. It is clear that the vibration
which thus occurs in the engine increases the wear of the
various parts of the engine. Moreover, in passing from
fuel cut-off conditions to normal delivery conditions the
quantity of fuel to provide is defined, in a single
solution, independently from the reason (variation in the
induction butterfly angle or variation in the speed of
rotation of the
