<ABSTRACT>
Hand-held telephones are known as so-called hand-helds for mobile radio or as cordless telephones. They have the dimensions of a handset and their antennas radiate close to the head. It is the object of the invention to design a hand-held radio telephone which is distinguished by compactness, full operability and low RF radiation with respect to its user. A hand-held radio telephone (HH1) is provided, the receiver (R) and/or microphone (M) of which are spatially remote from the remaining components of the hand-held radio telephone. The user can also be acoustically connected wirelessly by means of an infrared connection in order to increase the freedom of movement of the user further. Furthermore, the keyboard and display are accessible without restrictions during the use of the hand-held radio telephone.

<CLAIMS>
A hand-held radiotelephone (HH1; HH2) with components 
comprising RF transmitting/receiving means (TC, A) for radio 

communication within a telecommuncation system, control means (KB) 
for establishing a communication link, only one electroacoustic 

reproducing means (R), and only one electroacoustic pickup means 
(M),
characterized by
 a housing which comprises all 
components of the hand-held radiotelephone (HH1; HH2) except at 

least one of the electroacoustic means (R), whereby said at least 
one electroacoustic means (R) is spatially separated from the other 

means (TC, A, KB, DIS, CAM). 
A hand-held radiotelephone (HH2),
 
characterized in that the components additionally comprise 

electrooptical display and/or pickup means (DIS, CAM), and that 
only one of the electroacoustic means (R) is spatially separated 

from the other means (TC, A, DIS, CAM).  
 
A hand-held radiotelephone (HH1) as claimed in claim 1,
 
characterized in that those of the electroacoustic means (R) which 

are spatially separated from the other means (TC, A, KB) are 
connected to the RF transmitting/receiving means (TC, A) by wire, 

using at least one separable connector (P). 
A hand-held radiotelephone (HH2) as claimed in claim 1,
 
characterized in that those electroacoustic means (R) which are 

spatially separated from the other means (TC, A, DIS, CAM) are 
connected to the RF transmitting/receiving means (TC, A) without 

wires, using at least one transmitting means (IRT) and at least one 
receiving means (IRR). 
A hand-held radiotelephone (HH2) as claimed in claim 4,
 
characterized in that the transmitting means (IRT) and the 

receiving means (IRR) transmit and receive infrared signals, 
respectively. 
A hand-held radiotelphone (HH2) as claimed in claim 4,
 
characterized in that mechanical and/or electromechanical 

connecting means (P1, P2) are provided for interconnecting the 
spatially separated means (R, TC). 
A hand-held radiotelephone (HH1) as claimed in claim 1,
 
characterized in that the electroacoustic pickup means (M) is a 

directional microphone provided in the housing of the hand-held 
radiotelephone (HH1). 
A hand-held radiotelephone as claimed in claim 1 or 2,
 
characterized in that only the electroacoustic pickup means is 

spatially separated from the other means, the electroacoustic 
pickup means being a microphone located remotely from the other 

components.  
 
A hand-held radiotelephone (HH2) as claimed in claim 1 or 2,
 
characterized in that the housing of the hand-held radiotelephone 

(HH2) is so designed that it can be held in the hand and set down 
on a supporting surface.
