<DESCRIPTION>
 Breath Testing Apparatus This invention relates to breath testing apparatus for detecting volatile components, such as ethanol, in a subject's breath by oxidising them in a fuel cell. Such apparatus is frequently used out in the open and may therefore have to operate in a wide range of temperatures. It is known that the fuel cell response is affected by temperature and attempts have been made to overcome this variation by heating the fuel cell so that it sits at or above a predetermined temperature by using thermistor control. However, this approach can cause problems both due to signal noise created by the heater and because it is difficult for the batteries in portable devices to supply sufficient current to run both the heater and the electronics associated with the fuel cell during the actual measurement process.According to one aspect the present invention consists in breath testing apparatus including a fuel cell for producing an output signal, a housing for the fuel cell, a breath sampling means connected to the housing for drawing a breath sample into the fuel cell, a thermistor for detecting the temperature of the housing, compensation means for correcting the output signal of the fuel cell in accordance with the temperature detected by the thermistor and means for displaying the corrected signal.The apparatus may further include a heater, disposed within the housing, a thermistor for controlling the heater to maintain a part of the housing, adjacent the fuel cell. 

at or above a predetermined temperature and means for disabling the heater during the operation of the fuel cell. The thermistor for controlling the heater may also constitute the thermistor for detecting the temperature of the housing. The heater may be in the form of a coil or disc and the temperature-controlling thermistor may be disposed at or adjacent the centre of the coil or disc.The compensation means may include means for computing the corrected output in accordance with the following formula:BAC =BACAxB+Cx-Dx2wherein BACC is the corrected Breath Alcohol Concentration BACA is the actual Breath Alcohol Concentration measured by the fuel cell; A is the concentration of the ethanol solution used to calibrate the fuel cell;B,C+D are constants characteristic of the fuel cell being used and of its housing; and x is the temperature detected.From another aspect the invention consists in a method of operating a breath testing apparatus having a fuel cell in a fuel cell chamber, including detecting the temperature of the fuel cell
