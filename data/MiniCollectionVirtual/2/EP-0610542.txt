<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a lock (1) to be used, in particular, on doors of apartments, in particular a lock (1) which can be actuated by a drive rod, which lock divides up the locking position to the frame-side striking plate (44) by subdividing the bolt-member movement, this resulting first of all in the bolt moving forwards by a tightening movement made possible by a bolt bevel and, subsequently, a bolt interconnecting engagement to the striking plate (44). For the purpose of optimising the closure method, the invention proposes to provide two mutually adjacent bolt members (A, B), of which one bolt member (B), exhibiting the bolt-member bevel (37), is controlled such that it leads during the closure movement. On the other hand, the bolt member (A) causing the interconnecting engagement [lacuna] via a pivot member.

Lock (1) for use especially on locking doors of 
residences, especially a lock capable of actuation by a drive 

rod, which breaks down the locking position to the striking 
plate (44) on the frame side by subdivision of the movement 

of the bolt member in such a way that firstly a simple bolt 
advancement with a drawing-in moment enabled by a bolt 

chamfer (37) is achieved and followed by a bolt interlocking 
engagement with the striking plate (44), characterised by 

two bolt members (A, B) adjacent to one another, of which one 
bolt member (B) exhibiting the bolt member chamfering (37) is 

steered forward during the locking movement towards the other 
bolt member (A) through a pivot movement affording the 

interlocking engagement. 
Lock according to Claim 1, characterised in that the bolt 
member (B) exhibiting the chamfering (37) is designed as a 

linearly extending bar (35). 
Lock according to one or several of the preceding claims, 
characterised in that the bolt member (A) pivoting out is 

designed as a hook locking bar (22) which in the locked-out 
position is secured against being pushed back by a blocking 

projection (32). 
Lock according to one or several of the preceding claims, 
characterised in that the hook locking bar (22) possesses a 

catch (26) projecting into the hook mouth (23) which in the 
locked-out position moves against the rearward surface of the 

cuff (4). 
Lock according to one or several of the preceding claims, 
characterised by an actuating slider (18) which is drive rod-controlled 

for both bolt members (A, B) and stands in slot/pin 
control to the bolt member (B) exhibiting the chamfering (37)  

 
of the bolt member and which possesses a control cam (29) for 

pivoting the hook locking bar (22) in and out. 
Lock according to one or several of the preceding claims, 
characterised in that the control cam (29) runs along a control 

flank (27) of the hook locking bar (22), while the bolt member 
(B) forming the chamfer (37) travels out through a slot section 

(41) running at a slope, and which control cam (29) then 
encounters a run up slope (28) adjacent to the bolt member 

pivot pin (17) and thus drives the hook locking bar (22) out, 
whilst the bolt member (B) carrying the chamfer (37) is located 

with its pin (39) in a slot section (42) which extends parallel 
to the displacement direction of the actuating slide (18). 
Lock according to one or several of the preceding claims, 
characterised in that the hook locking bar (22) possesses a 

peripherally open recess (30) with run off slope (31) for the 
blocking projection (39).
