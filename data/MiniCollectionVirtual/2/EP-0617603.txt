<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to disposable absorbent 
articles, particularly to disposable absorbent articles such 
as diapers which collect and retain fecal material, and more 
particularly to disposable absorbent articles having selectively 
disposed spacers which allow for containment and 
isolation of fetal material. Disposable absorbent articles, such as baby diapers and 
adult incontinence products are well known in the art. 
These articles represent consumer products which address the 
consumers' demand for products which increases the convenience 
of everyday living. In particular, it has long been 
desired to provide disposable absorbent articles which are 
easily removed from the wearer when soiled and minimize 
cleaning of the wearer after removal. A particularly 
desired feature of such a disposable absorbent article is to 
minimize cleaning of fecal material which is present on the 
wearer's skin after the soiled disposable absorbent article 
is removed. One particular attempt to improve cleaning of fecal 
material from the skin of the wearer is to provide a void  
 
space in the disposable absorbent article to receive the 
fecal material and isolate it from the skin of the wearer. 
Typically, the void space is intermediate the topsheet which 
contacts the skin of the wearer and the core which absorbs 
fluid excretions, such as urine. In this arrangement, the 
topsheet has an aperture or other passageway which communicates 
the fecal material to the void space. For example, U.S. Patent 4,662,877 issued May 5, 1987 
to Williams discloses a diaper having a urine impervious 
facing sheet with an aperture which allows waste materials 
to pass through the facing sheet into the absorbent portion 
of the diaper. The void space in the Williams diaper is 
formed by a convex upwardly shaped core. Another manner in which a void space may be formed is 
by removing material from the core to provide a cavity. For 
example, U.S. Patent 2,043,325 issued June 9, 1936 to 
Jackson, Jr. discloses a sanitary pad having a pocket to 
receive eliminated stools. The pocket is formed by the 
removal of loosely packed material from the top layer of the 
absorbent in the pad. This construction is also shown in 
the catamenial napkin art, as illustrated in U.S. Patent 
4,731,065 issued March 15, 1988 to Yamada. Yamada teaches a 
sanitary napkin having a recess which circumscribes the 
excretory organs and formed by a void space in a flexible 
absorbent element. Another manner in which a void space may be formed is 
by

<CLAIMS>
A disposable absorbent article (20) having a front 
waist margin (32), a rear waist margin (34), a longitudinal 

centerline and a Z-direction orthogonal thereto, said 
disposable absorbent article comprising:
 
   a liquid impervious backsheet (24);
 
   a liquid pervious topsheet (22) at least partially 

peripherally joined to said backsheet to form a void space 
(52) intermediate said topsheet and said backsheet for 

receiving fecal material, said topsheet having an aperture 
(46) for communicating fecal material to the void space; 

and
 
   an absorbent core (26) intermediate said topsheet and 

said backsheet;
 
   characterized in that a spacing means (54, 56) is 

provided for maintaining the void space when the disposable 
absorbent article is loaded by the weight of a wearer, 

without interrupting the transport of fecal material away 
from said aperture (46) and towards said rear waist margin 

(34), said core comprises an upper layer (26U) joined to 
said topsheet (22) and a lower layer (26L) joined to said 

backsheet (24), and said means (54, 56) for maintaining 
said void space provides a Z-direction clearance between 

said upper layer and said lower layer. 
An article according to claim 1, wherein said spacing 
means comprises at least one generally longitudinally  

 
oriented spacer (54, 56) disposed in the rear portion of 

said article. 
An article according to claim 2, which comprises two 
said spacers (54), one disposed on each side of said 

longitudinal centerline. 
An article according to claim 3, wherein said two 
spacers (54) diverge towards said rear waist margin (34). 
An article according to claim 3 or 4, further 
comprising a central spacer (56) intermediate said two 

spacers (54). 
An article according to claim 5, wherein said central 
spacer (56) is longitudinally parallel to, and coincident 

with, said longitudinal axis. 
An article according to claim 5 or 6, wherein said 
central spacer (56) has an end which is juxtaposed with 

said aperture. 
An article according to claim 7, wherein said spacer 
end is tapered. 
An article according to any one of claims 3 to 8, 
wherein at least one of said spacers (54, 56) is 

transversely slit on the tension side of said spacer.  
 
An article according to any one of claims 3 to 9, 
wherein each of the said two spacers (54) 

extends the entire longitudinal dimension of said aperture 
(46).  

 
An article according to any one of claims 2 to 10, 
further comprising a transversely oriented spacer (58) 

disposed in the front portion of said article. 
An article according to any one of claims 2 to 11, 
wherein the or each said spacer (54, 56) is joined to said 

upper layer (26U) or said lower layer (26L). 
An article according to any preceding claim, wherein 
said topsheet (22) is foreshortened relative to said 

backsheet (24). 
An article according to any preceding claim, wherein 
said topsheet (22) has an elasticized panel (48) in the 

rear portion of said article. 
An article according to any preceding claim, wherein 
said upper layer (26U) and said lower layer (26L) have a 

space therebetween as measured on the longitudinal 
centerline of said disposable absorbent article of at least 

6.4mm under a pressure of 13,73 kPa (1.400 kilograms per 
square meter).  

 
An article according to any preceding claim, wherein 
the spacing means is selected from the group consisting of 

foam, rubber, twisted cellulose fibers, and fluid stable 
aggregates. 
An article according to claim 16, wherein the spacing 
means comprises high internal phase emulsion foam.
