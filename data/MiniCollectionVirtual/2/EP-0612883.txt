<ABSTRACT>
An arrangement in a dryer for a fibre web for sealing 
bands (5a, 5b) that move between a chamber (3) containing 

pressurized vapour and a chamber (1) containing 
pressurized water and transport a web (7) and a felt (8) 

between them, and also for sealing the edges of the 
chambers (1, 3). The arrangement comprises a closed 

recovery chamber (16) into which the edges of the bands 
(5a, 5b) extend and in which the vapour escaping from 

the vapour chamber (3) from between the band (5a) and 
the seals (9, 10) and the water escaping from the water 

chamber (1) from between the band (5b) and the seals 
(12, 13) gather, whereby the vapour and water can be 

discharged from the recovery chamber (16) such that they 
are cannot escape into surrounding air.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention concerns an arrangement in a
dryer for a fibre web, the arrangement comprising two
chambers that are one upon another and contain a pressurized
medium which in at least one of the chambers is
vapour and two impermeable bands travelling between the
chambers and forming an endless loop, each band providing
one wall for one chamber, the fibre web and the
wire in the arrangement travelling through the dryer
between the bands, and at least one sealing member being
provided between the edge of the body of the lower
chamber and the band next to it to effect sealing
between the moving band and the body of the chamber.This kind of arrangement is known e.g. from
Finnish Patent 76,192 or from DE 3 800 210 A1, which discloses a solution for
implementing sealing. In the FI patent, sealing is
effected by two seals arranged against the moving band,
a sealing liquid being supplied between the seals. Due
to this, vapour cannot escape from the vapour chamber
but only a sealing liquid discharges from between the
band and the seal. Although the solution is functional
as such, it is more advantageous with respect to the
operation and use of the apparatus to create a situation
where the seals are not as heavily loaded as earlier and
where the temperature of the hot band next to the vapour
chamber could be maintained essentially constant over
its entire breadth, whereby the thermal stress to which
the band is exposed decreases.Further, arrangements like this are previously
known from DE 3 129 206 A1 and
European Patent Application 01,26,865, which disclose
solutions relating to production of chipboard. The disadvantage
of DE 31,29, 206 is that due to the structure
pressurized vapour may escape as the thickness of the 
web varies and thus cause noise problems as well as
other problems brought about by escaping vapour. Also
in the solution of EP 01,26,865 vapour easily escapes,
causing noise problems as well as other problems brought
about by escaping vapour.Another solution relating to an arrangement of
this kind is known from Finnish Patent 66,041, where the
solution comprises a body that is rigid and heavy. In
this solution a great force is produced between the seal
and the band, whereby moving of the band requires great
power. Further, the frictional force causes the temperature
to rise high, whereby both the seal and the band
are easily damaged even in a short time. Also in this
publication the vapour escaping from between the seal
and the band causes noise problems as well as other
problems brought about by

An arrangement in a dryer for a fibre web,
the arrangement comprising two chambers (1, 3) that are

one upon another and contain a pressurized medium which
in at least one of the chambers (3) is vapour and two

impermeable bands (5a, 5b) travelling between the
chambers (1, 3) and forming an endless loop, each band

providing one wall for one chamber (1, 3), the fibre web
(7) and the wire (8) in the arrangement travelling

through the dryer between the bands (5a, 5b), and at
least one sealing member (12, 13) being provided between

the edge of the body (la) of the lower chamber (1) and
the band (5b) next to it to effect sealing between the

moving band (5b) and the body of the chamber (1),

characterised
 in that the arrangement comprises,
on the side of the chambers (1, 3), recovery

chambers (16) into which the edges of the bands (5a, 5b)
extend and which are isolated from the surrounding air

and the chambers (1, 3), the pressurized medium discharged
from both chambers (1, 3) from between the

bodies (1a, 3a) and the bands (5a, 5b) gathering in said
recovery chambers and being dischargeable therefrom

through outlet conduits (17).
The arrangement according to claim 1,

characterised
 in that discharging of the
pressurized medium from the recovery chambers (16) is

restricted such that a pressure that is lower than the
pressure in the chambers (1, 3) that contain pressurized

medium but higher than the atmospheric pressure is produced
in the recovery chamber (16).
The arrangement according to claim 1 or 2,
wherein the pressurized medium in the lower chamber (1)

is water, 
characterised
 in that between
the body (la) of the lower chamber (1) and the lower 

band (5b) there are two or more sealing surfaces that
face the band (5b) and are spaced from one another, and

supplying water between said sealing surfaces.
The arrangement according to claim 3,

characterised
 in that the sealing surfaces
are provided at the edges of the body (la) of the lower

chamber.
The arrangement according to claim 3,

characterised
 in that the sealing surfaces
are sealing surfaces of separate seals (12, 13) arranged
