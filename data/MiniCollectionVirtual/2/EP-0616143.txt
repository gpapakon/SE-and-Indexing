<ABSTRACT>
The brake disc is provided, in particular, as a wheel brake disc for rail vehicles and has a friction ring (3) divided at joints (6, 7) into ring segments (4, 5). On its side facing away from the side on which it is acted upon, the friction ring (3) is provided at each joint (6, 7) with an annular groove (13) which is arranged symmetrically on each side of the joint. In the annular grooves (13) are annular bodies (14) which at least almost completely fill them and which connect the opposing ends of the ring segments (4, 5) to one another. The annular bodies (14) prevent centrifugally induced widening of the joints (6, 7) and radial relative displacement of the ends of the ring segments while, with an air gap at the joints (6, 7), limited relative rotation of the end faces (9, 10) of the ring segments (4, 5) is possible.

Brake disc for disc brakes, in particular a wheel 
brake disc for rail vehicles, having a friction ring 

(3) which can be acted on by at least one brake shoe 
and comprises at least two friction ring segments 

(4, 5), each ring segment (4, 5) of which is mounted on 
a carrier body (wheel disc 2), and having connecting 

elements at the intersections (6, 7) of the ring 
segments (4, 5) which join their opposite ends and 

exclude at least radial relative movements of the ring 
segments (4, 5), characterised in that the friction 

ring (3) has annular grooves (13) on at least one side 
open to this side, symmetrical to the intersections 

(6, 7) of the ring segments (4, 5), and bridging these 
intersections (6, 7), the axes of these annular grooves 

(13) extending parallel to the axis of the friction 
ring (3) and their depth being less than the axial 

width of the ring segments (4, 5), and in that into 
each annular groove (13) there is inserted an annular 

body (14) which fills this groove at least almost 
completely and bridges the intersection (6, 7) and 

which may be composed of several concentric individual 
rings. 
Brake disc according to claim 1, characterised in 
that the annular grooves (13) are located only on 

the side of the friction ring (3) not acted on and in 
that their depth is less than the axial width of the 

ring segments (4, 5) in their final wear state. 
Brake disc according to claim 1 or 2, characterised 
in that an annular groove (13) with an annular body 

(14) is provided for each intersection (6, 7), the 
common axis extending in the central region of the  

 
intersection (6, 7) with respect to the radial 

extension of the intersection (6, 7) towards the brake 
disc. 
Brake disc according to claim 3, characterised in 
that the outer diameter of the annular groove (13) 

corresponds approximately to half the radial width of 
the ring segments (4, 5). 
Brake disc according to claim 4, characterised in 
that in the vicinity of the intersections (6, 7) and 

radially offset to the annular grooves (13) the ring 
segments (4, 5) are connected to the carrier body 

(wheel disc 2) by means of substantially pin-like 
retaining elements (screws 11, clamping sleeves 12). 
Brake disc according to one of claims 3, 4 or 5, 
characterised in that the friction ring (3) is provided 

with cylindrical recesses (15), coaxial with the 
annular grooves (13), which respectively engage at 

least semi-cylindrically into the facing ends (9, 10) 
of two ring segments (4, 5), the recesses having a 

diameter smaller than the inner diameter of the annular 
grooves (13) and being open at least towards the side 

of the friction ring (3) not acted on, and in that 
inserted into each cylindrical recess (15) is a 

circular disc (16), at least almost completely filling 
it (Figure 2, 3). 
Brake disc according to claim 6, characterised in 
that the cylindrical recesses (15) are open, with a 

reduced diameter, to the side of the friction ring (3) 
which can be acted on by the brake shoe, their ends 

being chamfered for about the depth of the wear region 
of the friction ring (3).  

 
Brake disc according to one of claims 3, 4 or 5, 
characterised in that the friction ring is provided 

with spherical recesses, located centrally with respect 
to the annular grooves, which respectively engage 

hemispherically into the facing ends of two annular 
segments, the recesses having a diameter smaller than 

the inner diameter of the annular grooves, and in that 
inserted into each spherical recess is a sphere which 

fills it at least almost completely. 
Brake disc according to one of the preceding 
claims, characterised in that the intersections (6, 7) 

have an air gap (18) between the facing ends (9, 10) of 
two ring segments (4, 5) which is bridged by the 

annular body (14) and, in the case of the construction 
according to claim 5, additionally the circular disc 

(16). 
Brake disc according to claim 9, characterised in 
that the transition from the surface of a ring segment 

(4, 5) that can be acted on by the brake shoe to its 
end surface (9, 10) is chamfered by means of an 

inclined surface (17) (Figure 3). 
Brake disc according to one or more of claims 1 
to 8, characterised in that at the intersections (6) 

the opposing ends (9, 10) of two ring segments (4, 5) 
are adjacent and engage into each other with teeth 

(Figure 4). 
Brake disc according to claim 11, characterised in 
that the two ring segments (4, 5) are produced by 

breaking an annular body, the roughness of the fracture 
forming the teeth (Figure 4).
