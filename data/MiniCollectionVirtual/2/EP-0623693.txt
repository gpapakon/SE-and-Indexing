<ABSTRACT>
The present invention relates to an improved spinning block (1) for 
spinning molten thermoplastic material to obtain synthetic yarn, 

said spinning block (1) comprising a clamping ring (6) operating at the 
lower end of the circumferential edge of the spinning block (1) to fix 

this latter to the overlying boiler body (11) by means of a releasable 
connection comprising threads (9) of one or more starts or cam-like 

projections.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to an improved spinning block for spinning 
thermoplastic material in which said block comprises a clamping 
means for removably connecting the spinning block to a boiler 
body of a spinning machine. It is known to produce yarn from thermoplastic masses such as 
polyesters, polyamides etc. by an extrusion spinning process. In 
this process the starting polymer, which is initially in the solid 
state, is transferred by a heating process into the liquid state 
and is then suitably fed to the actual spinning block's. Said 
spinning blocks have a heating system using diphenyl vapour or a 
similar fluid originating from a vapour generator in common with a 
ducting system for distributing the directly fed vapour. In known 
quadrangular or circular arrangements the individual spinning 
blocks are positioned one following the other along the spinning 
beam of the boiler body. The heat from the diphenyl vapour is transferred to the blocks by 
thermal conductivity or by thermal convection. Arrangements of 
this kind have been known for some time in the synthetic yarn 
production field. However, even today such spinning blocks suffer 
from various technical problems from a number of aspects. For  
 
example the spinning block illustrated and described in European 
patent 0163248 has its threaded upper end arranged to connect to 
the threaded circumferential side of a flange previously screwed 
to the boiler body. Although this type of fixing may be satisfactory, it allows poor 
accessibility for the screwing operation together with visual 
inaccessibility for the operator who has to connect and remove the 
spinning block to and from the boiler body. It should be noted that connecting and removing the spinning block 
to and from the boiler body, or more precisely the spinning beam, 
are operations which arise fairly frequently during normal 
maintenance and during the changing of yarn production batches. The said fixing operation requires a certain ability on the part 
of the operator as he cannot directly see the two threaded 
portions to be connected together, with the possibility therefore 
of imprecise initial screwing with damage to the threads. These 
threads can also be damaged by impact and by the presence of 
particles soiling the thread, all this being the result of the 
fact that the joint is in an upper internal position not visible 
to the operator connecting the spinning block. It is apparent to the expert that in the light of the aforegoing 
discourse on the state of the art

<CLAIMS>
A spinning block for spinning molten thermoplastic 
material to obtain yarn, comprising a support and fixing element 

for housing a distributor disc for the molten mass, a filter cylinder 
and at least one gauging nozzle disc forming the spinning die, 

said element being removably fixable to a boiler body of a 
spinning machine within a skirt rigid with the boiler body, 

characterised by further comprising a clamping ring to be 
associated with the lower end of said support and fixing element 

to removably connect it rigidly to the overlying boiler body. 
A spinning block as claimed in claim 1, characterised in 
that the clamping ring has a peripheral thread with one or more 

starts, engageable with a corresponding thread in a central hole 
of a plate rigidly fixed to the skirt of the boiler body. 
A spinning block as claimed in claim 1, characterised in 
that the clamping ring comprises on its peripheral surface cam-like 

circumferential projections for its removable connection to 
the plate rigidly fixed to the lower end of the boiler body. 
A spinning block as claimed in one of the preceding 
claims, characterised in that the boiler body comprises at least 

one support peg or the like projecting towards the interior of the 
housing seat for said support and fixing element, said element 

having at least one circumferential groove and, in its outer wall, 
at least one recess connecting said groove to the upper edge of 

said element, said recess and said groove being such as to enable 
said support and fixing element to undergo axial movement beyond 

said peg or the like when said element is in a corresponding 
 

angular position, and to support said element by the engagement of 
said peg or the like in said groove when said support and fixing 

element is in another angular position before applying said 

clamping ring for fixing said element to the boiler body. 
A spinning block as claimed in claim 4, characterised in 
that said groove has a width in the longitudinal direction of said 

element which is greater than the diameter of said peg or the 
like. 
A spinning block as claimed in claim 4 or 5, characterised 
in that said groove extends through the entire circumferential 

development of said element. 
A spinning block as claimed in claim 6, characterised in 
that the clamping ring comprises engagement means for its 

rotational engagement with said element during the fixing and 
removal of said element to and from the boiler body. 
A spinning block as claimed in claim 7, characterised in 
that said engagement means comprise at least one pin projecting 

radially into said ring and at least one recess provided in the 
lower edge of said support and fixing element. 
A spinning block as claimed in one or more of claims 4 to 
8, characterised in that said recess and said groove are provided 

at the upper end of said support and fixing element. 
A spinning block as claimed in one or more of claims 1, 4, 
5, 6, 7, 8, 9, characterised in that said ring is removably 

fixable by rotation to the lower part of said skirt of the boiler 
body.
