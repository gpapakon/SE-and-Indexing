<ABSTRACT>
A distribution duct includes a plurality of cable shelves for distribution 
of power cables, i.e. heavy current cables (23), data connections, 

telephone cables and/or cables (25) from outlet sockets 
and with a plurality of turnable terminal means (10) provided in 

connection with at least one of the shelves. In front of the shelf, 
sliding panels (30) are arranged which can be lifted upwards 

when the user wishes to have access to the terminal means (10) 
at this shelf. The connecting means may be a terminal means (10) 

which can turn about a first pivot while an inner terminal means 
can optionally turn about a second pivot arranged perpendicular 

to said first pivot. 
The turnable terminal means (10) renders it possible to make the 
distribution duct (20) narrower than previously known for distribution 

ducts with built-in hidden terminal means. 
The terminal means is preferably supplied with power through a 
cable current collector module (50) with a base member with two 

wings, one wing on each side of the current collector module. 
Each wing forms at least one bearing or hinge carrying the substantially 

vertical pivot, about which the terminal means (10) can 
turn.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a distribution duct for distribution of
insulated electric cables and a plurality of internally mounted terminal
means, such as outlet sockets and plugs, as well as a front panel hiding
both cables and terminal means with plugs mounted therein, said terminal
means being connected to power supply means.Danish printed accepted specification No. 150,871 B discloses a cable
channel including several small channels for power cables, low current
signalling cables, data cables and telephone cables, and outlet sockets for
the connection of plugs on cables extending from equipment arranged in
the room outside the channel. A horizontal upper channel wall is hinged to
a vertical front channel wall and to the back wall. The channel is opened
by lifting up the upper channel wall with the result that the front channel
wall follows the upward lifting and the plugs become visible and accessible
for the arranging of mains plugs for the power supply of the associated
equipment. The lower channel wall, viz. the channel bottom, is so narrow
that an open space exists between said lower channel wall and the front
wall. The connected mains cables, data connections, and telephones cables
pass through the above space. This cable channel is rather wide because
the outlet sockets and the associated cable plugs and cables take up considerable
space.German application No. 2,946,841 corresponds to Swedish
printed accepted specification No. 425,758 and describes furthermore a
cable channel for electrical installations and the like, where the outlet 
sockets are mounted below a cable shelf and are covered by a front panel.
Other distribution devices are known from EP 0,375,607 and GB
1,423,062.EP 0 375 607 shows some sockets, the
inclination of which can be adjusted, preferably by an electrician.The object of the present invention is to provide a distribution duct, also
called a cable channel, with internal terminal means, such as outlet sockets
hidden behind a front panel, and especially a channel being narrower than
the known channels with internal, hidden outlet sockets, and which at the
same time is easy to mount with current collector modules and outlet
sockets for the electrician and easy to use for the daily user.The advantage of using narrow cable channels is found in the efficient area
available for furnishing and utilizing the room thereby being larger than
the room available in connection with a broader cable channel.According to the invention this object is obtained by means of a
