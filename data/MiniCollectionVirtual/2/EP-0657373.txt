<ABSTRACT>
In a vacuum chuck apparatus for chucking an 
article, a plurality of movable suction cups (12,13) are mounted 

on a support member (1) to be movable up and down relative to 
the support member between an operative position where 

each of the movable suction cups can attract the article 
by suction and a retracted position above the operative 

position. A plurality of air cylinders (21,22) move the 
respective suction cups independently from each other 

between the operative position and the retracted 
position. An article size designating circuit (80) outputs a 

size signal representing the size of the article to be 
chucked, and a controller (70) controls the air cylinders 

according to the size signal so that a part of the 
movable suction cups which are not necessary for chucking 

the article of the size represented by the size signal 
are held in the retracted position and the other suction 

cups are held in the operative position.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a vacuum chuck apparatus as defined
in the preamble of claim 1, for chucking an article like a plate, box or
the like, and more particularly to a vacuum chuck
apparatus which has a plurality of suction cups and in
which the number of the suction cups to be actually
operated is changed according the size of the article to
be handled. A vacuum chuck apparatus of the type as defined above is described in EP-A-348 311.
The apparatus includes a plurality of suction cups, each controlled independently of the
other by an electromagnetic means for opening and closing the suction line providing each
specific suction cup with the vacuum pressure. The electromagnets are controlled by a
control means in accordance with the specific size and shape of the article to be handled.
All suction cups are fixedly attached to the support member.EP-A-336 799 discloses a vacuum chuck apparatus consisting of a plurality of movable
suction cups mounted on a support member, to be movable between an operative position
and a retracted position. All suction cups of this apparatus are movable. There further has been known a vacuum chuck apparatus for
chucking an article like a plate, box or the like such as
a glass plate, a corrugated box or the like. The vacuum
chuck apparatus has a plurality of suction cups fixed to
a base member such as a chuck frame. The suction cups
are pressed against a predetermined surface of the
article to be chucked and the air in the suction cups is
evacuated to make the pressure in the space surrounded by
each suction cup and the predetermined surface of the
article, whereby the article is chucked by the vacuum
chuck apparatus by suction.When such a vacuum chuck apparatus is used for
transferring articles, the vacuum chuck apparatus should
agree with the size of the article. However when
separate vacuum chuck apparatuses are prepared for the 
articles of different sizes, operating cost rises and a
large spaces is required.Accordingly, it is preferred that a single vacuum
chuck apparatus can be used for chucking articles of
different sizes. An example of such a "free-size" vacuum
chuck apparatus is disclosed in Japanese Utility Model
Publication No. 47(1972)-12624. In the free-size vacuum
chuck apparatus, a plurality of suction cups are mounted
in array on a chuck frame. The suction cups positioned
in the middle of the array are fixed to the chuck frame
and are constantly operated irrespective of the size of
the article to be chucked, while the suction cups
positioned in end

<CLAIMS>
A vacuum chuck apparatus for chucking an article (100) comprising:

a plurality of suction cups (11,12,13) mounted on a support member (1,2)
and distributed over a surface area thereof, an article size designating

means (80) which outputs a size signal representing the size of the article
(100) to be chucked, and a control means (70) for controlling the operation

of the suction cups (11,12,13) according to the size signal from the article
size designating means (80) so that a part of the suction cups (12,13)

which are not necessary for chucking the article (100) of the size
represented by the size signal are held inoperative,
characterised in that

said plurality of suction cups (11, 12, 13) are arranged in groups including a
group of at least one fixed suction cup (11), a group of inner movable suction

cups (12) and a group of outer movable suction cups (13), said inner and outer
movable suction cups (12,13) mounted on the support member (1) to be

movable up and down relative to the support member (1) between an operative
position where each of the movable suction cups (12,13) can attract the article

(100) by suction and a retracted position above the operative position, a
plurality of drive means (21,22) are provided which move the respective group

of inner or outer movable suction cups (12,13) up and down relative to the
support member (1) independently from each other between the operative

position and the retracted position, said drive means including a plurality of air
cylinders (21,22) mounted on said support member (1), with each of said air

cylinders associated with a corresponding one of the movable suction cups
(12,13), an air pump (60) for supplying pressurised air to said air cylinders

(21,22), air lines (52,53,54,56) which connect said air pump (60) to said air
