<ABSTRACT>
A circuit device for visually signalling leakage 
currents from an electric system to earth essentially 

consists of a differential magnetic flux detector (3) 
for detecting the difference between the magnetic flux 

interwound with the input conductor of the electric 
system feeding line and the flux interwound with the 

output conductor of the same feeding line, said detector 
(3) being connected to a plurality of selective 

comparators (6, 7, 8, 9, 10) for selection of the 
absorption current, each of which acts within given 

thresholds of a division scale of the absorption 
currents and is associated with a corresponding luminous 

indicator (11, 12, 13, 14, 15) signalling the detected 
absorption.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a device for visually 
signalling leakage currents from an electric system to 
earth. It is known that in domestic and industrial electric 
systems the so-called "common earthing or grounding" is 
imposed both for meeting the provisions of law in the 
matter and for technical reasons. In fact a precise grounding installation is imposed by 
law, and all domestic and industrial apparatus as well 
as the electric system proper must be conformed to it 
from a constructional and operational point of view in 
order to protect an operator against possible electrical 
discharges and also safeguard the apparatus themselves 
(above all if they are of the electronic type) against 
anomalous currents and/or disturbance voltages. Grounding or earthing is made by one suitably-shaped 
metal body or a plurality of them. Said bodies are 
usually named "ground electrodes" and are embedded in 
the earth for establishing an appropriate galvanic 
connection. Ground electrodes are then connected, through 
appropriate collectors, to a plurality of ground 
conductors in turn connected to respective parts of the 
electric system. By so doing all electric currents that may be conducted 
to earth due to a failure in the insulation of an 
apparatus or system are dissipated into the earth, said 
currents being referred to as leakage currents. In many cases the earth is also utilized for permanently  
 
connecting all points of an electric circuit that in 
operation "closes" to ground. Therefore "grounding or earthing" means to physically 
connect an electric system or given parts of an 
apparatus to a ground for the purpose of keeping the 
potential of that system or apparatus parts to a fixed 
reference value. In other cases the earth connection 
aims at preventing given parts of an apparatus usually 
unenergized from taking dangerous potentials, for lack 
of insulation or other reasons. It is therefore very important to know and detect 
leakage currents to the earth. In fact the presence of 
leakage currents means that a bad insulation exists or, 
in other cases, it is evidence of an irregular operation 
of an apparatus (closed to ground). In the connection it is to be pointed out that a leakage 
current is established when, due to any accidental 
reason (bad insulation, failure, etc.) one part that is 
not to be energized, such as the metal framework of a 
machine or an electric board is on the contrary 
subjected to a potential difference. In this case there 
is a leakage in an electric system
