<ABSTRACT>
In this safety device, an attachment housing (6) arranged on the supporting frame of an elevator has recesses in which guides of a brake device (9) engage, as a result of which the brake device (9) is displaceably mounted in the attachment housing (6). The attachment housing (6) is arranged on the supporting frame in such a way that the brake device (9) encloses a free leg (2.2) with running surfaces (2.3) of a guide rail. For each running surface (2.3), the brake device (9) has a brake plate (12) carried by a brake-plate holder (12.1) and having a brake sensor (13). The brake sensor (13) embedded in the brake plate (12) serves to monitor the brake plate (12). During braking, at least one brake plate (12) is actuated by a brake cylinder (14) which is arranged on the brake device (9) and is connected to a pressure-medium device by means of a pressure-medium line.

Safety equipment for a lift cage (3) with a braking equipment (9)
engaging at a guide rail (2), wherein the braking force exerted by the

braking equipment (9) on the guide rail (2) is regulated by a regulating
equipment (16), characterised thereby, that the braking equipment (9)

embraces a free limb (2.2), which is provided with running surfaces (2.3),
of the guide rail (2), wherein a respective brake plate (12) carried by a

brake plate holder (12.1) is provided for each running surface (2.3) and
that at least one brake plate (12) is actuable by means of a brake cylinder

(14), wherein the brake cylinder (14) is loadable by means of a pressure
which is produced in a pressure medium by means of a pressure medium

equipment (17) and regulated by means of the regulating equipment (16).
Safety equipment according to claim 1, characterised thereby, that
the braking equipment (9) is guided by a fastening housing (6) arranged at

a carrier frame (4), wherein the fastening housing (6) displays recesses
(7), into which guides (8) of the braking equipment (9) engage.
Safety equipment according to claim 2, characterised thereby, that
elastic intermediate layers (10), at which the guides (8) of the braking

equipment (9) are so retained and guided that the braking equipment (9) is
capable of following deviations from verticality and tolerances of the

guide rail (2) during the braking operation, are arranged at the recesses
(7).
Safety equipment according to the claims 2 and 3, characterised
thereby, that the fastening housing (6) is arranged at an upper yoke (4.1)

of the carrier frame (4).
Safety equipment according to the claims 2 and 3, characterised
thereby, that the fastening housing (6) is arranged at a lower yoke (4.2)

of the carrier frame (4). 
Safety equipment according to claim 1, characterised thereby, that a
retardation sensor (26) is provided, which is arranged at the fastening

housing (6) and which in interaction with the regulating equipment (16)
keeps the retardation of the lift cage (3) at a predetermined value during

the braking operation.
Safety equipment according to claim 6, characterised thereby, that
the regulating equipment (16) is activatable by means of a speed sensor

(24) and an acceleration sensor (25) in the case of a fault.
Safety equipment according to claim 6, characterised thereby, that
the regulating equipment (16) is activatable by means of a lift control

(27) during the loading and unloading of the lift cage (3) and during
maintenance operations, wherein the lift control (27) is manually settable

into the respective operating state.
Safety equipment according to claim 1, characterised thereby, that
the pressure medium equipment (17), which stands in connection with the -

regulating equipment (16), comprises a motor (18), a pressure pump (19), a
pressure storage device (20), pressure switches (23.1, 23.2, 23.3, 23.4),

valves (21, 22, 22.1, 22.2, 22.3, 22.4) and pressure medium ducts (15),
wherein a pressure-regulating valve (22.1) controls the pressure medium led

to the brake cylinder (14).
Safety equipment according to claim 1, characterised thereby, that
the brake plate (12) displays a brake sensor (13) for monitoring the wear

of the brake plate (12).
Safety equipment according to claim 1, characterised thereby, that
the brake cylinder (14) displays a piston (14.2), which is arranged in a

cylinder chamber (14.1) and acts on the brake plate holder (12.1), for the
production of the braking force.
Safety equipment according to claim 11, characterised thereby, that
the brake cylinder (14) displays a compression spring (14.4) for the

production of the braking force, wherein the loading of the brake cylinder
(14) takes place against the compression spring (14.4).
