<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to an assembly of valves including a first valve and a second valve (100) which can move and pivot about one and the same axle, particularly two valves of a motor vehicle ventilation or air-conditioning installation. The valves are coupled together in terms of rotation by means of a connecting rod (200) inserted at its ends (210; 260) into respective housings (110; 160) of the first and second valves and interacting with these through positive engagement. The connecting rod (200) is made of plastic and has at least one first end (210) capable of deforming radially in an elastic manner when it is inserted into the respective housing (110) of the first valve, in order to be held therein through friction whilst retaining the possibility for axial displacement.
