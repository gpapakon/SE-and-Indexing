<ABSTRACT>
To sample liquids containing volatile materials, 
the liquid is pumped through a syringe needle (83) into a 

container (92) until the container (92) overflows. The needle (83) 
is removed slowly and the container (92) is automatically 

closed as the needle is withdrawn, wherein liquid 
flows upwardly continuously as the needle is 

withdrawn through an opening. The cap (90) for the 
container includes a closure having a valve (64) opening 

extending upwardly and sized to narrowly receive a 
syringe 
(83) in a perpendicular valve (64) member opening. 
The valve (64) member includes a flat member (99) on one end 

adapted to be gripped by a cam follower (60) for opening 
and closing of the valve (64) opening in coordination 

with the movement of the syringe (83).

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to methods and apparatus
for sampling liquids under conditions that maximize
precise analysis of ingredients.In one class of methods and apparatuses for
sampling liquids, the apparatus automatically draws
samples of known amounts of liquids at preprogrammed
intervals and deposits them into containers, which
are usually bottles. The prior art automatic
samplers of this class fill open containers. This
type of automatic sampler has a disadvantage if used
to sample liquids with volatile materials in them
because substantial amounts of the volatile
materials escape before measurement.Another class of sampler includes containers
that can be opened to receive liquid and closed
after filling without air space within them to
preserve as much of the volatile materials that are
within the liquid before being drawn as possible. A
prior art type of sampler of this class includes a
valve in an inlet conduit and a valve in an outlet
conduit. This type of valve has a disadvantage in
that it is difficult to automate because of the
number and types of valves, the size of the valves
and the size of the plumbing associated with the 
valves. A system of this type is disclosed in
United States Patents 4,974,456 and 4,864,877.It is one task of the invention to provide a
novel automatic liquid sampler that can preserve
representative samples of liquids having volatile
materials in them.To accomplish this task, a method of sampling
liquids comprises the steps of causing liquid to
flow through a needle into a container until the
container overflows and, after it overflows, closing
the container. It is characterized in that the
liquid is caused to flow through a needle into the
container and the needle is removed, after which the
container is closed automatically as the needle is
withdrawn. The liquid is caused to flow continuously as
the needle is withdrawn through an opening and the
opening is blocked with a valve. The valve is open
to the atmosphere for less than ten minutes.The valve is opened automatically with a narrow
clearance between the needle and valve just before
the needle enters the container to permit the needle
to pass through it, causing liquid to flow outwardly
from the needle and causing the liquid to continue
to flow as the needle is removed. The valve is
closed as soon as the needle clears the valve
opening whereby the liquid retains its volatile
material during sample. The liquid is caused to
flow from the needle laterally outwardly as the
needle is withdrawn. To open and close the
