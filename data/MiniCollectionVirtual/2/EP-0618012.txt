<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a flotation device, especially for the cleaning of fibrous suspensions in the paper industry, having an essentially rotationally-symmetrical separating part (1) for air bubbles with dirt particles taken up by them on the one hand and, on the other hand, fibres, and having, in particular, a tangential feed (2) and discharge (5) for cleaned suspension and a central dip tube (14) for the removal of dirt particles and air. The invention is characterised in that the inflow (2) is arranged at the bottom, the outflow (5) at the top and the separating part (1) tapers significantly upwards, the diameter ratio of the largest diameter (D1) to the smallest diameter (D2) (D1/D2) is between 1.2 and 3.

Floatation device, in particular for cleaning fibrous suspensions in the paper 
industry, with a rotationally symmetrical vertical separating element (1) for air 

bubbles with dirt particles attached thereto on the one hand and fibres on the 
other hand, which has in particular a tangential inlet (2) for the suspension air 

mixture and an outlet (5) for the cleaned suspension and a central immersion 
pipe (14) for removing dirt particles and air, characterised in that the inlet (2) is 

at the bottom and the outlet (5) at the top and the separating element (1) tapers 
towards the top, whereby the diameter ratio of the largest diameter (D
1
) to the 
smallest diameter (D
2
) (D
1
/D
2
) is between 1.2 and 3. 
Floatation device according to claim 1, characterised in that the diameter ratio 
(d) of the immersion pipe (14) to the smallest diameter (D
2
) of the separating 
element (1) (d/D
2
) is between 0.3 and 0.5. 
Floatation device according to claim 1 or 2, characterised in that the immersion 
depth (f) of the immersion pipe (14) in the separating element is 0,8 to 1,2 times 

the diameter (d) of the immersion pipe (14), whereby (d) is the outer diameter of 
the immersion pipe (14). 
Floatation device according to one of claims 1-3, characterised in that an inflow 
element (4) is provided which is cylindrical and has a diameter which is at least 

equal to the maximum diameter (D
1
) of the separating element (1). 
Floatation device according to one of claims 1-4, characterised in that an outflow 
element (3) is provided the diameter of which is at least 10 % greater than the 

minimum diameter (D
2
) of the separating element (1). 
Floatation device according to one of claims 1-5, characterised in that the inlet 
velocity of the suspension is between 0.5 and 5 m/s and the axial velocity 

component in the floatation device is between 0.1 and 1 m/s.
