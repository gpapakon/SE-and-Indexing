<ABSTRACT>
A tracking system and method that achieves track loop bandwidth reduction and 
analyzes scene information from an expanded area around a tracked 

target. Objects in 
the scene that may interfere with the target and cause degraded 

tracking performance are 
tracked (12) to determine the level of likely perturbation of a 

primary tracker (11) due to 
interference. The present invention predicts the time (37) at which 

interference due to clutter 
objects will occur and the estimated time duration of the interference. 

The present 
invention uses this information to determine and variably adjust (13) 

the bandwidth of a 
track loop to prevent track loss while detecting and tracking maneuvers 

of the target.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates generally to video tracking systems, and more
particularly, to an improved video tracking system that employs clutter detection
wherein target information and scene objects are used to automatically decrease the
system bandwidth to reduce perturbations from clutter during interference.Conventional video trackers detect clutter on a very local level and enter into a
"coast" state by setting the system bandwidth (gain) to zero for a period of time during
expected interference, using a previously computed target rate estimate to predict the
target position during the time period. Target maneuvers during a coast event may
cause the target to be lost irreparably.Kalman filters and extended Kalman filtering are used in some video tracking
systems to automatically change the system bandwidth (gain) according to changes in
target position measurements. Typical Kalman filters vary the bandwidth depending on
how well the target position measurements match dynamic model predictions. When
the match is good, the bandwidth is reduced, thus, measurements are weighted less.
When the match is poor, the bandwidth is increased and the model parameters are
updated for the new measurements. Unless the Kalman filter is augmented for predicted
interference, the filter updates the model parameters during the interference period,
exactly the opposite of what is desired. Thus, Kalman filters actually increase the
bandwidth during perturbations. Kalman filtering cannot estimate the length of the
interference, and must rely on target position measurements alone to drive the
bandwidth back to normal. In the PATENT ABSTRACTS OF JAPAN, VOL 16, NO 109 (P-1326),
17 March 1992 & JP-A-03 282 387 (Yamada) there is disclosed
a tracking processor with the object to prevent mistracking
and accurately track a real target by tracking a clutter
with clutter position information obtained by comparing
target position information with clutter prediction
position information in a clutter area.In this tracking processor a clutter area decision part
outputs target position data Ri and thetai, received from a
target data buffer, to a wake target correlation part when
the target position data Ri and thetai are outside the
preset clutter area or to a clutter tracking part when they
are inside the clutter area. A tracking part compares the
data Ri and thetai with the clutter prediction positions
Rcpi-1 and thetacpi-1 from a clutter tracking buffer, and
outputs target position data Xi and Yi as a clutter to a
clutter
