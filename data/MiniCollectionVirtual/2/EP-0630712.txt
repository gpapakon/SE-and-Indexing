<ABSTRACT>
An immersion nozzle, intended particularly for thin-slab casting, is divided into an upper section (6) and a lower section (7). In a longitudinal plane of section, the upper section (6) widens in the direction of the lower section (7). In a longitudinal plane of section perpendicular thereto, the upper section (6) tapers in the direction of the lower section (7). To simplify production and improve the replaceability of the sections, each of the sections (6, 7) is formed by at least one separate moulded brick (3, 4, 5). The moulded bricks (3, 4, 5) engage in one another at their mutually facing ends and are there provided with a seal (20).

Immersion nozzle, particularly for thin slab 
casting, which is divided into an upper and a lower 

section, the upper section broadening towards the 
lower section in one longitudinal sectional plane 

and tapering towards the lower section in a 
longitudinal sectional plane perpendicular thereto 

and the lower section defining an immersion zone, 
characterised in that each of the sections (6, 7) is 

constituted by at least one separate moulded brick 
(3, 4; 5), the moulded bricks (3, 4, 5) engaging 

within one another at their ends (10, 11; 15, 16) 
directed towards one another and a seal (20) being 

arranged between the engaging ends (10, 11; 15, 16) 
of the moulded bricks (3, 4, 5). 
Immersion nozzle as claimed in Claim 1, 
characterised in that the upper section (6) is 

defined by two separate moulded bricks (3, 4), one 
moulded brick (3) defining a tubular inlet passage 

(9) for the molten metal and the other moulded brick 
(4) defining a flow compartment (12), which tapers 

downwardly in one longitudinal sectional plane and 
broadens downwardly in a longitudinal sectional 

plane perpendicular thereto. 
Immersion nozzle as claimed in Claim 1 or 2, 
characterised in that the ends (10, 11; 15, 16) 

engage conically within one another. 
Immersion nozzle as claimed in one of the preceding 
claims, characterised in that the upper moulded  

 
brick (3, 4) engages in the lower moulded brick (4, 

5). 
Immersion nozzle as claimed in one of the preceding 
claims, characterised in that the lower moulded 

brick (5) defining the immersion zone (8) has 
longitudinal webs (17) in its flow cross-section 

(13). 
Immersion nozzle as claimed in one of the preceding 
claims, characterised in that the lower moulded 

brick (5) defines downwardly open outlet openings 
(18). 
Immersion nozzle as claimed in one of the preceding 
claims, characterised in that the lower moulded 

brick (5) defines opening edges (18', 19') extending 
obliquely to the horizontal. 
Immersion nozzle as claimed in one of the preceding 
claims, characterised in that the lower moulded 

brick (5) has outwardly projecting surfaces (25), 
below which a mounting device (26) may engage. 
Immersion nozzle as claimed in one of the preceding 
claims, characterised in that the seal (20) includes 

an annular passage (21) and compressible sealing 
rings (22, 23) adjacent and above and below it.
