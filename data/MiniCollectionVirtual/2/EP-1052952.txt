<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to intravascular stents, and more particularly to an
intravascular stent, which provides easy introduction through tortuous sections of
vessels but this invention can be used as an intraluminal scaffolding device in any
tubular body anatomy.Angioplasty, either coronary or general vascular, has advanced to become the
most effective means for revascularization of stenosed vessels. In the early 1980's,
angioplasty first became available for clinical practice in the coronary artery, and has
since proven an effective alternative to conventional bypass graft surgery. Balloon
catheter dependent angioplasty has consistently proven to be the most reliable and
practical interventional procedure. Other ancillary technologies such as laser based
treatment, or directional or rotational atherectomy, have proven to be either of limited
effectiveness or dependent on balloon angioplasty for completion of the intended
procedure. Restenosis following balloon-based angioplasty is the most serious
drawback and is especially prevalent in the coronary artery system.Many regimens have been designed to combat restenosis, with limited success,
including laser based treatment and directional or rotational atherectomy.
Intravascular stenting, however, noticeably reduces the restenosis rate following
angioplasty procedures. The procedure for intravascular stent placement typically
involves pre-dilation of the target vessel using balloon angioplasty, followed by
deployment of the stent, and expansion of the stent such that the dilated vessel walls
are supported from the inside.The intravascular stent functions as scaffolding for the lumen of a vessel. The
scaffolding of the vessel walls by the stent serve to: (a) prevent elastic recoil of the
dilated vessel wall, (b) eliminate residual stenosis of the vessel; a common occurrence
in balloon angioplasty procedures, (c) maintain the diameter of the stented vessel 
segment slightly larger than the native unobstructed vessel segments proximal and
distal the stented segment and (d) as indicated by the latest clinical data, lower the
restenosis rate. Following an angioplasty procedure, the restenosis rate of stented
vessels has proven significantly lower than for not stented or otherwise treated vessels;
treatments include drug therapy and other methods mentioned previously.Another benefit of vessel stenting is the potential reduction of emergency
bypass surgery arising from angioplasty procedures. Stenting has proven to be
effective in some cases for treating
