<ABSTRACT>
A protein containing one or more disulfide bonds, e.g., an antibody, is subjected to ultraviolet radiation to reduce one or more such bonds to reactive sulfhydryl groups; the resulting photoactivated protein is reacted with other chemical entity which is reactive with sulfhydryl, such as certain radiometals, chelating agents, drugs and toxins, so as to obtain a conjugate useful in, e.g., (in vitro) diagnosis, (in vivo) imaging, and therapy.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to the photoactivation of 
proteins by ultraviolet radiation, so that they may be reacted 
with other chemical entities, including radio-isotopes, to form 
useful conjugates. The conventional method of labeling antibodies with 
technetium (and similar radiometals) is to reduce the disulfide 
bonds of the antibody with a chemical reducing agent and then 
react the reduced antibodies with reduced pertechnetate. Chemical reducing agents are difficult to handle due to 
their susceptibility to oxidation. They may cause unwanted side 
reactions on proteins (for example, by reducing carbonyl groups), 
and it may be difficult to control the extent of the reduction 
reaction given the need to use strong reducing reagents. Prior to radiolabelling, the reduced antibodies must be 
separated from the remaining reducing reagent to stop the 
reaction, to remove potentially toxic substances (e.g., DTT, if 
used for reduction), and to avoid complexing technetium and 
thereby preventing it from labeling the protein. This 
purification process is time-consuming and may lead to loss of 
protein, or to re-oxidation of the protein. Since a source of reduced technetium is required for 
radiolabeling, a certain amount of reducing agent must be added 
back to either the reduced protein or to the technetium source 
itself. The latter implies that the labeling process is 
necessarily at least two steps. Rhodes, et al., J. Nucl. Med., 27:685 (1986 and Crockford 
and Rhodes, US 4,424,200 (1984) teach a method of labelling  
 
F(ab')2 fragments of antibodies with the radioisotope Tc-99m. 
The fragments were incubated overnight with stannous ions (e.g., 
SnCl2), a reducing agent, in a phthalate-tartrate buffer. This 
"pretinning" process converts the dimeric F(ab')2 to monomeric 
fragments through reduction of the disulfide bonds connecting the 
heavy chains. The fragments are then reacted with Tc-99m. Unfortunately, the Rhodes method has several disadvantages. 
First, it requires a high concentration of stannous ion to reduce 
the antibody. Nonetheless, Rhodes desires that about two-thirds 
of the stannous ions be oxidized in the reaction with the 
protein, the remainder serving to reduce the pertechnetate when 
it is added later. However, it is difficult to control the 
extent to which the stannous ions are involved in the reduction 
of the antibody. If too little stannous ion was provided, the 
pertechnetate will not be completely reduced by the residuum. 
If too much stannous ion was furnished, some

one or more disulfide bonds, and a partner chemical which is 

reactive with free thiol moieties, which comprises subjecting the
