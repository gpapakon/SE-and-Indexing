<ABSTRACT>
A dye-donor element for thermal dye transfer 
comprising a support having thereon at least one dye 

layer area comprising an image dye in a binder and 
another area comprising a transferable protection 

layer, the transferable protection layer area being 
approximately equal in size to the dye layer area and 

being less than 0.1 µm thick, wherein the transferable 
protection layer contains particles in an amount of up 

to about 75 % of the amount of said transferable 
protection layer.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a dye-donor element
for thermal dye transfer, and more particularly to the
use of particles in a transferable protection overcoat
in the element for transfer to a thermal print.In recent years, thermal transfer systems
have been developed to obtain prints from pictures
which have been generated electronically from a color
video camera. According to one way of obtaining such
prints, an electronic picture is first subjected to
color separation by color filters. The respective
color-separated images are then converted into
electrical signals. These signals are then operated on
to produce cyan, magenta and yellow electrical signals.
These signals are then transmitted to a thermal
printer. To obtain the print, a cyan, magenta or
yellow dye-donor element is placed face-to-face with a
dye-receiving element. The two are then inserted
between a thermal printing head and a platen roller. A
line-type thermal printing head is used to apply heat
from the back of the dye-donor sheet. The thermal
printing head has many heating elements and is heated
up sequentially in response to the cyan, magenta and
yellow signals. The process is then repeated for the
other two colors. A color hard copy is thus obtained
which corresponds to the original picture viewed on a
screen. Further details of this process and an
apparatus for carrying it out are contained in U.S.
Patent No. 4,621,271.Thermal prints are susceptible to retransfer
of dyes to adjacent surfaces and to discoloration by
fingerprints. This is due to dye being at the surface
of the dye-receiving layer of the print. These dyes
can be driven further into the dye-receiving layer by
thermally fusing the print with either hot rollers or a
thermal head. This will help to reduce dye retransfer 
and fingerprint susceptibility, but does not eliminate
these problems. However, the application of a
protective overcoat will practically eliminate these
problems.U.S. Patents 4,738,555, 4,666,320 and
5,332,713 and JP 4-52223 disclose a dye-donor element
for thermal dye transfer wherein a transparent ink
region is also present on the element which is used to
form a protective layer over the printed image.However, there is a problem with the above-described
materials used in protective overcoats,
especially when the overcoat is less than about 1 µm,
in that an iridescent pattern is produced which
degrades the appearance of an image when it is viewed
in reflected light. Elimination of this iridescence is
highly desirable for enhanced print quality.US-A-4738555
