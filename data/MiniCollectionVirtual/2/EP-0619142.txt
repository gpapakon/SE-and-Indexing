<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a silver catalyst having a silver content of 10 to 25% by mass for the partial oxidation of ethylene with molecular oxygen in the gas phase to give ethylene oxide and a process for the preparation of ethylene oxide with this catalyst. The catalyst, in which the silver is present in particles on a macroporous ceramic support, surpasses the comparable catalysts of the prior art as a result of increased selectivity (with high activity) and/or a more favourable ageing behaviour. The process for the preparation of ethylene oxide is distinguished by an improved economic efficiency. The average diameter of the silver particles is less than 0.4 times the number-average pore diameter of the untreated support.

A silver catalyst having a silver content of from 
10 to 25% by weight, based on the finished catalyst, for 

the partial oxidation of ethylene with molecular oxygen 
in the gas phase to form ethylene oxide, the silver being 

present in particles which are situated on a porous, 
nonacidic, heat resistant, ceramic support and have a 

number-average particle diameter from 0.05 to

 0.4 µm 
determined by scanning electron microscopy, characterized 

in that 

the support is macroporous, where the macroporosity 
is characterized by a pore volume having a lower 

limit of

determined by Hg porosimetry at a pressure rising to 

2000 bar, and with respect to the upper limit of the 
pore volume is characterized by the lateral fracture 

strength of the finished catalyst being not less 
than 20 N; 
the average diameter of the silver particles 
satisfies the additional condition of being less 

than 0.4 times the number-average pore diameter of

finished catalyst form essentially no silver 

bridges, so that the finished catalyst behaves like 
an insulator with high electrical resistance.
