<ABSTRACT>
An epoxy resin composition which exhibits a low dielectric 
constant and a low dielectric dissipation factor as well as 

an excellent working susceptibility after its curing is 
provided. The epoxy resin composition contains at least one 

of a novolak resin (A) obtainable by condensing formalin or 
paraformaldehyde or both with an alkylphenol compound; and an 

epoxy resin (B) prepared by glycidylating said novolak resin 
(A) with an epihalohydrin.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to an epoxy resin composition having
a low dielectric constant and a
low dielectric dissipation factor as well as an excellent
working susceptibility after curing.Recent widening in the applications of electric and
electronic components are remarkable, and nowadays a large
number of electric and electronic components are used not
only in computers but also in automatic control,
communication, business and games machines and equipment.
In packaging such electric and electronic components,
printed wiring boards are used to construct an electric or
electronic circuit. A laminate comprising a stack of
several sheets of prepregs impregnated with an epoxy resin
is used in the construction of the printed wiring boards.Due to miniaturization and the improvement in the
performance of electronic equipment, there is a strong
demand for the laminates to have a lower dielectric
constant. Increase in the operational speed of a computer has
been realized by use of a fine circuit pattern at a
higher density. Such efforts, however, are facing their
physical limit, and there is a serious demand to
decrease the dielectric loss of the insulating laminate
consequently to enable an increase in the operational speed. The laminate used as a circuit substrate in satellite
communications also needs to have a lower dielectric
dissipation factor in order to decrease transmission loss,
and a material for the laminate needs to have a lower
dielectric constant in order to enable fabrication of a
circuit of an appropriate size.In view of such a situation, various attempts have
been made to use polyethylene resins and fluoroplastics as
a material for fabricating the laminate.However, the laminates fabricated by using such a
polyethylene resin or fluoroplastic suffer from defects
such as:
(1) an insufficient moldability leading to a high
temperature in molding;(2) a poor dimensional stability; and(3) a lower adhesion with the overlying copper
cladding.Alternatively, the dielectric dissipation factor of
the laminate can be decreased by using a quartz material
instead of the glass material used for fabricating the
laminate. The thus produced laminates, however, suffer
from a faster drill abrasion upon working, and in
particular, upon drilling of the laminate.In view of such a situation, the present
invention seeks to provide an epoxy resin composition which
has a low dielectric constant and a low dielectric 
dissipation factor after curing, and which also has an
excellent working susceptibility after curing.Polymers
