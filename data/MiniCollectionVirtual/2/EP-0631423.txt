<ABSTRACT>
The videotext unit (10) interfaces via a telephone line (31) to a central unit (30). The videotext unit has a keyboard (12) which commands the display of videotext on a screen (11) translating digital words via a modem (13) to text. An additional processor (20) is added to the unit. This processor stores the incoming information. The computer processor can also operate as a stand alone unit, and stores the information as a family tree, with a series of extracts from the text, allowing the user to lock up information on a topic and access it easily, via a pointer control (16). Information on the screen can be printed to a printer.
