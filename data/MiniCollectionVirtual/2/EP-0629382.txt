<ABSTRACT>
A medical probe device comprises a catheter (14) having a 
stylet guide (16) housing with one or more stylet ports (40) in a side 

wall thereof and a stylet guide for directing a flexible 
stylet (17) outward through the stylet port and through 

intervening tissue at a preselected, adjustable angle to a 
target tissue. The total catheter assembly includes a 

stylet guide lumen (61) communicating with the stylet port and a 
stylet positioned in said stylet guide lumen for 

longitudinal movement from the port through intervening 
tissue to a target tissue. The stylet can be an electrical 

conductor enclosed within a non-conductive layer, the 
electrical conductor being a radiofrequency electrode (38). 

Preferably, the non-conductive layer is a sleeve (60) which is 
axially moveable on the electrical conductor to expose a 

selected portion of the electrical conductor surface in the 
target tissue. The stylet can also be a microwave antenna (66). 

The stylet can also be a hollow tube for delivering 
treatment fluid to the target tissue. It can also include a 

fiber optic cable for laser treatment. The catheter can 
include one or more inflatable balloons (30,32) located adjacent to 

the stylet port for anchoring the catheter or dilation. 
Ultrasound transponders and temperature sensors can be 

attached to the probe end and/or stylet. The stylet guide 
can define a stylet path from an axial orientation in the 

catheter through a curved portion to a lateral orientation 
at the stylet port.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention is directed to a unique device and
method for penetrating body tissues for medical purposes
such as tissue destruction and fluid substance delivery, for
example. The device penetrates tissue to the precise target
selected in order to deliver energy to the tissue and/or
deliver substances. It limits this activity to the precise
preselected site, thereby minimizing trauma to normal
surrounding tissue and achieving a greater medical benefit.
This device is a catheter-like device for positioning a
treatment assembly in the area or organ selected for medical
treatment with one or more stylets in the catheter, mounted
for extension from a stylet port in the side of the catheter
through surrounding tissue to the tissue targeted for
medical activity.Treatment of cellular tissues usually requires direct
contact of target tissue with a medical instrument, usually
by surgical procedures exposing both the target and
intervening tissue to substantial trauma. Often, precise
placement of a treatment probe is difficult because of the
location of a target tissue in the body or the proximity of
the target tissue to easily damaged, critical body organs,
nerves, or other components.Benign prostatic hypertrophy or hyperplasia (BPH), for
example, is one of the most common medical problems
experienced by men over 50 years old. Urinary tract
obstruction due to prostatic hyperplasia has been recognized
since the earliest days of medicine. Hyperplastic
enlargement of the prostate gland often leads to compression
of the urethra, resulting in obstruction of the urinary
tract and the subsequent development of symptoms including
frequent urination, decrease in urinary flow, nocturia,
pain, discomfort, and dribbling. The association of BPH 
with aging has been shown to exceed 50% in men over 50 years
of age and increases in incidence to over 75% in men over 80
years of age. Symptoms of urinary obstruction occur most
frequently between the ages of 65 and 70 when approximately
65% of men in this age group have prostatic enlargement.Currently there is no proven effective nonsurgical
method of treatment of BPH. In addition, the surgical
procedures available are not totally satisfactory. Currently
patients suffering from the obstructive symptoms of
this disease are provided with few options: continue to cope
with the symptoms (i.e., conservative management), submit to
drug therapy at early stages, or submit to surgical
intervention. More than 430,000 patients per year undergo
surgery for removal of prostatic tissue in the
