<ABSTRACT>
Device for winding a wrapping film around an
article (1) to be packaged, said article to be packaged

having the shape of a substantially flat rectangle
in cross-section. The article to be packaged comprises

two substantially parallel broad sides (2, 3) and two
narrow sides (4,5), the edges between the broad and

narrow sides forming supporting points (6) for the
wrapping film. The device comprises a film distributor

(7) disposed to travel along a ring-like endless track
(8) at a substantially constant speed around the article

to be packaged. The track (8) of the film distributor
(7) is so formed that the track radius (r)

from the track to the supporting point (6) increases
continuously at least in the track area (S) where the

film portion (12) drawn from the roll in the direction
of the radius and stretched between the film distributor

and the supporting point (6) approaches a position
parallel to at least one broad side (2; 3) of the article

being packaged, said position corresponding to a
point (0) where a straight line in the direction of

said broad side intersects the track (8), so that,
when said point (0) is being approached and at said

point, a tangent (T) to the track is at a smaller
angle to the straight line in the direction of the

broad side than a tangent to an imaginary circular
path, the rate of increase of the radius (r) at least

in said area of the track and the rate of delivery of
film from the film roll (9) being higher than if the

track followed the imaginary circular path mentioned.
At and after said point (0) on the track, the rate of

increase of the radius (r) remains substantially the
same as before point (0), with no substantial changes

occurring in the rate of increase of the radius.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a device as
defined in the preamble of claim 1.In prior art, a device for winding a wrapping
film around an article to be packaged is known. The
device comprises a film distributor which is disposed
to rotate along a ring-like endless track at a substantially
constant speed around the article to be
packaged and which comprises a removable and replaceable
film roll, supporting elements to support the
film roll on the film distributor and a tensioning device
to retard film delivery and to achieve a proper
film tension. Usually the track is of a circular form.When the article to be packaged has the shape
of a substantially flat rectangle in cross-section and
the cross-sectional form thus comprises two broad sides
parallel to each other and two narrow sides parallel
to each other, a circular distributor track causes
problems because the film is slackened when laid on
the broad side. This is due to the fact that, since
the article being wrapped is of a flat shape, its
broad surface lies very close to the diameter of the
circle. The corner edge between the broad and narrow
sides constitutes a supporting point for the wrapping
film when the film is being wound around the article.
Thus, during the wrapping operation, the film, which
extends between said supporting point and the film
distributor, is no longer stretched when it approaches
the direction of the diameter of the circle, in other
words, the rate of film delivery is reduced to almost
nil as the radius from the supporting point to the
track is not increasing. Therefore, the film is
slackened before it is laid onto the broad side. Typically,
the film on the broad side is creased and the
wrapping is not tight. Film tightness on the narrow 
side is no problem, but a problem is encountered in
the fact that the rate of film delivery increases from
nearly zero to a relatively high level when the narrow
side is reached, and the film distributor should be
able to adjust itself to this change. Thus, the problem
with winding a wrapping film around an object of
the shape indicated is the large variation in the rate
of film delivery.A new application in wrapping technology is
the wrapping up of bundles of steel sheets and rolls
of steel band in plastic sheeting. So far, these articles
have been manually wrapped in paper, which has
been a difficult and expensive job, which is why it is
now becoming common practice to wrap them in plastic.
If the layers of plastic wrapping remain loose, moisture
will penetrate between and under the
