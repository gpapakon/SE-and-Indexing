<ABSTRACT>
An apparatus for recording and reproducing an encoded 
video signal from a source encoder comprises a decoder for 

performing a decoding process for the encoded video signal to 
produce a decoded video signal, an encoder block for 

compressing the decoded video signal using a spatial 
correlation to produce an intra mode compression signal, a 

buffer memory for storing the intra mode compression signal, 
a mode controller for generating a clock pulse used to read 

out data in the buffer memory in accordance with a longer 
playing time recording and a normal playing time recording and 

a recording and reproducing unit for recording and reproducing 
the intra mode compression signal read from the buffer memory.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an apparatus for recording and
reproducing a digital video signal according to the preamble of
claim 1.As is well known, a digital video tape recorder("VTR")
records and reproduces a video signal in a digital form. The
digital video signal may be a pulse code modulated ("PCM")
signal which is obtained by performing a sampling operation on
the video signal in such a manner that satisfies the so-called
Nyquist condition. The digital VTR of the type described above
is disclosed in an article entitled, "Digital Video Recording
Techniques Using 1/2" Metal particle Tape" by S. Mita et al.,
IEEE Consumer Electronics, 386-397 (August, 1985).In addition, there is proposed a digital VTR for
compressing a digital video signal by employing a high-efficiency
coding technique based on Hadamard transformation
in order to elongate the recording and reproducing time per
unit length of a recording tape (see C. Yamamitsu et al., "High 
Density Recording and Bit Rate Reduction for a 2-hour Digital
VTR", Video Audio & Data Recording, 113-120 (March 1986)).
However, the digital VTR proposed by Yamamitsu is silent on
the possibility or mechanism of compressing a digital video
signal in a standard playing mode or a longer playing mode.U.S. Patent No. 4,963,992 issued to Nobukazu Doi et al.
discloses an apparatus for recording/reproducing a digital
video signal in both standard and extended playing modes
through the use of a sub-Nyquist sampling operation. The
apparatus comprises a first and a second sub-Nyquist sampling
circuits, each of which samples the digital video signal to
produce a first and a second sampled signals which do not
define the same data within the digital video signal. Both the
first and the second sampled signals are combined and recorded
in a standard mode while either the first or the second
sampled signal is selected and then recorded in the extended
playing mode.While the Doi patent provides an improved recording and
reproducing apparatus over the Yamamitsu system, it requires
two signal paths through which both the first and the second
sampled signals are passed, thereby complicating its signal
processing.The document IEEE Transactions on Consumer Electronics, vol.
34, no. 3, August 1988, pp. 597-605, S. Borgers et al.: "An
experimental digital VCR with 40 mm drum, single actuator and
DCT-based bit-rate reduction" shows the features of the
preamble of claim 1. In contrast to the invention this document
does not show a mode controller for selecting recording
speed/playin

video signal supplied from a source encoder, which

comprises:

a) means for decoding the enclosed video signal to
produce a decoded video signal defining a sequence

of frames;
b) means for encoding the decoded video signal using
an intraframe correlation to produce an intra

mode compression signal, said encoding means
including


b1) an intra mode transformer for transforming
the decoded video signal into a set of intra

mode transform coefficients;
b2) an intra mode quantizer for quantizing the
set of intra mode transform coefficients

using a quantization step size to produce
an intra mode quantization signal; and
b3) a variable length coder for coding the intra
mode quantization signal to produce the

recording mode selection signal;
g) wherein said mode controller includes

g1) a first clock generator for generating a
first clock pulse having a first clock frequency 

for the normal playing time;
g2) a second clock generator for generating a
second clock pulse having a second clock

frequency for the longer playing time; and
