<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention refers to a teletext signals receiver, 
in particular incorporated within a television signals 
receiver. The transmission of teletext signals, i.e. the transmission 
of data in a digital form , inserted in a television signal 
is well known. It is also known how important it is to reduce the number of 
errors during the reception of teletext signals, in 
particular during very long transmissions, as is the case of 
"telesoftware" or "datavideo". The teletext transmission is realised in packets of 42 "byte" 
each, inserted in some of the television lines during the 
frame return; for simplicity for herein on such lines shall 
be indicated with the term "teletext lines". Every teletext line transports the information of 42 "byte"; 
this information is preceded by 3 byte, more precisely 
constituted by 2 "run-in" byte and by 1 "framing code" byte. The "run-in" constitutes the information for the correct 
synchronisation of the "clock" of the receiver; the "framing 
code" constitutes the key for understanding whether a line is 
transporting teletext information or not; it is therefore  
 
extremely important that this is detected without errors. The position of the "framing code" within a teletext line is 
unfortunately not fixed, but depends on various variable 
factors, such as: 
tolerances that are different from one broadcaster to the 
next; group delay presented by the tuner used in the television 
receiver; circuit tolerances that provide for extracting the teletext 
signals from the video signal ("data slicer"); differences in the locking points of the PLL circuit (Phase 
Locked Loop) of the receiver; etc. It is therefore usual that the known receivers open a 
temporal window of a size sufficient to take into 
consideration all the aforementioned tolerances; 
unfortunately this leads to the consequence of a greater 
probability of errors in the decoding of the "framing code" 
and, as a result, in the reception of the teletext signal. The aim of the present invention is that of indicating how it 
is possible to reduce such error probability and as a result 
improve the correct reception characteristics of the signals. 
For reaching such aims the present invention has as its 
subject a teletext signals receiver, in particular 
incorporated within a television signals receiver, 
characterised in that it provides a detecting circuit of the 
position of the "Framing code". Further characteristics and advantages of the present 
invention shall result in being clear from the following

<CLAIMS>
Teletext signals receiver, in particular incorporated 
within a television signals receiver, characterised in that 

it provides a detecting circuit of the position of the 
Framing code. 
Teletext signals receiver, according to claim 1, 
characterised in that it provides for opening an exact 

temporal window on the "framing code", of slightly larger 
dimensions than the "framing code" itself. 
Teletext signals receiver, according to claim 2, 
characterised in that said window has the maximum amplitude 

of 8 microseconds. 
Teletext signals receiver, according to claim 2, 
characterised in that the said window has the amplitude of 

approximately 1,5 microseconds. 
Teletext signals receiver, according to claim 4, 
characterised in that the said window is positioned on the 

effective "framing code" with a precision of approximately 
500 nanoseconds. 
Teletext signals receiver, according to claim 5, 
characterised in that the said window is positioned on the 

final bit of the "framing code" with a precision of 500 
nanoseconds. 
Teletext signals receiver, according to claim 1, 
characterised in that the said detecting circuit of the 

position of the "Framing code" is activated several times the 
moment in which the teletext reception is selected, to then 

be switched off upon the next selection of a station that 
transmits teletext signals. 
Teletext signals receiver, according to claim 2, 
characterised in that it comprises a microprocessor for 

controlling the positioning of the window. 
Teletext signals receiver, according to claim 1, 
characterised in that it comprises a board inserted in a 

personal computer. 
Teletext signals receiver, according to claim 2, 
characterised in that the positioning of said window takes 

place with respects to the initial front of the line 
synchronism signal. 
Teletext signals receiver, according to claim 2, 
characterised in that the positioning of said window takes 

place by detecting the instant in which the final bit of the 
"framing code" is read.
