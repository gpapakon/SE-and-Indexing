<ABSTRACT>
An LC-type dielectric filter and a duplexer 
are disclosed. The filter (10) comprises a multilayer 

substrate. Each layer (2, 4 and 6) has a strip 
line resonator (21, 41 and 61). The filter has a 

plurality of terminals (11, 12 and 13) which are 
connected to each of the resonators. The terminals 

are capacitively or inductively coupled to each other. 
The filter further comprises at least one grounding 

layer (3, 5) for electrically insulating the 
resonators. 
Overcoupling between the resonators can be 
obtained by forming a plurality of resonators on the 

same substrate closely. Further, a duplexer having 
this type of filter can be formed. The duplexer 

additionally has a matching circuit and has a power 
amplifier for RF transmission.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a band-pass filter 
and in particular to a band-pass filter formed by a 
plurality of LC-type resonators on a dielectric 
substrate. Such filters are used in, for example, 
portable telephones or mobile telephone terminals. 
The invention also relates to a duplexer using such an 
LC-type dielectric filter. The dielectric filter used as a band-pass 
filter is used in mobile or portable telephone 
subscriber terminals. A typical conventional 
dielectric filter comprises a substantially 
rectangular dielectric block. A plurality of 
resonators extend from a top surface to a bottom 
surface of the dielectric block. Such a dielectric 
filter is disclosed in United States Patent No. 
4,431,977, "Ceramic Band Pass Filter" or Japanese 
Koukoku publication No. 62-57122, "Dielectric Filter". 
Such types of dielectric filter need a plurality of 
resonant holes, and the inner surface of the 
respective resonant holes has to be metallised. 
Another known type of band-pass filter has a 
dielectric substrate, strip line resonators disposed 
on the substrate, and a coupling circuit to connect 
between the resonators. Such type of filter is 
disclosed in Japanese Laid-Open Patent No. 62-164301, 
or No. 3-173201. To manufacture this type of filter, 
a similar process to printed-circuit-board-manufacturing 
process can be adopted. Accordingly, 
compared to the rectangular type of dielectric filter, 
it is easier to manufacture. Further, this type of 
filter is suitable to manufacture small-sized filter. 
However, because a plurality of resonators are on the 
same dielectric substrate, floating capacitance can 
occur between each resonator, and thus the stability  
 
of the coupling circuit becomes poor. The present invention seeks to provide a 
small-sized LC-type dielectric filter which can 
prevent occurrence of floating capacitance between 
each resonator. The invention further seeks to provide a 
small-sized duplexer using the LC-type dielectric 
filter. Therefore, as briefly described, the present 
invention is an LC-type dielectric filter comprising a 
multi-layer substrate formed by a plurality of 
dielectric layers and at least one grounding layer, 
each of dielectric layer having a resonator and the 
grounding layer is disposed between the plurality of 
dielectric plates; an input terminal and an output 
terminal, each is disposed on the substrate, and a 
coupling circuit for coupling between each of the 
resonators. In order that the invention may be better 
understood, several
