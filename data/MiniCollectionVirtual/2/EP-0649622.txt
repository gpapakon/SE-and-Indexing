<ABSTRACT>
A pasta cooker (10) which includes an open water tank (12) shaped 
to receive pasta for cooking, a heater (44) for boiling water in the 

tank, a trough (58) positioned to receive and collect starch foam from 
an upper surface of the water in tank, and a drain (78) for draining 

water from the trough and tank, the drain including a screen box (76) 
for filtering pasta particles and starch foam from drained water to 

prevent clogging of drains downstream of the screen box. The 
trough (58) is coextensive with a front upper edge of the water tank (12), 

and the cooker includes a water fill valve which is actuatable to 
fill the tank such that a small amount of water continuously washes 

over from the tank into the trough during the cooking of pasta, 
thereby conveying starch foam floating on the upper surface of the 

water of the tank to the trough. The screen box (76) includes a 
removable drawer having perforated sides and positioned to receive 

the water and starch foam drained the from the trough and tank. 
The drawer is positioned within a housing shaped to collect water 

flowing through the drawer, and to receive water which overflows 
from the drawer in the event that the drawer becomes completely 

clogged. The screen box (76) includes a downwardly and rearwardly 
sloping floor (156) to direct drained water toward a rear opening (194) 

connected to a conventional drain pipe (196). The pasta cooker 
preferably includes a second tank, also draining into a screen box, 

for washing cooked pasta. The second tank also includes a flexible 
spray nozzle for cleaning both tanks and washing cooked pasta.

<DESCRIPTION>
THE PRESENT INVENTION relates to cooking devices, and more 
particularly, devices designed for boiling pasta in 
commercial quantities. Traditionally, the commercial preparation of pasta 
involved the boiling of pasta in large pots on a gas stove, 
or alternatively, the boiling of pasta in large pans on a 
gas stove, the pans including apparatus for tilting the pan 
to pour out its contents. However, with the advent of 
high-volume commercial food establishments which serve 
pasta, there is need for devices which are designed 
exclusively for boiling pasta on a continuous and high-volume 
basis. An initial attempt at developing such a device 
consisted of the conversion of a deep fat fryer. With that 
device, the tank for holding cooking oil was converted into 
a water holding tank, and pasta was placed in baskets 
positioned within the tank and cooked while the water in 
the tank was boiled. Such converted devices possess inherent 
disadvantages. For example, as a result of the continuous 
cooking of pasta, the water in the tank quickly became 
clogged with starch foam, making it difficult to observe 
the cooking of the pasta, and increasing the amount of time 
required for cleaning. Further, the tank drains tended to 
become clogged easily with starch foam and pasta particles,  
 
which become extremely sticky when deposited on metal 
surfaces, such as the stainless steel of the drain 
openings. FR-A-2 400 347 discloses a pasta cooker 
according to the preamble of claim 1 
having a 
tank for boiling water and means for draining water from 
the tank. A filter is provided which filters starch in the 
water drained from the tank. The filtered water is 
recycled into the tank. Starch accumulated in the filter 
is discharged directly through a waste outlet. Accordingly, there is a need for a pasta cooker 
which is capable of preparing pasta on a high-volume basis 
in which the problems of starch foam and drain clogging are 
minimized. One embodiment of the present invention comprises 
a pasta cooker having an open water tank having a heating 
mechanism and shaped to receive a basket of pasta to be 
cooked, a trough positioned adjacent to the upper edge of 
the tank, and a screen box connected to the trough and tank 
drains. The trough preferably is coextensive with the 
upper edge of the front wall of the tank and, during 
cooking of the pasta, the water level is adjusted such that 
a small amount of water from the upper surface of the tank 
washes over from the tank into the trough, carrying with it 
the

<CLAIMS>
A screen box for use with a pasta cooker of a type 
having a tank (12) for boiling water in which pasta is 

cooked, means (164) for draining water from said tank (12) 
and a screen for filtering water drained from the tank 

(12), which screen box (76) is characterized in that:
 
   a housing (144) is provided having first means 

(166) for receiving a drain hose (80) from the tank (12) 
and the screen is shaped to be inserted into and supported 

within the housing (144), the screen comprising a plurality 
of walls (182-186) defining a drawer (146) having an open 

top, at least one of the walls (182-186) being made of a 
perforated material, the first receiving means (166) being 

arranged to direct starch-laiden drain water from the drain 
hose (80) through the open top of the drawer (146), whereby 

said drain water flows through said perforated material and 
starch is retained thereon in the drawer (146). 
The screen box (76) of Claim 1, wherein said 
housing (144) includes a floor (156) inclined downwardly 

toward a drain opening (194) positioned at an end of said 
floor (156). 
The screen box (76) of Claim 1 or 2 wherein said 
housing (144) includes second means (164) for receiving 

another drain hose (74) from said tank (12), said second 
receiving means (164) being arranged to direct water
