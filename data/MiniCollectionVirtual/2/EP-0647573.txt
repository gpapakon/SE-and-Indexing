<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to
an assembly according to the preamble of claim 1 where
containers
preferably for collecting rubbish are able to be
emptied by means of one or more robot arms on a garbage
truck.Independently standing rubbish containers which
are emptied by lifting them up by robot arms are known.
These are mainly light, synthetic containers which are to be
placed on the pavement by the user shortly before the
garbage truck comes along. It goes without saying that the
maximum capacity of the container is determined by the
maximum lifting force of the robot arm.Rust-resistant metal containers are also known.
When such a container, of relatively low weight, for
instance of about 100-150 kg (excluding contents) is placed
on the street, it can be easily displaced, stolen,
vandalized and/or tipped over by hooligans. Accordingly
rubbish in the container would be spilt onto the street to
cause an eye-sore as well as possible health hazards. In
some cases a container made of rust-resistant metal is
considered to be an eye-sore on its own. When such a metal
container is damaged by vandals, this disagreeable sight is
further increased.In some areas, rubbish bags are still loaded into
the garbage truck by hand. Hence the profession of garbage
collector is still laborious and unhealthy.European patent application 0 432 306 relates to a
prior art assembly according to the preamble of claim 1 and
comprising a
poster-column container having an inner cylinder body for
collecting old glass, used paper, used batteries and such
waste.The present invention provides
an apparatus comprising: 
at least one container having at least one
compartment for the collecting of rubbish provided with
engaging means for engaging a robot arm and
having a front wall, a rear wall, side walls, a bottom and
an upper side;an envelope for the container, said envelope
being securable to the ground;the container and the envelope being provided
with cooperating means for guiding the container upwardly
out of and downwardly in the envelope upon raising or
lowering thereof and for keeping it in the correct position
with respect to the envelope; the assembly being
characterized in that the envelope is formed by a back wall
and sidewalls with an open top and front side, the front
wall of the container being provided with the robot arm
engaging means, whereby a robot arm is able to engage said
engaging means through the open front side of the envelope
and to raise said container out of the envelope before
tilting it. One or more of the

<CLAIMS>
Assembly (34, 101) comprising:

at least one container (35, 100) having at least one
compartment for the collecting of rubbish provided with

engaging means (43, 50, 103) for engaging a robot arm and
having a front wall, a rear wall, side walls, a bottom wall and

an
upper side;
an envelope (1, 80) for the container (35, 100), said envelope
(1, 80) being securable to the ground;
the container (35, 100) and the envelope (1, 80) being
provided with cooperating means for guiding the container

upwardly out of and downwardly in the envelope (1, 80) upon
raising or lowering thereof and for keeping it in the

correct position with respect to the envelope (1, 80); the
assembly (34, 101) being 
characterized in that
 the envelope
(1, 80) is formed by a back wall (2, 90) and sidewalls (3, 4, 91, 89)

with an open top and front side, the front wall of the
container being provided with the robot arm engaging

means (43, 50, 103), whereby a robot arm is able to engage said
engaging means through the open front side of the

envelope and to raise said container (35, 100) out of the
envelope (1, 80) before tilting it.
Assembly (101) according to claim 1, wherein
the co-operating means comprise an envelope frame part

(111) extending between the side-walls (91-89) of the
envelope (80) opposite the back wall (90) of the envelope

(80).
Assembly according to claim 1 or 2, wherein
the co-operating means for guiding the container into and

out of the envelope comprise at least one slot (8, 9) on
the inner side of the envelope and at least one

projecting part (46, 47) on the outer side of the
container, which is guidable in the slot (8, 9) wherein 

the slot is V-like in shape and the V-shape narrows in a
downwards direction.
Assembly according to claims 1, 2 or 3,
wherein the walls (89, 90, 91) of the envelope are

mounted in a steel frame.
Assembly according to claim 4, wherein the
frame is secured on a concrete foot (81).
Assembly according to claim 5, wherein the
container walls comprise releasable panels (89, 90, 91)

which are releasable from the frame.
Assembly according to any of the preceding
claims wherein the co-operating means comprise one or

more ears (108) mounted to each side wall of the
container.
Assembly according to any of the preceding
claims wherein the co-operating means comprise a nose

(109) on the rear wall of the envelope.
