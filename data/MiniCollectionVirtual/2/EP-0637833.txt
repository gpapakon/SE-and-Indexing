<ABSTRACT>
By selecting the number of apertures in the shadow mask of a colour 
cathode ray tube to be in the range between 690 and 770, such a cathode ray tube can 

be used both in a PAL and an NTSC system without the occurrence of disturbing Moiré 
effects.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a colour cathode ray tube comprising an electron
gun for generating at least one electron beam, a colour selection electrode having rows
of apertures, a display screen and means for deflecting the electron beam across the
colour selection electrode in a line deflection direction transverse to the row of
apertures.Such display devices are known from e.g. EP 0 321 202. They are used, inter alia, in television
receivers.A disturbing effect which may occur in such display devices is the so-called
Moiré effect. This effect causes light and dark lines or lines of a deviating colour
in the image.In operation, lines are written on the display screen in the line deflection
direction by the electron beam(s). The number of lines written on the display screen
(the so-called number of active lines) is system-dependent. In PAL and SECAM systems
approximately 540 lines are written on the display screen, (in these systems the signal
comprises 625 lines; approximately 50 of said lines are used for coded information; of
the remaining 575 lines approximately 7% is scanned beside the display screen, the so-called
"overscan"; thus, the overall number of active lines is approximately (625 -
50)/1.07 = 537). In the NTSC system approximately 450 active lines are written (the
NTSC signal comprises 525 lines). For so-called HDTV applications of these systems
the number of lines is doubled to, respectively, 1250 and 1050 in the signal and
approximately 1040 and 900 active lines. In operation, a colour cathode ray tube
preferably does not exhibit disturbing Moiré effects for "normal" display or HDTV-display,
irrespective of whether such a tube is used in a PAL, SECAM or NTSC
system.It is an object of the invention to provide a colour cathode ray tube which
can be used in several systems and in which no disturbing Moiré effect occurs.To this end, the colour cathode ray tube in accordance with the invention 
is characterized in that the number of apertures per row ranges between 690 and 780.Hitherto, "standard" systems customarily have in the order of 500 to 600
apertures per row. In this range (≈ 500-600) Moiré effects can be avoided for a
specific application or system but for other applications or systems such colour cathode
ray tubes exhibit very disturbing Moiré effects. The colour cathode ray tube in
accordance with the invention does not exhibit such disturbing Moiré effects. By virtue
thereof, a substantial saving in costs can be achieved.Within the range from 690 to 770, there are a number of
