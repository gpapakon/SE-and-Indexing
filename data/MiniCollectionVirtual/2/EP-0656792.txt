<ABSTRACT>
A dressing for dosing one or more medicaments and comprising at least one medicament containing layer (2, 2a, 2b) and a barrier layer (1, 1a, 1b) arranged between the medicament containing layer and the release face (6, 6a), said barrier layer consisting of a continuous hydrophobic phase and a discontinuous hydrophilic phase which is dispersed therein and which is water soluble or water swellable. Desired medicament release rates and release profiles within very wide limits may be obtained with the dressing.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention concerns a dressing containing one 
or more active medicaments for controlled release. Various bandages or dressings of this type are known, 
consisting of 
(a) A non-adhesive water-tight film, foam or the like 
arranged on the side of the bandage which is not 
intended to face the patient's skin. (b) A layer of an adhesive material consisting of a continuous 
phase containing an adhesive and e.g. composed 
of an elastomer, a plasticizer for elastomers, a 
tackifying resin and optionally an oil-based extender 
as well as an antioxidant, and optionally one or more 
water soluble or water swellable hydrocolloids, such 
as starch or cellulose derivatives or other hydrophilic 
polymers, as well as medicaments, such as antiseptics, 
antibiotics and antiinflammatory agents. (c) A removable release layer. Such bandages, which are primarily intended for use on 
wounded skin areas, are known e.g. from EP Patent Applications 
Nos. 92999 and 122344 as well as from the applicant's 
own DK Patent No. 154 806. Other bandages of a similar type, but which are also used 
for transcutaneous medication, are known from US Patent 
No. 4 904 247 and from EP Patent Application No. 186019. With the exception of the bandage known from DK Patent No. 
154 806, it is not possible to control or regulate the  
 
release of medicament from the bandages mentioned above. Thus, in the use of these known bandages the initial 
release will be very great, following which the release of 
the medicaments decreases evenly. The adhesive layer of the bandage described in DK Patent 
No. 154 806 consists of a continuous water insoluble phase 
and a discontinuous phase which is dispersed in it and 
which is water soluble or water swellable, said discontinuous 
phase incorporating the medicament. Thus, the incorporated 
medicament will be released in step with the solution 
or swelling of liquid in the discontinuous phase, and 
there is thus no control of the release of the medicament. However, a great initial release and a following declining 
release of the medicament can still be observed when the 
bandage is used on exuding wounds, and in particular if 
the wounds are very exuding. Such a release profile is desired in some situations, but 
in other situations another release profile is desired, 
such as release of a constant amount of the medicament per 
unit of time or delayed release. Furthermore, US Patent Specification No. 4 904 247 
describes a liquid absorbing wound bandage comprising an 
adhesive absorbing layer

<CLAIMS>
A dressing for dosing one or more medicaments and 
comprising at least one medicament containing layer (2, 

2a, 2b) and a barrier layer (1, 1a, 1b) arranged between 
the medicament containing layer and the release face (6, 

6a),
characterized
 in that the barrier layer 
consists of a continuous hydrophobic phase and a discontinuous 

hydrophilic phase which is dispersed therein 
and which is water soluble or water swellable. 
A dressing according to claim 1, 
characterized
 
in that it additionally comprises a water-tight 

top layer (3) which is preferably water vapour permeable, 
and that the product is adhesive, either in that the 

hydrophobic phase of the barrier layer contains an 
adhesive, the hydrophobic phase preferably comprising an 

elastomer, a plasticizer for elastomers and a tackifying 
resin, or in that the adhesive layer is an additional 

layer (4) arranged on the face of the barrier layer 
intended to face a wound or skin face, the adhesive layer 

being preferably applied in a pattern. 
A dressing according to claim 1 or 2, 
characterized
 
in that the discontinuous phase consists of 

one or more water soluble or water swellable hydrocolloids, 
starch or cellulose derivatives or hydrophilic 

polymers, preferably one or more water soluble or water 
swellable hydrocolloids and in particular sodium carboxymethylcellulose. 
A dressing according to claims 1-3, 
characterized
 
in that one or more medicaments, preferably  

 
in a smaller amount than in the reservoir layer, are 

incorporated in the discontinuous and/or continuous phase 
of the barrier layer. 
A dressing according to claims 1-4, 
characterized
 
in that the barrier layer (1, 1a, 1b) is 

composed of 

(I) a continuous phase containing 

(a) a physically cross-linked elastomer in the form of 
polyisobutylene, one or more styrene olefin styrene 

block copolymers or ethylene propylene block copolymers,

stated in items b-e, 
(b) a hydrocarbon resin in the form of a polymer or 
copolymer of cyclopentadiene, dicyclopentadiene, α-pinene 

and/or β-pinene, 
(c) an antioxidant, 
(d) optionally an oil extender consisting of one or more 
mineral oils, and 
(e) an elastomer polar plasticizer such as e.g. an ester 
of a polyethylene glycol or polypropylene glycol, or 

and ester of a di- or polybasic carboxylic acid with a 
preferably aliphatic alcohol, 
(II) a phase dispersed in the continuous phase and 
consisting of one or more water swellable hydrocolloids,

20-60% by volume. 
A dressing according to claims 1-5,

a hydrophobic polymer matrix preferably composed of an 
elastomer, a plasticizer for elastomers, a tacki
fying 
resin and optionally an oil based extender as well as an 

antioxidant, and in particular with a composition like the
