<ABSTRACT>
A novel and useful reactive phospholipid derivative is 
represented by the following general formula (1) 


in which R¹C(=O) and R²C(=O) are independently selected from 
aliphatic acyl groups, R³ denotes a hydrogen atom or a 

methyl group, OA represents an oxyalkylene group having 2 - 
4 carbon atoms, n indicates the average number of moles of 

added oxyalkylene groups and is 1 - 1000, p is O or 1, X 
represents 


with q and r being each an integer of 0 to 4 or 1 to 4, 
respectively, and M denotes hydrogen atom or an alkali 

metal atom. The novel derivative is used to form vesicles 
and to attach functional substances to those vesicles.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to novel and useful 
phospholipid derivatives, and to vesicles comprising or 
derived from the same, including vesicles having a 
functional group fixed thereonto. More specifically, the 
present invention relates to phospholipid derivatives to be 
used, for example, as a drug carrier for medicaments etc., 
testing drugs, diagnostic drugs, sensors, fixed catalysts, 
bioreactors, bioelectronics elements and a substitute for 
microcapsules, as well as for the production of various 
functional liposomes and fatty emulsions. Liposome is a lipid vesicle composed of a 
phospholipid bilayer and has been attempted to find its 
application in various fields. Attention has been paid, 
in particular, to the application to drug carrier and 
sensors for diagnosis and detection, where large 
problems have been encountered in providing the 
liposome with a specific function by fixing a special 
functional substance onto or into the liposome and in 
maintaining the concentration of such liposome cells in  
 
the blood. Heretofore, there have been reported as for 
the fixation of functional substances onto or into a 
liposome, for example, a method in which fragments of 
an antibody are bound to an aminoethyl carbamoyl-methyl 
group substituted on the polysaccharide on the surface 
of a liposome covered with a pullulan derivative via 
γ-maleimidobutyloxysuccinimidyl [ See "Biochem. 
Biophys. Acta.", 898, 323 (1987) ] and a method in 
which an antibody is fixed onto a liposome in such a 
manner that a glycolipid is added preliminarily to the 
ingredients for forming the liposome membrane and, 
after the liposome has been formed, a periodate 
oxidation is carried out and the thereby formed 
aldehyde group is reacted with the antibody [See "J. 
Biol. Chem.", 255, 10509 (1980)]. These prior arts include, however, a problem 
that a multistep chemical reaction on the liposome 
membrane has to be incorporated after the liposome has 
been formed and, thus, the amount of the contemplated 
functional substance introduced is limited to a lower 
value, with simultaneous high possibility of 
contamination by the by-products and impurities, 
bringing about a large probability of damage of the 
liposome membrane. On the other hand, it has been pointed out 
that no sufficient effect is achieved by the use of 
liposome, since a large part of the liposome is caught 
by organs in the reticuloendothelial system, such as 
liver, spleen etc., upon administration of the liposome  
 
product [Cancer Res., 43, 5328
