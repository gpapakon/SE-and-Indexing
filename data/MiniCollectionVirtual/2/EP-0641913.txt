<ABSTRACT>
Glazing bar arrangement for revetments, in particular window or door elements, which are formed from a frame and a sheet-like element filling the entire surface area enclosed by the frame, in particular a glass pane, which is retained, by means of its border, in a frame rebate sealed by a permanently elastic composition and, by means of attached edging mouldings (glazing bars), is subdivided optically into zones, in the case of which the glazing bars (5, 13) are provided, at their ends, in each case with at least one needle-like retaining pin (6) which can be pushed in the permanently elastic composition (3) and/or a transversely extending glazing bar (5). The glazing bars (5) are provided with longitudinally extending cutouts (7) which, after having been cut to the length defined by the inside width of the window, are provided as receiving means for the introduction of plugs (8) which bear the needle-like retaining pins (6). The cutouts are designed as longitudinal slits (7) which are undercut in the form of dovetails and serve as clip grooves for clipping the glazing bars onto a carrier moulding (10) which exhibits correspondingly designed clip webs (9). The carrier mouldings (10) may serve as carriers for the needle-like retaining pins (6). The glazing bars (5) are provided, on their borders, with edging lips (14) which are supported on the pane (2) in an apron-like manner.
