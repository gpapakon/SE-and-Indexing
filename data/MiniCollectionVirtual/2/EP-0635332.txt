<ABSTRACT>
A tool head (1) for accommodating tools and/or tool holders is proposed which has a tool spindle (5), at least two bearings (11, 15) supporting the tool spindle, which can be set in rotation, and a coolant feed serving to cool and/or lubricate the tool. The tool head is distinguished by the fact that the coolant feed comprises a first coolant passage (35) passing through the tool spindle (5).

A tool head for receiving tools and/or tool holders, having a tool spindle, at least two 
bearings supporting the tool spindle which can be set in rotation, and having a cooling 

agent feed which serves to cool and/or lubricate the tool and which has at least one 
cooling agent channel which penetrates the tool spindle, serves to feed the cooling agent 

and whose mouth located at a circumferential surface of the tool spindle is sealed relative 
to the bearings by means of a first sealing device, characterised in that a second sealing 

device (59) is provided and has at least two sealing rings (55, 57) which are arranged at a 
distance from one anoth
er and between which the first sealing device (17) is arranged, 
and in that a discharge channel (65) is provided between the first sealing device (17) and 

the second sealing device (59) in each case and co-operates with an indicating device 
(71) indicating a leakage. 
A tool head in accordance with Claim 1, characterised in that the cooling agent channel 
(35, 39) has two portions (35; 39), the second portion (39) opening between the bearings 

(11; 15) supporting the tool spindle (5). 
A tool head in accordance with Claim 1 or 2, characterised in that the central axis of the 
first portion (35) of the cooling agent channel coincides with the central axis (37) of the 

tool spindle (5). 
A tool head in accordance with Claim 1 or 2, characterised in that the first portion (35) of 
the cooling agent channel extends substantially parallel to the rotational axis (37) of the 

tool spindle (5). 
A tool head in accordance with any one of the preceding Claims, characterised in that the 
second portion (39) of the cooling agent channel has a plurality of channel portions 

which breach the circumferential surface (25) of the tool spindle (5) and which issue into 
the first portion (35) of the cooling agent channel. 
A tool head in accordance with any one of Claims 2 to 5, characterised in that the second 
portion (39) of the cooling agent channel extends perpendicularly to the central axis (37) 

of the tool spindle (5).  
 
A tool head in accordance with any one of the preceding Claims, characterised in that the 
first sealing device (17) comprises at least two sealing rings (19, 21) arranged at a 

distance from one another, and in that the mouth of the second portion (39) of the 
cooling agent channel lies between the sealing rings (19, 21). 
A tool head in accordance with Claim 7, characterised in that an annular channel (23) is 
formed through the sealing rings (19, 21) of the first sealing device (17) which are 

arranged at a distance from one another, the cooling agent and/or lubricant being fed into 
this annular channel (23).
