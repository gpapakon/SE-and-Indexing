<DESCRIPTION>
It is well known that fluoropolymers have excellent chemical 
and heat resistance and in general are hydrophobic. It is also 
known that expanded porous polytetrafluoroethylene (ePTFE) polymers 
have superior strength properties. Thus, expanded porous 
polytetrafluoroethylene is useful as a filter media for organic 
solvents and for use in harsh chemical environments. However, because of the hydrophobicity of fluoropolymers, 
aqueous dispersions cannot readily be filtered through filters made 
from these fluoropolymers. Such filters can be prewetted with 
organic solvents followed by flushing with water or using pressure 
to overcome the lack of affinity between the hydrophobic filter and 
the polar aqueous dispersion. However, such prewetting is 
expensive over the long term and can lead to "gas-lock" or 
"dewetting." For these reasons, there have been various attempts to make 
fluoropolymer surfaces more hydrophilic and receptive to wetting 
with water while still maintaining their desirable properties. One 
approach is to coat the surface and the interior of the pores with 
a fluorinated surfactant to improve hydrophilicity. Since the 
fluorosurfactant is bound to the surface of the membrane only by 
means of chemical affinity, the weakness of this approach is that 
over a period of time the fluorosurfactant will be washed out by 
the aqueous medium and the membrane will lose its water-wettability. 
In an attempt to solve this problem, another approach 
has been to use a fluorosurfactant which is then crosslinked by an  
 
irradiation treatment using a high energy radiation beam such as 
Gamma ray, electron team or non-equilibrium plasma. Such a 
crosslinked material will not diffuse out of the fluoropolymer 
matrix even when it is exposed to aqueous flow for an extended 
period of time. However, the high energy radiation weakens the 
mechanical strength of the fluoropolymer and the fluorinated 
surfactant will also suffer adverse effects ranging from 
deterioration of properties to alteration of its chemical 
properties. The US-A-5045354 describes a fluoropolymeric 
membrane coated with a fluoroaliphatic surfactant 
and a polyurethane.  
 To overcome the deficiencies described above, in this 
invention, normally hydrophobic fluoropolymeric porous membranes 
having continuous pores, i .e., passageways, are rendered 
hydrophilic, i.e., water-permeable, by coating the membrane with a 
mixture of at least one fluoroaliphatic surfactant and at least one 
substantially liquid water-insoluble hydrophilic
</DESCRIPTION>
<CLAIMS>
A water-permeable hydrophilic membrane comprising a porous 
fluoropolymeric membrane having continuous pores from one side to the 

other, in which the interior portion of the membrane that defines the pores is 
coated with a mixture of a fluoroaliphatic surfactant and a hydrophilic, 

substantially water insoluble polyurethane. 
The hydrophilic membrane of Claim 1 wherein the membrane is 
liquid water-resistant but water vapor-permeable. 
The hydrophilic membrane of Claim 2 wherein the membrane is 
expanded porous polytetrafluoroethylene. 
The hydrophilic membrane of Claim 1, 2 or 3 wherein the 
fluoroaliphatic surfactant has an end group of the formula F₃C(CF₂)
m
 wherein 
m is an integer of 3 through 8, imparts a surface tension to water of less than 

30 dynes per cm, and is an alcohol, an ester, and organic acid or an organic 
salt. 
The hydrophilic membrane of Claim 1, 2 or 3 wherein the 

hydrophilic polyurethane is the reaction product of a diisocyanate, a 
poly(oxyalkylene) glycol having predominately oxyethylene groups, and 

optionally a chain extender. 
The hydrophilic membrane of Claim 4 wherein the hydrophilic 
polyurethane is the reaction product of a diisocyanate, a poly(oxyalkylene) 

glycol having predominately oxyethylene groups, and optionally a chain 
extender. 
Process for preparing a hydrophilic membrane which comprises 
subjecting a hydrophilic fluoropolymeric membrane having continuous pores 

from one side to the other to a solution of a fluoroaliphatic surfactant and a 
hydrophilic, substantially water-insoluble polyurethane in an organic solvent, 

such that the solution penetrates into the pores and coats the interior portion 
of the membrane that defines the pores, and then drying the resulting 

membrane to remove solvent.
