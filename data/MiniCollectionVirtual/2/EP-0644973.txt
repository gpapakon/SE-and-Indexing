A four-phase method for producing a series of theme restaurants, wherein in phase "a", a number of identical or substantially identical modules are erected on respective sites at different locations; in phase "b", a series of different sets of decorations and scenery are produced; in phase "c", each of the modules is fitted with one set of decorations and scenery; and in phase "d", after a certain time has passed, at least one of the modules is converted by dismantling its decorations and scenery and replacing them with a set of others from another module or with a spare set.
