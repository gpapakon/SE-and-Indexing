Background of the InventionEnterically transmitted non-A/non-B hepatitis viral agent (ET-NANB, also referred to herein as hepatitis E virus or HEV) is the reported cause of hepatitis in several epidemics and sporadic cases in Asia, Africa, Europe, Mexico, and the Indian subcontinent. Infection is caused usually by water contaminated with feces, although the
