<ABSTRACT>
A high-speed preparing and transport device for use in particular in storage and sorting is described. The device according to the invention has a path-controlled transport platform (9) which is displaceable on a guide (8) and rotatable in relation to the guide (8) and on which a bottom carrier (10, 10a) provided with goods can be rigidly fixed. The transport platform (9) is equipped with a servo drive for carrying out the linear and rotary movement as well as for control of an inward-transfer and outward-transfer mechanism for the bottom carrier (10, 10a). Arranged in each set-down and delivery place are rotary platforms (5, 5a), onto which the bottom carriers (10, 10a) can be outward-transferred or handed over from the transport platform (9). Each rotary platform (5, 5a) has a fixing mechanism for fixing the bottom carrier (10, 10a). The rotatable transport platform (9) is transported to a delivery place (4) at high speed and with an orientation which is favourable for the displacement speed.

A high-speed marshalling and conveying system for 
use particularly for storage and sorting, characterised 

in that a conveying platform (9) is provided, which is 
mobile on a guide or slide (8), is track-controlled and 

rotatable relatively to the guide or slide (8), on 
which platform a base support (10, 10a) provided with 

goods or objects can be rigidly fixed, the transport 
platform (9) comprising a servo drive for carrying out 

the linear and rotary movement and for controlling an 
entry and exit mechanism for the base support (10, 

10a), with rotary platforms (5, 5a) at each parking and 
delivery station, on to which rotary platforms (5, 5a) 

the base supports (10, 10a) can be exited or 
transferred from the transport platform (9), each 

rotary platform (5, 5a) having a fixing mechanism for 
fixing the base support (10, 10a). 
A high-speed marshalling and conveying system 
according to claim 1, characterised in that a plurality 

of transport platforms (9) are provided. 
A high-speed marshalling and conveying system 
according to claim 1 or 2, characterised in that a 

variable parking station (6) is provided for receiving 
base supports (10, 10a). 
A high-speed marshalling and conveying system 
according to any one of the preceding claims, 

characterised in that the transport platform (9) is 
rotatable through 360°.  

 
A high-speed marshalling and conveying system 
according to any one of the preceding claims, 

characterised in that each rotary platform (5, 5a) 
disposed at a delivery and/or parking station (2, 3) is 

rotatable through ± 90° and comprises a linear 
displacement system for displacing the base support 

(10, 10a) on to the next rotary platform. 
A high-speed marshalling and conveying system 
according to any one of the preceding claims, 

characterised in that the base support (10, 10a) 
comprises at the bottom a fixing housing (12) for the 

fixing means and the removal mechanism (15) of the 
transport platform (9) and is provided with base 

rollers (11) and has at the top a holder for any 
desired superstructure (16). 
A method of marshalling and conveying 
goods/objects wherein a base support
 (10, 10a) provided 
with goods is received by a rotatable transport 

platform (9) and is conveyed to a delivery station (4) 
at high speed and with the optimum orientation for the 

speed of travel, is transferred there to a rotary 
platform (5), brought into the required removal 

position by appropriate rotation of the rotary platform 
(5), and after removal the empty base support (10) is 

conveyed to a variable parking place (6) by a linear 
displacement system, from which variable parking 

station (6) it is received by the transport platform 
(9) and brought to the intended parking station (2), 

the steps being performed with a delay by a second base 
support (10a) so that the loading and transport 

operation takes place continuously.  
 
A method according to claim 7, characterised in 
that the delay is such that the transport platform (9) 

with the second base support (10) arrives at the 
delivery station (4) when the first base support (10) 

is being conveyed to the variable parking station.
