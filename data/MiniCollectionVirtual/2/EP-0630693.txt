<ABSTRACT>
A sorting machine is disclosed in which a viewing 
window is electro-optically observed using an array of 

photodetectors, each observing a photo site or pixel of the 
viewing window. Each photodetector, and thus each photo site 

can be normalised individually to account for background and 
photodetector sensitivity differences from photo site to 

photo site. The machine can sample the outputs of the 
photodetectors sequentially and, by deriving respective 

binary "pass" and "fail" signals and supplying these 
sequentially to the serial input of shift register 100 

incorporated in processing means can reject products 
affording a series, of more than a predetermined number, of 

"fail" signals and thus reject products that have a larger 
than acceptable number of adjacent defective photo sites. 

Also disclosed is a circuit (Figures 3 and 4) for rejecting 
a defective product based on sensing where its trailing edge 

is or should be if covered up by a successive overlapping 
product. Such detection also allows for rejecting products 

that are either too long or too short. All of this is done 
by digital processing resulting from the digitizing 

permitted by photo site detection.

<DESCRIPTION>
THIS INVENTION pertains to sorting machines used to sort
fungible products, such as nuts and many other agricultural
products, by passing the products along a channel having a
viewing window and detecting products that are substandard
in shade from those that are within standard limits and
rejecting those that are substandard.A typical sorter of fungible products of the type just
described is comprised of one or more channels that are
gravity fed with the products from a top loaded hopper, the
products flowing in the channel in a fairly constant stream
and sometimes overlapping one another. The channel background
is electro-optically observed through a viewing
window, while no products are flowing, by at least one
photodetector to produce an output that is representative of
that background. Although only one photodetector is used in
a very simple machine, it is common to employ multiple
photodetectors, for example, three, viewing the product
flow from various different viewing angles. The background
for each photodetector is separately determined
for such machines. This process of determining a signal 
representative of the background without product flow is
know as "normalizing".When the product flow is initiated and the actual
product flow is electro-optically sensed, the background
signal is subtracted from the total output so that the
background is discounted in determining whether the product
flow includes all standard or acceptable products or
includes a substandard product now and again. Assuming the
latter, when a substandard product is sensed by an electro-optical
photodetector by having at least a portion of its
surface area being either lighter or darker than a standard
shade, then a reject signal is produced, following a
suitable delay, to activate a reject mechanism, which
diverts the substandard product from the channel. The
delay is necessary for the product to fall below the
viewing window and be opposite the reject mechanism. The
reject mechanism is typically a burst or jet of air that
blows the substandard product out of the ordinary channel
flow to drop into a reject bin.From time to time, product flow must be suspended for
the viewing window to be either blown clean or wiped clean
of dust and to again determine a new "normalizing" value
for the background shade.Although such prior art sorting machines as generally
described above have used digital logic in switching from
sort mode to normalizing mode and for determining the
timing delay for the proper operation of the reject
mechanism

<CLAIMS>
A sorting machine having at least one channel through which fungible
products to be sorted flow, electro-optical means (46) to observe the products and

reject means for rejecting products from the channel characterised in that in use of
the machine each product is observed by the electro-optical means (46) over the

length of the product by observing sequential photo sites of the product, each site
being classified as a defect site or as an approved site, products being rejected by

the reject means from the channel when determined to be substandard by having an
excessive number of sequential defect sites, the machine having a defect size

determiner, comprising comparator means(40) receiving the sequential site outputs
from the electro-optical means and producing a site reject output when a site output

from the electro-optical means exceeds a predetermined level and a site approved

output when a site output from the electro-optical means does not exceed the
predetermined level, a register(100) for producing a sub-standard product output

indicative of a sub-standard product when a preselected number of positions in said
register have been sequentially serially exceeded, said register being reset with the

occurrence of each site approved output from said comparator means, said register
advancing a position with the occurrence of each site reject output, and means for

setting the preselected number of consecutive positions for said rejector to advance
in order to produce a serial output indicative of a sub-standard product, said register

sub-standard product output activating the reject means to reject the sub-standard
product from the channel.
A sorting machine according to Claim 1 wherein said electro-optical
means comprise photodetectors adapted to produce a product detection signal

having a leading edge which is generated in response to detection of the front edge 
of a product in the viewing window, and an opposite trailing edge produced in

response to detection of the back edge of said product in the viewing window, there
being a first timer(76) for producing a signal of multiple pulse of a predetermined

acceptable length beginning with the detection of the front edge of said product in
the viewing window, said pulses being separated by predetermined pauses and

continuing as long as there is product detection at the occurrence of the leading
edge of each successive pulse, and logic means(84-92) for producing a product end

output that is determined by the trailing edge of the product detection signal
occurring at a time before the end of the timer output pulse, and alternately, by the

trailing edge of the timer pulse when the trailing edge of said product detection
signal occurs thereafter.
A sorting machine according to Claim 2 including a minimum length
rejector comprising a second timer(86) for producing a pulse beginning with the

detection of the first edge of said product and a trailing edge determined by a pre-set
acceptable minimum length product, and a rejector for producing a reject signal

when the trailing edge of said product detection signal occurs before the trailing
edge of said pulse from said second timer.
A sorting machine according to Claim 2 or 3 including a maximum
length rejector wherein said second timer(86) produces a second pulse beginning

with the leading edge of the second pulse from the first timer(76), said rejector
producing a reject signal when the trailing edge of the product detection signal

occurs before the trailing edge of second pulse from the second timer.
A sorting machine according to any one of Claims 2 to 4 wherein said
first timer(76) includes a gated oscillator.
