<ABSTRACT>
In a device for manufacturing bricks from clay, a 
continuous strand (2) of clay is formed by a pressure nozzle (1) 

connecting onto a supply holder. Portions are severed 
from the strand by means of a cutting member. It occurs 

in practice that, subject to the composition of the clay, 
the strand of clay (2) coming out of the pressure nozzle (1) 

breaks off spontaneously. According to the invention this 
is avoided by having a funnel-like part (11) connect onto the 

pressure nozzle (1).

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a device for manufacturing 
bricks from clay, comprising a pressure nozzle connecting 
onto a supply holder for forming a continuous strand of 
clay, a cutting member for regularly severing a piece of 
clay from the moving strand, means arranged close to the 
pressure nozzle for covering the strand with sand and 
means for transporting away a piece of clay severed from 
the strand. Such a device is known from the Netherlands patent 
161.832 (= GB-A-1 448 551). A difficulty in applying the known device is that, 
subject to the composition of the clay, a tendency may 
occur toward premature, spontaneous breakage of the 
strand. That is, before the cutting member severs a piece 
of strand to the desired length, it has already broken 
off. The invention has for its object to provide a solution 
to this problem. This is achieved according to the invention in that 
a funnel-like part connects onto the pressure nozzle. It has been found in practice that with the steps 
according to the invention the danger of premature breakage 
of the strand is obviated and that any suitable 
composition of the clay can be applied in operationally 
reliable manner in the present invention. The funnel-like part preferably has a diameter 
tapering from 150 to 140 mm. The invention is elucidated with reference to the 
drawings of an embodiment. In the drawings: 
Fig. 1 shows schematically a device according to the 
invention, Fig. 2 shows in perspective view a part of the 
device of fig. 1, and  
 Fig. 3 shows in sectional side view the funnel-like 
part according to the invention. A strand 2 is formed from a supply holder 1 for clay 
using a pressure nozzle. Using the sand-covering device 
the side periphery of the strand is covered with sand 
from a supply container 3 for sand. The strand runs 
between a pair of rollers 4. In the cutting device 5 a 
piece is severed from the strand to the desired length. 
The severed piece 6 is subjected by a pair of conveyor 
belts 7 to an accelerating movement such that the block 6 
falls with high kinetic energy into a mould container 8 
and fills it. According to fig. 2, sand-covering is carried out by 
spoon-like members 9, 10 which carry sand out of the 
supply container 3 onto the side wall of the strand. According to the invention a funnel-like part 11 is 
arranged connecting on the pressure nozzle opening, the 
diameter of which part 11 has a comparatively small taper 
in the vertical direction. The taper is preferably from 
150 mm to 140 mm. Practical
