<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an industrial 
process for producing pyrrolidine derivative or a salt 
thereof represented by the following general formula (I) : 
wherein
 
   R¹ is heterocyclic(lower)alkyl,
 
   R² is acyl, and
 
   R³ is carboxy(lower)alkyl or protected 
carboxy(lower)alkyl, and is applicable in 
the medical field. Pyrrolidine derivatives of the above general formula 
(I), or salts thereof and a method for producing them are 
known as disclosed in Japanese Patent Publication No. 2-152960. The method described in the above-mentioned bulletin 
for the production of compounds of general formula (I) is 
disadvantageous in that it requires a long series of steps 
complicating the production and provides only a very low 
overall yield rendering the production cost high.  The object of this invention is to provide an 
industrially excellent production method for producing 
compounds of general formula (I) and salts thereof which 
is superior to the above known production process in 
simplicity and in yield. The method for producing said pyrrolidine derivative 
(I) according to this invention is as follows. 
wherein
 
   R¹, R² and R³ are each as defined above,
 
   R⁴ is aryl, and
 
   Y⊖ is an anion. The starting compound (II) is novel and can be 
produced by the following processes. 
wherein
 
   R¹ and R² are each as defined above,
 
   R⁵ is carboxy or protected carboxy,
 
   R 5 / a is protected carboxy,
 
   R⁶ is lower alkyl,
 
   M is an alkali metal,
 
   X¹ and X² are each a leaving group, and
 
   X³ is halogen. In the above and subsequent descriptions of the 
present specification, suitable examples and illustrations 
of the various definitions which the present invention 
include within the scope thereof are explained in detail 
as follows. The term "lower" is intended to mean, unless 
otherwise indicated, 1 to 6 carbon atoms. Suitable "lower alkyl" and "lower alkyl moiety" in 
the terms "heterocyclic(lower)alkyl", 
"carboxy(lower)alkyl" and "protected carboxy(lower)alkyl" 
may include straight or branched one having 1 to 6 carbon 
atom(s) such as methyl, ethyl, propyl, isopropyl, butyl, 
isobutyl, sec-butyl, tert-butyl, pentyl, tert-pentyl, 
hexyl and the like, preferably one having 1 to 4 carbon 
atom(s). Suitable "aryl" may include phenyl, naphthyl, and the 
like.  Suitable "heterocyclic moiety" in the term 
"heterocyclic(lower)alkyl" means saturated or unsaturated 
hetero-monocyclic or -polycyclic group containing at least 
one hetero-atom such as oxygen, sulfur and
