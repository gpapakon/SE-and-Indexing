represents a perfluorinated alkyl radical having 1 
to 3 carbon atoms. 
4. Process for the preparation of β-fluoroacyl-β-halogenovinyl 
alkyl ethers of the general formula (I)  

 

 
in which
R¹
represents a fluorinated alkyl radical having 1 to 
9 carbon atoms, 
Hal
represents a halogen atom and 
R²
represents an alkyl radical having 1 to 7 carbon 
atoms, 
characterised in that β-fluoroacylvinyl alkyl ethers of 
the formula (II)
R¹-CO-CH=CH-OR²
 
where 
R¹ and R² have the abovementioned meaning, 
are reacted with a halogenating agent at temperatures 

from  -70°C to +80°C, if appropriate in the presence of a 
diluent, and, if appropriate, the resulting halogenation 

product of the general formula (III) 

 
is isolated, and dehydrohalogenation is c
arried out at a 
temperature from  -20°C to +100°C, 
5. Process according to Claim 4, characterised in 
that chlorine, bromine or sulphuryl chloride is employed 

as the halogenating agent, halogenation is carried out at 
a temperature from  -20 to +20°C, and an organic base is 

employed for dehydrohalogenation, if appropriate in an 
inert solvent. 
6. Process according to Claim 4, characterised in 
that sulphuryl chloride or chlorine is used as the 

halogenating agent, and dehydrohalogenation is carried 
out by heating under reduced pressure without the addition 

of a base. 
7. Process according to Claim 4, characterised in  
 

that 1.0 to 1.1 moles of halogenating agent are employed 
per mole of β-fluoroacylvinyl alkyl ether of the formula 

(II). 
8. Process according to Claim 5, characterised in 
that 1.0 to 1.5 moles of organic base are employed per 

mole of compound of the formula (III). 
9. Process according to Claim 5, characterised in 
that a tertiary amine or an amidine is used as the 

organic base. 
10. Process according to Claim 5, characterised in 
that triethylamine is employed as the organic base.
