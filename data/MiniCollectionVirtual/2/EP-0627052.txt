conveyed to an electric circuit,
characterized
 in that the electric circuit 
actuates the electromechanical transducer (20) in such a 

way that in a first range (A) of volumetric flow rate a 
restricting function is performed and in a second range (B) 

of volumetric flow rate a pressure-limiting function is 
performed. 
A vibration absorber valve as claimed in claim 1,

transducer (20) is configured in the shape of a plunger 

coil (15) which interacts with a permanent magnet (17) and 
whose carrier forms the valve body (14).

characterized
 in that the valve body (14) 
and/or the chamber disposed downstream of the cross-sectional 

areas of flow (12), as seen in the flow

characterized
 in that the cross-sectional 
areas of flow (12) terminate into an annular hydraulic 

chamber (22) which is connected to outlet ducts (23) of the 
absorber valve (10) in such a manner that the static 

pressure developing in the annular chamber (22) renders 
effective a hydraulic force component which counteracts the 

Bernouille's forces acting on the valve body (14). 
A vibration absorber valve as claimed in claim 3 or in 
anyone of claims 4 to 6,
characterized
 in that the guide element (11) 
includes radial pressure-relieving grooves (27) which 

terminate into a slot (26) provided between the valve body  
 

(14) and the guide element (11). 
A vibration absorber valve as claimed in claim 7,
characterized
 in that the guide element (11) 
includes pressure agent ducts (28) which are connected to 

the slot (26) and which are preceded by a filter element

annular grooves (39) are provided in the range of the 

cross-sectional areas of flow (12). 
A vibration absorber valve as claimed in claim 8,
characterized
 in that the guide element (11) 
includes a bore (31) within which a cylindrical element 

(32) is guided that is loosely axially abutted against the 
valve body (14) and the end surface of which can be acted 

upon by the hydraulic pressure prevailing in the vibration 
absorber (10). 
A vibration absorber valve as claimed in claim 2,
characterized
 in that the valve body (14) is 
suspended on a bending spring (25) which is compressed in 

the absorber valve housing (35).

caused by adjustment of the valve body (14).
