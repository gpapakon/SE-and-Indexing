<ABSTRACT>
A navigation system for guiding a vehicle to a destination in 
accordance with a predetermined route composed of roads and branching 

points, comprising : a data base for storing the names of the roads, the 
names of the branching points, and the relational information between 

entry roads and escape roads ; first picture means for displaying a route 
information screen listing up at least the road names and the branching 

point names ; input means for issuing a screen operating signal for 
displaying the route information screen ; and control means for reading 

the route information from the data base in response to the screen 
operating signal from the input means and for controlling the displaying 

of the route information screen by listing up at least the road names 
and the branching point names.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a navigation system for guiding
a vehicle to a destination via a predetermined route and, more particularly,
to a navigation system for enabling a detailed map on the route, as
contains the roads and branching points on the route, the route in the
periphery of the destination and the guide ending position, to be accessed
from a route information screen.In the prior art, the navigation system guides the route so that
the vehicle can safely arrive at a first destination. In recent years, various
technologies have been vigorously developed to improve the performances
and functions such as the navigation accuracy, the operability and the
visibility. This navigation system is provided with a destination setting
screen to be used for setting the route, a route searching screen for
displaying the searched route, a route information screen for displaying
the searched route information, and a route guiding screen to be opened
for the guide automatically or according to the will of the driver. The
display screen after the guide is started includes a section map for
guiding a wide area over route - set several sections including that
section of the entire route which is being followed, and an intersection
map for guiding at intersections.Some navigation system further has further functions to provide
information of the remaining distance, the name and the turning direction
of the intersection, at which the vehicle should turn, so as to follow
the route without fail, to teach distinguishing marks so as to confirm
the route being followed, to make the guidance not only through the 
display but also in speeches.In order to set a route in such navigation system, it is necessary
to input a starting point and a destination. If the starting point and
the destination are determined by the inputting, a route searching is
processed from the peripheries of the departing point and the destination
and the route information data between them so that an optimum route
is deter mined from a plurality of routes. When this route search is
ended, there is opened an entire route map which is displayed with the
present position, the destination and the route inbetween. The route
guide is started by grasping the summary of the route from that entire
route map.In some of the navigation systems having such route guiding
functions, the names of the entrance and exit of an expressway to be
used at first are exclusively displayed as the essential points of the route
in the entire route display after the route

<CLAIMS>
A navigation system for guiding a vehicle to a destination along a preselected
route including roads, comprising:


a) memory means (3) for storing therein map data and at least road name
data;
b) display means (12);
c) input means (11) for permitting input of a destination;
d) present position detector means (2);
e) route search means (4) for searching route information indicative of a route
to the input destination from the present position as detected by access of

the data stored in said memory means (3);
f) route memory means (4) for storing the route information as determined by
said route search means;
g) control means (4);
h) first visualization means (4); wherein
i) said control means (4) is adapted for searching at least for a name of a
road responsive to the route information stored in said route memory

means;
j) said visualization means (4) is adapted for visually indicating branching points on said running route and the names of the roads between said branching points on said
display means
k) display control means (4) are provided for controlling said display means
(12) to selectively display either one of a running route screen displaying a running route from the

present position of the vehicle to a destination or a route information screen
(7) displaying branching points on said running route and the names of the roads between said branching points to the destination searched by said control means

(4), both of said different screens being activated
in response to manual inputs by users.
A navigation system according to claim 1, 
characterized
in that
 said control means (4) lists
the road names searched and branching point names

and that said visualization means (4)
visually indicates the list of said road names and said branching point

names as a route information screen.
