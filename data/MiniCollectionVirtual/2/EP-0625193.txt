<DESCRIPTION>
INSECTICIDALLY EFFECTIVE PEPTIDESThis invention relates to msecticidally effective peptides. More particularly, the invention relates, inter alia, to a family of msecticidally effective peptides which may be isolated from Tegenaria spider venom, DNA encoding such msecticidally effective peptides, and methods for controlling invertebrate pests.In recent years, the public has become acutely aware of the environmental hazards and mammalian toxicity associated with the use of synthetic insecticides. As a result, the use of these insecticides has been rapidly declining. However, the need for effective insect control has not changed. This has prompted researchers to develop novel methods of insect control.The most widely used microbial pesticides are derived from the bacterium Bacillus thuringiensis (hereinafter B.t). This bacterial agent is used to control a variety of leaf-eating caterpillars, Japanese beetles and mosquitos. U.S. Patent No. 4,797,279 issued January 10, 1989 to Karamata et al., discloses hybrid bacterial cells comprising the gene coding for B.t. kurstaki delta-endotoxin and the gene coding for B.t. tenebrionis delta-endotoxin and their preparation. The B.t. hybrids are active against pests susceptible to B.t. kurstaki strains as well as against pests susceptible to B.t. tenebrionis strains. Generally, these hybrids have useful insecticidal properties which are superior to those observed by physical mixtures of the parent strains in terms of level of insecticidal activity, or in terms of spectrum of activity, or both. The insecticidal compositions comprising such microorganisms may be used to combat insects by applying the hybrids in an msecticidally effective amount to the insects or to their environment.Another derivation from the bacterium B.t. was disclosed in European Patent Application, Publication No. 0 325 400 A1 , issued toGilroy and Wilcox. This invention relates to a hybrid toxin gene which is toxic to lepidopteran insects. Specifically, the invention comprises a hybrid delta endotoxin gene comprising part of the B.t. var. kurstaki HD-73 toxin gene and part of the toxin gene from B.t var. kurstaki strain HD-1. The hybrid toxin gene (DNA) encoding a protein having activity against lepidopteran insects was disclosed. 

 The bacterium B.t was also utilized for its insecticidal properties in European Patent Application, Publication No. 0 340 948, issued to Wilcox, et al. This invention concerns hybrid pesticidal toxins which are produced by the fusion of an insect gut epithelial cell
