 DESCRIPTIONTitleAn Anal Region Rinsing SystemTechnical FieldThe present invention relates to rinsing systems, and more particularly to a rinsing system which is specifically designed for cleansing the anal region of a user after defecation.Background ArtAfter defecation, the anal region is usually cleaned by toilet paper or water rinsing. However, using toilet paper to wipe clean the anal region may lead to contamination of the hands. Further, the disposal of the toilet paper is problematical as storage in a trash bin could prove unsanitary and wasteful of space, while flushing of the toilet paper could clog the bowl. A variety of anal region rinsing systems employing spray nozzles have been designed to eliminate this problem, however, they tend to be of considerable expense as their mechanisms generally require modification of the entire lavatory bowl to accommodate the integral spray nozzles. Furthermore, the spray nozzles of the aforementioned prior art rinsing systems generally are at a fixed angular orientation so as to be inconvenient to a user requiring him or her to perform various motions to align their anal region with the ensuing water jet.Disclosure of the InventionThe present invention has been accomplished in order to overcome the aforesaid disadvantages of the prior art rinsing systems. It is therefore an object of the present invention to provide an anal region rinsing system which is inexpensive to manufacture and easy to assemble. It is another object of the present invention to provide an anal region rinsing system which is easy to operate. It is still another object of the present invention to provide an anal region rinsing system which can be conveniently adjusted to allow the spray nozzles thereof to be accurately aimed at the anal region. It is still another object of the present invention to provide an anal region rinsing system 

which has means to protect the spray nozzle thereof against contamination when not in use. It is still another object of the present invention to provide an anal region rinsing system which has means to automatically move the spray nozzle thereof into a guard for protection after each use.Brief Description of the DrawingsFig. 1 is a perspective view showing a lavatory bowl and the anal region rinsing system of the present invention.Fig. 2 is a perspective view showing dissassembled members of the rinsing system disposed along the underside of a seat of the lavatory bowl.Fig. 3 is a perspective view showing the members of the rinsing system disposed

 CLAIMS
1. An anal region rinsing system comprising a generally T-shaped pipe having a first end connected to a water supply, a second end connected to a water tank, and a third end, an electric water heater having a water ingress port connected to the third end of said T-shaped pipe, and a water egress port, a pressure reducing pipe having a first end connected to the water egress port of said electric water heater, and a second end, a lavatory bowl disposed below said water tank, a lavatory seat pivotably attached over said lavatory bowl and being covered with a lavatory cover, two axle holders mounted on a rear portion of said lavatory seat said axle holders each having a side pin on which said lavatory cover is attached, and a holder lug pressed against the underside of said lavatory seat, a water egress pipe connected to the second end of said pressure reducing pipe via a control valve, and being movably retained under said lavatory seat by said holder lug, and characterized in that:
said water egress pipe includes two locating rings mounted therearound at locations near respective said axle holders, a lever at an end opposite said control valve, a return spring near said lever having a first end connected to said water egress pipe and a second end connected to the axle holder which is near said lever, a rinsing tube connected to said water egress pipe at a right angle and protected by a guard, wherein rotating said lever and moving it outwards relative to said lavatory bowl causes said rinsing tube to be moved out of said guard, permitting a continuous flow of water to be discharged out of said rinsing tube after the opening of said control valve, so as to clean the anal region of the user who sits on said lavatory seat, releasing said lever causes said return spring to move back said water egress pipe permitting said rinsing tube to be received inside said guard.
2. An anal region rinsing system as recited in claim 1, wherein said rinsing tube projects into said lavatory bowl through a 45 degree angle when said lever is disposed horizontally.
3. An anal region rinsing system as recited in claim 1, wherein said pressure reducing pipe has a narrow couduit for passing water, said narrow conduit being made to reduce the water pressure to a desired lever.
