<ABSTRACT>
The method and the device for checking the bead 2 of a product forming a seal, which product is delivered onto a surface 3, along a predetermined path, via the end of a nozzle 1 placed above the surface, are such that the freshly deposited fraction of the bead 2 is illuminated, behind the nozzle 1 with respect to its direction of movement A, by a light beam output by a tubular bundle 17 of optical fibres and the reflected light 18 is collected in order to be transmitted to a processing unit 21, characterised in that the reflected light 18 is transmitted to a processing unit along an optical path which preserves the structure and the orientation of the illuminated scene, as far as a sensor 21 for converting this light into electrical signals which are, for their part, sent to a fixed installation 26, 27 through frictional contacts 23, 25.

A method of monitoring a bead (2) of material that forms a seal
which is applied to a surface (3) via the end of a nozzle (1) that is

moved over said surface (3) along a determined path, in which the
fraction of the recently-deposited bead (2) behind the nozzle (1)

relative to its direction of movement (A) is illuminated by a light
beam coming from a bundle (17) of optical fibers, and the light

reflected is recovered to be conveyed to a processor unit (26, 27),
the method being characterized in that the optical fiber bundle (17)

is tubular, in that the reflected light (18) is conveyed to the
processor unit along an optical path which conserves the structure

and the orientation of the illuminated scene to a sensor (21) for
transforming said light into electrical signals, said sensor moving

with the illuminating bundle, and in that the electrical signals from
the sensor (21) are conveyed to a stationary installation via wiper

contacts (23, 25).
Apparatus for implementing the method of claim 1, the apparatus
comprising a nozzle (1) for forming a bead (2) of adhesive, detector

members (9) situated close to the outlet of the nozzle (1) and
carried by a rotor (6) that is rotatable relative to a stator (4)

supporting the nozzle (1) about an axis that coincides with the axis
of the nozzle (1), and transmission means (11, 15) for transmitting

illuminating light to the detector members (9) and comprising a
bundle of optical fibers (15), the apparatus being characterized in

that the end of the optical fiber bundle is shaped in tubular manner
(17) in the detector members (9), in that a sensor (21) of reflected

light (18) is supported by the rotor (6), in that means for conveying
said reflected light connect the detector members (9) to the sensor

(21), and include an optical path located inside the tubular bundle
of fibers (17) and an inclined mirror (19) for reflecting the rays

(18) from the scene being monitored towards the sensor (21) without

deforming the image of said scene written in the tubular end of the
beam (17), and in that the signals from the sensor are transmitted to

a stationary operating installation (26, 27, 28) via a rotary
collector (23, 25) having wiper contacts and disposed between the

sensor (4) and the rotor (6). 
Apparatus according to claim 2, characterized in that the inside
diameter of the tubular end (17) of the bundle (15) is greater than

the width of the bead (2).
Apparatus according to claim 2 or claim 3, characterized in that
the sensor is constituted by a conventional matrix (21) of color

video camera cells that are scanned and associated with a circuit
(22) for processing the fundamental components of light.
