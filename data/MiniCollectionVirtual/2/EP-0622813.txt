<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a resistive element consisting of a strip of resistive material in which slots (18, 19, 20, 21) are formed, according to a defined pitch, delimiting at least one zig-zag electrical circuit between two ends (11, 12) of the resistive element serving as electrical connections, characterised in that the said slots are inclined with respect to an axis passing through the said electrical connections by an angle with a value determined so as to confer the desired electrical resistance on the said resistive element. Application to braking rheostats.

<CLAIMS>
A resistive element constituted by a strip of a resistive material 
in which slots (18, 19, 20, 21) are provided at a determined pitch so 

as to define at least one zigzag electric circuit between two ends 
(11, 12) of the resistive element, which ends serve as electrical 

connections, said slots being inclined relative to an axis 
intersecting said electrical connections, the angle of inclination 

(Óúç) of the slots being determined to impart the desired electrical 
resistance to said resistive element, said resistive element being 

provided with: 

a first longitudinal series of slots (18) extending from a 
first edge (16) of the strip (10); and 
a second longitudinal series of slots (19) extending from an 
opposite second edge (17) of the strip (10); 
said resistive element being characterized in that it is 
further provided with: 
at least one longitudinal series of slots (20, 21) provided 
internally in the strip (10); 
so as to form transverse series of strips, each of the 
transverse series comprising one slot from each of the longitudinal 

series, said slots of said transverse series being disposed side-by-side 
so as to define at least two electric circuits in parallel. 
A resistive element according to claim 1, characterized in that 
the strip forms a plate (10, 25). 
A resistive element according to claim 1 or 2, characterized in 
that an additional slot (26) is provided between the end of an 

electric circuit and the corresponding end of the resistive element, 
if said end of the electric circuit lies between an internal slot and 

one of said edges of the strip. 
A resistive element according to claim 3, characterized in that it 
includes in series a plurality of electric circuits in parallel.
