<ABSTRACT>
If the lateral acceleration conditions are measured on a rail vehicle and if the inclination of a load floor is correspondingly optimised, problems occur as a result of time delays between the measurement and positioning and as a result of faults which are included in the measurement. This is overcome in that track data which are relevant to the lateral inclination are stored in a track model memory (27), with the detected actual position (1), the track data which are just relevant or will be relevant in future are called up and the inclination ( alpha s) of the load floor which is necessary at that precise moment is calculated (29) and set (11) as a function of the identified instantaneous speed (9) of the vehicle.
