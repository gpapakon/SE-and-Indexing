<ABSTRACT>
A plate plastics optical waveguide comprises a 
core portion (3) composed of a polymer containing a 

deuteriumation or a halogen atom, and a clad portion 
(2,7) which surrounds the core portion and composed 

of a polymer having a refractive index lower than 
that of the core portion. The plastics optical 

waveguide which has a core portion comprising a 
deuterated or halogenated polyacrylate or 

polysiloxane shows an optical loss of 0.1 dB/cm or 
less for a light at a wavelength of 1.3 µm.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to plastics
optical waveguides, more particularly to a planar
plastics optical waveguide useful as optical
components such as optical couplers or multiplexers
for optical communication or image transmission.As for a base material for optical components or
optical fibers, generally inorganic substances such
as silica glass and multicomponent glass are used
because their propagation loss is low and their
transmission band is wide.On the other hand, optical components using
plastics as a base material have been developed.
Plastics optical materials used therefore have a good
fabrication flexibility and the controllability of
optical properties compared with inorganic optical
materials, and therefore, much attention has been
paid thereon with an expectation that optical
waveguides having relatively good characteristics
could be produced with ease using them. A planar
plastics optical waveguide made e.g. of PMMA,
polycarbonate or polystyrene is disclosed in DE-A-3842480.Representative techniques for producing of planar
plastics optical waveguides include a selective 
photopolymerization and a utilization of a
photosensitive resin.The selective photopolymerization method is a
technique in which monomers contained in a polymer
are selectively polymerized to change the refractive
index to make a pattern-like optical waveguide. More
particularly, at first a mask having a predetermined
pattern is mounted on a polymer sheet or substrate
composed of a transparent polymer such as
polycarbonate which contains a low refractive index
monomer such as methyl acrylate, and the sheet or
substrate is irradiated with ultraviolet rays
through the mask to selectively polymerize the low
refractive index monomer in accordance with the
pattern. The photopolymerized portion of the polymer
has a lower refractive index than the polymer matrix.
Then the polymer sheet is heated in vacuum to remove
unreacted monomers which remain in areas unexposed
with ultraviolet rays. As a result, the unexposed
portion of the polymer consists of the high
refractive index polymer alone. Thus, a patterned
sheet can be obtained in which a high refractive
index portion serving as a core is formed in
accordance with a predetermined pattern. Finally,
the patterned sheet is sandwiched by a clad composed
of a low refractive index polymer to produce an
objective optical part.On the other hand, according to the method which
uses a photosensitive polymer, a photosensitive
polymer is pattern-wise exposed to a light to cause
cross
