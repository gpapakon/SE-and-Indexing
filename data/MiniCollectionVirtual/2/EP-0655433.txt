<ABSTRACT>
A process for producing dimethyl carbonate is 
carried out by a first step of catalytically reacting 

carbon monoxide with methyl nitrite to produce dimethyl 
carbonate; a second step of absorbing dimethyl carbonate 

contained in a gas fraction withdrawn from the first step 
by dimethyl oxalate; a third step of regenerating methyl 

nitrite by contacting nitrogen monoxide contained in a 
gas fraction withdrawn from the second step with a 

molecular oxygen-containing gas and methyl alcohol; a 
fourth step of collecting dimethyl carbonate by 

distilling a liquid fraction withdrawn from the second 
step; and a fifth step of producing and recovering methyl 

nitrite from a purge gas consisting of a minor portion of 
a gas fraction withdrawn from one of the second step and 

the third step by bringing the purge gas together with an 
ammonia-oxidation product gas into contact with methyl 

alcohol in a methyl nitrite-recovering column, to thereby 
produce and recover methyl nitrite contained in the 

recovering column with a high efficiency at a high level 
of safety.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a process for
continuously producing dimethyl carbonate. More
particularly, the present invention relates to an
industrial process for continuously producing dimethyl
carbonate in large scale by a catalytical reaction in gas
phase of carbon monoxide with methyl nitrite in the
presence of a solid catalyst, while effectively and
safely recovering methyl nitrite and nitrogen monoxide
from a purge gas withdrawn from a gas-circulating system
for this process, and restricting a loss of carbon
monoxide.Dimethyl carbonate is a compound useful as a
material for synthesizing aromatic polycarbonates,
medicines and agricultural chemicals, and as a solvent.A conventional industrial process for producing
dimethyl carbonate by a catalytical reaction in gas phase
of carbon monoxide with methyl nitrite in the presence of
a solid catalyst comprises, as disclosed in U.S. Patent
No. 5,214,185, a first step of catalytically reacting
carbon monoxide with methyl nitrite in gas phase in the
presence of a solid catalyst in a reactor to produce
dimethyl carbonate; a second step of absorbing dimethyl
carbonate produced in the first step by an absorbing
medium consisting of dimethyl oxalate in a dimethyl
carbonate-absorbing column (absorbing column), to provide
a liquid fraction comprising dimethyl carbonate absorbed
by dimethyl oxalate and a non-condensed gas fraction
containing nitrogen monoxide; a third step of
regenerating methyl nitrite by bringing nitrogen monoxide
in the non-condensed gas fraction into contact with
molecular oxygen and methyl alcohol in a methyl nitrite-regenerating 
column (regenerating column); and a fourth
step of distil-collecting dimethyl carbonate from the
liquid fraction produced in the second step and
containing dimethyl oxalate in which dimethyl carbonate
is absorbed, in an extract-distilling column and a
dimethyl carbonate-distilling column, the reaction of
carbon monoxide with methyl nitrile and the regeneration
of methyl nitrite from nitrogen monoxide are carried out
in accordance with the following chemical equations.
CO + 2CH3ONO → CO(OCH3)2 + 2NO2NO + 2CH3OH + ½O2 → 2CH3ONO + H2O
As the chemical equations clearly show, in the dimethyl
carbonate-producing process, methyl nitrite and nitrogen
monoxide are not consumed and serve as catalysts in
theory. However, in practice, it cannot be avoided that
they are partially lost due to the fact that portions
thereof are dissolved in the liquid fraction from the
second step and in the liquid fraction from the third
step,
