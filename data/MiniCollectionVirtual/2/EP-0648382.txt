<ABSTRACT>
To provide a simple connection between the screened casing (4) and the strip body (1), the spring-loaded side sections (17a to 17d) of the screened casing (4) having firstly inwardly and then outwardly bent spring arms (18a, 18b) are slid over leading and sliding ramps (22) on the strip body (1) and automatically engaged on its plug-in side (front). The adjacent spring arms of each side section (17a to 17d) alternately form contact components (18b) for providing contact between the screen and an assembly plate (11) or sliding and engagement components (18a) to secure the screened casing (4) to the strip body (1). The invention is suitable for motor vehicle filter plug connectors (9, 10).

front of the strip body (1), and having a capacitive 
filter element (6) for a number of plug pins (5), which 

filter element (6) is soldered, on the outside of the 
screened housing (1) opposite the chamber rear, to the 

plug pins (5) on the one hand and to the screened housing 
(4) on the other hand,

spring arms (18a, 18b) which are separated from one 
another and are parallel to one another, 
b) all the spring arms (18a, 18b) are bent inwards from 
the edge of the side parts (17a to 17d),  

 
c) those spring arms (18a, 18b) on each side part (17a 
to 17d) which lie alongside one another alternately form 

contact elements (18b) for making contact with the 
screened housing (4) on a mounting panel (11) and sliding 

and latching elements (18a) for connecting the screened 
housing (4) to the strip body (1), 
d) the contact elements (18b) are bent inwards such 
that they are inclined with respect to the insertion 

direction, 
e) the sliding and latching elements (18a) are bent 
inwards from the side parts (17a to 17d) at right angles, 

are provided with a latching device (21) and are bent 
back, transversely with respect to the insertion direction, 

at their free end to form a radius (20), 
f) the side walls (16) of the strip body (1) are constructed 
with depressions (34) for the contact elements 

(18b) and with lead-in and sliding inclines (22) for the 
sliding and latching elements (18a), in order to expand 

the side parts (17a to 17d) during connection of the 
screened housing (4) and the strip body (1), 
g) after passing over the lead-in and sliding inclines 
(22), the sliding and latching elements (18a) are automatically 

latched, by means of their latching device (21) 
springing inwards, on the latching devices (19) on the 

front of the strip body (1).
