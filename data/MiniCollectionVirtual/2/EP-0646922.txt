<ABSTRACT>
In a cassette (41a;41b) with a memory (MIC) in which 
video data and audio data are digitally recorded: a 

plurality of additional information items are made to 
correspond to one predetermined video image; and a storing 

order of events is properly set and data processes in the 
memory in the case of adding or deleting character 

information are easily executed. Number information 
indicative of the number of text events corresponding to a 

program event is recorded in the program event. The memory 
(MIC) has: a main area in which tape information and the 

like are stored; and an optional area in which table of 
contents (TOC) information, timer recording information, 

character information, and the like are stored. In the 
case where character information regarding the events of 

the optional area exists, the character information is 
stored at the last position of the optional area.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to cassettes with memories.A digital video cassette recorder (VCR) for digitizing
video data and recording onto a magnetic tape is being
developed. Since a transmission band of digital video data
is very wide, for example, a DCT transformation or the like
is performed to the digital video data and, after that, the
video data is recorded onto the magnetic tape.A digital video cassette recorder (VCR) into which a
cassette package having therein a memory or the like can be
loaded has also been proposed. There has also been
proposed an apparatus in which by loading such a cassette
package, signals can be input and output to/from the
digital VCR and a representative still image of a program
recorded on the cassette tape and a tape address and TOC
(Table Of Contents) from which the program is started are
stored into a memory, thereby simplifying the access and
realizing a high speed.The memory provided in the above cassette package
comprises a main area, an optional area, and an unused
area. Its data structure is divided into a main area and
an optional area. The main area is an area in which data
(main event) such as tape information or the like is
recorded. The optional area is an area in which data 
(optional event) such as index information, TOC, and the
like is recorded.U.S. Patents Nos. US-A-4 338 644 and US-A-4 383 285
disclose an arrangement in which a memory loaded in a
recording medium cassette of a VCR stores recording data,
and Japanese Patent Application No. H04-217503 and
corresponding European Patent Application Publication
No. EP-A-0 580 434 disclose such a recording medium
cassette.The character information regarding the recorded video
image is recorded into a text event existing in the memory.
In the case where there is character information, a text
flag provided in the memory is set to "0". In the case
where there is no character information, the text flag is
set to "1". The character information and the text event
correspond in a one-to-one relation.Even in the case where there are a plurality of
character information, the text flag is set to "0".
However, since there is the one-to-one corresponding
relation between the character information and the text
event, a plurality of character information cannot be made
to correspond to one text event. Therefore, a plurality of
character information cannot be added to the recorded video 
image.In the case where the above-mentioned event is
accompanied with character information or the like, a text
event is recorded. In case

<CLAIMS>
A cassette (41a; 41b; 61) having a recording medium in
which video information and audio information are recorded

and also having a memory (MIC;62) in which information
relating to the recording medium is recorded, said

information comprising a plurality of program information
items each comprising character information items,

characterized in that the video information and audio
information are digitally recorded, and in that number

information (TNT) indicative of the plural number of
character information items in a program information item

recorded in said memory (MIC;62) is recorded into that
program information item.
