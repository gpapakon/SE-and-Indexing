<ABSTRACT>
A lifting body (100) moves relative to a fluid, thereby creating a vortex field in the fluid downstream of the lifting body (100). The lifting body (100) has a predetermined lift distribution along the length thereof which enhances the velocity component of the fluid flow directed outwardly from the centroid of the vortex field to reduce the strength of trailing vortices. In a preferred embodiment, the lifting body (100) is a wing (100) with a perturbation (105) proximate to the tip (102) end of the wing planform trailing edge (104).

<DESCRIPTION>
 - J -TITLELIFTING BODY WITH REDUCED-STRENGTH TRAILING VORTICESBACKGROUND OF THE INVENTIONField of the InventionThe present invention relates to lifting bodies and, more particularly, to both aerodynamic (e.g., wings, rotors, flaps, control surfaces) and hydrodynamic (e.g., -submarine sails, bow-planes, stern appendages, propellers) lifting bodies with rapidly dissipated trailing longitudinal vortices.Description of the Prior ArtWing geometry plays an important role in the development of lift in both aerodynamic and hydrodynamic craft. When air or liquid flows over a wing surface, various turbulent flows occur. An increased understanding of the complex underlying structure in these various turbulent flows has led to some level of their control. The -importance ofSUBSTITUTE SHEET 

controlling these turbulent flows can be appreciated by considering some examples.In aircraft, the formation of strong longitudinal vortices, especially behind heavy aircraft developing large lift coefficients, causes large induced transverse wake velocities in the vortices. These vortices thus cause large disturbances after an aircraft has lifted off or landed, and the large airflow velocities in these disturbances can present extremely hazardous conditions for other aircraft subsequently landing or taking off. Accordingly, the Federal Aviation Administration has mandated minimum separation -times between consecutive takeoffs and/or landings and minimum distances between aircraft in flight.In ships, particularly those in which noise reduction is important, such as submarines, trailing vortices can be a significant noise source. For example, the ship's propeller blades can trail vortices, which is a source of noise. In addition, large vortices that can sometimes trail from a submarine sail in certain maneuvers not only create significant noise in themselves but also can affect the flow through the ship's propeller disc and create easily detected secondary noise.Figs. 1 to 4 illustrate the phenomenon of trailing vortices. When fluid flows around a lifting body such as a wing, a vortex field is created in the flow trailing the wing. With a rectangular wing 11, such as that shown in Fig. 1, travelling relative to a fluid at a velocity of Uβ, a single strong longitudinal vortex 12 trails the tip end 13 of the wing. 

In a tapered wing 20, such as that shown in Figure 2, the chord c varies along the length of the wing (along the y-axis) , which can be appreciated from Fig. 3. This variation can be expressed as a function c(y) . As
