<ABSTRACT>
A surgical stent (10) is provided which is formed of a plurality of stent segments (40) having a streamlined contour. Each stent segment (40) includes an outer surface (42) spaced from an inner surface (44). The inner surface (44) is bordered by inner edges (54), (56) and the outer surface (42) is bordered by outer edges (50), (52). The outer edges (50), (52) have a contour defined by outer curves (64), (66) and the inner edges (54), (56) have a contour defined by inner curves (60), (62). Radii of curvature for the inner curves (70), (72) are greater than radii of curvature for the outer curves (64), (66). The inner surface (44) is thus streamlined for passage of blood/bodily fluid (B) adjacent the inner surface (44) and the outer surface (42) is particularly configured for maximum adherence without irritation to an inner surface (S) of a body lumen (L), such as an artery. The surfaces (42), (44) of the stent segment (40) are provided with a surface finish of sufficient smoothness to further enhance blood/fluid flow (B) adjacent the stent segment (40) and to minimize irritation of tissues forming the inner surface (S) of the body lumen (L) in which the surgical stent (10) is implanted.

<DESCRIPTION>
The following invention relates to surgical stents of a generally tubular configuration which can be surgically implanted into a body lumen, such as an artery, and be radially expanded to support the lumen. More specifically, this invention relates to radially expandable surgical stents which exhibit an inner surface which has a streamlined contour and a finely polished surface to minimize disruption of bodily fluid flow through the lumen.Surgical stents have long been known which can be surgically implanted into a body lumen, such as an artery, to reinforce, support, repair or otherwise enhance the performance of the lumen. For instance, in cardiovascular surgery it is often desirable to place a stent in the coronary artery at a location where the artery is damaged or is susceptible to collapse. The stent, once in place, reinforces that portion of the artery allowing normal blood flow to occur through the artery. One form of stent which is particularly desirable for implantation in arteries and other body lumens is a tubular stent which is formed as a complete tubular cylinder and can be radially expanded from a first smaller diameter to a second larger diameter. Such radially expandable stents can be inserted into the artery by being located on a catheter and fed internally through the arterial pathways of the patient until the unexpanded stent is located where desired. The catheter is fitted with a balloon or other expansion mechanism which exerts a radial pressure outward on the stent causing the stent to expand radially to a larger diameter. Such expandable stents exhibit sufficient rigidity after being expanded that they will remain expanded after the catheter has been removed.Radially expandable stents come in a variety of different configurations to provide optimal performance to various different particular circumstances.

Nos. 5,507,771 and 5,314,444), Termin (U.S. Pat. No. 5,496,277), Lane (U.S. Pat. No. 5,494,029), Maeda (U.S. Pat. No. 5,507,767), Marin (U.S. Pat. No. 5,443,477), Khosravi (U.S. Pat.

No. 5,133,732), each include some form of radially expandable stent for implantation into a body lumen.EP-A-0,274,846 discloses a surgical stent
