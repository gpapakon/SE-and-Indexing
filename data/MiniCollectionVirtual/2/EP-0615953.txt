<ABSTRACT>
The present invention relates to a process for the preparation of an aluminium phosphate, characterised in that at least one aluminium compound is reacted with phosphoric acid or an aluminium phosphate, the reaction mixture not comprising anions of an inorganic acid other than phosphoric acid, and the suspension obtained is dried by atomisation (spraying) or lyophilisation. The invention also relates to the aluminium phosphate thus obtained and which is characterised in that it is amorphous and exists in the dry form. The phosphate of the invention can be used as binder, hardener or in the preparation of ceramic components.

obtained is dried by spraying or freeze-drying.
Process according to claim 1, characterized in
that the alumina is obtained by rapid dehydration of

hydrargillite.
Process according to either of claims 1 and 2,
characterized in that the rapid dehydration is carried

out by placing the aluminium hydroxides or oxyhydroxides
in contact with a stream of hot gases for a fraction of

a second to 4 or 5 seconds, the inlet temperature of the
gases ranging between 400 and 1200°C.
