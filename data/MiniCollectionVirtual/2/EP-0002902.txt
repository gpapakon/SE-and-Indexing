<ABSTRACT>
The compound 2-methylthio-6-fluoro-9(1-methyl-4-piperidylidene)-thioxanthene 
of the formula: 


 
and its non-toxic acid addition salts have been shown in 

animal experiment to possess very strong and longlasting 
neuroleptic properties and at the same time, a low degree 

of undesired side effects such as extrapyrimidal side effects. 
They also have a low acute toxicity which makes the therapeutic 

index favourable. 
Moreover, they have strong anticholinergic effects. 
The compound may conveniently be prepared by 
dehydrating 82-methylthio-6-fluoro-9-(1-methyl-4-piperidylidene)-thioxanthen-o1-9 

of the formula: 

 
by conventional means. 
The compound of formula I and its acid addition salts 
may be administered in the form of tablets, capsules, 

powders, syrups, suppositories or solutions for injection.
