<ABSTRACT>
An apparatus for synchronizing a plurality of 
asynchronous circuits during testing operations is 

provided. The apparatus includes first and second clock 
inputs, a test mode input, and an output. The apparatus 

receives a first clock signal from a first clock at the 
first clock input, and a second clock signal from a 

second clock at the second clock input. Responsive to 
the state of a test mode signal at the test mode input, 

the apparatus generates either the first clock signal or 
the second clock signal at the output. A first circuit 

is arranged to be driven by the output of the apparatus, 
while a second circuit is driven by one of the first or 

second clocks. Consequently, the first and second 
circuits are driven by different clocks when the test 

mode signal is in one state, and driven by the same clock 
when the test mode signal is in another state. Because 

the first and second circuits are driven by the same 
clock during testing operations, the timing of the 

communications between the circuits is predictable, 
making it possible to perform certain testing techniques 

that are not possible when the timing of inter-circuit 
communication is not predictable.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an apparatus
for synchronizing a plurality of circuits, and more
specifically for synchronizing a plurality of
asynchronous circuits during testing operations.In many computer systems, not all circuits are
driven by the same clock. Computer systems comprising
circuits driven by different clocks are referred to
herein as asynchronous systems, and intrasystem data
transfers between circuits which are driven by different
clocks are asynchronous. The asynchronous nature of
inter-circuit communications between circuits within a
computer system which are driven by different clocks
makes accurate testing of such asynchronous systems
difficult.Specifically, a testing operation generally
comprises the steps of monitoring actual outputs of a
tested circuit at predetermined times and comparing those
actual outputs of the tested circuit with predetermined
correct outputs. The tested circuit is considered faulty
if the actual outputs do not substantially match the
predetermined correct outputs. For such a testing
operation to work, one must be able to predict exactly
when a valid (non-faulty) circuit will produce particular
outputs.However, the time that an asynchronous system
will produce a given output may vary since the timing of
data transfers within the system between a circuit driven
by one clock and a circuit driven by another clock may
vary. The variance in the timing of such data transfers
may result from, for example, a variance in testing
temperature. A change in testing temperature may affect
the transfer timing between different circuits in 
different ways, depending on the direction and magnitude
of the temperature change and the internal
characteristics of the circuits involved.Another reason for such variance in timing of
data transfers is that such transfers are often effected
upon the coincidence of particular timing, or clock,
signals in two asynchronous circuits; the required
coincidence of two independent clock signals cannot be
predicted with sufficient accuracy to sufficiently
accurately compare actual outputs with predetermined
outputs to reliably test a computer system.That is, if, during testing, the outputs of an
asynchronous system are checked at the wrong times, then
a valid asynchronous system may fail a testing operation,
or a faulty asynchronous system may pass a testing
operation. Testing becomes even more difficult when the
separately-clocked circuits of an asynchronous system
reside on a single integrated circuit chip, since there
is generally no
