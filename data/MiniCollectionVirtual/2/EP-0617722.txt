<DESCRIPTION>
This invention is directed to the field of textile dyeing and in particular
to the dyeing of textiles by the exhaust method using fiber reactive dyes
containing the fiber reactive vinyl sulfone group.The exhaust method of dyeing is a batch method comprising the
immersion of the textile goods in an aqueous solution of dye and various
dyeing auxiliary chemicals. The goods are held in the dye bath for a
predetermined time usually at an elevated temperature until the dye migrates
into and fixes to the fiber. The exhaust dyeing method is well known in the
art of coloring textiles; exemplary exhaust dyeing procedures are beck, jig,
winch, jet and circulating liquor machine procedures.In the exhaust dyeing method using fiber reactive vinyl sulfone dyes,
one necessary auxiliary chemical is an electrolyte which is added to the dye
bath to force the dye to migrate from the solution to the fiber. The most
commonly used electrolyte is an inorganic salt such as sodium sulfate or
sodium chloride. In exhaust dyeing procedures, this electrolyte is generally
employed in amounts from about 20 - 50 grams per liter to about 100 grams
per liter of dye bath with the amount of electrolyte being proportionally higher
as the amount of dye employed in the dyeing increases. However, a few
fiber reactive dyes are known which are used at reduced electrolyte
concentration. After the dyeing process is completed, the exhausted dye
bath solution is discharged to waste water treatment facilities for removal of
electrolyte and other residual dye bath chemicals.The present invention provides a method for the exhaust dyeing of
textiles using a select class of dyes at significantly lower levels of electrolyte
in the dye bath with the attendant reduction in raw materials costs, reduced
chemical discharge to the environment and reduced waste water treatment 
costs. An additional advantage is that the process of the
invention unexpectedly gives a higher dyeing efficiency as
evidenced by the achievement of higher dye build up values.The invention provides a method for the exhaust dyeing
of cellulosic fiber materials using a low salt content dye
bath in conjunction with specific fiber reactive vinyl
sulfone dyes.The method of the invention comprises contacting said
material with an aqueous solution of a dye of the general
formula:

wherein:
M represents a hydrogen atom, or an alkali or alkaline
earth metal; preferred metals are sodium, potassium
and lithium; n and m are 0 or 1;A is a benzene nucleus or a naphthalene nucleus;R is hydrogen or an
