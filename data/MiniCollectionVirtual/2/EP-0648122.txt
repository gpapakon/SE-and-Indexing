<ABSTRACT>
A method of modifying salts of alginic acid (in situ) for prevention and treatment of various intra-articular and extra-articular (spine) complications modifies the alginate (in situ) to an insoluble gel. This (in situ) modification provides a final product which can be compressed within the intra-articular space thus remaining localized. The modified material can have varied mechanical strengths and thus varied degradation times and can serve as a matrix for localizing and slowly releasing therapeutic agents. The modified material is biocompatible and biodegrable, thus requiring no reoperation for removal.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a material which can be placed into intra-articular 
spaces to serve primarily as a space occupier for post-operative intra-articular 
adhesions. More specifically, it relates to a biocompatible and biodegradable 
material which is modified while in the intra-articular space (in situ) to prevent 
adhesions formed post-operatively. Alginic acid was first purified from seaweed in 1896 (British Patent No. 
11,538), and was subsequently commercialized in 1954 by Kelco (Advan. Chem. 
Ser. No. 11., American Chemical Society, Washington, D.C., pp. 68-82). Alginic 
acid, the polysaccharide extracted from the seaweed, is composed of segments of 
D-mannuronic acid units, L-guluronic units, and segments of alternating mannuronic 
and guluronic units. This polysaccharide is most commonly used to thicken 
solutions, stabilize suspensions and emulsions, gel various mixtures, and form films 
on various surfaces. Although alginic acid is water insoluble, the sodium salt of 
alginic acid, sodium alginate, is water soluble. One of the most desirable properties of sodium alginate is its ability to 
complex and form strong gels with divalent cations such as calcium. Calcium 
alginate gels are water insoluble. There is a correlation between the strength of the 
calcium alginate gel and the guluronic acid content of the sodium alginate. Because 
of this characteristic, alginate has been established as a versatile biopolymer for use 
in various biomedical applications. Commercially available wound dressings, such 
as Kaltostat (BritCair Ltd.) and Sorbsan (Steriseal Ltd.), have been manufactured 
from fibers of calcium alginate. Extensive research is being conducted in the area 
of creating artificial organs by entrapping cells within calcium alginate beads and 
implanting them in the body. This same technology has been utilized in the drug 
delivery field. A good example of the use of this encapsulation technology is 
outlined in U.S. Patent 4,744,933 by Rha in 1988. As early as 1947, George Blaine 
presented the idea of using calcium alginate as a method of preventing adhesions  
 
in the surgery of nerves and tendons (Blaine, The Medical Press, August 20, 1947, 
p. 166). Subsequently, sodium alginate solution was shown to be effective in 
prevention of adhesions in the peritoneal cavity following laparotomy procedures 
(Japanese Patent SH057-167919). More recently, ester derivatives of sodium 
alginate have been developed and mentioned as potential anti-adhesions materials 
(European Patent
