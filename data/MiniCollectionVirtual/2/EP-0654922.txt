<ABSTRACT>
The possibility of passing off apparent "good" higher level digital
signals that may include corrupted or failed lower level digital signals because of

inter-ring grooming of the lower level digital signals from a bidirectional line-switched
ring to a path-switched ring and vice versa which employ first and second

shared nodes is minimized by dual feeding communications circuits from the
bidirectional line-switched ring to the path-switched ring and vice versa via the

shared nodes. An inter-ring groomed communications circuit is provisioned from a
secondary ring node in the line-switched ring of one of the shared nodes (secondary

communications circuit) to be supplied to a primary ring node in the other of the
shared nodes of the line-switched ring. A replica of the secondary communications

circuit is demultiplexed to obtain the lower level digital signals, which are evaluated
on a pair-wise basis with corresponding lower level digital signals from the primary

ring node. The least corrupted of the evaluated lower level signals are selected to be
combined into a new primary communications circuit which is to be inserted in the

line-switched transmission path. An inter-ring groomed communications circuit is
provisioned from a secondary ring node of one of the shared nodes in the path-switched

ring to be supplied to a primary ring node in the other shared node of the
path-switched ring. The secondary communications circuit is demultiplexed to

obtain the lower level signals which are evaluated on a pair-wise basis with lower
level signals from a corresponding primary communications circuit to determine

which of the lower level signals are least corrupted. The selected least corrupted
lower level signals are combined into a new primary communications circuit which

is then dual fed in the path-switched ring primary ring node.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to ring transmission systems and, more particularly, to interworking between bidirectional line-switched ring transmission systems and path-switched ring transmission systems.It has become increasingly important to maintain communications connectivity in the presence of transmission system failures. To this end, ring interworking arrangements have been proposed in e.g. US 5 218 604, for transporting communications circuits between bidirectional line-switched rings and between path-switched rings. Ring interworking is essentially a dual feed of communications circuits from a first ring to a second ring. The dual feeding takes place across two different sites, each with ring nodes for both the first and second rings, in order to provide the physical diversity necessary to enable the cross-ring communications circuits to survive a failure of one of the two shared sites. The second ring performs a receive switch based on some parameter or set of parameters of the two signals being fed from the first ring. For the other direction of the same end-to-end cross-ring communications circuits, the second ring dual feeds communications circuits to the first ring. The first ring performs a receive switch of the two signals being fed from the second ring.A problem arises when there is a need to groom the inter-ring communications traffic by way of intervening wide-band digital cross-connect systems (DCS), multiplexers (MUX) or the like, where the grooming is being done at a different digital signal level, i. e., bit rate, than is being used in the rings. Examples are DS1 digital signals in DS3 signals and VT SONET signals in STS-1 SONET signals. In such arrangements, if a failure occurs incoming to the DCS, MUX or other grooming apparatus from one ring, it will not be recognized by the other ring because the inter-ring grooming apparatus will only insert the DS 1 or VT failure indication and not the DS3 or STS-1 failure indication. Consequently, the inter-ring groomed signals, i.e., DS3s or STS-1s, passed off to either ring could appear to be "good" but could, in fact, contain corrupted or failed lower level digital signals, i.e., DS1s or VTs.One attempt at avoiding the problems associated with inter-ring grooming of lower level digital signals in the higher level digital signals employed in interworking path-switched rings is described in a contribution to T1 Standards Project T1X1.2 entitled "SWB Ring Interconnection Architecture Issues and Proposed Interim Solutions", T1X1.2/93-013, dated
