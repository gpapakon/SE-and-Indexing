<ABSTRACT>
A nucleic acid is rapidly extracted from 
whole blood by mixing the sample with a salt solution 

containing a polysaccharide followed by heating the 
mixture at or near the boiling point of water for a few 

minutes. The extracted nucleic acid can be recovered, 
if desired, or used immediately in polymerase chain 

reaction. This rapid method is particularly useful for 
extracting DNA for the detection of genetic diseases or 

infectious agents, such as HIV-I.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method for
rapidly extracting a nucleic acid, such as DNA, from
whole blood. It also relates to a method for
amplifying or detecting the extracted nucleic acid for
diagnostic purposes.Within the field of biological diagnostics,
research and analytical procedures require the
investigation of nucleic acids from biological
specimens, such as whole blood or fractions thereof.
Such invitro procedures require as a first step, the
isolation of the nucleic acids. For example,
relatively pure samples of genomic DNA are required in
order to perform tests for genetic diseases, and
recombinant technology requires isolation of both the
vector DNA and the DNA to be cloned. In the detection
of infectious agents, such as bacteria and virally
infected cells, DNA diagnostic procedures generally
require cell lysis followed by detection of the
released DNA.Generally, DNA does not exist as a free molecule
in a cell, but instead exists as a complex association
of DNA, RNA and proteins. This is a consequence of the
role of DNA as the carrier of genetic information, and
its involvement with RNA and various proteins in that
function.Because of this complex association of DNA with
other materials in a specimen, effective DNA extraction
requires that: the DNA be released through disrupted
cell walls and membranes, DNA-protein complexes be
dissociated by denaturation or proteolysis, and DNA be
separated from other macromolecules. Various means are
used in the art to accomplish one or more of these 
results. Cell lysis can be accomplished, for example,
by freeze-thawing ultrasonic means, shearing and other
mechanical techniques, or by treatment with enzymes,
surfactants or chelating agents. Proteases and other
hydrolyzing agents can be used to dissociate DNA from
proteins. Residual proteins and other macromolecules
can be extracted using various solvents, such as phenol
or other alcohols.Some DNA isolation techniques are described in,
for example, EP-A-0 145 356, EP-A-0 240 191, and EP-A-0
245 945, all of which use an alcohol and an enzymatic
protein decomposer in certain sequences of steps.
Generally, these procedures are directed to the
extraction of viral DNA and involve a number of
complicated steps which must be carried out with
precision in order to obtain all available DNA. Thus,
many of the known processes are labor intensive,
require the use of undesirable solvents and are not
readily automated.Isolation or extraction of the nucleic acid of
interest is necessary to take advantage of

<CLAIMS>
A method for the rapid extraction of a nucleic acid
from a specimen of whole blood consisting solely of the

steps of:

A. mixing a whole blood specimen with a salt
solution comprising one or more polysaccharides, and
B. subjecting the mixture resulting from step A to
heat at a temperature at or near the boiling point of water

for from two to fifteen minutes to lyse the cells in the
mixture to release a nucleic acid from the cells.
The method of claim 1, wherein the extracted nucleic
acid is recovered from the heated sample.
The method of claim 1, wherein the extracted nucleic
acid is subjected to a polymerase chain reaction, without

recovery from the heated sample, for amplifying a
predetermined nucleic acid.
The method of claim 3, wherein said polymerase chain
reaction comprises the steps of:


A. contacting the extracted nucleic acid with first
and second primers which are complementary to the separated

strands of the predetermined nucleic acid so as to form
hybridized products of the primers and the complementary

strands,
B. forming first and second extension products of
the primers in the hybridized products, which extension

products, when separated from their complements, can serve
as templates for synthesis of extension products of the

primers,
C. separating the primer extension products from the
templates on which they were synthesized,
D. contacting the separated extension products and
the predetermined nucleic acid with additional first and

second primers, resulting in amplification of the nucleic 
acid to form complementary products, and
E. separating the primer extension products from the
complementary products formed in step D.

includes the step of detecting the amplified nucleic acid as
an indication of the presence of the nucleic acid in the

aqueous sample.

amplification or detection of HIV-I DNA.
The method of any one of claims 1 to 6, wherein the
salt solution further comprises a nonionic surfactant.
The method of any one of claims 1 to 7, wherein the
polysaccharide is a dextran.
The method of any one of claims 1 to 8, wherein the
nucleic acid is extracted from a dried whole blood specimen.
The method of any one of claims 1 to 9, wherein
heating is carried out for from four to twelve minutes at a

temperature of from 95° to 120°C.
