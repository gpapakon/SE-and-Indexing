strength, good oxidation resistance and excellent  

 
resistance to sulfate corrosion. It may also be hardly 

affected by the thermal history and have excellent 
strength stability and hardness stability. 

Furthermore, the alloy may have a relatively low 
specific gravity and be advantageous in specific 

strength.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a Ni-based alloy which 
can be superior in oxidation resistance, high-temperature 
strength, stability to thermal history, etc. and can have an 
improved resistance to sulfate corrosion. Research and development are being made 
actively on alloys superior in high-temperature strength, 
oxidation resistance, etc. for their use as a material for 
gas turbines, engine parts, heaters, electric furnaces, etc. 
For example, a Fe-based alloy typified by Kanthal alloy (Fe- 
21Cr-5.5Al) is known as an alloy having a higher oxidation 
resistance than stainless steel. Further, a Ni-based super 
alloy such as Inconel X-750 [Ni-15Cr-7Fe-0.7Al-2.5Ti-1(Nb+Ta)] 
is known as an alloy having a high strength at 
high temperatures. Furthermore, a Ni-Cr-Al alloy containing 
not more than 5% by weight of Al, typified by a Haynes 214 
alloy (Ni-16Cr-4.5Al-2Fe) is known as an alloy having a high 
strength at high temperatures and an oxidation resistance. 
Also, Ni₃Al is known as an intermetallic compound having a 
high strength at high temperatures.  Further, in Japanese Patent Application Kokai 
(Laid-Open) No. 358037/1992 is disclosed, as a Ni-based 
heat-resistant alloy having an excellent high-temperature 
strength and an excellent corrosion resistance, a Ni-based 
heat-resistant alloy which comprises not more than 0.01% (by 
weight) of C, not more than 1.0% of Si, not more than 0.2% 
of Mn, more than 5% but not more than 18% of Cr, 4.5-12% of 
Al, at least one element selected from B (0.001-0.03%), Zr 
(0.01-0.3%), Hf (0.05-1.0%), Ti (0.05-1.0%) and Mg (0.001-0.02%), 
and the remainder of Ni or Ni, Fe (not more than 5%) 
and unavoidable impurities. Further in Japanese Patent Application Kokai 
(Laid-Open) No. 86840/1988 is disclosed a Ni-Fe-Al alloy 
which has a high yield strength at high temperatures, a good 
ductility, a good oxidation resistance and good high-temperature 
processability. Also in U.S. Patent No. 4,359,352 is disclosed a 
boron-containing Ni-based super alloy produced by rapid 
solidification. The above alloys, however, have respective problems. 
That is, the Fe-based alloy (e.g. Kanthal alloy) has 
a relatively small strength and a relatively small hardness 
at high temperatures. The Ni-based super alloy such as  
 
Inconel X-750 contains Ta, Nb, W, Mo and Co for strength 
improvement; however, these elements are strategic elements 
and have problems of high cost and unstable supply, etc. In 
addition, while in such a super alloy, the oxidation resistance 
is exhibited
