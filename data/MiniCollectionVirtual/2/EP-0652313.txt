<ABSTRACT>
The device has a warp stop motion (2) which is designed as a subassembly and which has at least two bobbin holders (5) which are equipped with leno bobbins (4) and which are connected to the subassembly (2) and are combined with the latter to form a unit. The warp threads and leno threads (6) can thus be drawn in beforehand and the article change carried out with leno threads drawn in, thereby advantageously reducing the outlay in terms of the article change and the standstill time of the weaving machine.
