<ABSTRACT>
A method is disclosed for the production of integral skin foam from a liquid skeleton substance like plastic or inorganic material. The liquid skeleton substance is brought into a chamber and a sonochemical process is brought about, in order to dissolve at least an inert, non-flammable gas as well as a low amount of a hydrocarbon fluid in the liquid skeleton substance. Only said inert, non-flammable gas serves to foam up the skeleton substance by energy supply; the hydrocarbon fluid promotes the formation of the usual dense outer skin of the integral skin foam. The method allows to achieve an optimal density and pore distribution within the integral skin foam.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a method for the production of 
integral skin foam according to the preamble of claim 1. One such type of method is known from DE 32 26 818 A1. During 
this known method conventional devices are used for 
the measurement of gas and gas loading. After a measurement 
of density of a mixture sample which was taken from a machine 
container, or in a bypass the gas loading done at 
another position is controlled on the basis of this measurement. 
The addition of the gas occurs also in a bypass, 
for example, parallel to a return pipe-line coming from a 
mixer casing in the vicinity of a machine tank. The gas addition 
in the bypass is done by a capillary tube introduced 
into the pipe-line and a Venturi-tube. The control of gas 
loading can be done manually or with the help of a computer. 
The application of the Venturi-principle makes this 
known method difficult to control because the amount of gas 
loading is heavily dependent on an interface tension between 
liquid and gas, wherein high interface tension means 
small bubbles of the absorbed gas in the liquid and wherein 
low interface tension means large bubbles of the absorbed 
gas. In addition to that the known method working according 
to the Venturi-principle is high energy consuming because 
the flow in the pipe, in which the Venturi-device is situated, 
must have a high speed, so that the gas loading resulting 
according to the type of a water jet blast can function 
at all. Finally it is disadvantageous in the case of 
the known method, that relatively high quantities of foaming 
agent, among others hydrocarbon fluids, are necessary.  
 Another known method is, for example, mechanical frothing. 
In this case foaming agent, air and gelling agent are fed 
to a plastic serving as a skeleton substance and a homogeneous 
mixture is produced by a mixer (vide A.M. Wittfoth, 
Kunststofftechnisches Wörterbuch, Carl Hanser Verlag München 
Wien, Part 3, page 146, 1978). The mixture is then 
poured into a mould. In a subsequent heating operation the 
mixture expands and solidifies, so that a foamed product is 
produced. Therein a foaming agent in the form of azo or 
diazo-compounds is always added, which sets free N2 or CO2, 
when the foaming agent decomposes under gas formation in 
the heating operation subsequent to the mixing and thus 
leads to the foaming up of the skeleton substance and to 
the formation of foam. In the case of some foaming agents 
no heating process is necessary, as they decompose even at 
room temperature.

A method for the production of integral skin foam from a 
liquid skeleton substance like plastic or inorganic material, 

which is foamed up by at least one inert, non-flammable 
gas, which is set free by energy supply, whereby the 

inert, non-flammable gas together with a low quantity of 
hydrocarbon fluid is added to the liquid skeleton substance 

and whereby only the inert, non-flammable gas serves during 
the energy supply for the foaming up of the skeleton substance 

and the hydrocarbon fluid promotes the formation of 
a dense outer skin of the integral skin foam, characterized 

in that the liquid skeleton substance is brougth into a 
chamber and a sonochemical process is brought about, in order 

to dissolve the gases in the liquid skeleton substance, 
and the addition of hydrocarbon fluid is less than 1% by 

vol. of the inert gas and the liquid skeleton substance and 
consists of cyclobutane, cyclohexane, cyclopentane or a 

mixture thereof. 
The method according to claim 1, characterized in that 
the hydrocabon fluid is an azeotropic mixture of several 

hydrocarbons.

in that the inert, non-flammable gas is carbondioxide, nitrogen, 

argon, helium or an azeotropic mixture thereof.

a liquid skeleton substance substantially as hereinbefore 

described.
