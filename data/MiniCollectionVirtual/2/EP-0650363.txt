<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to combinations of antiviral agents. More
specifically it is concerned with combinations of 1,3-oxathiolane nucleoside
analogues with other antiviral agents, in particular agents effective against HIV.Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) causes a variety of clinical conditions
including the acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) and chronic
neurological disorders. Nucleosides such as AZT, ddC and ddI inhibit HIV
replication in vitro, and appear to exert their antiviral activity on the
virus-encoded reverse transcriptase enzyme after metabolism by the cell to their
5'-triphosphate derivatives.AZT reduces morbidity and mortality in patients with AIDS. However, HIV
infection of cells results in integration of the virus genome into the host
chromosome, and so it has been necessary to continue AZT treatment for long
periods of time. The consequences of long-term AZT therapy are associated
bone-marrow toxicity and the appearance of AZT-resistant variants of HIV-1.
Similarly, some AIDS patients treated with ddC develop peripheral neuropathy
and ddI has been shown to induce pancreatitis and peripheral neuropathy.The use of combinations of compounds may give rise to an equivalent antiviral
effect with reduced toxicity, or an increase in drug efficacy if synergy between
compounds occurs. Lower overall drug doses will possibly also reduce the
frequency of occurrence of drug-resistant variants of HIV. Many different
methods have been used to examine the effects of combinations of compounds
acting together in different assay systems. All of these methods have limitations
and for example, some methods have been applied to systems other than those
for which they were derived. AZT demonstrates synergistic antiviral activity in
vitro in combination with agents that act at HIV-1 replicative steps other than
reverse transcription, including recombinant soluble CD4 castanospermine and
recombinant interferon alpha. However, it must be noted that combinations of
compounds can give rise to increased cytotoxicity. AZT and recombinant 
interferon alpha have an increased cytotoxic effect on normal human bone
marrow progenitor cells.The compound (2R, cis)-4-amino-1-(2-hydroxymethyl-1,3-oxathiolan-5-yl) -(1H)-pyridmidin-2-one,
also known as 3TC, is currently undergoing clinical trials for
the treatment of conditions associated with infection by HIV.We have now found that 3TC exhibits unexpected advantages when used in
combination with certain non-nucleoside inhibtors of HIV replication.There is thus
