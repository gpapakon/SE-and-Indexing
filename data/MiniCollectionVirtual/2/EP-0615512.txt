<ABSTRACT>
A universal active propulsion and spraying system and related propulsion and spraying elements, e.g. for aerosols, including a conventional housing (1) with a spray tip, comprising a duct (3) extending into the lower portion (4) of the housing (1) for expelling the product, and a nozzle (5) in the upper portion (6) of the housing for expelling the gas. The system comprises a first propulsion element including a lower portion (7) and an upper portion (8), said lower portion (7) having a smaller internal diameter than said upper portion (8) whereby a shoulder (9) is formed within the first propulsion element (17) for dividing the upper (8) and lower (7) portions into two separate compartments when the spray tip (2) is depressed and engages a second propulsion element. The upper portion further comprises an edge (00) for holding the first propulsion element onto a plug, and a rim (000) for locking a seal (20) against the plug. The gas expelled through hole (15) is mixed with the product expelled through hole (16) in the end portion (0) of the duct, and the product is sprayed out.
