<ABSTRACT>
A backrest (10) which can be fitted on a lifting plate of a lift assembly has a foot (12) and a plate (14) which can be pivoted on the latter about a pivoting axis (34) and forms the backrest. On the back, a transversely extending support wall (44) is attached or moulded onto the plate (14) with sufficient distance from the pivoting axis (34). Arranged between the support wall (44) and the bottom (24) of the foot (12) is a piece of tube (16) which lies transversely, is arranged parallel to the pivoting axis (34), is closed at the end, and is connected via a hand control valve to the compressed-water system of the lift assembly. By filling the piece of tube (16), the plate (14) is raised via the support wall (44) into a steep position, even if the upper body of a user is loading the plate (14). By letting off compressed water in a controlled manner, the plate (14) moves infinitely variably into different positions of inclination right into a flat inclined position in which a rear attachment of the plate (14) strikes against the foot (12).

A backrest for a bathtub lift assembly with a plate (14), as the chair back, pivotable on a 
lifting plate of the lift assembly, and an adjusting device adjusting the inclination of the 

plate (14) and having a hose member (16) closed at the ends, fillable with pressurised 
water, arranged on the back of the plate, made of substantially non-expandable material 

and connected to a multiway manual control valve, 
characterized in that
 the plate (14) 
is mounted on a foot (12) attachable to the lifting plate of the lifting assembly, that a 

chamber, at least most of which is closed, is formed between the plate (14) and the foot 
(12), and the hose member (16) is positioned so as to be mounted securely in the 

chamber at a distance from the plate (14) and its bottom is supported on the foot (12), 
and that the back of the plate (14) has a supporting wall (44) extending parallel to the 

plate pivotal axle (34) at a distance therefrom at least over the largest part of the length 
of the hose member (16) and with its bottom, at least in the central region, having a 

concave arch (46) having a wide surface resting on the hose member (16) and being 
adapted to the diameter of the hose member (16) filled with pressurised water at the 

bottom at least in the central area. 
A backrest according to Claim 1, 
characterised in that
 the supporting wall (44) is 
connected to two downwardly pointing side walls (20) of the plate (14). 
A backrest according to one of the Claims 1 or 2, 
characterised in that
 the tangential 
plane of the resting surface of the supporting wall (44) intersects at least approximately 

the axle of the pivoting bearing (34) of the plate (14). 
A backrest according to any one of Claims 1 to 3, 
characterized in that
 the chamber in 
the region of the foot is bounded by an upright back wall (28) and also upright side walls 

(26), and that a box opening downwards is provided on the rear side of the plate (14) 
and its side walls (20) and back wall (22) point downwards and overlap those of the foot 

(12) at least in the gradual sloping position of the plate (14). 
A backrest according to Claim 4, 
characterized in that
 the box of the plate (14) opening 
downwards covers the outside of the side walls (26) and the back wall (28) of the foo
t 
(12). 
A backrest according to any one of Claims 1-5, 
characterised in that
 the resting surface  
 

of the supporting wall (44) is substantially horizontal in the gradual sloping position of 
the plate (14). 
A backrest according to any one of Claims 4-6, 
characterized in that
 the back of the 
plate (14) has a partition wall (50) having a stop surface arranged at a distance from the 

plate (14) and supported in the gradual sloping position of the plate (14) on one of the 
upright walls (26, 28) of the foot (12).
