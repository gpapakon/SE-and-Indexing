<ABSTRACT>
A multicolumn press or similar press system for forming sheet-metal parts has a press table (3), a plurality of press columns (6), a press ram (7) which can be moved up and down by the press drive via drive boxes (11) and connecting rods (17), and tools (8) in follow-on stages (2) which follow a drawing stage (1). In order to reduce the size of the press system, the press ram (7) extends over at least two column areas (6) and the introduction of force into the press ram (7) via the connecting rods (17) takes place in the column areas (6).

<CLAIMS>
Multi-column press for forming sheet-metal parts,
having a press table (3) or press tables, press columns

(6), a press ram (7), driven by the press drive (11, 19,
20), and tools (8) which are fastened on said ram and on

the press table, as well as waste shafts (21) which are
assigned to the tools, characterized in that the press

ram (7) extends over three column regions (6) or column
pairs (12), and in that the initiation of force (18)

takes place in each column region (6) via the connecting
rod (17), which is articulated on the press ram (7), or

similar articulation means.
Multi-column press according to Claim 1, characterized
in that, for each column region (6) or column

pair (12), in each case two connecting rods or similar
articulation means are positioned on the press ram (7).
Multi-column press according to Claim 1 or 2,
characterized in that the gearboxes (11) with driving,

moving and deflecting means for the ram drive are each
placed on a mutually opposite press-column pair (12) and

fastened thereon.
Multi-column press according to one or more of
the preceding claims, characterized in that at least the

press column in the region of the central point of
initiation of force into the press ram (7) has two tie

rods (13) and, accordingly, two tie-rod sleeves (14), and
in that the centres of the tie rods (13) of each

respective column pair (12) are arranged on a common line
(16).
Multi-column press according to one or more of 
the preceding claims, characterized in that the connecting

rods (17) acting on the press ram (7), i.e. the point
of initiation of force (18) into the press ram (7), act

on the common line (16) assigned to each respective
column pair (12).
Multi-column press according to one or more of
the preceding claims, characterized in that the column

region (6) is designed to be narrower than, and at most
equal to, the width of the waste shaft (21), as measured

in the direction of passage through the press.
