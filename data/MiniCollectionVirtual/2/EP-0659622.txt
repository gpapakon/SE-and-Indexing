<ABSTRACT>
In a dual-line brake system, a restrictor (80, 87) with a variable cross-section is arranged in the trailor supply line (42, 15) leading from a tractor vehicle to a trailor vehicle. If a trailor brake line connecting the brake system of the tractor vehicle to the brake system of the trailor vehicle breaks, the flow of compressed air from the compressed air source (45, 43) of the tractor vehicle towards the brake system of the trailor vehicle is throttled by means of the throttle (80, 87) in order to permit automatic braking of the trailor vehicle. The throttle (80, 87) has a first control element (60) serving for its actuation and a second control element (80) serving as a throttling piston for the purpose of throttling the flow of compressed air. When the brake is operated, the throttle (80, 87) is moved from its unthrottled first operating position into a defined second operating position by means of the first control element (60). If the trailor brake line (7) breaks, the second control element (80), designed as a throttling piston, is moved by the difference which arises between the pressures at the inlet (41) and the outlet (24) of the throttle (80, 87) into a position in which the cross-section of the throttle (80, 87) is reduced.
