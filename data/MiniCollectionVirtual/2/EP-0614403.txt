 PROCESS FOR REMOVINGCONTAMINANTS FROM POLYOIiEFINS FOR RECYCLEDescription Technical FieldThe present invention is concerned with removing certai contaminants from polyolefins and especially concerned wit removing polyester and cellulosic contaminants including cotto and paper from the polyolefin. The decontamination process o the present invention can be carried out without employin organic solvents. The process of the present invention i accomplished without degradation of the treated polymer to an significant degree.Background ArtPolyolefins and particularly polymonoolefins such as polypropylene are used as bale wrappers, for example, fo baling cotton fibers and polyester fibers. In order to recycl the polyolefins such must be adequately cleaned, which includes removing certain contaminants including polyesters an cellulosic materials such as cotton and paper. Sometimes, lo levels of such contaminants may be removed during mel processing by screen packs positioned at the end of an extrude barrel. However, in these bale-wrappers, the presence of bot polyester and cellulosic (cotton and paper fibers) creates unique problem. The cellulosic fibers degrade at temperatures required to melt-process polyesters, and at lower temperatures the cellulosic and polyester fibers cause plugging of the filter screens used in extruding the recycled polymer. Mechanical methods that have been attempted have failed to giv good separations. In addition, washing with water, with o without detergent, is not a satisfactory approach. Furthermore, difficulties have been encountered in achieving 

 satisfactory process since the customers for reprocessable, reusable polyolefins have high specifications that are close to those for the original polyolefin material.Summary of InventionThe present invention is concerned with a process for removing polyester and cellulosic contaminants from polyolefins. The process of the present invention provides for the degradation of polyester and cellulosic contaminants without adversely effecting the properties of the polyolefins. Moreover, the degraded materials are readily removable from the polyolefin. The process of the present invention preferably employs aqueous compositions and does not require the use of organic solvents. The chemicals employed pursuant to the present invention are commercially available, relatively inexpensive, reasonably safe to handle, safe to mix, and water soluble.More particularly, the process of the present invention comprises contacting a polyolefin
