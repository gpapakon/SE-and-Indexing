portion of claim 1, and to a digital signal processing
circuit, according to the opening portion of claim 6.It is necessary to use a pseudorandom noise for a predetermined
process in a signal processing unit processing a time
series digital data, in addition to processing a normal input
data. In the field of audio units, there are applications such
as the Dolby pro-logic to be obligated to have the pseudo-random
noise generative function for setting up an output
level of peripheral equipments such as speakers.From EP-A1-498 534 an artificial random-number pattern generating
circuit is known which can be used for a pseudorandom
noise generation. This document discloses a circuitry with a pseudo random noise generative
function comprising a shift register and having an exclusive OR gate being
electrically connected to said shift register for fetching outputs from said shift
register, said exclusive OR gate having two inputs being electrically connected to
said shift register for receipt of a most significant bit and a second bit from said
most significant bit of said shift register, respectively and supplying exclusive
ORed data to said shift register for use of generating a pseudo random noise and

to be processed therein and an output of said exclusive OR gate for fetching said
digital data and said exclusive ORed data respectively to select said serial digital
data or said exclusive ORed data in response to a selective signal, said switch
being electrically connected to said shift register for supplying said serial digital
data or said exclusive ORed data to said shift register, thereby selecting a
boundary scanning buffering processing mode or a pseudo random number
generation mode. However, it would be desirable to provide a
better adaptability to the needs of digital signal processing.From EP-A2-196 152 a method for testing digital integrated
circuits is known. This method also uses a pseudo-random number
generator.
The proposed method is intended
for testing PLAs.A linear feedback shift register has been well known as the
pseudorandom noise generative unit and disclosed in the Japanese
laid-open publications Nos. 63-82014 and 63-250210. The
linear feedback shift register comprises a circuit in which
flip-flops are serially connected to compose a shift register
and some outputs of the flip-flops are
