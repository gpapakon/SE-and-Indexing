<ABSTRACT>
An optical fibre connector is shown comprising a jack (2) mounted to a mother board (100) and a plug (102) mounted to a daughter board (101). The plug (102) has a slidable insert (106) retained by thrust lances (150) against a shoulder (152) of the plug housing (104) such that the insert (106) can be inserted into a cavity (213) of the jack (2). Latches (291) of the jack (2) serve to latch onto ribs (128) of the plug insert (106) so as to butt a ferrule (116) of the plug against a ferrule (12) of the jack resiliently together. Further insertion of the insert (106) into the jack causes ribs (248) to release the thrust lances (150) of the plug insert (106) such that the insert springs rearwards allowing the plug housing (104) to slide forwards without spring resistance, enabling absorption of a certain tolerance in the spacing between the daughter board (101) and the mother board (100).

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a mechanism for latching an
optical fibre connector and, in particular, a latching
mechanism for a connector making optical connection
between a panel or mother board and a circuit board.It is relatively common in the electronics industry,
to transfer signals by way of an optical fibre due to a
number of advantages that light transmission has over
transmission of electrical signals, namely the very high
transmission rate of signals and the insensitivity of
light signals to electrical and magnetic fields. One
common example of high speed data transmission is between
substrate boards with printed electrical circuits thereon,
whereby it is often desirable to have both electrical and
optical connection between the boards, this connection
often occurring between a mother board and daughter
boards.An optical fibre cable is typically built up of an
inner core surrounded by cladding and, therearound, fibres
for reinforcement and, further, a protective plastic
insulation. The core carries all or most of the light and
is usually made of glass or plastic, whereby the diameter
of this core may even be as small as two to eight microns.
The cladding surrounding the core is typically made of
plastic or glass and serves to keep the light within the
inner core due to the specifically chosen, and different,
refraction indexes of the core and cladding, whereby the
outer diameter of this cladding may be around twenty to
one hundred and twenty five microns. The very small
diameter of the inner, light transmitting core means that
great accuracy is needed when coupling two optical fibres
together. This is achieved by feeding the core and cladding
through the bore of a precisely manufactured ferrule and
holding it therein by bonding, the optical fibre
projecting through the tip of the ferrule, and the tip of 
the ferrule is then finely polished so that the optical
fibre is flush to the tip of the ferrule. The ferrule is
then inserted into a precisely manufactured sleeve which
accurately centers and aligns the ferrule, whereby the
ferrule of another optical cable can be introduced through
the other end of the sleeve until both ferrule tips butt
against each other in accurate alignment. It is also
important to ensure that the gap between the tips of
connecting optical fibres is as small as possible and
remains constant, thus requiring that the ferrules press
against each other. This is achieved by springs mounted in
the optical fibre connector and pushing against the
ferrule. The spring also absorbs the

A fibre optic connector assembly comprising a jack assembly for
receiving, at one side thereof, at least one jack ferrule (12), and a plug

assembly (102,132) insertable into the jack assembly from the opposite side
thereof and having at least one plug ferrule (116) positionable coaxially with

said jack ferrule for optically interconnecting optical fibres supported by the
ferrules (12,116); said plug assembly comprising an outer housing (104), an

inner plug body (106) slidably mounting the plug ferrule(s) and slideable axially within
a through cavity (111) of the outer housing, and spring means (112) for

resiliently urging the plug ferrule(s) towards the cooperating jack ferrule(s),
said inner plug body (106) having radially deflectable outer thrust means

(150) for abutting a forward facing shoulder (152) of the outer housing (104)
so as to enable insertion of the plug assembly into the jack assembly by

movement of the outer housing forwardly into the jack assembly, said outer
housing (104) having an opening (127) at the forward end thereof and said

inner plug body (106) having outer plug latching means (128) facing said
opening (127) for cooperation with the jack assembly (204); and said jack

assembly (204) comprising jack latching means (284) cooperating, via the
opening (127), with the plug latching means, in response to the plug

assembly reaching a predetermined axial position within the jack assembly,
for retaining the inner plug body in the jack assembly for optical

interconnection of the optical fibres, and thrust disengagement means (248)
for radially inwardly deflecting said thrust means to a position clear from said

shoulder (152) when said plug assembly is moved further forwardly beyond
said predetermined axial position, whereby the outer housing (104) alone is

further axially movable over a tolerance absorption distance (T) with respect
to the optically and mechanically connected jack assembly (204) and inner plug body (106),

said further axial movement not influencing the force exerted by the spring
means (112),

facing shoulder (152) at a rear end thereof and a bridge portion (131) protruding

into the cavity (111) of the outer housing (104) at a forward end of the

housing, and the jack latching means (284) and the thrust disengagement
