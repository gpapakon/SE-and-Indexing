<ABSTRACT>
The present invention provides a silicone rubber 
composition for fixing roll service. More specifically, the 

invention relates to a silicone rubber composition for 
fixing roll service that is easily molded into a fixing roll 

as used in devices such as electrophotographic copiers, 
facsimile machines, and laser printers and that yields a 

fixing roll with an excellent mechanical strength and 
excellent toner release properties.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a silicone
rubber composition for fixing roll service that is
easily molded into a fixing roll as used in devices
such as electrophotographic copiers, facsimile
machines, and laser printers and that yields a fixing
roll with an excellent mechanical strength and
excellent toner release properties.Contact thermal fixing is widely used in the
devices described above. In a typical process, the
toner image, after its electrophotographic formation on
a photoreceptor and transfer to copy paper, is fixed by
a fixing roll. The fixing rolls used for contact
thermal fixing are fabricated by coating a silicone
rubber composition on the circumference of a metal
shaft and then curing the composition.The prior art of silicone rubber compositions
for fixing roll service are exemplified by the
following:
(i) the silicone rubber composition of JP-A 57-149354
[149,354/1982], which consists of alkenyl-containing
organopolysiloxane with a viscosity of 100 to 100,000
mPa.s (centipoise) at 25°C, organohydrogenpolysiloxane
with a viscosity of 1 to 5,000 mPa.s (centipoise) at
25°C, inorganic filler, alkenyl-free organopolysiloxane
with a viscosity of 10 to 5,000 mPa.s (centipoise) at
25°C, and platinum catalyst; (ii) the silicone rubber composition of JP-A 63-186024
[186,024/1988], which consists of organopolysiloxane
that contains at least 2 alkenyl groups in each
molecule, organopolysiloxane resin that contains at
least 2 silicon-bonded hydrogen atoms in each molecule,
and platinum catalyst; and(iii) the silicone rubber composition of JP-A 4-164741
[164,741/1992], which consists of polyorganosiloxane
that contains at least 2 vinyl groups in each molecule
and has a viscosity at 25°C of 500 to 500,000 mPa.s
(centipoise), organohydrogensiloxane that contains at
least 3 silicon-bonded hydrogen atoms in each molecule,
inorganic filler, and a platinum compound.However, the silicone rubber compositions for
fixing roll service taught in this art contain an
inorganic filler such as silica micropowder, quartz
powder, and so forth. Fixing rolls obtained therefrom
suffer from a gradual decline in their toner release
properties with increasing copy mileage, and it
eventually becomes impossible to obtain clear copies.
In contrast, silicone rubber compositions for fixing
roll service that lack an inorganic filler yield fixing
rolls with a low mechanical strength that will not
support practical applications. The present invention introduces an inorganic
filler-free silicone rubber composition for fixing roll
