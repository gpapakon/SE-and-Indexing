<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a fibrous strip of multiple width, which consists of crimped interlaced filaments and which has a plurality of regions extending in the longitudinal direction of the fibre strip and at least one predetermined tearing line (4) extending in the longitudinal direction of the fibre strip, the tearing force (daN) of the fibre strip, related to the total linear density (dtex), amounting to at least approximately 1.7 x 10

 daN/dtex (determined with reference to DIN 53 834 T1, February 1976, under a pretension of 2.5 N). It relates, furthermore, to a method for the production of one or more fibre strips of this type, a plurality of slivers (1, 2) separate from one another being formed from filaments extending essentially parallel to one another, and the formed slivers being jointly crimped, in order to produce one or more crimped fibre strips. The apparatus for carrying out this method is characterised by a pair of transport rollers (8, 9) for the joint transportation of the slivers (1, 2) supplied and a crimping device (10.1, 10.2, 11, 12) which is arranged downstream of the pair of transport rollers (8, 9), for the crimping of the slivers (1, 2) leaving the pair of transport rollers. In the event of the production of a fibre strip of multiple width having the predetermined tearing line mentioned, the invention allows processing on a double-strand filter-bar machine with an individual treatment part.

Multiple-width fibre strip, especially multiple-width 
filter tow strip (3), consisting of crimped, netted 

filaments, the breaking strength (daN) of the fibre strip 
relative to its total linear density (dtex) being at 

least about 1.7 x 10
-4
 daN/dtex (determined on the lines 
of DIN 53: 834 P1, February 1976, using a pre-tension of 

2.5 N), characterized in that the fibre strip comprises 
a plurality of regions extending in the longitudinal 

direction of the fibre strip and also at least one 
predetermined breaking line (4) extending in the 

longitudinal direction of the fibre strip. 
Fibre strip according to Claim 1, characterized 
in that the breaking strength is at least about 

2.5 x 10
-4
 daN/dtex, especially at least about 
3.5 x 10
-4
 daN/dtex. 
Fibre strip according to Claim 1 or 2, characterized 
in that the regions of the fibre strip which are 

separated by the predetermined breaking line(s) have 
equal or unequal total linear densities. 
Process for producing one or more fibre strips, 
especially as set forth in any of the preceding Claims 1 

to 3, by forming a plurality of mutually separated bands 
(1, 2) from filaments which extend in an essentially 

parallel arrangement, characterized in that the bands 
formed are finally jointly crimped to produce one or more 

crimped fibre strips, especially a filter tow strip (3). 
Process according to Claim 4, characterized in 
that the uncrimped bands (1, 2) are guided in a mutually 

separated state only until shortly before they are 
jointly crimped.  

 
Process according to either of Claims 4 and 5, 
characterized in that u
ncrimped bands are formed in 
different widths for joint crimping. 
Process according to any of Claims 4 to 6, 
characterized in that a plurality of, especially two, 

uncrimped bands (1, 2) are formed in equal widths for 
joint crimping. 
Process according to Claim 5 or 7, characterized 
in that two uncrimped bands (1, 2) are formed in equal 

widths and in that the two uncrimped bands are guided in 
a mutually separated atate until shortly before the joint 

crimping, which produces, after the crimping of the two 
bands, a crimped fibre strip having a centrally extending 

pre-determined breaking line (4). 
Process according to at least one of Claims 4 to 
8, characterized in that the or each predetermined 

breaking line has such a low degree of netting that, upon 
exit from the crimping machine, there are formed a 

plurality of individual fibre strips when the distance 
between the separating wall (6) and the nip region (B) 

between the transport rolls (8, 9) is reduced and/or the 
thickness of the separating wall (6) is increased. 
Process according to any of Claims 4 to 8, 
characterized in that the or each fibre strip produced is 

laid down, pressed and packed to form a bale. 
Process according to Claim 9, characterized in 
that the at least two individual fibre strips are laid 

down in a common laydown box which is partitioned by a 
separating wall and, after removal of the separating 

wall, are jointly pressed and packed to form a unitary 
bale. 
Process according to Claim 9, characterized in 
that the individual fibre strips are laid down in two 

separate laydown boxes, separately pressed and packed to 
form two individual bales. 
Apparatus for carrying out the process of at 
least one of Claims 4 to 12, comprising a crimping means 

(10.1, 10.2, 11, 12) and a separating means (6) for 
separate guidance of the uncrimped bands (1, 2),  

 
characterized in that the apparatus further comprises a 

pair of transport rolls (8, 9) for jointly transporting 
the supplied bands (1, 2) which is situated downstream of 

the separating means and upstream of the crimping means. 
Apparatus according to Claim 13, characterized in 
that the separating means (6) is a separating wall. 
Apparatus according to Claim 14, characterized in 
that the separating wall (6) is adjustable in its 

distance to the nip line (B) of the pair of transport 
rolls (8, 9) and in its thickness.
