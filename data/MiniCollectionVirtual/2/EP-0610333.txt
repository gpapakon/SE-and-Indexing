<ABSTRACT>
Treated apatite particles are disclosed for enhancing medical diagnostic imaging such as magnetic resonance imaging ("MRI"), magnetic resonance spectroscopy ("MRS"), magnetic resonance spectroscopy imaging ("MRSI"), X-ray diagnostic imaging, and ultrasound imaging. Novel coating and manufacturing techniques are disclosed to control particle size and particle aggregation resulting in compositions for organ specific imaging of the liver, spleen, gastrointestinal tract, or tissue disease states. Depending on the diagnostic imaging technique, apatite particles are treated to be paramagnetic, radiopaque, or echogenic. The apatite particles may also be fluorinated to form stable fluoroapatite compositions useful for

F imaging. Also disclosed are diagnostic compositions and methods of performing medical diagnostic procedures which involve administering to a warm-blooded animal a diagnostically effective amount of the above-described apatite particles and then performing the medical diagnostic procedure.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to treated apatite particles
and their use in medical diagnostic imaging techniques,
such as magnetic resonance imaging ("MRI"), magnetic
resonance spectroscopy ("MRS"), magnetic resonance
spectroscopy imaging ("MRSI") and X-ray. The
present invention also includes novel apatite particles,
manufacturing methods, and coating compositions which
prevent particle aggregation, improve particle stability,
and permit functionalization of the particle surface.The use of contrast agents in diagnostic medicine is
rapidly growing. In X-ray diagnostics, for example,
increased contrast of internal organs, such as the kidneys,
the urinary tract, the digestive tract, the vascular system
of the heart (angiography), etc., is obtained by
administering a contrast agent which is substantially
radiopaque. In conventional proton MRI diagnostics,
increased contrast of internal organs and tissues may be
obtained by administering compositions containing
paramagnetic metal species which increase the relaxivity of
surrounding protons. In ultrasound diagnostics, improved
contrast is obtained by administering compositions having
acoustic impedances different than that of blood and other
tissues.Often it is desirable to image a specific organ or
tissue. Effective organ- or tissue-specific contrast
agents accumulate in the organ or tissue of interest.From the foregoing, it would be an important
advancement in the art to provide organ specific medical
diagnostic imaging agents. Specifically, it would be an
improvement in the art to provide organ specific MRI and X-ray
contrast agents.Such medical diagnostic imaging agents are disclosed
and claimed herein. The present invention provides a method of preparing a treated apatite particle and a method for preparing a diagnostic
composition for improved medical diagnostic imaging. The
imaging agents are derived from apatite particles
including, but not limited to, hydroxyapatite (sometimes
referred to as "hydroxylapatite"), fluoroapatite,
iodoapatite, carbonate-apatite, and mixtures and
derivatives thereof. As used herein, the term
fluoroapatite includes pure fluoroapatite as well as
mixtures of fluoroapatite, hydroxyapatite, iodoapatite, and
carbonate-apatite. Likewise, hydroxyapatite, iodoapatite,
and carbonate-apatite are intended to include the pure and
mixed forms. Since hydroxyapatite is a natural bone
constituent, it is well tolerated and generally safe.By controlling the particle size and route of
administration, organ specific imaging of the liver,
spleen,
