<ABSTRACT>
Process for upgrading a hydrocarbonaceous feedstock 
substantially boiling in the gasoline range, which process 

comprises: 

a) subjecting the feedstock to a separation treatment and 
recovering therefrom a first hydrocarbon feed stream 

comprising C₆ and smaller hydrocarbons and a second 
hydrocarbon feed stream comprising C₆ and greater 

hydrocarbons; 
b) subjecting at least part of the second hydrocarbon feed stream 
to a separation treatment wherein normal paraffins and 

optionally mono-isoparaffins are separated from 
di-isoparaffins; 
c) recovering therefrom a first separation effluent stream 
comprising normal paraffins and optionally mono-isoparaffins 

and a second separation effluent stream comprising 
di-isoparaffins; 
d) subjecting at least part of the first separation effluent 
stream to a reforming step to produce a reformate; and 
e) subjecting at least part of the reformate obtained to a 
hydrogenation step.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a process for upgrading a
hydrocarbonaceous feedstock substantially boiling in the gasoline
range, to produce a gasoline blending pool having an enhanced
octane content and a reduced aromatics content.One of the main objects in nowaday's oil refining is to
produce gasolines fulfilling the increasing environmental demands
on product quality and having a high octane number.EP-A-0 553 931 describes one such process already proposed for obtaining an octane-enhanced gasoline.This means for gasoline that the octane specification has now
to be established without lead-containing additives, less
aromatics, in particular benzene, less olefins and lower gasoline
vapour pressure.Object of the present invention is to provide a process for
the preparation of gasolines fulfilling both the increasing
environmental demands on product quality and the high octane
requirement.It has now been found that gasolines can be produced having a
high octane number and a considerably reduced aromatics content,
in particular benzene, when use is made of an upgrading process
comprising a specific sequence of process steps.Accordingly, the present invention relates to a process for
producing a gasoline blending pool having an enhanced octane
content and a reduced aromatics content, which process comprises:
a) subjecting a hydrocarbonaceous feedstock substantially
boiling in the gasoline range to a separation treatment and
recovering therefrom a first hydrocarbon feed stream comprising C6
and smaller hydrocarbons and a second hydrocarbon feed stream
comprising C6 and greater hydrocarbons;b) subjecting at least part of the second hydrocarbon feed
stream to a separation treatment wherein normal paraffins and
optionally mono-isoparaffins are separated from di-isoparaffins;c) recovering therefrom a first separation effluent stream
comprising normal paraffins and optionally mono-isoparaffins and a
second separation effluent stream comprising di-isoparaffins;d) subjecting at least part of the first separation effluent
stream to a reforming step to produce a reformate; e) subjecting at least part of the reformate obtained to a
hydrogenation step; andf) passing the second separation effluent stream from step c) to
a gasoline blending pool.In this way a direct octane enhancement of the resultant
gasoline blending pool is established whilst a substantial
reduction of aromatics content, in particular benzene, is
realized. In refineries with restriction on production of gasoline
due to octane and/or capacity
