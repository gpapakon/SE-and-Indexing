Paper suitable for rotogravure printing, having 
at least on one side a coating provided to receive the 

printing ink and containing mineral pigment and synthetic 
resin binder, characterised in that the coating contains as 

further pigment from 5 to 30% by weight of finely-ground 
cellulose fibres, based on the total pigment portion, and 

from 3.5 to 10% by weight of a synthetic resin binder, 
based on the total pigment content. 
Paper suitable for rotogravure printing according 
to claim 1, characterised in that from 10 to 50% by weight 

of the synthetic resin binder is replaced by starch as 
binder. 
Paper suitable for rotogravure printing according 
to either of claims 1 and 2, characterised in that the 

average fibre length of the cellulose fibres is from 10 to 
30 µm. 
Paper suitable for rotogravure printing according 
to one of claims 1 to 3, characterised in that the average 

diameter of the cellulose fibres is from 10 to 20 µm. 
Paper suitable for rotogravure printing according 
to one of claims 1 to 4, characterised in that the mineral 

pigment consists of calcium carbonate and is present in the 
coating in an amount of from 70 to 85% by weight, based on 

the total pigment content, and from 15 to 30% by weight of 
the total pigment content consists of finely-ground cellulose 

fibres. 
Paper suitable for rotogravure printing according 
to one of Claims 1 to 4, characterised in that the mineral 

pigment consists of kaolin and is present in the coating in 
an amount of from 85 to 95% by weight, based on the total 

pigment content, and from 5 to 15% by weight of the total 

pigment content consists of finely-ground cellulose fibres.  
 
Paper suitable for rotogravure printing according 
to one of Claims 1 to 4, characterised in that the pigment 

content of the coating consists of 85 to 95% by weight of 
calcium carbonate and/or kaolin and talcum and 5 to 15% by 

weight of finely-ground cellulose fibres. 
Paper suitable for rotogravure printing according 
to one of Claims 1 to 4 and 7, characterised in that the 

pigment content of the coating a) consists, to 85 to 95% by 
weight, of a mixture of: 


40 to 70% by weight of calcium carbonate and/or kaolin 
30 to 60% by weight of talcum 
 
and b) consists, to 5 to 15% by weight, of finely-ground 

cellulose fibres. 
Paper suitable for rotogravure printing according 
to one of Claims 1 to 4, characterised in that the mineral 

pigment portion consists of from 10 to 90% by weight of 
calcium carbonate and from 90 to 10% by weight of kaolin, 

and 5 to 15% by weight of finely-ground cellulose fibres, 
based on the total pigment content, is present in the 

coating.
