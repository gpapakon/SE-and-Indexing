<ABSTRACT>
Molded products with improved rigidity and a 
manufacturing method in which hollow moldings formed from 

highly heat-resistant functional resin are filled with 
highly heat-resistant expandable thermoplastic resin 

particles which are then expanded and fused are provided. 
The invention is characterized by a manufacturing 
method for foam-reinforced molded products wherein a 

tubular body for introducing steam is inserted in a hollow 

molding of highly heat-resistant resin, the molding is 
packed with highly heat-resistant expandable thermoplastic 

resin particles and fitted in a jig with an internal 
structure corresponding to the mold cavity, and large 

amounts of steam are introduced through the tubular body, 
thereby expanding and fusing the expandable thermoplastic 

resin particles packed in the molding. The invention is 
also characterized by molded products obtained by this 

manufacturing method in which the expandable thermoplastic 
resin particles are expanded and fused until they contact 

the inner walls of the hollow molding.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention concerns molded products in which hollow moldings consisting of
thermoplastic resin having a heat resistance of at least 100°C have improved rigidity; it also
concerns a manufacturing method for such molded products. What is meant here by
thermoplastic resin having a heat resistance of at least 100°C is a base resin having a Vicat
softening point of at least 100°C.Its field of application consists of comparatively large board- or panel-shaped
molded
resin products requiring high rigidity, for example, large molded products such as
automobile seat-back panels, rear parcel shelves, and side skirts, as well as front panels, side
panels, and modular structural materials for office machines and home electrical/electronic
products, and furniture.The prior art methods for improving the rigidity of hollow moldings include providing a
ribbed structure at the molding stage and injecting urethane foam into the completed
molding.The problems of providing hollow moldings with a ribbed structure include the fact that,
especially in blow molding, there are many restrictions on design, geometry, and the
positions at which ribs can be located, and that, while areas close to ribs are rigid, rigidity
decreases with distance from the ribs.Further drawbacks of rib structures include the fact that it is difficult to obtain a flat
outer surface over the ribs and that the areas around ribs are susceptible to uneven surface
gloss.Injecting urethane foam increases the rigidity of moldings because the foam is injected
into the hollow part of the molding. However, a drawback of urethane resin is that, since it
is thermoplastic, the recycling processes for used products, e.g., recovering, melting,
molding, and the like, are difficult.Expansion molding methods in which a thermoplastic resin with low heat resistance, for
example, particles of polystyrene resin, is expanded inside a blow molding are known in the
prior art, and some such products have actually been used. A thermoplastic resin with a 
low foaming point can be foamed with relative ease in such a method by injecting, for
example, expandable resin particles (beads), into the cavity then blowing in regular
steam.CH-A- 400 552 discloses such a method wherein a tabular body with small
perforations for spraying steam is inserted through an opening formed
in one end of, and into the hollow part of, a hollow molding of
synthetic material, the hollow portion of the said hollow molding is
packed with particles of an expandable thermoplastic resin, the said
