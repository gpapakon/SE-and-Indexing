<ABSTRACT>
Spherical catalysts for use in Ziegler-Natta 
catalyst systems for the low-pressure polymerisation of 

olefins, their preparation and their use. 
It has now been found that a spherical catalyst support prepared by 
the spray-drying of an ammonium dawsonite slurry has excellent 

mechanical and morphological properties which are preserved in the 
catalyst based on the suppo
rt and in the polymer produced using the 
catalyst. The polymer thus obtained exhibits high bulk density and 

excellent flow properties due to its regular spherical morphology.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a spherical
catalyst which may be used in Ziegler-Natta catalyst
systems for the low pressure polymerization of alpha-olefins,
to the preparation of the catalyst and to the
preparation of spherical polyolefins using the catalyst.
In particular, the invention relates to ultra-high
molecular weight polyethylene and to its preparation in the
presence of such catalyst. The invention also relates to a
spherical catalyst support from which the catalyst is
prepared and to its preparation. The catalyst prepared
from the support and the polyolefin prepared using the
catalyst exhibit the spherical shape of the support. This
leads to improved flow and morphological properties of the
polyolefin prepared.In Ziegler-Natta type polymerisation reactions,
there is a demand for catalysts which provide improved
processing and which yield polymers having increased bulk
density and requiring the use of lower amounts of
antioxidant to make the polymer storage stable. These
aspects are believed to be linked to the morphology of the
product polymer and this area has been the focus of
numerous studies.It is known to use supported catalysts to
control the morphology of the polymer and it has been
observed that there is a direct relationship between the 
morphology of the catalyst support and that of the polymer.
This is the so-called replication phenomenon. For example,
according to FR 1,550,186, if the support is microspherical
in shape the polymer which is obtained is in the shape of
small spheres.FR 2,071,111 describes the preparation of a
supported catalyst for use in Ziegler-Natta catalyst
systems. The catalyst is prepared by reducing on an inert
support a Group IV, V or VI metal halide, the metal being
in its maximum valence state with, for example, an
organoaluminium compound, both reactants being in liquid
form. The support is in the form of "cenospheres" which
are round bodies having diameters between 50 and 250
microns, composed of agglomerated particles having
diameters between 0.2 and 2 microns. The external shape of
the cenospheres determines the morphology of the final
product obtained with the supported catalyst. However, the
use of this type of support has the drawback that its
preparation in industry is not particularly practical.According to A. Munoz-Escalona, Polymer
Preprints of the American Chemical Society, Division of
Polymer Chemistry, 24(1), pages 112-13 (1983), the catalyst
support controls the morphology of the polymer using
supported Ziegler-Natta catalysts
