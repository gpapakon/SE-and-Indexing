<ABSTRACT>
An individual absorbent article package, such as a sanitary napkin wrapper and an adhesive fastening system for such a wrapper are disclosed. The adhesive fastening system comprises a tape tab having an adhesive for releasably securing the wrapper and sanitary napkin in a folded configuration prior to and after use. The adhesive is adhered to a landing surface such as a portion of the sanitary napkin wrapper that forms part of the package body. The landing surface need not be reinforced to prevent tearing upon opening of the package. The fastening system provides bond security while at the same time making the fastening system easy to open without tearing by carefully matching of the properties of the adhesive, the tape tab, and the landing surface. The surface characteristics, elasticity modulus, and caliper of the landing surface are specified. The agressiveness (quick-stick) and coating weights of the adhesive are carefully selected to provide an adhesive fastening system that bonds easily, holds securely and is refastenable.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to adhesive fastening systems
for packages for individually packaged disposable absorbent
articles like sanitary napkins and adult incontinent products,
and, more particularly, to a refastenable adhesive fastening
system that bonds easily, holds securely, and is easily opened
and refastened without tearing the package even if the package
consists of a low caliper polyethylene film having no
reinforcement for strength against tearing.Sanitary napkins used to collect vaginal discharges and
adult incontinent products are well known in the art.
Various arrangements for individually packaging such absorbent
articles are also known in the art.Individually packaged sanitary napkins are disclosed in U.S.
Patent 3,973,567 issued to Srinivasan, et al. on August 10, 1976;
U.S. Patent 4,917,675 issued to Taylor, et al. on April 17, 1990, 
European Patent Application Publication No. 0357000 A1 published
in the name of Umesh on March 7, 1990, and in U.S. Patent
4,556,146 issued December 3, 1985, to Swanson et al. The
Swanson, et al. patent discloses a trifolded wrapper which
packages a sanitary napkin, covers adhesive on the outwardly
oriented face of the backsheet, and may be used for disposing of
the used sanitary napkin.Other trifolded arrangements are known, such as that
disclosed in U.S. Patent 3,604,423 issued September 14, 1971 to
Fraser and in International Publication WO 89/02728 published
April 6, 1989 in the name of Froidh et al. Discarding used
sanitary napkins enveloped in the packaging is also taught in the
art. For example, International Publication WO 89/02729
published April 6, 1989 in the name of Pigneul and U.S. Patent
4,608,047 issued August 26, 1986 to Mattingly disclose two
packaging arrangements intended for this purpose.The search for improved individual packages for disposable
absorbent articles such as sanitary napkins has, however,
continued. In particular, the search for a refastenable
fastening system for such packages which satisfies all the
desired criteria for such packages, has continued.For instance, the design of adhesive fastening systems for
individual disposable absorbent article packages concentrates on
two major criteria which are generally opposed to each other:
adhesive bond security and refastenability. It is the goal of
such adhesive fastening systems to achieve both strong adhesive
bond security (a bond which remains adhered to the package until
it is desired to open the package to remove the absorbent
article), and non-destructive removal of
