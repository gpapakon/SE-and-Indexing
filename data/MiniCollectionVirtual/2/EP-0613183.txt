<ABSTRACT>
A position measuring element (4) is fabricated by forming a film (5) facing to the direction (X), a photoconductive film (6), 
and a resistor film (7) in the direction (Y) on one side of a transparent glass plate (2). A light shielding film (3) is formed on the 

other side of the glass plate (2). A pin hole (31) is made in the center of the film to pass light through it. In such a way, the position 
measuring element (4) and the light shielding film (3) are integrally formed on the glass plate (2). Then, both the position 

measuring element (4) and the light shielding film (3) are mounted on the case of a sensor when the glass plate (2) is attached to 
the sensor case. Hence the assembling work of the position measuring element (4) and the light shielding film (3) together with 

the housing is facilitated.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a photosensor for 
detecting at least either of the azimuth, altitude and intensity 
of incident light, and a method of manufacturing the same. Solar radiation sensors for detecting the direction of 
incident light in a compartment of an automobile are disclosed 
in, for example, Japanese Patent Publication Laid-Open No. sho 
62-71713. Such a solar radiation sensor includes a light 
screening member (an instrument panel 20) having a slit through 
which solar radiation passes, and photoelectric converting 
elements (each having a variable resistor element 23, a 
photoconductive element 24 and a common terminal plate 25) 
provided below the light screening member at fixed intervals. 
The solar radiation sensor is adapted to output a signal 
representing the position of the light illuminated onto the 
photoelectric converting elements through the slit. A 
microcomputer detects the direction of an incident light on the 
basis of the produced signal. In the above-described conventional solar radiation 
sensor, the light screening member is constituted by the 
instrument panel. However, the light screening member is 
generally formed of a thin plate having a transmission hole, such  
 
as a pin hole or a slit. In that case, when the light screening 
member (hereinafter referred to as a light screening film) 
constituted by the thin plate and the photoelectric converting 
elements are mounted on a casing of the solar radiation sensor, 
the light screening film and the photoelectric converting 
elements must be mounted separately, deteriorating the mounting 
property. This problem occurs not only with solar radiation 
sensors but also with throttle position sensors which include the 
light screening film having a transmission hole, such as a pin 
hole or a slit, and the photoelectric converting elements, as in 
the above-described solar radiation sensor. In other words, the 
problem involving deterioration in the mounting property with 
which the light screening film and the photoelectric converting 
elements are mounted is common to all the photosensors which 
include the light screening film having a transmission hole, such 
as a pin hole or a slit, and the photoelectric converting 
elements.  
 From JP-A-57 173 256 an image sensor comprising the features 
recited in the preamble of claim 1 is known. Moreover, JP-A-63 278 284 discloses a two-dimensional light-position 
detection device which can obtain a big output 
voltage in proportion to the position of the incident light
