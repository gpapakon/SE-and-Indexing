<ABSTRACT>
A package for use im microwave ovens is disclosed in its preferred form of a flexible, tubular bag (18) including expandable side walls (26) interconnected between bottom and top walls (20, 22), an openable end (28), and a permanent end wall (24). The side walls (26) include pleats (26a, 26b, 26c, 26d) which are folded in a collapsed condition of the bag (18) and expand due to internal expansion forces generated by the popping of kernels and the creation of water vapor. In a preferred form, the bag (18) is formed from a single layer of flexible, greaseproof paper of highly refined raw fibers of 100% chemical softwood pulp and having a basis weight in the order of 35 1b/ream. The single layer of paper forming the bag (18) provides greaseproof properties in storage, transportation, and cooking throughout the thickness of the paper to prevent wicking and leaking of grease or oil through the single layer. The bag (18) in a preferred form includes grease protectors (42a, 42b, 42c, 42d) located inside of the bag (18) for sealing the bottom and top walls (20, 22) to the pleats (26a, 26b, 26c, 26d) adjacent to their respective connecting edges and in a most preferred form further includes grease protectors (44a, 44b) outside of the bag (18) for sealing the first and second pleats (26a, 26b) together and the third and fourth pleats (26c, 26d) together adjacent to their respective connecting edges. The grease protectors (42a, 42b, 42c, 42d, 44a, 44b) seal the surfaces of the bag (18) just above and adjacent the connecting edges to block the flow of grease to prevent grease wicking or leaking from the bag (18).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates generally to packages
for use in microwave ovens, and pertains more
particularly to an expandable bag having protection from
grease leaking and/or wicking from its expansion creases
or folds and/or to a flexible popcorn package made from a
single layer of greaseproof paper.When microwave popcorn packages were first introduced
utilizing a microwave susceptor, the packages typically
were formed by expandable paperboard containers and often
the load of the microwave popcorn popping package was
located in a plastic bag positioned inside of the 
paperboard container including the microwave susceptor.
The paperboard container in most instances was unfolded
into an expanded size by the consumer prior to popping of
the popcorn kernels in the microwave oven but in some
instances was unfolded by the popping of the popcorn
kernels, with the popped popcorn being served in the
expanded paperboard containers. Early packages suffered
from several disadvantages including the bulk of
expandable paperboard containers which increased the
amount of material required to make the container and
thus its cost, increased the size of the packaging and
storage requirements, as well as increased the amount of
material which had to be disposed of after the
consumption of the popcorn raising environmental
concerns. Further, the dynamics of expanding the
paperboard container and/or plastic bag by the forces
generated while popping the kernels were typically
insufficient to maximize the volume of the package which
in turn prevented the popcorn from popping with greater
volume. Also, plastic bags are susceptible to melting
and often are difficult to handle with a hot food product
at least due to the poor insulating qualities of plastic.
To avoid these and other problems and with the development
of microwave susceptors applied in the form of a thin
coating such as disclosed in U.S. Patent No. 4,267,420
issued to William A. Brastad, the microwave popcorn
industry has turned to popcorn packages formed from
flexible paper bags.However, paper microwave popcorn popping bags
including microwave susceptors encountered different
types of problems. For example, the load of a microwave
popcorn popping package includes unpopped popcorn
kernels, a cooking oil or grease, salt, and other
ingredients such as colorings, flavorings, or the like.
It can be appreciated that during storage or
transportation of the filled microwave popcorn package by 
the processor, the marketing agencies, and the consumer,
the oil and/or

by the consumer after microwave cooking; and susceptor
means (30) for converting microwave energy into heat

extending over a portion of the bag (18), with the
popcorn kernels and the grease or oil generally

overlying the susceptor means (30) during microwave
cooking; characterized in that the bag (18) is formed of

a single layer of greaseproof paper having a thickness
allowing the single layer to be flexed by the popping of

the popcorn kernels and also preventing the wicking and
leaking of the grease or oil through the single layer.
The popcorn package of claim 1 wherein the
greaseproof paper is formed of raw fibers which are

highly refined.
The popcorn package of claim 2 wherein the raw
fibers are selected from the group of 100% chemical

softwood pulps.
