<ABSTRACT>
In a process for the production of gaseous nitrogen by cold distillation, the cold requirements of the plant are met by expansion of a portion of the gas to be distilled. The expanded gas is then mixed with a residual gas produced by the plant and sent to the main exchanger (2).

Process for producing gaseous nitrogen from a mixture to 
be treated in a distillation column (4), the said mixture 

comprising more particularly nitrogen and oxygen, the said 
process consisting of : 


a) compressing the mixture to be treated to a pressure at 
least equal to the operating pressure of the said column, of 

the order of 3 to 5 bar; 
b) cooling the compressed mixture in an exchanger (2) and 
expanding a first fraction of the said cooled mixture in a 

turbine (3) to produce the cooling necessary for the process 
and then distilling the mixture in the column to obtain, in 

the upper part of the column, a fraction enriched in nitrogen 
which is then reheated; 
c) withdrawing part of the fraction enriched in reheated 
nitrogen as a product; 
d) compressing a remaining part of the fraction enriched in 
reheated nitrogen and then cooling it; 
e) recycling part of the said remaining part of the fraction 
enriched in nitrogen in the exchanger-vaporizer (6) situated 

at the bottom of the said column, in which this part condenses 
in the form of a liquid rich in nitrogen and provides the heat 

necessary for vaporization in the column; 
f) introducing part of the liquid rich in nitrogen condensed 
in stage e) above in the upper part of the column as 

additional reflux liquid; 
g) extracting a fraction enriched in oxygen in liquid form, 
from the lower part of the column and expanding at least part 

of the said fraction to a pressure less than the column  
 

pressure and vaporizing this part by heat transfer with the 
fraction enriched in nitrogen which condenses in the upper 

part of the column; and characterized in that it comprises the 
stage of : 
h) extracting from the top of the column (4) the said 
vaporized part from stage g) as a residual gas and reuniting 

it with the mixture expanded in the turbine (3) and conveying 
it to the exchanger (2) and in that only a non-expanded second 

fraction of the mixture is distilled in the column. 
Process according to claim 1, characterized in that the 
nitrogen withdrawn as a product is in gaseous and/or liquid 

form. 
Process according to one of claims 1 and 2, consisting of 
recompressing a first fraction of the said compressed mixture 

in a compressor (50) driven by the turbine (3), and cooling 
the said recompressed first fraction and expanding it in the 

said turbine (3). 
Process according to one of claims 1 to 3, wherein the 
first fraction of the mixture is expanded in the turbine (3) 

to a pressure close to atmospheric pressure. 
Process according to one of claims 1 to 4, wherein a 
condensed part (20a) of the fraction enriched in nitrogen from 

stage e) is diverted to a buffer vessel (20c) when the 
production of gaseous nitrogen is reduced. 
Process according to claim 5, wherein part of the fraction 
enriched in oxygen from stage g) is diverted to a buffer 

vessel (7c) when the production of gaseous nitrogen is at a 
maximum.
