<DESCRIPTION>
It is known that, in general, in the electrolysis
of aqueous solutions of chlorides, at the anode
chlorine is developed, and the cathodic reaction can
either be the development of hydrogen with production
of alkalinity, or the precipitation of the metal,
according to the position the latter occupies in the
series of the electrochemical potentials, according to
the following reactions:anodic reaction:
Cl- - e → ½ Cl2cathodic reaction:
Me+ + e + H2O → MeOH + ½ H2
or
Me+ + e → MeAt acidic pH values, chlorine gas is developed.Under neutral or alkaline pH conditions,
chlorine, owing to the increase in its water
solubility, causes, by dismutation, the formation of
hypochlorite and other oxygen-containing compounds,
such as chlorate and perchlorate.In the case of alkali-metal chlorides at pH<4,
chlorine is produced, and at higher pH value alkali-metal
hypochlorites or, in the case of higher anodic
potentials, alkali-metal chlorates and perchlorates
are produced.Large amounts of chemical products are
manufactured by this route.In the case of heavy metal chlorides (Cu, Co, Ni,
Zn, Cd, Pb etc.), at a relatively acidic pH the metal 
is deposited at the cathode and chlorine is developed
at the anode.The anodic compartment of the cell must be kept
separated from the cathodic compartment by means of a
diaphragm or a membrane, and said anodic comportament
should be closed in order to make it possible for pure
chlorine to be collected, first of all in order to
prevent a so toxicant gas from getting dispersed in
the environment, and, furthermore, in order to prevent
chlorine from coming, by diffusion, into contact with
the deposited metal, dissolving it.The split cell, the use of which is mandatory for
these kind of processes, adds a considerable
complication to the electrolysis facility and, in the
event when an ionic membrane is used in order to
separate the compartments, it also implies a very high
equipment cost.The production of chlorine, parallel to metal
production, constitutes another limitation to the
application of the electrolysis of chlorides for
producing metals, because it is necessary that the
same process can make use of the chlorine it produces.This is the case, for example, in the Falconbridge
process, which produces electrolytic nickel from
aqueous solutions of chlorides and uses chlorine in
order to oxidize the ore.In general, according to the prior art, the
electrolysis of the aqueous solutions of heavy metal
chlorides did not enjoy those important industrial
applications which its potentialities
