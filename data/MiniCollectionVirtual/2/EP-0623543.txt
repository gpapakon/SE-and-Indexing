<ABSTRACT>
This folding device includes two upstream paper-supply rollers (5), two downstream paper-exit rollers (18, 18') for movement control, a paper guide (8) arranged so as to pivot between the upstream rollers (5) and the downstream rollers, capable of taking up a first and a second position and including a presser roller (14, 14'), the whole assembly being controlled so as to permit the formation of loops and folds in the paper.

Folding machine of the type comprising two input rollers (5) for 
feeding the paper, driven by first movement control means (6), two output 

rollers (18, 18') for discharging the paper controlled by second movement 
control means (20), a paper guide (8) pivotally mounted between the input 

rollers (5) and the output rollers (18, 18'), capable of assuming a first and a 
second position (24, resp. 25), the guide (8) in its first position (24) directing 

the paper from the input rollers (5) to the output rollers (18, 18'), and, in its 
second position (25), directing the paper from the input rollers (5) to a 

region spaced from the output rollers (18, 18'), a press roller (14, 14') 
capable of being applied against one of the two output rollers (18, 18'), and 

an electronic control unit for synchronizing and controlling the pivoting of 
the guide (8) and the movement of the input and output rollers,
 
   characterized in that
 
the pivotal paper guide (8) comprises, connected to move therewith, said 

press roller (14, 14') capable, when the guide is in the first position (24), of 
coming to be applied against one (18') of the two output rollers (18, 18'), 

and the first and second control means and the control unit are coordinated to 
carry out the following steps : 


c) passage of the guide (8) to the second position (25) 
d) forward driving of the input rollers (5) for advancing the paper 
through the guide (8) by a first predetermined length 
e) passage of the guide (8) to the first position 
f) forward driving of the input rollers (5) for advancing the paper 
through the guide (8) by a second predetermined length and 

forming an initial portion of a loop (27) directed toward the 

output rollers (18, 18') 
g) forward driving of the output rollers (18, 18') for seizing the 
initial portion of the loop (27) and driving the remainder of the 

paper. 
Folding machine according to claim 1, characterized in that the 
first and second control means and the control unit are coordinated for 

carrying out, before the steps c) to g), the following steps : 

a) passage of the guide (8) to the first position (24) 
b) forward driving of the input rollers (5) for advancing the paper 
through the guide by a third predetermined length sufficient to 

ensure that the front edge of the paper is seized in the output 
rollers 
 
the subsequent forward driving of the input rollers (5) having for effect to 

form an initial portion of a loop (26) moving away from the input rollers (5) 
and output rollers (18, 18'). 
Folding machine according to either one of the claims 1 and 2, 
characterized in that the guide (8) comprises a paper detecting cell (17).
