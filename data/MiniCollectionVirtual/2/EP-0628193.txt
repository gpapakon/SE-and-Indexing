<DESCRIPTION>
A Holder for -Remote Control DevicesHie present invention relates to a holder for a remote control device of the kind used to control television apparatus, video tape recorders, and luce apparatus.A c- rπmonly occuring problem is that different remote control devices are required for controlling different apparatus, such as a television set and a video tape recorder.A consumer will generally purchase a television set and a video tape recorder as separate units and be given one remote control device for the television set and another remote control device for the video tape record er. When both of these apparatus are to be used siimiltaneously, it is necessary to fetch or find both remote control devices. The place in which one or the other of these remote control devices is to be found will depen among other things, on how and where the device was last used.Ihe present invention solves this problem.The present invention thus relates to a holder for remote control devices which are intended to control television apparatus, video tape recorders, and luce apparatus, and is characterized in that the holder includes a first plate and a second plate which is attached to the first plate and projects at right angles therefrom; in that the first plate is provided with two generally rectangular openings and the second plate is attached in a part of said first plate located between the openings; in that the openings are of mutually different size; and in t at said part is offset from the centre of the first plate.The invention will now be described in more detail with reference to an exeπplifying embodiment thereof and also with reference to the accαπpanyin drawing, in which- Figure 1 is a side view of an inventive holder which is shown to suppor two remote control devices;- Figure 2 illustrates a first part of the holder as seen from the right in Figure 1; and- Figure 3 illustrates a second part of the holder as seen from above. 

Figure 1 illustrates an inventive holder 1 which is intended to support remote control devices intended for controlling television apparatus, video tape recorders, and like apparatus.The inventive holder 1 includes a first plate 2 and a second plate 3 which is attached to the first plate. The second plate 3 projects at right angles from the first plate 2. As will be seen from Figure 2, the first plate 2 is provided with two generally rectangular openings or cavities 4, 5. The second plate 3 is attached to a part 6 of the first plate located between the openings 4, 5.It will be seen from
