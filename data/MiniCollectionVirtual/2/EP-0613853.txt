<ABSTRACT>
A maintenance elevator 40 is employed in the case of an 
emergency situation such as a failure of the carriage 16 or in 

carrying out regular maintenance and checkup operations. An 
operator can get on the maintenance elevator 40 brought to a 

stop at its lowermost position. The maintenance elevator 40 is 
moved upward along a post 12 and is brought to a stop at any 

position in which, for example, a gangway 57 formed integrally 

with the elevator 40 is opposed to the carriage 16. Movement of 
the operator between the maintenance elevator 40 and the 

carriage 16 can be done by utilizing the gangway 57. 
Transfer from the maintenance elevator to the carriage and 
vice versa can be always made in an easy and safe manner by 

using the gangway. Provision of all the gangways at the 
maintenance elevator side realizes weight reduction at the 

carriage side, good energy saving, and cost reduction.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a handling apparatus for
use in handling articles in, for example, an automatic housing
facility and, more particularly, to a maintenance-elevator-equipped
handling apparatus including a warehousing carriage and
a maintenance elevator adapted for use in maintenance and check
operations.Hitherto, a crane of this sort has been known as disclosed
in Japanese Patent Application Laid-Open No. 1- 313202 in which
is proposed a travelling crane equipped with an elevator cab.
In this prior art arrangement, the travelling crane includes a
travelling body comprising a lower frame guided by a lower guide
rail, an upper frame guided by an upper guide rail, and a pair
of posts, front and rear, integrally connecting the two frames,
and a carriage upward and downward movable between the two
posts, with load transfer means mounted on the carriage.A pair of guide rails, right and left, are mounted through a
bracket to one of the posts on the outer side thereof as viewed
from the direction of travel of the travelling body. An
elevator cab is upward and downward movably carried on the guide
rails and is equipped with brake means operable to act on 
the guide rails. Within the lower frame at a level below the
posts there are provided a motor and a reduction gear for
driving the elevator cab to move upward and downward, with a
vertical run drive chain trained between a toothed drive wheel
mounted to an output shaft of the motor or reduction gear and a
toothed driven wheel disposed in the upper frame, the vertical
run drive chain being connected to the elevator cab.According to such prior art arrangement, the travelling
crane can, when manually operated by an operator getting on a
carriage-side cab or remotely operated from the ground side,
perform load delivery to or load withdrawal from a target site
of the rack through a combination of horizontal run of the
travel body, vertical run of the carriage, and forking movement
of load transfer means.The elevator cab is used when emergency repairs are required
due to, for example, a failure of the carriage or a load
collapse occurring during the operation of the crane, as well as
for regular maintenance and checkup purposes. In such a case,
an operator gets on the elevator cab and manipulates a control
panel provided in the cab to drive the motor to rotate the
vertical drive chain forward and reverse, whereby the elevator
cab will be moved upward and downward along the guide rail.
When the elevator cab is brought to a stop at a position
opposite to
