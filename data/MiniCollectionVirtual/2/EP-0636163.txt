<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to thermal and
ultraviolet (UV) radiation curable silarylene-siloxane
random copolymers and cured compositions thereof, and
to a process for making the copolymer. The cured
silarylene-siloxane copolymers are elevated temperature
resistant pressure-sensitive adhesives (PSAs).Silicone pressure-sensitive adhesives are well
known. Generally, they comprise a mixture of a
silicone polymer, a tackifier resin, solvents,
viscosity stabilizers, and other additives and are
cured by thermal and/or catalytic means. Silicone
polymers used in these mixtures are gums containing
dimethylsiloxy and diphenylsiloxy groups and siloxy
groups having a group useful in a crosslinking reaction
such as a vinyl or acrylic group. Such adhesives,
although useful for many applications, fail for
applications necessitating elevated temperatures.Silicone polymers containing organic groups in
addition to oxygen atoms between silicone atoms are
well known. These polymers in which the organic group
is an arylene group are known as silarylene polymers
and those polymers also containing diorganosiloxy
groups are known as silarylene-siloxane copolymers.
These copolymers can generally be cured by exposure to
ionizing radiation or by heating in the presence of
well known catalysts. Silarylene-siloxane and siloxane
units in the copolymer may have a random distribution
as is disclosed in U.S. Patent Nos. 2,562,000,
3,287,310, 3,332,973, and 4,340,711 or the units may be
blocks as is disclosed in U.S. Patent No. 3,959,403.
U.S. Patent No. 3,444,127 discloses ordered 
poly(arylenesiloxane) polymers, and U.S. Patent No.
4,366,323 discloses arylene-siloxanylene polymers.The silarylene-siloxane copolymers described above
can be useful, for example, in high temperature
resistant fluids, fibers, coatings, or elastomers.U.S. Patent No. 4,534,838 discloses photoinitiating
silicones and makes reference to others.U.S. Patent No. 4,563,514 discloses radiation
curable polysilarylene-polysiloxane copolymers which
can be crosslinked in the presence of a suitable cure
initiator to provide transparent, self-bonding, dirt
repellent, tough, and solvent resistant compositions.Vinyl substituted silarylene-siloxane copolymers
are disclosed in Macromolecules, Vol. 24, No. 16, pages
4503-4509, and 4510 to 4514 (1991). Silarylene-siloxane
compositions curable to pressure-sensitive
adhesives are not disclosed.None of the above art or any other art of which
the inventor is aware provides a silarylene-siloxane
copolymer composition that is
