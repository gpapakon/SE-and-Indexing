<ABSTRACT>
An air/fuel control system which includes feedback
control from an exhaust gas oxygen sensor (44) positioned

upstream of a catalytic converter (50). The exact air/fuel
ratio required optimum converter efficiency is determined by

generating an emissions signal from both a HC/CO sensor (54)
and a NO sensor (46) each positioned downstream of the

catalytic converter (50). The feedback variable (FV) is
trimmed by a signal derived from the emissions signal to

maintain air/fuel operation at a value corresponding to
maximum converter efficiency.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to air/fuel control systems for
internal combustion engines equipped with catalytic
converters.Feedback control systems are known for trimming liquid
fuel delivered to an internal combustion engine in response
to an exhaust gas oxygen sensor positioned upstream of a
three-way catalytic converter. Typically, the exhaust gas
oxygen sensor provides a two-state, high/low (rich/lean)
output dependent upon the existence of a low or high oxygen
partial pressure in the engine exhaust under local
thermodynamic equilibrium on the sensor electrodes. Because
the exhaust gas may not be in thermodynamic equilibrium, the
high-to-low switch point of the sensor may not occur at the
stoichiometric air/fuel ratio. In particular, the switch
point may not coincide exactly with the peak of the window
of the three-way catalytic converter. It is also known to
use a second EGO sensor downstream of the catalytic
converter for the purpose of reducing the mismatch between
the sensor switch point and the peak window of the catalytic
converter by biasing the mean air/fuel value.The inventors herein have recognized, however, that
even though an exhaust gas oxygen sensor positioned
downstream of a catalytic converter provides a better
indication of the catalytic converter operating window than
an upstream sensor, it may not always provide the desired
indication. Even when a relatively good correspondence is
initially achieved, aging and temperature affects of the
downstream oxygen sensor may cause a variance between the
sensor indication and the air/fuel ratio required for
maximum efficiency of the catalytic converter. The
inventors herein have also found that even when the post
catalytic oxygen sensor accurately switches at
stoichiometry, the switch point may not be accurately
aligned with the most efficient converter efficiency for a
particular converter. EP-A-310 120 describes an electronic air/fuel
ratio control apparatus in an engine having a ternary
catalyst in the exhaust system. The control system
includes, upstream of the ternary catalyst, an exhaust gas
oxygen sensor incorporating a nitrogen oxide reducing
catalyst layer. The air/fuel ratio is controlled to a first
value in dependence upon the detection of oxygen
concentration including the oxygen in the nitrogen oxides.
The air/fuel ratio is re-set to a richer value if a high
concentration of nitrogen oxides is detected or to a leaner
value when a high concentration of incompletely burnt
components is detected.JP-A-02 125 941 describes an air/fuel
