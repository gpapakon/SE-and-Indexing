<ABSTRACT>
Actuator units (30) independently dedicated to nozzles (3) 
divided into a plurality of groups are fixed to a common flow 

path unit (40) having the nozzles formed therein with through 
holes aligned with one another. Heads of various types can be 

formed by using the actuator units (30) of the same design 
only by changing the mode of arrangement of the nozzles (3) 

in accordance with the purpose.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a laminated ink jet recording
head.On-demand ink jet recording heads that are designed to
output characters and graphics by jetting ink droplets from a
plurality of nozzles in accordance with input information are
rapidly gaining in popularity because of their high print
quality and low noise compared with wire-dot type recording
heads and because of their low running cost compared with page
printers.Among these ink jet recording heads, a so-called face-ejected
ink jet head, which is designed to jet ink droplets in
a direction perpendicular to the surface of a plate by
arranging a plurality of nozzles on the plate, has features
that a high degree of freedom is given to nozzle arrangement
and that the head can be manufactured relatively simply because
of a laminated structure.Fig. 13 shows an exemplary ink jet recording head
having the aforementioned laminated structure. A channel plate
94 defining slender pressure producing chambers 96 on a flat 
surface has one surface thereof sealed by a vibration plate 95
having piezoelectric vibration elements 97 formed so as to
correspond to pressure producing chambers 96, and the other
surface thereof sealed by a regulating plate 93 having
regulating orifices 98.A manifold plate 92 laminated on the surface of the
regulating plate 93 has through holes that define reservoir
chambers 99 for supplying ink to the respective pressure
producing chambers 96 via the regulating orifices 98. Flow
paths 100, 101, 102 which supply the ink from an ink tank and
which runs through the vibration plate 95, the channel plate
94, and the regulating plate 93 are formed for the reservoir
chambers 99.Further, nozzles 90 are formed in a nozzle plate
103 that is fixed to a side opposite to the vibration plate 95.
Communicating holes 104, 105, 106 for connecting the nozzles 90
... to the respective pressure producing chambers are formed so
as to extend through the regulating plate 93 and the manifold
plate 92.This laminated ink jet recording head is characterized
in that the respective pressure producing chambers are
typically arranged in two arrays so as to confront each other
at an interval of from 1.01 to 1.53 mm (0.04 to 0.06 inches)
within an array and are alternately connected to the nozzles
pitched at an interval of from 0.50 to 0.77 mm (0.02 to 0.03
inches) within the single array. By the way, to improve the recording quality of such
ink jet recording head, it is necessary to increase the density
of pixels to be recorded by downsizing an ink droplet to be
je
