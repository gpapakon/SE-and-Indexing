compound,

[A] denotes a segment formed by 1,4-addition of butadiene

optionally substituted with a C
1
-C
6
 alkyl group,

[A'] denotes a segment formed by vinyl addition of

butadiene optionally substituted by a C
1
-C
6
 alkyl group,
and n + m denotes an integer from 7 to 3000,

are copolymerised by radical polymerisation with
(meth)acrylic ester monomers of formula II



wherein

R' denotes hydrogen or methyl and
R
2
 denotes an alkyl group with 1 to 26 carbon atoms.

(inert) heterocyclic 5- or 6-membered ring or a group



where Z denotes oxygen or an -NR
4
 group and Q denotes an
optionally alkylated hydrocarbon bridge with a total of 2

to 50 carbon atoms, which may be interrupted by oxygen
bridges, preferably 2 to 6 C-bridge members, and R

nitrogen and optionally other heteroatoms, a heterocyclic
5- or 6-membered ring and wherein R
4
 denotes hydrogen or
an alkyl group having 1 to 6 carbon atoms,

are copolymerised in amounts of from 0.5 to 25 wt.% based
on the total quantity of monomers.
