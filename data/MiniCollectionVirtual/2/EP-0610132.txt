<ABSTRACT>
The arrangement is applied in the case where the document (1) carries, apart from the write track (4), a pre-encoded synchronisation track (5) allowing synchronisation of the write signals. The arrangement therefore includes a magnetic write head (E) equipped with a write winding, a magnetic read head (Lh) which reads the said pre-encoded track and is equipped with a read winding, and is characterised in that it furthermore includes an auxiliary magnetic head (Ta) equipped with an electrical winding, this head being arranged symmetrically with the write head (E) with respect to the axis (5) of the pre-encoded synchronisation track, the windings of the write head (E) and auxiliary head (Ta) receiving the same current and the respective direction of flow of this current in these two heads being determined so as to produce in the region of the gap (13) in the synchronisation head (Lh) a field of equal strength but oppositely directed.
