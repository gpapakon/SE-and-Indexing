<DESCRIPTION>
This application is a continuation-in-part of U.S. 
Serial No. 078,519, filed July 27, 1987, U.S. Serial 
No. 933,107, filed November 20, 1986, U.S. Serial No. 
902,877, filed September 2, 1986, U.S. Serial No. 
887,140, filed July 17, 1986, U.S. Serial No. 823,102, 
filed January 27, 1986, and U.S. Serial No. 773,403, 
filed September 6, 1985, the contents of each of which 
are hereby incorporated by reference into the present 
application. Within this application several Publications are referenced 
by Arabic numerals within parentheses. Full 
citations for these references may be found at the end 
of the specification immediately preceding the claims. 
The disclosures of these publications in their entirety 
are hereby incorporated by reference into this application 
in order to more fully describe the state of the 
art to which this invention pertains. The advent of recombinant DNA techniques has made it 
possible to manipulate the naturally occurring DNA 
sequences within an organism (the genome) in order to 
change in some manner the functions of the organism 
through genetic engineering. The present invention 
concerns organisms defined as viruses that infect animals 
and contain DNA as their genetic material; specifically 
viruses belonging to the herpesvirus group (herpesviruses)  
 
(23). This group of viruses comprise a 
number of pathogenic agents that infect and cause disease 
in a number of target species: swine, cattle, 
chickens, horses, dogs, cats, etc. Each herpesvirus is 
specific for its host species, but they are all related 
in the structure of their genomes, their mode of 
replication, and to some extent in the pathology they 
cause in the host animal and in the mechanism of the 
host immune response to the virus infection. The types of genetic engineering that have been performed 
on these herpesviruses consist of cloning parts 
of the virus DNA into plasmids in bacteria, reconstructing 
the virus DNA while in the cloned state so 
that the DNA contains deletions of certain sequences, 
and furthermore adding foreign DNA sequences either in 
place of the deletions or at sites removed from the 
deletions. The usual method is to make insertions of 
the foreign DNA into the viral sequences, although the 
foreign DNA could be attached to the end of the viral 
DNA as well. One utility of the addition of foreign 
sequences is achieved when the foreign sequence encodes 
a foreign protein that is expressed during viral infection 
of the animal. A virus with these characteristics 
is
