<ABSTRACT>
An antiviral contraceptive device is obtained by blocking adsorption sites for the antiinfective agent which may exist in the lubricating agent, e.g., crosslinked corn starch, or in the material of the glove itself. The contraceptive device of the invention comprises an elastomeric hand-shaped body having interior and exterior surfaces and an inner coating disposed on the interior surface of the elastomeric body. The inner coating comprises (a) an antiinfective agent selected from the group consisting of chlorhexidine and pharmaceutically acceptable salts of chlorhexidine and (b) a lubricating agent which does not significantly adsorb the antiinfective agent. The inner coating is effective to deliver an antivirally effective amount of the antiinfective agent within ten minutes of exposure to a liquid.

<DESCRIPTION>
This application relates to antiinfective
condoms
having a quick release coating containing a
biguanide antiinfective agent. The condoms of the
invention provide rapid protection against infectious
agents, including viruses, and are stable over
prolonged storage periods.Condoms provide a barrier function
to prevent passage of sperm. At the same time, a
barrier to the passage of infectious microorganisms may
be provided in a manner similar to the way in which
surgical and examination gloves provide a barrier
function providing separation between a patient and a
health care worker. In fulfilling this function, the
condoms act to block the introduction of infectious
agents, particularly viruses, bacteria and fungi from
the body fluids of one individual to another.Of particular significance in this regard are
viruses, such as HIV, the virus causing Acquired
Immunodeficiency Syndrome (AIDS), and Hepatitis B virus
(HBV) which may even penetrate through a latex condom
that is not actually perforated but merely stretched,
although other organisms causing sexually transmitted
diseases (STD's) are also of significance. Agents
which are effective against these pathogenic agents,
however, are less common than those that will provide
an effect against simple skin bacteria or fungi and
must frequently be present at much higher levels to be
efficacious. This can cause difficulties if the user
is in contact with high levels of antiinfective agent
for prolonged periods of time. It would therefore be 
highly advantageous to provide condoms in
which an effective virucidal agent were maintained in a
"ready" state, available for quick or even instant
release as needed to counter the effects of possible
viral contamination.Chlorhexidine has the ability to kill the AIDS
virus and HBV, as well as numerous other STD causing
organisms, as shown in prior commonly assigned U.S.
Patent No. 5,019,096 and 4,952,411 and application
Serial No. 07/385,290, which are incorporated herein by
reference. 
The utility of nonoxynol-9 as an antiseptic, spermicide and antiviral agent is described in U.S.
Patent No. 5,073,365. EP-A - 0 247 251 and U.S. Patent No. 5,013,544 describe synergistic
spermicidal or sperm-immobilizing effects of mixtures of nonoxynol-9 and chlorhexidine. 
Previous disclosures of the use or
chlorhexidine in medical gloves, e.g. in U.S. Patent
No. 4,853,978, 
and the use of chlorhexidine gluconate and nonoxynol-9 in vaginal contraceptives,
particularly diaphragms, in EP-A - 0 247 251

<CLAIMS>
A condom having interior and
exterior surfaces and an antiinfective coating disposed

on the interior surface, wherein the antiinfective
coating comprises (a) an antiinfective agent selected

from the group consisting of chlorhexidine and
pharmaceutically acceptable salts of chlorhexidine and

(b) nonoxynol-9, wherein the antiinfective agent and
nonoxynol-9 are present in a ratio between 8:1 and 4:1

by weight, respectively, said antiinfective coating
being effective to deliver an antivirally effective

amount of the antiinfective agent within ten minutes of
exposure to a physiologic liquid.
The condom of claim 1 in which the
antiinfective agent is chlorhexidine and the amount of

releasable chlorhexidine is between about 1.25
milligrams and 8.5 milligrams.
The condom of claim 1 which is
formed from natural rubber latex and in which the

natural rubber latex is modified to saturate binding
sites for the antiinfective agent in the latex.
The condom of claim 2 which is
formed from natural rubber latex and in which the

natural rubber latex is modified to saturate binding
sites for the antiinfective agent in the latex.
