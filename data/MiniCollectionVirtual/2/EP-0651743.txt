<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to novel N-hydroxyurea and hydroxamic acid compounds. 
The compounds of the present invention inhibit the action of lipoxygenase enzyme 
and are useful in the treatment or alleviation of inflammatory diseases, allergy and 
cardiovascular diseases in mammals, especially human subjects. This invention also 
relates to pharmaceutical compositions comprising such compounds. Arachidonic acid is known to be the biological precursor of several groups of 
endogenous metabolites, prostaglandins including prostacyclins, thromboxanes and 
leukotrienes. The first step of the arachidonic acid metabolism is the release of 
arachidonic acid and related unsaturated fatty acids from membrane phospholipids, 
via the action of phospholipase A2. Free fatty acids are then metabolized either 
by cyclooxygenase to produce the prostaglandins and thromboxanes or by 
lipoxygenase to generate hydroperoxy fatty acids which maybe further converted to 
the leukotrienes. Leukotrienes have been implicated in the pathophysiology of 
inflammatory diseases, including rheumatoid arthritis, gout, asthma, ischemia 
reperfusion injury, psoriasis and inflammatory bowel diseases. Any drug that inhibits 
lipoxygenase is expected to provide significant new therapy for both acute and 
chronic inflammatory conditions. Recently several review articles on lipoxygenase inhibitors have been reported. 
See H. Masamune and L.S.Melvin,Sr.: Annual Reports in Medicinal Chemistry, 24 
(1989) pp71-80 (Academic), and B.J.Fitzsimmons and J.Rokach: Leukotrienes and 
Lipoxygenases (1989) pp427-502 (Elsevier). Compounds of similar structure to the object compounds of the present 
invention are disclosed in EP 279263 A2, WO 89/04299, EP 416609 A2 and WO 91/16298. The present inventors have worked to prepare compounds capable of inhibiting 
the action of lipoxygenase and after extensive research they have succeeded in 
synthesizing a series of compounds as disclosed in detail herein. The present invention provides novel N-hydroxyurea and hydroxamic acid derivatives 
of the following chemical formula (I) and pharmaceutically acceptable salts  
 
thereof; 
 
wherein 
R1 is C1-C4 alkyl or -NR2R3; R2 and R3 are each, independently, hydrogen or C1-C4 alkyl; R4 is C3-C6 cycloalkyl, C4-C7 cycloalkylalkyl, aryloxy C2-C4 alkyl, arylthio C2-C4 
alkyl, arylamino C2-C4 alkyl, arylsulfinyl C2-C4 alkyl, aryl, aryl C1-C6 alkyl, 
aryloxyaryl C1-C6 alkyl or arylthioaryl C1-C6 alkyl, and the aryl group in the said 
aryloxyalkyl, arylthioalkyl, arylaminoalkyl,
