<ABSTRACT>
A process detects arc discharges in a power cable (12) connecting a 
power supply board (10) and an equipment rack (11), the power supply board 

including a circuit breaker (13) operable at a preset current level, and said arc 
discharge occurring at a fraction of said current level. After the arc discharge is 

detected (by 15), a signal representing the presence of the arc discharge is supplied 
to a power supply control (16), and a control signal is provided by the power supply 

control to cause the circuit breaker (13) to open interrupting supply of power to the 
affected power cable.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to methods of detecting arc
discharges in power cables connecting a power supply board
and at least one equipment rack.Central telephone exchange offices utilize DC power to run various
telephone communication equipment. DC power is brought into the office to a main
switch (or power supply) board from where it is directed to various equipment by
power cables. The separation between the main switch board and the power cables is
provided typically by DC circuit breakers intended to shut down the equipment in
case of short circuits.Very often an arcing arises between conductors in the cable which if
undetected leads to a fire first hidden inside the cable cover and subsequently to an
observable fire consuming the cable. Arc discharges within a cable may arise due to
a number of factors one of which could be a fault in the insulation on separate
conductors in a multiconductor cable. Such a fault could be a result of a
manufacturing flaw or damage to the conductor within the cable. Such damage may
occur in the course of transportation, installation or use of the cable. Stepping on,
kicking or some other damaging act to the cable either during the installation or use
in the office may be a contributory cause of the injury.Arc discharges which may begin as an occasional sparking between
adjoining conductors within the cable, if undetected, may lead to a fire within the
cable. Arc discharges occur at relatively low current levels of from 0.5 to 10
amperes. However, a typical central office circuit breaker operates at 40-50 ampere
level. Thus, the circuit breakers do not recognize such arc discharges permitting the
arc discharges to continue with resultant overheating of the cable leading to a fire of
the cable and consequently in the central office.It is desirable to timely detect occurrence of arc discharges in DC power
cable and to shut down the equipment prior to occurrence of such arc discharges
which could lead to cable fires.According to this invention there is provided a method
as claimed in claim 1.This invention embodies a process for detecting arc discharges in power
cables connecting a power supply board and at least one equipment rack, the power
supply board including circuit breakers operable at a certain current level, said arc
discharge occurring at a fraction of said current level. After the arc discharge is
detected, a signal representing the presence of the arc discharge is supplied to a 
power supply control, and a control signal is provided by the power supply control

<CLAIMS>
A method of detecting arc discharges in a power cable connecting a
power supply board and at least one equipment rack, said power supply board including a

circuit breaker operating at a preset current level, and said arc discharge occurring at a
fraction of said current level, the method including

   supplying a signal representing the presence of the arc discharge to a
power supply control, and

   providing a control signal from said power supply control sufficient to
cause said circuit breaker to open thereby interrupting supply of power from the

power supply board to said power cable, wherein

   said arc discharge detection is provided by coupling a tuned circuit between
said power cable and ground, said tuned circuit including a capacitor (C), a resistance (R) and an

inductance connected in series and having a positive resistance, and said arc discharge
has a negative resistance which counteracts the positive resistance resulting in

oscillations or noise of the tuned circuit supplying said signal to the power supply
control.
A method as claimed in claim 1 wherein said arc discharge detection
is provided for each of a plurality of power cables.
