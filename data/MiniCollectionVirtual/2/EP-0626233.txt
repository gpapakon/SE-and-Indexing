<ABSTRACT>
The outer cover (2) partly encloses the storage tank (1) and the closure of the external heater inner space is formed by one or two closure rings (4) connected with the storage tank and the outer cover. The inner coating is fitted under heat effect on the inner surface of the storage tank. The closure rings (4) are firstly welded to the storage tank (1), and then after cooling of the welding positions the inner coating is applied. After extensive cooling and fixture of the inner coating the outer cover is fitted and welded to the one or two closure rings (4). The closure rings during welding are cooled with the outer cover.
