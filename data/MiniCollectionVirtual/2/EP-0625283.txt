<ABSTRACT>
A switching pad or plate consists of electroinsulating flat bodies (1, 2 or 11, 12) which extend essentially parallel to each other, to which is associated at least one current-conducting contact path (8, 8') and which bear disconnecting switches interconnected in series and which are actuated by pressing one of the flat bodies. Contact pins (5, 5') associated to the disconnecting switches are pressed by a spring force against a contact head (6) at the contact path. The contact pins (5, 5') are firmly connected by their end opposite to the contact head (6) to one of the flat bodies (1 or 11, 12). Each contact pin is movably held in a guide formed by an insulating flat body (3, 11, 12).

A switching mat or plate consisting of electrically insulating flat members (1, 2) or 
(11, 12) disposed substantially parallel with one another and with which at least one 

contact strip (8, 8') through which current flows is associated, and which has serially 
connected isolating switches which are actuated upon pressure on one of the flat 

members, whereby there are associated with the isolating switches contact pins (5, 5') 

which are movably held in a guide which consists of one insulating flat member (3, 11, 
12), the said contact pins bearing under spring force on the contact strip through a contact 

head (6), the contact strip traversing the area of the contact heads, the contact strip being 
in these areas connected only when a respective contact head is bearing on the contact 

strip, characterised in that the contact pins (5, 5') have their end remote from the contact 
head (6) rigidly connected to one of the flat members (1 or 11, 12) and in that the flat 

member comprising the guides for the contact pins associated with the respective contact 
strip is disposed between this contact strip (8, 8') and the flat member which is rigidly 

connected to these contact pins and in that the switching mat or plate comprises elastic 
elements which in elastically resilient manner space the flat member connected to the 

contact pins associated with a contact strip away from the associated contact strip so that 
the contact heads of these contact pins bear on the contact strip under spring force and 

in that there is on a side of the contact strip remote from the flat member comprising the 
guides for the contact pins a flat member which comprises depressions (7, 7') which allow 

movement of the contact heads of these contact pins. 
A switching mat or plate according to claim 1, characterised in that the depressions 
(7) are provided in the flat member (2) which is not connected to the contact pins and in 

that the guide for the contact pins is disposed between the two flat members (1, 2) and in 
that the contact strip (8) is disposed between the guide (3) and the flat member (2) which 

comprises the depressions (7).  
 
A switching mat or plate according to claim 1, characterised in that the guide for the 
contact pins (5, 5') is formed by one of the two flat members (11, 12) and in that the 

depressions (7, 7') are provided in additional flat members (21, 22) which serve as a 
covering and in that a contact strip (8, 8') is disposed in each case between the guide (11, 

12) and these flat members (21, 22) which comprise the depressions (7, 7') so that two 
circuits are formed which act independently of each other. 
A switching mat or plate according to claim 2 or 3, characterised in that there are in 
the depressions (7) respective sensors (15) which are actuated by the contact head (6) 

interrupting the contact strip (8) when a switching pin (5) is actuated. 
A switching mat or plate according to claim 3, characterised in that the contact strip 
(8, 8') associated with one of the flat members (11, 12) and the contact heads (6) cooperating 

therewith extend at a distance from the contact strip associated with the other 
flat members. 
A switching mat or plate according to claim 5, characterised in that the contact strip 
(8, 8') of one ofthe flat members (12) extends in each case in the middle between parallel 

branches of the meandering contact strip (8) of the other flat member (11).
