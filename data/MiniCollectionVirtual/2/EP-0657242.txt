<ABSTRACT>
An insulation detection circuit (7) senses the insulation between a wire electrode (5) and a work (6) while a 
machining discharge switching element (3) is on until the element (3) is turned off during or after the capacitor (4) 

of a power source circuit is charged. When the insulation is good, the switching element (3) is made to conduct and 
discharge for machining starts. When the insulation is not good, the switching element (3) is not made to conduct, 

but the charge in the capacitor is caused to flow to a release discharge circuit through a release discharging switching 
element (8) by turning on the switching element (8). When a current detector (10) detects that the discharge of the 

capacitor (4) is completed, both of the switching elements (3) and (8) are turned off.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a discharge device for a 
wire cut electric discharge machine, and more 
particularly to a discharge device for a wire cut 
electric discharge machine which monitors an insulated 
state between a wire electrode and a workpiece, prohibits 
discharge between the wire electrode and the workpiece 
when the insulated state is not acceptable, and allows 
electric charge stored in a capacitor to flow or 
discharge via another electric path. A wire cut electric discharge machining is carried 
out by intermittently applying a voltage between a wire 
electrode and a workpiece to cause repetitive electric 
discharge between the wire electrode and the workpiece at 
regular intervals for execution of machining. One cycle of such repetitive discharge operation 
includes a period where no electric discharging is 
carried out (i.e. a discharge pause period), during which 
the wire electrode and the workpiece are kept in an 
insulated state. This insulated state is broken when a 
discharge starts (that is, when the next cycle starts). 
Then, after the discharge in that cycle is finished, the 
next discharge pause period begins and thus the insulated 
state is restored at this moment between the wire 
electrode and the workpiece. However, there is a possibility of failing to 
restore the insulated state between the wire electrode  
 
and the workpiece for some reasons when the next 
discharge pause period begins after finishing one 
discharge operation. If the next discharge is caused 
between the wire electrode and the workpiece under such a 
poor insulated state, short-circuit current will flow 
without contributing to machining, thus lowering the 
machining speed. Especially, occurrence of this kind of 
short-circuit current tends to concentrate on the same 
local point; inducing deterioration of surface machining 
accuracy and breaking of wire. This is why the discharge 
between the wire electrode and the workpiece must be 
immediately stopped in the event the restoration of the 
insulated state is insufficient. To this end, it is necessary to surely detect 
whether the insulated state is restored between the wire 
electrode and the workpiece at the time when a discharge 
pause period begins after finishing one discharge period. 
Subsequently, if it is judged that the restoration of the 
insulated state is poor, a countermeasure must be taken 
to prevent electric discharge to be caused before the 
following discharge starts between the wire electrode and 
the workpiece. One of prior art
