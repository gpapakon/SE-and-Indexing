 are identical or different alkyl radicals having from 1 to 4 carbon atoms,
and m may be from 1 to 3 and y may be 1, 2 or 3, by quaternisation of compounds

containing tertiary amine nitrogen with halocarboxylic acids, characterised in that
there is added to the reaction mixture before or during the quaternisation reaction at

least one of the compounds of the general formula (I)


wherein R, R
1
 and R
2
 may be identical or different optionally branched alkyl radicals
having from 1 to 10 carbon atoms, which radicals optionally contain hydroxyl

groups, and n may be from 1 to 3.
Process according to claim 1, characterised in that R, R

Process according to claims 1 and 2, characterised in that the compounds of the
general formula (I) are used concomitantly in amounts of from 1 to 5% by weight,

based on the aqueous solution.
Process according to claim 1, characterised in that 1-alkanoylamino-3-dimethylamino-propane-3-carboxymethylbetaine
is used concomitantly as the betaine of the

general formula (IV).
Process according to claim 5, characterised in that betaine based on coconut
fatty acid is added.
