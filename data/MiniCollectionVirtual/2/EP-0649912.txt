<ABSTRACT>
A method comprising the steps of preparing crushed material by crushing nickel-hydrogen secondary cells; 
separating alkalis, organic substances, and iron from the crushed substance in order to obtain a separated material from 

which at least alkalis, organic substances, and iron are separated; burning the separated material to produce oxides of 
valuable metal to be collected; and processing the oxides by a molten salt electrolysis method by use of a molten salt 

bath for electrolysis. By this collection method, it is possible to efficiently collect electrode materials and others which 
are usable for nickel-hydrogen secondary cells. Further, compared to separation, refining, and smelting by ordinary 

chemical processings, this method realizes collection in a large quantity at a low cost.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a method of recovering
reusable metals from nickel-hydrogen rechargeable
batteries effective for recycling nickel-hydrogen
rechargeable batteries.Recently, the demand for rechargeable batteries have
been rapidly increasing as electronic products become
portable. On the other hand, nickel-hydrogen
rechargeable batteries have been improved as batteries
for unpollutive electric vehicles, for which expanded
future demand has attracted attention. In this way, the
expanded demand for nickel-hydrogen rechargeable
batteries is expected in future since the nickel-hydrogen
rechargeable batteries are superior in characteristics to
the conventional nickel-cadmium batteries as well as
causing fewer environmental problems. However, a method
of recovering reusable metals from used nickel-hydrogen
rechargeable batteries has not yet been established.
This is because the recovery through the conventional
chemical processing costs more than the employment of new 
raw materials. Therefore, development of a method of
recovering reusable metals from demand-expanding nickel-hydrogen
rechargeable batteries is desired for
environmental reasons as well.It is an object of the present invention to provide a
method of recovering reusable metals from nickel-hydrogen
rechargeable batteries, wherein reusable metals can be
recovered from nickel-hydrogen rechargeable batteries
efficiently with low cost, and effectively as well in the
aspects of recycling and environment.According to the present invention, there is provided
a method of recovering a reusable metal including nickel and/or a rare earth metal from a nickel-hydrogen
rechargeable battery comprising;
step (I) of crushing the nickel-hydrogen rechargeable
battery to obtain a crushed material, and separating
alkali, organic substances and iron from the crushed
material to obtain a separated component from which at
least the alkali, organic substances and iron are
separated,step (II) of obtaining the reusable metal to be
recovered as an oxide from the separated component by
calcination, andstep (III) of processing the oxide by a molten salt
electrolysis method with an electrolytic molten salt bath.The present invention will now be explained in detail.According to the present recovering method, the step
(I) is first carried out, wherein nickel-hydrogen
rechargeable batteries are crushed to obtain a crushed
material, and alkali, organic substances and iron are
separated from the crushed material to obtain a separated
component from which at least the alkali,
