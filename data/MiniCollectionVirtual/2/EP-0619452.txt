<ABSTRACT>
In an apparatus with an interior which is thermally insulated from the surroundings to the greatest possible extent, in particular in a refrigerating and/or freezing apparatus using powder-vacuum insulated walls, the housing walls are formed from a firm composite of an outer container (2), an inner container (5) and a gas-evacuated, coherent powder embedding (3,3') sealed off with respect thereto by gastight and gastightly joined foil layers.

<CLAIMS>
Appliance with an interior space insulated thermally from the 
surroundings, in particular cooling and/or freezing appliance with the 

use of powder-vacuum-insulated walls, characterised thereby, that the 
housing walls are formed of a firm composite of an outer container, an 

inner container and a contiguous compacted powder embedding which is 
evacuated of gases and sealed off against the composite by gas-tight foil 

layers connected to be gas-tight. 
Appliance according to claim 1, characterised thereby, that the 
evacuated powder embedding of the individual walls of the appliance 

stands in connection contiguously with merely one of the walls adjacent 
to the powder embedding. 
Appliance according to claim 1, characterised thereby, that the 
synthetic material foils are firm components of those sides of the inner 

container and/or the outer container, which face the powder embedding. 
Appliance according to claim 1 or 2, characterised thereby, that the 
synthetic material foils are at least partially adhesively connected with 

those sides of the inner container and/or the outer container, which face 
the powder embedding. 
Appliance according to claim 1 to 4, characterised thereby, that the 
rim regions of the inner container and the outer container are connected 

together. 
Appliance according to one of the claims 1 to 5, characterised 
thereby, that an underpressure-measuring equipment with underpressuredrop-signalling 

equipment is connected to the evacuated powder embedding. 
Manufacturing method for an appliance according to one of the claims 
1 to 6, characterised thereby, that powder is introduced into an outer 

container, which is laid into a press mould, with applied or inlaid gas-tight 
synthetic material foil and is compacted to shape by the inner 

container coated by a synthetic material foil and mounted on a press die  
 

and that the compacted powder embedding is subsequently evacuated of 
gases and the synthetic material foils are welded together to be gas-tight. 
Manufacturing method according to claim 7, characterised thereby, 
that after the hanging of the inner container into the outer container, 

the side regions are replenished with powder and compacted by press dies 
together with and/or subsequently to the compaction of the powder 

originally introduced into the region lying below. 
Manufacturing method for an appliance according to one of claims 1 to 
6, characterised thereby that the powder embedding is preliminarily 

prepared and preliminarily compacted between foils with contiguous side 
walls, which are folded into one plane, with edge fold constrictions and 

is placed folded on the inner container or laid folded into the outer 
container and completed by the inner container or outer container, 

respectively. 
Manufacturing method according to claim 9, characterised thereby 
that a final compaction and a gas evacuation of the powder embedding is 

carried out during or after the assembly of inner container and outer 
container.
