<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to an electric vehicle charging
connector assembly used for charging a power battery of an
electric vehicle.Social problems on environmental and energy affairs
have recently demanded provision of an electric vehicle
loaded with a power battery. Some types of electric vehicles
have been put to practical use. The power battery provided
in a body of the electric vehicle needs to be frequently
charged and accordingly, an external battery
charger needs to be readily connected to the power battery
of the electric vehicle. Use of a connector assembly has
been proposed for the purpose of connecting between the
battery charger and the power battery of the electric vehicle.The connector assembly used for the above-described
purpose includes a vehicle side connector body mounted on
the body of the electric vehicle and vehicle side terminals
enclosed in the vehicle side connector body. The terminals
compose a charging power circuit. The connector assembly
further includes an external connector body and external
terminals enclosed in the external connector body. The external
connector body is mated with and unmated from the
vehicle side connector body mounted on the body of the
electric vehicle so that the external terminals are connected
to and disconnected from the vehicle side terminals
respectively.Electrical connection between the terminals is unstable
in the connector assembly of the above-described type in
the condition that both connector bodies are not completely
intermated such that the terminals are completely interfitted.
Charging in such a condition may result in an electrical
disadvantage such as generation of arc between the terminals
of both sides. However, the conventional connector 
assemblies are not provided with means with which an operator
sees, during a mating work, whether both connector bodies
are completely interconnected or not. In this case, the
mating work may be completed even though both connector
bodies are not completely interconnected because of failure
or misjudgment by the operator and consequently, charging
may be initiated by mistake.Other examples of common connector assemblies, however
no connector assemblies specifically designed for electric
vehicle charging applications are disclosed in US-A-3,613,047
or US-A-4,808,127.Therefore, an object of the present invention is to
provide an electric vehicle charging connector assembly
wherein the operator can see, during the mating work,
whether the connector bodies are completely mated together
or not.A
