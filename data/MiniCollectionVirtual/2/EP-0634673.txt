<ABSTRACT>
A transparent ocular lens material comprising a 
condensation polymer prepared by the condensation 

polymerization of a monomer mixture comprising (A) an 
aromatic tetracarboxylic acid dianhydride and (B) at least 

one diamino compound selected from (a) a 
silicon-containing diamine, (b) a diamino-substituted 

benzene and (c) a diamino-substituted diphenyl. The 
ocular lens material is excellent in transparency, having 

high oxygen permeability and moreover, excellent in heat 
resistance, ultraviolet-ray absorbing property and forming 

and processing property. Therefore, the ocular lens 
material can be suitably used in contact lenses, 

intraocular lenses, and the like.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a transparent
ocular lens material, and more particularly to an ocular
lens material having excellent transparency, high oxygen
permeability and high heat resistance (high glass
transition temperature), and moreover having excellent
ultraviolet-ray absorbing property and excellent forming
and processing property, which is suitable for use as
contact lenses, intraocular lenses, and the like.Conventionally, for an ocular lens, especially
for a contact lens, excellent oxygen permeability has been
required as one of important physical properties because
there is a necessity to supply a cornea with sufficient
amount of oxygen through the ocular lens so that functions
of metabolism of corneal tissue would not be lowered.Also, for an intraocular lens, heat resistance
has been required as one of important physical properties
so that the intraocular lens can have sufficient heat
resistance during autoclaved sterilization of the
intraocular lens before inserting the intraocular lens
into an eye.Furthermore, a contact lens or an intraocular
lens, in which an ultraviolet-ray absorbing agent is used,
has been employed in order to avoid that bad influences
owing to ultraviolet rays are exerted upon eyes. However,
the contact lens or the intraocular lens, in which the
ultraviolet-ray absorbing agents is used, especially the
contact lens having high oxygen permeability, has a
problem in safety that the ultraviolet-ray absorbing
agent easily elutes from the lens.Accordingly, it is desired that an ocular lens
material which has transparency, improved oxygen
permeability and heat resistance, and is excellent in
ultraviolet-ray absorbing property is developed without
using an ultraviolet-ray absorbing agent. The prior art according to EP-A-0 426 088 describes an intraocular lens comprising a
polyimide being prepared from 4,4'-oxydiphthalic dianhydride and aromatic diamine
compounds.In JP-A-62057421 colourless transparent polyimide material is described which is derived
from aromatic diamine compounds and an aromatic tetracarboxylic acid dianhydride
consisting of two phthalic anhydride moieties connected by a SO2-bridge.The intraocular lens disclosed by EP-A-0 345 810 comprises a polyimide prepared from
2,2-bis(3,4-dicarboxyphenyl)hexafluoropropane dianhydride and aromatic diamines with a
bis(3-aminophenoxy) structure.The polyimide disclosed in WO-A-94/14874 is characterized by the presence of a certain
amount of an aromatic tetracarboxylic acid dianhydride consisting of two phthalic
anhydrid
