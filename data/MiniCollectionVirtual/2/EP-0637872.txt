tetraborate substrate (10), a central interdigital 

transducer (21, 31), and first and second interdigital 
transducers (22, 23, 32, 33) disposed adjacently on both 

sides of the central interdigital transducer (21, 31) in a

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a device structure of
surface acoustic wave devices used as filters of mobile
communication devices, etc.Filters in the form of surface acoustic wave devices
are widely used in communication apparatus, broadcasting
apparatus, measuring apparatus, etc. because of their
small-size, lightness, and high performance. Conventionally
severe narrow-band characteristics, and additionally small
temperature changes at center frequencies and severe
attenuation characteristics outside the pass band are
required of intermediate frequency filters used in analog
communication systems. In such applications transversal
surface acoustic wave filters, etc. having 0.03 - 0.1 % of
a 3 dB specific band width (hereinafter called specific band
width) on ST cut crystal substrates are used.In mobile communication, etc., replacement of analog
communication systems by digital communication system is
being studied for more efficient uses of frequencies and
privacy communications. Relatively wide specific band width
as wide as 0.3 - 0.5 %, flat group delay times, and
attenuation characteristics outside the pass band whose
values exceed those of the analog communication system are
required of intermediate frequency filters used in a digital
communication system. Portable apparatus for mobile
communication must be smaller-sized, and the surface
acoustic wave filters must be accordingly smaller-sized and
have smaller insertion losses.The conventional transversal surface acoustic wave
filter including two interdigital transducers has an
advantage that a required amplitude characteristic and a
phase characteristic can be designed independently from each
other. But a disadvantage of the transversal surface
acoustic filter is large insertion losses, and to obtain a
0.3 - 0.5 % band width, a number of finger electrodes are
necessary, which makes the device large-sized and its
attenuation outside the pass band insufficient. A known structure of filters with low losses and wide
bands includes three interdigital transducers each having
four pairs of finger electrodes neighboring on a LiNbO3
substrate. Its insertion loss is 10 dB, and a specific band
width is 20% (M.F.Lewis, Electron Letters, vol.8, no.23,
p.553 (1972)). But too large insertion loss and specific
band width are disadvantages of this filter.On the other hand, known small-sized surface acoustic
wave filters with small losses include resonator filters and
multi-electrode interdigital transducer filters. These
filters have structures which have been
