<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a styrenic resin
composition and injection- or extrusion-molded articles
prepared by molding the styrenic resin composition. More
particularly, this invention relates to a styrene-based
resin composition capable of providing for high impact
resistance without compromise in clarity and flowability,
a shaped article produced by injection-molding said
composition and having good clarity and high impact
resistance, and a shaped article produced by extrusion-molding
said composition and featuring satisfactory
clarity, high impact strength and high tensile strength
with a reduced anisotropy of physical properties.Because of its high rigidity, good dimensional
stability and low cost, styrenic resin is used in a broad
range of molding applications. Since this resin as such
is poor in impact strength, it is common practice to add
an elastomer thereto to thereby provide the so-called
rubber-modified styrenic resins for applications where
high impact resistance is required. However, this
practice has the drawback that incorporation of such
elastomer sacrifices the favorable inherent properties, 
namely high rigidity and clarity, of the base styrenic
resin.In the field of injection moldings of late,
there is a demand for molded articles of reduced weight.
To be light in weight, molded articles must be thin-walled
and, in order to meet this requirement, it is
necessary that the molded articles have high impact
strength and that the styrene-based resin composition
exhibits high flowability during injection molding.
Moreover, as far as injection moldings are concerned, the
residual strain produced during molding is a factor of
consideration. That is to say, it is known that a large
residual strain seriously detracts from the impact
strength of the molded articles, and therefore it is
necessary to minimize the level of the residual strain.
It is generally considered that a residual strain is
produced in the resin by fluid shearing during injection
molding, and for the purpose of reducing the residual
strain, it is essential that the resin have high
flowability during injection molding.As an attempt to meet the above requirements,
it has been proposed to increase the strength of the
molded articles by increasing the molecular weight of the
resin. However, this method has the disadvantage that
melt flowability of the resin is reduced to cause a short 
shot during molding operation, and if molding could ever
be done, a high fluid shearing develops to thereby
increase the residual strain.As a
