tires and including multiple carriages (16, 18, 20, 22, 30, 32) disposed 

about a central shaft (12) and carrying a plurality of circumference-defining 
segments (204), the carriages and segments being separable 

about a transverse plane (28) of the drum for removal and insertion of 
spacers (258) between adjacent aligned segments and suitable to alter the

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to methods and apparatus for the
manufacture of vehicle tires, and particularly to bead lock drums
employed in one stage of the manufacture of such tires.In the manufacture of vehicle tires having reinforcing cords
incorporated therein, generally the process includes forming a fabric in
which the reinforcing cords are embedded in a polymeric material. In
this fabric, the cords run in the cross direction of the fabric. Generally,
this fabric is formed into a cylindrical carcass on a rotatable bead lock
drum, this process involving the laying down of at least one layer of the
fabric around the circumference of the bead lock drum and with the
reinforcing cords of the fabric extending between the opposite ends of
the drum. In the art, the distance between the opposite ends of the
drum (measured generally parallel to the rotational axis of the drum) is
referred to as the width of the drum. The above described alignment of
the cords causes the cords to be disposed on the bead lock drum in what
eventually becomes the width dimension of the tire. As will be more
apparent hereinafter, bead lock drums also provide for at least partial
establishment of the height dimension of a tire, that is, the dimension of
the tire as measured from the inner rim, radially outwardly of the tire to
the outermost surface of the tire tread.In the manufacture of vehicle tires having reinforcing cords
incorporated therein, generally there is initially formed a cylindrical
carcass which comprises a plurality of cords aligned generally parallel to
one another and extending between the opposite ends of the cylindrical
carcass, and a layer or layers of flexible polymeric material within which
the cords are embedded. Following the formation of the carcass on the bead lock drum, a
pair of bead rings, which are nonexpandable and commonly made of
metal, are applied about the opposite ends of the carcass and a portion
of each end of the carcass is lashed back about the respective bead rings
to anchor the bead rings in position with respect to one another and with
respect to the carcass. The bead lock drum comprises a plurality of
segments which define the outer circumference of the drum and which
are movable radially of the centerline of the drum between retracted and
expanded positions. With the segments retracted and the circumference
of the drum at its minimum value, the bead rings are moved into their
respective positions adjacent the opposite ends of the carcass on the
drum. Various mechanisms have been employed in

means for independent movement of said fifth carriage means with

respect to said first carriage means, but being capable of being carried
longitudinally of said drum upon longitudinal positioning of said first

carriage means with respect to said shaft means,
sixth carriage means (32) movably mounted on said second
carriage means for independent movement of said sixth carriage means

with respect to said second carriage means, but being capable of being
carried longitudinally of said drum upon longitudinal positioning of said

second carriage means with respect of said shaft means, 
a plurality of circumference-defining segments (204), said
segments being divided into at least first and second sets (250, 256) of

said segments, the segments of each of said sets being of a length which
is less than one-half the overall desired width of said drum, said first set

of said segments defining the outer circumference of said drum on one
side of a transverse plane (28) through said drum and said second set of

said segments defining the outer circumference of said drum on the
opposite side of said transverse plane,
linkage means (234) mounting said first set of said
circumference-defining segments to said first and third carriage means

and mounting said second set of said circumference-defining segments to
said second and fourth carriage means respectively whereby movement

of said carriage means relative to one another and acting through said
linkage means effects radial movement of said circumference-defining

segments,
first and second radially expandable means (324) associated
with said fifth and sixth carriage means, respectively,
first and second camming means (328) associated with
respective ones of said fifth and sixth carriage means for urging

respective ones of said expandable means radially outwardly of said
drum to thereby lock respective ring beads of said carcass in spaced

apart relationship to one another, in concentric alignment with said shaft
means, in parallelism with one another, and in a transverse plane (28)

passing through said shaft means at right angles to the length of said shaft
means,
motive power means (334) associated with said fifth carriage
means for moving said fifth carriage means toward said third carriage

means whereupon said first camming means associated with said fifth
carriage means is urged into expanding engagement with said first 

radially expandable means which, in turn, expands into locking
engagement with its respective ring bead,
means (280) for effecting movement of said third carriage means
longitudinally inwardly of said drum to activate said first linkage means

to radially expand said first set of said circumference-defining segments
and simultaneously carry said ring bead locked to said fifth carriage
