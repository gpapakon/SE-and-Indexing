<ABSTRACT>
This invention relates to a laser marking 
method which comprises heating a base article having on 

its surface a thin film of a laser marking composition 
containing a color former and a color developer having a 

melting point of 200°C or above, and then applying laser 
light to the thin film. The method of this invention is 

capable of no-break marking with vivid color development 
by application of laser light, without causing discoloration 

of the ground even under a condition of 120°C 
or above.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a laser
marking method and a heat-resistant aqueous composition
for laser marking which develops color on irradiation
with laser light and causes no discoloration of the
ground even under the conditions of 120°C or above.A thermosensitive recording medium designed to
form a color image by melting and contacting a color
former with a developer and making use of a color reaction
by the two substances is known. For carrying out
recording with such a thermosensitive recording medium,
a recording system is generally employed in which the
recording medium is run with its color developing layer
in close attachment with a recording head (thermal head)
having a heat generating element. In operation of such
recording system, however, there are involved various
problems such as wear of the head, adhesion of tailings
to the head surface and sticking of the head with the
color developing layer of the recording medium.
Further, since the recording speed depends on the heat
dissipation time of the thermal head, it is hardly
possible to carry out high-speed printing and also there
is the problem of blurring of the color image due to 
heat diffusion.Recently, for real-time marking of letters and
signs such as maker's name, product name, date of
production, lot number, etc., on the surfaces of various
commercial articles, for example, electronic parts such
as IC's, resistors, condensers, inductors, etc.,
electrical parts such as relays, switches, connectors,
printed circuit boards, etc., housings of electrical
devices, automobile parts, machine parts, cables,
sheets, packaging sheets, cards, various containers of
foods and medicines, caps of containers, etc., the laser
marking system is popularly employed for its various
advantages such as high speed printing and capability of
fine marking. Such laser marking system is essentially
based on the principle that marking is made by breaking,
that is, laser light is applied to the necessary part
alone of the substrate surface to cause denaturing or
removal of said part of the substrate, or laser light is
applied to the coating film formed on the substrate
surface to remove the coating film alone, so as to
produce a contrast between the laser irradiated portion
and the non-irradiated portion of the substrate.Studies are being made for applying such laser
marking technique to said recording system using a color
former and a developer so as to perform marking not by
resorting to breaking but by making use of color formation
by a chemical change.
