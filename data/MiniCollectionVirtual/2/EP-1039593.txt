of the rare earth dopant has an energy level structure
including a ground level and a pair of laser upper level

population inversion between the pair of laser upper and
laser lower levels. A first exciting light source is

coupled to the gain medium for introducing first exciting

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a laser oscillator and a laser amplifier, and particularly to a solid-state laser incorporating a gain medium including a rare earth dopant species, and more particularly to a fiber laser.Rare earth doped lasers are key devices in optical data transmission systems, in laser processing systems and in laser medical systems. Examples of rare earth dopant species are erbium (Er), holmium (Ho), thulium (Tm), and praseodymium (Pr). The rare earth doped lasers include glass lasers (for example, fiber lasers), solid laser oscillators, and laser amplifiers (for example, fiber amplifiers).Erbium ions are excited by light from an exciting light source having a wavelength of 1.48 µm (microns) or light from an exciting light source having a wavelength of 0.98 µm (microns). When excited, they are raised to an upper laser energy level of 4I13/2, from which stimulated transition to a lower energy level of 4I15/2 is to be produced. Production of this stimulated transition causes an erbium doped optical fiber to exhibit gain spectra range from 1.53 µm to 1.57 µm with 1.55 µm as a central wavelength. Transition of erbium ions from4I13/2 to 4I15/2 has fluorescent spectra range from 1.50 µm to 1.60 µm. This means that a satisfactory gain can be obtained at 1.60 µm band by optimally setting wavelength of exciting light and fiber parameters, such as, the strength and length of fiber and the density of erbium dopant.Recently, attempts have been reported to make a shift of the peak of gain spectra toward a longer wavelength side with the fluorescent band (in the neighborhood of 1.60µm). As an example of an attempt to achieve such a shift. Ono et al., "Gain-Flattened Er3+-Doped Fiber Amplifier for a WIDM Signal in the 1.57-1.60- µm Wavelength Region," IEEE Photonics Technology Letters, Vol. 9, No. 5 May 1997 pages 596-598 describe that 200 m is the optimum length of silica-based Er3+-doped fiber for constructing an Er3+-doped fiber amplifier (EDFA), which exhibits uniform amplification characteristic in the 1.57-1.60 µm wavelength region.With regard to erbium, the above-mentioned shift of gain spectra, which is hereinafter referred to as "a gain shift", is hey technique in accomplishing amplification over a wide wavelength band. The gain shift technique is very important in next generation wavelength division multiplexing (WDM) data transmission systems.With regard to any other stimulated transition of erbium than the transition from 4I13/2 to 4I15/2, there is no example of an attempt to make a
