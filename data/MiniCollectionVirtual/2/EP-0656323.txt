<ABSTRACT>
A process is described for controlling the respiratory activity of microorganisms in a fermentation process, in particular in an activated-sludge process in waste water treatment, in which, depending on the nutrients supplied (substrate or waste water constituents) for the microorganisms, some of the supply is made unavailable to the microorganisms or is withdrawn from degradation by the microorganisms by addition of substances acting on the nutrients by adsorption and/or absorption (for example by addition of finely particulate hydrophobic and/or hydrophilic SiO2 derivatives, activated carbon, metal salts and the like), in particularly advantageous processes for development of a specific biocoenosis, a defined ratio of amount of oxygen fed to the amount of microorganisms and/or nutrient amount or to the amount of carbon dioxide developed per ton of chemical oxygen demand is maintained, by which means the amounts of sludge produced and the oxygen consumption can be decreased and improved dewatering is achieved.

Process for controlling the respiratory activity
of microorganisms in a fermentation process in

wastewater purification, in particular in an
activated sludge process in which, as a function

of the amount of nutrients supplied to the microorganism,
a portion of the amount supplied is made

inaccessible to the microorganisms or is withdrawn
from degradation by the microorganisms,


characterized in that
 this is performed by adding
substances that have an adsorbent and/or absorbent

action on the nutrients selected from the group
consisting of finely divided SiO
2
 derivatives,
hydrophobic and/or hydrophilic activated carbon,

metal salts and polymers, and by additional
addition of choline derivatives, a ratio of amount

of nutrient to amount of microorganisms being
chosen in the range from 0.05 to 1 g of nutrient

per 1 g of microorganism dry matter.
Process according to Claim 1, 
characterized in

that
 the choline derivative is choline chloride.
Process according to Claim 1 or 2, 
characterized
in that
, to develop a defined biocoenosis, a
defined condition for selection pressure is

maintained by choosing a ratio of the amount of
oxygen fed to the amount of microorganisms and

amount of nutrients in the range from 50 to 
2 000 kg per tonne of chemical oxygen demand (COD)

by varying the feed rate of the adsorbent/
absorbent as a function of the air feed rate, and

varying the amount of microorganisms in the
aerated activation tanks by controlling the return

sludge ratio.
Process according to one of Claims 1 to 3,

characterized in that
, to develop a defined
biocoenosis, a defined condition for selection

pressure is maintained by selecting a ratio of
amount of oxygen fed to amount of carbon dioxide

produced and amount of nutrient in the range from
50 to 2 000 kg per tonne of chemical oxygen demand

(COD) by adding a mixture of cationic polymer and
enzyme inhibitor as a function of the amount of

carbon dioxide produced.
