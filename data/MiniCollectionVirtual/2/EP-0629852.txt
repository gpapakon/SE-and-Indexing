<ABSTRACT>
The surface of the member to be inspected is covered with powder deposited 
by using, for example, static electricity prior to the flaw detection. The surface of 

the member can be covered with the powder completely or at a very small thickness 
so that the surface is partly exposed. Subsequently, the surface region of the 

member is heated by high frequency induction heating, and then the temperature 
distribution on the surface is measured with a radiation thermometer. The part for 

which the temperature measured is different from the surroundings is judged as a 
flaw. The surface of the member is covered with the powder so that the surface 

emissivity becomes almost uniform, and the resulting temperature distribution 
measured with the radiation thermometer becomes almost equal to the real one. 

Therefore, flaws existing on the surface of the member are precisely detected 
according to the measurement with the radiation thermometer even in the case that 

there are parts of low emissivity, such as handling marks, on the surface.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a method of and an apparatus for detecting flaws existing
on a member to be inspected such as a steel member.For detecting if flaws (including cracks) exist on a steel member, there is a
known technique wherein the surface region of the member is heated by high
frequency induction heating, and the flaws on the surface of the member are
detected by measuring the surface temperature of the member with a radiation
thermometer. This technique is disclosed in Japanese Provisional Publication No.
298846/90 and in corresponding United States Patent No. 5069005. As shown
more specifically in Fig. 23, the surface region of the member W to be inspected is
heated by using a high frequency induction heating coil 101 during transportation.
and after that, the temperature distribution on the surface of the member W is
measured with a radiation thermometer 102 arranged just next to the coil 101. If a
flaw exists on the surface, the temperature at the flaw is different from the sound
part (higher or lower than the surroundings, for example) so that the flaw is
detected according to this temperature difference.Although a member covered with scale can be adopted for the flaw detection
mentioned above, the member is treated by shot blasting as a pretreatment for
removing the scale prior to the flaw detection. The surface of the member W
becomes a glossy one (shot surface) after the shot blasting and reduces the
emissivity ε so that the temperature difference ΔT detected by the radiation 
thermometer 102, i.e., the level of the flaw signal decreases. Furthermore,
handling marks (for example, marks due to roller rubbing, bar applying or wire
applying) are easily formed on the surface of the member, and these marks exhibit
mirror-like appearance which is much more glossy than the shot surface so that the
emissivity ε decreases significantly thereat. The part of lower emissivity ε is
detected as a lower temperature part with the radiation thermometer 102.
Therefore, it may be difficult to judge whether the low temperature part detected
by the radiation thermometer 102 shows a real flaw or a handling mark. This may
cause a false detection of regarding a handling mark as a real flaw and may lead to
decrease in the detection accuracy.When the flaw detection is performed on a member covered with scale, the
handling marks by rolls, bars, wires, and so on, mentioned above may appear as
parts of scale peeling off. The emissivity is smaller also for such parts than for the
surroundings (scale), and the
