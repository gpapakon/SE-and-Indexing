<ABSTRACT>
A buckle device for temporarily fastening at least two straps (18,20) 
together, the device having a base unit (12); and an arm (14) rotatably 

mounted on the base unit (12). The arm (14) has a strap engagement 
portion (142) provided by a protuberance thereon, the arm (14) being 

movable from a locked position to an open position, the arm (14) 
in its locked position forcing the at least two straps (18,20) into 

engagement with each other between the engagement portion (142) and 
the base unit (12). The arm (14) is movable to an open position wherein 

the engagement portion (142) is rotated away from the straps (18,20) 
so that the straps (18,20) are free to move relative to each other and 

relative to the device.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to locking devices,
particularly buckles of the type which may be used with the straps
or cords and which have an over-center locking mechanism.Locking devices have been very commonly used in the prior art
to lock two straps or cords together by means of an intermediary
device. Such locking devices are commonly found on camping gear,
particularly backpacks; motorcycle and bicycle helmets; and other
sporting products. In the prior art such locking devices were
commonly and originally made of metal, but in more recent years
have been made from various plastic materials. One type of prior
art locking device comprised a buckle having two units which could
be locked together with one strap or cord secured to one unit and
another strap or cord connected to the other unit.One type of locking device is described in U.S. Patent No.
3,958,575. In this device, an elongated member is looped upon
itself to disposed ends adjacent each other after passage through
a fastener housing having clamping means. This device is used as
a constricting device for increasing pressure in humans and
animals.In addition to the lock-together type of buckle, cam buckles
have also been widely used in the prior art. Exemplary prior art
cam buckle include cam buckles sold under part numbers 100-0325,
100-0825, 100-0327 and 127-3200 by ITW Nexus of Wood Dale,
Illinois. Cam buckles have also been sold under part number 4535
by National Molding Corporation of Farmingdale, New York. In
these devices, one strap is secured to one end of the buckle and
the other strap is secured to one end of the buckle and the other
strap is fed through the buckle and is locked between two portions
of the buckle.Also in the prior art, bicycle helmets have become a widely
accepted accessory for bicycle riders. Indeed, in many states of
the United States, the state legislatures are requiring or
considering requiring all bicyclists to wear helmets when riding 
bicycles, similar to the legal requirements imposed on
motorcyclists to wear appropriate safety helmets. Conventional
bicycle helmets have a protective portion which protects the crown
of the user's head, with the lower edge of the protective portion
being typically placed at approximately at the top of the ears of
the wearer. Conventionally, a pair of the straps on each side of
the helmet have been coupled together by some means at a point
below the user's earlobe, with one or both straps then continuing
on to a releasable lock-together type buckle disposed under the
wearer's

<CLAIMS>
A device for temporarily fastening at least two straps
together, said device comprising:


(a) a base unit (12), and
(b) an arm (14) rotatably mounted on said base unit, said
arm having strap engagement means provided by a protuberance or

engaging portion (142) thereon, said arm being movable from a
locked position to an open position, said arm in its locked

position forcing the at least two straps (18, 20) into
engagement with each other between said engagement means and

said base unit, said arm being movable to an open position
wherein said engagement means is rotated away from said straps

so that said straps are free to move relative to each other and
relative to said device, wherein

said base unit has opposing side-walls between which is
received said straps,

characterized in that

said opposing side walls (124) are flaring
outwardly from a centerline of said base portion to accommodate

straps which diverge in use.
The device of Claim 1 wherein said base unit has an opening
therein sized to receive said at least two straps.
The device of Claim 1 further characterized by a helmet for
covering a portion of the head of a user thereof, wherein said

straps attach to said helmet and are arranged to converge
together and fasten by said device at a selected point near an

ear-lobe of the user.
