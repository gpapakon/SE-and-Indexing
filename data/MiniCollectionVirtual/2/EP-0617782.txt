<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to vapor compression cycle devices, such 
as refrigerators, air-conditioning units and heat pumps, using a 
refrigerant operating in a closed circuit under transcritical 
conditions, and more particularly to means and a method for 
variably controlling high side pressure of these devices. The invention relates to transcritical vapor compression devices, 
one of which is the subject of European patent application No. 
89910211.5. Standard subcritical vapor compression technology requires an 
operating pressure and temperature well below the critical values 
of a particular refrigerant. Transcritical vapor compression 
cycles exceed the critical pressure in the high side of the flow 
circuit. Since the most important object of the invention is to 
provide an apparatus and a method facilitating the use of 
alternatives to environmentally unacceptable refrigerants, the 
background for the invention is best explained in view of 
developments from standard vapor compression technology.  
 The basic components of a single-stage vapor compression system 
consist of a compressor, a condenser, a throttling or expansion 
valve, and an evaporator. These basic components may be supplemented 
with a liquid-to-suction heat exchanger. The basic subcritical cycle operates as follows. A liquid 
refrigerant partly vaporizes and cools as its pressure is reduced 
in the throttling valve. Entering the evaporator, the mixed 
liquid-vapor refrigerant absorbs heat from a fluid being cooled 
and the refrigerant boils and completely vaporises. The low-pressure 
vapor is then drawn into a compressor, where the 
pressure is raised to a point where the superheated vapor can be 
condensed by the available cooling media. The compressed vapor 
then flows into the condenser, where the vapor cools and 
liquefies as the heat is transferred to air, water or another 
cooling fluid. The liquid then flows to the throttling valve. The term "transcritical cycle" denotes a refrigeration cycle 
operating partly below and partly above the refrigerant's 
critical pressure. In the supercritical region, pressure is more 
or less independent of temperature since there is no longer any 
saturation condition. Pressure can therefore be freely chosen as 
a design variable. Downstream from the compressor outlet, the 
refrigerant is cooled at mainly constant pressure by heat 
exchange with a coolant. The cooling gradually increases the 
density of the single phase refrigerant. A change in volume and/or instant refrigerant charge in
