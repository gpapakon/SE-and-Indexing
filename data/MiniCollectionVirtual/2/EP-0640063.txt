<CLAIMS>
A process for preparing 1,1,1,4,4,4-hexafluorobutane, 
characterised in that a trifluoroethane compound of 

the formula (I)
CF₃-CXYZ   (I)

 
in which 


X and Y
independently of each other represent 
hydrogen, chlorine or bromine and 
Z
represents chlorine or bromine, 
 
is reacted with hydrogen in the gas phase and without 

a diluent on a palladium- and/or nickel-containing 
supported catalyst and the reaction product, 

optionally after separating out 1,1,1,4,4,4-hexafluorobutane, 
is subsequently hydrogenated. 
A process according to Claim 1, characterised in that 
CF₃-CCl₃, CF₃-CHCl₂ or CF₃-CH₂Br is used in the process. 
A process according to Claims 1 and 2, characterised 
in that 5 to 200 Nl of hydrogen are used for each 

100 g of the compound of formula (I). 
A process according to Claims 1 to 3, characterised in 
that the catalyst contains 0.5 to 20 g of palladium 

and/or 100 to 1000 g of nickel per litre.  
 
A process according to Claims 1 to 4, characterised in 
that it is performed at temperatures in the range 20 

to 550°C. 
A process according to Claims 1 to 5, characterised in 
that 1,1,1,4,4,4-hexafluorobutane is separated from 

the reaction product before subsequent hydrogenation. 
A process according to Claims 1 to 6, characterised in 
that the subsequent hydrogenation is performed in the 

same way as the reaction of the compound of formula 
(I) with hydrogen.
