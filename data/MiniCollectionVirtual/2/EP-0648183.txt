<ABSTRACT>
The bottom of a shuttle conveyor for transporting bulk and pourable goods has substantially parallel girders (1, 1') horizontally movable with respect to each other in the direction of the longitudinal axis, and means for sealing in a labyrinth-like manner the gap between adjacent girders (1, 1') so as to prevent material from escaping. Said means consist of an upwardly open gutter (3) arranged at at least one longitudinal edge of one girder (1') of a pair (1 and 1') of adjacent girders, and of an elongated projection (6) that points downwards into the gutter (3) and is shaped in the other girder (3) of the pair of adjacent girders (1, 1'). In order to reduce wearing to a minimum while ensuring a good sealing of the gap,the downward projection (6) is set on a marginal strip (17) that laterally enlarges the concerned girder and that covers the adjacent gutter (3).
