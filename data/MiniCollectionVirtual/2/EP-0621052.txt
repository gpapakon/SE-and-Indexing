<ABSTRACT>
Pressure adjustment valve for circuits for the manual 
administration of gas mixtures in the medical field, 

including a body (2) that can be interposed on the circuit 
of a manual respiration unit and has an intake port (3) and 

a discharge port (4). Inside the body (2) there is provided 
an adjustment valve (10,21) that can be positioned so as to 

vary the useful passage section of the gas stream in order 
to modify the resistance opposed by the adjustment valve 

(10,21) to the gas stream.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a pressure adjustment 
valve for circuits for the manual administration of gas 
mixtures in the medical field. As it is known, throttling valves having the purpose 
of adjusting the pressure of the gas stream are currently 
used in circuits for the manual administration of gas 
mixtures in the medical field. These valves, which are normally provided on a 
connector that mutually connects the manually-operated bag, 
the fresh-gas feed tube and the patient's connector, are 
currently constituted by a cylindrical body provided with 
intake and discharge ports for the required connections. Pressure adjustment is generally performed on the 
intake port by means of a disk which is pushed by an 
adjustable spring so as to act both as check valve and as 
flow throttling element according to the setting of the 
spring. These valves, in addition to being mechanically 
relatively complicated, are generally difficult to 
calibrate, due to the fact that calibration is performed by 
setting a spring, with the unavoidable expected errors; 
furthermore, this solution, which is based on the use of a 
moving disk, is liable to jam both due to difficulties in 
the sliding of the disk and because any secretions of the 
patient often reach the working area of the disk, with the 
possible risk of jamming it. The aim of the present invention is to solve the  
 
problems described above by providing a pressure adjustment 
valve for circuits for the manual administration of gas 
mixtures in the medical field which allows to adjust the 
flow without using moving parts and without having to 
provide elastic calibration means. Within the scope of the above aim, a particular object 
of the invention is to provide an adjustment valve that 
allows to always obtain an extremely precise adjustment 
that can be easily and quickly visualized outside, thus 
considerably facilitating its adjustment. Another object of the present invention is to provide 
a pressure adjustment valve that, by virtue of its 
particular constructive characteristics, is capable of 
giving the greatest assurances of reliability and safety in 
use. A further object of the present invention is to 
provide a pressure adjustment valve for circuits for the 
manual administration of gas mixtures in the medical field 
that can be obtained easily starting from commonly 
commercially available elements and materials and is 
furthermore competitive from a merely economical point of 
view. With this aim, these objects and others in view,

<CLAIMS>
Pressure adjustment valve for circuits for the 
manual administration of gas mixtures in the medical field, 

comprising a body (2,40) that can be interposed on the 
circuit of a manual respiration unit and having an intake 

port (3,41) and a discharge port (4,42), characterized in 
that it comprises, inside said body (2,40), an adjustment 

element (10,21,46,47) that can be positioned so as to vary 
the useful passage section of the gas stream in order to 

modify the resistance opposed by the adjustment valve (1) 
to the gas stream. 
Adjustment valve according to claim 1, 
characterized in that said adjustment element is 

constituted by a cylindrical skirt (10) insertable inside 
said body (2) and having, on its side wall, a slot (21) 

that runs along its circumference with a variable cross-section 
at the region affected by said discharge port (4). 
Adjustment valve according to claim 2, 
characterized in that said skirt (10) is closed, at the 

top, by a lid (11) that has a ridge (12) provided with a 
tooth (13) for coupling to a corresponding annular 

protrusion (14) formed at the top of said body (2). 
Adjustment valve according to claim 2, 
characterized in that an axial stem (15) extends from the 

bottom of said skirt (10) and can be inserted in a 
centering seat (16) which is supported by a cross-shaped 

element (17) located at said intake port (3). 
Adjustment valve according to claim 4, 
characterized in that it comprises a check valve that is 

 
constituted by a membrane (20) supported by said cross-shaped 

element (17). 
Adjustment valve according to claim 1, 
characterized in that it comprises, monolithically with 

said body (2), a bypass valve (35) which is constituted by 
a ball (37) arrangeable on a connecting opening (38) that 

connects the discharge port (4) to the inside of said body 
(2), and in that said ball (37) can be retained in position 

on said connecting opening (38) by virtue of its own weight 
and by the action of a permanent magnet (39). 
Adjustment valve according to claim 1, 
characterized in that said adjustment element is 

constituted by a disk-like element (46) which has a 
rotatable opening (47) at an inlet (45) that runs along its 

circumference with a variable useful section defined at 
said intake port (41). 
Adjustment valve according to claim 7, 
characterized in that it comprises a plug-like element (50) 

that can be arranged so as to close said body (40) and can 
be coupled to the upper edge of said body (40), said plug-like 

element (50) being rigidly rotationally connected to 
said disk-like element (46). 
Adjustment valve according to claim 8, 
characterized in that it comprises a notch (60) extending
