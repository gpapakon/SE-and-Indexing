<ABSTRACT>
A lifting apparatus (1) comprises a frame (30) and a carrier device (12) for carrying a load (2). The lifting apparatus includes two separate suspension devices (11a, b) which, by means of a line (13a, b) are connected with a rotary drum (14a, b) for winding or unwinding of the line. A switching device (15a, b) provided for each respective drum is disposed, in a first position, to interconnect the drum with a prime mover (16) for rotation of the drum (14a, b) in one direction of rotation in which the line (13a, b) is wound up onto or unwound from the drum. As a rule, the second drum is disengaged from the prime mover (16) when this drives that drum on which the line is wound up of from which it is unwound.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a lifting apparatus according to the 
preamble to the independent claim. There are needs in many contexts for a lifting apparatus which is 
arranged so that, while carrying a load, it may be moved from a first 
suspension device to a second suspension device. There are also often 
needs in this art to be able to move a load from one level to another. Examples of practical applications where this need exists are where 
goods are to be moved through an intake or discharge opening in a 
wall, when the opening is located above ground level and the wall 
above the opening separates an outer suspension device from a suspension 
device located inside the opening. It is obvious that a corresponding 
need exists when a load is to be moved from one loading 
apparatus to another, for example from a conveyor path suspended in a 
ceiling to a mobile hoist or crane, transfer of a patient sitting in a 
harness from one conveyor path to another conveyor path, to a bed, to 
a wheelchair, etc. The present invention relates to an apparatus which satisfies the 
above-disclosed needs. This is put into effect by an apparatus 
according to the characterizing clause of the appended independent 
claim. Expedient embodiments of the apparatus according to the present 
invention are disclosed in the appended subclaims. The present invention will now be described in greater detail hereinbelow, 
with reference to a number of drawings, in which:

<CLAIMS>
A lifting apparatus (1) comprising a frame (30) and a carrier 
device (12) for carrying a load (2), 
characterized
 
in that the lifting apparatus (1) includes two separate suspension 

devices (11a,b); that each respective suspension device 
(11a,b) is connected, by means of an elongate and flexible device 

(13a,b) such as a line, a strap or the like, to a rotary drum 
(14a,b) for winding up or winding out of said elongate device (13a,b) onto 

and off the drum (14a,b) respectively; and that a switching device 
(15a,b) provided for each respective drum (14a,b) is disposed, in 

a first position, to interconnect the drum with a prime mover (16) 
for rotation of the drum in one direction of rotation in which the 

elongate and flexible device (13a,b) is wound up onto or unwound 
from the drum. 
The lifting apparatus as claimed in claim 1, 
characterized
 
in that an operating device (26,27) is provided for 

displacing, on each occasion, only one of the switching devices 
(15a,b) to said first position. 
The apparatus as claimed in claim 1 or 2, 
characterized
 
in that the drums (14a,b) are provided with mutually 

parallel axes of rotation; that the drums are each provided with 
their circumferential gear rim (19a,b); and that the prime mover 

(16) includes a gear wheel (20) which is in mesh with the gear rim 
(19a,19b, respectively) of each drum when the drum is in said 

first position. 
The apparatus as claimed in claim 3, 
characterized
 
in that the drums (14a,b) are rotatably journalled in 

brackets (24a,b) which are, in their turn, rotatably journalled by 
means of journals (29a,b) in the frame (30) for displacement of 

each respective drum between said first position and a second 
oosition in which the drum is disengaged from the prime mover 

(16).  
 
The apparatus as claimed in claim 4, 
characterized
 
in that in the second position the gear rim (19a,b) of the drum 

(14a,b) is disengaged from the gear wheel (20). 
The apparatus as claimed in any one of claims 4 or 5, 

characterized
 in that the switching devices (15a,b)

in that the switching devices (15a,b) are displaceable, 

in the journal (36a,b), between a first position in which the 
switching devices retain each respective drum (14a,b) in said 

first position, and a second position in which the switching 
devices (15a,b) retain each respective drum (14a,b) in said 

second position.

characterized
 in that the switching devices (15a,b) 
are designed, in one end region of the guide surface (37a,b), 

with a depressed portion (39a,b) constituting a retainer member 
(39a,b) of the guide surface for fixedly retaining the brackets
