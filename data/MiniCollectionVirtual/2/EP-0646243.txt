<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to novel compositions, methods and test
kits which use the procedure of photoaffinity labeling with nucleotide affinity
probes, to detect neurological disease using cerebral spinal fluid, blood,
tissue, or other specimens in a mammal. The present invention provides a
method of diagnosis based on a disease-specific biochemical marker
macromolecule which, if present, can be identified in a small biological
sample from a patient. In particular, the present invention concerns
methods for diagnosing Alzheimer's disease or amyotrophic lateral sclerosis using disease-specific
nucleotide binding proteins and detecting the binding of these proteins in the
cerebral spinal fluid of a patient afflicted with Alzheimer's disease or amyotrophic lateral sclerosis.Alzheimer's disease (AD) is an idiopathic progressive dementia that
will affect a large percentage of our aging population. To date its etiology is
still unknown. The neurodegenerative disease is characterized by a
chronically deteriorating course of impaired intellectual function and memory
loss.Relatively little is known of the pathophysiological chain of events
that leads to the premature dysfunction and death of affected neurons in
Alzheimer's disease patients. Multiple abnormalities have been reported in
the brains of patients who have been diagnosed as having Alzheimer's
disease, but it is difficult to determine which of these are the result of brain
damage and which contribute to premature neuronal dysfunction and death. At the present time, the clinical diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease is
one of exclusion. Secondary causes of loss of memory and impaired
cognitive function may result from multiple infarcts, leading to so-called
multi-infarct dementia, or from intracranial mass lesions, such as subdural
hematomas, brain tumors, or granulomas. Central nervous system infections
of viral and bacterial origin, or even slow disorders such as
Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, are part of the differential diagnosis.
Furthermore, metabolic disorders involving vitamin B12 metabolism, thiamine
or folate deficiency, thyroid dysfunction, hepatic and renal failure, as well as
drug toxicity may appear as dementia. Nevertheless, when all these
secondary causes, many of which are reversible, are eliminated, cerebral
atrophy of unknown cause or Alzheimer's disease still covers the largest
number of patients.The definitive diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease is made by pathologic
examination of postmortem brain tissue in conjunction with a clinical
