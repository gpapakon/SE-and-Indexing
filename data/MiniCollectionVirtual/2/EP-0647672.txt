<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a highly flowable
and dispersible cured silicone powder that has minimal
tendency to aggregate or undergo blocking. The
invention also relates to a process for preparing said
cured silicone powder.Cured silicone powders are used as additives
in cosmetics, paints, inks, thermosetting organic
resins, thermoplastic organic resins, and so forth.
They are useful as internal stress-relaxing agents for
thermosetting (i.e., non-silicone) organic resins and
as surface lubricants for organic resin films. These
powders are fabricated by first preparing a water-based
emulsion of a curable silicone composition (hereinafter
a water-based curable SC emulsion), then curing the
composition to form a water-based dispersion of a cured
silicone powder, and finally removing water from the
water-based dispersion (refer to JP-A 63-77942 and
64-70558).However, the cured silicone powders
represented by this art exhibit a poor fluidity and
substantial aggregation or blocking tendencies.
Moreover, these prior art powders are poorly
dispersible in organic resins and organic solvents.Other prior art approaches to this problem
include JP-A4-348143 and JP-A 5-179144. The first of
these teaches a method for preparing a cured silicone
powder in which a silicon oxide sol is added to a
water-based dispersion of a cured silicone powder
(hereinafter a water-based cured SP dispersion) with
the subsequent dewatering of the resultant mixture.
The second claims a method for preparation of a simple
powder mixture which consists of dewatering of a water
based dispersion of a cured silicone powder plus an 
inorganic micropowder. The resulting compositions still
exhibit inadequate flow, dispersion, aggregation, and
blocking characteristics. Other drawbacks with these
approaches include the introduction of impurities, the
separation or removal of the inorganic micropowders
from the cured silicone powder, the inadequate response
to shear forces, and the like.US-A 5 153 238 relates to a composition comprising 100 parts
by weight polydiorganosiloxane and 100 to 800 parts by
weight reinforcing filler, eg fumed silica. The polydiorganosiloxane
can be cured. The size of the composition is in the range of
10 to 1,000 microns.The present invention introduces a highly
flowable and highly dispersible cured silicone powder
that exhibits little tendency to aggregate or undergo
blocking. An additional object of the invention is the
introduction of a process for preparing said cured
silicone powder.It comprises the combination of
(A) a
