Suitably flame-retarded compounds based on very 
low density polyethylenes result to be suitable for 

applications in which good flexibility, good 
mechanical properties and excellent fire behaviour are 

required.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to flame retarded
polymeric compositions essentially constituted by a blend of two different
very low density polyethylene grade
containing a system capable of supplying flame
retarding properties.The present invention also relates to the use of
such compositions in order to build suitable handworks
for coating, or lining, building structures, and, in
particular, motorway or railroad tunnels, for
protective purposes.It is well known that, thanks to its flexibility,
mechanical and flame resistance characteristics, poly-vinyl
chloride (referred to hereinafter as "PVC")
has proved heretofore to be the most suitable
materials for imitation leather, sealant tapes, films
and protective sheets. Furthermore, in those uses for
which particular flexibility (drapeability) and flame
resistance characteristics are required, such as in
tunnel lining and covering/coating building structures
in general, PVC proved to be the most suitable
material -- and the most widely used in the practice.Unfortunately, the use of PVC necessarily leads
to two main drawbacks:
(a) the plasticizer agents migrate with time, causing
a decrease in flexibility;(b) the flexibility decreases rapidly with decreasing
temperature;(c) when it is submitted to combustion, PVC releases
large volumes of hydrochloric acid and dioxines.Attempts to replace PVC in such applications were
proposed recently; however, the results were not
completely satisfactory.The problem is the subject-matter of a number of
Japanese documents (both journal papers and patents).In particular, Japanese Laid Open Publication No.
50-56451 claims a process for manufacturing opaque
films and sheets directly prepared from polyethylenes
with a particular Melt Flow Rate (MFR) value and a
specific Shear Sensitivity value, by extruding or
moulding polyethylene under well specified conditions.Another Japanese document, Japanese Laid Open
Publication No. 59/2 15343, claims a process involving
a compound of ethylene-vinyl acetate (EVA) copolymer
with a Linear Low Density Polyethylene copolymer
(LLDPE). In this case, the tensile modulus, heat
resistance and covering power of the film or sheet are
insufficient to meet the requirements.Furthermore, Japanese Laid Open Publication No.
H1-185306 claims a propylene copolymer with vinyl-trialkyl-silane,
in which the latter is contained at
a level of a few parts per million parts (ppm). In
this case, the film or sheet display both low
flexibility and low covering power values; however,
their strength can be
