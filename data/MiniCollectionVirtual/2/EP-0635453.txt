<ABSTRACT>
The supporting element comprises a main plate (13), to 
which two mutually spaced rolling heads (15) are rigidly 

coupled; the heads are simultaneously actuated by a 
conventional motor (16) by means of a transmission belt 

(17); the element also comprises a secondary plate (18), 
which is detachably coupled to the main plate (13) by means 

of a vertically adjustable vertical locking and 
disengagement column (19) which allows to lower or raise 

the secondary plate (18) with respect to the main plate 
(13); there are at least two interchangeable secondary 

plates (18-18a) which are respectively provided with two 
heating heads (22) and with two pneumatic heads (23) 

respectively for processing shrink-wrap capsules and for 
processing metal capsules.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a multipurpose 
supporting element for capsule application heads for 
bottles of wine, sparkling wine and beverages in general. As is known, bottles of wine and of beverages in 
general are provided, after bottling, with a capsule 
concealing the cap and constituting a seal that guarantees 
the contents of the bottle. Typically, sealing capsules are made of a shrink-wrap 
polymeric material or of aluminum and alloys thereof. These 
capsules are fitted on the neck of bottles and are then 
made to adhere to said neck with different methods 
according to their material. In the case of polymeric capsules, the heat-shrinking 
property of the material is used to make the capsules 
adhere by heating with matching heating heads. In the case of metal capsules, the capsules are made 
to adhere to the neck of the bottle by forming a series of 
longitudinal folds on the capsule by means of appropriate 
pneumatic heads and by then pressing said folds down onto 
the neck of the bottle, for example by means of rolling 
heads. If the axial extension of the capsule is limited, said 
capsule can be made to adhere to the neck of the bottle by 
means of the rolling heads alone. In conventional and current capsule applicators, the 
bottles are supported by a rotating carousel-like disk and 
are arranged on corresponding pans of the disk which are 
spaced with a constant angular pitch, and the heating,  
 
pneumatic and/or rolling capsule application heads are 
suspended above the bottles and supported by a supporting 
element that performs descending and ascending movements to 
lower and raise the head or heads onto and respectively from 
the bottles. In said conventional capsule applicators, depending on 
the type of capsule being processed, the supporting element 
must be provided with one or more capsule application heads 
of different kinds, suitable for the specific process. This 
entails the replacement of the heads or even of the entire 
supporting element when the type of capsule being processed 
changes; this is a considerable drawback both due to the 
downtimes entailed by the head replacement and adaptation 
operations and due to the possible need to supply multiple 
supporting elements dedicated to the different processes, 
with evident economical disadvantages. Known from EP-A-0366956 is a device provided with 
rollers made of a rubber-like material for advancing thin-walled 
capsules to the tops of beverage bottles, such as 
wine bottles. The rollers are brought into contact

<CLAIMS>
Multipurpose supporting element (10) for bottle 
capsule application heads, comprising a main plate (13), to 

which two mutually spaced rolling heads (15) are rigidly 
coupled, said heads being simultaneously actuated by a 

conventional motor (16) by means of a transmission belt 
(17), and a set of two interchangeable secondary plates 

(18-18a) respectively having two heating heads (22) and 
two pneumatic heads (23) respectively for processing shrink-wrap 

capsules and for processing metal capsules, and 
coupling means for detachably coupling any of the two 

secondary plates (18, 18a) to the main plate (13), said 
coupling means consisting of a vertically adjustable 

vertical locking and disengagement column (19) which allows 
to lower or raise the secondary plate (18) with respect to 

the main plate (13). 
Supporting element according to claim 1, 
characterized in that the main plate (13) is supported by a 

shaft (14) above a carousel disk (11) which has pans (12) 
for supporting a plurality of bottles, and in that said 

shaft (14) performs vertical ascending and descending 
operating strokes. 
Supporting element according to claim 1, 
characterized in that the vertical column (19) is 

accommodated within a retention bush (20) of the main plate 
(13) and in that said bush has an eccentric mechanism for 

locking and releasing the column (19) which can be actuated 
by means of a lever (21). 
Supporting element according to claim 1, 
characterized in that the heating heads (22) include an  

 
armored electric resistor (22a) which is coiled so as to 

form a cylindrical spiral and a presser (22c) which is 
coaxial to the resistor. 
Supporting element according to claim 1, 
characterized in that the rolling heads (15) include one or 

more peripheral rollers (15b) which are rotated by a pulley 
(15c) and by an actuation gear. 
Supporting element according to claim 1, 
characterized in that the pneumatic heads (23) are of the 

type comprising an elastomeric sleeve (23c) subjected to 
the action of a pressurized fluid.
