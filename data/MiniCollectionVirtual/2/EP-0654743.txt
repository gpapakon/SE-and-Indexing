<ABSTRACT>
A computer system (40) having a peripheral bus (52) and a digital 
signal processor (DSP) local bus (58) interfacing to the peripheral bus 

via an extended bus interface circuit (EBIC) (56). The DSP local bus is 
configured such that devices, which are typically two or more DSPs, 

electrically connected to the DSP local bus may transfer data to other 
devices connected to the DSP local bus regardless of data transfer 

activity of the peripheral bus. Moreover, as seen from the peripheral 
bus, the devices connected to the DSP local bus have the same arbitration 

level. However, as seen from the DSP local bus, each device connected to 
the DSP local bus has a unique arbitration level determined by the 

priority of the tasks executing on the respective devices, as determined 
by a DSP operating system.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates generally to computer system 
architecture and, more specifically, to a computer system having a bus 
interface circuit that creates a digital signal processor (DSP) local bus 
from a peripheral bus that allows simultaneous data transfers between 
DSPs on the DSP local bus and between devices on the peripheral bus. 
Personal computer systems are well known in the art. Personal computer systems in general, and IBM Personal Computers in 
particular, have attained widespread use for providing computer power to 
many segments of today's modern society. Personal computers can 
typically be defined as a desktop, floor-standing, or portable 
microcomputer that is comprised of a system unit having a single central 
processing unit (CPU) and associated volatile and non-volatile memory, 
including all RAM and BIOS ROM, a system monitor, a keyboard, one or more 
flexible diskette drives, a fixed disk storage device, and an optional 
printer. One of the distinguishing characteristics of these systems is 
the use of a motherboard or system planar to electrically connect these 
components together. These systems are designed primarily to give 
independent computing power to a single user and are inexpensively priced 
for purchase by individuals or small business. Examples of such personal 
computer systems are IBM's PERSONAL COMPUTER AT and IBM's PERSONAL 
SYSTEM/2. In computer systems, the components communicate via electrical 
signals. These electrical signals are typically carried by electrical 
connections between the system components. Typical types of electrical 
connections include metal traces on a printed circuit board, vias, plated 
through holes, plugs, and individual wires wrapped from pin to pin of 
system components. Typically groups of electrical signals and groups of 
electrical connections that carry the electrical signals are referred to 
as a "bus." Thus, a reference to a "bus" can indicate a reference to a 
group of electrical signals, a group of electrical connections that carry 
the electrical signals, or a reference to both a group of electrical 
signals that form a protocol and a group of electrical connections that 
carry the electrical signals. Systems can be said to have a variety of 
buses. A "local bus" is a bus that is, in general, synchronous with the 
CPU and designed to optimize the performance of the CPU. Most systems 
also have a "peripheral bus," which is either synchronous or  
 
bus. Peripheral buses typically have a number of interface slots, which
