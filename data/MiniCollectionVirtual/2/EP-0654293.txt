<ABSTRACT>
The waste water intake chamber (2) contains a trough-shaped solid matter collecting channel (12). The channel extends horizontally and parallel to the axis of the filter drum (6) below the free-overfall weir (4), when in collection position. A waste water distribution pipe (14) extends above the ground (13) and along the collection channel. This is connected to the water intake (3) via at least one distributor pipe socket (15). Collection channel, pipe, and socket may be pivoted about a horizontal axis into an area above the filter drum, to transfer the collected solids into the solids removal device (7).

A screening installation for the mechanical purification of waste water laden with 
heavy and lighter solids, having 


a housing (1), 
a crude waste water inlet chamber (2) with a crude waste water inlet (3) and an 
overflow weir (4), 
a screening chamber (5) with a screening drum (6) which is driven in rotation about 
a horizontal axis, 
a purified waste water outlet and 
a solids discharge device (7), 
 
wherein the screening drum (6) adjoins the overflow weir (4) and a screening drum upper 

part (at 8) protrudes above the overflow weir (4), characterised by the combination of the 
following features: 


a) a trough-shaped solids catchment channel (12) for receiving the heavy solids 
is disposed in the crude waste water inlet chamber (2) and in its solids 

catchment position extends horizontally and parallel to the axis of the 
screening drum (6) below the overflow weir (4), 
b) a crude waste water distributor pipe (14), which is attached to the crude 
waste water inlet (3) by at least one distributor pipe connecting piece (15), 

extends above the base (13) and along the solids catchment channel (12), 
  
 

wherein the solids catchment channel (12), with the crude waste water distributor pipe (14) 
and the distributor pipe connecting piece (15), can be swung out of its solids catchment 

position about a horizontal axis into a spatial region above the screening drum (6) for the 
purpose of transferring the heavy solids deposited in the solids catchment channel (12) to the 

solids discharge device (7). 
A screening installation according to claim 1, wherein the distributor pipe connecting 
piece (15) is simply placed on the crude waste water inlet (3). 
A screening installation according to either one of claims 1 or 2, wherein a swivelling 
lever system (16) is rigidly attached to the solids catchment channel (12) at both channel 

ends, and moreover can be swivelled about the axis of the screening drum (6) and is attached 
in addition to a swivelling drive (17). 
A screening installation according to any one of claims 1 to 3, wherein the swivelling 
lever system (16) consists of two elbow lever arrangements with a rigid elbow (16a), one 

lever arm (16b) of which is attached at its end to the catchment channel (12) and the other 
lever arm (16c) of which can swivel at its end about the axis of the screening drum (6). 
A screening installation according to any one of claims 1 to 4, wherein the swivelling 
drive (17) is constructed as a hydraulic or pneumatic cylinder-and-piston arrangement, which 

is attached on one side to the swivelling lever system (16) and on the other side to the 
housing (1).
