<ABSTRACT>
In this process for producing gaseous oxygen and/or nitrogen under pressure by distillation of air in a double column (9), pumping (at 13) of at least one liquid product withdrawn from the vessel of the low-pressure column (11), and vaporisation (at 8) of the compressed liquid product by heat exchange with air compressed to a high air pressure, all of the air to be distilled is compressed to the high air pressure and the excess fraction of this air is expanded in two series turbines (5, 6) to the pressure of the medium-pressure column (10), the air being partially heated (at 22) between the two turbines.

Process for producing gaseous oxygen and/or gaseous 
nitrogen under pressure, of the type in which : 


air is distilled in a double distillation column (9) 
comprising a low pressure column (11) operating at a pressure 

referred to as the low pressure, and a medium pressure column 
(10) operating at a pressure referred to as the medium 

pressure; 
all the air to be distilled is compressed (in 1, 4) to at 
least one high air pressure appreciably greater than the 

medium pressure; 
the compressed air is cooled in a heat exchange line (8) to 
an intermediate temperature (T1) and part is expanded in a 

first turbine (5) before introducing it into the medium 
pressure column (10); 
the non-turbined air is liquefied in the heat exchange line 
and then introduced, after expansion (in 20, 21), in the 

double column; and 
at least one liquid product withdrawn from the double column 
is brought (in 13) to the production pressure and this liquid 

product is vaporised in the heat exchange line (8) by heat 
exchange with air, the liquefaction temperature of the air 

being less than the vaporization temperature of the liquid 
product, characterized in that the said part of the air is 

expanded only to an intermediate pressure, the turbined air is 
partially reheated (in 22) in the heat exchange line by heat 

exchange with the air which is cooled, it is then expanded in 
a second turbine (6) to the medium pressure and introduced 

into the medium pressure column. 
Process according to claim 1, characterized in that the 
intermediate temperature (T1) is less than, more particularly 

about 10Â°C less than, the vaporization temperature of the said 
liquid product. 
Process according to claim 1 or 2, characterized in that 
the inlet temperature (T2) of the second turbine is close to 

the liquefaction step of air. 
Process according to one of the preceding claims in which 
air expanded in the first turbine (5) is then reheated by heat 

exchange with the non-turbined air intended to be liquefied. 
Installation for producing gaseous oxygen and/or gaseous 
nitrogen under pressure, of the type comprising a double 

distillation column (9) comprising a low pressure column (11) 
operating at a pressure referred to as the low pressure, and a 

medium pressure column (10) operating at a pressure referred 
to as the medium pressure, these means comprising a principal 

air compressor (1); means of compression (1, 4) for bringing 
all the air to be distilled to at least one high pressure 

appreciably higher than the medium pressure; means (13) for 
withdrawing at least one liquid product resulting from 

distillation from the double column and pumping it; a heat 
exchange line (8) putting the air and the said liquid product 

into a heat exchange relationship; and a turbine (5) for 
expanding part of this air, the inlet of this turbine being 

connected to an intermediate point of the heat exchange line, 
characterized in that the heat exchange line (8) comprises 

partial reheating passages (22) of which the inlet is 
connected to the exhaust from the said turbine (5), and in 

that this installation comprises a second expansion turbine 
(6) the inlet of which is connected to the outlet from these 

reheating passages and the exhaust of which is connected to 
the medium pressure column (10).  

 
Installation according to claim 5, characterized in that 
the two turbines (5, 6) are attached to the same shaft. 
Installation according to claim 6, characterized in that 
the shaft of the two turbines (5, 6) is firmly attached to the 

wheel of a blower (4) for boosting the pressure of the air 
coming from the principal air compressor (1).
