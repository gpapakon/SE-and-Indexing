<ABSTRACT>
A device for inscribing and/or reading information by means of a 
radiation beam comprises a frame (1), a turntable (3) supported in the frame, and a 

slide (7) carrying a scanning device (15) which is movable in radial direction (R) 
relative to the turntable. The slide (7) has a slide body made up of two parallel plate-shaped 

parts (19, 21), each of the parts having a side facing the other part and provided 
with a pattern of raised portions, raised portions of the one part being affixed to raised 

portions of the other part.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a device for inscribing and/or reading information by
means of a radiation beam, which device comprises a frame, a turntable for supporting a
disc-shaped information carrier, which turntable is supported by the frame, and a drive unit
for rotating the turntable about an axis of rotation, a slide which is movable in an at least
substantially radial direction relative to the axis of rotation of the turntable and a drive
arrangement for the slide, said slide having a slide body, a scanning device comprising a
stationary section and a movable section which is movable relative to the stationary section in
a focusing direction, the stationary section being carried by the slide body of the slide, and
the movable section carrying an objective lens for focusing the radiation beam onto a surface
of the information carrier.The invention also relates to a disc player comprising a housing and a device
according to the invention.A device as mentioned in the opening paragraph is known from EP-A-0 473
425 (herewith incorporated by reference). EP-A-0 473 425 discloses an optical player with a
slide which is movable along guide spindles of a magnetically permeable material and which
carries an objective lens and an actuator for moving the objective lens in a focusing
direction. The guide spindles are secured to a frame, which also carries a turntable for
supporting an optical disc. The slide, which is movable in a radial direction relative to the
turntable, is coupled to a drive arrangement comprising a magnetic yoke, which includes the
guide spindles, with a permanent magnet and two cylindrical drive coils, which are secured
to the slide and which surround the guide spindles. The slide comprises two supporting units
carrying rollers for cooperation with the guide spindles, and a pick-up body secured to the
supporting units and carrying the drive coils and the actuator. The known slide is of
comparatively intricate construction, is comparatively heavy and is comparatively bulky,
particularly its dimension in the focusing direction being large. Moreover, the known slide
has the problem, as is known per se, that energization of the cylindrical drive coils gives rise
to a comparatively large self-induction, which counteracts rapid variations in current strength 
in the drive coils.For design purposes modern optical players generally have to comply with
stringent requirements as regards a small overall height and a short access time. The known
device cannot meet these requirements.It is an object of
