<ABSTRACT>
A procedure for the extraction of polyhydroxyalkanoates 
from halophilic bacteria which contain them, using 

lysis or rupture of halophilic cells (for example, of the 
halobacteria type) which develop in media with high salt 

concentrations, by concentration by centrifugation, and 
then dilution-resuspension in a medium with low salt 

concentration, for example, fresh or distilled water, and 
then centrifugation, sedimentation, or filtration of the 

suspension obtained.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention concerns a process for the extraction
of polyhydroxyalkanoates, hereinafter referred to as
"PHA", produced from cells of halophilic bacteria.PHAs are accumulated intracellularly by many bacteria
in the form of granules. The use of these polymers as
thermoplastics requires their separation from the rest of
the cellular materials with an adequate level of purity.
For this, numerous methods have been described based on
the use of solvents and selective precipitants, which
methods extract the polymer PHA from the complex mixture
which constitutes the cellular biomass by means of a
process of dissolution and precipitation.US Patent no. 3,107,172 proposes spray-drying the
cells and using the resultant material directly for
casting. Other patents perform the extraction and
purification of the polymer using solvents in which PHA is
soluble and can thus lixiviate the PHA from the rest of
the cellular material. For example, EP-A-0 015 123
proposes drying the aqueous suspension of bacteria in a
current of gas at a high temperature and using mixtures of
solvents (dichloroethane, chloroform, etc.) and nonsolvents
(acetone and methanol) to recover the purified
polymer. Other procedures consist in concentrating the
suspension by centrifugation and treating it with acetone
to dry and rupture the cells. Then, the polymer is
extracted with an appropriate solvent (pyridine--US Patent
no. 3,036,959 or with a mixture of dichloromethane-ethane--US
Patent no. 3,044,942). Then, it is necessary to
recover the polymer and, finally, the solvent, usually by
rectification (for example, European Application EP-A-0 124 309).
US Patent no. 3,275,610 describes a method whereby the
cells suspended in water are subjected to the action of a
vibrating field to lixiviate the PHA. Once the cells are 
ruptured, the resultant mass is centrifuged and dried.
Next, it is treated with a solvent (chloroform) to purify
the PHA. This operation normally requires high energy
consumption. US Patent no. 4,101,533 proposes using hot
cyclic esters of carbonic acid, from which the polymer
precipitates upon cooling, avoiding the steps of solvent
recovery. It is also possible to extract the PHA directly
from the aqueous suspension of the cells without the need
to remove the water from it by centrifugation or drying
with gas with the direct use of certain solvents
(chloroform, dichloromethane, dichloroethane) although at
times in cells with hard walls, a prior grinding process
is needed to rupture the cells. This process requires
control of the
