<ABSTRACT>
A beverage dispenser comprising a dispenser body,
the dispenser being operable to dispense a beverage via at

least one outlet accessible externally of the dispenser
body is described. The at least one outlet may be

supported with respect to the dispenser body such that its
position relative to the body can be set by a user to

select one of at least two different vertical heights at
which dispensing is to take place. Alternatively or

additionally the dispenser may have two outlets supported
with respect to the dispenser body such as to be at

different vertical heights so that the user can select the
vertical height at which dispensing is to take place by

selection of the respective outlet.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a beverage
dispenser and in particular to a dispenser used to provide
hot beverages such as tea or coffee.Known coffee brewers include at least one storage
urn from which brewed coffee is dispensed via a tap. The
height of the tap is fixed. Accordingly, if coffee is to
be dispensed into a container of similar height, then the
container can simply be placed below the tap. However, if
the height of the container is significantly different,
then either it has to be tilted, if it is too tall, or it
has to be held in the hand or rested on a raised platform,
if it is too short, in order to avoid splashing or
spillage of coffee.The present invention provides a beverage
dispenser which in one aspect comprises a dispenser body,
the dispenser being operable to dispense a beverage via at
least one outlet accessible externally of the dispenser
body, wherein the at least one outlet is supported with
respect to the dispenser body such that its position
relative to the body can be set by a user to select from
at least two different vertical heights, that at which
dispensing is to take place.In accordance with another aspect of the invention
there is provided a beverage dispenser comprising a
dispenser body, the dispenser being operable to
selectively dispense a beverage via at least two outlets
accessible externally of the dispenser body, wherein the 
outlets are supported with respect to the dispenser body
such that they are at different vertical heights so that
a user can select the height at which dispensing is to
take place by selection of the respective outlet.A dispenser of the invention allows beverages to
be dispensed conveniently and safely into containers of
different heights, in particular it is able to accommodate
both a bulk container for holding sufficient beverage for
several people and a smaller container, such as a cup or
a mug, for holding sufficient beverage for one person.
This may be achieved through use of a single outlet with
the first aspect and with two outlets in the second
aspect.Preferably beverage is fed to the at least one
outlet by a flexible tube. This allows use of a fixed
storage urn for the beverage within the body of the
beverage dispenser.Suitably the at least one outlet is movable along
a substantially vertical slot formed in the body of the
dispenser. The outlet is thereby guided between the
different heights.Preferably the at least one outlet is carried on
a manually operated lift mechanism provided internally of
the dispenser body. A preferred
