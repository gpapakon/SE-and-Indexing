<ABSTRACT>
A process for producing an α-hydroxyiminophenylacetonitrile represented by general formula [II], (wherein 

R¹, R², R³ and Z are each as defined in the specification) by reacting a crude nitrile containing a phenylacetonitrile 
represented by general formula [I]
, (wherein R¹, R², R³ and Z are each as defined in the specification) with an alkyl 
nitrite in the presence of a base, extracting the reaction mixture with water, and neutralizing the separated water layer 

with an acid. This process enables target α-hydroxyiminophenylacetonitriles to be readily produced in a highly pure 
form in high yield by extracting the reaction mass with water and neutralizing the separated water layer with an acid.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a process for producing α-hydroxyiminophenylacetonitriles.α-Hydroxyiminophenylacetonitriles are known as intermediates of plant
growth promoting agents, agricultural fungicides, or the like (e.g., Japanese Patent
Publication No. 62-54096).As the process of their production, for example, it is also known that
α-hydroxyiminophenylacetonitriles are produced by reacting phenylacetonitriles with
alkyl nitrites in an alcohol solvent in the presence of an aqueous base solution, then
neutralizing with an acid, removing low-boiling contents by distillation, and collecting the
precipitated solids by filtration (e.g., Japanese Patent Laid-open Publication No. 54-163548).In the case where crude starting materials containing impurities are used as the
starting material phenylacetonitriles, however, there is a difficult point that α-hydroxyiminophenylacetonitriles
as the desired products have a decreased purity, if produced by
the above process.In the case where crude materials are used after purified by distillation or
other techniques, there is also a difficult point that complicated steps for separation and
purification are required and the yield is decreased by their operations or the like.The present inventors have extensively studied to develop a more favorable
process for producing α-hydroxyiminophenylacetonitriles by use of crude phenylacetonitriles.
As a result, they have found that the desired α-hydroxyiminophenylacetonitriles
can be produced with high purity, in high yield and with ease by reacting the crude phenylacetonitriles 
with alkyl nitrites, extracting the reaction mass with water, and then
neutralizing the separated aqueous layer with an acid, and they have further made various
studies, thereby completing the present invention.Thus, the present invention provides an industrially favorable process for
producing an a-hydroxyiminophenylacetonitrile of the general formula [II]:

wherein R1, R2, R3 and Z are each as defined below, characterized in that a crude nitrile
containing a phenylacetonitrile of the general formula [ I ]:

wherein R1, R2 and R3 are the same or different and are independently hydrogen,
halogen, nitro, trifluoromethyl, C1-C5 alkyl or C1-C5 alkoxy, and Z is -O-, -OCH2-, -S-
or -SCH2-, with an alkyl nitrite; extracting the reaction mixture with water; and then
neutralizing the separated aqueous layer with an acid.The present invention will hereinafter be explained in detail.As the substituents R1, R2 and R3 of the phenylacetonitrile [ I ] as the
