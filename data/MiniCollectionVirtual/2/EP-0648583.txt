<ABSTRACT>
A wrist structure 
is provided with first 

and second reduction 
gears (2, 3) which 

have a second shaft 
perpendicularly crossing 

a first shaft extending in 
the lengthwise direction 

of an arm (1), and a third 
shaft perpendicularly 

crossing the second 
shaft, and which are 

supported on both sides 
of a free end portion of 

the arm (1), which has 
a hollow (11), in such a 

manner that the first and 
second reduction gears 

can be rotated around 
the second shaft; a wrist 

frame (4) fixed to the 
output shaft (24) of the 

first reduction gear (2) 
and having a hollow 

(42); a first bevel gear 
(5) which is supported 

so that it can be rotated 
around the third shaft 

perpendicularly crossing 
the second shaft provided 

on the wrist frame (4), 
and which has a hollow (51); a second bevel gear (7) which is rotatable around a shaft parallel to the second shaft, 

and which is meshed with the first bevel gear (5); a gear (71) combined unitarily with the second bevel gear (7); a 
gear (8) mounted fixedly on the output shaft (34) of the second reduction gear (3) and meshed with the gear (71); 

and a tool fixing member (6) fixed to the first bevel gear (5) and having a hollow (61). Accordingly, cable and hose 
connecting operations can be carri
ed out easily, and the time required for such operations can be reduced.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a wrist mechanism provided at the
front end portion of the arm of an industrial robot.In the closest prior art according to JP-A-63-70 896,
there is disclosed a wrist mechanism comprising
at the front end portion of the arm of an industrial robot, a
rotary shaft rotating about a second axis perpendicular to a
first axis extending in a length direction of the arm and a
rotary shaft rotating about a third axis perpendicular to the
second axis, wherein two drive mechanisms for independently
driving the second and third axes are provided, thus to rotate
a tool fixing portion through a bevel gear about the second and
third axes.Moreover,
JP-A-61-168 487
discloses a wrist mechanism in which an
arm is formed by three shafts of the hollow structure in a
concentrical form, wherein an inclined rotary portion in a hollow form
rotating through a hollow bevel gear about a second axis inclined
relative to a first axis extending in a length direction of the
arm is provided at the front end portion thereof, and a hollow
tool fixing portion rotating through a bevel gear about a third
axis inclined relative to the second axis is provided. However, in the closest prior art according to JP-A-63-70896,
since the front end portion of the arm is occupied by two drive
mechanisms for independently driving the second and third axes,
cable and hose for supplying electricity and fluid such as
pressurized oil or pressurized air, etc. cannot be passed through
the tool fixed at tool fixing portion, and such cable and hose
are therefore disposed outside the wrist portion. For this
reason, there was the problem that in the case where the wrist
portion is rotated many number of times, cable or hose is wound
around the wrist portion, so the rotational operation range of
the wrist portion is limited.Moreover, in the prior art of the Tokkaisho No. 61-168487,
since while cable or hose can be passed through the hollow arm,
it is necessary to pass such cable or hose inside three hollow
bevel gears of the wrist portion and the hollow passage is
curved, there was the problem that at the time of work for
attachment/detachment of cable or hose, tool is detached from the
tool fixing portion and connector is then detached, so it would
take much time.An object of this invention is to provide a wrist mechanism
of an industrial robot in which there is no possibility that
rotational operation of the wrist portion is limited, and work
for attaching/detaching cable or hose for tool is facilitated.This invention is directed to a
