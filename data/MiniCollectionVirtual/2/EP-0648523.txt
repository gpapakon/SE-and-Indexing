<ABSTRACT>
Device for degassing a fluid, including means for entry 4 of fluid to be degassed and means for delivery 12 of degassed fluid, a vortex separator 2 the outlet of which is connected to the said delivery means 12 and which has above it an air purger 3. The device additionally includes a chamber 1 for separation by density, the entry of which is connected to the said means for entry 4 of the fluid to be degassed and which has at least one outlet connected to the said vortex separator 2 and an outlet connected to the said means for delivery 12. The invention also relates to a process for degassing a fluid, consisting in separating the fluid to be degassed into a flow weakly laden with gas and a flow highly laden with gas and in degassing only the flow highly laden with gas by forming a vortex.

<CLAIMS>
Device for degasing a fluid, comprising inlet
means (4) for a fluid to be degassed and discharge means

(12) for degassed fluid, a vortex separator (2) the
outlet of which is linked to said discharge means (12),

air purging means (3) being arranged thereover, said
degassing device being characterized in that it further

comprises a separation chamber (1), separated from said
vortex separator (2), the inlet of which is linked to

said inlet means (4) for fluid to be degassed and having
at least one separate outlet (8) linked to an inlet of

said vortex separator (2), and an outlet linked to said
discharge means (12) whereby in operation, the flow

leaving said separate outlet (8) unites, downstream of
said vortex separator (2), with the flow from said

separator.
Device according to claim 1, characterized in
that said chamber (1) is a separation chamber using

density.
Device according to claim 1 or 2, characterized
in that said chamber (1) further has, in its upper

portion, an outlet linked to said air purger (3).
Device according to one of claims 1 to 3,
characterized in that it includes means for regulating

the ratio between, firstly, the flow between said
separation chamber (1) and said vortex separator (2) and,

secondly, the flow between said separation chamber (1)
and said discharge means (12).
A method for degassing fluid, by forming a vortex
in said fluid, characterized in that the fluid to be

degassed is first divided into a flow having a high gas
content and a flow having a low gas content, and in that

only the flow having a high gas content is degassed by 
forming a vortex in a chamber (2), said flows not uniting

until downstream of said chamber (2).
The method of claim 5, characterized in that said
flow having a low gas content is separated, by density,

from said flow having a high gas content.
