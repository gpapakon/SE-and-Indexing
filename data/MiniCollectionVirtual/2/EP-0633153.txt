<ABSTRACT>
In order, in a heating and/or air-conditioning system, to be able to ensure, in a simple and noise-free manner, an edge-side peripheral sealing function, in particular even relative to curved housing walls (3), for a damper, over its entire swivelling region, a sealing hollow profile (1), which is sprayed on the edge side by its one free end (1.4) onto one surface side (2.1) of a plate-shaped base body (2) and is made of a thermoplastic elastomer, is positioned, after being removed from the mould, with its other free end (1.7) on the other surface side (2.2) of the base body (2) and attached by mechanical means.

Process for producing a heating and/or air 
conditioning device with a damper (1; 2) sealingly 

abutting a housing wall (3), especially for a motor 
vehicle, comprising at least a substantially plate-shaped 

base body (2) with a marginal rubber-elastic sealing 
hollow section (1) characterized by the following process 

steps: 

a) the sealing hollow section (1) is injected with in 
each case two wall portions (1.2-1.4 and 1.5-1.7 

respectively) which proceed from a sealing lug (1.1) 
provided for sealing abutment against the housing 

wall (3), with the formation of the sealing hollow 
section (1) and which open in each case in free ends 

1.4 and 1.7 respectively, with specifically profiled 
wall thickness, in a casting or injection mould; 
b) that free end (1.4) of the one wall portion 
(1.2-1.4) which faces away from the sealing lug 

(1.1) is injected onto the one surface side (2.1) of 
the plate-shaped base body (2) at the margin; 
c) that free end (1.7) of the other wall portion 
(1.5-1.7) which faces away from the sealing lug 

(1.1) is subsequently laid onto the other surface 
side (2.2) of the base body (2) at the margin and 

mechanically secured. 
Process according to Claim 1, characterized in 
that in a first working step the sealing hollow section 

(1) is moulded in the casting or injection mould and is 
injected with the free end of the one wall portion 

(1.2-1.4) onto the one surface side (2.1) of the base 
body (2) and is subsequently forcibly demoulded.  

 
Process according to Claim 1 or 2, characterized 
in that the sealing hollow section (1) is injected from 

an injection-moulded thermoplastic elastomer. 
Process according to one of Claims 1-3, characterized 
in that the other wall portion (1.5-1.7) of the 

sealing hollow section (1) is fitted at its free end 
(1.7), by margin-proximate passages (1.8), onto corresponding 

fixing pins (2.21) projecting out of the other 
surface side (2.2) of the plate-shaped base body (2) 

which preferably comprises a hard plastic material. 
Process according to Claim 4, characterized in 
that the fixing pins (2.21) are pressed down and spread 

out over the fitted-on free end (1.7) in the region of 
the passages (1.8), preferably by heat welding, in the 

sense of a positive fixing in the counter-fit-on direction 
of the free end (1.7). 
Process according to one of Claims 1-5, characterized 
in that at least the front-side housing wall (3) 

is designed to be curved in the sense of an abutment, 
sealing during a pivotal movement of the base body (2) 

about its pivot axis (2.3), of the sealing lug (1.1) 
which is preferably designed in the direction of the 

surfaces (2.1; 2.2) of the plate-shaped base body (2). 
Process according to one of Claims 1-6, characterized 
in that the cavity sealing section (1) is moulded 

in the one and the other wall portion with a first wall 
portion (1.2 and 1.5 respectively) which proceeds from 

the sealing lug (1.1) and which rises at approximately 
60° in relation to the surface sides (2.1; 2.2) of the 

plate-shaped base body (2) and in each case one adjoining 
second wall portion (1.3; 1.6) which falls again at 

approximately 30° in relation to the surface sides (2.1; 
2.2) of the plate-shaped base body (2) and which merges 

into the free end (1.4 and 1.7 respectively) secured to 
the base body (2). 
Process according to Claim 7, characterized in 
that the first wall portion (1.2 and 1.5 respectively) is 

moulded in each case, especially on account of reduced  
 

wall thickness, with a yieldability, which is elastic in 
the sense of an elastic abutment compensation of the 

sealing lug (1.1) at the housing wall (3), in comparison 
with the more pressure-rigid design of the wall thickness 

of the respective other wall portion (1.3 and 1.6 
respectively). 
Process according to one of Claims 1-8, characterized 
in that the sealing hollow section (1) is 

provided, preferably at the ends close to the pivot axis 
(2.3) of the plate-shaped base body (2), with outside 

openings. 
Process according to one of Claims 1-9, 
characterized in that the damper is designed as fresh 

air-return air damper in a heating or air conditioning 
device of a motor vehicle.
