<ABSTRACT>
2.1 In the case of known filler pipes (necks), it is possible that the pump nozzle will not be engaged in the position envisaged during the refueling operation. This can result in premature cut-off, splashing of fuel or damage to the filler pipe or body work. These disadvantages are avoided with the new filler pipe. 2.2 This is achieved by virtue of the fact that, in cross-section, the lower section (7, 40, 76) has an elongate hole (28; 102), the distance "a" of which between two lateral, parallel boundary surfaces (26, 27; 103, 104) corresponds approximately to the diameter "d" of the pump nozzle (13, 69, 70), that the length "l1, l2", perpendicular thereto, of the elongate hole (28; 102) over the length "L" of the lower section (7, 40, 76) is so great that the stop (12; 11, 71, 72) of a pump nozzle (13, 69, 70) can be moved over a holding lip or the like (14, 15; 44, 78; 61).

A filler pipe with an upper portion having sloping side walls as a help in 
insertion and an abutment for the depth of insertion of a pump pistol and 

with an adjacent smaller-dimension lower portion for guiding and securing 
the pump pistol in position in the radial direction, characterised in that the 

lower portion (7, 40, 76) is formed in cross-section with a slot (28; 102) 
having a spacing "a" between two lateral parallel boundary surfaces (26, 27; 

103, 104) approximately equal to the diameter "d" of the pump pistol (13, 
69, 70), and the length "l
1
, l
2
" of the slot (28; 102) perpendicular thereto 
and over the length "L" of the lower portion (7, 40, 76) is sufficient for the 

abutment (12; 11, 71, 72) of a pump pistol (13, 69, 70) to be movable 
along a retaining lip or the like (14, 15; 44, 78; 61). 
A filler pipe according to claim 1, characterised in that the abutment (12; 
11, 71, 72) after moving over the retaining lip or the like (14, 15; 44, 78; 

61) abuts the side walls (8) of the upper portion (6, 41, 75) and is 
subsequently guided by the side walls (8) downwards into engagement in 

a positive position-securing means (10, 43, 77). 
A filler pipe according to claim 1 or claim 2, characterised in that the 
retaining lip (14, 15, 44, 78; 61) is formed on the top edge of an insert (5, 

42) or a securing casing (4) or a structural unit (74) or a bayonet cap (54). 
A filler pipe according to one or more of the preceding claims, characterised 
in that as a result of the lateral boundary surfaces (26, 27; 103, 104) 

extending parallel in the direction of insertion, the pump pistol (13, 69, 70) 
can move only upwards and downwards in the vertical direction, and the 

shape and dimensions of the filler pipe (1, 33, 65) are chosen in dependence 
on the pump pistol (13, 69, 70) so that the pivoting angle "α" is about 10 

± 3°.  
 
A filler pipe according to one or more of the preceding claims, characterised 
in that the clearance between the lateral boundary surfaces (26, 27; 103, 

104) and the pump pistol (13, 69, 70) is dimensioned so as to obtain a 
pivoting angle "β" of about 3 ± 2° in the direction of the lateral boundary 

surfaces (26, 27; 103, 104). 
A filler pipe according to one or more of the preceding claims, characterised 
in that the bottom edge of the upper portion (6) is formed with a recess (10, 

43) for receiving the abutment (12; 11, 71, 72), and the recess (10, 43) is 
at least partly covered by a retaining lip (14, 15; 44, 78; 61). 
A filler pipe according to one or more of the preceding claims, characterised 
in that a drainage channel (39) is provided below the recess (10, 43) and is 

given a slope such that fuel reaching the recess (10, 43) flows into the 
bottom portion (7, 40, 76) or into the fuel container. 
A filler pipe according to one or more of the preceding claims, characterised 
in that the insert (5, 42) is a separate component which is so fitted into a 

securing casing (4, 45) that at least the top outer edge of the upper portion 
(6, 41) and, if required, a bottom outer edge (30, 24) of the lower portion 

(7) abut a bottom edge of the securing casing (4). 
A filler pipe according to one or more of the preceding claims, characterised 
in that the securing casing (4, 45) is formed with a vent opening (32, 46) 

and the upper portion (6) of the insert (5) is formed with a vent opening (9), 
especially a slot, and/or at least one groove (34, 35, 36) is formed in the 

bottom portion (40) so that fuel vapours can flow out through it. 
A filler pipe according to one or more of the preceding claims, characterised 
in that the securing casing (4, 45) is held and received in a ring (49), and a 

bayonet cap (54) is inverted over the ring (49).  
 
A filler pipe according to one or more of the preceding claims, characterised 
in that a channel (68) is formed in the filler tube (65a) below the securing 

casing (45). 
A filler pipe according to one or more of the preceding claims, characterised 
in that an earth wire (58) is disposed on the bayonet cap (54) and is 

conductively connected to the filler tube (65a) or to a vent pipe (2). 
A filler pipe according to one or more of the preceding claims, characterised 
in that the securing casing and the insert are incorporated in a structural unit 

(74), and a bearing (89) for a closure valve (90) is optionally integrally 
formed on the structural unit (74). 
A filler pipe according to claim 13, characterised in that the structural unit 
(74) is of plastics material and especially is injection-moulded.
