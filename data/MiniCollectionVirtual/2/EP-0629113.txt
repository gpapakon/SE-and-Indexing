<ABSTRACT>
A gasket assembly for sealing electromagnetic 
waves includes a canted-coil spring for blocking the 

propagation of electromagnetic waves therepast. The 
canted-coil spring includes a plurality of individual 

coils canted along a centerline thereof. A groove is 
provided for supporting the coil spring in a position 

enabling loading of the coil spring along a selected 
direction. The groove is provided with a selected 

surface for causing individual coils to always turn in 
a selected angular direction in order to control electromagnetic 

shielding effectiveness of the coil 
spring.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention generally relates to 
canted-coil springs and seals and, more particularly, 
relates to canted-coil springs retained in a cavity 
with interference between the spring coils and the 
cavity to retain the spring in a selected orientation 
for subsequent loading of the spring. Orienting the 
spring for major or minor axis loading enables a 
specific selected resilient, or load-deflection, 
characteristic in response to the subsequent loading 
of the springs. A description of the loading characteristics of 
various canted-coil springs is found in U.S. Patent 
Nos. 4,655,462; 4,826,144; 4,830,344; 4,876,781; 
4,893,795; 4,907,788; 4,915,366; 4,934,666; 4,961,253; 
4,964,204; 4,974,821; 5,072,070; 5,079,388; 5,108,078; 
5,117,066; 5,134,244; 5,160,122; 5,161,806; and 
5,203,849. All of these patents have been issued to 
Peter J. Balsells. It should be appreciated that cavities for 
supporting springs, as hereinafter discussed, may be 
linear or continuous with a desired shape, be it 
circular or otherwise. For use in circular cavities, 
a spring may have end coils welded together to form a 
garter-type canted-coil spring. Of particular interest are springs and cavities, 
or grooves, useful as a gasket assembly for 
environmental sealing, providing electrical 
conductivity, thermal dissipation and electromagnetic 
shielding.  
 Electromagnetic energy as used herein is a 
generic term including the full spectrum of 
electromagnetic energy frequencies, and specifically 
as used hereinafter, electromagnetic interference 
(EMI) and radio frequency interference (RFI) may be 
used interchangeably, with both referring to interference 
caused by unwanted electromagnetic energy or 
radio frequency energy entering a designated piece of 
equipment. In general, the ability to shield a component 
from egress or ingress from electromagnetic 
energy is often called shield effectiveness. A factor of prime importance in electromagnetic 
shielding is the frequency of the electromagnetic 
energy or the wavelength thereof. It is known that 
all electromagnetic waves consist of two essential 
components: a magnetic field and an electric field. 
These two fields are perpendicular to each other, and 
the direction of wave propagation is at right angles 
to the plane containing these two components. The 
relative magnitude between the magnetic (H) field and 
the electric (E) field depends on how far away the 
wave is from its source and on the nature of the 
generating source itself. The ratio of E to H is 
calle
