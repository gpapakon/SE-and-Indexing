<ABSTRACT>
A magnetoresistive read sensor based on the spin valve effect is 
described, in which a component of the read element resistance varies as 

the cosine of the angle between the magnetization directions in two 
adjacent magnetic layers (35,39). The sensor read 

element includes two adjacent 
ferromagnetic layers (35,39) separated by a nonmagnetic 

metallic layer (37). A layer (33) 
of nonmagnetic electrically conductive 

material is deposited adjacent to 
and in contact with at least one of the ferromagnetic layers (35) 

(referred to as a filter layer) to form a back or conduction layer (33) 
which provides a 

low resistance path for conduction electrons transmitted through the 
adjacent filter layer (35). The thickness of the 

filter layer (35) is selected 
such that it effectively blocks conduction electrons having spins 

antiparallel to the direction of magnetization 
in the filter layer (35) while 

allowing conduction electrons with parallel spins to be transmitted 
through the layer into the adjacent back layer (33). 

The magnetization of the 
filter layer (35) is free to rotate in response 

to an applied magnetic field 
thereby effectively varying the electrically resistance to conduction 

electrons in the back/filter layer. The thickness 
of the back layer (33) is 

selected to optimize the sensor parameters being measured and is in a 
range of about 4.0A to 1000A.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates generally to magnetic transducers for
reading information signals recorded in a magnetic medium and, more
particularly, to magnetoresistive read transducers based on the spin
valve effect.It is well known in the prior art to use a magnetic read transducer
referred to as a magnetoresistive (MR) sensor or head for reading data
from a magnetic storage medium surface at great linear densities. An MR
sensor detects magnetic field signals through the resistance changes of a
read element fabricated of a magnetic material as a function of the
strength and direction of magnetic flux being sensed by the read element.
These prior art MR sensors operate on the basis of the anisotropic
magnetoresistive (AMR) effect in which a component of the read element
resistance varies as the square of the cosine (cos2) of the angle between
the magnetization and the direction of sense current flow through the
element. A more detailed description of the AMR effect can be found in
"Memory, Storage, and Related Applications", D.A. Thompson et al., IEEE
Trans. Mag. MAG-11, p. 1039 (1975).More recently, a different, more pronounced magnetoresistance has
been observed resulting from the effects of spin-dependent-scattering of
conduction electrons in magnetic multilayered structures of the form
(F/NM)n where F is a ferromagnetic metal and NM is a nonferromagnetic
metal. This effect has been found in a variety of systems such as
sputtered Fe/Cr, Co/Cu, or Co/Ru multilayers exhibiting strong
antiferromagnetic coupling of the ferromagnetic layers, as well as in
essentially uncoupled layered structures of the form (F/NM/F) in which
the magnetization orientation in one of the ferromagnetic layers is fixed
by exchange anisotropy. The physical origin of the magnetoresistance is
the same in both types of structures: the application of a magnetic
field causes a variation in the relative orientation of the
magnetizations of adjacent ferromagnetic layers. The resistance of the 
structure changes as the alignment of the magnetizations changes from
parallel to antiparallel. This mechanism produces a magnetoresistance
that, for selected combinations of materials, is greater in magnitude
than the AMR, and is referred to as the "spin valve" magnetoresistance
(SVMR) or giant magnetoresistance (GMR).U.S. Patent No. 4,949,039 to Grunberg describes a layered magnetic
structure which yields enhanced MR effects caused by antiparallel
alignment of the magnetizations in the magnetic layers. As possible
