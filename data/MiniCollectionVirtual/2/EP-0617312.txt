<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a spatial
light modulator (hereinafter abbreviated as an SLM)
used in a projection-type display, a holography television,
or an optical computer.An optically addressed SLM is positively
developed as an essential part of a projection-type
display apparatus having a large screen size which is
an alternative to a thin film transistor (TFT) liquid
crystal panel or a cathode ray tube (CRT).An SLM performs a light amplification of a
two-dimensional image pattern. The SLM includes a
photoconductive layer and a light-modulating layer as
main components thereof. When image information with
low luminance enters the SLM from the side of the
photoconductive layer, the electric characteristics of
the photoconductive layer are modulated depending on
the luminance of the image information. As the result
of the modulation, the optical characteristics of the
light-modulating layer are modulated. Then, reading
light with high luminance enters the SLM from the side
of the light-modulating layer, whereby amplified image
information can be output.As the material of the photoconductive layer,
CdS, crystalline silicon (Si), amorphous Si (a-Si:H),
or the like is used. Among them, a-Si:H is widely
used, since a-Si:H has various superior characteristics 
such as high sensitivity to writing light, a low dark
conductivity, wide variations of film formations, and
the like. The erasure of the written image is performed
without using special erasure pulse light, so
that the photoconductive layer is often provided with
rectification.As the material of the light-modulating
layer, electrooptic crystals or liquid crystals are
used. Among such crystals, surface stabilized ferroelectric
liquid crystals (SSFLC; hereinafter referred
to simply as FLC) are positively used since the FLC has
a faster response (about 100 µsec.) as compared with
the conventional liquid crystal of the twisted nematic
(TN) type.It is conventionally known that the FLC has
bistability (the binary characteristics). Specifically,
the direction of spontaneous polarization of FLC is
changed depending on the polarity of the applied electric
field, so that the FLC has two different optical
states, i.e., ON (or UP) and OFF (or DOWN). The bistability
is described in detail in, for example, Appl.
Phys. Lett., vol. 36 (1980) pp. 899-901.In the case where the FLC is used practically
in a display or the like, the FLC must be able to
display a half-tone state between the ON state and the
OFF state. In order to realize the half-tone state,
the
