Device for varying an output pressure as a 
function of at least an input pressure, comprising: 


an elongated body (1) in which is formed a bore (1a) 
divided into at least two pressure chambers filled with 

fluid, the first (2) of which is subjected to the input 
pressure (Po) and the second (3) to the output pressure 

(P1), 
a first piston (4) sliding in the bore and serving 
to delimit the first and second chambers, said piston (4) 

having first and second pressure sections (S4a, S4b) 
respectively exposed to the pressures of the first and 

second chambers, 
a valve (6) carried by the first piston and 
cooperating with an element (7) fastened to the elongated 

body so as to be opened or closed by this element as a 
function of the position of the first piston in the bore, 

this valve being continuously open at any value of the 
input pressure lower than a limit value, in order to 

permit equilibrium of the fluid pressures in the first 
and second chambers by free volume displacement between 

these chambers, 
bearing means (8, 80, 81) exerting on the first 
piston an elastic force on which said limit value of the 

pressure depends and which urges this piston toward a 
continuously open position in which the valve is 

continuously open, and 
reaction means for exerting on the first piston a 

force increasing with the input pressure against the 
action of the elastic force and in a direction tending to 

move this piston away from its continuously open position 
and to offer at least partial resistance to any volume 

displacement from the first chamber toward the second at 
input pressure values higher than the limit value,
 
these reaction means themselves comprising: a second 

piston (5) sliding sealingly relative to the first and 
having a pressure section (S5a) exposed at least to the  

 
pressure of the first chamber; a deformable member (8, 

9) bearing at least against the second piston to receive 
a force which deforms this member as a function of at 

least the input pressure and to permit through its 
deformation a relative displacement of the two pistons 

toward a relative end position through the action of an 
increase in the input pressure; and locking means (10, 

11) able to prevent any additional relative displacement 
of the pistons when they have reached their relative end 

position, characterized in that the first piston (4) is 
at least partially annular and in that the second piston 

(5) slides inside this annular part of the first piston. 
Device according to Claim 1, characterized in 
that the bearing means comprise a reaction disk (8) which 

constitutes the deformable member. 
Device according to Claim 2, characterized in 
that the second piston is in contact with the deformable 

member by means of a surface, the ratio of which to the 
pressure section (S5a) of this piston is greater than the 

ratio (S4a/S4b) of the first and second pressure sections 
of the first piston. 
Device according to Claim 2 or 3, characterized 
in that the locking means comprise a transverse pin (10) 

fastened to the second piston (5), and a stop surface 
(11) of a radial aperture (13) which is formed in the 

first piston (4) and through which the pin (10) passes. 
Device according to any of Claims 1 to 4, characterized 
in that the valve (6) comprises essentially a 

ball (14) housed in the first piston (4) and pushed by a 
spring (15) against the inner edge of an orifice passing 

through this piston, and in that said element (7) 
cooperating with this valve is a finger fastened to the 

body and capable of passing through the orifice in order 
to push back the ball. 
Device according to Claim 1, characterized in 
that the valve (6) comprises an annular edge formed by an 

outer radial extension of the first piston (4), and in 
that the element (7) cooperating with this valve is a  

 
seal forming a seat for this annular edge. 
Device according to Claim 6, characterized in 
that the second piston (5) presents the same pressure 

section (S5a) to the first and second chambers, and in 
that said locking means comprise at least one axial face 

(10) of the second piston, this face being turned toward 
the outside of the first piston. 
Device according to any of Claims 5 to 7, characterized 
in that the deformable member (9) is a spring 

which pushes back the second piston (5) in a direction 
tending to oppose the relative displacement of this 

second piston in relation to the first in the direction 
of the relative end position of these pistons.
