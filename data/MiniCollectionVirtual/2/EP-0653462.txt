<ABSTRACT>
Thermoplastic molding compositions containing 

(i) polybutylene terephthalate 
(ii) a first aromatic polycarbonate resin, and 
(iii) a second aromatic polycarbonate resin 
 
are disclosed. A high level of Total Light Transmission (herein TLT) 

is a key characteristic of the compositions of the invention. 
Preferably, the TLT values of the compositions are higher than those 

of compositions which contain only said (i) and either (ii) or (iii). Most 
preferably, the TLT values of the compositions are higher than 80%.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to thermoplastic molding compositions 
and more particularly to compositions containing polybutylene 
terephthalate. Thermoplastic molding compositions containing 
(i) polybutylene terephthalate (ii) a first aromatic polycarbonate resin, and (iii) a second aromatic polycarbonate resin  
are disclosed. A high level of Total Light Transmission (herein TLT) 
is a key characteristic of the compositions of the invention. 
Preferably, the TLT values of the compositions are higher than those 
of compositions which contain only said (i) and either (ii) or (iii). Most 
preferably, the TLT values of the compositions are higher than 80%. Thermoplastic molding compositions are being used in a wide 
variety of applications because of their attractive profile of mechanical 
and physical properties. A key property for many applications is the 
transparency of the composition. Blends of polycarbonates and 
polybutylene terephthalate (herein PBT) are known and compositions 
containing the blend are characterized by high impact and chemical 
resistance properties. It has been the experience of workers in the 
art that blends of PBT and polycarbonate are opaque.  A commercial terephthalates of ethylene glycol and 
cyclohexane dimethanol and polycarbonate is noted for its 
transparency. A co-pending patent application Serial No. 08/093,834, 
filed July 19, 1993, refers to a transparent composition containing 
polyethylene terephthalate. It is an object of the present invention to provide thermoplastic 
compositions containing PBT and polycarbonate resins which exhibit 
improved TLT values. Accordingly there are disclosed thermoplastic molding 
compositions which contain (i) polyethylene terephthalate (ii) a first 
aromatic polycarbonate resin and (iii) a second aromatic 
polycarbonate resin which differs from said first in that it contains at 
least some structural units derived from a dihydroxy compound having 
a bridging unit corresponding to 
wherein R³ and R⁴ independently one of the other represent a 
hydrogen atom or a C₁₋₆, alkyl and X denotes carbon, with the proviso 
that R³ and R⁴ both represent an alkyl radical on at 
least one of the X carbon atoms, and where m is an integer of 4 to 
10. Preferably, the second aromatic polycarbonate resin contains 
about 10 to 100%, most preferably about 30 to 80% of said structural 
units.  The invention thus also relates to a method for increasing the 
TLT values of a thermoplastic molding composition which contains (i) 
polybutylene terephthalate and
