<ABSTRACT>
A device for transfer of personnel or cargo between a fixed or floating installation and a boat in a high sea, comprises a boom which is pivoted around a horizontal axis on the installation and which projects over an area to which a boat deck can be manoeuvred. The boom is upwardly suspended and equipped with a longitudinal transport passage. From the boom's outer end a wire or rope connection can be dropped and connected with a boat deck in such a manner that the wire or rope connection when ready for use is stretched taut between the boat deck and the upwardly suspended end of the boom. The rope connection is kept taut and at an approximately constant length since the boom's suspension follows the boat's movements in the waves. The rope connection controls transport devices between the end of the boom and the boat deck in the form of a rescue sock, slide or lift.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention concerns a device for transfer of personnel or 
cargo between a fixed or floating installation and a boat in a 
high sea. The installation may, e.g., be an oil platform, a quay or a 
loading ramp on shore. The boat may be a rescue vessel, a cargo 
boat, a passenger ship, a fishing boat or the like. 
In one embodiment, the primary application of the device can be 
as a means of evacuation between the installation and the boat. 
In a second embodiment, the device can principally be intended 
to function as a routine means of transport for personnel or 
cargo, to and from an installation where wave motion or other 
factors often make traditional connections by crane, gangway or 
the like difficult, time consuming or hazardous. One of the most important of the applications of the invention 
will be the transfer of personnel and/or lighter goods between 
oil platforms and so-called standby vessels or supply vessels. 
These vessels are very easy to manoeuvre and capable of coming 
relatively close alongside the platform and maintaining 
relatively precisely the same position for extended periods 
even in a high sea. However, even these vessels will suffer 
motion amplitudes both horizontally and vertically which 
greatly complicate cargo and personnel transfer between the 
vessels and the platforms. For heavier goods this problem is 
generally solved by packing the goods securely in extremely 
solid steel containers which can withstand heavy blows against 
the boat deck or against other cargo. Nevertheless, there will 
naturally be limits to the how rough the sea can be during 
which it is practically possible to perform such loading 
operations with present day equipment. For transfer of cargo 
between two floating installations or where loading operations 
have to be performed with a crane which itself is vulnerable to 
wave motion, there exist so-called active or passive heave 
compensation systems. These help to limit the cargo's wave  
 
accelerations either by suspending the cargo by a spring system, e.g. pneumatically, or by 
registering the cargo's acceleration or position by a sensor and processing it in a computer 
which transmits output control signals to the crane in order to compensate for the inadvertent 
movements caused by the waves. These systems can stabilise the cargo's movements during 
the cargo transfer, but they still do not remove the horizontal and vertical shock loadings 
which can occur when the cargo is lowered on to a boat deck which itself is in motion. The

<CLAIMS>
A device for transfer of personnel or cargo between a fixed or floating installation and 
a boat (9) in a high sea,
 
characterized in that a boom (2,26) equipped with a longitudinal transport passage is pivoted 

around a horizontal axis on the installation, that one outer end of the boom (2,26) projects 
over a position to which a boat deck can be manoeuvred, that there is set up at least one 

approximately vertical rope or wire connection (6,16) of approximately constant length 
between the deck and the outer end of the boom (2,26), that the outer end of the boom (2,26) 

is upwardly suspended around the said horizontal axis, thus keeping the rope or wire taut 
despite the movements of the boat in the waves, and that the rope or wire connection (6,16) 

serve as a guide rope or guide wire for a transport means in the form of a chutelike rescue 
sock (15), slide, lift, stairway, gangway or the like between the outer end of the boom (2,26) 

and the boat deck. 
A device according to claim 1,
 
characterized in that the boom is upwardly suspended by means of a passive spring device (1), 

that the boat is equipped with a winch (23), that a rope or wire connection (6,16) is 
established by dropping the rope on to the boat deck from the outer end of the boom (2,26), 

that the rope is connected to the said winch (23), and that the winch (23) is dimensioned so as 
to pull the boom (2,26) closer to the boat deck by overcoming the boom's upwardly directed 

spring force, and that the winch pulls the boom so far down that the upwardly directed spring 
force preferably during the entire course of the wave motion becomes greater than the weight 

of the cargo which has to be suspended between the outer end of the boom (2,26) and the 
boat deck. 
A device according to claim 2,
 
characterized in that the passive spring device (1) comprises a hydraulic cylinder (5) connected 

to a hydropneumatic accumulator (5,7), and that the spring characteristic can be adjusted by 
altering the amount of gas and/or liquid in the accumulator with pump and/or valve devices 

(10,11) provided for this purpose.  
 
A device according to claim 1,
 
characterized in that the outer end of the boom (2,26) is upwardly suspended by means of the 

tensile force in a wire (4) stretched from a point out on the arm (3) of the boom (2,26) and 
upwards directly or via a pulley to a slipping winch permanently connected to the same 

installation as the boom's pivot axis. 
A device according to claim 1,
 
characterized in that the boom (2,26) is upwardly suspended by means of an active 

hydropneumatic spring system, whereby a tension sensor (13) in the rope connection (6,16) to 
the boat deck provides continuous control signals via a computer (12) to pumps and valves 

(10,11) in order to adjust the spring forces depending on the tension in the said rope 
connection (6,16). 
A device according to one or more of the preceding claims,
 
characterized in that a winch (23) on the boat deck which maintains the rope or wire 

connection (6,16) with the end of the boom (2,26) has a slipping clutch which ensures that a 
little more rope is paid out temporarily if the sluggishness in the boom's or the cargo's 

movements causes tension in the rope which exceeds a calculated tolerance limit. 
A device according to claim 6,
 
characterized in that the winch (23) temporarily reels in more rope if the tension in the rope 

due to sluggishness in the boom's or the cargo's movements falls below a predetermined 
tolerance limit in particularly large individual waves. 
A device according to one or more of the preceding claims,
 
characterized in that there are at least two independent rope connections (16,18) between the 

boom and the boat deck, the first (18) of which rope connections is intended to keep the boom 
(2,26) at as constant a height as possible over the boat deck, while a second rope connection 

(16) is connected to a slipping winch which does not have sufficient tensile force to overcome 
the boom's spring forces, but which supplies sufficient tensile force to
  
 

keep the rope taut, thus enabling it to be suitable for use as a guide rope for the transport 
means even though the distance between the end of the boom and the boat deck should vary 

somewhat despite the first rope connection (18).
