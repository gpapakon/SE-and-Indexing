<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to superconducting 
wire using oxide superconductors, especially, relates to 
superconducting coils, superconducting current leads, 
and superconducting cables having preferable degree of 
uniformity in magnetic field and stability, and 
superconducting apparatus using same. Oxide superconductors have been extensively 
investigated since the discovery of Y1Ba2Cu3O7-δ (M. K. Wu, 
J. R. Ashburn, C. T. Torng, Y. Q. Wand and C. W. Chu: 
Phys. Rev. Letter, 58 (1987) 908) having a critical 
temperature higher than a liquid nitrogen temperature 
with the discovery of (La/Ba)2Cu1O4-δ as a starting point, 
because realization of superconductor applied apparatus  
 
operable at the liquid nitrogen temperature can be 
expected. Especially, development of materials having higher 
critical temperature than previous one is remarkable, 
and it has been found that Bi2Sr2Ca1Cu2O8-δ ·Bi2Sr2Ca2Cu3O10-δ 
are superconductors having a critical temperature of 
about 80 K and about 105 K, respectively, (H. Maeda, Y. 
Tanaka, M. Fukutomi, and T. Asano: Jpn. J. Appl. Phys., 
27, (1988) L209), Tl2Ba2Ca1Cu2O8-δ·Tl2Ba2Ca2Cu3O10-δ are 
superconductors having a critical temperature of about 
110 K and about 125 K, respectively, (Z. Z. Sheng and A. 
M. Hermann: Nature 332 (1988) 55), and Tl1Sr2Ca1Cu2O7-δ·Tl1Sr2Ca2Cu3O9-δ 
are superconductors having a critical 
temperature of about 75 K and about 100 K, respectively, 
(S. Matsuda, S. Takeuchi, A. Soeta, T. Suzuki, T. Kamo: 
Jpn. J. Appl. Phys., 27 (1988) 2062). Each of all the 
above superconductors has a superconducting phase having 
a critical temperature higher than a liquid nitrogen 
temperature, and since then, material development for 
improving characteristics of the materials have been 
continued in order to obtain materials having a high 
critical temperature, high chemical stability, and a 
single phase obtainable easily by synthesizing 
derivatives of which a part of composition is replaced 
with various elements. As for application technology operating at the 
liquid nitrogen temperature for utilizing most 
effectively feature of the above described high  
 
temperature superconducting materials, a conductor such 
as cables and coils used in a condition of electric 
resistance zero by making the materials a wire, and 
usages for thin film superconducting devices have been 
proposed. Especially, for application to energy related 
fields, development of oxide superconducting wire is an 
important technical point. Regarding to technology for
