<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to an improved cleaning method 
and system, and more particularly to a closed solvent 
cleaning method and system which virtually eliminates the 
mixture of the solvent with air throughout the cleaning 
operation. Eliminating air from the process allows complete 
recovery of the vapors by conventional condensing method, 
thereby controlling emissions to ambience surroundings. Cleaning operations are becoming more and more of a 
burden on industry because of the ever-stricter requirements, 
being made on the environmental disposition of compounds used 
in the cleaning operations and resulting effluents. Cleaning 
operations affected include those involving clothing, rugs 
and furnishings, as well as those of a more industrial nature 
such as involving the cleaning and degreasing of metals, 
ceramics, plastics and other materials. Solvent cleaning 
processes, those using a solvent to degrease and clean, are 
the most prevalent. There are two types of solvent cleaning 
processes: open and closed. Open systems are still the most 
commonly used, but their appeal is shrinking with increasing 
demands of environmental safety. Open systems include such 
approaches as solvent vapor degreasing, solvent ultrasonic 
cleaning, cold or hot solvent dipped and solvent spray 
systems. These systems suffer from a number of shortcomings, 
among the most important of which are the contamination of 
the environment and the cost of constantly replenishing the 
non-recoverable solvent. In addition, the cost of equipment  
 
to contain the vapor and to properly dispose of the vapor and 
liquid waste is becoming more and more formidable. The closed systems, so-called, attempt to combat these 
problems but with indifferent success. The loss of solvent 
as vapor and liquid still occurs even in a so-called closed 
system because the vapor escapes when the cleaned parts are 
removed and the parts carry off solvent which clings to their 
surfaces and resides in the pores of the material. Further, 
attempts to recover the solvent are expensive and less than 
totally successful. For even though the system is "closed" 
when the solvent is introduced to the closed chamber, it 
mixes with the air there. After the cleaning operation the 
solvent in liquid form can be easily separated from the air, 
but not so with solvent in vapor form. That requires a major 
effort. Even if the air and solvent are condensed, only a 
small amount of solvent can be recovered. Incineration is 
one technique for getting rid of solvent
</DESCRIPTION>
<CLAIMS>
A method of cleaning using a solvent in a closed 
circuit, comprising the steps of: placing the object to be 

cleaned in a chamber (52); subjecting the chamber to a 
negative gauge pressure to remove air and other 

non-condensible gases; introducing a gaseous solvent to the 
cleaning chamber; cleaning the object while maintaining an 

airless environment within the chamber (52); recovering and 
processing the solvent from the object and chamber within 

the closed circuit; and removing the cleaned object from 
the chamber; and maintaining a substantially airless 

environment in a holding chamber (78) for the solvent and in 
conduits interconnecting the holding chamber and the 

cleaning chamber; 
characterised by
 maintaining the holding 
chamber (78) at substantially less than atmospheric 

pressure; and allowing the introduction of the gaseous 
solvent to the cleaning chamber while the pressure in the 

cleaning chamber is less than the vapour pressure of the 
solvent in the holding chamber. 
A method according to claim 1 and further comprising 
increasing the pressure within the cleaning chamber (52) 

after the introduction of gaseous solvent so as to drive 
solvent and its contaminants back into the holding chamber.
