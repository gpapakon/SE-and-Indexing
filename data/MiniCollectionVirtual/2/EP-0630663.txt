<ABSTRACT>
In order to carrry out a two-stage fire 
extinguishing operation including a cooling fire 

extinguishing operation and an oxygen deficiency fire 
extinguishing operation using a fire extinguishing 

gas, a cylinder filled with a liquefied gas of carbon 
dioxide is used, and a firing pin unit for breaking a 

seal member of the chlinder, a retainer for 
maintaining the firing pin unit in a non-opereted 

state and a retainer operating device for 
automatically operating the retainer on the basis of 

stored temperature data are provided. The retainer is 
fixed at a head portion thereof by bolt screwed to the 

upper surface region of a fixing member, and leg 
portions of the retainer are fitted in an upper recess 

in a shaft to a lower end portion of which a pin is 
fixed. The retainer operating device consists of a 

retainer turning member provided with projections on 
one end portion thereof. These projections are 

positioned on the inner side of the two leg portions 
of the retainer, and the retainer operating device is 

turned when a spring of a shape memory metal contracts 
at a predetermined temperature, to cause the 

projections to open the leg portions of the retainer, 
and the pin to be driven.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an automatic 
injector for a gas fire extinguisher and a retainer 
device thereof. Various types of fire extinguishers have 
heretofore been produced. The known fire 
extinguishers include a gas fire extinguisher provided 
with a cylinder filled with a fire extinguishing gas, 
such as a flon gas or carbon dioxide in a liquefied 
state and adapted to be used by ejecting the gas as a 
fire extinguishing agent from the cylinder by manually 
breaking a seal member thereof. There is also a known 
fire extinguisher adapted to eject a powdered or water 
soluble fire extinguishing agent by a gas pressure. Since a gas is ejected by a manual operation when 
a gas fire extinguisher among these known fire 
extinguishers is used, it takes time to carry out a 
fire extinguishing operation. Regarding, especially, 
a gas fire extinguisher using a flon gas, the 
discontinuance of the uae of the same gas bas been 
decided under the international treaty for the  
 
improvement of the earth environment, so that it is 
necessary to develop a substitute therefor. When a 
fire extinguisher adapted to eject a powdered or water 
soluble fire extinguishing agent is used, the machines 
and tools, clothes and documents which are 
installed,stored or placed in a room suffer great 
damage due to the deposition of the fire extinguishing 
agent during a fire extinguishing operation. Accordingly, it is an object of the present 
invention to provide an automatic injector for a gas 
fire extinguisher, capable of improving the fire 
extinguishing performance by utilizing its two-stage 
fire extinguishing function consisting of the cooling 
fire extinguishing function based on the obtainment of 
a gas of a super-low temperature due to the 
vaporization latent heat occurring when a gas, such as 
carbon dioxide contained in a liquid state in a 
cylinder is ejected therefrom and gasified, and the 
oxygen deficiency fire extinguishing function based on 
the obtainment of an oxygen deficient condition in a 
room or storages due to the explosive expansion of a 
vaporization gas occurring in the mentioned manner; 
and capable of speeding up a fire extinguishing 
operation by carrying out the automatic ejection of a 
gas of the basis of stored temperature data. A further object of the present invention is to 
provide a high-performance automatic injector for a  
 
gas fire extinguisher, capable of carrying out a fire 
extinguishing operation speedily without soiling 
various kinds of equipment, documents, curios
