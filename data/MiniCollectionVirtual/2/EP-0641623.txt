<ABSTRACT>
A clamping device (1) serves to hold workpieces (2) and has a clamping jaw (6) which is adjustable in the clamping direction. In addition, the clamping device includes a rail-shaped support part (8) which has fastening points (9) for connecting to a machine table (10) or the like. A clamping bracket (7) is mounted in the clamping jaw inside an inner cavity (13) running obliquely in the clamping direction. The clamping bracket (7) is of roughly U-shaped design and has at its free ends projections for reaching under side flanges of the roughly T-shaped support part (8). The clamping jaw (6) can be displaced in the clamping direction and clamped via the clamping bracket (7) and a clamping screw (16) acting on it. The clamping jaw overlaps the support part (8) and is guided on the underside on the machine table (10) or the like.

Clamping device (1) for holding workpieces (2) with
at least one clamping jaw (6) which can be adjusted in

the clamping direction and which is thereby displaceably
and fixedly connected to a supporting part (8), whereby

this supporting part (8) comprises mounting points (9)
for connecting to a supporting plate, e.g. a drilling

screen (5), or to a machine table (10) or the like base
plate, characterised in that the supporting part (8) is

formed in the shape of a rail, that the clamping jaw (6)
engages over the rail-shaped supporting part (8) on both

sides and that clamping jaw side parts (11) can be
braced in the clamping position with their undersides

(12) against the supporting plate or the machine table
(10) or the like or against an intermediate layer plate

(27) which is present on the supporting plate or the
machine table (10) or the like.
Clamping device according to claim 1, characterised
in that interlocking guides which are oriented in the

clamping direction are provided at the clamping jaw (6)
and at the supporting part (8).
Clamping device according to claim 1 or 2,
characterised in that the rail-shaped supporting part

(8) is approximately formed T-shaped in its cross
section.
Clamping device according to one of claims 1 to 3,
characterised in that the clamping jaw (6) is connected

to an adjustable clamping clip (7) which spans the
supporting part (8) laterally in an interlocking manner,

which is arranged in an oblique way in the clamping
direction, and that the clamping jaw side parts (11) can

be braced by displacing the clamping clip (7) relative 
to the clamping jaw (6) against the supporting plate or

the machine table (10) or the like.
Clamping device according to claim 4, characterised
in that the clamping clip (7) is approximately U-shaped

with gripping projections (14) which are located at its
free ends and point towards one another.
Clamping device according to one of claims 1 to 5,
characterised in that the clamping jaw (6) for the

workpiece (2) to be clamped comprises a support ledge
(22), the height of which is given by the side parts

(11) which lie on the supporting plate, the machine
table (10) or the like.
Clamping device according to claim 5 or 6,
characterised in that the gripping projections (14) of

the clamping clip (7) and the side flanks of the
supporting part (8) which are gripped from underneath by

these comprise interlocking locating profiles (15).
Clamping device according to one of claims 1 to 7,
characterised in that the supporting part (8) comprises

at least one bore (9) for a mounting screw as mounting
point(s).
Clamping device according to one of claims 1 to 8,
characterised in that the supporting part (8) has a

smaller width than the clamping jaw (6) and that the
length of the supporting part (8) preferably corresponds

approximately to that of the lamping jaw (6).
Clamping device according to one of claims 4 to 9,
characterised in that the clamping jaw (6) comprises an

inner cavity (13) which is open toward the supporting
part (8) for partially receiving the clamping clip (7),

that this inner cavity is arranged in the clamping 
direction in an oblique way with its end facing the

supporting part (8) nearer to the front part of the
clamping jaw, and that the clamping clip (7) is

connected to the clamping jaw (6) via a clamping screw
(16) which is supported on an oblique face (18) of the

clamping jaw (6) which is approximately at a right angle
to the course of the clamping clip.
Clamping device according to claim 10,
characterised in that the inner cavity (13) of the

clamping jaw (6) is larger in the clamping direction
than the clamping clip (7) arranged therein, and that a

longitudinal hole (17) is provided for the passage of
the clamping screw (16) through the clamping jaw (6),

which is oriented in the clamping direction.
Clamping device according to claim 10 or 11,
characterised in that the clamping screw (16) engages

the U-shaped connecting bar of the clamping clip (7) and
bears against the clamping jaw (6) at the outside, in

particular at its oblique face (18).
Clamping device according to one of claims 1 to 12,
characterised in that it forms a clamping system in

connection with reference beams (3) which serve as
counter stops.
Clamping device according to one of claims 4 to 13,

characterised in that the clamping clip (7) in the
clamping jaw (6) is acted upon with pressure

approximately in the clamping feeding direction of the
clamping jaw at the side thereof, and that in particular

at least one compression spring (20) or a flexible
pressure piece or the like is provided for this for the

clamping clip in a transverse direction to the inner
cavity (13). 
Clamping device according to one of claims 1 to 13,
characterised in that a drawing-down apparatus (24)

preferably with an approximately ledge-shaped drawing-down
element (25), which is in a receiving slot, is

provided at the clamping face (23) of the clamping jaw
(6).
Clamping device according to one of claims 6 to 15,
characterised in that the receiver slot which is

provided in the clamping jaw (6) comprises an exit
direction at the clamping face (18) which is oblique

with regard to the workpiece holder (22), that a
clearance is provided in the swivel-down direction of

the drawing-down element (25) next thereto, at least for
receiving the parts of the drawing-down element (25)

which project in their non-loaded position over the
clamping face of the clamping jaw, and that the slot

width in the region of the clamping face for forming the
clearance for movement for the end of the drawing-down

element at the clamping face side is larger than in the
rearward bearing region.
