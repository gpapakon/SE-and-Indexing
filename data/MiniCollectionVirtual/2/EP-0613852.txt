<ABSTRACT>
Between a floor-side underframe 2 and a top table platform 3, a scissor-type lifting table has at least one pair of scissor arms 5, 6; 7, 8 which are connected to one another in a cross joint 4. In opposite end areas 14, 15; 16, 17, the scissor arms 5, 6; 7, 8 are in each case supported at one end in a fixed position at a swivel bearing 18, 19 and at the other end via a loose bearing 20, 21 on the underframe 2 and the table platform 3 respectively. In an initial position close to the underframe 2, an expanding lever 40 located on the outer piston-rod end 39 of a piston/cylinder unit 23, 24 and having a pressure roller 44; 144 reaches in the area of at least one scissor arm 6, 8 under the table platform 3 in order to initiate an initial stroke. The expanding lever 40 is designed as a lifting rocker 42 located between respective inner legs 25', 26'; 27', 28' of at least one of the scissor-arm pairs 5, 6; 7, 8. The lifting rocker 42, at least at one end, has a connecting part 43; 43' coaxial to the cross joint 4 and has at the other end the pressure roller 44 and, axially parallel between the cross joint 4 and the pressure-roller axis 45, a piston-rod articulation 38 located in the initial position above the centre longitudinal plane 35 of the piston/cylinder unit 23; 24.

A scissor-type lifting table comprising between a bottom frame (2) which is on the 
floor side and an upper table top (3) at least one pair of scissor arms (5, 6; 7, 8) connected 

to one another in a universal joint (4) and which, in oppositely disposed end portions (14, 
15; 16, 17) are in each case rigidly connected at one end to a pivot bearing (18, 19) and 

at the other via a loose bearing (20, 21) on the bottom frame (2) or on the table top (3), 
whereby this starting position which is disposed close to the bottom frame is in the region 

of at least one scissor arm (6, 8) subject to an expanding lever (40) with a pressure roller 
(44; 144) engaging underneath it in order to initiate a starting travel of the table top (3), 

the expanding lever (40) being disposed at the outer end (39) of the piston rod of a 
piston/cylinder unit (23, 24), characterised in that the expanding lever (40) is constructed 

as a lifting and swinging arm (42) disposed between respective inner members (25', 26'; 
27', 28') of at least one of the pairs of scissor arms (5, 6; 7, 8) and which has at least at 

one end a connecting part (43, 43') coaxial with the universal joint (4) and which has at 
the other the pressure roller (44) and axially parallel between the universal joint (4) and 

the spindle (45) of the pressure roller a piston rod articulation (38) which, in the lowered 
position, is disposed above the median longitudinal plane (35) of the piston/cylinder unit 

(23; 24). 
A scissor type lifting table according to claim 1, characterised in that via a bracing 
arrangement (31, 32) which fixes the cylinder (33, 34) of the piston/cylinder unit (23, 24) 

in the end part close to the pivot bearing (18, 19) of the scissor arm (6, 8), the lifting 
swinging arm (42) on the one hand, the piston rod articulation (38) on the other and the 

thrust roller (44) constitutes an operative connection with the table top (3) and in that this 
latter can be moved into an extreme lifted position by only one piston/cylinder unit (23, 

24) which, in every phase of lifting (H; H'; H''), has a substantially constant internal 
cylinder pressure, only one such unit (23, 24) being provided per pair of scissor arms (5, 

6; 7, 8) and engaging under the table top (3).  
 
A scissor type lifting table according to claim 1 or 2, characterised in that the 
lifting swinging arm (42) has a shaped part (47, 47') which limits the pivot range in a first 

lifting phase (H') via an abutment member (46, 46') braced in the region of whichever is 
the inner arm (25', 26'). 
A scissor type lifting table according to one of claims 1 to 3, characterised in that 
the table top (3) comprising a supporting area (48) on the under side of the table top has 

a pressure roller (44) disposed on the lifting swinging arm (42) so engaging under it that 
a bracing engagement is formed in a first lifting phase (H') bounded by the inward pivoting 

of the abutment member (46, 46') into the shaped part (47, 47'). 
A scissor type lifting table according to one of claims 1 to 4, characterised in that 
the scissor arm (6) connected by a loose bearing (20) to the table top (3) is connected to 

the table top (3) via an element (51) engaging under the roller and the length (50) of 
which is attuned to the pivoting part of the lifting swinging arm (42). 
A scissor type lifting table according to one of claims 1 to 5, characterised in that 
the cylinder (33, 34) of the piston/cylinder unit (23, 24) has in the region of the respective 

pivot bearing (19, 19') a bracing (53, 53') which is spaced apart from the longitudinal 
central plane (35, 35') thereof. 
A scissor type lifting table according to one of claims 1 to 6, characterised in that 
the lifting swinging arm (42) is constructed as a transversely reinforced double member
