<ABSTRACT>
Two machine parts (1, 4) are movably guided with respect to each other. The first machine part (1) is coupled to a guide (3) and the second machine part (4) is coupled to a linear rolling guiding bearing (8) capable of rolling on the guide (3). In order to suppress vibrations to a large extent, a damping unit (7) is either integrated in the rolling bearing (13) capable of rolling on the guide (3) or is separately incorporated between the machine part (4) and the linear rolling guiding bearing (7). The damping unit (7) has two damping parts (2, 3, 22, 25). The first damping part (5a, b, c, 25a, b, c) is coupled to the machine table (4), whereas the damping part (2, 22) is coupled to the rolling bearing (13, 8) capable of rolling on the guide (3). Both damping parts (2, 5a, b, c, 22, 25a, b, c) nest as cylinders into each other and form therebetween (section shown) a ring-shaped damping gap (6a, b, c) with two halves (20, 21) of equal size in which the damping medium is arranged in such a way that it cannot be lost during operation. No compensating space is required. The damping chambers are sealed and communicate with each other in such a way that a large damping force may be generated in all transverse directions, or their effective direction may be easily adjusted during operation. The ease of movement between both machine parts (1, 4) is not affected.

Damping device for mutually guided displaceable machine elements (1, 4) 
comprising a first machine element (1) connected to a guide (3) and a second 

machine element (4) connected to a rolling bearing (8) which is displaceable by 
rolling on the guide (3), two damping elements (2, 5; 22, 25) being disposed for 

limited relative displacement in a damping carriage (7), the first of which 
damping elements (2; 22) is connected to said rolling bearing (8) or to a 

specially provided rolling bearing (13) which is likewise displaceable by rolling 
on the guide (3), while the second damping element (5; 25) is connected to the 

second machine element (4), and a damping gap (6a, 6b, 6c; 26a, 26b, 26c) in 
which a free-flowing damping medium is arranged so as to be safe against loss 

during operation is formed between the two damping elements (2, 5; 22, 25), 

characterized in that
 the second damping element (5;25) is completely 
surrounded by two halves (20, 21) of equal content of the round about 

extending damping gap (6a, 6b, 6c; 26a, 26b, 26c), the first damping element 
(2; 22) comprises at least two bores (12; 100a, 100b, 100c) and the second 

damping element (5; 25) comprises the same number of shafts (5a, 5b, 5c; 25a, 
25b, 25c) which are inserted into said bores (12; 100a, 100b, 100c), and the 

damping gap (6a, 6b, 6c; 26a, 26b, 26c) which is sealed at both ends by elastic 
transverse seals (11; 111) is formed between each shaft (5a, 5b, 5c; 25a, 25b, 

25c) and the respective bore (12; 100a, 100b, 100c). 
Damping device according to Claim 1, 
characterized in that
 the two halves 
(20, 21) of equal content of the damping gap (6a, 6b, 6c; 26a, 26b, 26c) are 

separated by longitudinal seals (10; 110).  
 
Damping device according to Claim 2, 
characterized in that
 the position of 
the two halves (20, 21) of the damping gap can be adjusted by rotating the shaft 

(5; 25), for example by means of a wrench applied to its front end (16). 
Damping device according to Claim 1, 
characterized in that
 the damping 
gap (6; 26) situated between the two damping elements ( 2, 5; 22, 25) has a 

value ranging from a few micrometers to 1/10 mm. 
Damping device according to Claim 1, 
characterized in that
 the elastic seals 
configured as transverse seals (11; 111) are arranged in corresponding grooves 

of the shafts or in bores. 
Damping device according to Claim 2, 
characterized in that
 communicating 
channels (66) are arranged between the transverse seals (11; 111) and the 

longitudinal seals (10; 110) on both ends. 
Damping device according to Claim 1, 
characterized in that
 the damping 
gaps (6a, 6b, 6c; 26a, 26b, 26c) are connected to channels (52, 101, 102) that 

serve at the same time as filling and dearating channels for the damping liquid 
while being sealed in leak-proof manner at both ends by sealing screws (60, 

103). 
Damping device according to one of the Claims 1 to 7, 
characterized in that
 
the transverse seals (11; 111) are configured as sealing rings. 
Damping device according to one of the Claims 1 to 8,
