<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to an alpine ski binding component comprising the following parts: a base (3), a body (2), a jaw (4) for holding the boot, and an energy spring (15) housed inside the body. The component is characterised in that the supporting plate (26) can move for a rolling movement, and in that connection means (40, 50, 54, 58) sensitive to the rolling movements of the supporting plate connect the supporting plate to at least one of the movable parts of the binding component, so as to reduce the opposing force which the boot must overcome in order to be released laterally by the jaw, and then to cause the jaw to swing freely beyond a rolling movement of given amplitude produced by the supporting plate.

<CLAIMS>
Alpine ski binding element comprising the following 
members: 


a base (3) connected to the ski; 
a body (2) mounted on the base; 
a boot retention jaw (4) borne by the body; 
the jaw comprising two lateral boot retention wings and 
a sole clamp for vertical retention; 
an energy spring (15) housed in the body for 
elastically opposing the opening movements of the jaw in 

response to the forces from the boot; 
a movable support plate (26) on which the sole of the 
boot rests, 
 
   characterized in that the support plate (26) is movable 

about a longitudinal axis (28), that the body (2) is connected 
to the base (3) by a pivot (18), that a removable latch (54) 

connects the base (3) and the body (2), and that linkage means 
(40, 50, 54, 58) sensitive to the rolling movements of the 

support plate lower the resistance force which the spring 
opposes to the opening movements of the jaw and control the 

displacement of the latch at the same time. 
Element according to claim 1, characterized in that 
the linking means comprise a tipping element (58) of which an 

arm (57) is connected to the support plate (26) by a pusher 
(50) guided for a longitudinal translational movement, the 

tipping element further being journaled about a horizontal 
axis (59) borne by the body. 
Element according to claim 2, characterized in that 
the removable latch (54) is actuated by the pusher (50).  

 
Element according to claim 3, characterized in that 
the removable latch (54) is guided with respect to the body, 

and that it transmits the movement of the pusher (50) to the 
arm (57) of the tipping element (58). 
Element according to claim 4, characterized in that 
the pivot (18) is affixedly connected to the body (2), that 

it has a central recess (24) in which the tipping element (58) 
is partially housed, demarcated by a wall crossed right 

through by the latch (54). 
Element according to claim 5, characterized in that 
the latch (54) is partially housed in a recess (66) of the 

guide wall of the pivot (18). 
Element according to claim 6, characterized in that 
the latch (54) has the shape of an anchor whose body (55) 

actuates the tipping element (58), and whose incurved arm (53) 
provides a support to the pusher (50). 
Element according to claim 2, characterized in that 
the linking means comprise a tipping element (40) journaled 

about a transverse axis (41), with two lugs (43, 44) engaged 
beneath the lateral edges of the support plate (26) and a 

vertical arm (45) constituting a support for the pusher (50).
