<ABSTRACT>
A steel shaft is disposed in a forging metallic die, 
and aluminum alloy powder or its preliminarily formed body is 

charged in the metallic die around the steel shaft. The 
aluminum alloy powder or its preliminarily formed body is 

forged so that a rotor of aluminum powder alloy is 
manufactured, and at the same time, the rotor is connected and 

fixed to the shaft.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method of 
manufacturing a rotor made of aluminum powder alloy having a 
steel shaft used for an air compressor and the like. The weight of a rotor used for a compressor and the 
like is required to be low, and the mechanical strength thereof 
is required to be high. Therefore, a rotor made of aluminum 
powder alloy is used, which is manufactured from aluminum alloy 
powder by means of powder metallurgy. That is, aluminum alloy 
powder made by the quenching solidification method is used, and 
solidified by means of sintering, forging or the like so as to 
manufacture a rotor made of aluminum powder alloy. The thus manufactured rotor made of aluminum powder 
alloy is connected and fixed by various methods to a steel 
shaft which has been differently made. Examples of commonly 
used connecting methods are: a hot upsetting method in which a 
rotor, the size of which is a little larger than a 
predetermined one, is disposed around a shaft in a metallic 
die, and then the rotor is compressed at a raised temperature 
so that the rotor can be connected and fixed to the shaft; a 
press-fitting method in which the inner circumferential surface 
of a rotor and the outer circumferential surface of a shaft are 
subjected to serration processing, and then the shaft is  
 
mechanically fitted onto the inner circumferential surface of 
the rotor so that the shaft is fixed to the rotor; and a 
shrinkage fitting method in which a heated rotor is fitted to 
a shaft and then cooled so that the rotor and shaft are 
connected and fixed to each other by using a difference between 
the thermal expansion coefficients. In the conventional connecting methods described above, 
the rotor made of aluminum powder alloy and the steel shaft are 
differently manufactured, and further not only the shaft but 
also the inner circumferential surface of the rotor must be 
machined so that the size and configuration can be 
appropriately adjusted. Accordingly, the conventional 
connecting methods are disadvantageous in that the number of 
manufacturing processes is increased and the cost is high. 
Especially, in the case of the press-fitting method, the 
complicated serration processing is required, and the serration 
processing is one of the main reasons of high cost. Furthermore, according to the conventional connecting 
methods, it is difficult to completely connect the aluminum 
powder alloy rotor with the steel shaft, and a gap tends to be 
formed on a connection interface between the rotor and the 
ste
