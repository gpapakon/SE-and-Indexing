<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to an interchangeable, tiltable, stackable transport container (1) for differently flowable and/or pourable materials, such as rubble, refuse and the like. A flap (18) and/or door closes one end face (13) of the transport container (1) and is attached so as to be pivotable and to rest flush against the bottom (6) of the transport container (1). The purpose of the invention is to design the transport container (1) in such a way that effective disposal of a waste component is always possible using said container in each case and different waste components can be received separately yet transported together. For this purpose, a flap (4) is also provided on the opposite, second end face (3), which flap can only be opened into the interior (2) of the transport container (1). Provided on the outer surface of the bottom (6) of the transport container (1) are standing rails (7), between which a tilting bearing (19) is provided at the ends of said rails in the region of the first end face (3).

<CLAIMS>
Exchangeable, tiltable, stackable transport container for differently flowable 
and/or dumpable material like rumble, waste and the like with a flap (4) closing a 

first front side (3) of the transport container and/or door, bounding flush against 
the bottom (6) of the transport container and with stationary rails at the outer 

surface of the bottom of the transport container, between which a tilting bearing 
(19) is provided for,
characterized thereby
 
that also at the opposite second
 front side (13) a flap (18) is provided for which 
can only be opened towards the interior space (2) of the transport container (1), 

that the front sides (3, 13) have borderings, that in the area of these borderings 
(15) of the front sides (3 and 13) and the side areas (10) of the transport 

container (1) coupling elements (16, 17) are provided for coupling with a further 
transport container and that the tilting bearing (19) provided for between the 

stationary rails (7) is provided for at the ends of the stationary rails (7) in the 
area of the first front side (3). 
Transport container according to claim 1, 
characterized thereby
, that one 
centering pivot (11) each is provided for in the middle at the top edge (9) of each 

side area (10) which can be brought in engagement with a silo pick-up of a BTE 
- tipping container vehicle. 
Transport container according to claim 1 and 2, 
characterized thereby
, that at 
the side areas (10) of the transport container (1) close to its front sides (3 

respectively 13) one further pair of centering pivots (12) each is provided for, 
which can be brought in engagement with a tipping container vehicle. 
Transport container according to claim 1 to 3, 
characterized thereby
, that it is 
equipped with a rope slide off tipping device. 
Transport container according to claim 1 and 4, 
characterized thereby
, that it is 
equipped with a cover (14).  

 
Transport container according to claim 5, 
characterized thereby
, that the cover 
(14) is a folding cover. 
Transport container according to claim 1 and 6, 
characterized thereby
, that at 
the ends (20) of the stationary rails (7) in the area of the second front side (13) 

of the transport container (1) a rope pick-up (21) is provided for.
