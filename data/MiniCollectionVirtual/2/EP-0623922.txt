<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention generally relates to
an optical information
recording and reproducing apparatus having a laser output control device that
records and
reproduces information onto and from an optical
information recording medium, and it more particularly
relates to a device for controlling output power of a
semiconductor laser.Semiconductor lasers provide light outputs that vary
with changes in temperature and in luminous energy. On
the other hand, optical information recording and
reproducing apparatus provides automatic power control
(hereinafter referred to as APC) of laser light utilized
therein, because they require constant laser light output
for recording and reproducing information in an uniform
condition. Examples of the prior techniques relating to
such automatic control of laser light output are
disclosed in Japanese Patent Laid-open Publication Nos.
SHO 50-23902 and 51-29821, Japanese Patent Publication
Nos. HEI Nos. 2-47015 and 5-6260, and Japanese Patent 
Laid-open Publication No. HEI 4-330646.For example, in an optical information recording and
reproducing apparatus as shown in Fig. 4, the peripheral
light component 5 of forward radiated light output from a
semiconductor laser chip 1 is eliminated via a
collimating lens 3, so that only the non-peripheral light
component 2. i.e., light component in and around the
center of the forward radiated light enters the
collimating lens 3 to be converted into a collimated
light beam and then enters a beam splitter 4. The non-peripheral
light component 2 is divided into transmitted
light 6 and reflected light 7 by the beam splitter 4.
The transmitted light 6 is converged by a converging lens
8 and directed onto an information recording medium 9 as
a very minute laser light spot 10 to be utilized for
effecting information recording or reproducing as needed.
The reflected light 7 from the beam splitter 4 enters a
light detection element 15.Reflected light from the information recording
medium 9 goes back the same path that the transmitted
light 6 took to reach the recording medium 9. The
reflected light is converted via the converging lens 8
into a collimated beam, which is then directed to the
beam splitter 4. Light transmitted through the beam
splitter 4 is then directed onto the semiconductor chip 1
as return light, while light 11 reflected by the beam 
splitter 4 is received by a light detection element 13
via light receiving lenses 12. Thus, information signal,
focus controlling signal and tracking controlling signal
are derived from the light
