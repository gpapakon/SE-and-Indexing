<ABSTRACT>
An incandescent lamp which is operable at about 200-275V 
is obtainable by enclosing a filling composition consisting of 

about 80-95% by volume of krypton gas and about 5-20% by 
volume of nitrogen gas in a glass envelope (1) bearing a 

tungsten filament (2) and an inner volume of about 
0.2-1.2ml/operating wattage in an amount of about 0.7-0.9ml/ml 

of the inner volume. The incandescent lamp exhibits 
satisfactory luminous characteristics and an extended life 

expectancy without causing arc discharge even when operated at 
a voltage of about 200-275V. Thus a lighting device which 

comprises such an incandescent lamp as the luminous source and 
a power source capable of energizing it at a voltage of about 

200-275V is very useful in general and special illumination.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to an incandescent lamp and 
a lighting device with such a lamp, in particular, to an incandescent lamp operable 
at an elevated voltage which encloses a filling composition 
consisting of krypton gas and nitrogen gas. Generally, the elevation of filament temperature in 
incandescent lamps improves their luminous efficiency. Such an 
elevation however accelerates the vaporization of tungsten and 
the vaporized tungsten attaches and blackens on the inside 
surface of glass envelope to reduce luminous efficiency and 
life expectancy. To suppress the vaporization of tungsten, 
incandescent lamps enclose inert gas such as nitrogen gas 
and/or rare gas, for example, argon gas, krypton gas and xenon 
gas. It is well known that, in this case, the larger the 
molecular or atomic weight of the enclosed inert or rare gas, 
the heat loss on glass envelope becomes much less, thus enabling 
an elevated filament temperature. Also is known that krypton gas has a relatively large 
atomic weight among these inert or rare gases and exhibits 
satisfactory luminous characteristics and extended life expectancy  
 
when enclosed in incandescent lamps. Krypton however has 
the disadvantage that when excessively enclosed in glass 
envelope, its low ionization potential is causative of switch-on 
arc discharge which may accelerate the burnout of filament, 
therefore, in conventional krypton lamps, about 5-10% by volume 
of nitrogen gas is used in combination to suppress arc discharge 
and the operating voltage is set around that of standard 
ac line, in particular, 100-110V. Although, of course, the use 
of an elevated nitrogen gas content and other one or more rare 
gases with a higher ionization potential and/or better luminous 
characteristics such as argon gas and xenon gas has been 
proposed, these proposals are effective in improving arc 
starting voltage but have the disadvantage that they hinder the 
elicitation of superior luminous characteristics inherent to 
krypton gas and low-cost production of incandescent lamps. Thus, there have been available no low-cost incandescent 
lamps which enclose about 80-95% by volume of krypton 
gas to elicit its inherent desirable properties but hardly 
cause arc discharge when operated at a relatively high voltage, 
in particular, about 200-275V. "Lamps and Lighting" by S.T. Henderson and A.M. Marsden (Pages 149 to 
153) discloses various gas compositions for discharge and incandescent lamp 
fillings. Amongst others, the following filling compositions are
