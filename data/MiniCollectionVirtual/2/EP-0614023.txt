<ABSTRACT>
A rotor for a six-pole electromagnetic clutch 
includes an outer pole ring 41 and an axially facing 

disc 40. The disc 40 is formed with two 
circumferentially extending and radially spaced rows of 

circumferentially spaced slots 54, there being short 
circumferentially extending bridges 55 between adjacent 

slots in each row. To strengthen the bridges 55 
against failure under high load and heavy wear 

conditions, a stainless steel reinforcing ring 58 is 
brazed to the outer pole ring 41 and the disc 40 and 

transmits torque between the two. The outer edge of 
the disc 40 thus may be spaced radially inwardly from 

the outer pole ring 41 to establish an annular air gap 
66 which coacts with the two rows of slots 54 to enable 

the rotor to possess the requisite magnetic 
characteristics to function in a six-pole clutch.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a rotor for an electromagnetic 
coupling such as an electromagnetic clutch or 
brake. Rotors of the same general type of that of the 
present invention are disclosed in Booth et al United 
States Patent 5,036,964 and Brown et al United States 
Patent 5,125,255. The Booth et al patent also discloses 
one version of an electromagnetic clutch with which the 
rotor may be used. A clutch rotor is made of low magnetic reluctance 
material and typically includes an inner hub, an axially 
facing disc formed integrally with and projecting radially 
outwardly from the hub, and an outer pole ring or 
flange at the outer periphery of the disc. The outer 
flange either defines or supports a pulley which coacts 
with a belt for driving the rotor. In the rotor disclosed 
in the Booth et al patent, the outer flange is 
brazed, welded or otherwise secured to the outer periphery 
of the disc while, in the rotor disclosed in the 
Brown et al patent, the outer flange is formed integrally 
with the outer periphery of the disc. The electromagnetic clutch disclosed in the Booth et 
al clutch is a six-pole clutch which is capable of 
developing relatively high torque even though the clutch 
is comparatively compact in a radial direction. The 
rotor disclosed in the Brown et al patent also is for use 
with a six-pole clutch. Typically, a rotor for a six-pole 
clutch is made by forming three circumferentially 
extending and radially spaced rows of circumferentially 
spaced slots through the disc of the rotor, there being 
relative narrow connecting bridges between the slots of 
each row. The slots form air gaps of high magnetic 
reluctance in the disc and, when the rotor includes three 
radially spaced rings of air gaps, the rotor possesses 
the necessary magnetic characteristics to cause the 
clutch to be a high torque six-pole clutch.  
 A rotor with three radially spaced rows of 
circumferentially spaced slots functions adequately in 
many applications of the clutch. In certain high 
inertia applications, however, such as where the clutch 
is being used to drive an engine cooling fan of large 
diameter, the rotor is subjected to high bending forces 
and to high wear. Under such conditions, the 
comparatively weak bridges between the slots tend to 
shear and produce failure of the rotor. The general aim of the present invention is to 
reinforce a rotor of the above general type in such a 
manner as to strengthen the bridges between the slots 
and prevent premature failure of the rotor while 
maintainin

A rotor for an electromagnetic coupling, said 
rotor comprising first and second annular members (41, 

35) made of material having low magnetic reluctance, 
said first annular member (41) having an annular pocket 

defined by an axially facing wall (60) having an outer 
margin and by a radially inwardly facing wall (61), 

said radially inwardly facing wall (61) being defined 
by the inner surface of an annular flange (62) 

projecting axially from the outer margin of said 
axially facing wall (60) and having an axially facing 

end (63), said second annular member (35) comprising a 
hub (39) located within said first annular member (41)

facing working face and having an oppositely facing 
non-working face, at least one circumferentially
