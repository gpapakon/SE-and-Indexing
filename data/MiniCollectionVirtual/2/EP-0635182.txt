<ABSTRACT>
An electronic security system includes an electronic lock mechanism and an electronic key (104a) each of which is provided with a microprocessor controller (CPU) and a memory (502) storing data including an ID code and encryption key codes. The lock microprocessor may either change ID codes stored in its memory or encrypt a seed number to be used for determining access to the lock. The key can only be used to access the lock (301a) either once or for a limited number of successive times, and must thereafter be reprogrammed by a host computer (910) to be loaded with either the proper ID code or the appropriate encryption key code for that lock. The electronic lock operates a solenoid which retracts a bolt-blocking mechanism that prevents the unlocking of the bolt even when a key having the correct mechanical key cuts is inserted into the lock. Power for operating the electronic lock as well as the solenoid is provided by a power supply within the key. In a preferred embodiment the key unit is composed of a handheld computer and key module interface.

<DESCRIPTION>
This application is a continuation-in-part of
application serial no. 522,017 filed May 11, 1990, now
U.S. Patent No. 5,140,317.This invention relates generally to electronic
security systems, and more particularly to electronic
security systems for money-containing devices such as
pay telephones, vending machines, bill changers or the
like, which must be periodically accessed by a
collector in order to retrieve the funds accumulated in
the device.Typically, the collection of money from coin or
currency operated devices such as pay telephones,
transit system fare card machines or the like is a
costly and burdensome operation. For instance, a
company may own tens or even hundreds of thousands of
pay telephones for which tens or hundreds of thousands
of keys must be kept in order to prevent the loss of a
key from requiring the changing of locks on thousands
of devices which would operate with the lost key.Another problem involved with the collection of
funds from currency operated devices is the possibility
of fraud or theft by a collector. Typically, a
collector should remove a locked coin box from the 
device and replace it with an empty lock box to which he
does not have access. However, it is possible that a
removed coin box will not be replaced with another lock box
but rather will be replaced with an unlocked receptacle
which can be later removed by that collector before turning
in his key at the end of the collection shift.Yet another cost involved in the collection process is
the sheer manpower required for the task of distributing,
collecting, and keeping track of many thousands of keys on a
daily basis.Although electronic security systems are known and have
been used for various purposes, see e.g. U.S. Patents
4,789,859, 4,738,334, 4,697,171, 4,438,426, applicants are
unaware of any which specifically address the problems,
noted above.US 4,829,296 describes an electronic lock system which
comprises an access device and a receiver. The access
device stores a list of receiver ID codes and corresponding
access codes. The receiver stores a single unique ID code
and a single unique access code. Upon insertion of the
access device into a particular receiver, the receiver
transmits the stored unique ID code to the inserted access
device. The access device looks up the receiver ID code and
transmits the correspondingly stored access code to the
receiver. The receiver compares the received access code
with the stored unique access code and upon a match, the
receiver grants access to the access device.WO
