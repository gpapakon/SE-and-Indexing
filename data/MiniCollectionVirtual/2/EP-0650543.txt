<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to the production of objects by suction-moulding pulp mass so as to form blanks or preforms (46) of at least approximately the same shape as the finished objects, after which the blanks or preforms are dried completely or partly and then subjected to finishing treatment so as to produce the final object. The new feature consists in that a number of blanks or preforms are moulded together in the form of an integral body with the blanks or preforms being mutually connected by bridge elements having such a mechanical strength that the integral body can be conveyed without being deformed to a number of work stations adapted each to perform its own finishing operation on each of the blanks or preforms (46) constituting part of the integral body, after which the finished objects are liberated by disrupting the securing connection to the bridge system.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method for the 
continuous production of objects from pulp material, said 
method being of the kind set forth in the preamble of claim 
1. In the present connection, the term "pulp material" 
is to be understood as applying to a fiber-containing pulp 
mass, that may also contain or consist of waste paper. In the continuous mass production of objects from 
pulp material it is known to use a moulding machine with a 
rotating mould carrier, on the periphery of which suction 
moulds are placed side by side, said moulds being periodically 
immersed in a pulp mass during the rotation of the 
mould carrier, so that a layer of pulp mass can be deposited 
on the suction moulds by applying suction to them during 
their passage through the pulp mass. When the moulds subsequently 
again are lifted free of the pulp mass, the moist 
blanks or preforms thus produced are removed from the suction 
mould, partly by blowing air through the latter, partly by 
aspirating the blanks or preforms onto corresponding counter-moulds 
placed on the periphery of a pressing rotor, the 
axis of which is parallel to the axis of the mould carrier, 
and facing the latter. From this latter rotor, the blanks or preforms are 
transferred to supporting and conveying means adapted to 
convey the blanks or preforms having been transferred through 
a drying apparatus. It is not possible with suction-moulding 
wet material to produce objects immediately having their 
precise final shape. Hence, with this in itself rational 
method of production, it is normally necessary to carry out 
a subsequent finishing treatment of each individual dried  
 
blank or preform, e.g. by a post-pressing operation, an 
edge-cutting operation, imprinting and the like. In automatically operating plants, in the present 
connection being the rule rather than the exception, if an 
economically justifiable production is to be achieved, the 
conveying of the blanks or preforms towards and between the 
individual work stations and the processing of the blanks 
or preforms in the latter must be performed individually at 
the production rate. This has especially shown itself to be 
a disadvantage, when the suction-moulding method is to be 
utilized in a rational manner, not only for the mass production 
of objects with relatively large surfaces, such as 
the well-known egg trays, but also for the production of 
small objects, e.g. planting pots of the kind used by gardeners 
for planting-out operations, as conveying and processing

Method for the continous production of objects 
from a pulp material, said method comprising the steps of 


a) moulding blanks or preforms of at least approximately 
the same shape as the finished objects by aspirating 

pulp mass against a liquid-permeable mould surface, 
b) removal from the moulding surface and complete or 
partial drying of the blanks or preforms thus produced, and 
c) final finishing processing of the completely or 
partially dried blanks or preforms so as to produce the 

final objects, 
 
   
characterized
 in
 
   d) that a combination of a plurality of blanks or 

preforms, and elements providing a bridge system interconnecting 
said blanks or preforms are moulded together as an 

integral body having a mechanical strength and a shape sufficient 
to allow it after having been removed from the mould 

surface and dried, to be conveyed in a positive manner by 
means of suitable conveying means through a processing line 

consisting of a number of work stations sequentially situated 
in the direction of conveying, each work station being adapted 

to perform its own finishing operation on the blanks or 
preforms constituting parts of each integral body, and to 

subsequently liberate the blanks or preforms from the bridge 
system interconnecting them and to remove the blanks or 

preforms and the bridge system elements from the processing 
line. 
Method according to claim 1, 
characterized
 in 
that the integral body is given such a shape that it with a 

view to being conveyed can rest on a substantially plane 
and continous conveying surface or carried "floating" by 

suitable support means without deformation being caused to 
itself or the individual blanks or preforms.  

 
Method according to claim 1, 
characterized
 in 
that for being conveyable in a positive manner, the integral 

body is moulded with laterally protruding tabs adapted to be 
gripped or engaged by conveying means in the form of gripping 

means. 
Method according to any one or any of the claims 
1-3, 
characterized
 in that at least some of the bridges 
interconnecting the blanks or preforms are given the shape 

of a continous, grid-like object. 
Plant for the continous production of objects 

from pulp material while carrying out the method according 
any one or any of the claims 1-4 and of the kind comprising 


a) at least one suction-moulding station (10,12) for 
moulding blanks or preforms (46) of at least approximately 

the same shape as the finished objects by aspirating pulp 
mass against a liquid-permeable moulding surface, 
b) a drying station (18) for complete or partial 
drying of the blank or preform thus produced, 
c) at least one work station for finishing processing 
of the final object, and 
d) a conveying path (20) for conveying the blank or 
preform to the work station or stations,

e) that the suction-moulding station (10,12) is adapted 
to produce integral bodies (46,48) each consisting of a 

plurality of blanks or preforms (46) mutually connected 
through bridges (48), said integral bodies being adapted to 

be conveyed along said conveying path (20), 
f) that the work station or stations is/are adapted 
to finish-process blanks or preforms in each integral body 

simultaneously, the station or stations for this purpose 
comprising a number of working means corresponding to the 

number of blanks or preforms, said working means being placed 
in substantially the same configuration as the configuration 

of the blanks or preforms in the integral body and adapted  
 

to process the blanks or preforms substantially simultaneously, 
and 
g) that the plant comprises at least one station 
(Fig. 10) adapted to disrupt the bridges with a view to 

liberating the individual finished-processed objects (46) 
from each other. 
Plant according to claim 5,

adapted to hold the integral body and move the latter under 
positive mechanical control along the conveying path with 

the integral body resting on this path or on conveying support 
means.
