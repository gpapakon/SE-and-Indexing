<ABSTRACT>
A polyoxymethylene composition with improved heat 
stability, particularly reduced in the amount of deposit 

formed on molds during molding, and useful for the production 
of electrical or electronic components is prepared by blending 

100 parts by weight of a polyoxymethylene with (a) 0.01 to 5.0 
parts by weight of an antioxidant, (b) 0.01 to 5.0 parts by 

weight of a melamine-formaldehyde polycondensate and (c) 0.001 
to 10 parts by weight of at least one metallic compound 

selected from among oxides and carbonates of magnesium and 
calcium. Electrical or electronic components made of the 

composition are less prone to suffer from malfunction 
resulting from formic acid generation.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a polyoxymethylene
composition which is improved in heat stability, particularly
reduced in the amount of deposit formed on molds during
molding, and which is useful for the production of the part of
electrical or electronic equipment to give electrical or
electronic equipment which little suffers from malfunction due
to the formic acid generated from the composition (the
malfunction including staining with the substance bleeding
from a part made from a rubber and corrosion of a magnetic
metal member). Also, the present invention relates to a
molded article of the polyoxymethylene composition.The polyoxymethylene is a homopolymer or copolymer
prepared from formaldehyde, trioxane being a cyclic oligomer
thereof, or trioxane in combination with a comonomer such as a
cyclic ether or a cyclic formal, has stabilized molecular
terminals, and is blended with additives such as an
antioxidant or any other heat stabilizer in order to prevent
the decomposition thereof.A melamine-formaldehyde polycondensate is known as a
useful additive among others. The use of a combination of an
antioxidant and a water-soluble melamine-formaldehyde
polycondensate and the use of an antioxidant and a
water-insoluble melamine-formaldehyde polycondensate are
respectively proposed in German Patent Laid-Open No. 1694097
and Japanese Patent Laid-Open No. 33943/1977. These
combinations improve the heat stability of the
polyoxymethylene. However, further improvement is
increasingly demanded in the properties thereof as a material,
depending on the field in which the polyoxymethylene is
utilized. The above demand is, for example, a reduction in the
malfunction of mechanical parts for use in electrical or
electronic equipment such as audio and video systems.Illustratively, the audio or video mechanical parts
manufactured and assembled in a highly cleaned environment
such as a dust-free room for the purpose of avoiding
contamination attributed to the environment, are likely to
suffer troubles in the practical operation when exposed to a
high-temperature and high-humidity atmosphere, though there is
no environmental contamination attributed to e.g. dust. This
is because the additives contained in a rubber roller employed
as a member of the audio or video mechanical part bleed to the
rubber surface and contaminate the magnetic head through the
magnetic tape. The rubber surface disposed in the audio or
video mechanical part thus exposed to a high-temperature and
high-humidity atmosphere is cleaned as a
