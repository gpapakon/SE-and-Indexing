<ABSTRACT>
The present invention includes an automotive 
exhaust system including a catalytic converter (16) 

having a substrate (22) of substantial surface area 
and having a catalyst composition carried thereon. 

The catalytic converter substrate (22) is carried in a 
housing (24) extending the length of the catalytic 

converter substrate (22) and conforming to the outer 
surfaces of the substrate (22) and mounting material 

(26). A two-wall diffuser (28) is connected by an 
outer wall (30) to the converter housing (24) at one 

end (32) and to an exhaust pipe (14) at the other end 
(34). An inner wall (36) is spaced at a distance from 

the outer wall (30) and defines a diffuser portion 
(A-B) h
aving an inlet cross-sectional flow area less 
than its outlet cross-sectional flow area. The inner 

wall (36) also defines an abrupt expansion section 
(40) which is provided between the end of the diffuser 

section (A-B) and an end (42) of the inner wall (36) 
nearest the substrate (22). The inner wall (36) ends 

in the region between the substrate (22) and the 
converter housing (24) and is free-floating and is not 

rigidly connected to either the converter substrate 
(22) or the housing (24). Thus, the inner wall (36) 

is free to move with thermal cycling associated with 
operation of the automobile combustion engine. The 

space (44) provided between the inner wall (36) and 
the outer wall (30) of the diffuser (28) provides a 

thermal insulating air barrier which limits the 
thermal expansion and contraction that the outer wall 

(30) experiences at its mechanical connections to the 
converter housing (24) and exhaust pipe (14).

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to automotive and
truck exhaust systems including a diffuser on the
inlet end of an automotive catalytic converter as
specified in the preamble of claim 1.Diffusers are well-known in the art. A
diffuser is a device for reducing the velocity and
increasing the static pressure of a fluid passing
through the same such as in an automotive exhaust
system. Diffusers of this type have an inlet
cross-sectional flow area that is less than their
outlet cross-sectional flow area. Often diffusers are
used for the specific purpose of reducing fluid
velocity or increasing fluid pressure. However, the
use of a diffuser may be dictated simply by the
physical requirements of an exhaust system such as
increasing the cross-sectional flow area of a passage
in order to connect sections of different
cross-sectional area to one another. This is the
situation wherein a small diameter exhaust pipe is
connected to a larger diameter housing for a catalytic
converter. However, such diffusers which are dictated
by the physical connection between pipes of different
sizes, do not necessarily allow for accurate control
of fluid velocity and pressure to achieve optimum
performance of an automotive combustion engine or a
catalytic converter therefor.An automotive catalytic converter is used to
decrease exhaust emissions by converting carbon
monoxide, nitrogen oxides, and unburned hydrocarbons
present in an exhaust gas into more innocuous
compounds. The catalytic converter includes a
substrate which carries a catalyst for converting the
aforesaid exhaust emissions. Suitable catalysts are
known to those skilled in the art and include for 
example platinum-containing compositions. For
platinum-containing compositions or compositions
including other expensive metals it is important to
utilise the catalytic converter in the most efficient
manner. Thus, it is important to adjust the flow
characteristics of the exhaust gas being treated so as
to provide a uniform velocity distribution across the
substrate cross-section, so that the expensive
catalyst can convert the emissions whilst utilising
the smallest amount of catalyst carried on the
catalytic converter substrate.The uniform velocity field at the substrate
inlet face is also desirable because it leads to the
smallest pressure loss across the converter for a
given substrate geometry and engine exhaust flow.
High pressure loss leads directly to increased engine
back-pressure which results in reduced engine power at
high load and reduced fuel economy.The catalytic
