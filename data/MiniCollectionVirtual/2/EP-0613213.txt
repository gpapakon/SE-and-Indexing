<ABSTRACT>
A terminal made from strip material, especially for service apparatuses, for example line protection circuit breakers or residual current devices (earth leakage current circuit breakers), the terminal having a frame-like folded terminal body (1) with limbs (3; 4) located one above the other, guiding a terminal screw (2) in the terminal body and possibly accommodating a pressure piece between the terminal screw and the terminal body, side flaps of the internally located limb (3) engaging over the externally located limb (4). It is provided that the externally located limb (4) is bent up from the flaps (5) engaging around it into an outer plane (6), and that the externally located flap ends (7) are forced towards the bent-up region (8) of the externally located limb (4) until it comes into contact with at least a sub-region of its narrow side (9).

Terminal consisting of strip material, in 
particular for installation devices, for example 

circuit breakers or ground-fault circuit interrupters, 
which terminal has a frame-like folded terminal body 

(1) with limbs (3;4) one on top of the other and leads 
a terminal screw (2) in the terminal body and possibly 

receives a pressure piece between the terminal screw 
and the terminal body, whereby the inner limb (3) with 

lateral lugs (5) engages over the outer limb (4), 
characterized in that the outer limb (4) at the free 

end is bent upwards at a right angle into an outer 
plane (6) of the encompassing lugs (5) and in that the 

outer lug ends (7) are pressed down to the region (8) 
of the outer limb (4) which is bent upwards at a right 

angle until they make contact with at least a partial 
region of their narrow side (9). 
Terminal according to claim 1, characterized 
in that the inner limb (3) with its narrow side (10) is 

applied to the wall of the terminal body. 
Terminal according to claim 1 or 2, 
characterized in that the terminal screw (2) is guided 

in a thread in the inner and in the outer limb (3;4), 
whereby the encompassing lateral lugs (5) in their 

outer plane (6) are self-supporting with respect to the 
terminal screw (2). 
Terminal according to claim 1 or 2, 
characterized in that the region 8 of the inner limb 

(3) which is bent upwards at a right angle is designed 
in the outer plane (6) of the encompassing lateral lugs 

(5) to be elongated into a supporting or gripping end 
(12). 
Terminal according to claim 1 or 2, 
characterized in that the outer lateral lugs (5) in 

their outer plane (6) are designed to be elongated into 
a supporting or gripping end (13).  

 
Terminal according to claim 1 or 2, 
characterized in that the limbs in the region where 

they lie one on top of the other and in the bending 
region are designed to be narrower than is the case 

with the rest of the terminal body at least by the 
dimension of the thickness of the lateral lugs (5). 
Terminal according to claim 1, 2 or one of the 
preceding claims, characterized in that before its 

region (8) which is bent upwards at a right angle the 
outer limb (4) is bent at a right angle in the opposite 

direction. 
Terminal according to claim 1 or 2, 
characterized in that the encompassing lateral lugs (5) 

have in each case at least one recess (14) over the 
longitudinal side of the limbs (3;4) which lie one on 

top of the other.
