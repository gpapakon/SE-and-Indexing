<DESCRIPTION>
 NUCLEASE STABLE AND BINDING COMPETENT OLIGOMERS AND METHODS FOR THEIR USE&10 Technical FieldThe invention relates generally to novel oligonucleotide analogs, nucleoside analogs and their use in oligonucleotide-based therapies and diagnosis by bind¬ ing of the oligonucleotide analogs to single or double15 stranded nucleic acid target sequences. More specifi¬ cally, the invention concerns oligomers containing ribo- acetal and related substitute linkages and the novel nucleoside analogs used to synthesize such oligomers.20 Background ArtThe application of oligonucleotides and oligo¬ nucleotide analogs (oligomers) for therapeutic uses rep¬ resents a relatively new development in drug design and discovery. Several fundamental therapeutic approaches25 that utilize oligomers have been proposed.One approach is based largely on interfering with gene expression through oligomer binding to a com¬ plementary RNA sequence. This application is known as "antisense" therapy because the oligomer base sequence is30 identical to the antisense strand of the gene that gave rise to the RNA (Uhlmann, E. , et al., Chem Reviews (1990) 9 :543-584) . Another approach, referred to herein as "triple helix" therapy utilizes oligomers that bind to duplex DNA as detailed below. Binding to a target DNA is35 

 sequence specific but involves different base pairing rules. ,Both antisense and triple helix therapies exert therapeutic effects via binding to complementary nucleic acid sequences that are responsible for disease conditions or sequences that are found in the genome of pathogenic organisms such as bacteria, protozoa, fungi or viruses. By modulating the expression of a gene important for establishment, maintenance or elimination of a disease condition, the corresponding condition may be cured, prevented or ameliorated.Another therapeutic approach that is based on the use of oligomers includes generation of "aptamers" and is disclosed and claimed in commonly owned app- lication nos. 745,215, 659,980 and 658,849. This approach utilizes oligomers that specifically bind to proteins thereby interfering with their function. The use of oligomers that mimic the structure of certain RNA molecules that are bound by intracellular proteins has also been adduced as a therapeutic approach as described in international application no. PCT/US91/01822.Modifications of binding competent oligomers that enhance their affinity for target sequences will generally improve the therapeutic potential for oligomers used as therapeutic agents and their
