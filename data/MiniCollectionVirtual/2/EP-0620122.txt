<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a 
thermosensitive recording material on which colored 
images are formed by heating. More particularly, the 
present invention relates to a thermosensitive recording 
material capable of forming thereon colored images 
resistant to fading and thus exhibiting a high degree of 
persistency during extended storage thereof. The thermosensitive recording material of the 
present invention is capable of recording thereon colored 
images exhibiting an excellent resistance to water, oily 
and fatty substances, and plasticizers, and thus has 
superior persistency when stored over a long period of 
time and therefore is useful as colored image-recording 
sheets, sheets for use in facsimiles, word processors, 
CRT image printers and cash dispensers, as passenger 
tickets, commuter passes, labels such as POS labels, 
cards such as prepaid cards, and as transit passes. It is known that a conventional thermosensitive 
recording material comprises a supporting substrate, for 
example, a paper sheet, synthetic paper sheet, or plastic 
resin film and a thermosensitive colored image-forming 
layer formed on a surface of the supporting substrate and 
comprising an electron-donative dye precursor, for 
example, a leuco basic dye, an electron-acceptive color-developing 
agent consisting of an organic acid substance, 
for example, a phenolic compound, and a binder. When the 
thermosensitive colored image-forming layer is heated 
imagewise, colored images are recorded thereon by a 
reaction of the dye precursor with the color-developing 
agent. This type of thermosensitive recording material  
 
is disclosed in Japanese Examined Patent Publication 
Nos. 43-4,160 and 45-14,039 and Japanese Unexamined 
Patent Publication No. 48-27,736, and is widely employed 
in practice. Namely, the thermosensitive recording material 
is advantageous in that colored images can be easily 
formed by heating alone, and the recording apparatus can 
be made compact and small in size, has a relatively low 
price, and can be easily maintained. Therefore, the 
thermosensitive recording material is appreciated as a 
useful information-recording material for recording 
outputs of printers used with, for example, computers, 
facsimile machines, automatic ticket-vending machines, 
scientific measurement recorders, and CRT medical 
measurement recorders. Nevertheless, the conventional dye-forming type 
thermosensitive recording materials in which the 
thermosensitive colored image-forming layer comprises a 
conventional
