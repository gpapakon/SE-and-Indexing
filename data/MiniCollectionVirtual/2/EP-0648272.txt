<ABSTRACT>
A delivery system, especially for delivery to targeted sites in the human or animal body, comprises capsids of the coat protein amino acid sequence of phage MS-2 or related phage, or a modification thereof which retains capsid-forming capability, or sufficient of said sequence or modification to retain capsid-forming capability, at least some of said capsids enclosing a moiety foreign to the genome of MS-2 or related phage.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a protein-based delivery system and is particularly directed 
to the delivery of encapsidated active materials, especially to targeted sites in the human 
or animal body. There is increasing interest in the targeting of active substances to the sites in the 
body where their activity is required. Thus it is important that drugs, particularly those 
having undesirable side effects, are delivered to the site where they are to act. Many other 
molecular species require to be delivered in a site specific manner, often to particular cells, 
for example polynucleotides (anti-sense or ribozymes), metabolic co-factors or imaging 
agents. One such system has been described by Wu etal., J. Biol. Chem., 263, 
14621-14624 and WO-A-9206180, in which a nucleic acid useful for gene therapy is 
complexed with polylysine linked to galactose which is recognised by the 
asialoglycoprotein receptors on the surface of cells to be targeted. However, there are many 
occasions, such as in the delivery of a cytotoxic drug, when it would not be satisfactory to 
use a delivery system in which the drug to be delivered is so exposed. There is therefore 
a need to develop alternative delivery systems which have the flexibility to target a wide 
range of active materials. European patent publications 0572433 and 0591369 describe the modification of 
the coat protein of phage MS-2 as a presentation system for epitopic species, which may 
be included in a modified coat protein sequence or attached to the coat protein via a 
cysteine residue and optional further spacer. These applications relied on the ability of 
the coat protein MS-2 and similar phages to be cloned and expressed in a bacterial host 
such as E. coli as largely RNA-free empty phage particles. Romaniuk etal., (1987), 
Biochemistry 26, 1563-1568 have studied the relationship between the MS-2 coat protein 
and the RNA genome. It is apparent that, although RNA-free coat  
 
protein assemblies can be produced in E. coli, capsid formation in natural infections is 
triggered by coat protein interaction with a 19 base stem-loop (translational operator) in the 
RNA genome sequence. Talbot etal., 1990, Nucleic Acid Research 18, No. 12, 3521-3528 
have synthesised the 19 base sequence and variations of this sequence and investigated the 
recognition and binding by the coat protein. It has been found that the translational 
operator RNA signal is also recognised as a short fragment of just 19 bases. Recombinant 
coat protein retains the ability to bind
