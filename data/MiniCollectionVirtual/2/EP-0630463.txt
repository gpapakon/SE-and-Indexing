<ABSTRACT>
An electric instantaneous water heater has a cold water inlet (1), a volumetric flow-dependent control device (3) for controlling the heating capacity, an insulating section (4), a heating section (5) and a second insulating section (6). The heating section is composed of several tubular modules (5a, 5b, 5c) with a rounded plastic tube (51) for receiving a heating spiral (50a, 50b, 50c). Helicoidal ribs (52) are shaped on the inner wall of said reception tube to increase the turbulence of the water flowing through the heating module. The first and second insulating sections (4, 6) are designed as flexible hoses pressure-tightly coupled each to a connecting branch (44, 63) of a heating module (5a, 5c). The individual heating modules can be easily exchanged.
