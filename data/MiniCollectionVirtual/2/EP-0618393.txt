<ABSTRACT>
The present invention relates to a coupling device for hose lines and/or pipelines, in particular for wall lead-throughs for pressure-medium lines, having at least one plug-in coupling (2) comprising two coupling parts, namely a plug-in part (4) and a socket part (6), and having two coupling plates (18, 20) which can be connected to one another in an essentially parallel arrangement. The coupling parts (4, 6) of the or of each plug-in coupling (2) are seated in receiving openings (22, 24), which are located opposite one another in alignment and belong to the coupling plates (18, 20), such that, by connecting the coupling plates (18, 20), they are plugged one into the other in a sealing manner in the adjoining direction and are arrested in this coupling position. Each coupling part (4, 6) is fixed in the associated receiving opening (22, 24) of the respective coupling plate (18, 20) via latching means (26) which are designed such that on the one hand, when the coupling plates (18, 20) are separated, it can be plugged, in a latching and releasable manner, into the corresponding receiving opening (22, 24) of the respective coupling plate (18, 20), from its rear side (28, 30) remote from the other coupling plate (20/18), and on the other hand, in the connected state of the coupling plates (18, 20), it is held non-releasably due to locking of the latching means (26).

A coupling means for hose and/or pipe lines, in particular 
for guiding pressurized medium lines through walls, having at 

least one plug-type coupling (2) comprising two coupling parts, 
namely a plug part (4) and a socket part (6), and having two 

coupling plates (18, 20) which may be connected to one another 
in a substantially parallel arrangement, the coupling parts (4, 

6) of the or each plug-type coupling (2) being seated in 
receiving openings (22, 24) in the coupling plates (18, 20) which 

oppose one another in flush manner in such a way that, by 
connecting the coupling plates (18, 20), they are plugged into 

one another in sealing manner in the direction of joining and are 
locked in this coupled position, characterized in that each 

coupling part (4, 6) is fixed in the associated receiving opening 
(22, 24) in the respective coupling plate (18, 20) by way of 

latching means (26) which are constructed such that each coupling 
part (4, 6) is on the one hand, when the coupling plates (18, 20) 

are separated, capable of being plugged in latching and 
detachable manner into the corresponding receiving opening (22, 

24) in the respective coupling plate (18, 20) from the rear side 
(28, 30) thereof, remote from the other coupling plate (20/18), 

and on the other hand, in the connected state of the coupling 
plates (18, 20), is held non-detachably by the blocking action 

of the latching means (26). 
A coupling means according to Claim 1, characterized in that 
the coupling plates (18, 20) have as the latching means (26) 

latching arms (32, 34) which are radially elastic in the manner 
of springs, are each arranged distributed over the periphery of 

the receiving opening (22, 24) and extend, starting from the rear 
side (28, 30) of the coupling plate (18, 20), substantially in 

the direction of joining the coupling parts (4, 6). 
A coupling means according to Claim 2, characterized in that  
 

the latching arms (32, 34) have, in their region pointing towards 
the coupling side (36, 38) of the respective coupling plate (18, 

20), latching shoulders (40) which project radially inwards into 
the receiving opening (22, 24) and cooperate i
n latching manner 
with an annular groove (42) in the respective coupling part (4, 

6). 
A coupling means according to Claim 2 or 3, characterized 
in that the latching arms (34) of the one coupling plate (20) 

have blocking shoulders (44) which point in the direction of 
joining and, in the connected state of the coupling plates (18, 

20), engage in an annular gap (46) surrounding the latching arms 
(32) of the other coupling plate (18) in a manner such that all 

the latching arms (32, 34) of both coupling plates (18, 20) are 
blocked to prevent radial movement. 
A coupling means according to one or more of Claims 1 to 4, 
characterized in that, for mounting a plurality of plug-type 

couplings (2), the coupling plates (18, 20) have a corresponding 
number of receiving openings (22, 24). 
A coupling means according to one or more of Claims 1 to 5, 
characterized in that each coupling plate (18, 20) is constructed 

as a moulded part of synthetic material. 
A coupling means according to one or more of Claims 1 to 6, 
characterized in that the coupling plates (18, 20) may be clamped 

against one another, in particular by way of screw connections, 
and preferably with the interposition of a sealing element. 
A coupling means according to one or more of Claims 1 to 
7, characterized in that the plug part (4) and/or the socket part 

(6) is/are sealed peripherally with respect to the receiving 
opening (22, 24) of the respective coupling plate (18, 20). 
A coupling means according to one or more of Claims 1 to 8, 
characterized in that the coupling parts (4, 6) each have a  

 
connecting branch (14, 16), in particular a drive-in spike onto 

which a line, in particular a synthetic pipe, can be pushed.
