<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a method for the pre-treatment
of coated glasses before heat treatment. In
the heat treatment the glass plate is heated and then
cooled preferably by air jets.As is well-known, the resistance of glasses to
various strains can be increased by thoroughly heating
the glass up to 580°C...700°C and then cooling it
rapidly by air jets directed to its surfaces. The
temperature of the upper and lower surfaces of the
glass plate drops more rapidly than that of the interior
of the glass plate. As a result, the surfaces of
the glass plate solidify earlier than the interior of
the glass. When the surface temperatures decrease, the
surfaces tend to shrink. The interior of the glass
plate prevents the shrinking of the solidified surface
portions. As the interior of the glass has not solidified,
it tends to stretch. As a result, there is a
compression stress state on the surface and a tensile
stress state in the interior.The strength properties of glass plates depend
on the differences between the surface and interior
stresses. With sufficient stress differences, the
glass will be provided with safety glass properties. A
glass plate heat-treated in this way is known as
hardened safety glass. Hardened safety glass has a
bending strength about five times higher than that of
glasses which have not been heat-treated.It is typical of hardened safety glasses that
they have a bending strength five times higher, a
resistance to rapid temperature changes ten times
higher, and an impact strength significantly higher
than glasses not treated by heat. If hardened safety 
glass is broken, small roundish pea-size lightweight
pieces are formed which are not injurious to people.A further measurable property of hardened safety
glasses is the number of pieces formed at breakage
within an area of 50 mm2 x 50 mm2 and the shape and
size of the pieces. An allowable number of pieces
within such an area is between 50 and 400. In a broken
plate of hardened glass, none of the pieces must be
sharp or have the shape of a dagger blade.The glass hardening method is widely known.
Hardening of a coated glass plate is described in US
Patent No. 4,857,094.When stress differences between the surfaces and
the interior of the glass plate are smaller than in
hardened safety glasses, the glass does not fulfil the
requirements made of safety glass. However, the bending
strength of such glass is about two times greater
than that of glass not treated by heat, and the
product is called heat-toughened glass. Similarly as
with ordinary

Method for the pre-treatment of glass plates (1) coated with a heat-radiation
reflecting coating before their heat treatment, 
characterized in that
 the coating (2)
is removed from the edge area (3, 4) of the glass plate.
Method according to claim 1, 
characterized in that
 the edge areas (4) are bevelled
with respect to the plane of the coating (2) of the glass plate (1).
Method for pre-treating a coated glass plate (1) before heat treatment, the coated glass
plate having an edge area (3, 4) parallel to the plane of the glass plate and further

having a resistive, heat-radiation reflecting coating (2),
the coating containing conduction electrons, the heat treatment

including heating the glass plate to an elevated temperature ranging from 580 to
700° C and cooling the glass plate rapidly so as to produce surface compression stresses

on the glass plate, 
characterized in that
 an edge part of the coating (2) is removed from the
edge area (3, 4) of the glass plate (1) to produce an uncoated portion of

the glass plate before the heat treatment, so as to maintain a substantially uniform
resistivity across the glass plate when cooling from the elevated temperature.
