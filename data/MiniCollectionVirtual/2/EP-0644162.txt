<ABSTRACT>
In the case of a method for controlling the free deformation of thermoplastic material in an automated process for further processing the material into articles, in particular in the manufacture of ampoules, small bottles and the like from glass tube, in which a corrective intervention is made by means of the heat effect on the starting material in the heating-up phase for achieving a high degree of accuracy of the article in dependence on a set/actual comparison of the deformation of a workpiece achieved in the deformation range in a predetermined fabrication step, the measuring of the deformation achieved, the set/actual comparison and the corrective intervention are performed in situ in the heating-up phase during the development of the deformation on one and the same workpiece in order to eliminate disturbing influences in the development of the deformation.

Method for controlling the free deformation of thermoplastic material in an automated
process for further processing materials into articles, in particular in the manufacture of

ampoules, small bottles and the like from glass tube,

in which in order to achieve a high dimensional accuracy of the articles, there takes
place in the deformation zone, depending on a desired/actual comparison of the

deformation of a work piece (2) achieved in a predetermined processing step, a
correcting intervention by way of the effect of heat on the starting material in the

heating phase, with the size of the deformation being dependent on influencing
variables such as, for example, the effect time of the burner, the calorific value of the

gas, the constancy over time of the quantities of gas, oxygen and combustion air, the
temperature, the draught, and the progressive consumption and the geometric

dimensions of the glass tube,

characterised in that

on one and the same work piece (2) the deformation is measured, the desired/actual
comparison is made, and the correcting intervention is undertaken, in situ during the

effecting of the deformation in the heating phase, with the desired/actual comparison
being made at a point in time at which all the influencing variables have already

affected the deformation in measurable manner, yet there remains still to be effected a
sufficiently large deformation, and the deformation which remains to be effected is

controlled from the latter comparison based on the measuring results.
Method according to Claim 1,

characterised in that

the deformation of the heat-softened material is measured in contactless manner.
Method according to Claim 2,

characterised in that measuring is carried out by means of optical dimension sensors.
Method according to Claim 2 or 3,

characterised in that the contactless measuring takes place by way of the thermal
radiation emitted by the heated starting material. 
Method according to Claim 4,

characterised in that the thermal radiation is measured in a spectral region in which the
radiation emitted by the burner flames is not disruptive.
Method according to Claim 4 or 5,

characterised in that the thermal radiation is measured in a spectral region in which the
radiation intensity is independent of the thickness of the material.
Method according to at least one of Claims 1 to 6,

characterised in that in the case of a tubular starting material (2) the diameter of the
constriction which forms on heating is adjusted to a predetermined value.
Method according to Claim 7,

characterised in that the change over time in the diameter of the constriction is
detected during the deformation process.
Method according to at least one of Claims 1 to 8,

characterised in that the results of the desired/actual comparison deformation achieved
are converted by way of empirically determined characteristic lines into corresponding

control signals for the correcting intervention in the further deformation process.
Method according to at least one of Claims 1 to 9,

characterised in that the results of the desired/actual comparison are also utilised for
correcting adjacent imparted forms.
Method according to at least one of Claims 1 to 10,

characterised in that the correcting intervention takes place by way of the following
time of individually controllable burners (7) and/or as a result of the sequential

switching on and off of a series of burners.
Method according to Claim 11,
 
characterised in that the correcting intervention takes place by way of the O
2
 addition
to the individually controllable burners.
Method according to at least one of Claims 1 to 12,

characterised in that the correcting intervention takes place by way of the intensity, the
intensity distribution and/or the duration of the effect of electromagnetic radiation.
Method according to Claim 13,

characterised in that the radiation of a CO
2
 laser is used.
Method according to at least one of Claims 1 to 14,

characterised in that the correcting intervention takes place as a result of controlled
cooling.
Method according to at least one of Claims 1 to 15,

characterised in that measurement, interpretation and control take place in computer-aided
manner.
Method according to at least one of Claims 1 to 16,

characterised in that the diameter of the tubular work piece (2) in the constriction zone
is scanned by means of an IR camera (4).
Method according to at least one of Claims 1 to 17,

characterised in that there takes place a further correcting intervention by way of the
O
2
 supply to the burners (3) of the preheating zone, in order to maintain the average
diameter of the measured constriction at the average correcting intervention of the

individually controllable burners (7).
Method according to at least one of Claims 7 to 18,

characterised in that the dimension and lateral position of the constriction of the work
pieces is measured for at least one revolution in order to recognise and separate work

pieces having inadmissibly oval or eccentric constrictions.
