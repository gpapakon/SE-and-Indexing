<ABSTRACT>
In the case of a screwdriving tool for screws (3) connected by a strip, a movable lifting-off member (18) is provided in the guiding channel (11) of bearing body (1) in the region of the guiding bore (12) for the screwdriving blade (14), in the case of the screw strip (2) the lifting-off member lifting off the connecting band (5) from the screw (3') to be screwed in. The latter can thus be screwed into the workpiece (16) unhindered, which is advantageous especially in the case of screws (3) with large head diameter or with sealing washers (10) placed underneath.

<CLAIMS>
A screwdriving unit for belt-fed screws having a bearing element in which a 
drivable screw- driver blade is movably mounted, having a guide channel 

vertical thereto for the screws linked up to a screw strip by at least one 
connecting belt, having a conveying device for said screw strip, and having a 

guide hole for the screw to be screwed in, 
characterized in that
 a movable 
lift-off element (18) is provided in said guide channel (11) in the area of said 

guide hole (12) and is actuatable transversely to said guide channel (11) such 
that it lifts said connecting belt (5) off said screw (3') to be screwed in. 
A screwdriving unit according to Claim 1, 
characterized
 in that said 
lift-off element (18) interacts with the free end of said connecting belt (5). 
A screwdriving unit according to Claim 1 or Claim 2, 
characterized
 
that said lift-off element (18) is actuatable by said screw (3') to be screwed in. 
A screwdriving unit according to one of Claims 1 to 3, 
characterized
 
in that said lift-off element (18) is pivotably mounted in said bearing element 

(1). 
A screwdriving unit according to Claim 4, 
characterized
 in that the 
swivel axis (19) of said lift-off element (18) is disposed inclined in relation to 

said guide hole (12). 
A screwdriving unit according to one of Claims 1 to 5, 
characterized
 
in that said lift-off element (18) has an inclined contact surface (23) oriented 

towards said screwdriver blade (14).  
 
A screwdriving unit according to one of Claims 1 to 6, 
characterized
 
in that said lift-off element (18) has a centering surface (24) for said screw (3') 

oriented towards said guide channel (11) and parallel to said guide hole (12). 
A screwdriving unit according to one of Claims 3 to 7, 
characterized
 
in that said screw (3') has in its head portion (9, 10) a considerably larger 

diameter in relation to the shank (8) and in that said lift-off element (18) is 
actuatable by said head portion (9, 10).
