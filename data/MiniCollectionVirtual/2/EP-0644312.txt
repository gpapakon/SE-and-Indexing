<ABSTRACT>
A set-square composed of two flat 
and superposed angle bars (1,2) inserted 

into the ends of said sections (6,7) and provided with a 
tensioning dowel (4) to allow teeth (3,3a) protruding from an 

angle bar to insert stably into eyelets (8,8a) obtained in the 
walls of said sections; said structure being provided 

with wedge-shaped means (10) for driving and restraining 
said dowel during the screwing, for the shifting of the 

upper angle bar on the lower angle bar, and with plug-in 
hooking means (11,12), obtained transversally on the matching 

faces of said angle bars, suitable to prevent, 
during the tensioning of said dowel, the rotation 

and/or shiftings of the flanges of the upper angle bar 
relatively to the lower angle bar, and to allow the 

regular engagement of said teeth into the relevant 
eyelets and the safe and stable locking of the sections 

with one another.

<DESCRIPTION>
Object of this invention is to provide a set-square-shaped 
connecting structure, particularly suitable to 
realize stable right-angle connections of the ends of 
hollow metal sections utilized for door- and window 
frames, casings and the like. As is known, the most widespread present technique for 
the 90° connection of hollow metal sections, utilized 
to produce door- and window frames and casings and 
similar structures, involves the cutting at 45° of the 
ends of each couple of sections to be connected at 90°, 
and their connection by means of couples of two-flange 
elements or bars, usually called set-squares, bent at a 
right angle relatively to one another; a couple of 
flanges is inserted into the end of a section and the 
other couple into the end of the other section to be 
connected to the first one, and then locked to one 
another and to the sections. Generally, said set-squares are composed by two angle 
bars, constituted each by two flat bars, arranged at 
90° and inserted into the sections in superposed position 
relatively to one another, until they are freely 
positioned against the opposing internal walls of the 
sections. The pressure-connection of the ends of the 
two sections is obtained by means of a screw, inserted 
in a hole obtained in the corner of the sections and 
positioned with its axis on the cutting plane of said  
 
sections. Said screw engages only into the corner of the couple 
of bars which is superposed to the other couple. By screwing said screw, the end of this heads towards a 
flat seat obtained in the corner of the two bars forming 
the lower angle bar, causing the slipping of the 
outermost couple of bars on the innermost ones (which 
are in touch with the opposing walls of the two sections); 
said slipping shifts the bars of the outermost 
angle bar towards the corner of the sections, which 
bars force a tooth or the like protruding from them to 
stable insert into an eyelet obtained in the external 
walls of the two sections; if the tensioning of the 
screw goes on, the two sections are pushed against one 
another, realizing in this way a stable connection. In practice, as the two angle bars forming the connecting 
set-square are constituted by metal straps of 
different lengths, and precisely as the tensioning one, 
positioned on the lower one is tighter than the other 
one, the drawback creates that the screw, by operating 
on a flat seat of the corner of the lower angle bar, 
tends to cause the rotation of the flanges of the upper 
angle bar on those of

Set-square connecting structure for the right-angle 
connection of the ends, cut at 45°, of hollow sections 

for door- and window frames, casings and the like, 
utilizing a set-square composed by two flat and superposed 

angle bars, inserted in said ends of the sections 
and provided with a tensioning dowel, so as to realize 

the stable tightening of said ends through the hooking 
of teeth protruding from the upper angle bar into 

eyelets obtained in the walls of the sections, characterized 
in that it comprises substantially wedge-shaped 

means having the function of guide and restraint for 
said screw, interposed between the corner of the lower 

angle bar and the end of the tensioning screw placed as 
an engament means on the corner of the upper angle bar 

and opereratable through a hole obtained in the corner 
of the right-angle-approached sections, as well as 

plug-in hooking means obtained, perpendicularly to the 
axis of the sections, on the faces in touch with one 

another of the two superposed angle bars, suitable to 
prevent the rotation, during the tensioning of the 

screw, of the flanges of the upper angle bar relatively 
to those of the lower angle bar, ensuring in this way 

the regular hooking of said teeth of the upper angle 
bar into the corresponding eyelets of the sections and 

the perfect positioning and locking between one another 
of the ends of said sections. 
Connecting structure according to claim 1, characterized 
in that said hooking means between said superposed 

angle bars are constituted by at least a rib or 
continuous projection, obtained transversally on the 

flanges of the lower angle bar, enaged with at least a 
corresponding groove obtained on the flanges of the 

upper angle bar subject to tensioning, the coupling 
between said ribs and the relevant grooves being realized 

with a clearance to allow, during the tensioning of 
said dowel, the shifting of the upper angle bar and the 

ensuing hooking of said teeth in the respective eyelets. 
Connecting structure according to claim 1, characterized 
in that it provides for guide and restraint means 

for said tightening dowel, constituted by a substantially 
conic protrusion, protruding from the lower 

angle bar and inserted into a corresponding conic 
hollow space obtained in the ends of said dowel. 
Connecting structure, according to claim 1, characterized 
in that said transversal ribs are obtained on 

the flanges of the translatable angle bar and the 
corresponding eyelets on the flanges of the lower angle 

bar. 
Structure according to the above claims, characterized 
in that it is realized in view of the aforementioned 

objects and utilizations, according to what has 
been described and illustrated.
