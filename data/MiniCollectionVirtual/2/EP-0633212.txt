<ABSTRACT>
The transport device (16) has a guide (18) which is closed on itself and in which transport members (20) rotate. These are driven at the start and at the end of the stage (26) having a conveying effect by a respective independently controllable drive device (32, 32') and can be set in their position. Between two transport members (20) there are respective spring elements (64) which are designed solely for the transmission of compressive force. The driving means (34), driving the transport members (20), of the drive devices (32, 32') are preceded by controlled blocking means (36) by which the take-up of transport members (20) by the driving means (34) can be prevented. This ensures that each transport member (20) grasps a printed product (12), even when there are gaps in the imbricated formation (S) supplied. At the delivery point (28), the delivery of printed products (12) can be delayed by the amount of one or more strokes, without stopping the driving means (34). The spring elements (64) allow a different number of transport members (20) between the drive devices (32, 32').

Endlessly circulating item - transporting 
apparatus (16), in particular for printing products 

(12), with a number of transporting members (20) which 
circulate in a guide (18), are driven and can be positioned 

at the beginning and end of their effectively conveying zone (26) 
by in each case an independently controllable drive mechanism (32, 

32') in order to control 
the take-over cycle independently of the delivery 

cycle, and with spring elements (64), arranged between 
the respectively successive transporting members (20), 

for transferring the drive force to transporting 
members (20) located outside the drive mechanisms (32, 

32'), the drive mechanisms (32, 32') having drive means 
(34) for driving the transporting members (20), 

characterized in that the spring elements (64) are 
designed for the exclusive transfer of compressive 

force between the transporting members (20), and the 
drive mechanisms (32, 32') have means which can be 

switched on and off for preventing the transporting 
members (20) from being taken along by the drive means 

(34). 
Transporting apparatus according to Claim 1, 
characterized in that the means for preventing the 

transporting members (20) from being taken along have a 
blocking element (36) which:- precedes the drive means 

(34), in the blocking position (132') holds back 
transporting members (20), and can be released in a 

manner coordinated with the drive means (34).  
 
Transporting apparatus according to Claim 1 or 
2, characterized in that the drive mechanisms (32, 32') 

have a non-return stop (38) which follows the drive 
means (34) and acts on the transporting members (20). 
Transporting apparatus according to one of 
Claims 1 to 3, characterized in that the drive means 

(34) have toothed drive elements (94) driven in a 
circulating manner, and the transporting members (20) 

have tooth-like driving members (96) which are 
intended for meshing with the drive elements (94). 
Transporting apparatus according to Claim 4, 
characterized in that the drive elements (94) have 

chains (120) which are led around sprockets (118) and 
on which there are arranged one behind the other drive 

elements (122) which are designed in a shackle-like 
manner and engage over a plurality of chain links, the 

guide (18) in each case runs along a drive section 
(128) of the path of movement of the drive elements 

(122), and two successive drive elements (122) in each 
case bound a tooth gap (98) in the drive section (128) 

intended for receiving a driving member (96) of a 
transporting member (20). 
Transporting apparatus according to one of 
Claims 1 to 5, characterized in that the transporting
