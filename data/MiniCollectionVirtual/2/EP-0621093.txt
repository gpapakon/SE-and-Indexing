<ABSTRACT>
The invention proposes a transfer device for transferring workpieces (43-47) in a press line, a large-component multiple stage press or the like in which the transfer of the workpieces from one processing station to the next is accomplished via cross members (37-41). In order to permit temporally and spatially independent transfer of the workpieces, the cross members (37-41) each have their own transfer carriages (32, 32a), these being movable independently of one another with several degrees of freedom.

A press line or multiple-die press for large pressings, with a conveyor means for 
transporting workpieces, with serially disposed working stations for the workpiece, in 

which upwardly and downwardly movable rams with tools for reshaping the workpieces 
are disposed, the workpieces being mounted on cross-members which can be transported 

to the working stations by means of independently operable transport means, characterised 
in that associated with each cross-member (37 to 41) there is on both sides a transport 

carriage (32, 32a) comprising drives in a plurality of degrees of freedom and independent 
of other transport carriages on other cross-members, whereby in order to carry out any 

desired workpiece transport step in and against the direction of workpiece transport there 
is a longitudinal drive and also a lifting drive for performing a vertical lifting movement 

of the cross-member and preferably a rotary drive for carrying out a rotary movement of 
the longitudinal axis of the cross-member and in that both the press rams (18 to 21) and 

also the transport carries (32, 32a) for the cross-members (37 to 41) are adapted for 
movement towards one another, the latter with phase displacement. 
A press line or multiple-die press for large pressings, according to claim 1, 
characterised in that the lifting drive for the transport carriages (32, 32a) of a cross-member 

(37 to 41) can be variously loaded in order to achieve a desired sloping attitude 
of the cross-member. 
A press line or multiple-die press for large pressings according to claim 1 or 2, 
characterised in that programmable drives synchronised with the press are provided to 

drive the transport carriage (32, 32a).  
 
A press line or multiple-die press for large pressings according to one of the 
preceding claims, characterised in that the drive of a hydraulic press ram (18 to 21) and/or 

the transport carriages (32, 32a) for the cross-members (37 to 41) is provided by means 
of an overriding control arrangement in order to achieve part-specific m
ovement distances 
of the transport carriages. 
A press line or multiple-die press for large pressings according to one of the 
preceding claims 1 to 4, characterised in that the drive of the transport carriages (32, 32a) 

for the cross-members (37 to 41) is provided by means of electric motors, pinions, racks 
or toothed belt pulleys. 
A press line or multiple-die press for large pressings according to one of the 
preceding claims 1 to 4, characterised in that the drive of the transport carriages (32, 32a) 

for the cross-members (37 to 41) is provided by linear motors. 
A press line or multiple-die press for large pressings according to one or more of 
the preceding claims, characterised in that the drive of the transport carriages (32, 32a) 

for the cross-members (37 to 41) is controlled mechanically by the individual presses by 
means of cam transmissions, levers, splined shafts, toothed belts and racks or the like. 
A press line or multiple-die press for large pressings according to one or more of 
the preceding claims, characterised in that the transport carriages (32, 32a) for the cross-members 

(37 to 41) are guided on supporting rails (31, 31a) which are guided through the 
press or press line. 
A press line or multiple-die press for large pressings according to one or more of 
the preceding claims, characterised in that the supporting rails (31, 31a) are adapted for 

vertical adjustment by separate lifting means with vertically adjustable slideways (30, 30a) 
as well as guides (63 to 67 and 63a to 67a).
