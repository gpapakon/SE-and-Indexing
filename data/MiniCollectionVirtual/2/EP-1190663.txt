<ABSTRACT>
A method for checking the state of a cleaning mop used in special applications has a chip card incorporated into the mop head. The chip card is programmed to follow the life of the mop head and is easily controlled at special control points. The chip card records when the mop head is cleaned and how often it is used. The chip card can be sewn into the pockets (16) on the back of the mop head into which the grip plates of the handle are pushed, or the chip card can be applied onto one edge of the mop head. The chip card is encased in a plastic sheath to protect against soiling.
