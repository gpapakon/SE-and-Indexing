<ABSTRACT>
A pneumatic cylinder, especially for a spot-welding machine, has a 
sleeve valve mounted on the piston rod. The sleeve valve provides a venting 

valve 54,56 for dumping pressure from return chamber 34 at the end of the 
forward stroke, and a progressive restrictor 46,58 to close off forward chamber 

32 and provide cushioning at the end of the return stroke.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a method of operating a pneumatic cylinder, pneumatic cylinders and control valves for such
cylinders. It is particularly applicable to cylinders for use in for example spot
welding machines, piercing machines, powered jigs or clamps.There already exist various types of pneumatic cylinders with either
internal or external flow controls and cushioning devices.For some types of heavy duty production operations these typical designs
do not meet specific production needs. This is especially true of pneumatic
cylinders used in resistance spot welding and some piercing or clamping
operations.For example, in resistance spot welding an air cylinder with an electrode
and associated equipment attached to the piston rod is typically expected to
stroke forward, contact the component and reach full welding force in 0.2 secs.
It must precisely hold this force for the welding and cooling period of typically
0.4 secs and during this period rapidly follow up at constant force the collapse
or indentation of the components during welding.To achieve this fast and then stable force condition it is usual to ensure
that air can be supplied to and exhausted from the power cylinder very quickly.
In addition the end of the forward stroke is determined not by the cylinder but
by the contact point of the electrode which changes during its production life
as the electrode is consumed, worn, re-profiled or replaced.This combination of rapid force build up and variable end of stroke
positioning make traditional cushioning and speed control devices difficult to
apply, and without them the shock loads, noise, wear and vibration of tooling
and equipment in use is considerable. 
One such cylinder is shown in US-A-5.174.191. In that cylinder, the above-described
functions are achieved at the penalty of using a large number of components, leading
to a complex and expensive device.DE-A 3542069 discloses the preamble of claim 1, 2 and 14.The preferred embodiments of the present invention have as one object the
provision of an alternative solution using a much simpler and less expensive
construction. Another object of those embodiments is to provide a cylinder in which
the movement of the piston is braked at the end of its return stroke. In this
specification the term "piston" is used generally to include the piston heads and piston
rods together making up a piston assembly moveable in a cylinder body. Similarly,
"pneumatic" whilst referring primarily to compressed air also includes other
compressed gases used as a

chambers such that pressure fluid supplied to the first chamber effects relative
movement of the piston and cylinder in a first sense, and pressure fluid supplied to the

second chamber effects relative movement of the piston and cylinder in the opposite
sense, the method comprising restrictedly venting the second chamber during relative

movement in the first sense, and upon the said relative movement in the first sense
being arrested then venting the pressure fluid in the second chamber by operating a

moveable valve element, and characterised by progressively restricting a flow of said

fluid being supplied to the second chamber by means of the same valve element when
relative movement of the piston and cylinder in the opposite sense approaches a

limiting extent thereof whereby to moderate said relative movement.
A pneumatic cylinder comprising a cylinder body (10) containing a piston (12)
