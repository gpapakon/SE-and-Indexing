<ABSTRACT>
The system controlling takings and prizes in gaming 
machines subject of the invention, the purpose of which 

is at all times to have a count of the money gambled and 
the prizes awarded in gaming machines giving random 

prizes or the like, comprises the functional association 
of a control means (1), joined to an infrared light 

communication board (2), both linked to the gaming 
machine (3), and an adaptor board (4) linked to a data 

terminal (5), communication between boards (2) and (4) 
being provided to take place by means of infrared 

signals, both being to such end fitted with emitters and 
receivers. 
The control means (1), comprising a microcontrol 
(U1), a supervisor element (U2) and a communications 

element (U3) runs all information reading, storage and 
transmission operations, being moreover fitted with 

elements detecting program running faults and power cuts.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates, as stated in the
heading of this specification, to a system controlling
takings and prizes, the purpose of which is at all times
to have a count of the money gambled and the prizes
awarded in gaming machines giving random prizes or the
like to avoid human or mechanical errors causing takings
in such machines to be diverted.The systems existing nowadays for controlling money
gambled and prizes delivered comprise terminals connected
to the gaming machines with a cable, acquiring the data
they have in order for a computer to subsequently process
such information.This kind of systems implies that there is a need to
be variously connected to each of the existing kinds of
machines, and also a possibility of erroneous data being
inserted for the tests operators run in such machines are
recorded as amounts gambled, causing a deflection of the
data acquired from the gaming machine.An improvement of these conventional systems
consists of the implementation of infrared
communication means, which connect the prize machines
with certain control devices.In this sense, a good example is represented by
the European Patent number 0 555 565 which describes a
device that allows fraud-secure payment of prizes
awarded by fruit machines without the machines having
to be provided with their own respective payment
device. This document is a prior art according to
Art. 54(3) EPC.The device allows a certain money reserve
within the fruit machine to pay out the prizes to be
done without and nevertheless cash prizes to be paid
out without risking manipulation.Fruit machines thus conformed serve this
function providing an additional key connected to a
central control unit. When the key is pressed, the
characteristic data specific to the machine and the
final accumulated prize status or each individual prize
may alternatively be indicated by means of a data
printer or a memory card writing device, which may, if
necessary, be used to verify the authenticity of the
information before the prize is paid out at one of the
cash-registers. Verification can take place directly at
the fruit machine or, once the data originating in and
recorded at the fruit machine are transmitted to a
receiving unit located close to the cash-register, at
the very cash-register.German Patent DE-A-4112188 is also known to
describe a coin-operated gaming machine provided with a
gaming device with symbols, the circular bodies
carrying the winning symbols showing, upon being
stopped by a central control unit and obtained at
random,
</DESCRIPTION>
<CLAIMS>
A system controlling takings and prizes in
gaming machines, designed to establish at all times the

count of money gambled and prizes awarded in gaming
machines giving random prizes or the like, comprising

the functional association of a control means (1) joined
to a infrared light communication board (2), both linked to the gaming

machine (3), and an adaptor board (4) linked to a data
terminal (5), communication between the communication

board (2) and the adaptor board (4) being provided to
take place by wireless means by infrared

spectrum signals, the control means (1) being fitted
with a microcontrol (U1) that runs the counter

operations and acts as an information storage memory
that will be supported by a battery (BT1) in the event

of a power cut, a supervisor element (U2) detecting both
program running faults and power cuts, and a

communication element (U3) establishing information
transmission electrically towards the communication

board. 
A system controlling takings and prizes in
gaming machines, as in the above claim, characterised in

that the control means is supported by a printed circuit
board that is, in addition to the microcontrol elements

(U1), supervisor element (U2), communications element
(U3) and associated electronic circuitry, fitted with a

connector (CN1) through which communication is
established with the gaming machine (3) and with the

board (2), an element (Ux) being provided to position the
board within the machine. 
A system controlling takings and prizes in
gaming machines, as in claim 1, characterised in that

the infrared light communication board (2) has emitter
(LD1) and receiver (U5) elements which together with the

emitter (LD3) and receiver (IR2) elements on the adaptor
board (4) allow information to be optically transmitted

between the gaming machine and the data terminal (5),
both being provided to carry means for connection to the

associated elements, respectively control means (1) and

data terminal (5).
