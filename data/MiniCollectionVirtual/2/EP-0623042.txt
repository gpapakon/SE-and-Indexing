<ABSTRACT>
A highly energy efficient process for removing hydrocarbons from polymer slurries is disclosed. The process includes feeding a hydrocarbon-containing polymer slurry to a flash tank to flash a portion of the hydrocarbon from the slurry. Thereafter, the resulting slurry is fed to a fluid bed dryer wherein additional hydrocarbon is stripped from the polymer. Subsequently, the resulting polymer powder is transferred to a powder silo wherein further hydrocarbon is removed from the polymer utilizing a heated purge gas flowing countercurrent to the polymer powder. The polymer output preferably has a low hydrocarbon content, on the order of 100 ppm or less.

<DESCRIPTION>
 PROCESS FOR REMOVING HYDROCARBONS FROM POLYMER SLURRIESThe present invention is directed to a process for reducing hydrocarbon emissions, and more particularly to an energy efficient process for removing hydrocarbons from polymer slurries.The production of solid polymer particles which are suitable for pelletization and use in subsequent manufacturing processes may be accomplished by any one of many known polymerization techniques in a polymerization reactor. In such processes, the polymer slurry effluent from the reactor typically consists of the particulate polymer formed in the reactor suspended in liquid hydrocarbon diluent, which acts as the polymerization reaction medium. The diluent may be an inert solvent or excess monomer or comonomer. As an example, when ethylene is polymerized in a hydrocarbon diluent such as isobutane under controlled temperature and pressure conditions, a slurry of polymer solids and diluent is formed. This type of process is known as particle form polymerization. One drawback of this kind of process, or any process in which a polymer is prepared in solution and subsequently precipitated to form a slurry, is that the solid polymer must be separated from the liquid portion of the slurry. This liquid portion may include any suitable solvent(s) (diluent) utilized in the particular polymerization process (typically these are C3-Ca hydrocarbons) and/or 

unpolymerized monomer or comonomer, all of which will be hereinafter referred to collectively as "hydrocarbon." The term "hydrocarbon" is not intended to include the polymer itself. In certain polymer recovery processes, which are known as "wet" processes, water is added to the polymer slurry as it exits the reactor to facilitate pumping the slurry through the polymer recovery system. Such methods and apparatus may require additional energy expenditures, however, since the water initially added to the slurry must subsequently be removed.In other conventional polymer recovery processes, which are known as "dry" processes, no water is added to the polymer slurry. In an example of a conventional dry process, polymer slurry from a polymerization reactor is fed to a flash tank operated at low pressure (on the order of 1-2 psig) to flash a portion of the hydrocarbon therefrom. Recovery of the flashed hydrocarbon vapor , typically requires recompression prior to recovery. The recompression of the vapor is an energy intensive step which adds significantly to the energy consumption and cost of the overall process. Subsequently, polymer
