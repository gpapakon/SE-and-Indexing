<ABSTRACT>
An operating unit for up-and-over doors comprising a portal-shaped 
frame (2) for receiving a door (3) connected to the frame by two 

upper lateral connecting rods (8) and two lower lateral wheels (9) 
guided to slide within rails (10) provided on the frame uprights, 

comprises a motorized drum (22) for winding and unwinding a 
flexible element (7) deviated by a roller (30) located at the centre 

of the frame lintel and by a roller (31) fixed to the centre of 
the upper edge of the door in a position projecting from the 

inside of the door, said flexible element dividing into two ropes 
(29) extending symmetrically between two pairs of deviation 

members (45,46) positioned in the lower region of the door, and a pair of 
eyelets (47) fixed to the sides of the door sill.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to
an operating
unit for up-and-over doors according to the preamble of claim 1.For closing non-habitational rooms such as garages, it has been
known for some time to generally use up-and-over doors.These basically comprise a flat element forming the actual door
and a respective portal-shaped receiving frame to be fixed to the
room access aperture.In addition the door lateral edges are provided at a certain
distance from the bottom with two opposing coaxial wheels of
horizontal axis which are received in longitudinal guides provided
on the frame uprights, these lateral edges being connected, at a
certain distance from the upper edge, to said uprights by means of
connecting rods.Said uprights are usually in the form of box members provided
upperly with pulleys for deviating two cables which at one end are
connected to a counterweight and at their other end are connected
to the door lateral edge in proximity to or in correspondence with
said wheel.In some cases the counterweight is replaced by a spring, said
counterweight or spring tending to force the lower part of the
door upwards into its open position.Finally, such up-and-over doors can be of manual closing/opening 
type or of automatic operation, to which latter the invention
relates in particular.Automatically operating up-and-over doors are known, operated by a
geared motor unit with two directions of rotation, which in some
cases is fixed onto the inner face of the door whereas in other
cases it is fixed to the ceiling of the room (such as a garage).Between said geared motor unit and door there are interposed rigid
connection means which have to be fixed onto the door and/or
ceiling as necessary.At this point it should be noted that the installation of manually
operated up-and-over doors is long-standing whereas the
installation of automatically operated up-and-over doors is
relatively recent.Consequently a large number of already mounted up-and-over doors
exists which could potentially be converted from manual to
automatic.However, known operating devices are little suitable for said
potential conversion because in addition to being relatively
complicated and costly, they are relatively complex to mount and
once installed cannot be recovered.Specifically, said mounting complexity is due to the means which
have to be interposed between the geared motor unit and the door,
requiring substantial structural modification of the door (such as
in the devices the geared motor unit of which is fixed to this
latter), and a relatively

<CLAIMS>
An operating unit for up-and-over doors comprising a
portal-shaped frame (2) for receiving a door (3) connected to the

frame by two upper lateral connecting rods (8) and two lower
lateral wheels (9) guided to slide within rails (10) provided on

the frame uprights, characterised by comprising a motorized drum
(22) for winding and unwinding a flexible element deviated by a

roller (30) located at the centre of the frame lintel and by a
roller (31) fixed to the centre of the upper edge of the door in a

position projecting from the inside of the door, said flexible
element dividing into two ropes (29) extending symmetrically

between two pairs of deviation members positioned in the lower
region of the door, and a pair of eyelets (47) fixed to the sides

of the door sill.
A unit as claimed in claim 1, characterised in that said
flexible element consists of a band of woven material, said two

ropes (29) consisting of the two branches of a cord of synthetic
material freely threaded through a connection element (28)

provided at the free end of said band.
A unit as claimed in claim 1, characterised in that said
roller (31) positioned at the centre of the upper edge of the door

projects above said upper edge.
A unit as claimed in claim 1, characterised by comprising
an elastically deformable member (42) to be fixed to the centre of

the upper edge of the door, and which when in the rest position
extends above the outer face of the door to rest against the frame

(2) on termination of closure.
A unit as claimed in claim 1, characterised in that each
of said pairs of deviation members consists of two small pulleys

(45) and (46) having their axes perpendicular to the door (3), and
of which the first (45) is fixed to the centre of the door lower

edge, whereas the second (46) is fixed to the lower part of the 
corresponding lateral edge of said door.
A unit as claimed in claims 1 and 5, characterised in that
said roller (30) located at the centre of the lintel, or said pair

of pulleys (45), is located on a fixing element by way of means
enabling the flexible element (7) to be released by remote

control.
A unit as claimed in claim 6, characterised in that said
release means consist of an elastically opposed pull-release cable

(38).
A unit as claimed in claim 1, characterised in that the
electrical power circuit (19) for the unit (17, 18) operating said

drum (22) is provided with a rechargeable storage battery (20)
able to power said unit in case of temporary lack of mains

voltage.
