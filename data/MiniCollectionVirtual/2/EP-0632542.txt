<ABSTRACT>
A latching device (10) for a card edge connector (30) 
and auxiliary board (60) having a first arm (12) and a 

second arm (14), wherein the second arm includes a 
latching unit (20) and a latching release unit (26), when 

the latching device (10) is inserted into a receptacle 
compartment (46) in the connector (30), the first arm (12) 

resiles toward the second arm for fixing the latching 
device (10) in the receptacle compartment. The latching 

unit (20) includes round shoulders (22, 24) which are 
provided to fit into round recesses (62) of an auxiliary 

board (60). A directed pressure (A, B, C) placed on the 
release unit (26) causes the latching unit (20) to rotate 

away from an area in card edge connector (30) where an 
auxiliary board is disposed.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to latching devices and card
edge connectors in which such devices are used, and
especially relates to a card edge connector to be mounted on a
mother board in parallel therewith and having at least one
latching device for latching an auxiliary board to be electrically
connected to the mother board.Card edge connectors are widely used in personal
computers and other electronic equipment for the
connection of SIMMs (single in-line memory modules) and
other similar electronic components to a mother board. In
order to prevent such electronic elements from being
disconnected from the base board during operation, these
card edge connectors are usually equipped with latching
devices. Fig. 8 represents an example of such a latching
device (Japanese Patent (1991)-108286). This latching
device 100, made in a roughly U-shaped configuration, has
two arms: 102 and 104, with the arm 104 being equipped
with a latching unit 106 and a latching release unit 108.
The axis of this latching device 100 is perpendicular to
the mother board (not shown in the drawing) and it is
arranged inside the connector housing (not shown in the
drawing). The release of the latching between the board
with the auxiliary board (not shown in the drawing) and
the latching unit 106 is carried out either by directly
operating the latch 106 or by pressing the inclined
surface of the latch release unit 108 downward either by
a tool or by a finger.The latching device described above is effective when
it is used with a card edge connector retaining the
auxiliary board in a position approximately perpendicular
to the mother board. However, if the auxiliary board is
used in connectors which are practically parallel to the
mother board for the purposes of compactness, the
following problems arise. Since the direction of latch 
release is approximately parallel to the mother board (or
to the auxiliary board), the latching release operation
becomes very difficult, especially if the card edge
connector is made in a low-profile configuration. In
addition, it looks like it is easy to-release the latch by
pressing the inclined surface of the latching unit 106,
but if the pressure is applied directly to the latching
unit 106, the latching between the auxiliary board and the
latching unit 106 becomes even stronger, and in fact the
release can not be easily achieved.From document US-A-5,112,242 a card edge connector to be mounted
on a mother board having a latch device for a memory module board
has come to be known. Said latch device has

<CLAIMS>
A card edge connector (30) to be mounted on a mother board in
parallel therewith and having at least one latching device (10) for

latching an auxiliary board (60) to be electrically connected to the
mother board,


a) said latching device (10) having first and second arms (12, 14)
in generally V-shape before being inserted into a receptacle

compartment (46) of a housing (40) of said card edge connector
(30)
b) with said first arm (12) having a retention section (16) to retain
said latch device (10) in the receptacle compartment (46) and
c) said second arm (14) having a latching unit (20) and a latching
release unit (26),
d) said first arm (12) residing toward said second arm (14) when
said latching device (10) is inserted into the receptacle compartment

(46),
e) said latching unit (20) being formed at substantially middle
portion of said second arm (14) at the upper edge thereof; and
f) said latching release unit (26) being formed at the free end of
said second arm (14) extending generally upwardly from the

upper edge thereof so that a torsional motion is applied to said
second arm (14) when operating said latching device (10).
The card edge connector of claim 1, wherein said first arm (12) has
a fixing arm (18) to be fixed on the mother board.
The card edge connector of claim 1 or 2, wherein said latching unit
(20) has generally arcuate shoulders (22, 24). 
The card edge connector of claim 1, wherein said latching unit (20)
and said latching release unit (26) are offset with each other with

respect to said second arm (14).
