<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to the optical transmission of information and,
more particularly, to improving transmission capabilities over long-distance optical
transmission paths employing repeaters.Very long optical fiber transmission paths, such as those employed in
undersea or trans-continental terrestrial lightwave transmission systems including
optical-amplifier repeaters, are subject to decreased performance caused by a host of
possible impairments. The impairments typically increase as a function of the length
of the optical transmission. In long optical transmission paths that include optical
amplifiers, the impairments tend to vary with time and cause a random fluctuation in
the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of the optical transmission path. The random
fluctuation in SNR contributes to a phenomenon known as signal fading. The SNR
fluctuations also result in an increased average bit error ratio (BER) in digital signals
being transmitted over the optical transmission path. When the SNR of a digital
signal being transported on such an optical transmission path becomes unacceptably
small relative to the average SNR (resulting in an undesirably high BER), a signal-to-noise
fade is said to have occurred. Experimental evidence has shown that the
signal fading and SNR fluctuations are caused by a number of polarization dependent
effects induced by the optical fiber itself and/or other optical components within the
transmission path. In particular, one of these effects has now been identified as
polarization dependent hole burning (PDHB), which is related to the population
inversion dynamics of the optical amplifiers. A discussion of hole-burning can be
found in an article by D. W. Douglas, R. A. Haas, W.F. Krupke and MJ. Weber,
entitled "Spectral and Polarization Hole Burning in Neodymium Glass Lasers";
IEEE Journal of Quantum Electronics, Vol. QE-19, No. 11, November 1983.PDHB reduces gain of the optical amplifiers within the long optical
transmission path for any signal having a state of polarization ("SOP") parallel to
that of a polarized primary optical signal carried by the transmission path. However,
the gain provided by these amplifiers for optical signals which have an SOP
orthogonal to that of the primary signal remains relatively unaffected. In simplified 
terms, the primary optical signal produces an anisotropic saturation of the amplifier
that is dependent upon the SOP of the primary optical signal. The polarized primary
signal reduces the level of population inversion anisotropically within the
