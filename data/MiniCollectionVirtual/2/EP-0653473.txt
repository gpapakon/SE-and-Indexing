<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a process for making apertures by drilling or sawing in hollow ceilings, hollow floors or cavity walls of concrete, stone, ceramic or the like, using a drilling or sawing element (6) which is cooled by a fluid coolant. The coolant (13) used is a solution in water of a thixotropic agent (14) which is present in the water in a quantity such that the solution behaves thixotropically. The thixotropic agent employed is Dehydril

<CLAIMS>
A method of forming through openings by drilling or
sawing in cavity ceilings or walls of concrete, brick,

ceramic or the like, using a drilling or sawing element (6)
requiring cooling by means of a fluid coolant,

characterized in

that the coolant (13) used is water with the thixotropicising
agent (14) dissolved therein in a quantity in the

water such that the solution behaves thixotropically.
A method according to claim 1, characterized in that
a silicate based thixotropicising agent is used.
A method according to claims 1 and 2, characterized
in that the thixotropicising agent Dehydril*
 HT is used in a
0.1 to 20 % by weight, preferably 0.4 to 1 % by weight

solution in water.
