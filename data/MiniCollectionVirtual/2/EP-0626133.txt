<ABSTRACT>
A feeding device for poultry comprises a dish-shaped 
pan (2), above which a feed drop tube (12) is centrally 

arranged. The upper end of the feed drop tube (12) is 
adapted to be in open connection with a feed supply tube 

(10) of a feed supply system. Between the feed drop tube 
(12) and the pan (2) a plurality of support arms (6) is 

present which are connected to a rim (4) of the pan by 
means of a snap connection with two transverse arms (46) 

extending along the rim (4) of the pan (2) and having hook 
lugs (48) and a supporting lip (44). Connecting means for 

connecting the pan with the feed supply tube (10) consist 
of two yoke parts (24, 32) which, together, can enclose the 

feed supply tube, the first yoke part (24) having two yoke 
arms (26) with hook parts (28) directed towards each other 

for enclosing the second yoke part (32).

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a feeding device for poultry, 
in particular turkeys, comprising: a substantially dish-shaped 
pan, a feed drop tube arranged centrally above the 
pan and having a vertically directed centre line, the upper 
end of the feed drop tube being adapted to be in open 
connection with a horizontal feed supply tube of a feed 
supply system, and the lower end thereof being open and 
extending above the pan; and connecting means for 
connecting the pan with the feed supply tube, which 
connecting means comprise support arms extending to the 
pan. Such a feeding device is, for example, known from GB-A 
1 426 651, and is generally used for feeding poultry during 
a time period during which the animals become larger, 
heavier and stronger. For young animals the feeding device 
connected with the feed supply tube of the feed supply 
system is arranged on the ground for a good accessibility 
of the feed, and the feeding device will in the course of 
time, when the animals have grown sufficiently, be 
suspended from the feed supply tube above the ground. 
During feeding the birds being present around a feeding 
device will exert forces on the feeding device, which 
forces will be larger as the weight and strength of the 
birds increase, which forces should be taken up by the 
device. In particular the connection between the feeding 
device and the feed supply tube and between the pan and the 
remaining part of the feeding device will be exposed to 
risks. When the feeding device is suspended above the 
ground, the first-mentioned connection is, moreover, 
exposed to wear by the oscillating movement of the device 
around the feed supply tube of the feeding system. Very 
heavely loaded feeding devices of the above-mentioned kind, 
such as feeding devices for turkeys, have therefore, in the 
past, been constructed mainly from metal. Metallic feeding 
devices, however, have the objection that they have a large 
intrinsic weight, so that the over-all feeding system  
 
should be made heavy, and furthermore corrosion will occur, 
so that the feeding devices have a restricted life. It is an object of the invention to provide a feeding 
device in which the above-mentioned objections have been 
reduced, which device can be made wholly or substantially 
of plastics, and is sufficiently strong for withstanding 
the forces exerted thereon by heavy birds such as turkeys. The device according to the invention is, therefore, 
characterised in that the support arms at their ends 
directed towards the pan, are
