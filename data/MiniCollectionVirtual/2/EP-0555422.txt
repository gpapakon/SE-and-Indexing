<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to the art of energy storage devices such as 
capacitors and batteries including electrolytic capacitors, ceramic capacitors, 
foil capacitors, super capacitors, double layer capacitors, and aqueous and 
non-aqueous primary and secondary batteries. Even more particularly it 
relates to lithium batteries having solid cathodes and liquid organic 
electrolytes for delivering high current pulses as the preferred form of the 
invention. The improved electrode assembly of the invention can be variously 
applied to energy storage devices particular for improved operation. 
However, recent advances in implantable medical devices such as 
cardioverter/defibrillators and improved pacemakers of more complicated 
design have led to a need for batteries to power such devices. In particular, 
the ability of an implantable battery to deliver high current pulses and rapidly 
recover its open circuit voltage has become an important performance 
characteristic. The various new medical devices demand power sources 
with high capacity, low self - discharge and good pulsing behavior. This 
invention is particularly applicable to the need. It is then a primary purpose of the subject invention to provide an 
improved electrode assembly for high reliability electrochemical cells to be 
used as implantable power source for electrically operated medical devices. 
In achieving this purpose, the subject invention, 
1. simplifies cell construction; 2. provides an electrode array connected by a lower resistance 
conductor and a relatively short electrical conductor path; 3. minimizes the number of welds required for multi-electrode cells;  
 4. improves cell reliability by providing a continuous conductor 
network; 5. provides an electrode assembly which efficiently utilizes cell 
volume; 6. provides an electrode assembly with shaped profiles that conform 
to the shape of the power source container; 7. provide a simple construction method for cells with electrodes of 
varying dimensions that can conform to predetermined profile configurations. In its simplest form, one aspect of the invention consists of a single 
unitized solid conductor or bus strip with individual integrated electrode 
current collector tabs extending out along its length and folded to form an 
interleaved electrode assembly. A variety of electrode arrangements and 
assemblies are possible utilizing the basic concepts of the invention and can 
be better understood by considering the drawings and detailed description of 
the invention. It
