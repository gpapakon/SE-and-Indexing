<ABSTRACT>
An oxygen delignification method and apparatus in which a charge of heated
wood pulp is reacted with oxygen in the presence of a charge of caustic soda in

a plurality of reaction stages 28, 30 and 32 which alternate with mixing stages
22, 24 and 26 in which caustic is mixed with the wood pulp. The use of the

plurality of mixing stages reduces peak pH exposure of the wood pulp that
would otherwise occur if the charges of caustic soda and wood pulp were

mixed all at once. Moreover, the caustic soda mixed in such manner replenishes
neutralized caustic soda and ensures that the average pH level is increased

above that in conventional oxygen delignification. The increase in average pH
level favours an increase in the delignification. Effluent liquor from a reacted

wood pulp washing stage 24 is introduced into the mixing stages 22, 24 and 26
to prevent wood pulp degradation. Oxygen is mixed within the wood pulp by a

wood pulp mixer that employs coaxial perforate passageways between which
the wood pulp is retained and driven but which allow the oxygen to pass in an

inward radial direction of the passageways to mix with the wood pulp.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an oxygen delignification method and apparatus 
in which wood pulp and oxygen are reacted in the presence of caustic soda 
such that the caustic soda is mixed with the wood pulp in a plurality of mixing 
stages, the wood pulp is reacted with the oxygen in a plurality of reaction 
stages located between the mixing stages and filtrate, produced from a washing 
stage, is mixed with the wood pulp in the mixing stages along with the caustic 
soda. In another aspect, the present invention relates to a wood pulp mixer 
having coaxial external, intermediate and internal passageways. The 
intermediate and internal passageways are provided with perforations sized to 
retain the wood pulp such that a gas circulated through the external, 
intermediate and internal passageways mixes with the wood pulp while the 
wood pulp is driven between the intermediate and internal passageways. In the production of paper, wood chips are treated with cooking liquor to form 
wood pulp. In order to produce an unpigmented wood pulp, lignins from the 
pulp are removed in a process known as oxygen delignification. Subsequent 
bleaching stages are used to further remove pigments from the wood pulp. 
Oxygen delignification is carried out by mixing steam with the wood pulp. 
Thereafter, caustic soda derived from oxidized white liquor is mixed with the 
wood pulp. The heated wood pulp is then reacted with the oxygen and in the 
presence of the caustic soda. These foregoing operations allow the lignin to be 
dissolved from the pulp fibre by a solvent (normally water) in a subsequent 
washing stage. After treatment with oxygen, the wood pulp is introduced into the bottom of a 
treatment tower in which the wood pulp is vertically driven and removed from 
the top. Passage of the wood pulp through this tower takes approximately one 
hour. After removal from the tower, the wood pulp, as mentioned above, is 
washed to produce a filtrate. The filtrate, is often mixed with weak black liquor 
being discharged from the initial treatment of the wood chips. The rate of delignification is dependent upon the pH during reaction of the wood 
pulp and the oxygen. The higher the pH, the greater the degree of 
delignification. This is not without limit in that a point is reached at which the 
cellulose is attacked by the caustic soda to cause degradation of the wood pulp.  In practice, a charge of wood pulp is mixed with a charge of caustic soda. The 
wood pulp is then reacted with the oxygen and during such reaction, the
