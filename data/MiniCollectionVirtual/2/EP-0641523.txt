<ABSTRACT>
An improved method of, and apparatus for, cutting 
tobacco bales. Bales of tobacco (A) are fed stepwise by feed 

means (5) through a cutting device (4), which device severs the 
bale in intervals between feed steps. The next bale (8) is 

brought into abutment with the rear face of the previous 
bale before the final severing cycle, the remaining 

portion of the first bale and the second bale being fed 
together in the next feed step such that the second bale 

is positioned for the first of the severing cycles in 
respect thereof. The subject invention provides a 

practical and simple mode of cutting tobacco bales, such 
that the cutting apparatus performs fully effectively a 

continuous cutting operation which maintains a uniform 
output of cut tobacco.

<DESCRIPTION>
The subject invention relates to a method of, and 
apparatus suitable for, cutting bales of tobacco. It is a conventional practice for tobacco leaf 
material to be packed as a compressed bale for transport 
to the cigarette manufacturing facility, the bales being 
protected by outer packaging material such, for example, 
as carton board. As a first stage in the tobacco leaf 
treatment process in the cigarette manufacturing facility 
it is a common practice, after removal of the packaging 
material, to cut a bale into slices. Proposed modes of cutting tobacco bales are disclosed 
in DE 1 068 599, DE 1 139 419, EP 095 866, EP 159 836, WO 
87/02868 and WO 91/00029. These proposals suffer from the 
fact that they are overly complex and/or lack the desired 
degree of practicability. It is an objective of the subject invention to 
provide an improved method of, and an improved apparatus 
suitable for, cutting tobacco bales. The subject invention provides a method of cutting 
bales of tobacco, wherein a first bale is fed stepwise by 
feed means through a cutting plane of a cutting device, 
which device transversely severs the first bale during 
intervals between feed steps, a second bale being, during 
the time elapsed for one or more severing cycles in 
respect of the first bale, disposed at a location remote  
 
the first bale, whereafter the second bale is brought into 
abutment with the rear face of the remaining portion of 
the first bale, and then said portion and said second bale 
are fed stepwise together by said feed means. The subject invention also provides bale cutting 
apparatus comprising bale feed means and a bale cutting 
device, said bale feed means being operable to feed bales 
stepwise through a cutting plane of said cutting device 
and said cutting device being operable to sever a bale in 
intervals between feed steps, said feed means being 
further operable, during severing cycles in respect of a 
first bale, to move a second bale from a location remote 
said first bale in a direction towards said first bale and 
to bring said second bale into abutment with the rear face 
of the remaining portion of said first bale and thereafter 
to feed said portion and said second bale stepwise 
together. Preferably, the feed means is operable to move the 
second bale into abutment with the rear face of the first 
bale prior to commencement of the final severing cycle in 
respect to the first bale and to maintain the abutment 
until the occurrence of the aforesaid feed step in which 
the said portion

<CLAIMS>
A method of cutting bales of tobacco, wherein a first 
bale is fed stepwise by feed means through a cutting 

plane of a cutting device, which device transversely 
severs the first bale during intervals between feed 

steps, a second bale being, during the time elapsed 
for one or more severing cycles in respect of the 

first bale, disposed at a location remote from the 
first bale, whereafter the second bale is brought 

into abutment with the rear face of the remaining 
portion of the first bale, and then said portion and 

said second bale are fed stepwise by said feed means. 
A method according to Claim 1, wherein the said 
abutment of the second bale with the rear face of the 

said remaining portion of the first bale is brought 
about by said feed means acting upon the second bale. 
A method according to Claim 1 or 2, wherein after 
completion of the last severing cycle in respect of 

the first bale and before the first severing cycle in 
respect of the second bale, the cutting device 

remains inactive for a period of time equivalent to 
that of a severing cycle, whereupon said second bale 

is fed forwards over a distance two times that of a 
normal feed step. 
Bale cutting apparatus comprising bale feed means and 
a bale cutting device, said bale feed means being 

operable to feed bales stepwise through a cutting  
 

plane of said cutting device and said cutting device 
being operable to sever a bale in intervals between 

feed steps, said feed means being further operable, 
during severing cycles in respect of a first bale, to 

move a second bale from a location remote said first 
bale in a direction towards said first bale and to 

bring said second bale into abutment with the rear 
face of the remaining portion of said first bale and 

thereafter to feed said portion and said second bale 
stepwise together. 
Apparatus according to Claim 4, wherein said bale 
feed means comprises pusher means. 
Apparatus according to Claim 4 or 5, wherein said 
cutting plane of said cutting device is an upwardly 

extending plane. 
Apparatus according to Claim 4, 5 or 6, wherein the 
feed path of the bales to said cutting device is 

substantially horizontal.
