<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a method of making a diamond 
coated structure, and more particularly, to a method for making a 
non-planar diamond coated optical window. Diamond has properties which make it attractive for use as 
window material or coating. Among these properties are extreme 
hardness, thermal stability, inertness, and excellent 
transmissivity of certain radiation. In recent years, a number of techniques have been developed 
for depositing synthetic diamond on surfaces of various shapes to 
obtain a diamond film or coating. These techniques include 
so-called chemical vapor deposition ("CVD") methods wherein, for 
example, a plasma of a hydrocarbon and hydrogen is used to 
deposit diamond film. It is known that materials such as zinc sulfide or zinc 
selenide can be coated with diamond to obtain a rugged infrared 
(IR) window. However, zinc sulfide and zinc selenide are  
 
relatively reactive substances, and are attacked by reactive ions 
at the high temperatures used for diamond film deposition from 
the vapor phase. A protective interlayer, such as of silicon, 
may or may not sufficiently protect the reactive material long 
enough to apply the protective layer of diamond, but involves 
additional processing and is not ideal. It is among the objects of the present invention to devise 
improved techniques for obtaining a diamond coating on a reactive 
material, such as for a non-planar optical window or dome.  The present invention solves the problem of subjecting the 
optically selective substance to high temperature associated with 
diamond film deposition, and particularly the reactive ions 
associated with the deposition process, by fabricating the 
structure in an inverted order and with the diamond deposited 
first on a form or mandrel that is concave in shape for ultimate 
obtainment of a convex optical window or dome. In accordance with an embodiment of the invention, a method 
is set forth of forming a diamond coated optical window or dome, 
comprising the following steps: providing a mandrel having a 
concave surface; depositing a diamond film on the concave surface 
by chemical vapor deposition; depositing an optically selective 
material on the diamond film; and removing the diamond film, with 
the optically selective material thereon, from the mandrel. In the disclosed embodiment of invention, the step of 
depositing diamond by chemical vapor deposition is a relatively 
high temperature process, with temperature at the deposition 
surface of at least 850 degrees C, and the
