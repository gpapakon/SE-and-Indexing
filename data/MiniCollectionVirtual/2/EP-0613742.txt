<ABSTRACT>
A process of providing a disposable core for use in die 
casting processes. A salt material is molten and cast into a core 

of a desired configuration under exacting conditions. The fluidity 
of the molten salt is controlled enabling casting the salt material 

into a core by die casting methods. The die casting method 
provides a core with a high surface finish and strength. The core 

is evenly cooled subsequent to it being cast and is maintained at 
an elevated temperature to maintain its surface finish and 

structural integrity. The cast core is inserted into the dies of 
a metal die casting machine to facilitate casting a metal product 

having internal forms not otherwise attainable. The core is 
removed from the metal product by simply dissolving and flushing 

the core out of the casting. The salt material may be reclaimed by 
a de-salination process for further use.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to the production of cores 
for producing internal passages or cavities in a die casting 
process and to die casting processes using the cores. Internal passages are not commonly provided in products 
produced by a die casting process. Casting an internal passage 
requires the use of a core produced from a material that can be 
removed from the cast product without damaging the product. Sand 
and foam are common materials used for making cores. Sand is 
removed by demolishing it and foam is removed by burning. However, 
neither is considered suitable for die casting. The die casting 
process subjects the cores to high pressures during the fill 
process that are typically beyond that which can be withstood by 
sand and foam cores. Sand cores are also difficult to demolish and 
the destructions of foam produces toxic contaminants that are 
environmentally undesirable. Accordingly, die casting is most commonly achieved without the 
production of internal passages or cavities. Products produced by 
die casting that have internal passages require follow-up 
processes. More often such products are produced by methods other 
than die casting. An alternative material was developed some years ago as having  
 
properties desirable for producing cores for casting. This 
material has a salt base (soda ash or perhaps more accurately an 
ionic compound) that is dissolvable in water but in a dry state can 
be provided in powder-like form. The dry powder form can be melted 
into a liquid or molten state, poured into a mold and cooled to a 
solid state. That is, the core is produced by "casting" the 
desired core shape and the core produced thereby is in turn used 
for the casting of a metal product requiring internal passages. 
Such a core can be inserted into a casting mold, and following the 
casting process, it can be simply washed out of the product to 
leave the internal passages or cavities. Such a material is 
available from Park Chemical Company of Detroit, Michigan and the 
material is known as Aluminum Casting Salt. Hereafter this 
material is often referred to simply as casting salt but includes 
all materials having similar properties, e.g., an ionic compound 
that can be molded into a solid state and washed away with water. The problem with this material is that the casting salt cores 
previously produced with any degree of success have been produced 
by the known method of gravity flow casting. These have been found 
to be too fragile for use in die casting. Whereas the die casting

A process of producing a core to be used for forming 
a passage or cavity in a die casting process, the core being 

produced from a casting salt, the process comprising the 

steps of: 
   maintaining a vat of molten salt at a temperature that 

exceeds the melting temperature of the casting salt, 
   transferring a quantity of the molten casting salt to a 

die casting shot sleeve, 
   cooling the molten casting salt to its liquidus 

temperature to thereby increase its viscosity, and 
   transferring the casting salt in its cooled and 

liquidified form to a die casting machine for injection into 
a die casting mould. 
A process as claimed in claim 1 comprising applying 
heat to the walls of the casting mould to prevent 

solidification of the core exterior prior to solidification 
of the core interior. 
A process of producing a core to be used for forming 
a passage or cavity in a die casting process, the core being 

produced from a casting salt, the process comprising the 
steps of: 

   injecting molten die casting salt into a casting mould, 
and 

   applying heat to the walls of the casting mould to 
prevent solidification of the core exterior prior to 

solidification of the core interior. 
A process of producing a die cast metal product 
having an interior passage or cavity, the process comprising 

the steps of: 
   producing a core by the process of claim 1, 2 or 3, 

   maintaining the temperature of the core above about 
315.6°C. (600 degrees F.), 

   mounting the core to a die cast mould by press fitting 
 

it into a preformed depression in the mould, 
   injecting a molten metal into the die cast mould and 

removing the cast metal product including the core contained 
in the internal passage from the mould, and 

   removing the core from the cast metal product by 
applying liquid to convert the core material to solution and 

then washing the core out of the product. 
A process as claimed in claim 4 comprising 
reclaiming the solution of the liquid and casting salt an 

desalinating the solution to convert the salt material back 
to solid form for recycling thereof.
