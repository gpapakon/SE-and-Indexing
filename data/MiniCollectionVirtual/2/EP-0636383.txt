<ABSTRACT>
The disclosed is a method of angiography which reduces the 
burden beared by the patient due to the surgery. By 

replacing catheters and by means of brachial paracentesis, 
angiography is performed on each of coronary artery, vein 

bypass, gastroepiploic artery and internal thoracic artery, 
through the steps of: providing puncture of a paracentetic 

tube from a brachium, and, through the tube above, inserting 
a catheter selected from the following group: (a) a 

catheter of the type in use for the left and right coronary 
artery and the venous bypass; (b) a catheter of the type in 

use for the inernal thoracic artery; and (c) a catheter of 
the type in use for the gastroepiploic artery.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method of 
angiography of coronary arteries, vein bypasses, 
gastroepiploic arteries and internal thoracic arteries. In accordance with the increasing cases of percutaneous 
angiography or coronary arterial bypass surgeries, 
cases of repeating coronary arterial and bypass angiography 
have increased. Also, in the western countries, for the 
purpose of cost saving of medical expenses, there have been 
increasing cases for performing coronary artery angiography 
in outpatient sites. Conventionally, coronary artery angiography has 
employed two methods including "Judkins" method comprising 
the step of puncture of a paracentetic tube into the femoral 
artery, from which a catheter is inserted: and "Sones" 
method comprising the step of incising the skin of the 
brachial region to expose the artery, to which a hole is 
formed to be inserted by a catheter. Advantages and disadvantages of the prior art are as 
follows. In Jadkins method, performed only by puncture of a 
paracentetic tube into a blood vessel, compared to Sones 
method performed by incision of the vessel, damage of skins 
and vessels is minimized. Also, insertion of a catheter  
 
from the paracentetic tube into the blood vessel minimizes 
damage of blood vessel caused by entrance and exit of the 
catheter. Since the process is performed without incision of 
cortex and blood vessel, no wound or adhesion of wound 
region remains. Therefore, even in angiography which 
requires frequent repetition of angiographic processes, it 
is advantageously possible to repeat such processes from the 
same region. In Judkins' method, (1) the catheter used in this 
method is in advance formed to easily enter the coronary 
artery, and to be operated by a beginner through a 
relatively short term training.
 
   (2) On the other hand, one of disadvantages of 
Judkins' method is that the patient would feel ashamed 
because the catheter is inserted from the femoral region. However, because of the paracentetic tube being 
punctured, after removal of the tube, often bleeding occurs, 
and it is required a long time pressurising and laying quiet 
for hemostasis. Therefore, the patient suffers from burden.
 
   (3) For angiography of the left and right coronary 
arteries and venous bypass, a separate catheter is employed, 
respectively, and it is necessary to replace the catheter, 
thereby demanding necessary time and costs as well for 
performing angiography.
 
   (4) In most western countries, for the purpose of 
cost saving of
