<ABSTRACT>
A device for exchanging tape-reel speed adapted to a tape recorder or player which includes a driving tape disc (1) for setting a tape reel thereon, a driven tape disc (2) for setting a tape feeding reel thereon, and means for alternately supplying a torque power from a drive motor to either one of the tape discs, the supplying means having two gears (4, 5) attached to the driven and driving tape discs, a selecting gear (6) alternately intermeshed to either one of the gears, a shift member (7) for engaging the selecting gear with either one of the gears, and a torque power transmission gear (8) generally intermeshing to the selecting gear, includes a torque flexible transmission device adapted to control the torque power between the torque power transmission gear and drive motor by means of a driven gear (9), a driving member (10) and a friction member (11) rotatably disposed between the driven and driving members, a direct-transmitting gear (14) disengageably intermeshed to both of the driven and driving members, means for shifting the direct-transmitting gear so as to be carried access or far to a position for intermeshing to the driven and driving members, and means for releasing the direct-transmitting member from the intermeshing position as the electro-magnetic solenoid device (15) is disenergized.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a device for exchanging tape-reel 
speed adapted to a tape recorder such as a video tape 
recorder, a video tape player, Digital Audio Tape recorder and 
camera recorder for home or business use as well as a combination 
recorder with a television, and other visual or audio devices 
having a tape recorder or player. The prior art recorder or player with a tape winding system had 
generally included means for controlling tape-speed in a 
prescribed constant line speed according to various amounts of a 
record tape wound to a tape reel and additionally included means 
for fast-forwarding and rewinding modes. For the purpose of such 
uses, a system driving the tape-reel had been provided with a 
torque flexible transmission device as mentioned hereinafter. The torque flexible transmission device had included a 
friction member disposed between the power transmission route from 
a drive motor to a tape setting disc for winding the record tape 
to the reel set thereon, so that the friction member could be 
slided to a driven member attached to the tape setting disc or to 
a driving member attached to the side of the drive motor under the 
constant line speed of the tape for recording or replaying mode, 
and means for directly intermeshing the driven and driving members 
in each other under the fast-forwarding or rewinding mode by a 
suitable gear train so as to remove the sliding between the tape 
setting disc and drive motor. Nevertheless, the intermeshing means had unavoidably included 
a complicated construction in order to connect or release the gear 
train with or from the driven and driving members, the means 
further including an exclusive motor or an electro-magnetic 
solenoid device. An object of this invention provides a device for exchanging 
tape-reel speed according to the operating mode selected in a tape  
 
recorder or player wherein the intermeshing means can be 
constituted in a simple construction and operated in a reliable 
condition. A second object of this invention provides a device for 
exchanging tape-reel speed including means for guiding a gear to 
be directly intermeshed to both a driven member for rotating a 
tape setting disc and a driving member adapted to the side of a 
drive motor, through the driving and driven members being slidably 
intermeshed in each other through a friction member. According to the present invention, there is provided a device 
for exchanging tape-reel speed adapted to a tape recorder or 
player which includes a driving

<CLAIMS>
A device for exchanging tape-reel speed, to be applied to 
a tape recorder or a player, comprising: 


(a) a driving tape disk (1) for setting a tape reel thereon, 
(b) A driven tape disk (2) for setting a tape-feeding reel 
thereon, and 
(c) means for alternately supplying torque force from a 
drive motor to either of the tape disks,
 
said supplying means having: 
(d) two gears (4 and 5) attached to the driving and driven 
disks, respectively, 
(e) a shift gear (6) which meshes alternately with either of 
the two gears, 
(f) a shifting member (7) which makes the gear (6) mesh 
alternately with either of the two gears, 
(g) a torque-transmitting gear (8) which meshes always with 
the shift gear (6)
 
characterised by comprising: 
(h) a driven gear (9) connected coaxially with the torque-transmitting 
gear (8), 
(i) a driving gear (10) which rotates coaxially with the 
driven member, 
(j) a driven pulley (12) mounted on the driving member for 
transmitting torque force from the drive motor, 
(k) a friction member (11) disposed between the driving 
member and the driven member, 
(l) a means to urge the driven member to the driving member 
via the friction member, 
(m) a direct-transmitting gear (14) which meshes with the 
driving member and the driven member disengageably, 
(n) a guide member (19), one end thereof having a V-shaped 
guide (19A) mounted for guiding the direct-transmitting gear to 

engage and disengage with the driving member and the driven 
member, and the other end thereof connected coaxially with the  

 
driven pulley (12), 
(o) a friction member (22) installed pivotally between the 
guide member and the driven pulley, 
(p) a maintaining means provided with an electromagnetic 
solenoid device (15) which maintains meshing of the driving member 

with the driven member of the direct-transmitting gear against 
torque force which will move the guide member via the friction 

member (22). 
A device for exchanging tape-reel speed as set forth in 
Claim 1, wherein the maintaining means to maintain meshing of the 

direct-transmitting gear (14) comprises: 

(a) a pivot (16A) attached vertically to a chassis, 
(b) a bias spring (17) with one end and the other end 
thereof being attached to a lever (16) and the chassis, 

respectively, 
(c) a ferrite piece (18) of the solenoid device (15) connected 
with the one end of the lever (16) which pivotally supports the 

direct-transmitting gear (14) by the other end. 
A device for exchanging tape-reel speed as set forth in 
Claim 1 or Claim 2, wherein the guide member and the maintaining 

means are disposed and constructed so that: 

(a) in case the electromagnetic solenoid is excited (rapid 
forwarding or rewinding condition), movement of the guide member (19) 

to separate the direct-transmitting gear (14) from the driving and 
driven members along the V-shaped guide (19A), caused by torque 

force of the driven pulley (as) via the friction member (22), is 
prevented by the maintaining means, and, 
(b) in case the electromagnetic solenoid is disgaussed 
(playing or recording condition), the guide member 19 makes the 

direct-transmitting gear (14) separate from the driving and driven 
members along the V-shaped guide 19A by means of torque force of 

the driven pulley (12) via the friction member (12) against the 
maintaining means.
