<ABSTRACT>
Optical waveguide shape (11) approximated 
to a polygon is specified by 

data containing a series of points (A, B, 
..., I). To divide such an optical waveguide 

shape into trapezoids, a predetermined 
line (21) is set, and the optical 

waveguide shape (11) is divided by lines 
(41
i
), which is perpendicular to the line 
(21) and pass through the series of points. 

Two adjacent lines (41
i
, 41
i+1
) intersect 
sections of the contour line of the waveguide 

to define a trapezoid (31
i
), and the 
four corners of each trapezoid are used 

as a set of data for the trapezoid. Alternatively, 
an optical waveguide shape (11) 

approximated to a polygon is specified by 
data containing a series of points (a', b', 

..., k'). To divide such an optical waveguide 
shape into a trapezoid, a straight 

line (21) is set, and the optical waveguide 
shape is exploded into a uniaxially convexed 

polygon (51
i
) not having concaves 
in the direction of the straight line axis, 

and each of the uniaxially convex polygons 
so exploded into trapezoids.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a trapezoidal
partitioning method and apparatus for partitioning the
figure of an optical waveguide, which is approximated by
a polygon, into trapezoids. More particularly, the
invention relates to a trapezoidal partitioning method
and apparatus suitable for application to a situation in
which data indicative of the figure of an optical
waveguide is converted into data having a format suited
to a waveguide simulation, namely trapezoid-vertex data,
after which this data is output.It is not an exaggeration to say that the key to
success in future optical communications for a time of
more widespread use is how to efficiently develop
optical devices and optical circuits with desired
characteristics. To this purpose, it is necessary to
provide an environment in which design, analysis and
measurement/evaluation can be carried out
systematically.In the development of electronic devices and LSIs,
such an environment has already been provided and
separate, dedicated software for layout design,
characteristic analysis and data extraction from
prototype circuitry has already been established as a
tool. Furthermore, systems have been constructed in 
which a developer is capable of designing the desired
circuitry through an exchange of data with the tool.
These systems are flourishing at the present time.Meanwhile, attempts at simulating optical devices
and optical waveguides systematically are also being
carried out with vigor in advanced research facilities
(see T.P. Young et al., "BEAMER A Design Tool for
Integrated Optics", GEC Journal of Research, Vol. 6, No.
3, 1988). Further, easy-to-use individual tool packages
for more widespread use of optical circuits have also
begun appearing on the market. (For example, see R.
Müller-Nawrath and R. März, "A Layout Editor for
Integrated Optics", 19D2-2, IOOC '89, and M. Filoche et
al., "Alcor Version 2.1 User Manual, 1992.)US-A-5 129 051 describes a technique for decomposing any simple or complex
arbitrary polygon into a trapezoid having at least one edge parallel to the scan
direction for more efficient scan conversion by rasterization circuitry. An input
polygon is split into "slabs", which are adjacent regions bounded by lines parallel to
the scan direction. Initially the polygon is split at the y coordinate of every vertex to
define the slabs. Then, for each slab, it is determined which edges are present in
the slab and whether there are any unacceptable edge intersections. If an
unacceptable edge intersection is found in a slab, that slab
