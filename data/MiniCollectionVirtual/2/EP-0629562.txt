<ABSTRACT>
A dispensing device (10), for example for pills, tablets or 
capsules containing medicament, comprises a store part (11) and an 

operating part (12). When these are brought into engagement a rib 
(22) on part (12) enters a narrow recess (34) in part (11) and slidably 

moves operating member (33) to allow an object (40) to pass through 
outlet aperture (31) from store (11) and fall into receiving zone (20) 

in part (12). The member (33) blocks further dispensing until the 
parts have been separated and re-engaged. The movement of 

member (33) disturbs the objects to assist in orienting them for 
entry into an assembly channel (37) leading to aperture (31). An 

embodiment with a rotary operating member is described,

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to dispensing devices for objects, 
for example for pills, tablets or capsules containing 
medicament. According to this invention a device for dispensing objects 
comprises a store part for receiving objects to be dispensed, 
and a separate operating part, the store and operating parts 
being movable into and out of co-operative engagement to 
dispense an object from the store part. The object may be dispensed when the parts move into cooperative 
engagement. The operating part may be adapted to receive an object as 
the object is dispensed. The operating part may comprise an upwardly open receptacle 
which faces upwards when the object is dispensed. The store part may be adapted to confine the objects in a 
single plane. The store part may comprise a dispensing aperture, the 
operating part including a movable member blocking exit from the 
aperture when the store and operating parts are disengaged and 
movable on engagement of the parts to unblock the aperture. The movable member may be adapted, on engagement of the 
parts, to block entry into the aperture of a further object. The store part may comprise a channel for receiving objects 
in aligned orientation and communicating with the aperture. The channel may be in part defined by the movable member. The movable member may be adapted, on engagement of the 
parts, to disturb objects in the store part. The movable member may comprise two portions adapted to 
disturb the objects at different locations.  There may be means for biasing the movable member to a 
position blocking exit from the aperture. The operating part may include an operating element 
engageable with the movable member on co-operative engagement of 
the parts, the operating element entering into a recess in the 
store part. The recess may be sized and shaped to correspond closely to 
the shape of the operating element. The invention may be performed in various ways and two 
specific embodiments with possible modifications will now be 
described by way of example with reference to the accompanying 
drawings, in which: 
Fig. 1is a perspective view of a dispensing device with 
sections of the device shown separated; Fig. 2is a part section of the device in separated 
condition and viewed from one side; Fig. 3is a view similar to Fig. 2 with the sections in cooperative 
engagement; Figs. 4, 5are similar to Figs. 2, 3 but viewed from the 
other side; Figs. 6, 7are transverse sections showing the separated 
and co-operating positions; Fig. 8shows in section a further

<CLAIMS>
A device for dispensing objects comprising a store part for 
receiving objects to be dispensed, which part comprises a 

dispensing aperture; and a separate operating part, the store 
and operating parts being movable into and out of co-operative 

engagement to dispense an object from the store part, the 
operating part including a movable member blocking exit from the 

aperture when the store and operating parts are disengaged and 
movable on engagement of the parts to unblock the aperture. 
A device as claimed in Claim 1, in which the operating part 
is an upwardly open receptacle which faces upwards when the 

object is dispensed, and is adapted to receive an object as the 
object is dispensed. 
A device as claimed in Claim 1, in which the store part is 
adapted to confine the objects in a single plane. 
A device as claimed in Claim 1, in which the movable member 
is adapted, on engagement of the parts, to block entry into the 

aperture of a further object. 
A device as claimed in Claim 1, in which the store part 
comprises a channel in part defined by the movable member for 

receiving objects in aligned orientation and communicating with 
the aperture. 
A device as claimed in Claim 1, in which the movable member 
is adapted, on engagement of the parts, to disturb objects in 

the store part, optionally at different locations. 
A device as claimed in any of Claim 1, including means for 
biasing the movable member to a position blocking exit from the 

aperture. 
A device as claimed in Claim 1, in which the operating part 
includes an operating element engageable with the movable member 

on co-operative engagement of the parts, the operating element 
entering into a recess in the store part. 
A device as claimed in Claim 8, in which the recess is 
sized and shaped to correspond closely to the shape of the 

operating element. 
A device for dispensing objects substantially as 
hereinbefore described with reference to and as shown in the 

accompanying drawings.
