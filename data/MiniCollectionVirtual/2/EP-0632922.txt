Device (1,6,13,14) for reproducing high fidelity 
sound of a cinema film with a sound-track whilst this film 

is being projected, comprising: 

a system (6) for reading the sound on a medium (7) 
other than the film, 
a system for broadcasting (1) the sound, 
a buffer memory, 
a first address pointer (18) whereby a memory 
compartment which is to receive the sound to be stored can 

be distinguished as the sound is being stored in memory 
compartments of the buffer memory (13), 
a second address pointer (19) whereby a memory 
compartment in which each sound to be transmitted is 

located can be re-located when the buffer memory (13) is 
read, 
a third pointer (17) for pointing on the medium in 
succession to successive sounds to be sampled and which 

have to be stored in the buffer memory (13), and 
a management system (14) for coordinating the three 
pointers (17, 18, 19), 
 
   characterised i
n that it comprises: 

a circuit for shifting the third pointer as a 
function of a succession of projected images of the film 

and for measuring a shift resulting from this succession of 
projected images throughout this projection, 
means (26, 27) for causing the third pointer (17) to 
skip such that, by passing over the succession of images, 

it addresses a next sound to be sampled on the medium (7) 
if this skip has to be greater than a predetermined 

threshold. 
Device as claimed in claim 1, characterised in 
that it comprises: 


means (28) for compressing this said sound,  
 
means for storing in the buffer memory in compressed 
form the sound read from the medium (7), 
means (29) for decompressing the sound stored in the 
memory (13) in order to emit it, 
a management system (14) for managing the 
compression (28) and decompression (29) means. 
Device as claimed in any one of claims 1 to 2, 
characterised in that the compression means (28) have a 

circuit enabling the signal (31) read on the medium (7) to 
be compressed so that several sounds can be stored in a 

memory compartment of the buffer memory (13). 
Device as claimed in any one of claims 1 to 3, 
characterised in that it has compression means 28 enabling 

the sound to be stored on the medium (7) in a compressed 
form. 
Device as claimed in any one of claims 1 to 3, 
characterised in that the decompression means (29) have a 

circuit (29) enabling the contents of each memory 
compartment of the memory (13) to be progressively 

decompressed into several sounds.
