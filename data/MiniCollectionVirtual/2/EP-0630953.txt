<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an application method
for a sealant, and more particularly it relates to an re-application
method for a curable oxyalkylene polymer sealant
onto previously applied and cured oxyalkylene polymer sealant.Oxyalkylene polymers containing a silicon-containing
group comprising a silicon atom bonded to a terminal group
selected from a hydroxy group and a
hydrolyzable group (hereinafter sometimes referred to as a
reactive silicon group) and which are thereby capable of
crosslinking through siloxane bond formation are disclosed,
e.g., in U.S.Patent No.3,971,751. Representative of such
oxyalkylene polymers is a polymer of the formula:
X'3Si∼∼∼∼(oxypropylene polymer)∼∼∼∼SiX'3
wherein X' represents a hydrolyzable group such as a methoxy
group.Oxyalkylene polymers having a reactive silicon group are
cured through formation of a siloxane bond (Si-O-Si) among
polymer molecules by the action of moisture in the air and the
like at room temperature similar to room temperature curable
silicone rubbers to thereby provide a rubbery cured product.
The cured product of the oxyalkylene polymer has excellent
tensile characteristics, such as large elongation, low modulus
and high breaking strength, excellent adhesive properties, and 
excellent paintability on the surface of the cured product and
is therefore useful e.g. as sealants and adhesives.With respect to the adhesiveness of oxyalkylene polymers
having a reactive silicon group, it can be bonded to a fairly
wide range of materials by utilizing various bonding methods
and primers containing silane compounds, polyisocyanate
resins, mixtures or reaction products of both, or mixtures
with other resins. However, when bonding oxyalkylene polymers
having a reactive silicon group onto previously applied
oxyalkylene polymer having a reactive silicon group after some
period has lapsed since application of the previously applied
oxyalkylene polymer ("re-application"), a further improvement
in the prior art primer compositions is desirable from the
viewpoint of adhesiveness.The present invention has been realized in consideration
of this kind of problem inherent in the prior art, and
accordingly, an object of the present invention is to provide
a method which is excellent for re-application purposes.In accomplishing the foregoing and related objects, the
present invention provides a method for applying a curable
sealant composition comprising:
providing an applied and cured sealant composition
comprising an oxyalkylene polymer having at least one
