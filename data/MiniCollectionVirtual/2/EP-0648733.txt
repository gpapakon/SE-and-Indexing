<ABSTRACT>
Process for transesterification of dimethyl succinylsuccinate using one or more aliphatic alcohols, which in each case have at least 2 C atoms, in the presence of an acidic catalyst with or without the presence of a diluent which is inert under the reaction conditions, with exclusion of oxygen and under pressure, at least one of the two methoxy groups being replaced by the oxy group corresponding to the alcohol used, and use of the process in a process for preparation of terephthalic acid and of quinacridones.
