<ABSTRACT>
The saw blade comprises a non-cutting blade region (2) whose thickness D is smaller than the cutting width S of its cutting region (4). The non-cutting blade region (2) is provided on both sides with a thin surface coating (11) of a relatively soft, biologically neutral noble metal. This results in significantly superior separating properties and in reduced friction. The saw blade is especially suitable for bone surgery.

<CLAIMS>
A saw blade for oscillatingly or rotatingly designed
separating cuts with a cutting region, with a non-cutting blade

region and with a mounting region, in particular with saw teeth
as a cutting region and for application in bone surgery, wherein

the thickness D of the saw blade (1, 10) in the non-cutting blade
region (2) at least at locations is smaller than the width of cut

S of the cutting region (4), and in the non-cutting blade region
both sides of the saw blade at least at locations have a surface

coating (11) of a biologically neutral precious metal and wherein
the precious metal coating (11) is softer than the blade

substrate material (14).
A saw blade according to claim 1, characterised in that the
surface coating (11) optically differentiates itself from the

blade substrate material (14).
A saw blade according to claim 1, characterised in that the
surface coating (11) covers the whole non-cutting blade region

(2) and that the cutting region (4) is not covered.
A saw blade according to claim 1, characterised in that
tooth tips (6) as a cutting region have a larger material

thickness (S1) than the connecting non-cutting blade region
including the surface coating (D).
A saw blade according to claim 1, characterised in that in
the non-cutting blade region there are provided closed recesses

(18) and that the surface coating from the cutting tooth-region
at least reaches up to the recesses.
A saw blade according to claim 1, characterised by a vacuum
coated precious metal surface.
A saw blade according to claim 1, characterised by a
galvanically deposited precious metal surface layer.
A saw blade according to claim 1, characterised in that the 
surface coating is matt.
A saw blade according to claim 1, characterised in that the
average thickness of the precious metal coating is smaller than

1 Âµ.
A saw blade according to claim 1, characterised in that the
thickness of the precious metal coating is between 10 and 100 nm.
A saw tooth according to one of the preceding claims,
characterised in that the precious metal layer consists of gold.
A saw tooth according to claim 1, characterised in that the
precious metal layer consists of platinum.
A saw tooth according to claim 1, characterised in that the
thickness of the precious metal coating is dimensioned such that

as a result of wear of the coating by use naked locations (24)
of the substrate material are clearly visible when the cutting

region (4) begins to blunten.
A method for manufacturing a saw blade according to claim
1, wherein for shaping by way of an etching process blade

material is removed and subsequently the precious metal surface
layer (11) is galvanically deposited.
