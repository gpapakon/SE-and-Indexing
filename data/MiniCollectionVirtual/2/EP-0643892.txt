<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to data transfer method for an actuator system operating in an interfering environment. According to the method a basic unit (30) communicates with at least one actuator (31) through a bus (33, 32). According to the invention the basic unit (30) forms on the bus (32) a continuous clock signal of essentially constant frequency, the basic unit (30) maintains a data register comprising the memory locations for storing of data, information used in communication is divided into bytes of fixed length containing the address data (ADDR) of the register of the basic unit (30), and a data item (DATA), and the actuator (30, 31) recognizes an information byte on basis of its data register address (ADDR). In an advantageous embodiment of the invention each byte to be sent is reduplicated.

<DESCRIPTION>
The object of the invention is a data transfer method according to the preamble of
claim 1 for an actuator system operating in an environment subjected to interferences.In industrial establishments data transfer is traditionally implemented by using different
bus structures for masses of data of various sizes. For surveillance of delivery of
goods and for business administration one makes use of a fast data transfer bus, which
transfers data in large blocks by using a complicated data transfer structure to verify
correctness of transferred data. Since data is transferred in large blocks, data transfer
rate in bytes per second is high, but for data transfer needed for real-time process
control containing less data this bus structure is disadvantageous, as fast dispatching
of a short message on such a bus is difficult. Nor is such a bus designed for demanding
process conditions.Below the main bus there is often built a process bus through which the process
stations communicate with each other. The bus is able for fast data transfer, but
conducting this bus to individual electromechanical actuators is not economically
feasible. Nor is this bus designed for often extremely interfering process conditions.The I2C bus of PhilipsÂ® can be used for control of actuators in process applications. In
this solution the clock pulse is not all the time on. The length of the data block varies
always according to data contents, and the data block always contains the address of a
slave unit. In this bus solution the slowest actuators may slow down the data transfer
rate. This solution is originally designed for internal data transfer of a device, and
hence the data structure does not optimally apply to an interfering process environment.
Because of changing block length, among other things, this bus solution is subject
to interference, and when slow process devices are connected to a network the speed
of the system is not sufficient in all conditions. The data transfer format also causes
limitations for data transfer rate. The document WO-A-89 08958 discloses a system for transferring
primary information between a plurality of transmitters and receivers connected to a
common communication line, but no measures are disclosed to use this system in
extremely interfering process conditions. It is the purpose of this invention to eliminate the deficiencies of the techniques
described above and to provide a data transfer method of quite a novel type for an
actuator system operating in an environment subjected to

<CLAIMS>
A data transfer method for an actuator system operating in an
environment subjected to interferences, said method comprising a step of


communicating by a basic unit (30) with at least one auxiliary unit (31)
through a bus (33,32),

and characterized in that the method further comprises the following steps :
forming on the bus (32) by the basic unit (30) a continuous clock signal
of essentially constant frequency,
maintaining by the basic unit (30) a data register, which comprises the
memory locations for storing data,
dividing the information used in communication into blocks of fixed
length containing the address data (ADDR) of the register of the

basic unit (30) and a data item (DATA),
duplicating each bit to be sent, and
recognizing by the basic unit (30,31) an information block on the basis of
its data register address (ADDR).
The method according to claim 1, characterized in that the information block is
formed of a start character (START), a five-bit data register address

(ADDR0,ADDR4), an eight-bit data (DATA0-DATA7), a parity (PARITY), and an
acknowledgement (CHECK).
The method according to claim 2, characterized in that the state of the start
character (START) is changed from zero to one during the first clock period.
