<ABSTRACT>
A connection contact in a single piece has two insulation displacement contacts (14) having each an insulation displacement slot (16), a contact and guiding surface (20) and a shearing element. The connection contact further has two contact legs (22, 23) one end of which is connected to an insulation displacement contact (14), a home contact formed between the free ends of the contact legs and a section (27) that links the insulation displacement contacts (14). The disclosed connection contact in a single piece is characterized in that the linking section (27) is designed as a substantially U-shaped loop (28). As lead-shearing element, an insulation displacement contact (14) is associated to each leg (30) of the U- or V-shaped loop (28), so that the contact pressure between the contact legs of the home contact can be easily adjusted as desired. A fatigue-proof home contact is thus obtained, which is also economical to produce.

<CLAIMS>
One-piece terminal contact with two insulation 
displacement contacts (14) which each include an insulation 

displacement contact slot (16), a contact and guide surface 
(20) and also a shearing element, with 


two contact arms (22, 23) which at one end are each 
connected to one insulation displacement contact (14), 
a normally closed contact (24) formed between the free 
ends of the contact arms, and 
a section (27) connecting the insulation displacement 
contacts (14),
 
characterised in that the connecting section (27) is 

constructed in the form of an essentially U-shaped or 
V-shaped loop (28), wherein 
one arm (30) of the U-shaped or V-shaped loop (28) is 
arranged as the shearing element for a core after an 

insulation displacement contact (14). 
Terminal contact according to claim 1, characterised in 
that it consists of a main portion (12) from which the 

contact arms (22, 23) and the insulation displacement 
contacts (14) are bent at right angles. 
Terminal contact according to claim 1, characterised in 
that the main portion (12) is provided with two recesses 

(17) which facilitate bending of the insulation 
displacement contacts (14). 
Terminal contact according to claim 1, characterised in 
that the loop (28) is constructed at least partially with 

sharp edges. 
Terminal contact according to claim 1, characterised in 
that at least one contact arm (22) is constructed with a 

contacting bead (26).  
 
Terminal contact according to claim 1, characterised in 
that the connecting section (27) is provided with two 

notches (29).
