<ABSTRACT>
The object of the invention is to perform an automatic decomposition of a 
packet switching network in backbone nodes and subareas nodes to speed up 

the routing path search without degrading the optimization criterion of the 
routing algorithm and without generating additional control messages on the 

network. 
Currently, routing algorithms compute all the available paths in the network, 
from the source node to the destination node before to select an optimal route. 

However, networks are rarely fully meshed. They are usually built around a 
hierarchical structure : a set of nodes, interconnected by high throughput lines, 

are used to build a backbone with a high degree of meshing and then, local 
nodes are grouped in geographical subareas themselves attached to the backbone. 

Routing algorithms can take advantage of this particular network 
topology to drastically reduce the complexity of paths computation. For a 

given connection, only a limited number of nodes are defined as usable and are 
taken in account by the algorithm in its path calculation.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a high speed transmission
system in a large packet switching network and, more
particularly, to an apparatus and method for speeding up the
path selection between a source and a destination node by
means of an automatic decomposition of the network topology
into a backbone and a plurality of subareas and a
pre-selection of usable links.It has become increasingly useful to interconnect a plurality
of data processing elements by means of a packet switching
network in which data is transmitted as data assemblages
called "packets". Such networks include a plurality of
interconnected switching nodes which, in turn, are connected
to end nodes supporting data processing equipments. Such
packet networks can become quite large with an extensive
geographical distribution. In such a situation, the selection
of an efficient path between two end nodes which wish to
communicate with each other becomes of paramount importance.
Different methods are summarized by H. Nussbaumer in
Teleinformatique II (pages 92 to 117) Presses Polytechniques
Romandes 1987.Publication 8272 IEE Journal on Selected Areas in
Communications (7 October 1989 No. 8, New York, US, pages
1243-1252) entitled "Topological Analysis of Packet Networks"
(V.R. Saksena) describes an unified approach for the
topological analysis of non hierarchical and hierarchical
packet networks. The approach differs from previous approaches
in adopting an end-to-end mean delay objective and including a
variety of practical routing constrains. These include limits
on the number of paths allowed in a route, limits on the
number of hops allowed in a path, and constraints due to 
prevalent virtual circuit implementations. For a broad range
of networks, quantitative analysis based on this approach has
provided new insights into the complex relationship between
network topology and routing and delay constraints.The general problem which must be solved at the network level
is to find a path between a source and a destination node.
When the network is using datagrams, the path selection must
be done individually for each packet. For virtual circuits,
the path decision is done once only at the time of the circuit
establishment. In both cases, the choice of a routing
algorithm is not easy because 
it must satisfy a large number of often conflicting requirements. This
algorithm must be simple to implement to not complicate the nodes realization,
it must ensure a correct progress of the packets whatever the disturbance on
the network. The algorithm

A method performed in an access node (300) for
selecting a routing path in a packet switching

communication network (200) comprising a plurality of
nodes (201-208) interconnected by transmission links

characterized in that
 it comprises the
steps of:


storing data representing the network configuration in
a network topology database;
selecting a set of links which may be used in a route
to each destination node in the network, said selecting

step including the further step of decomposing the
network into set of backbone nodes and a plurality of

subarea nodes, said decomposing step including further
steps of :


retrieving data representing the network configuration
from the network topology database;
ranking all network nodes in the network as a function
of the number of links connected to the network nodes;
constructing a connectivity tree in which each node in
the network appears only once and in which the tree

origin is the highest ranked node found in the ranking
step;
classifying nodes in the network either as backbone
nodes or termination nodes, backbone nodes being all

non-termination nodes and any termination node which is
connected only to one other node, subarea nodes being

any node which is not a backbone node, subarea nodes
having the same parent being grouped into the same

subarea; 
detecting all links between each pair of subareas;
defining a path through the backbone between the pair
of subareas, the backbone path including a link to each

subarea interconnected through the highest ranked node
from the set of nodes connecting the two links;
removing from the set of backbone to subarea links, any
link in which the parent node in the subarea is not

connected to the parent in the backbone and any link to
a subarea having less than a predetermined number of

nodes;

access node and a destination node, establishing a

routing path including links from the set of links

• the links belonging to the access node subarea and the
backbone links when the destination node is located in

the backbone;
• the backbone links when both access node and
