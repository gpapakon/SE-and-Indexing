<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a novel 2-aminoethanesulfonic
acid zinc complex, to a process for
producing the same and to an anti-hepatitis agent, liver
function improving agent and anti-ulcer agent, which
individually contain the same as an active ingredient.2-Aminoethanesulfonic acid (taurine) is known to
possess liver-function protecting activity, but has weak
physiological activity.The present inventors have found that a novel 2-aminoethanesulfonic
acid zinc complex can be synthesized by
reacting 2-aminoethanesulfonic acid with an alkali agent
and zinc compound or by reacting an alkali metal salt of
2-aminoethanesulfonic acid with bis(2-aminoethanesulfonic
acid) zinc salt, and that the complex possesses marked
anti-hepatitis, liver-function improving and anti-ulcer
activities.EP-A-0206692 discloses solid or semi-solid
pharmaceutical compositions containing physiologically
acceptable zinc compounds capable of sustaining release of
zinc ions for topical application to external wounds to
enhance tissue regeneration. Exemplified zinc compounds
include zinc taurine but, unlike the complex of the present
invention, zinc taurine is water-soluble (see EP-A-0206692
at, for example, column 2, lines 35/47 and column 10, lines
22/26).The present invention relates to a 2-aminoethanesulfonic
acid zinc complex represented by the general
formula:
 
(wherein M is an alkali metal atom), to a process for
producing the said complex from 2-aminoethanesulfonic acid
and to use of the said complex as an anti-hepatitis agent,
liver-function improving agent and anti-ulcer agent.As the alkali metal atom represented by M in the
general formula (I), there may be mentioned for example
sodium and potassium. The complex of the general formula
(I) can be produced, for example, by reacting 2-aminoethanesulfonic
acid (1 mole) with an alkali agent (1 mole)
and zinc compound (0.25 mole). The said reaction, when
conducted with use of the zinc compound (0.5 mole), was
also found to give the complex (I) in the same yield.
Referring to the alkali agent, there is preferably used
alkali metal alcoholates such as sodium methylate, sodium
ethylate, potassium methylate, potassium ethylate and
potassium t-butoxide, while as the zinc compound, zinc
acetate is preferred but other zinc compounds may be
utilized. The reaction is usually carried out in a
suitable solvent such as methanol and ethanol at room
temperature or under heating for several minutes to several
hours, and after the conclusion of the reaction, the
reaction product can be
