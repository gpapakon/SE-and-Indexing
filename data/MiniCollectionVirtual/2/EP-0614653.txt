<ABSTRACT>
A fluid delivery system including a vial (2) having 
an opening for containing a dry medicament, a container 

(1) having an opening for containing a solution, upper and 
lower, pierceable plugs (12,22) for hermetically sealing 

the openings of the vial and the container, a capsule (4) 
having upper and lower ends, and a sliding member (3) 

slidably disposed in the capsule (4) and having a double-pointed 
cannula provided with upper and lower needles 

(33,34). The container (1) is slidably inserted into the 
capsule (4) from the upper open end of the capsule and the 

vial (2) can be detachably and fixedly connected to the 
lower open end of the capsule. When the container (1) is 

pushed downward, the lower needle (34) of the cannula 
firstly pierces and is inserted through the plug of the 

vial (2) so that the cannula communicates with the 
medicament vial (2) and the upper needle (33) of the 

cannula pierces the plug of the container (1) so that the 
vial (2) and the container communicate with one another 

through the cannula.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a fluid delivery
system, and more particularly, to such a fluid delivery
system including a vial for containing therein a
substance, preferably a powder, such as medicament or
drug, and a container for containing therein a fluid,
preferably a liquid, such as solution or diluent, to mix
the powder with the liquid.In hospitals or other health care facilities,
dry medicament, such as powdered medicament or freeze-dried
medicament, packaged within a container, such as a
vial, has been conventionally used in such a manner that
the medicament is mixed with or dissolved
in a solution, which is to be provided for fluid therapy.
In this case, the vial containing the medicament and
another container containing a solution or diluent are
connected to each other by means of a double-pointed
hollow needle or any other communicating pipe, so that
the solution is transferred to the vial containing the
medicament to dissolve the latter.However, such an operation requires laborious
and troublesome effort and there is a fear of
contamination because a hole for connection is formed in
the drug container in the open air.To solve such problems, a fluid delivery system
having an object of carrying out an operation in a
completely sterile condition has been proposed, such as
disclosed in JP-A-61/501129
(which corresponds to
US-A-4,583,971), JP-A-2 1277 (which corresponds to
US-A-4,936,841), and JP-A-3-37067. A
fluid storage and delivery system which cannot expect a 
complete sterile operation, but capable of optionally
selecting the combinations between the medicament and
solution and attaining a substantially sterile operation,
has been proposed, such as disclosed in Japanese
Unexamined Patent Publications (JP-A) Nos. 59-209535,
62-137056, and 2-4375, or also Japanese Examined Patent
Publications (kokoku) No. 2-26506.In the above-mentioned JP-A 61-501129, a
capsule accommodating a medicament container and a
flexible container containing a solution are connected to
each other by a tube, in such a manner that the
medicament container is mutually communicated with the
flexible container by communicating means provided in the
tube and therefore the medicament is mixed with the
solution in a sterile condition. In JP-A 2-1277,
capsule accommodating a medicament container is connected
by its connecting portion to an opening of a solution
container. The connecting portion of the capsule is
accompanied with a communicating means providing with a
means for controlling the connection order, in such a
manner
</DESCRIPTION>
<CLAIMS>
A fluid delivery system comprising

a vial (2) to contain a substance for dissolving in
a liquid, the vial (2) having an opening (21) and a first

pierceable plug member (22) providing a hermetically-sealed
closure of the vial opening (21);
a container (1) for the liquid, the container (1)
having an opening (11) and a second pierceable plug

member (12) providing a hermetically-sealed closure of
the container opening (11);
a capsule (4) having a first open end at which the
vial (2) is releasably connected and a second open end at

which the container (1) is inserted, and
a slide member (3) disposed slidably in the capsule
(4), having a double-pointed cannula with lower and upper

cannula needles (34,33) axially directed respectively
towards the first and second ends of the capsule (4);
control means being provided to control the movement
of the slide member (3);

   characterised in that

the vial (2) has an axially-fixed connection at the first
end of the capsule (4) whereas the container (1) is

inserted axially slidably at the second end, such that
when the container (1) is pushed it slides into the

capsule (4) and pushes the slide member (3) along the
capsule,

the control means being such that when the container and
vial are moved towards one another the lower cannula

needle (34) pierces the first plug member (22) of the
vial (2) to put the cannula in communication with the

vial interior before the upper cannula needle (33)
pierces the second plug member (12) of the container (1)

to put the vial interior in communication with the
container interior.
