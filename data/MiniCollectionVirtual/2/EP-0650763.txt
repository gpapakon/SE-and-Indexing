<ABSTRACT>
In order to provide a simply constructed closed-circuit grinding plant characterised as a whole by a low specific energy requirement, with a material-bed comminuting high-pressure roller press and with a sifter, the closed-circuit grinding plant being intended to make do without its own separately driven disagglomerator, hitherto considered necessary, for the disagglomeration of the roller-press scabs, it is proposed, according to the invention, to guide the fresh material, together with the scabs of the roller-press discharge, directly to the material feed orifice (15) of the disagglomerator/sifter which is a static cascade sifter (16) with two sifting-zone limiting walls which are enclosed by the shaft-like sifter housing and formed between them a sifting zone (17) and through which the sifting air flows in cross-current and which have guide plates (16a, 16b) which are inclined obliquely downwards in the direction of the discharge orifice (19) for the sifted-out coarse-material fraction (20) and which are arranged in a cascade-like or shutter-like manner, the two guide-plate walls (16a, 16b) and therefore the sifting zone located between them being arranged obliquely at an angle differing from the vertical.

<CLAIMS>
A recirculating milling installation for the milling of raw material, with a
high pressure roller press (21) with material bed crushing of the task

material and with a sieve (16), whose coarse material opening (19) is in
connection with the material output of the roller press, 
characterised in
that
 the installation is arranged such that the raw material is taken
directly to the material feed aperture (15) of the sieve with the

agglomerated particles of the roller press, which is at the same time a
static cascade sieve (16) working as a disagglomerator with two sieve

zone bordering walls enclosed by the shaft shaped sieve housing, and
forming a sieve zone (17) between them and the bordering walls of the

sieve zone through which the sieving air flows, which has cascade like or
venetian blind formed guide plates (16a, 16b) sloping downwards in the

direction of the output opening (19) for the coarse material fraction (20)
sieved out, whereby the two guide plates walls (16a, 16b) and thereby

the sieve zone lying between them are arranged to be inclined at an angle
deviating from the vertical.
A recirculating milling installation according to Claim 1, 
characterised in
that
 the take-off opening (23) of the cascade sieve (16) is in connection
with a second recirculating mill installation by the take-off for the

middling/fine material fractions (24) with a tube mill (26) and sieve (27).
A recirculating milling installation according to Claim 2, 
characterised in
that
 the cascade sieve (16) of the milling circulation with the roller press
(21) and the sieve (27) of the coupled-on milling circulation with the tube

mill (26), are assembled together into a compact building unit. 
A recirculating milling installation according to Claims 1 or Claim 2,

characterised in that
 the sieve (27) of the milling circle including the tube
mill (26) is a dynamic or a static sieve.
