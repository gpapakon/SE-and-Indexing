<ABSTRACT>
The invention is directed to an apparatus (120) and method for making an envelope from ordinary size, readily available, writing paper (10). Preferably, the apparatus is a compact desk-top size machine (220) that can be combined with any common office printer (99), such as a laser printer, or even be incorporated thereinto to form a single machine (240). The envelope is created by the apparatus by appropriate scoring (21) of fold lines (G, H, F, F'), as well as cutting the sides of the sheet of paper (A, A', B, B', D, D', E, E') to form side flaps (U, U'), for example, and the application of a suitable adhesive (9) to seal the bottom flap to the side flaps, for example, as well as the application of an adhesive (210) on the sealing flap for subsequent sealing by the user, for example, following the insertion of the typed letter, for example, into the thus created envelope.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method and
apparatus for making envelopes from ordinary size, readily
available, sheets of writing paper. In a preferred
embodiment, the apparatus can be combined with or
incorporated into a printer for printing on the paper prior
to its being made into an envelope.Most offices today are computerized, with typing done
on a computer, such as a word-processor, linked to a
printer. This considerably speeds-up the output of the
office. However, a bottleneck frequently occurs at the
stage of preparing the envelope for sending out material,
such as the mailing of a printed letter. Most printers are
not built to accept the infeed of envelopes for printing
thereof, and it becomes necessary to revert to the
typewriter for addressing the envelope. In the event that
more than a few letters must be sent, the addressing of the
envelopes can take a considerable amount of time.Presently, there are several ways in which this
problem can be overcome. These include the use of: (1)
address labels; (2) envelopes with transparent windows; and
(3) special mechanisms for feeding envelopes into the
printer.All of these methods are expensive and/or
time-consuming. A way is therefore needed to simplify the
preparation of printed envelopes and to integrate their
addressing into the computerized processes of the modern
office in a simple and inexpensive manner. Furthermore, US 4,900,391 discloses a sheet recirculating,
folding and gluing system
comprising feeding means, supporting means, folding means,
sealing means and dispensing means. The system accepts sheets
from a conventional printer, folds them,
holds them at
a wait station and then inserts them into another sheet which
is folded and glued "online" to form an envelope. However,
this system requires different sizes of sheets of papers for
the ones serving as envelopes and the ones being inserted into
the envelopes. This results from the fact that both the envelopes
and the folded sheets inserted therein are folded at
folding lines parallel to the shorter side of the rectangular
sheets. It is an object of this invention to provide a compact
desk top machine for making an envelope from ordinary size,
readily available, writing paper suitable for use with letters printed
on paper having the same size.It is a further object of this invention to provide a
compact desk top envelope making machine that can be 
combined with any common office printer such as a laser
printer.Another object of the invention is to provide a method
of making,
