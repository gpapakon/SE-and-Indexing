<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a continuous 
casting apparatus for continuously making a product 
having a long size with a predetermined cross section by 
continuously drawing molten metal while solidifying the 
molten metal in a passing-through mold and to a 
continuous rolling system integrated with the continuous 
casting apparatus. A metal sheet is usually made in such a manner 
that molten metal is first continuously cast and made to 
an ingot (sheet-shaped ingot) and then rolled. Since 
the ingot generally has a thickness of about 200 mm, 
when a metal sheet of 10 mm or less in thickness is to 
be made, many rolling processes are needed. On the 
other hand, when a continuous thin metal sheet casting 
method capable of producing a thin ingot is employed, 
the number of rolling processes can be reduced. In this 
case, however, a casting speed must be increased to 
secure an output. At the same time, when the thickness 
of an ingot is reduced, since a space through which a 
molten metal pouring nozzle for pouring molten metal 
into a mold is made small, a molten metal pouring nozzle  
 
inserting portion is devised to be enlarged. This 
technology is disclosed in, for example, DE 42 01 363, 
Japanese Patent Unexamined Publication No. 58-218353 
(1983), Japanese Patent Unexamined Publication No. 3-8541 
(1991) and the like. According to the above technology (DE 42 01 
363), since the molten metal pouring nozzle inserting 
portion is enlarged, the molten metal pouring nozzle can 
be easily inserted, so that a thin ingot can be made. 
In this technology, however, the ingot must be made to a 
predetermined configuration by three-dimensionally 
deforming a solidified shell in a mold until the molten 
metal reaches the outlet of the mold. In the process of 
the three-dimensional deformation, a tensile force and a 
compression force are applied to the outside surface and 
inside surface of the solidified shell. In particular, 
when a casting speed is increased, since the solidified 
shell is made thin and a strain speed is increased, 
there is a possibility that crack may be caused to the 
solidified shell. Further, although it is required to 
uniformly cool a wide side surface from the view point 
of the increase of a casting speed and the prevention of 
crack, the three-dimensional deformation has a problem 
difficult to cope with this requirement. Furthermore, 
there is a problem that long castings are difficult to 
be processed and maintenance is also a problem. According to Japanese Patent
