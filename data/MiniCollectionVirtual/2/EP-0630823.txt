<ABSTRACT>
A packaging container (11) made of plastic, glass, metal or the like is provided, which has an access opening which can be selectively opened or tightly closed by means of a closure (12). In order to guarantee tight closure of the access opening (15) over a long period of use, provision is made for the closure to be held, by means of a magnet device (14), in its position which closes the access opening. The packaging container may be, for example, a can which can be closed by a lid.
