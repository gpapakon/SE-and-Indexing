<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a dental cement made from a 
polymeric phosphonic acid and a glass, other metal oxide or 
cermet, to a method of making the cement and to materials for 
use in making the cement. Such cements are described in GB-A-2219289 and it would be 
desirable to increase their compressive strength and to lengthen 
their working time. According to the present invention, a cement composition 
comprises an intimately blended mixture of a water-containing 
liquid, at least 30% by weight of the composition being a 
cation-catalysed cross-linkable polymeric acid containing on 
average one phosphonic acid group per one to three backbone 
carbon atoms, such as poly(vinyl phosphonic acid) PVPA 
optionally containing poly(acrylic acid), and a metal oxide 
(e.g. ZnO) or cation-leachable surgically acceptable 
aluminosilicate (preferably fluoroaluminosilicate) glass powder 
preferably containing Si02 and Al203 in the mass proportions 
(0.6 to 3.0):1 such as (1 to 2):1, preferably (1½ to 2):1, in 
the proportions (1 minus x)g phosphonic acid: 1 to 5g glass: x g 
liquid, where x is from 0.3 to 0.7, characterised in that the 
acid has been pre-reacted in aqueous solution at elevated 
temperature with a fluoride and/or phosphate of preferably a 
divalent or trivalent metal e.g. of Zn, Sn, Mg, Ca, Al or B, or 
a mixture, e.g. ZnF2 + BPO4, preferably amounting to 2½ to 12½% 
(e.g. 4 to 8%) by weight of said acid, preferably in the 
presence of water, preferably present as solvent of the acid. The glass powder is preferably two-phase and preferably 
consists of particles substantially all of which are smaller 
than 100 microns, preferably smaller than 60 microns. If it is 
desired to reduce its reactivity with the acid, the glass powder 
may be heat-treated, for example at at least 400°C (preferably 
450 - 600°C) for at least 40 minutes (preferably at least 55  
 
minutes). While a glass rapidly quenched from a high 
temperature will usually be translucent, certain heat treatments 
yield an opaque glass, and hence an opaque cement, which may be 
acceptable in appropriate cases. The glass may alternatively be 
de-activated by washing in a dilute acid such as acetic acid, 
typically in a 2½% weight concentration for 1 hour. 
Advantageously, the glass is admixed (e.g. by grinding together) 
with boron phosphate, in a preferred amount based on the glass 
of at least 10 wt %, more preferably 12-20 wt %. In place of 
glass, MgO deactivated at at least 900°C may be used. The solvent is preferably water, and
