<ABSTRACT>
This invention involved the discovery of novel 
polymers and a process for their preparation. The 

polymers were prepared by the nucleophilic substitution, 
at room temperature, of PVC with substituted 

alkyltrialkoxysilanes, which can be cured at room 
temperature to give adhesion of PVC to hydrophilic 

substrates. These polymers are particularly useful as 
adhesion promoters in ion-selective electrodes. The 

invention also involved the application of these adhesive 
primers to planar electrode substrates to give greatly 

improved performance in the response of ion-selective 
electrodes.

<DESCRIPTION>
The reaction of nucleophiles with polyvinylchloride
(PVC) is known. (Ma, S.C. et al, Anal. Chem. 60 (1988)
2293; Chenh, P. et al, Nat'l. Sci. Council Monthly, ROC
(1988) 8(4) (1988) 313; Biswas, Mukul et al, Indian J. of
Technol. 28 (1990) 111) However, it is not common to
derivatize PVC for most applications due to the fragility of
the polymer and the relative difficulty of the substitution
reaction. Elevated temperatures can lead to
dehydrochlorination, which is autocatalytic. The addition
of nucleophiles can also catalyze this process. The
resultant polymer degradation is also accelerated by light,
especially when it is in solution and at elevated
temperatures. The derivatization of PVC by reaction with
amines is normally carried out at high temperatures (Ma;
Chenh; Biswas) and/or in a nonsolvent, such as methanol (Ma;
Chenh). The result, in the first case, is a PVC which is
severely degraded, and, in the second case, a polymer which
is only partially derivatized. In the extreme worst case,
the nucleophile is simply entrapped in the polymer matrix,
giving rise to an apparent substitution reaction.PVC is used in a number of applications in which it is
desirable to have adhesion between the PVC and some
substrate. Generally, the adhesion is achieved by treatment
of the surface in question with a silane, such as 
dimethyldichlorosilane. (Harrison, D.J., J. Electroanal.
Chem. 202 (1986) 75; Moody, G.J. et al, Analyst 113 (1988)
1703; Petrarch Systems, "Silicon Compounds, Register and
Review" (1987) 54) In such a case, the adhesion is due to
hydrophobic interactions, not the formation of covalent
chemical bonds. The adhesion can be somewhat improved by
the use of a silane which can form hydrogen bonds with the
PVC, as these interactions are stronger than simple
hydrophobic interaction.One way to get around the fairly poor adhesion obtained
by these methods is to heat the PVC extensively, in the
presence of a binding agent, after it has been applied to
the substrate. (Chakrabarti, S. et al, U.S. Patent
4,341,686) Again, this leads to degradative
dehydrochlorination of the polymer. Also, the material
obtained by this method is not well-defined, nor is it
necessarily crosslinked throughout the polymer layer.One area where PVC adhesion is of particular importance
is in the field of ion selective electrodes (hereafter
referred to as ISEs). An integral part of these electrodes
are the membranes which contain the ion selective
components. These membranes are most often made from highly
plasticized PVC, indeed,
