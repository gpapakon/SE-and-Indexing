<ABSTRACT>
This method is intended for making a prediction on the received power characteristic in the receiving station. For this purpose, the invention provides for including the transmitting power regulation of one station and the resultant changes to be expected in the prediction of the received power to be expected at the other station. This is done in such a manner that a prediction is supplied to the automatic gain control (AGC) of the receiver from a knowledge of the transmitting power regulation data.

Method for optimizing the automatic adjustment
of an amplifier in radio receivers in a cellular mobile

radio network with base stations and mobile stations,
in the case of which


a) transmitter power control data of a first station
are transmitted to a second station and used to control

the amplifier adjustment of the receiver of the second
station, knowledge of the transmitter power control

data of the first station being used to supply a
prediction of the expected receiver power of the second

station to the automatic gain control (AGC) of the
receiver of the second station, or
b) data for controlling the amplifier adjustment of
the receiver of a second station are determined from

transmitter power control data of a first station and
are transmitted to the second station and used to

control the amplifier adjustment of the receiver of the
second station, knowledge of these data transmitted by

the first station being used to supply a prediction of
the expected receiver power of the second station to

the automatic gain control (AGC) of the receiver of the
second station.
Method according to Claim 1, characterized in
that the expected receiver power is predicted from the

mutual knowledge of data for controlling the
transmitter power of a given station and for 

controlling the transmitter power of the respectively
assigned corresponding station.
Method according to Claim 2, characterized in
that the expected receiver power is predicted from

knowledge of data which are detected and/or determined
for the purpose of controlling the transmitter power of

a given station or of the respectively assigned
corresponding station.
Method according to Claim 3, characterized in
that the data for controlling the transmitter power are

obtained from a hierarchical system comprising two
layers, this being done in such a way that in the upper

layer, which forms a closed loop comprising a base
station and a mobile station, the long-term transmitter

power P
t,ul
 of the mobile station is controlled in the
base station (long-term control), in that, in addition,

a statement on the decision-making authority of the
lower layer is made in the base station and transmitted

to the mobile station, and in that the short-term
transmitter power P
t,ul
 of the mobile station is
determined (short-term control) in the lower layer,

which constitutes a local control implemented in the
mobile station, taking account of the long-term

transmitter power determined by the base station and of
the statement on the decision-making authority of the

lower layer.
