<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to the
treatment of liquid waste water sludge after its
generation and separation from the waste liquid
and, in addition, to the processing of sludge which
is wasted or removed from a secondary oxidation
process. The invention is applicable to waste
water sludges generated by a variety of different
waste water treatments, e.g., municipal water
systems, paper manufacturing plants, plating
facilities, automobile plants, textile plants, and
plastics manufacturing plants. The term "waste
water" is used herein to generically describe waste
liquids (i.e., water or other liquids) containing
solid sludge contaminants.Commonly, waste water is treated to
remove contaminants that would otherwise prevent
reuse of the water in potable water systems or that
would contaminate receiving waters. Similarly,
other waste liquids are treated to remove
contaminants that might prevent reuse of the
liquids in industrial processes. Such contaminants
can include solid particulate matter, or dissolved
acids, metallic salts and organic alcohols, as well 
as dissolved odorous gases. In the case of solid
particulate contaminants, the contaminants are
separated out of the liquid as a sludge.Primary treatment of waste water often
involves discharging the waste water into a primary
settling tank. The water containing suspended
solids is then allowed to remain in the settling
tank for a period of time (detention time)
sufficient to permit the solid particulates to
gravitationally settle to the bottom of the tank as
a sludge. This sludge is periodically or
continuously removed from the bottom of the tank.In another type of treatment (i.e., air
flotation thickening), air bubbles are injected
into the waste water prior to its admission into a
subsequent settling tank so that the air bubbles
can attach to the solid particulates to provide a
lighter particulate condition. In the settling
tank, the lighter particulates collect on the
liquid surface, where they are skimmed off by an
overhead travelling belt-type collector as a
thickened sludge. The heavier particulates settle
to the bottom of the tank as a second separate
sludge.Sludges can also be produced in a
secondary treatment process as a by-product of an
aerobic aeration process, wherein an aeration unit
is included in aeration basins to bring gaseous air
(oxygen) into contact with the particulates. Waste
water flows into the aeration basins where it
remains for a specified detention time. The air
and incoming microorganisms are consumed by 
microorganisms
