<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a method of electrical testing of equipotential lines. With each line (L1, L2, L3, L4, L5, L6, L7) being traversed by at least two test points, at least one row of break points (Lc) separates the test points. The test points on a first side (1) of the row of break points (Lc) are grouped into a first set (E1) and the test points on the other side (2) are grouped into a second set (E2), the test points of the row of break points (Lc) belonging to the two sets (E1, E2). The electrical test is performed, in a first step, between the test points of the first set (E1) and, in a second step, between the points of the second set (E2), test points of the first set (E1) being grouped into the second set (E2), while remaining in the first set, in order to ensure continuity of the electrical test between the test points of the two sets (E1, E2). Application: electrical continuity or isolation tests, particularly of electrical switching cabinets.
