<ABSTRACT>
A tape printer capable of performing multicolor
printing and permitting an already printed tape to be

rewound for printing two line character trains, bold printing
and adding ornamental frames beside the first printed

character train. The tape printer installs therein a tape
cassette (2) in which is housed a print tape (8) and an ink

ribbon (9) formed with different colored ink portions at a set
pitch in the lengthwise direction of the print tape. An

ink ribbon take up mechanism is provided for taking up ink
ribbon that passes between a platen (25) and a print element (13)

provided external to the cassette. Tape transport mechanism
is provided for transporting the print tape (8). The tape

printer is constructed so that ink ribbon (9) and the print
tape (8) are transportable in a forward direction for printing,

and the ribbon take up mechanism stops and the platen (25) is
movable away from the printing section when the tape

transport mechanism reversely transports the print tape.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a tape printer for
printing images, such as characters and diagrams, on a
print tape.The tape printer generally includes a print element,
which includes a thermal head, a platen, a tape transport
means, and an ink ribbon take-up means. A cassette which
houses therein the print tape, which is the medium to be
printed on, and an ink ribbon, can be freely inserted into
and removed from the tape printer.A Japanese Utility Model Application Kokai No. HEI-2-56666
discloses a tape printer for printing labels and the
like on a print tape, which is a medium to be printed on.
The print tape is housed in a cassette along with an ink
ribbon. The cassette can be freely inserted into and
removed from the tape printer. The tape printer includes a
print element such as a thermal head, a platen which is
provided so as to come into contact with and separate from
the thermal head, an ink ribbon take up means, and the
like. The tape printer draws the print tape from the
cassette at an appropriate speed while printing images such
as characters and the like on the print tape based on data 
that was previously inputted to the tape printer.However, there are problems with the above-described
tape printer in that the tape printer can only transport
print tape in the direction in which the print tape is
drawn from the cassette. Therefore, after an image, formed
from characters for example, is printed following the
lengthwise direction of the print tape, the print tape can
not be rewound a predetermined distance in order to further
print ornamental accessories around the already printed
image, or to reprint over the printed image to form boldface
type, or to print another different color layer in the
widthwise direction of the print tape to form a two-leveled
image.Also, the print unit and the device for cutting the
end of printed tape are provided at positions spaced away
from each other in the direction in which the print tape is
transported. With the structure, after a printed print tape
is cut, subsequent printing to the unprinted print tape can
only be started at a position far from the cut end of the
unprinted print tape. In other words, a wasteful margin is
formed at both ends of print tapes and print tape is wastefully
consumed.Further, cassettes for use in conventional tape
printers house only one color ink ribbon. Therefore,
images, such as characters, with different colors can not 
be printed following the lengthwise direction of the print
tape.EP-A-0 473 147 discloses a tape printer
