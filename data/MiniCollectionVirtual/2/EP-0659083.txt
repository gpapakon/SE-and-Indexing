<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to using an insulin-like
growth factor-I to prevent or treat peripheral
neuropathy.Insulin like growth factor-I (IGF-I; somatomedin
C) is a member of a family of structurally and
functionally related polypeptides which also includes
insulin, and insulin like growth factors II (IGF-II) and
III (IGF-III). All of these protein factors may play a
role in neuronal development and maintenance (Recio-Pinto,
E., et al., 1988, Neurochem. Int. 12:397-414). In
addition, there is evidence that the levels of IGF-I and
IGF-II increase substantially during regeneration after
sciatic nerve transection (Hansson, H.A., et al., 1986,
Acta Physiol. Scand., 126:609-614). They have been shown
to promote the survival of cultured sensory and
sympathetic neurons (Ishii, D.N., et al., 1987, In:
Insulin, IGFs and Their Receptors in the Central Nervous
System, eds., Raizada, M.K., et al., Plenum Press, NY,
pp. 315-348) and, in the case of IGF-I, to promote the
survival of cortical neurons (Aizenman, Y., et al., 1987,
Brain Res., 406:32-42). Finally, studies both in-vitro
and in-vivo have demonstrated that IGF-I and IGF-II
promote motor neuron survival and neurite outgrowth
(Caroni, P., et al., 1990, J. Cell Biol., 110:1307-1317).WO-A-90148338 relates to a method of enhancing survival of neuronal
cells in a mammals, said cells being at risk of dying because of aging
or various degenerative diseases. This method comprises the administration
of IGF-1 to said mammal, but it is limited to nervous tissues of the
central nervous system. US-A-5068224 discloses the use of IGF-1 for
improving the regeneration of transected peripheral nerves, but does
not disclose or suggest the use of this compound for reducing peripheral neuropathy. Peripheral neuropathy generally refers to a
disorder that affects the peripheral nerves, most often
manifested as one or a combination of motor, sensory,
sensorimotor, or autonomic neural dysfunction. The wide
variety of morphologies exhibited by peripheral
neuropathies can each be uniquely attributed to an
equally wide variety of causes. For instance, peripheral
neuropathies can be genetically acquired, can result from 
a systemic disease, or can be induced by a toxic agent.
Some toxic agents that cause neurotoxicities are
therapeutic drugs, antineoplastic agents, contaminants in
foods or medicinals, and environmental and industrial
pollutants.In particular, chemotherapeutic agents known to
cause sensory and/or motor neuropathies include
vincristine, an antineoplastic drug used to treat

<CLAIMS>
Use of insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-I) or
insulin-like growth factor-III (IGF-III) for the

manufacture of a medicament for reducing a
peripheral neuropathy that is not caused by an abnormal

insulin level in a mammal.
The use of claim 1, wherein the medicament is adapted
to be administered intravenously or subcutaneously.
The use of claim 1 or claim 2, wherein the neuropathy
is associated with a systemic disease, or is post-polio

syndrome, hereditary neuropathy or Charcot-Marie-Tooth
Disease, or is caused by a toxic agent, such as a

chemotherapeutic agent, alcohol, a metal, an industrial
toxin, a drug, a vitamin, a contaminant of a food, or a

contaminant of a medicinal.
The use of claim 3, wherein the neuropathy is
associated with a chemotherapeutic agent selected from

vincristine, cisplatin, taxol, or dideoxyinosine.
The use of any preceding claim, wherein a
chemotherapeutic agent is used simultaneously in a combined

preparation.
The use of claim 5, wherein the IGF-I or IGF-III, and
the chemotherapeutic agent, are in a ratio of between 1:400

and 75:1 w/w.
The use of claim 6, wherein the chemotherapeutic agent
is vincristine.
The use of claim 7, wherein the ratio is between 1:40
and 8:1 w/w.
The use of any preceding claim, wherein the insulin-like
growth factor is IGF-I.
