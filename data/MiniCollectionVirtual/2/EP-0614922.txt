<ABSTRACT>
A process for the preparation of an aqueous polymer dispersion having a solids concentration of 50% by volume or more, in which free-radical-polymerisable monomers, other than vinyl halides and vinylidene halides, are subjected to free-radical aqueous emulsion polymerisation by the feed method with addition of an aqueous polymer starting dispersion whose dispersed starting polymer particles have a certain minimum diameter.

<CLAIMS>
A process for preparing a final polymer
dispersion having a solids volume concentration of at

least 50% by volume by polymerizing at least one free-radically
polymerizable monomer other than a vinyl or

vinylidene halide with the addition of at least one
aqueous starting polymer dispersion I in a

polymerization vessel by the method of free radical
aqueous emulsion polymerization in the presence of

dispersants and free radical polymerization initiators,
wherein


a) the mass of starting polymer I present in the at
least one added aqueous starting polymer dispersion

I is, relative to the total mass, comprising the
mass of the at least one free-radically

polymerizable monomer and the mass of starting
polymer I added in the form of the aqueous starting

polymer dispersion I, from 0.1 to 10%,
b) the starting polymer I is present in the at least
one aqueous starting dispersion I in the form of

dispersed starting polymer particles of whose total
mass at least 99.6% by weight have a non-zero

particle diameter of ≥ 90 nm to ≤ 500 nm,
c) the total amount of the at least one aqueous starting
polymer dispersion I to be added is introduced

into the polymerization vessel as initial charge
prior to the start of free radical aqueous emulsion

polymerization, 
d) in a first polymerization stage, in the presence of
the initial charge of aqueous starting polymer

dispersion I, initially an aliquot of from 25 to
500% by weight of the total mass of the at least

one monomer to be free-radically polymerized, based
on the mass of the initial charge of starting

polymer I, is polymerized in a conventional manner
to a conversion of at least 80 mol%, based on this

aliquot,
e) following the first polymerization stage the
polymerization of the remainder of the at least one

monomer to be free-radically polymerized is
effected by the feed stream addition method with

the proviso that from the start of the feed stream
addition method the addition of the at least one

free-radically polymerizable monomer to the
polymerization vessel is effected in such a way

that at any time of the addition the polymerization
conversion of the total monomers already added

previously to the polymerization vessel is at least
80 mol%, and
f) the amount of dispersant present in the polymerization
vessel is at any time from the start of the

free radical aqueous emulsion polymerization from
0.5 to 5% by weight, based on the sum of the masses

already introduced into the polymerization vessel
of starting polymer I and of monomers to be polymerized.
