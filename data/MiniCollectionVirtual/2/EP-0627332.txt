<ABSTRACT>
A tread for motor-vehicle tyres has a raised pattern formed of a 
plurality of shaped blocks (7) distributed according to circumferential 

rows (3, 4, 5, 6) disposed parallelly in side by side relation. 
The number of the shaped blocks (7) arranged in each row gradually 

increases on passing from the equatorial plane (X-X) to the side edges 
(1a) of the tread (1). Thus a gradual increase in the longitudinal 

stiffness of the shaped blocks (7) is achieved on passing from the 
side edges (1a) of the tread (1) to the equatorial plane (X-X), which 

brings about a reduction in the mobility of said blocks on the 
imprinting area and a greater quietness of the tyre in use.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a tyre for motor-vehicle
wheels provided with a tread producing a low
rolling noise, according to the preamble of the claim 1.
Such a tyre is known from US-A-4 299 264.It is known that tyres for road motor-vehicles have a
plurality of longitudinal grooves and transverse cuts on
the tread, which define a plurality of shaped blocks thereon,
said blocks being distributed according to a specific
pattern suitably studied.Within said pattern the longitudinal grooves by
effect of which the shaped blocks are distributed in several
side by side rows, give the tyre the desired features
of directional control stability and roadholding in relation
to the drift thrusts directed parallelly of the wheel axis.
The transverse cuts, in turn, give the tyre the desired
tractive features, that is the capability of efficiently transmitting
the tangential thrusts parallel to the running
direction during the speeding up and slowing down
steps of the vehicle. In principle, the tractive power of
the tyre tends to become greater as the number of the
transverse cuts arranged in the tread increases and the
orientation of the cuts themselves approaches the perpendicular
to the running direction.In addition, the longitudinal grooves and transverse
cuts cooperate in performing an efficient draining action
of the water from the imprinting area of the tyre during
the running on a wet road-bed.The presence of the transverse cuts and longitudinal
grooves however causes the well known effect of
noise produced by the tyre rolling. In greater detail, one
of the main causes of the rolling noise has been found
in the continuous succession of impacts of the shaped
block corners on the road-bed.Another contributory cause in generating noise is
given by rubbings that the shaped blocks undergo in
contact with the road-bed when they enter and leave the
imprinting area. These rubbings are essentially due to
the deformations necessarily undergone by the tread, in
that its outer surface which in a free state has a convex
conformation with a double bending, as known, inevitably
becomes flat against the road-bed.The dynamic actions causing the deformation of the
tread between the entry and exit regions to and from the
imprinting area also give rise to a cyclic volumetric variation
of the grooves and cuts defined between the
shaped blocks, which brings about a cyclic compressive
and decompressive action on the air contained in the
grooves and cuts. These phenomena of air compression
and decompression help in causing the
