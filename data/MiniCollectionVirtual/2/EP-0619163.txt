<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a process for manufacturing cutting tools, for example milling cutters, drills, etc., which are provided with cutting tips and cutting edges of polycrystalline diamond, carbide, ceramic or the like. The known manufacturing processes are complicated and expensive. The aim of the invention is to specify a process by means of which the cutting tips can be accurately positioned on the basic body of the tool without special manipulation and which guarantees that all cutting tips of a tool are brazed to the tool body under the same manufacturing conditions and thus with the same strength. This object is achieved in that the individual cutting tips are fixed in their position on the tool body by electric spot welding, then the brazing filler metal required for the brazing is applied to each cutting tip, and after that the tool body and the fixed cutting tips are brazed to one another at a temperature between 720@ and 850@C and a pressure between 10

<CLAIMS>
Method for manufacturing cutting tools such as milling 
tools, drills, etc., which are provided with tips, whereof the 

cutting edges consist of a coating with polycrystalline diamond, 
hard metal, ceramic material or a similar cutting material and 

which after their positioning on the tool body, are connected to 

the latter by soldering, characterized in that the individual 
tips are fixed in position by electrical spot welding on the tool 

body, then the solder necessary for the soldering is applied to 
each tip, whereupon the tool body with the fixed tips are 

soldered together in a vacuum at a temperature of between 720° 
and 850°C and a pressure of between 10⁻⁴ to 10⁻⁶ mbars and that the 

tool is then cooled slowly. 
Method according to Claim 1, characterized in that before 
the fixing of the tips by electrical spot welding, the tool body 

is provided with a reaction layer, for example of nickel. 
Method according to Claim 1 or 2, characterized in that the 
solder is applied in spots in the form of solder paste. 
Method according to one of Claims 1 to 3, characterized in 
that the cooling phase is undertaken in a controlled manner in 

a vacuum furnace. 
Method according to one of Claims 1 to 4, characterized in 
that by controlling the cooling phase, the strength of the basic 

member is influenced in a specific manner. 
Method according to one of Claims 1 to 5, characterized in 
that the tool body with the seating surfaces for the tips is 

produced by material deformation, for example by forging, 
pressing, injection moulding or the like. 
Method according to one of Claims 1 to 6, characterized in 
that several tool bodies with the fixed tips are possibly heated  

 
to the same temperature using protective gas simultaneously in 

vacuum soldering furnaces and are kept at this temperature. 
Cutting tool produced according to the method in accordance 
with one of Claims 1 to 7, which is provided with tips, whereof 

the cutting edges consist of a coating with polycrystalline 
diamond, hard metal, ceramic material or a similar cutting 

material, and which after their positioning on the tool body are 
connected thereto by soldering, characterized in that the 

individual tips are fixed in their position on the tool body by 
electrical spot welding and are provided with solder applied 

after fixing, and that the tips are rhomboid-shaped or 
trapezoidal and the seating surface on the tool body is adapted 

to this shape. 
Cutting tool according to Claim 8, characterized in that the 
inclined sides (4, 4') of the rhomboid extend at an angle of 

approximately 20° to 30°, preferably 25°, and that these inclined 
sides form the abutment and soldering surface of the tip on the 

tool body (1). 
Cutting tool according to one of Claims 8 or 9, 
characterized in that the bottom surface (5) of the rhomboid-shaped 

tip (2) forms the seating surface in the tool body.
