<ABSTRACT>
A device for removing material from the surface of potatoes (5) has a feeding station (1) in which the potatoes (5) are placed in receptacles (6) on a conveyor belt (7) which transports the potatoes (5) in steps to a first cutting station (2), where the potatoes (5) are cut on opposite sides. The potatoes (5) are then clamped on these sides by a clamping device (11), by means of which the potatoes (5) are moved onwards to a second cutting station (4) and simultaneously rotated. In the second cutting station (4), the material is removed from the surface of the potatoes (5) between the clamped sides, finally giving them a barrel-like appearance.
