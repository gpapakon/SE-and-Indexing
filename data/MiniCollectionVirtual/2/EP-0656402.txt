 or by copolymerisation of the same monomer with a monomer which can be copolymerised with the first monomer.   For the definition of the radicals and symbols A, B, L, Q, R1-R18, X, Y, Z, m, n, p and q, reference is made to Claim 1. These pigment compositions display an outstanding rheological behaviour, while the colorations obtained with them are of surprisingly high gloss.
