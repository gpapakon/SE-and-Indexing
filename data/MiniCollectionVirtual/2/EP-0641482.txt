<ABSTRACT>
It is the aim of the invention to produce an arrangement for easy ignition voltage generation ensuring great reliability. The pulse generator (22) is fitted with two ignition coils (2a, 2b) and a permanently-magnetised rotor (4). The rotor spindle (12) is coupled to the spring-loaded drive (5), which also actuates the switch contact (8), by a converter (7). A pair of thyristors (10, 11) connected in anti-parallel is connected in parallel to the switching contact (8). When the spring-loaded drive (5) is tensioned for opening the switching contact (8), the converter (7) is also actuated which causes the rotor (4) of the pulse generator (22) to effect a rotation. The rotor (4) moving in the air gap (13) causes a change in inductance and the production of a voltage pulse in the ignition coils (2a, 2b). These pulses are fed to the thyristors (10, 11) to ignite them, resulting in the switching of the load current from contact (8) to the thyristors (10, 11). This arrangement makes it possible to generate an ignition voltage with a precisely defined crossover independently of an outside current source.

Device of generation of the triggering voltage for 
thyristors, preferably for an load switch equipped with 

thyristors (10, 11), the thyristors (10, 11) being connected 
according to a anti-parallel and parallel wiring with regard 

to the switching contacts or the permanent contacts of the 
load switch. a triggering rotor (4) realized in the form of a 

magnet, rotating in the air gap (13) of a impulse generator 
(22), on an axis perpendicular to the direction of the flow 

of the magnetic field, the coils of the impulse generator 
being realized in the form of triggering coils (2a, 2b), and 

before each displacement of opening of the switching contacts 
or permanent contacts (8), a rotation of the triggering rotor 

(4) being begun, preferably in the direction of the position 
of the maximal magnetization, and continued in almost the 

same angle by passing by the maximal magnetization position, 
without interruption, characterized in that the impulse 

generator is mounted in a vat, in that a resilient detent 
drive (5), moving the switching contact or the permanent 

contact (8), is connected to the triggering rotor (4) through 
a conversion device (7), the conversion device (7) beeing 

realized in the form of a cam disk (57), the shaft (87) of 
the resilient detent drive (5) being connected rigidly axialy 

to the axis of the cam disk centrally mounted, in that the 
rotation of the cam disk can to be transmitted, by means a 

crank, to an auxiliary shaft (44), the crank (101) of a crank 
arm (35) sliding in a groove (39) of the cam disk (57), and 

in that a large size spur pinion (43), rigidly fixed on the 
auxiliary shaft (44), is engaged with a spur pinion (42) of 

smaller size, the small spur pinion (42) being mounted 
rigidly on the axis (12) of the triggering rotor of the 

impulse generator (22) and the rotation of the triggering 
rotor (4) on the position of the maximal magnetization being, 

preferably, of 90 or 180Â°.
