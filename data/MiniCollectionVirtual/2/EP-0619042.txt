<ABSTRACT>
A disk recording system for disks such as videodisks or compact disks has a turntable (2) on which the disk (1) is supported adjacent a recording head (10). A shaft (3) defining the axis of rotation of the turntable rotates in a bearing (4) and that bearing (4) is itself movable about an axis defined by another shaft (8). The bearing (9) of the shaft (8) is an air bearing and there is a damper unit (18) for damping that movement. There may be a sensor (14) for detecting the rate of rotation of the shaft (3) defining the axis of rotation of the turntable (2). The radial displacement of the head (10) relative to the axis of the turntable (2) may be determined on the basis of rotation of the other shaft (8), and the rotation of the turntable controlled on the basis of the product of signals representing the radial displacement and the rate of rotation of the shaft (3) respectively.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a disk recording
system, for recording a disk such as a compact disk.
The present invention also relates to a method of
controlling the rotation of a turntable relative to a
recording head in a disk recording system.Many systems are known in which information is
recorded on a disk-shaped medium and may subsequently
be played back. Generally the information is arranged
either in substantially circular rings or in a
continuous spiral track on the disk. An example of
the former arrangement is the magnetic floppy disk or
hard disk, where the information is divided into
sectors lying in concentric tracks. Examples of the
latter arrangement include the conventional gramophone
record carrying sound information in analog form in
the spiral groove in its surface, the optically read
videodisk carrying video information in analog form in
a series of pits arranged spirally on the surface (or
on an interfacial boundary) of the disk, and the
compact optical disk carrying audio or other
information in digital form in a series of spirally-arranged 
pits. The gramophone record, the videodisk
and the compact disk are all examples of media
available to the consumer which cannot normally be
recorded on by the consumer; recording takes place on
a master disk which is subsequently replicated by
various processes such that the disks bought by the
consumer are close copies of the geometry and the
information content of the master disk.The process of recording information on any of
these media usually shares in common the fact that the
disk or master disk is rotated at a speed typically
anywhere between 162/3 r.p.m. (for some gramophone
records) and 1,800 r.p.m. (or even higher for some
videodisks) while the point of recording (which may be
a magnetic head, a mechanical stylus, or a focused
light beam) is traversed between the inside and outer
edge of the disk at a slower rate. Normally it is a
requirement of the recording system that the
rotational motion of the disk may vary only slowly, if
at all; generally this is easily ensured by the
inertia of the disk itself, together with that of the
mechanism which rotates it. The radial motion of the
point of recording on the disk is, however, not so
easily controlled. In the case of magnetic disk
recording, it is usual that the recording head must
move in discrete steps between the separate concentric
tracks; by contrast, in the cases of gramophone
records, videodisks, or compact disks, the recording 
head must move continuously relative to the disk
