<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to an apparatus for handling and 
storing a bendable elongate body in extended horizontal 
position, preferably a length of flexible pipeline intended 
for fluid conduction. The invention was developed primarily in connection with the 
need for a fluid transfer system between a maritime floating 
oil storage facility, for example a large-size barge with 
oil storing capacity, and a so-called shuttle tanker. The 
oil tank barge is anchored or dynamically positioned on the 
oil production field and serves as an intermediate storage 
means for the oil produced. From this barge the oil is 
loaded over into tankers, which on arrival at the field are 
connected to the barge by suitable mooring means, whereafter 
a fluid conducting pipe connection is established between the 
barge and tanker. The fluid conducting pipe connection is 
formed by a length of fluid conducting pipeline which, when 
not in use, is stored on the barge. During fluid transfer, 
the flexible pipeline hangs suspended between the barge and 
tanker, more or less submerged in the water, or if desired is 
freely suspended above the water surface. The length of flexible pipeline is advantageously stored in 
extended horizontal position on the deck of the barge. When 
the flexible pipeline is to be utilized for fluid transfer 
between the barge and tanker, the flexible pipe is fed down 
into the water from its horizontal storage position on board 
the barge via a ramp curved downward in the vertical plane. 
Conversely, after completion of the fluid transfer, the 
pipeline is uncoupled and drawn on board the barge again. 
The handling of the flexible length of pipeline during the 
transition between its storage and usage states can lead to 
difficulties due to the fact that it involves a flexible  
 
pipeline which must be handled in a relatively gentle manner 
and which, in both handling and storage, requires an evenly 
distributed support means along the length of the pipeline, 
spaced at moderate intervals. A continuous support, such as 
would be provided, for example, if the pipeline were to be 
laid directly on the barge deck, is undesirable because the 
feeding out/hauling in of the pipeline would generate too 
much friction between the pipeline and the supporting deck 
surface. Lifting of the pipeline and its manipulation in the 
longitudinal direction with the aid of crane equipment is 
highly undesirable as well as impossible to implement in 
practice. Here one must bear in mind that we are dealing 
with a flexible

<CLAIMS>
An apparatus for feeding and storing a bendable, elongate 
body in extended, horizontal position, preferably a length 

of flexible pipeline (3) intended for fluid conduction, 
comprising a guide track having support means for the 

bendable elongate body, 
characterized in
 
that the support means are constructed as carriers (10) in 

the guide tracks (8), slidable in the longitudinal direction 
thereof, for bearing the bendable elongate body (3) without 

substantial mutual movement between carriers and said 
elongated body. 
An apparatus according to claim l, 
characterized 
in
 that the guide track includes a storage section (9), 
where the carriers (10) are stored when not in use, and a 

bearing section (8), where the carriers (10) are situated 
when in use and bearing said body (3). 
An apparatus according to claim 2, 
characterized 
in
 that the storage section (9) is in the form of a 
diagonal section of track line extending downward from one 

end of the horizontal bearing section (8). 
An apparatus according to claim 3, 
characterized 
in
 that the guide track is arranged with its horizontal 
bearing section (8) on level with a support path (4) for the 

body (3), with the sloping storage section (9) extending down 
under the support path (4). 
An apparatus according to one of the preceding claims,  
 


characterized in
 that the carriers (10) are 
coupled together with a flexible, elongated drive member 

(11), for example a chain, running in the longitudinal 
direction of the body (3). 
An apparatus according to one of the preceding claims, 

characterized in
 that each carrier (10) is 
formed as a cradle adapted to the circumferential shape of 

the elongate body (3), having running wheels (17,18) at each 
end of the cradle for movement on/in the guide track (8,9,13, 

14). 
An apparatus according to one of the preceding claims, 

characterized by
 a winch (7) for hauling 
in/feeding out the body (3), and an auxiliary winch (12) for 

initiating the discharge of the body.
