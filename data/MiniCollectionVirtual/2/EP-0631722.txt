<ABSTRACT>
Disclosed is a method for exterminating microbes 
for disinfection and deodorization by the use of a 

microbicidal composition containing, as the active 
ingredient, at least one nitrogen-containing nonionic 

surfactant preferably selected from polyoxyethylene fatty 
acid amides and polyoxyethylene alkylamines. Preferably 

used are polyoxyethylene fatty acid amides where the fatty 
acid amide moiety has from 12 to 24 carbon atoms and the 

number of mols of ethylene oxide added to the moiety is 20 
or less, and polyoxyethylene alkylamines where the higher 

alkylamine moiety has from 12 to 24 carbon atoms and the 
number of mols of ethylene oxide added to the moiety is 20 

or less. The microbicidal composition is highly effective 
against both gram-negative microbes and gram-positive 

microbes including MRSA, while having an excellent 
disinfecting and deodorizing activity.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method for 
exterminating microbes for disinfection and deodorization 
applicable to various fields of food-related environments 
such as dining halls, kitchens, etc., kitchen utensils, 
food-wrapping materials such as food containers, food 
wrapping films, etc., medical service-related environments 
such as passageways in hospitals, floors, walls and 
curtains in sickrooms, etc., gloves and gowns for doctors 
and nurses, medical appliances, medical supplies, etc. As means for exterminating microbes for 
disinfection and deodorization in food-related fields, for 
example, there have heretofore been known various 
microbicide-containing plastic products, such as food 
containers, food-wrapping films, films for maintaining the 
freshness of vegetables and fruits, chopping boards, etc. 
These are to prevent the growth of bacteria that cause 
sitotoxism, such as Escherichiacoli, Staphylococcusaureus, Streptococcuspyogenes, Pseudomonasaeruginosa,  
 
etc., and also to exterminate putrefying bacteria that 
cause offensive odors. The requirements for microbicides 
to be used as additives to the above-mentioned food-wrapping 
plastics are such that (1) they have low 
toxicity, (2) their microbicidal activity lasts for a long 
period of time to several years and, additionally in 
Japan, (3) they pass the Food Sanitation Standard of 
Notification No. 370 of the Welfare Ministry of Japan, (4) 
they are approved by the Polyolefin Sanitation Conference, 
etc. Up to this time, however, there are known no organic 
compounds that meet the above-mentioned requirements and 
have been approved usable as additives to food-wrapping 
plastics. On the other hand, as inorganic compounds, 
silver ion compounds such as typically silver nitrate have 
low toxicity and therefore have been partly used as 
additives to plastics. However, even though they have low 
toxicity, silver itself is a toxic substance. In 
addition, regarding their microbicidal activity, they are 
effective against gram-negative microbes such as 
Escherichiacoli, etc. but are poorly effective or are 
rather quite ineffective against gram-positive microbes 
such as methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus 
(MRSA), etc. Moreover, since silver compounds are 
inorganic compounds, they are unevenly localized only in 
the inside of shaped plastics, if added thereto, so that  
 
they cannot be exposed out on the surfaces of shaped 
products and therefore their microbicidal activity is 
difficult to effectively display.
