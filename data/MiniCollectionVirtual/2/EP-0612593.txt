<ABSTRACT>
A powered bread slicer capable of slicing 
successive loaves of bread to selected different slice 

thicknesses comprises a rotating circular bread slicing 
knife (24) which is mounted on a pivotal, reciprocal 

arm (28) for shifting the knife from a retracted 
position through slicing positions between and 

transverse to an infeed table (16) and an outfeed table 

(18), and return to the retracted position. The slice 
thickness is selected by control of a variable stepper 

motor (104) which incrementally advances a loaf pusher 
(60) one step at a time, the dimension of the step 

being of the selected slice thickness dimension. The 
distance by the travelled loaf pusher to reach the end 

of its travel is monitored to determine whether the 
bread heel is thick enough to slice once more. This 

decision is a function of the selected slice thickness 
dimension. A detector (19) sensing the leading end of 

the loaf initially activates the slicer knife drive and 
the support arm drive. A pusher detector (112a) 

adjacent the knife prevents knife advancement with 
presence of the pusher adjacent the knife, but then 

allowing the pusher to move past the knife to push the 
fully sliced loaf completely onto the discharge table 

(18), and then return to the infeed table.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to
a variable thickness bread
slicer as for delicatessens, bakery stores, restaurants
and the like, where it is desirable to be able to slice
bread in varying thicknesses.Conventional bread slicers are typically set up to
slice loaves of bread to a specific thickness. For
example, a rectangular-shaped loaf may be sliced to a
thickness of 12.5 mm, 9.5 or 6.25 mm (1/2, 3/8 or 1/4
inch) and garlic bread or French bread perhaps 25 mm
(one inch) in thickness. In small bakeries where the
bread is sold to customers directly, or other similar
situations, it would be desirable to be able to adjust
the slicer from one thickness to another quickly, even
for successive loaves of bread for successive
customers. However, known slicers require substantial
disassembly and reassembly by a knowledgeable person
over a period of 15 to 30 minutes, to change the
slicing thickness. Indeed, some slicers are not
subject to any variation at all.There is a need in the market for a powered bread
slicer which can slice one loaf to a particular slice
thickness, e.g., 12.5 mm, readily slice the next loaf
to another thickness, e.g., 9.5 mm, slice the third
loaf to a third thickness, e.g., 25 mm or so, and so
forth, without significant time delay or complexity.DE 3232045 relates to a bread slicer including a
feed element for feeding bread to a knife blade, the
knife blade comprising a sickle blade mounted at one end
on a rotatable shaft. The invention is set out in claim 1 appended hereto.
Preferred features are set out in the dependent claims.This invention thus provides a bread slicer
capable of slicing successive loaves of bread to
varying selected slice thicknesses, even by persons
untrained in mechanical apparatus. The operator simply
selects any of a multitude of potential thicknesses and
activates the slicer. The bread loaf is advanced by a
pusher, step-by-step, to be fed to a rotating or
pivotally reciprocating cutting knife. Each step is of
selected thickness.
The slicer may
be constructed to work effectively on crusty breads
such as garlic breads and French breads, as well as on
soft, somewhat wet breads, such as conventional
American bread.The invention my be carried into practice in 
various ways but one bread slicer constructed in
accordance with the invention will now be described by
way of example with reference to the accompanying
drawings, in which:
Fig. 1 is a perspective, front view of the bread
slicer;Fig. 2 is a perspective view comparable to Fig. 1,
but with the protective covers raised;Fig.

<CLAIMS>
A bread slicing machine comprising: a slide platform
(14) to support a loaf of bread, including an infeed

table (16) and an outfeed table (18); a rotational bread
slicing knife (24); a step-by-step bread pusher (60)

shiftable along said infeed table in intermittent
increments toward said slicing knife, to advance the

bread in intermittent incremental steps of preselected
dimension; and means (114) to vary the dimension of said

increments; characterised by a support arm (28)
rotationally supporting said slicing knife and shiftable

to advance said knife through slicing positions between,
and transverse to, said infeed and outfeed tables, and to

return said knife to a retracted position away from said
tables and any bread thereon; and arm shifting motor

means (70) operably connected to said support arm for
shifting said support arm and thereby said knife between

said slicing positions and said retracted position, said
arm shifting motor means (70) and step-by-step bread

pusher (60) having control means for selectively shifting
said support arm to said slicing position in response to

said bread pusher

a particular distance from
a prior increment to a predetermined end of travel position.

travels momentarily past said knife to said outfeed table
to push the fully sliced bread loaf completely onto said

outfeed table, and subsequently return to said infeed
table.
