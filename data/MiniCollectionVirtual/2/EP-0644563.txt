<ABSTRACT>
A capacitor for the magnetron of a microwave oven is 
disclosed, in which the structure is relatively simple, so 

that the material cost would be saved, and that the 
productivity would be improved. An elliptic opening (111) 

is formed on a side wall of a shielding case (100) for 
installing a capacitor. The circumference of the opening 

(111) is bent to form a projected portion (110) for 
attaching a capacitor, and a recess (113) is formed on the 

reverse side of the projected portion (110). An insulation 
resin case (120a, 220) is formed on the projected portion 

so as to surround the capacitor by a molding process using 
an epoxy resin. An insulation cylinder (120b) with an 

upper portion inserted in the recess also can be molded 
simultaneously with the insulation resin case (120a). 

Since in replacement of an insulating case and/or 
insulating cylinder of a conventional capacitor, an 

insulation resin structure (120) is formed by a molding 
process, the number of elements is reduced and the 

assembling process for attaching these elements is 
eliminated to thereby improve the productivity. Further, 

since the holes for fastening a ground fitment are not 
required, the noise can be effectively shielded.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a capacitor for 
effectively shielding a noise generated in a magnetron of 
a microwave oven. More particularly, the present invention 
relates to a capacitor for shielding a noise in a 
magnetron having a simple structure but a high performance 
to improve the productivity and to save the overall 
manufacturing cost. Generally, various apparatuses such as home microwave 
ovens, commercial thawing apparatuses, industrial driers 
and the like using microwaves are provided with a 
magnetron for generating microwaves, and a capacitor for 
shielding noises. In an electric field room of a microwave oven, there 
is provided with a magnetron for generating microwaves. 
Such microwaves are generated when a high voltage produced 
by primary and secondary induction coils of a high voltage 
transformer which is attached on a base plate of the 
electric field room, is stably supplied to the magnetron, 
the high voltages being generated through the inductive 
interaction between the induction coils. Such microwaves 
are irradiated into a cooking chamber through an 
irradiating tube. When the microwaves are irradiated into the cooking  
 
chamber after passing through the irradiating tube, the 
food placed within the cooking chamber is heated so as to 
be cooked. The power supply line of the magnetron is mainly 
consisted of a filament, a cathode and an anode. When the 
high voltage is supplied to the magnetron to generate 
microwaves, unnecessarily radiated microwaves, i.e., 
noises are generated, besides microwaves having basic 
frequencies which are suitable for heating the food. Then, 
the noises flow back through the filament and the cathode 
so as to cause wave obstructions in the nearby 
apparatuses. Particularly, coming recently, television broadcasts 
resorting to satellites are widely utilized. The 
unnecessary microwaves of the magnetron interact with the 
broadcasting frequencies and therefore there is a 
possibility that receiving disorders may occur on a 
television receiver. In order to reduce such adverse influences given due 
to the magnetron noise to the nearby apparatuses, a choke 
coil and a capacitor connected thereto are provided on the 
cathode which supplies power to the filament. The choke 
coil which has a reactance, and the capacitor which is 
connected to the choke coil absorb the unnecessary 
microwaves, thereby blocking the leakage of the 
unnecessary microwaves. The choke coil is sealed within a shielding case 
which is provided under the magnetron,
