<ABSTRACT>
In a color filter substrate including a black 
matrix (2) and RGB patterns (3), each of the RGB patterns (3) 

provided on the black matrix (2) is disposed along a 
direction oblique to a reference direction of the black 

matrix which is defined by sides of apertures (4) formed in 
the black matrix.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a color filter
substrate used for a liquid crystal display device etc.
and its making method.A color filter substrate for display devices
etc. consists of RGB materials and a black matrix. In the
conventional art for making the color filter substrate,
the black matrix is formed by a photolithograph method
using a metal thin film such as chrome, a photolithograph
method using a black pigment resist or a printing method
using an original plate of the screen printing, intaglio
printing, relief printing or planography. Also, the RGB
materials are formed by the photolithograph method using
the pigment resist, the printing method or an
electrodeposition method etc.One or more methods of the above-mentioned
plural methods have been selected or combined with each
other to satisfy the necessity of size, configuration,
preciseness of position, cost and working efficiency.FIG.11 is a plan view showing the conventional
color filter which has been used for a long while. This 
color filter is formed by the combination of a black
matrix 7 of metal thin film and RGB dot patterns 8. The
matrix film 7 is made by the photolithograph method using
a chrome thin film. The RGB dot patterns 8 are made by
the photolithograph method using a pigment resist.
However, due to its high making costs, another making
method was expected to reduce costs.In response to the above-mentioned needs, such a
method is employed that the black matrix is made by a
photolithograph method using a black pigment resist. This
method was expected to reduce costs by a combination with
the printing method and the electrodeposit method which
had a high productivity as a method for forming RGB
materials.FIGs.8-10 are illustrations showing disposition
of the RGB materials having the form of stripe, delta
(triangle) and diagonal mosaic, respectively. Since the
display device for office automation equipments such as a
personal computer mainly necessitates to display
characters only, the stripe type disposition having the
linearly-disposed RGB materials is usable. However, the
display device for the audio-visual equipments such as a
TV set necessitates to obtain a soft and fine picture for
displaying moving portrait etc. Therefore, both the delta
disposition (FIG.9) having a triangle disposition of the
RGB materials in every block and the mosaic disposition 
(FIG.10) are considered suitable to such requirement of
the soft and fine picture.When the printing method or the
electrodeposition method is used for a screen of
