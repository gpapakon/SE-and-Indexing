<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a polyolefin composition, and 
more specifically to a polyolefin composition comprising (A) 
a propylene polymer material and (B) an olefin polymer 
material, and most specifically to a polyolefin composition 
comprising (A) a propylene polymer material and an olefin 
polymer material of a partially crosslinked thermoplastic 
elastomer composition, an ethylene-propylene-conjugated diene 
terpolymer rubber or a mixture thereof. Olefin polymer materials, in particular propylene polymer 
materials, have been widely used in various applications, such 
as fibers, films, sheets and other shaped articles, because of 
their excellent physical and mechanical properties. However, 
some of the olefin polymer materials have been found 
undesirable for applications requiring low gloss, such as 
thermoforming, extrusion coating, blow molding, injection 
molding and sheet or film extrusion, because of their high 
gloss after processing. Thus, there is a need in the industry for olefin polymer 
materials having low gloss after processing, and which 
substantially retain their physical and mechanical properties. It has been found that by blending a olefin polymer 
material with a partially crosslinked thermoplastic elastomer 
composition, an ethylene-propylene-conjugated diene terpolymer 
rubber or a mixture thereof, a composition is obtained having 
reduced gloss. Accordingly, there is provided a polyolefin composition 
consisting essentially of (A) from 70 to 90% by weight of a 
propylene polymer material and (B) from 30 to 10% by weight of 
an olefin polymer material selected from the group consisting 
of a partially crosslinked thermoplastic elastomer  
 
composition, an ethylene-propylene-conjugated diene terpolymer 
rubber and a mixture thereof. All parts and percentages used in this application are by 
weight unless otherwise specified. Ambient or room 
temperature is approximately 25°C. Component (A) used in the composition of the present 
invention is a a propylene polymer material consisting 
essentially of: 
(1) from 10 to 50% of a propylene homopolymer, 
preferably from 10 to 40%, and most preferably from 20 to 
35%, having an isotactic index of from 80 to greater than 
99%, and preferably from 85 to 99%, or a copolymer 
selected from the group consisting of (a) propylene and 
ethylene, (b) propylene, ethylene and a CH2=CHR alpha-olefin, 
where R is a C2-8 straight or branched alkyl, and 
(c) propylene and an alpha-olefin, as defined above in 
(1)(b), wherein said copolymer contains
