<ABSTRACT>
A direction adjustment indicator (17) for a satellite radio 
wave receiving antenna comprises a demodulating circuit (20) to 

demodulate a satellite radio wave received by the antenna, a 
peak holding circuit (21) always to output a held peak value of 

the demodulated output of the demodulating circuit, a comparator 
circuit (22) and a display element (23). The comparator circuit 

(22) compares the instantaneous value of the demodulated output 
and the held peak value, and outputs a signal when both 

values are equal and another different signal when both 
values are not equal. The display element (23) gives two different 

kinds of display in accordance with the signals. While the 
azimuth angle of the antenna is varied in one direction, a 

peak value of the demodulated output is held and while the 
angle is varied in the opposite direction, the optimum 

azimuth angle is displayed for which the instantaneous value 
of the demodulated output agrees with the held peak value.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to an indicator to teach the
desirable receiving direction of a satellite radio wave
receiving antenna while the direction of the antenna is adjusted.When a satellite radio wave received by an antenna is
demodulated and the demodulated output of the wave exceeds a
predetermined reference level, an indicator lights, and when
the demodulated output does not exceed the level, the indicator
is extinguished. Let it be supposed that this
reference level is set to a value appropriate for an area
where the received level of the satellite radio wave is high,
for example, for Nagoyo (the central area of Japan). When the
antenna is directed in a desirable receiving direction, that
is, in the direction of high received radio wave level, the
indicator lights and it is otherwise extinguished. The antenna
is thus mounted successfully so that it may be directed
in the desirable direction.When the indicator with the same reference level is used
in an area where the received radio wave level is low, for
example, in Okinawa (the south end area of Japan), the 
demodulated output in any receiving direction, however, does
not exceed the reference level and the indicator continues to
be-extinguished. The indicator, therefor, is not helpful for
finding the desirable receiving direction. If the reference
level is lowered and the indicator operates satisfactorily in
the area of low received radio wave level, this indicator, in
turn, continues to light in the area of high received radio
wave level and again is not helpful for finding the desirable
receiving direction.The received level of the satellite radio wave,
moreover, decreases with increasing cloudiness. The reference
level of the indicator is usually set to a value appropriate
for the clear sky in an area. When this indicator is used under
the cloudy sky even in the same area, the indicator does
not light for any receiving direction and may not be helpful
for determining the desirable receiving direction.DE-A 24 31 587 discloses a direction adjustment indicator in accordance with the
preamble of the claim. According to the teaching of DE-A 24 31 587, the receiving antenna
is rotated around its vertical axis, and the detected field strength is monitored throughout a
first rotation of 360Â°. The detected field strength signal is stored in a peak holding circuit
and is compared to the actual signal amplitude. During a second rotational movement of the
antenna, the antenna is automatically brought into that position at which the maximum
receiving signal
