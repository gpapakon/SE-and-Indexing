<ABSTRACT>
The safety closure has a closure cap (12) in whose end wall (14) a weakening groove (22) is arranged so that the end wall can tear open in the case of excess pressure in order to prevent the bottle bursting. The weakening groove (22) is arranged on the inside of the end wall (14). The result of this is that the action of the weakening groove has no effect on the bulging-out of the end wall (14) and that the release pressure can be maintained in a reproducible manner. Furthermore, the outside of the end wall is undamaged so that any printing on the end wall is not destroyed or damaged by the weakening groove.
