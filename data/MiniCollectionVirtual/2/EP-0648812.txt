<ABSTRACT>
The present invention provides a three-component blend of (i) an aromatic 
polyethersulfone, (ii) an aromatic polyimide, and (iii) an alkyl-substituted 

aromatic polyimide, polyamide or polyamide-imide or mixtures thereof. The 
invention also provides for gas separation membranes with superior gas 

transport properties made from two-and-three-component blends of 
polyethersulfone with aromatic polyimides to provide a gas separation 

membrane with superior productivity and good selectivity.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates generally to three-component blends of 
aromatic polyethersulfones, an aromatic polyimide and an alkyl-substituted 
aromatic polyimide, polyamide or polyamide-imide. The invention also relates 
to gas separation membranes cast from a two-component or three-component 
polymer blend of aromatic polyethersulfones with an aromatic polyimide and/or 
an alkyl-substituted aromatic polyimide, polyamide or polyamide-imide. The 
precise gas transport properties of the membrane may be adjusted based on the 
blending of the specific polymer components. It is well known to modify polymer properties through blending to 
obtain inexpensive materials with improved characteristics. Polymer blends are 
broadly classified into homogeneous (miscible) and heterogeneous (immiscible) 
blends. Homogeneous blends are relatively rare; however, a homogeneous 
blend of an aromatic polyethersulfone and an aromatic polyimide has been 
described in the art. In particular, "Thermal and Rheological Properties of 
Miscible Polyethersulfone/Polyimide Blends" by K. Liang, J. Grebowicz, E. 
Valles, F. E. Karasz and W. J. MacKnight, published in the Journal of Polymer 
Science: Part B: Polymer Physics, Vol. 30, pp. 465-476 (1992) describes a 
miscible blend of an aromatic polyethersulfone (commercial name VICTREX®) 
and an aromatic polyimide (commercial name MATRIMID® 5218) over the 
entire blend composition range, particularly blends containing less than 10% of 
the aromatic polyimide. Aromatic polyethersulfones are not, however, miscible with other 
aromatic polyimides, polyamides or polyamide-imides. This immiscibility, 
along with excellent high-temperature properties and high softening 
temperatures, have made blends of aromatic polyethersulfones and aromatic 
polyimides, polyamides or polyamide-imides very difficult to fabricate into 
many products. The fabrication of films, coatings, and other structures from 
blends of aromatic polyethersulfones and aromatic polyimides, polyamides or 
polyamideimides generally requires elaborate processes. Particularly, it is  
 
known that the aromatic polyethersulfone having the following repeating 
formula: 
 
is not miscible with certain alkyl substituted aromatic polyimides, polyamides or 
polyamide-imides. It is also generally known that gas separation membranes may be cast 
from polymers. The separation of gas components by polymer membranes is 
thought to depend on chemical affinities, kinetics and structural characteristics; 
it being known that rubbery
