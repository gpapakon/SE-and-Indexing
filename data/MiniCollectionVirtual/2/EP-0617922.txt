<ABSTRACT>
The invention proposes a Doppler ultrasound probe (1) which can be used directly in conjunction with a hollow needle (5) for puncturing a blood vessel. The hollow needle (5) can be placed after the desired blood vessel has been located by the Doppler ultrasound probe (1). A needle guide (17) leads concentrically through the probe head. The hollow needle (5) is pushed through the needle guide (17). It can thus be placed very accurately. The Doppler ultrasound probe (1) can be opened in wedge-shaped fashion in the region of its probe head (11) and the needle guide (17), so that it can be extended from the sides of the needle that has been placed.

An ultrasonic Doppler probe (1) for locating blood vessels in 
a body and their opening with a hollow needle (5), said ultrasonic 

Doppler probe (1) comprising a probe head (11) located in a support 
(14) and having an ultrasonic transmitter (11') and an ultrasonic 

receiver (11''), a needle guide (17) arranged as a bore in the probe 
head (11) and at least partly surrounded by the ultrasonic transmitter 

(11') and ultrasonic receiver (11''), for introducing and pushing 
through the hollow needle (5), and a replaceable coupling part (41) 

with a filling (43) of a material having approximately the same 
ultrasonic characteristics as the body to be examined, the support 

(14) being a spring clip with two clip halves (14', 14'') joined by 
means of a swivel hinge (15) and with clip cheeks (18, 18') abutting 

on one another and defining a separating plane (16), and in which the 
probe head (11) is so positioned in the clip cheeks (18, 18') that 

the ultrasonic transmitter (11') and the ultrasonic receiver (11'') 
are located in the two clip halves (14', 14''), divided by the 

separating plane (16), characterised in that the probe head (11) is 
constructed cylindrically, that the bore is positioned coaxially to 

the probe head (11), that the ultrasonic transmitter (11') and 
ultrasonic receiver (11'') project in the needle piercing direction 

out of the support (14) and that the coupling part (41) is a 
cylindrical moulding (42), which partly surrounds the probe head 

(11), has a through longitudinal bore (47) for pushing through the 
hollow needle (5) and a separating surface (48) forming an extension 

of the separating plane (16). 
An ultrasonic Doppler probe according to claim 1, characterised 
in that in the case of a spring clip opened by pressure closing the 

clip cheeks (18, 18') are forced apart, so that the probe head (11) 
and needle guide (17) at the separating plane (16) and the coupling 

part (41) at the separating surface (48) are opened in lateral  
 

wedge-like manner so that the ultrasonic Doppler probe (1) with 
coupling part (41) can be extended sideways from the hollow 

needle (5). 
An ultrasonic Doppler probe according to claim 1, characterised 

in that the replaceable coupling part (41) has an inclined contact 
surface (46) for the transmission of sound waves to the body to be 

examined. 
An ultrasonic Doppler probe according to claim 3, characterised 
in that the probe head (11) has a planar contact surface (19) for the 

transmission of sound waves via the coupling part (41) into a body to 
be examined. 
An ultrasonic Doppler probe according to claim 2, characterised 
in that the probe head (11) has a two-stage contact surface (19) for 

transmitting sound waves via the coupling part (41) into a body to 
be examined.
