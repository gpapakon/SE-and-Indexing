<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to the preparation of oximes
from essentially water insoluble carbonyl compounds, i.e.
ketones or aldehydes, and in particular to improved
processes employing a phase transfer catalyst.
Hydroxyoximes prepared by the improved method are useful as
metal extractants.As described in U.S. Patent 4,868,334, oximes are
generally produced by reacting an organic carbonyl compound
such as an aldehyde or ketone with hydroxylamine, usually
generated from a hydroxylamine salt such as
hydroxylammonium sulfate or hydroxylammonium chloride.Current oximation procedures, particularly of long 
alkyl chain ketones, employ standard oximation processes
with an alcohol, such as methanol as a solvent,
hydroxylammonium sulfate and sodium acetate. Since sodium
acetate must be anhydrous and is considerably more
expensive than sodium carbonate, attempts have been made to
employ sodium carbonate in the ketoximation procedure, but
such attempts have not been successful.U.S. Patent 4,133,834 describes the general
preparation of alpha and beta-hydroxyoximes generally
useful as extractants for metals such as copper from
aqueous solutions and discusses, as exemplary processes,
those of U.S. Patents 3,449,066 and 3,592,775 relative to
the preparation of aliphatic, alpha-hydroxyoximes, from the
corresponding acyloins and beta-hydroxyoximes from the
corresponding aromatic phenones. In each of the processes
the reaction is carried out under reflux conditions with an
hydroxylamine salt in an alcohol medium (such as methanol)
in the presence of a weak base, such as sodium acetate.
Such methods typically required long reaction times for
completion, particularly when the oximes included aromatic
groups. The 4,133,834 patent describes a process for
reducing the time of reaction by employing catalytic
amounts of iron, Fe+2 and Fe+3. Nawal K. Mathur and Chander
K. Narang, in "Laboratory Experiments on Phase-Transfer-Catalyzed
Reactions of Neutral Molecules", J. Chem. Ed.,
67, p. 273, March 1990, describe the oximation of
benzophenone by first preparing an aqueous solution of
hydroxylammonium chloride (1 equiv/equiv of ketone) in 
water and neutralizing with sodium hydroxide (1 equiv).
This results in high concentration of free hydroxylamine
being present all at once, which in large scale operations
would present an unsafe condition. To this is added an
equal volume of toluene containing 1 equivalent of
benzophenone and 1 equivalent (stoichiometric amount) of
2-ethylhexanoic acid at 60°C for 1.5 hour. In the reaction
mixture
