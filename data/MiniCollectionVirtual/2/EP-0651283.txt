<ABSTRACT>
A photographic element capable of forming a 
reversal image is disclosed having an emulsion layer 

containing a blend of spectrally sensitized tabular 
iodohalide grains and a second, slower fine grain 

population of a higher overall solubility silver salt 
content for increasing speed and contrast. A second 

dye is adsorbed to the surface of the second grain 
population to provide a further increase in threshold 

speed.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention is directed to an improvement
in reversal photographic elements containing tabular
grain emulsions.Sowinski and Shuman U.S. Patent 4,656,122
discovered quite unexpectedly that the reversal imaging
properties of photographic elements employing a tabular
iodohalide grain emulsion could be improved by blending
with the tabular grains relatively finer and slower
grains of higher overall solubility silver salt
content. Higher speed and contrast were the primary
advantages observed by blending, although higher
maximum density and lower toe region density were also
observed. Not only was the effect surprising, but it
was even more surprising that qualitatively different
effects were observed when the relatively fine grain
emulsion was moved from the emulsion layer to an
adjacent layer or the tabular grain emulsion was
replaced by a nontabular grain emulsion. Further the
advantages were not reproducible when silver iodide
grains were substituted for the relatively fine grains
of higher overall solubility. Sowinski and Shuman
offered no theory to explain the improved results
reported.Despite the combination of advantages
afforded by the teachings of Sowinski and Shuman there
has remained a need for still further increases in
threshold speed that can be realizing while retaining
the remaining advantages taught by Sowinski and Shuman.In one aspect this invention is directed to a
photographic element capable of forming a reversal
image comprised of a support and, coated on the
support, at least one image recording emulsion layer
comprised of a blend of a tabular grain emulsion
containing silver iodohalide tabular grains and a 
spectral sensitizing dye adsorbed to the surface of the
tabular grains and a second emulsion that is when
identically coated, exposed and processed at least 0.3
log E slower in speed than the tabular grain emulsion,
where E is exposure in lux-seconds and speed is measured
at a density representing the mid-point between maximum
and minimum densities, the second emulsion grain
populatin having an average equivalent circular diameter
of less than 0.3 µm, being fomred of one or more silver
halide salts having a higher overall solubility than the
silver iodohalide forming the tabular grains, and being
present in a concentration of at least 0.5 mole percent,
based on the total grains in the blend,
   characterized in that said second emulsion contains
adsorbed to the surface of the second grain population a
second dye exhibiting a peak absorption differing from
that of the spectral
