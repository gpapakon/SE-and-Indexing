<ABSTRACT>
The invention provides an apparatus for compressively molding cushioning 
material using a quadrangular cylindrical molding box (12) having an end side 

closed by a receiver mold (13), whereas the other end of said molding box 
receives supply of dry raw material (M) consisting of fiberized paper or pulp 

by a volume corresponding to several times the actual volume of a molded 
body. A compressive mold (41) inserted from the other end of the molding box 

is shifted to one-end side of the molding box to compress supplied raw 
material (M) between a receiver mold. Simultaneously, a core member (14) is 

retreated to a predetermined position of said one-end side in association 
with the shifting movement of the compressive mold. As a result, the core 

portion having thin thickness and the interior of the core member can 
securely be compressed and molded with even density.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method and an 
apparatus for compressively molding cushioning 
material. More particularly, the invention provides a 
method and an apparatus for molding package 
cushioning material capable of alleviating vibration 
and shock generated on the way of transporting a 
packaged product or load by disposing cushioning 
material every corner of the product by utilizing 
cushioning material made from dried fiberized paper 
or pulp having 20 through 50% by weight of water 
content. Conventionally, majority of cushioning material used 
for packaging products is shared by the one made from 
synthetic resin such as foamed styrol or PVC for 
example. However, majority of used cushioning 
material is abandoned without being collected. After 
being abandoned in reclaimed land, cushioning 
material cannot be decomposed spontaneously. When 
being burnt, cushioning material generates an 
enormous degree of heat to incur damage to combustion 
facilities, thus raising critical problem. DE-C 937 015 discloses a method and an apparatus for 
compressively molding cushioning material. The 
apparatus comprises a perforated receiver mold, which 
is set to a quadrangular cylindrical molding box by  
 
way of closing one-end side. The apparatus further 
comprises a core member, a compressive mold, which is 
set to the other end side of the cylindrical molding 
box by way of moving itself back and forth, and a 
compressive mold drive means, which causes the 
compressive mold to movably protrude itself into the 
cylindrical molding box in order to compress supplied 
raw material. Finally a raw material supply means is 
provided for supplying raw material into the molding 
box, wherein the supply means is set to the other end 
side of the molding box. The method comprises several 
sequential steps, wherein in a first step dry raw 
material consisting of natural fibers is fed to the 
inner space of the molding box from the other end by 
a volume corresponding to plural times the volume of 
a molded body. In the next step a compressive mold is 
inserted from the other end of the molding box. Next 
the compressive mold is shifted to one side to 
compress the raw material between the compressive 
mold and the receiver mold. In a final step the raw 
material is compressively molded by means of the 
molding box, the core, and the compressive mold. Further to innovate cushioning material capable of 
replacing conventional cushioning material made from 
synthetic resin, molded pulp material made from 
recy
