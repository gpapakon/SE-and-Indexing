<ABSTRACT>
This invention relates to polymers having enhanced hydrophilicity and thermal regulative properties. Exemplary polymers include aliphatic polyamide polymers and polyester polymers. The polymer has bonded thereto a hydrophilic polysiloxane having an affinity for the polymer and having a molecular weight greater than about 1000 g/mol preferably greater than about 2000 g/mol, and preferably greater than about 4000 g/mol. The polymer has substantially no polymerization with the hydrophilic polysiloxane. Alternatively, an aliphatic polyamide polymer is provided having enhanced hydrophilicity and thermal regulative properties. The polymer has bonded thereto an anionic hydrophilic polysiloxane having an affinity for the aliphatic polyamide polymer. The aliphatic polyamide polymer has substantially no polymerization with the anionic hydrophilic siloxane.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to polymers having
enhanced hydrophilicity and thermal regulative
properties and a process of producing the same.Many polymers such as aliphatic polyamide polymers
(e.g., nylon) and polyester polymers are inherently
hydrophobic. Fabrics formed entirely from these
polymers tend to exhibit poor moisture absorption and
release properties and fail to provide thermal
regulative properties. Typically in apparel fabrics,
comfort is obtained by blending the aliphatic polyamide
or polyester polymer fibers with hydrophilic fibers
such as cotton fibers.There are also various recognized methods for
enhancing the hydrophilicity of the polymer. For
example, aliphatic polyamide and polyester polymers can
be treated with appropriate hydrophilic add-on agents
or coatings. However, these add-on agents or coatings
have not met with widespread acceptance particularly
due to the lack of permanence under repeated laundering
conditions.Another method of enhancing hydrophilicity is the
preparation of graft polymers of aliphatic polyamide
and polyester polymers and appropriate hydrophilic
comonomers. For example, U.S. Patent No. 4,135,877 to
Aikawa et al. proposes the graft polymerization of 
water-soluble vinyl monomers such as acrylic acid,
acrylamide and N,N'-methylene-bisacrylamide onto polyamide
fibers using heat and an aqueous treating solution
containing acid. The graft polymerization of hydrophobic
vinyl monomers with nylon, polypropylene and polyesters is
proposed in U.S. Patent No. 3,297,786 to Horowitz. See,
also, for example, U.S. Patent Nos. 3,099,631 to Tanner;
3,097,185 to Armen et al.; 3,252,880 to Magat et al.; and
3,278,639 to Matray. These graft polymerization
techniques, however, often alter the structure of the
aliphatic polyamide and polyester polymers. This can be
counterproductive in that such altering of the structure
results in the loss of other physical properties of the
polymer such as hand, fabric strength and thermal
regulative properties.Furthermore, EP-A-0313867 discloses
organopolysiloxanes with Bunte salt groups linked over the
carbon atoms. Methods are disclosed for the synthesis of
these compounds by the reaction of organopolysiloxane with
equimolar, in relation to the epoxy groups, amounts of
Me2S2O3 in which Me is an alkali metal or a substituted
ammonium group. The compounds may be used for the
permanent finishing of fibers or fiber products or for the
treatment of hair.Additionally, U.S. Patent No. 5,070,171 to O'Lenick
Jr. relates to a series of novel
