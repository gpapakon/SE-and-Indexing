<ABSTRACT>
A numerically controlled apparatus adapted to be moved in parallel with or perpendicularly to a designated shape for the 
purpose of producing a simple prototype easily by using a multipurpose machine tool. A graphic storage means (1) is adapted to 

display guidance information on a display unit (16) through a graphic control circuit (15), and store linear and arcuate designated 
shapes inputted thereinto interactively through an operation of a keyboard (17) by an operator. When an interpolation means (2) 

has detected a pulse signal HP outputted from a manual pulse generator (41), it reads a change-over signal H/V which is outputted 
from a change-over means, and which commands either a parallel motion or a perpendicular motion. The interpolation 

means (2) then outputs an interpolation pulse CP corresponding to the pulse signal HP and cange-over signal H/V, in accordance 
with the designated shape stored in the graphic storage means (1), and sends this pulse CP to an axis control circuit (18).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a numerical 
control apparatus and a numerical control method for controlling 
a machine tool, and more particularly to a numerical 
control apparatus and a numerical control method for 
controlling a machine tool which machines prototypes or the 
like. Advances in the technology of numerically controlled 
machine tools have been so great that they can 
machine workpieces of complex shape at high speed with 
precision. At present, workpieces of complex shape cannot 
be machined without numerically controlled machine tools. To generate machining programs, there are widely 
used interactive numerical control apparatus which comprise 
a numerical control apparatus with an interactive program 
generating function, and automatic programming apparatus 
for simply generating complex machining programs. In the use of such numerical control apparatus, 
it is necessary to accurately define machine coordinates, a 
machine origin, program coordinates, a machining origin,  
 
and other data for generating strict machining programs. 
Although the interactive numerical control apparatus and 
the automatic programming apparatus can be used to machine 
a number of workpieces, for some machining processes for 
producing a prototype or a model, general-purpose milling 
machines, lathes and the like are used which require a 
short period of time to carry out preparatory action such 
as attachment and detachment of workpieces, installation of 
tools, etc., and do not require machining programs to be 
generated. Problems of general-purpose machine tools are 
that the number of available operators who can handle 
general-purpose machine tools is becoming smaller, and it 
is difficult for the general-purpose machine tools to carry 
out oblique linear machining, arcuate machining, or the 
like though they can effect linear machining without any 
problem. If, on the other hand, a general numerically 
controlled machine tool is used to machine a prototype or a 
Omodel, then it is necessary to accurately define machine 
coordinates, a machine origin, program coordinates, a 
machining origin, and other data. While it is not impossible 
to define those data, the required programming process 
is too time-consuming and troublesome for machining a 
portion of a single workpiece. To solve the above problems, the applicant has  
 
filed Japanese Patent Application No. 4-231836 on a numerical 
control apparatus which employs a general-purpose 
machine tool for carrying out simple machining processes to 
mac
