<CLAIMS>
Use, as an additive for unleaded petrols to prevent
or reduce valve seat wear, of a neutral alkali metal and/or

alkaline-earth metal salt of a mono- or diester of
sulphosuccinic acid of the general formula (I)



wherein R
1
 and R
2
, independently of each other, represent
hydrogen or an aliphatic hydrocarbon group, on condition that

at most one of the residues R
1
 or R
2
 signifies hydrogen, M
represents an alkali metal or alkaline-earth metal ion and n

corresponds to the valency of M, combined with at least one
ash-free detergent and optionally other known additives.
Use, for the purpose mentioned in claim 1, of a salt
of a sulphosuccinic acid diester of the formula I mentioned

in claim 1 combined with an ash-free detergent.
Use, for the purpose mentioned in claim 1, of a salt
of a sulphosuccinic acid ester of the formula I mentioned in

claim 1, in which the ester groups consist of hydrocarbon
residues with from 4 to 20 carbon atoms, combined with an

ash-free detergent.
Use, for the purpose mentioned in claim 1, of a salt
of a sulphosuccinic acid ester of the formula I mentioned in

claim 1, in which the ester groups consist of hydrocarbon
residues with from 6 to 13 carbon atoms, combined with an

ash-free detergent. 
Use, for the purpose mentioned in claim 1, of a salt
of a sulphosuccinic acid ester of the formula I mentioned in

claim 1, in which the ester groups consist of hydrocarbon
residues with 8 carbon atoms, combined with an ash-free

detergent.
Use, for the purpose mentioned in claim 1, of an
alkali metal salt of a sulphosuccinic acid ester of the

formula I mentioned in claim 1 combined with an ash-free
detergent.
Use, for the purpose mentioned in claim 1, of a
potassium salt of a sulphosuccinic acid ester of the formula

I mentioned in claim 1 combined with an ash-free detergent.
Use, for the purpose mentioned in claim 1, of an
alkali metal and/or alkaline-earth metal salt of a

sulphosuccinic acid ester of the formula I mentioned in claim
1 combined with a detergent based on polybutene amine.
Use, for the purpose mentioned in claim 1, of an
alkali metal and/or alkaline-earth metal salt of a

sulphosuccinic acid ester of the formula I mentioned in claim
1 combined with a detergent based on polyether amine.
Use, for the purpose mentioned in claim 1, of an
alkali metal and/or alkaline-earth metal salt of a

sulphosuccinic acid ester of the formula I mentioned in claim
1 combined with an ash-free detergent with a molecular weight

of from 2000 to 3000.
Use, for the purpose mentioned in claim 1, of a
potassium salt of a sulphosuccinic acid ester of the formula

I mentioned in claim 1 combined with an ash-free detergent in
a weight ratio of 1:(8-15). 
Use, for the purpose mentioned in claim 1, of a
mixture of from 4 wt.% to 9 wt.% alkali metal salt of a

sulphosuccinic acid ester of the formula I mentioned in claim
1 and from 60 wt.% to 80 wt.% ash-free detergent, the weight

being made up to 100 % with carrier oil and/or diluent.
Use, for the purpose mentioned in claim 1, of a
mixture containing a potassium salt of a sulphosuccinic acid

ester of the formula I mentioned in claim 1 and an ash-free
detergent, potassium being present in an amount of from

0.2 wt.% to 0.7 wt.%.
