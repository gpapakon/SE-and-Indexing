<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a method for securely transmitting data between a
client and a server. A communication system 250 has a server 252 coupled to a

network. The server (252) is also connected to a client A (254) through a
narrowband channel A (NBCA) (258) and a wideband channel A (WBCA) (260),

and to a client B (256) through a narrowband channel (NBCB) (262) and a
wideband channel B (WBCB) (264). The client and server are connected over the

wideband channel and security information is exchanged. Then, data to be
transmitted from the server to the client is encrypted using the security

information at the server prior to transmission of the encrypted data from the
server to the client over the narrowband channel.

<DESCRIPTION>
This application is related to U.S. Application No. 09/071,235, filed April 30, 1998, and entitled "METHOD AND SYSTEM FOR INTEGRATING NARROWBAND AND WIDEBAND DATA TRANSPORTS". This application is also related to U.S. Application No. 09/070,668, filed April 30, 1998, and entitled "METHOD AND APPARATUS FOR PROVIDING NETWORK ACCESS OVER DIFFERENT WIRELESS NETWORKS".The present invention relates to wireless networks, and more particularly,
to secure data transmissions over wireless networks.Wireless networks are often used to transmit messages from one location
in a network to a destination location in the network. These messages contain
data to be supplied to the destination location. More specifically, the messages
include a header portion and a data portion. The header portion includes an
address of the destination location, and the data portion contains data. The
destination location is, for example, a mobile device or a server. A mobile device
typically interacts with wireless networks to receive various types of notifications
or to request and receive data from another network to which the wireless
network is connected.FIG. 1 is a block diagram of a conventional wireless communication
network 100. The wireless communication system 100 includes a sever 102, a 
wireless network 104, and mobile devices 106. There are n mobile devices 106-1
through 106-n. The server 102 is typically a computer system that operates to
send and receive messages to and from the mobile devices 106. The messages
are often blocks of data that are to be transmitted to the mobile device 106. As
examples, the data can pertain to various types of notifications, electronic mail,
news data, configuration information, data files, library files, program files, etc.
The messages can also be requests for information (e.g., certain data) that are
transmitted from the mobile devices 106 to the server 102. The server 102 may
also connect to other wired or wireless networks to receive messages from or
forward messages to other computer systems. As an example, the server 102can
be connected to the Internet. For example, the server 102 can be a proxy server
(or link server) coupled to the Internet or a network gateway coupled to a
network. The tremendous growth of the Internet in recent years has fuelled the
need to provide mobile devices such as mobile telephones, personal digital
assistants (PDAs) and the like with access to information and services available
on the Internet.The wireless network 104 typically uses radio transmissions to
commu

encrypting data to be transmitted from the server (252) to the client (254, 256) using the
security information at the server (252) ; and
transmitting the encrypted data from the server (252) to the client (254, 256) over the
narrowband channel (258, 262).
A method as recited in claim 1 wherein said encrypting comprises:

forming a server-side narrowband channel key block based at least in part
on the security information at the server (252); and
encrypting the data to be transmitted from the server (252) to the client (254, 256) using the
server-side narrowband channel key block.
A method as recited in claim 1 or 2 wherein said method further
comprises:-


forming a client-side narrowband channel key block based at least in part
on the security information at the client (254, 256);
receiving the encrypted data that has been transmitted from the server (252) to
the client (254, 256) over the narrowband channel (258, 262); and
decrypting the encrypted data that has been received from the server (252) over
the narrowband channel (258, 262).
A method as recited in any preceding claim wherein said method further
comprises:-


transmitting different portions of the encrypted data from the server (252) to the
