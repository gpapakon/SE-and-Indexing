<ABSTRACT>
This invention relates to fluorochemical compositions, their preparation and their use as water-and oil-repellents, and substrates treated therewith. The fluorochemical composition comprises a mixture of fluorochemical compounds and/or polymers, each component having at least two fluoroaliphatic groups and a large hydrocarbon moiety such as derived from dimer acids, and the polymer having at least one fluoroaliphatic group and a plurality of said hydrocarbon moiety.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to fluorochemical 
compositions comprising fluoroaliphatic dimer acid 
derivatives, their preparation, their use as water and 
oil repellents in treating substrates, such as leather, 
textiles and paper, and to the resulting treated 
substrates. It is common to treat the surfaces of leather, 
textiles, and other substrates to impart added desirable 
properties thereto, such as oil and water repellency and 
resistance to dry or oily soil. A number of 
fluorochemical compositions have been proposed for such 
treatment and several are commercially used for that 
purpose, such as those sold under the tradename 
"Scotchgard." Various patents and publications disclose 
a variety of such compositions for various uses, e.g. 
U.S. Pat. Nos. 3,462,296 (Raynolds et al.), 3,484,281 
(Guenthner et al.), 3,816,167 (Schultz et al.), 3,944,527 
(McCown), 4,024,178 (Landucci), 4,190,545 (Marshall et 
al.), 4,215,205 (Landucci) and 4,426,476 (Chang), 
Japanese published patent application (Kokai) No. 
81-49081, and Banks, R.E., Ed., "Organofluorine Chemicals 
and their Industrial Applications," pages 226-230 (Ellis 
Harwood, Ltd., West Sussex, England, 1979). Also various 
patents disclose carpet treating compositions containing, 
inter alia, various fluorochemicals, e.g. U.S. Pat. Nos. 
3,923,715 (Dettre et al.), 4,043,964 (Sherman et al.), 
4,107,055 (Sukornick et al.), 4,264,484 (Patel), Re 
30,337 (Loudas), 4,388,372 (Champaneria) and 4,325,857 
(Champaneria). Also various patents and publications 
disclose the use of fluorochemical compositions on 
leather, e.g., U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,920,190 (Lina et al.), 
4,782,175, (Wehowsky et al.), 4,778,915 (Lina et al), 
4,539,006 (Langford), 3,923,715 (Dettre et al.), 
4,709,074 (Bathelt et al.) and L. Schl√∂sser  
 
"Eigenschaften fluororganischer Verbindungen und ihre 
Anwendung auf dem Ledergebiet," DAS LEDER, 41 Jahrgang 
August 1990, pages 149-153. U.S. Pat. No. 3,923,715 (Dettre et al.) describes 
an aqueous dispersion containing at least 5 weight 
percent of a perfluoroalkyl ester made from a fluorinated 
alcohol and a mono- or polycarboxylic acid which contains 
3 to 30 carbon atoms. The dispersion is applied to 
textile fibers in order to insure dry soil resistance and 
non-flame propagating characteristics. U.S. Pat. No. 4,426,476 (Chang et al.) relates to 
a textile treatment composition containing 
water-insoluble fluoroaliphatic radical and aliphatic 
chlorine-containing ester and water-insoluble 
fluoroaliphatic radical-containing polymer. The
