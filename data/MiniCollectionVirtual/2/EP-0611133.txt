<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to the process of preparing 
absorbable polymers that are used in the manufacture of 
Internal Bone Fixation Devices and Implants. These devices 
are generally made of polymers with very high molecular 
weight polyL(-)lactide and copolymers of lactide and other 
poly(alpha-hydroxy acid esters). Medical products such as synthetic absorbable sutures, 
bone plates, bone pins and screws made from absorbable 
polymers have been known for some time. These products 
are generally made from alpha hydroxy polyester polymers. 
The advantage of the use of synthetic absorbable polymers 
for internal bone fixation devices is the fact that it is 
not necessary to perform a second surgical procedure to 
remove such fixation devices after they have accomplished 
their purpose. U.S. Patent Numbers 3,463,158; 3,636,956; 
3,739,773; 3,797,499 and 3,839,297 disclose bone fixation 
devices made from synthetic polymers which are either 
polylactides, polyglycolides or copolymers of lactide and 
glycolide. U.S. Patent 4,550,449 discloses absorbable bone fixation 
devices made from very high molecular weight polymers and 
copolymers containing L(-)lactide monomers as well as 
copolymers of L(-)lactide with minor amounts i.e. 10% or 
less of compatible comonomers. The comonomers include 
Alpha-hydroxypropanoic acid Alpha-hydroxyacetic acid  
 beta-propiolactide tetramethylglycolide beta-butyrolactone gamma-butyrolactone pivalolactone alpha-hydroxybutyric acid alpha-hydroxyisobutyric acid alpha-hydroxyvaleric acid alpha-hydroxyisovaleric acid alpha-hydroxycarpoic acid alpha-hydroxyisocaproic acid alpha-hydroxy-alpha-ethylbutyric acid alpha-hydroxy-beta-methylvaleric acid alpha-hydroxyheptanoic acid alpha-hydroxyoctanoic acid alpha-hydroxydecanoic acid alpha-hydroxymyristic acid alpha-hydroxystearic acid dimethylglycolide polymethylglycolide diethylglycolide dibutylglycolide caprolactone valerolactone decalactone propiolactone dioxanone substituted dioxanones trimethylene carbonate ethylene carbonate propylene carbonate The polymers disclosed in U.S. Patent 4,550,449 differ 
from the polymers disclosed in the earlier mentioned  
 
patents in that the molecular weight of the polymers 
disclosed in U.S. Patent 4,550,449 is much higher than the 
molecular weight of the polymers disclosed in the other 
patents. It has also been known that the presence of unreacted 
monomer in polymers of this type tends to accelerate the 
breakdown of the polymers when the polymers are implanted 
in an animal body. U.S.
</DESCRIPTION>
<CLAIMS>
Process of purification and stabilization of a high 
molecular weight polylactide comprising reducing the 

polylactide into small particles contacting the 
polylactide particles with dried methyl alcohol for a 

period of at least 10 hours at room temperature, filtering 
the polylactide particles to separate the methyl alcohol 

from the particles, and contacting the polylactide 
particles with dry acetone for a period of at least 10 

hours at room temperature, filtering the polylactide 
particles to remove the acetone and drying the PLA 

particles and storing the polylactide in an inert 
atmosphere. 
The process of claim 1 in which the polylactide is 
reduces to particles having a size of less than 10 

millimeters. 
The process of claim 2 in which the polylactide is 
reduces to particles having a size of from 1 to 6 

millimeters. 
The process of claim 1 in which the polylactide 
particles are contacted with methyl alcohol for 24 hours.
