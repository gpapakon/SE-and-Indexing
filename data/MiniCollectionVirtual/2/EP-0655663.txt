<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an 
electrostatic latent image-developing device used for 
an image-forming machine such as an electrostatic 
copying machine or a laser printer. More 
specifically, the invention relates to an 
electrostatic latent image-developing device of a 
type which is replenished with toner by renewing a 
toner cartridge, and to the toner cartridge used for 
such an electrostatic latent image-developing device. In an electrostatic latent image-developing 
device used in an image-forming machine, toner is 
imparted to an electrostatic latent image that is 
formed on a photosensitive material in order to 
develop it into a toner image. Therefore, the toner 
is consumed as the developing is continued, and the 
electrostatic latent image-developing device must be 
replenished with the toner after the developing has 
been executed many times. The toner is required to 
be replenished by means of an easy operation and for 
this purpose, in general, a toner replenishing system 
is employed according to which a toner cartridge is 
renewed to replenish the toner. The electrostatic 
latent image-developing device that employs the above 
toner replenishing system has a toner cartridge-holding 
means in which the toner cartridge is 
detachably held. The toner cartridge-holding means 
has an opening for receiving the toner. The toner 
cartridge includes a container having a toner 
discharge opening, toner contained in the container, 
and a sealing means for sealing the toner discharge  
 
opening. Usually, the toner discharge opening is 
formed in the lower wall of the container, and the 
sealing means is constituted by a tape member which 
is stuck to the lower wall of the container in a 
manner that it can be peeled off. When the toner 
cartridge is mounted on a predetermined mounting 
position of the toner cartridge-holding means, the 
toner discharge opening of the toner cartridge is 
positioned to face the opening for receiving the 
toner of the toner cartridge-holding means. After 
the toner cartridge is mounted on the predetermined 
position of the toner cartridge-holding means, the 
tape member is peeled off the container to open the 
toner discharge opening. Then, the toner in the 
container is discharged into the toner-receiving 
opening through the toner discharge opening, so that 
the electrostatic latent image-developing device is 
replenished with the toner. The tape member is 
peeled off the container usually by gripping its end 
and pulling it off. When the toner is consumed
