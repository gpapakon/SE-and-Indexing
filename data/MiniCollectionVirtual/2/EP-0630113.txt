<ABSTRACT>
A new logic family is identified that achieves much better speeds than CML 
logic gates. This new logic family operates with multiple inputs and a single logic 

level, using differential pairs of transistors for each input transistor of the multiple 
input. This new logic family enables high speed operation, or higher speed, than the 

prior art, together with lower operating current and a power-delay enhancement 
significantly increased over the prior art.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to an integrated logic circuit with differential pairs of
inputs for supplying complementary signals.US patent No. 3,655,998 discloses a circuit with two input transistors, each
having a control electrode coupled to a logic input from a different differential pair of inputs.
Current from a current source is conducted either through the main current channel of a
reference transistor or through main current channels of the input transistors, dependent on the
logic signals at the control electrodes of the input transistors.The complements of the signals used to control the control electrodes of the
input transistors are used to control the voltage at the control electrode of the reference
transistor. If any one of those logic signals makes the main current channel of the
corresponding input transistor conduct, the voltage at the control electrode of the reference
transistor is made to change in the opposite direction, so as to make the reference transistor
less conductive.This circuit is susceptible to noise when the voltage level at the inputs may
vary, even if the logic state of the input signals (their difference) remains substantially the
same.Another circuit is 
known from US 4,877,977 and is shown in Figure 1. This circuit furthermore
comprises a first resistor, the main current channel of the reference transistor being
coupled to the supply voltage terminal via the first resistor. A node between this main
current channel and the first resistor forms an output O of the circuit. The main current
channels of the input transistors may be coupled to the supply voltage terminal via a
second resistor, a node between these main current channels and the second resistor
forming a further output, complementary to the first mentioned output.In operation, when the voltage level at any one of the input connections A-D of
this circuit becomes higher than that (VREF) at the reference input REF, the voltage at
the output O will become logic high. Hence the circuit may be used as an OR gate.This circuit is susceptible to noise, especially from the voltage supply. In this
case, although the logic state of the signals at the inputs A-D does not change, the
voltage level at these inputs A-D may vary, for example when the voltage supply
relative to which they are defined varies. This problem is aggravated in the case of
high-speed logic in which small signal-swings are required.As a more complicated alternative, use is made of Current-mode logic (CML)
circuitry, such as shown in Colace, Electronic
