<ABSTRACT>
An integrated telephone call handling system and 
method are disclosed. The system comprises a unified 

software control for controlling a call between the 
system and a party, the unified control capable of 

transferring the call among functional partitions 
within the system, the functional partitions providing 

mechanized communication via the network and capable of 
directing communications between the party and a 

selected one of the functional partitions. The unified 
control includes a unified script language to allow 

unified scripting of a call from inception to 
termination, including scripting of interaction between 

the party and an agent.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates in general to agent-based
telephone communication systems and more particularly
to a computer-based system architecture that allows
integration of voice, text, image and call processing
with an agent-based call center, all under control of a
single, unified software control system.A prior art telephone answering system with integrated voice and textual
message storage is known from WO 90/03700. Further, EP-A-0501189
discloses a system for integrating telephony data with data processing systems. Over the years, various systems have been
developed to operate in conjunction with public and
private switching telephone networks to provide
specialized functions that lend power, versatility and
efficiency to telecommunications.These various systems are designed to operate on
data in one or more of three general categories: voice,
text and image. Together, these types of data
encompass all data currently desired to be processed or
transmitted in communication systems.The above-described data can be processed or
communicated in ways that can be generally categorized
as "mail" (also termed "store and forward"),
"interactive" and "bulletin" systems. Mail systems
allow a user to retrieve voice, text or images that
have been exclusively addressed to the user. In such
mail systems, it is typical to require the user to
enter a unique password to gain access to the
exclusively-addressed data. Interactive systems allow
a user to control what data the interactive system
delivers to the user, and, perhaps, in what order the
data is delivered. Unlike mail systems, however, the
data need not be exclusively-addressed, and thus can be
publicly available. Lastly, bulletin systems allow a
user to retrieve publicly available information in a
non-interactive, system-controlled fashion.One type of system directed to handling of data is
automatic call distribution ("ACD"), wherein a pool of
agents is assigned to answer calls incoming on a
particular group of telephone lines. ACD systems
handle these calls as they arrive, assigning them to
agents in the order received and choosing the agents 
based on length of idle time. This algorithm of
queueing is called "fair queueing." Because human
agents are present, such ACD systems are interactive.Another such system is audio text (or "audio
tex"). Audio text system are designed to "play" a
message stored in a memory device to a person listening
on the other end of the call. These systems are
generally not interactive and can be bulletin systems.Yet another such
