<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention generally concerns a process for
preparing aluminum nitride (AlN) powder. The present
invention more particularly concerns preparing AlN powder
that has a surface area greater than 10 square meters per
gram (m2/g), desirably greater than 15 m2/g.Aluminum nitride synthesis generally occurs via one of
four known processes. One process involves carbothermally
reducing and nitriding alumina
(Al2O3 + 3C + N2 → 2AlN + 3CO).
A second process directly reacts aluminum metal with
nitrogen
(2Al + N2 → 2AlN).
A less common process reacts aluminum chloride and ammonia in a vapor phase
(AlCl3 + 4NH3 → AlN + 3NH4Cl).
US-A-3,128,153 discloses an even less
common process wherein aluminum phosphide reacts with
ammonia
(AlP + NH3 → AlN + 1/4P4 + 3/2H2).The carbothermal reduction reaction is endothermic and
requires approximately 335 kilojoules per gram-mole of AlN
at 1873 K. The reaction is generally carried out at a
temperature within a range of 1673 to 1973 K as disclosed
by Kuramoto et al. in US-A-4,618,592. The resultant AlN
powder is fine enough to allow consolidation to near
theoretical density via pressureless sintering in the
presence of sintering aids. Higher temperatures generally
result in the formation of sintered agglomerates of AlN
particles. The agglomerates are not amenable to
densification by pressureless sintering.The direct reaction of aluminum metal to AlN is
exothermic and generates approximately 328 kilojoules per
gram-mole of AlN at 1800 K. Aluminum metal melts at about
933 K. The reaction of aluminum and nitrogen starts at
about 1073 K. The reaction, once initiated, is self-propagating 
if not controlled. An uncontrolled reaction
can reach AlN sintering temperatures and remain at these
temperatures for extended periods of time. The
uncontrolled reaction typically yields sintered AlN
agglomerates having a surface area, as determined by
Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) analysis, of less than 2 m2/g.
The agglomerates are not readily amenable to further
sintering to densities approaching theoretical density via
pressureless sintering techniques.One variation of the direct nitridation process
employs plasma reactors to vaporize aluminum metal at
temperatures approaching 10,000 K. The vaporized metal
then reacts with nitrogen, ammonia, or mixtures of nitrogen
and ammonia or nitrogen and hydrogen. The resultant AlN
powder particles have an average particle size of less than
0.1 micrometer (µm) and a surface area of approximately 30
m2/g. These particles can be pressureless sintered to
