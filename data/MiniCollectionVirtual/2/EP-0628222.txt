<ABSTRACT>
An automotive battery switching and distribution system which includes a battery system in combination with an integrated power switching system, for providing protection for the battery system by synchronizing the battery system's discharge rate with the electrochemical reactions of the battery system. The battery system has at least two discharge characteristics, one capable of short high current discharge of electric power for cranking an internal combustion engine, and the other for providing a lower rate of current discharge as required for vehicle auxiliary power. The power switching system acts in response to increased voltage or current levels to connect or disconnect the battery with related loads or power sources as necessary for optimum battery protection and system operation. Each portion of the battery system is separately connected to the electrical system of the automobile so that draining one portion of the battery system will not affect the electrical system that is connected to the other portion of the battery system.

<DESCRIPTION>
AUTOMOTIVE POWER DISTRIBUTION AND SWITCHING SYSTEMTECHNICAL FIELDThe present invention relates to Automobile Electrical Power Distribution and Switching Systems.PACKQRQW APThe prior art discloses conventional automobiles utilizing internal combustion engines started by electric starter motors. The starter motor cranks the engine and an electrical ignition system. Power for cranking and ignition is provided by a lead acid storage battery commonly referred to as a Starting, Lighting and Ignition (SLI) Battery. After the engine starts, the vehicle's battery is recharged by a power generator driven by the internal combustion engine. The power generator in modern vehicles utilizes alternating current for efficiency. The alternating current is "rectified" to provide direct current to most electrical consumers throughout the vehicle. The direct current also is used to reÂ¬ charge the battery. The charging unit of a modern vehicle is commonly referred to as the Alternator.The alternator usually provides sufficient current to run the electrical consumers when the engine is operating. The battery acts as a "load levelling" device to ensure smooth and constant direct current throughout the vehicle's electrical network.When the vehicle's engine is not operating, power to the various electrical consumers must be provided by the SLI battery. For safety and other reasons, the SLI battery should provide a minimum amount of reserve power to operate the headlights, ignition and window wipers. For example, if the alternator of the vehicle should fail at night, while it is raining, the vehicle's SLI battery should provide a minimum amount of power to operate the vehicle's lights, wipers, and ignition system for a specified period of time. Preferably, the user should be able to drive the vehicle for between 30 and 100 minutes with a failed alternator.Worldwide standards have been established to measure an SLI battery's "reserve capacity" for supplying electrical power to important consumers when the alternator system fails. Generally, the vehicle manufacturer chooses a particular SLI battery based upon established standards applied to a particular vehicle's full specifications and electrical load requirements. 

An important safety consideration regarding the vehicle's battery capacity is the amount of power provided by the battery during times of emergency. In times of emergency, the vehicle user will normally activate park lights or hazard lights as a warning to oncoming traffic. The vehicle's engine may not be operable at
