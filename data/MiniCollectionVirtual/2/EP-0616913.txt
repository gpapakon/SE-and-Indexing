<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a vehicle with electric drive and a high-temperature battery which serves to supply it with energy and has a thermally insulated housing in order to avoid thermal losses and a cooling system in order to limit the operating temperature during charging and when drawing off current. The dissipated heat of the cooling system is used to heat the vehicle. In this context there is provision for the vehicle to be preheated during the charging of the battery so that during travel mode it is only necessary to maintain the level of heat of the passenger compartment of the vehicle. Thus, it is possible to heat comfortably even with low overall absorption rates of the cooling system.

High-temperature battery (1), in particular for
supplying power to vehicles with electric drive, having

a thermally insulating housing (2) in order to avoid
thermal losses and a cooling system in order to limit the

operating temperature during charging of the battery and
during the power drain, characterized in that in order to

remove heat from the battery (1), a cooling element (3)
through which air flows is arranged inside the thermally

insulating battery housing (2) is hermetically sealed and
only penetrates the thermally insulating wall of the

battery housing (2) with air inlet and air outlet
connecting elements (4, 5) arranged on it, the cooling

element being essentially in the form of a plate-shaped
hollow element.
High-temperature battery according to Claim 1,
characterized in that the plate-shaped hollow element is

arranged horizontally above or below the cells of the
high-temperature battery.
High-temperature battery according to Claim 1,
characterized in that arranged within the cooling element

(3) are air baffles (6, 7) by means of which the air fed
by the air inlet connecting element (4) is distributed

within the cooling element (3) in such a way that all the
regions of the cooling element (3) have a cooling effect

in approximately the same way.
High-temperature battery according to Claim 3,
characterized in that the air baffles (6, 7) are arranged

in such a way that essentially an air passage which 
extends in the direction of flow is produced for the

through-flowing air.
High-temperature battery according to Claim 4,
characterized in that the inlet connecting element (4) is

arranged centrally and between the two outlet connecting
elements (5) on the narrow side of the cooling element

(3).
High-temperature battery according to Claims 4
and 5, characterized in that the air flowing in through

the inlet connecting element (4) is divided up within the
plate-shaped cooling element at its end and is diverted

into two air passages which are located on the outside,
are formed by air baffles (6) and the walls of the

cooling element and feed the air to the two outlet
connecting elements (5).
High-temperature battery according to Claim 6,
characterized in that arcuate air baffles (7) are

provided to deflect the air at the end of the cooling
element.
