<ABSTRACT>
The present invention provides a new image forming 
method. The image forming method uses a light-sensitive 

material. The light-sensitive material comprises a support 
and a light-sensitive polymerizable layer. The light-sensitive 

polymerizable layer contains silver halide, a reducing 
agent and an ethylenically unsaturated polymerizable 

compound or a cross-linkable polymer. Any of the silver 
halide, the reducing agent, the polymerizable compound and 

the polymer are not encapsulated in the layer. The image 
forming method comprising the steps of imagewise exposing 

to light the light-sensitive material and simultaneously or 
thereafter heating the light-sensitive material at a temperature 

of not lower than 70 °C. At the heat development, 
the silver halide is developed and the polymerizable compound 

or the cross-linkable polymer is hardened. Thus, a 
hardened image is formed on the light-sensitive material. 

The heat development is conducted while covering a surface 
of the light-sensitive polymerizable layer with a sheet or 

a heating means. According to the present invention, a 
space of 0.5 to 500 µm intervenes between the surface of 

the light-sensitive polymerizable layer and the surface of 
the sheet or the heating means.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an image forming
method comprising the steps of imagewise exposing to light
a light-sensitive material, and simultaneously or thereafter
heating the light-sensitive material to form a hardened
image on the light-sensitive material.U.S. Patent No. 4,629,676 (Hayakawa et al) and
European Patent Publication No. 0174634B1 disclose an image
forming method comprising the steps of imagewise exposing
to light a light-sensitive material that comprises a support
and a light-sensitive layer containing silver halide,
a reducing agent and a polymerizable compound, and simultaneously
or thereafter heating the light-sensitive material
to develop the silver halide and harden the polymerizable
compound. The silver halide, the reducing agent and the
polymerizable compound are preferably contained in microcapsules
that are dispersed in the light-sensitive polymerizable
layer. According to the method, a hardened image is
easily formed on the light-sensitive material by the heat
development. Further, the sensitivity of the light-sensitive
material is very high because silver halide is used as
a photosensor.The heat development is convenient and advantageous
compared with a wet development using a developing solution.
However it is rather difficult to control the conditions
of the heat development (e.g., temperature, time and
heating means). For example, the hardness of the obtained 
image is sometimes insufficient when the light-sensitive
material is heated while the surface of the light-sensitive
layer is open to the air. Oxygen in the air has a function
of inhibiting a polymerization reaction. The most convenient
way of preventing the influence of oxygen is to heat
the light-sensitive material while pressing the surface of
the light-sensitive layer on the surface of a heating
means.U.S. Patent No. 4,945,025 (Nakamura) discloses a
light-sensitive material having a cover sheet. The sheet
covers the surface of the light-sensitive layer to prevent
the influence of oxygen.By the way, the above-mentioned image forming method
is available for forming a lithographic plate or a color
proof.U.S. Patent No. 5,122,443 (Takeda) and European Patent
Publication No. 0426192B1 disclose a method of forming a
lithographic plate. Further, U.S. Patent Application
Serial No. 07/878,996, which is now allowed (Yokoya et al)
and German Patent Publication No. 4215035A1 disclose a
method of forming a color proof. In the method of forming
a lithographic plate or a color proof, a cross-linkable
polymer may be used in
