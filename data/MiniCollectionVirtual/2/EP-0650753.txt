<ABSTRACT>
A backwashable filter device has a filter (10) arranged coaxially to a housing (8) and between an inlet and an outlet (1, 3), through which filter, in normal mode, the flow passes from the outside to the inside and in backwash mode the flow passes at least in sections from the inside to the outside. A backwash channel (16) abutts the filter (10), which backwash channel is coupled to an impeller (13), so that when an outlet valve (22) is opened, the impeller (13) is impinged by flow and the backwash channel (16) is set in rotation so that the filter (10) is cleaned in sections.

Back-flushable filtering device, in particular for a
house water installation, comprising a filter (10) being

arranged coaxially to a housing between an inlet (1) and
an outlet (3), which in its normal operational mode is

flown through from the outside to the inside and in its
back-flushing operational mode at least by sectors is

flown through from the inside to the outside, a venting
valve (22) being operable for initiating the back-flushing,

and at least a rinsing channel (16) leading to
the venting valve, whereat the filter and the rinsing

channel are rotatable relative to each other,
characterized in that
a) a turbine blade wheel (13) is coupled to the rinsing
channel (16) and is arranged in the rinsing water,
b) the turbine blade wheel (13) is unitary with the
rinsing channel (16) and a bottom (14), which

interrupts the direct connection between the inlet
(1) and the venting valve (22),
c) the bottom (14) is perforated in the area of the
rinsing channel (16),
d) a wall (17) of the rinsing channel (16) directed
against said filter (10) comprises a paraxial

throughslot (19), and
e) the turbine blade wheel (13) is connected to the
rinsing channel (16) in its upper range.
Filtering device according to claim 1, 
characterized in
that
 the bottom (14) at least on a place outside of the
rinsing channel (16) comprises a perforation (33).
Filtering device according to claim 1, 
characterized in
that
 the rinsing channel (16) at its upper side is closed
by the bottom of a cover (18).
Filtering device according to one of claims 1 to 3,

characterized in that
 two rinsing channels (16, 16') 
offset around the periphery by 180Â° are arranged, which

below the filter (10) are connected to each other and
that the turbine blade wheel (13') is arranged between

the rinsing channels (16, 16') connected to each other
and the venting valve (22).
Filtering device according to one of the preceding claims
1 to 4, 
characterized in that
 the unit consisting of the
turbine blade wheel (13) and the rinsing channel (16) is

supported by a bearing (27) being movable against the
force of a spring in order to prevent during normal

filter operation rotation of the unit by abutting against
a stop collar (12) and to allow during back-flushing

operation the rotation of the unit.
Filtering device according to claim 5, 
characterized in
that
 the mounting of the unit consisting of the turbine
blade wheel (13) and the rinsing channel (16) as well as

the bottom (14) is provided by a central bearing (20).
Filtering claim according to claim 1 or one of the
following claims, 
characterized in that
 one wall (15) of
the rinsing channel (16) is formed as a wiper, which

during rotation of the rinsing channel cleans the inner
wall of the housing (8).
Filtering device according to claim 1 and 5,

characterized in that
 below the bottom (14) and spaced
from said bottom a further bottom (24) is stationarily

arranged, against which the bearing (27) and the bottom
(14) are supported by a spring (26) and being axially

displaceable.
Filtering device according to claim 8, 
characterized in
that
 the further bottom (24) is provided with apertures
(25). 
Filtering device according to claim 9, 
characterized in
that
 the further bottom (24) comprises a concentrical and
upright collar (30), which together with the overlying

bottom (14) and the inner wall of the housing (5) is
forming a ring channel (31) into which projections of the

walls (15) of the rinsing channel (16) are dipping
through the bottom (14), whereat the further bottom (24)

at this spot is provided with a perforation (32).
