<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a surface-treatment 
composition that cures rapidly at the surface of a 
substrate and forms thereon a film which exhibits an 
excellent water repellency, oil repellency, and stain 
resistance. It is known that surface-treatment 
compositions based on fluorine-containing organosilicon 
compounds impart water repellency, oil repellency, and 
stain resistance to the surfaces of substrates. JP-A 
58-172245 teaches a surface-treatment composition that 
consists of perfluoroalkyl-containing silane (or its 
partial hydrolysis and condensation product) and a 
silane compound. JP-A 2-55781 Similarly describes a 
surface-treatment composition that consists of a 
fluorine-containing organosilicon compound (or its 
partial hydrolysis and condensation product) and an 
organoperoxide. Finally, surface-treatment 
compositions composed of perfluoroalkyl-containing 
silanes are disclosed in JP-A 2-138286, 2-311485, and 
3-77892. However, the surface-treatment composition 
taught in JP-A 58-172245 has a poor curability at the 
surface of the substrate because it cures by hydrolysis 
and condensation reactions of only Si-bonded alkoxy 
groups. Moreover, the film formed by this surface-treatment 
composition has an unsatisfactory water 
repellency, oil repellency, and stain resistance. The 
case of the surface-treatment composition taught in 
JP-A 2-55781, forms a film on the substrate surface 
that has a poor durability. Finally, the surface-treatment 
compositions of JP-A(s) 2-138286, 2-311485, 
and 3-77892 are limited in their range of applications 
by their evolution of a hydrogen halide by-product when 
the substrate surface is treated.  The present invention introduces a surface-treatment 
composition that cures rapidly at the 
substrate surface to form thereon a film that exhibits 
an excellent water repellency, oil repellency, and 
stain resistance. Our invention provides surface-treatment 
composition comprising 
(A) a fluorine-containing organosilicon compound 
having the general formula 
 
wherein R¹ denotes a monovalent hydrocarbon group, 
excluding alkenyl groups, R² denotes a divalent organic 
group, a is 2 or 3, and m is an integer having a value 
of 4 to 12,
 
or the partial hydrolysis and condensation product 
thereof,
 
and (B) a catalytic quantity of a condensation-reaction 
catalyst. The fluorine-containing organosilicon 
compound (A) is the active ingredient in the present 
composition, and it has the general formula 
wherein R¹ denotes a monovalent hydrocarbon group,
