<ABSTRACT>
A bolt (4) provided on a female connector housing (1) is 
tightened relative to a nut (6), provided on a male connector 

housing (2), displacing the two connector housings relative to 
each other in a connecting direction, thereby fitting them 

together. An upwardly-extending, bar-like projection 
portion (7) is provided on the male connector housing (2). A 

detection member (9) is provided in an insertion hole (8) formed 
in the female connector housing (1). When the two connector 

housings are displaced relative to each other in the 
connecting direction, the projection pin (7) and the detection 

member (9) cooperate to indicate a fitting-completed 
condition, enabling easily perceived completion of the 

connection. Alternatively, the male and female connector 
housings include electrically engageable sensing elements 

that indicate the fitting-completed condition.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a connector in which two connector
housings are fitted together, and more particularly
to a connector in which a fitting-completed condition of
the two connector housings can be detected by a fitting indicator
such as a detection pin or electrical detector.In connectors, and particularly the type of connector
having many terminals, the force for fitting male and female
connector housings is large, so that a large force is
required for attaching and detaching them. To deal with
this, there has been proposed a so-called screw tightening-type
connector. In this construction, a bolt is rotatably
mounted, for example, on a female connector housing,
and a nut is mounted on a male connector housing. The bolt
is tightened relative to the nut, thereby fitting the two
connector housings together.Incidentally, the bolt tightening operation is carried
out using a tool such as an impact wrench. If the bolt is
tightened excessively, the bolt may be broken, or the housing
may be damaged. Therefore, in recent years, there has
been proposed a construction in which a threaded portion of
a bolt is provided partially on a distal end portion of a
bolt shaft, and in a fitting-completed condition of two
connector housings, the threaded portion of the bolt extends
forwardly from the nut, thereby freely rotating without
engagement with the nut. This prevents excessive tightening
of the bolt (see, for example, Japanese Patent Unexamined
Publication No. 63-13283).However, in the above construction in which the bolt
freely rotates in the fitting-completed condition of the
two connector housings, an excessive tightening of the bolt
is eliminated, but in a tightening operation by an impact
wrench, the operator cannot clearly perceive the degree of
tightening of the bolt. Accordingly, the operator may stop 
the tightening operation before the fitting-completed condition
of the two connector housings is achieved, that is,
in a so-called half-fitted condition.From US-A-4 629 351 a fitting indicating mechanism for
a screw type connector is known, the present invention
starts from. Said mechanism comprises a male connector
housing having an engaging portion; a female connector
housing having cavity means for receiving said engaging
portion therewithin; a tubular body having a bore contiguous
to said cavity means and a plurality of flexible support
arms extending into said bore toward a direction opposite
to said female connection housing; and an indicator
rod held to extend within said cavity means and said

<CLAIMS>
A connector including a first connector housing (1)
and a second conector housing (2), wherein a bolt (4) is

provided on said first connector housing (1), a nut (6) is
provided on said second connector housing (2), and by

tightening said bolt (4) relative to said nut (6), said
first and second connector housings (1, 2) are displaced

relative to each other in a connecting direction to be fitted
together, the connector furthermore comprises an indicator

disposed on one of said first and second connector
housings (1, 2), said indicator being displaced in accordance

with the displacement of said first and second connector
housings (1, 2) in the connection direction to indicate

a fitting-completed condition of said first and second
connector housings (1, 2),


wherein the connector further comprises:
a pin insertion aperture (8'; 12) formed in said first
connector housing (1) and having opposite open ends;
a fitting detection pin (9'; 11) having a resiliently
inwardly-deformable insertion piece (9a; 15b) at a distal

end thereof, said detection pin (9'; 11) being inserted
into said pin insertion aperture (8'; 12) from one end of

said pin insertion aperture; and
a projection portion (7'; 14) formed on said second
connector housing (2), said projection portion (7'; 14) being

inserted into said pin insertion aperture (8'; 12) from
the other end thereof in accordance with the displacement

of said first and second connector housings (1, 2) in the
connecting direction, said projection pin (7'; 14) retaining

said fitting detection pin (9'; 11) at a distal end
thereof to urge said detection pin toward the one end of

said pin insertion aperture (8'; 12),
wherein when said fitting detection pin (9'; 11) is
urged by said projection portion (7'; 14), said insertion

piece (9a; 15b) is gradually resiliently deformed inwardly, 
wherein furthermore in a fitting-uncompleted condition
of said first and second connector housings (1, 2), said

fitting detection pin (9'; 11) is retained from further insertion
by said projection portion (7'; 14), and in a fitting-completed

condition of said two connector housings (1,
2), the amount of deformation of the insertion piece (9a;

15b) is large, so that the retaining thereof by said projection
portion (7'; 14) is released, and therefore said

fitting detection pin (9'; 11) can be inserted within the
distal end of said projection portion (7'; 14).
The connector of claim 1, wherein said pin insertion
aperture (12) includes a first vertically extending

groove (12a) and an opposing second vertically extending
groove (12b), said second groove (12b) terminating at a retaining

wall portion (13) extending inward into said pin
insertion aperture (12).
The connector of claim 2, wherein said detection
pin (11) includes two inwardly deformable pawls (15b, 16a),

one pawl (16a) being engageable within said first groove
(12a) and guidable therealong and the other pawl (15b) being

engageable within said second groove (12b) and guidable
therealong.
The connector of claim 3, wherein said detection
pin (11) additionally includes a third pa
wl (15c) located
above said retaining wall portion (13), said detection pin

being restrained from movement within said pin insertion
aperture (12) by said third pawl (15c) being on one side of

said retaining wall portion and said first pawl (15b) being
located on an opposite side of said retaining wall portion.
The connector of claim 3, wherein said projection
portion (14) comprises an inclined surface for inwardly deforming

said first pawl (15b) in a fitting-completed condition, 
thereby allowing said detection pin (11) to freely

move within said pin insertion aperture.
The connector of claim 1, wherein said detection
pin (9') includes two bifurcated-extensible insertion

pieces (9a) at a distal end thereof, said insertion pieces
being spread apart in a fitting-uncompleted condition of

said first and second housings (1, 2), said insertion
pieces being gradually resiliently deformed inwardly by a

tapered portion (8b) of said pin insertion aperture (8') as
said housings (1, 2) are mated together, said insertion

pieces (9a) being deformed to a size in a fitting complete
condition that allows said detection pin (9') to be movable

within said pin insertion aperture to be inserted within
the distal end of said projection portion (7').
