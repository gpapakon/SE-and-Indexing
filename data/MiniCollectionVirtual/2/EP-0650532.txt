<ABSTRACT>
Subject boron carbide to a heat treatment at a temperature within a range of 1250  C to less than 1800  C prior to infiltration with a molten metal such as aluminum. This method allows control of kinetics of metal infiltration and chemical reactions, size of reaction products and connectivity of B4C grains and results in cermets having desired mechanical properties.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates generally to boron carbide/ 
aluminum cermets and their preparation. This invention 
relates more particularly to a method for preparing boron carbide/aluminum cermets 
having a controlled microstructure. US-A-4,605,440 discloses a process for preparing boron 
carbide/aluminum composites that includes a step of heating 
a powdered admixture of aluminum (Al) and boron carbide 
(B4C) at a temperature of 1050°C to 1200°C. The process 
yields, however, a mixture of several ceramic phases that 
differ from the starting materials. These phases, which 
include AlB2, Al4BC, AlB12C2, AlB12 and Al4C3, adversely affect 
some mechanical properties of the resultant composite. In 
addition, it is very difficult to produce composites having 
a density greater than 99% of theoretical by this process. 
This may be due, in part, to reaction kinetics that lead to 
formation of the ceramic phases and interfere with the 
rearrangement needed to attain adequate shrinkage or 
densification. It may also be due, at least in part, to a 
lack of control over reactivity of molten Al. In fact, 
most of the Al is depleted due to formation of the reaction 
products. US-A-4,702,770 discloses a method of making a B4C/Al 
composite. The method includes a preliminary step wherein 
particulate B4C is heated in the presence of free carbon at 
temperatures ranging from 1800°C to 2250°C to reduce the 
reactivity of B4C with molten Al. The reduced reactivity 
minimizes the undesirable ceramic phases formed by the 
process disclosed in US-A-4,605,440. During heat 
treatment, the B4C particles form a rigid network. The 
network, subsequent to infiltration by molten Al, 
substantially determines mechanical properties of the  
 
resultant composite. US-A-4,718,941 discloses a method of making metal-ceramic 
composites from ceramic precursor starting 
constituents. The constituents are chemically pretreated, 
formed into a porous precursor and then infiltrated with 
molten reactive metal. The chemical pretreatment alters 
the surface chemistry of the starting constituents and 
enhances infiltration by the molten metal. Ceramic 
precursor grains, such as B4C particles, that are held 
together by multiphase reaction products formed during 
infiltration form a rigid network that substantially 
determines mechanical properties of the resultant 
composite. One aspect of the present invention is a method for 
making a B4C/Al composite comprising sequential steps: 
a) heating a porous B4C preform to a temperature within 
a range of
