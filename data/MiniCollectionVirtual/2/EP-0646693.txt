<ABSTRACT>
The present invention provides a bottom hole assembly (BHA) for connection to a 
drillstring for use in directing the path of a drill bit while rotary drilling, the BHA 

comprising a drill bit arrangement (1), means (2) for providing a modified cutting 
action of the bit in a predetermined portion of the hole during rotation according to 

according to the rotary position of the bit in the hole, and a stabilizer (3), the BHA 
being characterised in that a flexible member (2) is interposed between the bit and 

said stabilizer. By "flexible" member is meant a member made from a material having 
a lower Young's modulus than steel and/or a member with a smaller wall thickness 

than the remainder of the BHA. In the case where the BHA is formed from steel pipe, 
a flexible member might be provided by an aluminium drill collar or a composite 

material drill collar. Alternatively or additionally, the wall thickness of the material 
from which the collar is formed can be made less than the remainder of the BHA.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a bottom hole assembly (BHA) for use in
directional rotary drilling.Current directional drilling practice is to drill the greatest portion of a deviated
well using rotary bottom hole assemblies. A rotary assembly is designed to increase
(build) or decrease (drop) the inclination in the vertical plane, and, to a lesser extent,
to turn to the right or the left in the horizontal plane. However, the degree to which
the rotary assembly will deviate cannot be accurately preset. Furthermore, even if a
slight change in the deviation trajectory becomes necessary while drilling, the BHA
needs to be pulled up to the surface and manually reconfigured. It is for these reasons
that in sections of a well where a reliable, accurate, or continuous change in the rate
of deviation is required, the rotary assembly is brought to the surface and a steerable
assembly is put in its place. A steerable assembly is one which includes a downhole
motor and a bent sub near to the bit. In such a case the BHA comprises a drill bit, a
bent sub which angles the bit axis at around  1 / 2
°-3° from the drillstring axis, and a
downhole motor connected to the bit. The new path of the borehole is achieved by
turning the drillstring until the bit is pointing in the desired direction due to the bent
sub. This position can be found by means of instruments located in the BHA, such as
accelerometers or magnetometers, which can determine the direction in which the bit
is facing and transmit the information to the surface. Once the bit is oriented in the
appropriate direction, it is rotated by means of the downhole motor, weight being
applied to the bit from the surface in the usual manner but without rotation of the
drillstring, and so is allowed to drill ahead in the desired direction. Once the trajectory
of the borehole has deviated to the required degree, the drillstring is pulled from the
well and the BHA replaced with a rotary BHA, and rotary drilling recommences to
drill straight ahead or deviate in the conventional manner.There are a number of problems when drilling with a BHA including a bent sub
and downhole motor. When drilling is conducted without rotation using the downhole
motor, the rate of penetration is greatly reduced. There is also a greater likelihood that
the drillstring will become stuck. Furthermore, use of a combination of rotary and
steerable tools often requires a greater number of trips of the drillstring out of the hole
to change or adjust BHA components; this combined with the slower
