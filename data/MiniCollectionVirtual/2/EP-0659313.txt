<ABSTRACT>
A frequency synthesizer (10) having a comb frequency generator (12), comb line selection filter (16), and phase locked loop (20) for filtering out spurious signal components and for offsetting the synthesizer output frequency from the frequency of a signal which is output by the comb line selection filter. A fine tuning signal source (38) is connected to the SSB mixer circuit (30) and provides a fine tuning signal to the SSB mixer to shift the VCO (26) output signal frequency by the amount of the frequency of the fine tuning signal, that amount being less than the frequency spacing of the comb spectrum signals.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a frequency synthesizer and, more 
particularly, to a synthesizer employing a comb or harmonic 
frequency generator with comb frequency line selection and 
a phase locked loop (PLL) for filtering out spurious signal 
components, the synthesizer having a single side band mixer 
within the PLL for offsetting the output frequency of the 
synthesizer from a comb frequency line. Synthesizers of high frequencies, in the gigahertz range by 
way of example, frequently employ a phase locked loop to 
stabilize the output signal frequency, and include also 
circuitry for down conversion in frequency of a sample of 
the output signal to enable use of lower frequency circuit 
components, such as those operating in the megahertz range, 
for phase locking the output signal to an input reference 
signal. Generally, it has been the practice to employ a 
frequency divider comprising one or more digital counters 
to accomplish the down conversion of frequency. In the operation of the frequency divider, the counters 
divide both the frequency and the phase of the sample of 
the output signal. This operation is satisfactory for many 
applications, but suffers from a limitation in that there 
may be excessive phase noise in the output signal for 
applications requiring a precision output signal. For 
example, in the case of a divider which divides the 
frequency and the phase by a factor of ten for presentation 
to a phase detector of the phase locked loop, a phase 
deviation at the low frequency end of the divider is one 
tenth that at the high frequency end of the divider.  
 Correspondingly, the phase noise power at the output signal is greater 
than the phase noise power at the input to the phase detector by a factor 
of 100 (20 decibels). It is desirable to employ a harmonic or comb frequency generator to 
obtain the desired output frequency of the synthesizer because the output 
frequency is then known accurately as an integral multiple of an input 
reference frequency. However, the use of the aforementioned down 
conversion with a comb spectrum may introduce aliasing with consequent 
difficulty in extraction of the desired signal frequency. Furthermore, it is 
generally necessary to provide the capability to offset an output frequency 
of the synthesizer from the frequency values of the comb frequency lines. Thus, there are problems in the construction of a frequency synthesizer 
employing a comb frequency generator and a frequency divider. In the 
case of the comb frequency generator, there
