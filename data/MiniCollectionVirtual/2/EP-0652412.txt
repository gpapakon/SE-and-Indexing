<ABSTRACT>
The load (3) is arranged to form a charge (4) in a thermic treatment space (2). Laterally adjacent to the thermic treatment space (2), essentially opposite one another, are an inflow duct (7) and an outflow duct (9). Arranged one behind the other in the direction of flow in the thermic treatment space, in front of the charge (4) in the direction of flow, are at least two rectifying plates (11) with passage openings (12). With the invention, it is intended to produce an industrial furnace, in which uniform temperature distribution inside the charge (4) is achieved in a constructionally simple manner.

<CLAIMS>
Industrial furnace for the heat treatment of material (4) which is arranged to
form a charge with spaces in between it (5) in a heat treatment chamber (2),

with a fan (6) which moves a stream of gas from an inlet channel (7) to an
outlet channel (9), wherein the inlet channel (7) and the outlet channel (9) are

substantially opposite each other and are on either side of the heat treatment
chamber (2) and wherein flow guide vanes (8) are provided in the inlet

channel (7)

characterised in that

at least two flow straighteners (11) provided with evenly distributed openings
(12) are arranged one behind the other in the direction of flow in the heat

treatment chamber (2) in the path of flow upstream of the charge (4).
Industrial furnace in accordance with claim 1

characterised in that

the flow straighteners (11 ) are arranged between the inlet channel (7) and the
heat treatment chamber 
(2).
Industrial furnace according to claim 1 or 2

characterised in that

the flow straighteners (11) are arranged at a distance to each other which is
large enough to ensure that the stream of gas can even out after passing

through each flow straightener (11).
Industrial furnace according to any one of claims 1 through 3

characterised in that

the size of the holes in each flow straightener (11) increases in the direction
of flow.
Industrial furnace according to any one of claims 1 through 4

characterised in that

at least one flow straightener (11') is arranged in the outlet channel (9).
Industrial furnace according to claim 5

characterised in that

the size of the hole in the flow straightener (11') changes such that the hole
size increases from the main flow area to the low flow areas.
