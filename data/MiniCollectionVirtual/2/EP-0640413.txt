<ABSTRACT>
To achieve satisfactory surface finish while keeping the energy content of the rolling stock high in a rolling arrangement (9) with a rolling stand (10) and a descaling device (11) arranged ahead of it, the descaling device (11) is arranged immediately in front of the rolls (14) of the rolling stand (10), the descaling device (11) is formed by a rotor-type descaling device, the liquid jets (21) emerging from the rotor-type descaling device and striking the rolling stock (4) being directed counter to the direction of rolling (26), and after impact, the liquid striking the surface (24) of the rolling stock at the point of impact (25) of the liquid jet (21) has a flow resultant which - projected onto the direction of rolling (26) - has a component opposite to the direction of rolling (26) (Fig. 2).

<CLAIMS>
A rolling arrangement (9) comprising a rolling stand (10) and a preceding descaling 
means (11), characterized in that 


the descaling means (11) comprises a rotor descaling means arranged immediately in 
front of the rolls (14) of the rolling stand (10), 
wherein the liquid jets (21) emerging from the rotor descaling means and impinging on 
the rolling stock (4) are directed opposite to the rolling direction (26). 
A rolling arrangement according to claim 1, characterized in that the planes laid 
through the axis (22) of the liquid jets (21) and parallel to an axis (18) of one of the rolls 

(14) of the rolling stand (10) always enclose an acute angle with the rolling direction (26) 
laid on the surface (24) of the rolling stock (4) at the point of impact (25) of the liquid jet 

(21), the vertex of which angle is directed opposite to the rolling direction (26). 
A rolling arrangement according to claim 1 or 2, characterized in that the rotor 
axis(es) (23) of the rotor descaling means (11) is/are arranged in a manner inclined relative 

to the surface (24) of the rolling stock (4) (Figs. 1, 2). 
A rolling arrangement according to claim 3, characterized in that the angle of 
inclination (β) of th
e rotor axis (23) relative to a straight line oriented perpendicular to the 
surface (24) of the rolling stock (4) is larger than the angle (α) enclosed by the axis (22) of 

a liquid jet (21) with the rotor axis (23). 
A rolling arrangement according to one of claims 1 to 4, characterized in that a 
partial region (32) of the spraying region (33) produced by the liquid jets (21) of the rotor 

descaling means (11) is shielded off relative to the surface (24) of the rolling stock (4) 
(Figs. 3, 4).  

 
A rolling arrangement according to claim 5, characterized in that for shielding off 
said partial region (32) there is provided a cover sheet (34) including a liquid draining 

channel (35) and extending across the surface (24) of the rolling stock (4). 
A rolling arrangement according to claim 5 or 6, characterized in that the cover 
sheet (34), viewed in ground section, covers a spraying region (32) directed against the 

rolling gap (30) of the rolling stand (10). 
A rolling arrangement according to claim 7, characterized in that the cover sheet 
(34) is provided with a rolling stock capturing or guiding means (34') directed opposite to 

the rolling direction, for safely introducing the front end of the rolling stock into the rolling 
gap (30). 
A rolling arrangement according to claim 8, characterized in that the capturing and 
guiding means (34') is comprised of a plate panel (34') extending parallel to one of the axes 

(18) of the rolls (14) of the rolling stand (10) and in which at least one recess (36) is 
provided for the passage of the liquid jets (21) emerging from the rotor descaling means 

(11). 
A rolling arrangement according to claim 9, characterized in that the recess (36) is 
designed in the form of an annulus section. 
A rolling arrangement according to one of claims 1 to 10, characterized in that the 
rolling stand (10) is adapted for the rolling of a cast strand (4), in particular of a thin strand. 
A rolling arrangement according to claim 11, characterized in that the rolling stand 
(10) is integrated with a continuous casting plant.  

 
A rolling arrangement according to one of claims 1 to 12, characterized in that the 
rotor descaling means (11) is disposed within the rolling housing (16) of the rolling stand 

(10). 
A rolling arrangement according to one of claims 1 to 13, characterized in that the 
rotor descaling means (11) comprises two or several rotor heads (17) adjacently arranged 

approximately parallel to the axes (18) of the rolls (14) of the rolling stand (10). 
A rolling arrangement according to one of claims 1 to 14, characterized in that a 
cross spraying means (31) is provided in the immediate region of entry of the rolls (14) of
