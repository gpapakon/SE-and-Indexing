<ABSTRACT>
A recording medium transfer mechanism in which a
transfer roller is press-contacted against a travel portion

of a pushing-out lever. When a disk is inserted, the
transfer roller rotates counterclockwise, and travels on the

travel portion of the pushing-out lever, so that a transfer
means swings towards an X1 side to position Y. On the other

hand, when the disk is removed, the transfer roller rotates
clockwise, causing the transfer means to swing towards an X2

side, approach a recording medium driving portion, and swing
to position X, thereby ensuring clamping of the disk. In

other words, the transfer means can approach or move away
from the disk in accordance with the direction of rotation

of the transfer roller, thereby eliminating the need for a
special member. Therefore, the number of component parts

required is reduced, and space, for such a special member,
is not required.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a recording medium
transfer mechanism for inserting a recording medium into and
removing a recording medium from a device. Examples of
recording media include disks, such as a compact disk (CD)
or a digital video disk (DVD), and other types of recording
media.Fig. 10A is a side view of a conventional disk device,
in which a recording medium is being transferred, and Fig.
10B is a side view of a conventional disk device, in which
transfer of a recording medium has been completed.A disk drive portion A and a disk transfer means B are
provided in the disk device 21 of Fig. 10. The recording
medium for use in the disk device 21 may be a disk, such as
a CD or a DVD.In the disk drive portion A, a rotary motor 23 is
fixedly provided at a drive chassis 22, and a turntable 24
is rotatably supported by a rotary shaft of the rotary motor
23. A raised portion 22a is formed at the left end (X2)
side of the drive chassis 22, by bending the left end (X2) 
side portion of the drive chassis 22. A clamp member 26 is
rotatably supported at one end thereof by a rotary shaft 25
provided at the raised portion 22a. A clamper 27 is
rotatably provided at the end of the clamper member 26 which
is opposite to the end rotatably supported by the rotary
shaft 25. Rotation of the clamp member 26 in the direction
of arrow β2 allows chucking between the clamper 27 and the
turntable 24.In the disk transfer means B, a drive roller 29 is
rotatably supported by a transfer member 28, and is rotated
in the forward or backward direction by a drive motor (not
shown). The transfer member 28 has a supporting arm 28a
that is formed by bending a portion of the transfer member
28, with a rotary shaft 28b being provided at one end of the
supporting arm 28a. The rotary shaft 28b is supported by,
for example, a portion of a housing (not shown) so as to be
swingable in the directions indicated by γ1 and γ2. A disk
guide member 31 is provided above, or at the Z1 side of, the
transfer member 28. A biasing member 30, such as a coil
spring, is provided at the transfer member 28 in order to
bias the drive roller 29 in the Z1 direction. When the
transfer member 28 rotates in the γ1 direction by means of
the biasing member 30, the drive roller 29 press-contacts
the disk guide member 31.As shown in Fig. 10A, a disk D is placed into or 
removed from a disk insertion opening 33 at the front face
of the disk device 21 (or at the right end or X1 side of the
disk device 21 in Fig. 10A). When the disk D is being
inserted into or

<CLAIMS>
A recording medium transfer mechanism, comprising:

an opening (3a) for inserting therein and removing
therefrom a recording medium;
a recording medium driving portion (9, 10) for driving
the recording medium; and
a transfer roller (R) disposed between said opening
and said recording medium driving portion;

   
characterised in that
, when the recording medium is
inserted into said opening, said transfer roller, while

rotating in a direction in which the recording medium is
sent to said recording medium driving portion, moves away

from said recording medium driving portion; and

   wherein when the recording medium is discharged, said
transfer roller rotates and moves in a direction opposite

to the direction in which said transfer roller rotates and
moves when the recording medium is inserted into said

opening.
A recording medium transfer mechanism according to
Claim 1, wherein said transfer roller (R) has a shaft which

is movably supported between said opening and said
recording medium driving portion; wherein as a result of a 

rotational reaction force produced when said transfer
roller sends the recording medium towards said recording

medium driving portion (9, 10), said transfer roller moves
away from said recording medium driving portion; and

wherein when the recording medium has been sent to said
recording medium driving portion, said transfer roller

moves away from the recording medium.
A recording medium transfer mechanism according to
Claim 1, wherein said transfer roller (R) has a shaft which

is movably supported between said opening (3a) and said
recording medium driving portion (9, 10); and wherein when

said transfer roller starts to move in a direction in which
the recording medium is removed, said transfer roller rolls

on a travel portion (14b) provided in a device and
approaches said recording medium driving portion in order

to reach a location where said transfer roller is capable
of exerting a removing force onto the recording medium at

said recording medium driving portion.
A recording medium transfer mechanism according to
Claim 1, further comprising pushing-out means (14) for

pushing the recording medium at said recording medium 
driving portion towards said transfer roller (R); wherein

when said transfer roller moves towards said recording
medium driving portion, said pushing-out means operates to

push the recording medium towards said transfer roller.
A recording medium transfer mechanism according to
Claim 4, wherein said pushing-out means has an integrally

formed travel portion (14b) which is used for clamping the
recording medium between said travel portion and said

transfer roller or which comes into contact with said
transfer roller; wherein by a rotational force produced

when said transfer roller rotates in the direction in which
the recording medium is inserted, said pushing means moves

towards the back side of the device; and wherein by a
rotational force produced when said transfer roller rotates

in a direction in which the recording medium is removed,
said pushing-out means mores towards said transfer roller.
