<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to use of a mixture of 
cyan, yellow and magenta dyes in a black laser dye-ablative 
recording element. In recent years, thermal transfer systems 
have been developed to obtain prints from pictures 
which have been generated electronically from a color 
video camera. According to one way of obtaining such 
prints, an electronic picture is first subjected to 
color separation by color filters. The respective 
color-separated images are then converted into 
electrical signals. These signals are then operated on 
to produce cyan, magenta and yellow electrical signals. 
These signals are then transmitted to a thermal 
printer. To obtain the print, a cyan, magenta or 
yellow dye-donor element is placed face-to-face with a 
dye-receiving element. The two are then inserted 
between a thermal printing head and a platen roller. A 
line-type thermal printing head is used to apply heat 
from the back of the dye-donor sheet. The thermal 
printing head has many heating elements and is heated 
up sequentially in response to the cyan, magenta and 
yellow signals. The process is then repeated for the 
other two colors. A color hard copy is thus obtained 
which corresponds to the original picture viewed on a 
screen. Further details of this process and an 
apparatus for carrying it out are contained in U.S. 
Patent No. 4,621,271. Another way to thermally obtain a print using 
the electronic signals described above is to use a 
laser instead of a thermal printing head. In such a 
system, the donor sheet includes a material which 
strongly absorbs at the wavelength of the laser. When 
the donor is irradiated, this absorbing material 
converts light energy to thermal energy and transfers 
the heat to the dye in the immediate vicinity, thereby  
 
heating the dye to its vaporization temperature for 
transfer to the receiver. The absorbing material may 
be present in a layer beneath the dye and/or it may be 
admixed with the dye. The laser beam is modulated by 
electronic signals which are representative of the 
shape and color of the original image, so that each dye 
is heated to cause volatilization only in those areas 
in which its presence is required on the receiver to 
reconstruct the color of the original object. Further 
details of this process are found in GB 2,083,726A. In one ablative mode of imaging by the action 
of a laser beam, an element with a dye layer 
composition comprising an image dye, an infrared-absorbing 
material, and a binder coated onto a 
substrate is imaged from the dye
