<CLAIMS>
An external rear-view mirror for vehicles, preferably for motor vehicles, with a housing
(2) in which a glass-support plate (3) is pivotable by means of an actuating lever (11)

about two axes at a right angle to each other, the actuating lever (11) being connected in
an articulated manner to an intermediate lever (15) which is connected in an articulated

manner by way of two rods (24, 25; 24a, 25a; 24b, 25b) to the glass-support plate (3)
which is mounted on a joint (5) at a distance from the articulation point of the rods (24,

25; 24a, 25a; 24b, 25b) comprising at one end thereof a bearing shell (29, 30; 29a, 30a)
by which they are each mounted on a respective ball bearing (27, 28), 
characterized in
that
 the intermediate lever (15) is a two-armed lever provided with a transverse member
(26) which extends transversely thereto and at the ends of which the ball bearings (27,

28) are provided.
An external rear-view mirror according to Claim 1, 
characterized in that
 the transverse
member (26) is provided at the free end of the intermediate lever (15) which is preferably

mounted on a ball-and-socket joint.
An external rear-view mirror according to Claim 1 or 2, 
characterized in that
 the rods
(24, 25) are provided at the other end thereof with a further bearing shell (35, 36) by

which they are each mounted on a respective ball bearing (31, 32) associated with the
glass-support plate (3).
An external rear-view mirror according to one of Claims 1 to 3, 
characterized in that

the rods (24, 25; 24a, 25a; 24b, 25b) are formed integrally at least with the bearing shells
(29, 30; 29a, 30a) on the intermediate lever.
An external rear-view mirror, in particular according to one of Claims 1 to 4, 
characterized
in that
 the rods (24a, 25a; 24b, 25b) are each attached to the glass-support plate (3)
by a respective resilient web (46, 48) situated preferably at a right angle to the glass-support

plate.
An external rear-view mirror according to Claim 5, 
characterized in that
 the rods (24a,
25a; 24b, 25b) have a further resilient web (45, 47) which is likewise situated preferably

at a right angle to the glass-support plate (3) and which is situated at a right angle to the
other resilient web (46, 48), and the resilient webs (46, 48) facing the glass-support plate 

(3) are preferably situated in a vertical plane and the further resilient webs (45, 47) are
preferably situated in a horizontal plane.
An external rear-view mirror according to Claim 5 or 6, 
characterized in that
 the two
resilient webs (45 to 48) of each rod (24a, 25a; 24b, 25b) are separated from each other

by an intermediate member (50, 51) which is preferably situated at a right angle to the
two resilient webs (45 to 48) of each rod (24a, 25a; 24b, 25b).
An external rear-view mirror according to Claim 7, 
characterized in that
 the intermediate
member (50, 51) is formed in a web-shaped and/or rigid manner.
An external rear-view mirror according to one of Claims 5 to 8, 
characterized in that

the two resilient webs (45 to 48) of each rod (24a, 25a; 24b, 25b) are resiliently flexible
in directions at right angles to one another.

characterized
in that
 the joint (54) for the glass-support plate (3) preferably comprises web-shaped
spring parts (56 to 59) which are resiliently flexible in directions at right angles to

one another and which are preferably arranged in planes situated at right angles to one
another.
An external rear-view mirror according to Claim 10, 
characterized in that
