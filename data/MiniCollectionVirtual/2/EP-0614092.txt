<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a radar apparatus provided with a 
phased array antenna for pulsed radar transmissions. 

According to the invention, the phased array antenna can 
also be used for quasi-CW illumination of a number of 

targets. To this end, it is optional to reduce the supply 
voltage (12) of the transmitter-output amplifier (7), to 

reduce the bias voltage of the FET amplifier elements in 
the transmitter-output amplifier (7) or to use a 

dynamically varying thinned array.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a radar apparatus provided with an
active phased array antenna having N modules, for
generating pulsed radar transmissions in a first operating
mode and for generating CW transmissions in a second
operating mode.In the first operating mode the radar apparatus may be used
for regular radar transmissions, for producing a radar
picture of the surroundings of for example a ship on which
the radar apparatus is placed. In the second operating mode
the radar apparatus may be used for illuminating one or
more targets, for example for guiding semi-active missiles
towards those targets, or for electronic countermeasures
modes.A radar apparatus of this type is known from US-A
5.155.492. In this known apparatus the dissipation of the
modules is limited in the second operating mode solely by reducing
the supply voltages and currents of the power amplifiers of
the modules. A disadvantage of this known apparatus is that
this inevitably results in rather specialized modules, with provisions
for controlling the bias of the transistors used.The advantage of the radar apparatus according to the
invention is that standardized modules may be used as long
as there is a provision, per module to switch the module on
or off. The radar according to the invention is therefore
characterized in that in the second operating mode only M
out of N antenna modules are active, with M<N, that the N
active modules are selected in a pseudo random way, that
the pseudo-random selection is periodically changed such
that for each antenna module a specified duty cycle in not 
exceeded and that an average radiated power in both
operating modes is at least substantially the same.The invention is based on the principle of thinned arrays,
as for instance described in M.I. Skolnik's "Radar
Handbook", second edition, page 7.26. The prevailing
consideration here is that if only a limited number of
antenna modules is active and this number of modules is
distributed over the radiating antenna surface in a pseudo-random
way, a beam is obtained with substantially
unmodified parameters.A favourable operation is effected if a new pseudo-random
selection is made by each time activating only one antenna
module and simultaneously deactivating an other antenna
module.The invention will now be described with reference to the
following figures, of which

array antenna;Fig. 2schematically represents an antenna module provided
