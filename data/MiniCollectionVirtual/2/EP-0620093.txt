<ABSTRACT>
A deburring and cleaning apparatus which can 
remove burr on a plastic card automatically and rapidly 

with a simple mechanism and further remove foreign 
articles on a surface of the plastic card as well as 

static electricity of the plastic card is disclosed. 
The deburring and cleaning apparatus comprises a pair of 

deburring pressure rollers (11, 12) for holding and 
transporting a plastic card therebetween, a motor (9) 

for driving the pressure rollers (11, 12) to rotate, and 
a heater (13) for heating the pressure rollers (11, 12) 

and the plastic card to melt burr of the plastic card. 
A pair of adhesive rollers (21, 22) and a discharge 

brush (23) are located in this order on the downstream 
side of the pressure rollers (11, 12) in a transporting 

direction in which the plastic card is transported.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a deburring and 
cleaning apparatus for removing burr produced on edges 
of a flattened plastic article such as a plastic card or 
a plastic sheet when it is cut in a predetermined size 
or dust or like foreign articles sticking to surfaces of 
a plastic card or the like.  
 From DE-A-38 20 975 there is known a method to deburr a plastic 
sheet comprising heating the sheet and melting the burrs. An 
apparatus to perform this method may comprise at least a heater 
to heat the plastic article, for which a single heated deburring 
roller may be applied.  
 Plastic cards used for various applications such 
as member's card and ID (identification) cards have a 
greater thickness and a higher rigidity than prepaid 
cards such as telephone cards and are liable to form 
burrs on edges thereof when they are cut in 
a predetermined size. As an example for use of cut plastic articles 
a table-top card printer which can 
print in full colors on a surface of a plastic card of a 
comparatively great thickness cut in a predetermined 
size has been developed and put on the market by a 
company which is an assignee of the present invention.  
 
The card printer is constructed such that a plastic card 
is electrostatically attracted to a flat attraction 
table, and a color ink film is pressed strongly against 
the surface of the plastic card by means of a thermal 
head while the thermal head and the plastic card are 
moved relative to each other to print on the surface of 
the plastic card. In the card printer just described, if burr 
remains on edges of the plastic card, the burr is 
removed from the plastic card and electrostatically 
attracted to the attraction table, and as the number of 
printed plastic cards increases, such burr is gradually 
accumulated on the attraction table and reduces the 
attracting force of the attraction table for a plastic 
card. As such reduction of the attracting force 
proceeds, it finally becomes impossible to fixedly hold 
a plastic card on the attraction table. As a result, 
when it is tried to press the thermal head strongly 
against the surface of a plastic card with a color ink 
film interposed therebetween while moving the thermal 
head and the plastic card relative to each other to 
print on the surface of the plastic card, the plastic 
card is spaced away from the attraction table, resulting 
in failure to print.  
 If deburring of such plastic cards 
is conventionally performed all by 
manual operation one by one and edge by edge this is a 
very
