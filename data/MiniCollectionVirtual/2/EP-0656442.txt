<ABSTRACT>
Packaging material comprising wet-strengthened paper is 
disclosed in which at least a part of the wet-strengthened 

paper is coated with a rubber-based adhesive. The adhesive 
comprises a substance which secures it to the wet-strengthened 

paper such that, on repulping, the wet 
strengthened paper forms particles which are large in 

comparison to recyclable fibres which would be formed by a 
fibrous recyclable substance with the adhesive remaining 

secured to the large particles.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to packaging material
and, in particular, to paper-based packaging material.Packaging materials having adhesive-coated
regions which render them self-sealing are, of course,
well-known. Examples of such materials include self-sealing
envelopes and self-sealing corrugated wrapping
paper which may be used, for example, for packaging
books or magazines. The adhesives which are used in
such materials are generally rubber-based and have the
useful property that when applied to the material they
form a secure bond with other adhesive-coated areas of
the material but substantially no bond to other
substrates. This property means that the adhesive
coated region requires no protection and allows an
article to be wrapped in a fully coated adhesive sheet
of the packaging material without damage to the
surface of the article.The packaging materials of the type described
above are, generally, paper-based and, as such, are
recyclable. However, the adhesive which is present in
the materials can cause problems when they are
included in the raw material stream of a conventional
waste-paper mill producing paper or board from mixed
or unsorted waste. When the materials are repulped,
the rubber-based (typically latex) coating is
separated from the fibre as soft, elastic particles
that readily pass through the screens (filters) used
to separate the useful recovered fibre from the
unwanted undispersed material. Passage of the elastic
particles through the screens with the fibre can cause
problems such as blocked paper machine wires, visual
defects, sticky particles causing adhesion to the
drying rollers (and hence tears, holes or web breaks), 
adhesion in the rewound paper and various problems in the final use
of the paper or board. Such particles are known in the art as
"stickies".It is an object of the present invention to provide packaging
material with an adhesive coating which reduces or eliminates the
problems associated with "stickies" and which is, therefore, readily
recyclable. This object has been attained by ensuring that the
adhesive remains associated with relatively large particles in the
repulped mixture and, therefore, that it is separable from the useful
recyclable fibres in the recycling process.FR-A-2207966 describes cohesive coating compositions for
application to sheet materials, which comprise 51 to 99% of a
natural or synthetic rubber, 1 to 49% of a polyalkyl methacrylate and
5 to 35% of an inert particulate material having a mean particle size
in the range of 0.2 to 50 microns.

<CLAIMS>
Packaging material comprising a corrugated sheet of wet-strengthened
paper, at least a part of said sheet being coated with a

rubber-based adhesive, the adhesive-coated paper forming an
adhesive bond with other adhesive-coated areas of the paper but

substantially no bond to other substrates, wherein the adhesive
comprises a polymer compatible with the rubber, the polymer being

selected from (i) polymers and copolymers of styrene, butadiene,
isoprene, alkyl acrylates, alkyl methacrylates and ethylene; (ii)

polyolefins; and (iii) rosin esters, which secures the adhesive to the
wet-strengthened paper such that on repulping the adhesive remains

secured to particles formed from the wet-stengthened paper in the
repulped mixture which particles are larger than, and are separable

from, useful recyclable fibres.
Material as claimed in claim 1, wherein the rubber-based
adhesive is applied to the paper as a latex.
Material as claimed in claim 1 or claim 2, wherein the adhesive
is based on natural rubber.
Material as claimed in any one of claims 1 to 3, wherein the
polymer is a styrene-butadiene copolymer, a polyacrylate or a

polymethacrylate.
Material as claimed in any one of claims 1 to 4, wherein the
substance comprises 5 to 50% by weight of the adhesive.
Material as claimed in any one of claims 1 to 5, wherein the
sheet has an adhesive coating on one side and the other side is

adhered to a backing substrate.
Material as claimed in claim 6, wherein the backing substrate
is kraft paper.
