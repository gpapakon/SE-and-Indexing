<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a novel substituted
fluorine-containing β-indolebutyric acid compound having a
physiologically active capacity for markedly elongating
plant roots, a plant growth regulating agent containing
the substituted fluorine-containing β-indolebutyric acid
compound as an active component thereof, and a method for
regulating the length of roots sprouting from plant seeds
and the length of hypocotyls by the action of the
compound.It has long been known that indole-3-acetic acid
(hereinafter referred to as "IAA") and derivatives thereof
such as, for example, methyl indole-3-acetate and indole-3-acetamide,
accelerate the growth of plants. It is also
known that 4,7-dichloroindole-3-acetic acid and 5,7-dichloroindole-3-acetic
acid manifest an anti-auxin action
["Planta," Vol. 140, page 89 (1978)].It has been recently ascertained that 4,4,4-trifluoro-3-(indole-3-)butyric
acid (hereinafter referred
to as "TFIBA"), 4,4,4-trifluoro-2-hydroxy-3-(indole-3-)butyric
acid ("TFIHBA"), and 4,4,4-trifluoro-3-(indole-3-)butyronitrile
("TFIBN"), which are fluorine-containing
β-indolebutyric acid compounds, manifest a strong activity
in accelerating the growth of plant roots (Collection of
monographs for publication at the 1990 general meeting of
Plant Chemical Regulation Society, page 31, published by 
Plant Chemical Regulation Society). In Japanese Patent
Public Disclosure Hei 5(1993)-279331, some of the present
inventors have disclosed fluorine-containing indolebutyric
acid compounds which manifest a similar effect.In the recent years, increasing the yield of
plants which are useful as food has become an important
task in view of the growth of the world's population. The
acceleration of the elongation of plant roots is one of
the factor necessary for increasing plant yield. Plant
growth regulating agents containing such compounds as IAA
and exhibiting anti-auxin activity and other conventional
plant growth regulating agents are, however, not
sufficiently active in elongating plant roots. The TFIBA,
TFIHBA, and TFIBN mentioned above are fluorine-containing
β-indolebutyric acid compounds that exhibit fairly strong
plant root elongation activity, as compared with IAA and
the derivatives thereof. Nevertheless, their activity is
not fully satisfactory for practical use. A need exists
for developing a substance capable of exhibiting even
stronger plant root elongation activity.This invention was accomplished in light of the
foregoing circumstances. It is, therefore, an object of
this invention to provide a
