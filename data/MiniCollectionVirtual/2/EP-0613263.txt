<ABSTRACT>
An optical communication network includes a novel, passive optical 

component. This component combines the function of a splitter with the function of 
a wavelength-division multiplexer. These functions are performed in distinct 

wavelength bands. In one embodiment, the inventive component is made using 
silicon optical bench technology.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to fiber-optic communication networks, and more
particularly to those networks that include passive components for routing and
distributing optical transmissions.Optical fiber networks are increasingly important for the distribution of
telephonic signals. Such systems generally involve a plurality of feeder fibers that
emanate from a central office and terminate at respective remote terminals. Optical
signals are transmitted over distribution fibers between each of these remote
terminals and a plurality of optical network units (ONUs). Signals are transmitted
optically or electrically between each ONU and, typically, 4 - 12 customer premises.Several network architectures have been proposed for transmitting
signals between the remote terminals and the ONUs. One such architecture is the
passive optical network (PON). In a PON, passive components are used to exchange
signals between the feeder and distribution fibers. For example, a 1 × N broadcast
coupler or a 1 × N wavelength-division multiplexer (WDM) is typically used to
distribute an outbound signal from one feeder fiber into many (N is typically 16)
distribution fibers.For simplicity, the descriptions of PONs included herein will often
assume that signal transmission is bidirectional along each of the optical fibers of the
PON. However, these discussions are meant to include unidirectional PONs as well.
Bidirectional communication is readily achieved by operating an outbound,
unidirectional PON in conjunction with an inbound, also unidirectional PON.Some proposed PON networks will carry both narrowband telephonic
transmissions, and also broadband transmissions (such as cable television or high-definition
television transmissions). However, distribution losses in a broadcast
splitter (such as coupler 10 of FIG. 1) which are tolerable for narrowband
transmission may, nevertheless, result in inadequate signal levels for reception in
(generally less sensitive) broadband receivers. Depicted in FIG. 1 is a PON
configuration in which broadcast signals (which will typically be narrowband
signals) are distributed by N x N coupler 10. Additionally, signals in specified
signal channels (distinguished by wavelength) are bypassed around coupler 10 and
delivered to specific ONUs. (These signals are typically broadband signals.) This 
configuration minimizes distribution losses in the broadband signals.The PON configuration of FIG. 1 is described in
EP-A-0546707.Briefly, the bypass arrangement is based on
coarse, upstream WDM 20, plural coarse
