<ABSTRACT>
Apparatus and methods for aligning a powder spray canopy of a powder coating 
booth (12) with a fan plenum assembly (38) so that a powder collector can 

be quickly aligned and effectively sealed to both the powder spray canopy 

(14) and the fan plenum (38). The invention also relates to an improved 
filter cartridge (120) mounting assembly which allows for quick and easy 

mounting and dismounting of filter cartridges in the powder collector.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to powder coating booths
and collection systems for electrostatic application of
powder coating materials, and particularly to an apparatus
for aligning a powder spray canopy with a fan plenum so
that a powder collector can be aligned and sealed to both
the powder spray canopy and the fan plenum.Powder booths for electrostatic application of
powder materials to articles typically include a spray
booth and a conveyor for carrying the article to be
sprayed through the spray booth. Spray guns mounted in
the booth and connected to a source of air entrained
powder, such as a powder feed hopper and powder pump,
spray electrostatically charged powder material onto the
electrically grounded article carried by the conveyor
through the booth. An important feature of the powder
booths is the apparatus for collecting oversprayed powder,
that is the powder which does not adhere to the 
articles being powder coated, and returning this powder
to the spray guns. Typically, an exhaust system
including a fan plenum assembly creates a negative
pressure in the booth and causes oversprayed powder to be
drawn into the powder collector where the air is
separated from the powder prior to exhausting the cleaned
air to atmosphere. The oversprayed powder is typically
collected at the bottom of the powder collector where it
is recirculated to the powder feed hopper for return to
the spray guns.When the air carries the loose powder from within
the spray booth into the powder collector, some of the
powder falls and collects at the bottom of the collector
while the remainder collects on the outside of the one or
more filters. This latter powder can be removed by
techniques including air pulsing, as discussed in U.S.
Patent No. 4,662,309, assigned to Nordson Corp., the
assignee of the present invention,Typically, interchangeable powder collectors are
moved into or out of position under or adjacent the spray
booth to enable the use of a different powder collector
for each color powder being sprayed. The powder
collectors have an inlet opening adapted to be aligned
with and securely sealed against a powder exhaust opening
in the canopy of the spray booth. An airtight seal is
important to prevent the escape of spray powder to the
surrounding atmosphere. Further, the powder collectors
have an air outlet adapted to be aligned with and sealed
against the air inlet opening of an exhaust plenum
assembly. The integrity of this seal is also very 
important to insure that the negative pressure developed
by the exhaust fan
