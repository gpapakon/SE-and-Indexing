<ABSTRACT>
Apparatus for purifying confined liquids and slurries by means of a spark discharge wherein the inner surface (24) of a treatment vessel (20) is designed to include a reflector section (21) adjacent to a pair of electrodes (28) and a concentrating section (22) intensifying the shock wave generated by the discharge between the electrodes (28). An external power supply (11) is coupled through a pulse forming network (14) to the electrodes (28). The network (14) is impedance matched to the impedance of the plasma arc generated between the electrodes (28) to provide a high power pulse to the electrodes (28). The establishment of the plasma produces an extremely high pressure shock wave of u.v. radiation fringing on X ray and electrohydraulic pressurization to alter the characteristics of liquid in the vessel (20).

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to apparatus for treating liquids and slurries by the use
of a pulsed spark discharge between electrodes in a treatment vessel and, more
particularly, to the purification of domestics, agricultural and industrial waters;
sewage waste waters; industrial, chemical food processing and other toxic waste
products; and the separation of dissolved sales and minerals, metals and other
elements from liquids and slurries.The increasing awareness of the need to treat liquid-like substances such as
sewage, chemical and food-processing waste and other toxic waste products prior to
their release into the surrounding environment has created a strong present interest
in effective methods and apparatus for efficiently carrying out a purification process.
One process described in U.S. Patent No. 4,458,153 utilized the effects of a spark
discharge produced between electrodes in combination with a localized magnetic field
to alter the characteristics of confined liquid substances. Other investigations have
resulted in limited volumes of liquid-waste being treated in a small confinement
chamber, typically one liter or less, in which a spark discharge is established for a
brief period. In this apparatus, a pair of electrodes are provided in the chamber with
the pulsed energy from an external power source applied therebetween. The
investigations have demonstrated that increased radiated power, shock waves and
pressures in the vessel can be used to destroy micro-organisms in the liquid and
effect purification thereof.Results from spark discharge studies have been obtained using laboratory-size
vessels to provide batch purification processing of small quantities of liquid waste.
Primarily because of the energy requirements, the limited capacity of the treatment
vessel and the use of batch treatment techniques, the spark discharge treatment
method has not been commercially developed. Due consideration has not been given
to the overall design of the confinement chamber so as to render it capable of use
on a continuing basis for relatively large quantities of liquid waste. Furthermore, the
energy consumption of known systems using a small confinement vessel is relatively
large per unit of treated material. This characteristic is due in part to the lack of
efficiency in the transfer of energy from the power source to the region between the
exposed ends of the electrodes within the chamber. Attempts to treat large volumes of fluid in a continuously
operating process suffered important drawbacks such as rapid
