<ABSTRACT>
In conjunction with an arrangement for separating out coarse matter and/or bulky materials in rainwater relief works, which arrangement comprises a dirt separator which is arranged in the region of the relief threshold and is made up of bar elements which are arranged preferably at equidistant spacings from one another, it is proposed to arrange the bar elements (21) on the overflow side of the release threshold (10) and further to provide there a separate dirt channel (22) which receives the coarse matter retained by the dirt separator (20).

<CLAIMS>
An arrangement for the separation of coarse matter 
and/or bulky solids in rainwater relief structures, 

comprising: an interceptor arranged in the area of 
a relief weir , and 

a separate pollutant channel which receives the 
coarse matter retained by the interceptor
 
characterized in
 
that preferably equidistantly spaced bar elements (21) 

being arranged on an overflow side of said relief 
weir (10) and are fixed on an edge of said relief 

weir (10) and on the top edge of a partition (24) 
whereby the partition (24) separates the pollutant 

channel (22) and is lower than said relief weir (10) 
said bar elements. 
The arrangement according to claim 1
 
characterized in
 
that a flushing trough (23) is positioned at at 

least one end of said relief weir (10) and is situated 
lower than a crown of said relief weir (10) and is 

open toward the pollutant channel (22). 
The arrangement according to claim 1 or 2
 
characterized in
 
that the pollutant channel (22) is functionally 

connected with a feeder leading to a treatment 
system (5) for coarse matter. 
The arrangement according to one of the claims 1 to 3
 
characterized in
 
that in case said rain relief structure is circular 

the arrangement comprises: 

a sedimentation weir disposed between an inlet 
and a sedimentation plant channel, said sedimentation 

weir being lower than saidrelief weir;  
 
said relief weir being disposed between said 
inlet and an arcuate channel leading to a body 

of receiving water; 
said sedimentation plant channel and said body 
of receiving water channel being mutually 

separated; 
said pollutant channel (22) is disposed coaxially 
to the body of receiving wat
er channel (6);
 
and 
said bar elements (21) extending from the 
relief weir (10) and flaring conically outwardly 

and downwardly. 
The arrangement according to one of the claims 1 
to 4
 
characterized in
 
that said bar elements (21) are fashioned as 

narrow strips. 
The arrangement according to claim 5
 
characterized in
 
that the narrow strips, viewed transverse to the 

overflow direction, are fashioned conically in 
such a way that the wider end abuts a partition (24) 

disposed radially of said relief weir. 
The arrangement according to claim 5 or 6
 
characterized in that
 
the bar elements (21) have on their top side a fillet. 
A rain basin for sewage systems with an overflow 
for clarified water, where the overflow is 

arranged at a rim of the basin and is formed by 
a clear water drain with an overflow weir and a 

clear water line, where at the transition from the 
basin to the clear water drain there is an 

interceptor provided for retention of coarse matter,  
 

and where said clear water drain (110) comprises:
 
a channel (114) covered by means of the interceptor 

(116) which functionally is tied to the clear 
water line (112) , and a pollutant channel (115) 

which removes coarse matter retained by the 
interceptor (116)
 
characterized in
 
that the clear water channel (114) and the pollutant 

channel (115) being mutually separated by a 
partition (117) which is lower than the overflow 

and that the interceptor (116) is formed by a 
plurality of equidistantly arranged bar elements, 

which are fixed at the top edge of the overflow (111) 
and at the top edge of the partition (11). 
The rain basis according to claim 8
 
characterized in that
 
the bar elements are tins with a curved top edge. 
The rain basin according to claim 8 or 9
 
characterized in that
 
the spacing between the bar elements amounts to 

about 4 mm. 
The rain basin according one of the claims 8 to 10
 
characterized in that
 
the pollutant channel (115) is functionally tied 

to a drain pipe (118) for the coarse matter, said 
drain pipe (118) is arranged radially on the basin. 
The rain basin according to one of the claims 8 to 14
 
characterized in that
 
the pollutant channel (115) features toward the basin 

interior at least one flushing trough (119) which 
is situated sli ghtly lower than said overflow 

weir (110).
