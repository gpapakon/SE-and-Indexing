<ABSTRACT>
A mixture of V₂O₅, CoO₂, P₂O₅, MO (wherein M represents an 
alkaline earth metal element) and at least one lithium 

compound selected from the group consisting of lithium-oxygen 
compounds, lithium halides and lithium oxygen acid salts is 

melted to form a melt, then the melt is put into water or 
pressed with metal plates to pulverize it, and heat treated 

if necessary, the resulting solid solution being used as a 
cathode material for a lithium battery, thereby obtaining the 

lithium battery preventing the capacity of a carbon anode 
from lowering and excellent in long-term cycle stability.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to cathode materials used 
in lithium batteries in which carbon materials are used as 
anode materials, and methods for producing the same. Various sulfides and oxides have hitherto been proposed 
as cathode materials of lithium batteries. Compound oxides 
and amorphous compounds have also been proposed. For 
example, Japanese Patent Unexamined Publication No. 59-134561/1984 
discloses a cathode active material composed of a 
solid solution prepared by adding phosphorus pentaoxide to 
vanadium pentaoxide and burning the resulting mixture, 
followed by rapid quenching. Japanese Patent Unexamined 
Publication No. 2-33868/1990 discloses a cathode formed of an 
amorphous powder prepared by melting and rapidly quenching a 
mixture of vanadium pentoxide and 30 mol% or less of 
phosphorus pentoxide. Even if these cathode materials are 
used, however, the problem can not be solved that the 
repetition of charge and discharge causes a reduction in 
capacity. Accordingly, no cathode material satisfactory in 
cycle stability has been obtained yet. Further, conductive 
agents are required to be added to the cathode materials 
because of their low conductivity. In spite of the addition  
 
of the conductive agents, a large current flow causes large 
polarization, resulting in decreased energy density. 
Furthermore, as to the amorphous compounds, it has been 
desired to obtain the stable compounds easily. In order to solve these problems, the present inventors 
have already proposed a cathode material for a lithium 
battery comprising an amorphous solid solution comprising 
vanadium pentoxide, diphosphorus pentoxide and an alkaline 
earth metal oxide in a specified ratio, and a method 
producing the same (Japanese Patent Unexamined Publication 
No. 5-299088/1993), and a cathode material for a lithium 
battery comprising an amorphous solid solution comprising 
vanadium pentoxide, diphosphorus pentoxide, an alkaline 
earth metal oxide and cobalt oxide, and a method for 
producing the same (Japanese Patent Unexamined Publication 
No. 5-225981). These vanadium pentoxide cathode materials are 
satisfactory in charge-discharge cycle stability, stable and 
amorphous, and stable amorphous cathode materials can be 
produced by these methods However, when these cathode 
materials are used in combination with carbon anodes, the 
problem arises that the charge capacity is low to the 
discharge capacity in the cathodes at initial cycles. 
Namely, some of lithium remains in the cathodes, and is not
