<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a continuously operating dough kneading 
machine, comprising a housing (6) with an inlet for the dough to be 

kneaded 
and any ingredient to be added and an outlet (7) for the kneaded 

dough, a 
kneading body (1) being journalled in said housing (6) about a 

substantially 
horizontal axis, said kneading body (1) having a number of straight, 

axially 
elongated arms (3,4), which extend substantially radially from the 

axis, said 
arms (3,4) being provided with passage openings (3a,4a) and being 

positioned angularly 
spaced relative to one another. In order to secure an optimal transport 

towards the outlet (7) of the machine in addition to an optimal kneading 
effect also in case of dough material that has poor flowing characteristics 

in the initial stage, a blade element (5) is provided on the 
kneading body (1) at least adjacent the inlet side, said blade element (1) 

exerting - when rotating along with the kneading body (1) - a downstream 
force (component) to the dough material.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a dough kneading machine, comprising a 
housing with an inlet for the dough to be kneaded and any ingredient to 
be added and an outlet for the kneaded dough, a kneading body being 
journalled in said housing about a substantially horizontal axis, said 
kneading body having a number of straight, axially elongated arms, which 
extend substantially radially from the axis, said arms being provided 
with passage openings and being positioned angularly spaced relative to 
one another. Such a dough kneading machine, also called "continunous kneader", is 
known and adapted to be applied in a continuous production line for 
"baked" dough products. Such dough kneading machines function according to the so-called 
"overflow principle", which means that at any moment the amount of 
kneaded dough discharged from the machine corresponds with the amount of 
dough material, that is supplied to the machine for kneading. Consequently 
the amount of dough material supplied to the machine is 
constantly adjusted to the need for kneaded dough in the dough processing 
equipment that is positioned downstream of the dough kneading machine in 
the production line. In order to obtain an optimal kneading effect i.e. to bring the dough 
material from a generally sticky initial state into a state, in which the 
dough material has the desired elasticity, the dough material has to be 
subjected during a certain period of time to the kneading action of the 
rotating kneading arms, the speed of which is in the order of 75 r.p.m. 
The length of the kneading body is therefore selected such, that the 
residence time within the kneading machine which is required for an 
optimal kreading effect, will be secured with the desired (nominal) 
capacity (= amount of dough material that is supplied and discharged per 
time unit). An increase or decrease of the supply and discharge of dough 
material will involve a shortening or lengthening respectively of the 
residence time of the dough material within the machine, which shortening 
or lengthening of time may be compensated within certain limits by having 
the knaading body rotate at a correspondingly higher or lower speed. It has been found in practice, that with certain types of dough the 
production of the kneading machine is not readily controllable according 
to the "overflow principle". Particularly in case of larger capacities, 
i.e. longer kneading bodies, such less readily flowing types of dough 
tend to a residence time which is too long, due to which the dough
