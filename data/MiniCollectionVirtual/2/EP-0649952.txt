<ABSTRACT>
To assure that each spectator sitting on his seat (10) enjoys 
a performance in a theater or the like at his desired height, 

a floor height adjusting mechanism is mounted on each of a 
plurality of movable platforms (1A-1F) 

constituting a floor height variable type expansible/contractible 
multi-staged spectator seating system. Usually, 

the floor height adjusting mechanism is constructed in the 
form of a screw driving unit which is composed of a motor (8), 

a screw shaft (7) adapted to be rotationally driven by the 
motor (8), and a support column (5) fixedly secured to each 

movable platform. The lowermost end of the support column (5) 
is operatively connected to the lowermost end of the screw 

shaft (7) for rotatably holding the screw shaft (7).
 

Otherwise, the floor height adjusting mechanism is constructed 
in the form of a combination of a screw driving unit (21) with a 

moving pulley unit, and this type of floor height adjusting 
mechanism is preferably employable for a lowermost movable 

platform (1A) which requires that an adjustable height can be 
increased.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates generally to a floor height
variable type expansible/contractible multi-staged spectator
seating system usable in a theater, an athletic stadium or the
like. More particularly, the present invention relates to a
multi-staged spectator seating system of the foregoing type
including a plurality of movable platforms each having a
variable floor height.A typical conventional movable platform type spectator seating
system is disclosed in an official gazette of Japanese Utility
Model Laid-Open Publication NO. 63-171561. According to this
prior invention, the spectator seating system includes a
plurality of movable platforms arranged in the spaced
relationship as seen in the upward/downward direction, and one
end of each movable platform is secured via a support arm to a
support column adapted to be raised up and lowered by a
raising/lowering power cylinder to change the floor height of
each movable platform as desired. In addition, a tilting
power cylinder is operatively connected to the support arm so
as to change the tilting angle of the support arm in order to
assure that the height of an upper movable platform as
measured from a lower movable platform is kept constant with
respect to all the movable platforms. However, this
conventional spectator seating system has problems as noted
below. One of the problems is that it is impossible to
individually change the floor height of each movable platform.
The other problem is that the floor height changing mechanism
arranged for each movable platform is complicated in structure
and requires a large space for mounting it in the spectator
seating system. The present invention has been made in consideration of the
aforementioned background.An object of the present invention is to provide a floor
height variable type expansible/ contractible multi-staged
spectator seating system which assures that the height of each
of a plurality of movable platforms can be adjusted as
desired.Another object of the present invention is to provide a floor
height variable type expansible/contractible multi-staged
spectator seating system which assures that an adjustable
height of each of a plurality of moving platforms constituting
the spectator seating system can be increased preferably for
the lowermost movable platform by combining a screw driving
unit with a moving pulley unit.The invention is as defined in the accompanying independent claims 1, 3 and 5.
Independent Claims 1, 3 and 5 have each been divided into a
two-part form based on the assumption
