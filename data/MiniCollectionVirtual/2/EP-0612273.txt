<ABSTRACT>
The present invention includes a method of treating solid earthen material having volatile, semi-volatile, and non-volatile contaminants. Six electrodes are inserted into a region of earthen material to be treated in a substantially equilateral hexagonal arrangement. Six phases of voltages are applied to corresponding electrodes. The voltages are adjusted within a first range of voltages to create multiple current paths between pairs of the electrodes. The current paths are evenly distributed throughout the region defined by the electrodes and therefore uniformly heat the region. The region of earthen material is heated to a temperature sufficient to substantially remove volatile and semi-volatile contaminants by promoting microbial action. This temperature is less than a melting temperature of the earthen material.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a method for treating
solid earthen material.The disposal of contaminated material has become an
increasingly significant problem. Today, contaminated
material, such as industrial and nuclear waste, is buried
underground in specially designed storage containers.
These contaminants buried in the ground typically contain
volatile, semi-volatile, and non-volatile organic contaminants.
Unfortunately, burying the contaminants does not
render them innocuous to the environment. The storage
containers can leak the contaminants into the soil, thereby
polluting the soil. The contaminants may also pass into
underground water tables and contaminate the water supply
for populated regions. Ground contaminants can also result
from surface spills that seep into the soil.One approach to detoxifying organic-contaminated
soils was proposed by Buelt et al. in U.S. Pat. No.
4,957,393, assigned to Battelle Memorial Institute. Buelt
et al. proposed inserting a matrix of electrodes into a
contaminated soil region and applying very high dc voltage
or single phase ac voltage to the electrodes. The voltages
created current paths between the electrodes which effectively
heated the contaminated soil to temperatures ranging
from 100°C to 1200°C. The US-A-A 376 598 discloses a method of vitrifying soil. The method uses two
or more conductive electrode inserted into the soil for heating the soil mass
between them to a temperature above its melting temperature. A two phase
voltage of 4,000 volts is applied as initial voltage, wherein a start up path of
graphit or frit is provided between the electrodes.The US-A- 5,024,556 discloses an apparatus for in situ vitrification comprising a
plurality of electrodes. The apparatus is electrically supplied by way of a transportable
power station delivering three phase power to transformers in a Scott-tee-connection
for providing two phase current to the electrodes. The separators also
requires a start up path of graphite or frit between the electrodes. The present invention arose out of a need to
provide a more energy efficient and less costly system for
treating contaminated soils. The present invention
provides a method for treating contaminated soil which
enables uniform heating of the soil at relatively low
energy costs.Preferred embodiments of the invention are
described below with reference to the following
accompanying drawings.
