<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to an electric heating apparatus comprising a main frame, in which there is mounted on the one hand at least one heating element (10) including a resistive circuit (11), said element (10) being associated with a support plate (15) which is integral with the frame (1), and on the other hand at least one radiation plate (17) which forms a facade of the apparatus, is integral with the frame (1) and mounted at a distance from the heating element (10), characterised in that the heating element (10) consists of a low-temperature flat heating element of sandwich structure, said structure being electrically insulated, preferably on its two faces, by insulating films and stuck via one face on one side of the support plate (15), the other side of the plate (15) being provided with a thermal dissipation element (20). Stationary heating apparatus.

<CLAIMS>
An electric heater appliance comprising a main frame (1) in which 
there are mounted, firstly at least one heater element (10) including 

a resistive circuit (11), said element (10) being associated with a 
support plate (15) secured to the frame (1), and provided with a 

dissipator element (20), and secondly at least one radiating plate 
(17, 17') forming a facade of the appliance, said plate (17, 17') 

being secured to the frame (1) and mounted to be offset from the 
heater element (10), said heater appliance being characterized in 

that the heater element (10) is constituted by a flat, low-temperature 
heater element of sandwich structure, said structure 

being electrically insulated, preferably on both of its faces, by 
insulating film, and being stuck via one face to one side of the 

support plate (15), the other side of the plate (15) being provided 
with the dissipator element (20). 
An appliance according to claim 1, characterized in that the 
dissipator element (20) is constituted by a shaped panel defining a 

series of undulations (21) forming heat exchange surfaces. 
An appliance according to claim 1 or 2, characterized in that it 
is constituted by a stationary appliance comprising a rear fixing 

panel (2) formed by the main frame (1), and a front panel formed by 

the radiating plate (17). 
An appliance according to claim 3, characterized in that the 
heater element (10) is stuck to the side of the support plate (15) 

that is situated facing the radiating panel (17). 
An appliance according to claim 4, characterized in that the 
dissipator element (20) serves both as a spacer between the rear 

panel (2) and the support plate (15) and as a means of fixing said 
plate (15) on the rear panel (2). 
An appliance according to claim 4 or 5, characterized in that the 
radiating panel (17) is a glass- or metal-based plate, the metal-based 

plate preferably being provided with perforations.  
 
An appliance according to claim 3, characterized in that the 
heater element (10) is stuck to the side of the support plate (15) 

that is situated facing the rear fixing panel (2). 
An appliance according to claim 7, characterized in that the 
dissipator element (20) extends between the support plate (15) and 

the radiating panel (17') and is offset therefrom. 
An appliance according to claim 7 or claim 8, characterized in 
that the radiating panel (17') is constituted by a metal plate. 
An appliance according to any one of claims 1 to 9, characterized 
in that the heater element (10) extends over an area smaller than the 

area of the radiating panel (17, 17') and is disposed in the lower 
portion of the support plate (15). 
An appliance according to any one of claims 1 to 10, 
characterized in that the overall thickness of the appliance is less 

than 50 mm, and preferably lies in the range 40 mm to 45 mm.
