<ABSTRACT>
Receiver for digital signals which comprises differential decoding means (10), de-interlacing means and means for convolutional decoding of digital signals received. The differential decoding means (10) reestablish (102) each symbol received (rk) in the original phase which it had on transmission (symbol Zk). This makes it possible to calculate (110) optimal metrics (M@, M@
>
 which are made use of by the convolutional decoding means to supply an optimal decoding of the symbols received. Application: digital signal receiver.

A receiver (5) for digital signals which have successively undergone, on
transmission, a channel coding and a differential coding and which resulting coded

digital signals have been assigned to symbols of a constellation, the receiver comprising
differential decoding means (10) which calculate metrics in response to received

symbols, and channel decoding means (14) for producing decoded digital signals in
response to the calculated metrics, characterized in that the differential decoding means

(10) comprise first means (102) for estimating for each received symbol a rotation phase
which the constellation undergoes and for restoring said received symbol to its original

phase, and second means (110) for calculating optimum metrics in response to received
symbols that have been restored to their original phase.
Receiver as claimed in Claim 1, characterized in that the differential
decoding means comprise third means (103, 107) for calculating a mean noise output

which influences the symbols and for normalizing each received symbol relative to the
mean noise.
Receiver as claimed in one of the Claims 1 or 2, characterized in that the
differential decoding means comprise fourth means (105) for measuring over various

symbols a mean amplitude which is normalized relative to the mean noise and for
calculating said optimum metrics on the basis of said restored symbols and the

normalized mean amplitudes.
Receiver as claimed in one of the Claims 1 to 3, characterized in that the
first means and/or the second means and/or the third means and/or the fourth means

comprise a suitably programmed computer.
Receiver as claimed in one of the Claims 1 to 4, characterized in that the
second means comprise a memory in which precalculated metrics are stored.
Receiver as claimed in one of the Claims 1 to 5, characterized in that the
digital symbols which are transmitted either on a monocarrier or on multicarriers, the

receiver comprises differential decoding means for the monocarrier or for multicarriers.
