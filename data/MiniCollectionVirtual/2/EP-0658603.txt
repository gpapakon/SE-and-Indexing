<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a compatible blend which comprises 
mixed thermoplastic resins and a compatibilizing agent which is an epoxy-modified 
aromatic vinyl-conjugated diene block copolymer, and a process for 
improving mechanical properties in an article molded therefrom. In more detail, the present invention also relates to a compatible 
blend and a process in which the compatibility of mixed thermoplastic 
resins is improved by the addition of a compatibilizing agent, and whereby 
the compatible blend exhibits small particle size dispersion in scanning 
electron microscopic structure observation and excellent homogeneity in 
appearance, resulting in exhibiting an improved flow property together with 
improved mechanical properties, such as impact strength, compared to a 
compatible blend having a conventional compatibilizing agent which is an 
aromatic-conjugated diene block copolymer. Furthermore, the present invention relates to a thermoplastic resin 
composition which comprises a thermoplastic resin and an impact modifier 
which is an epoxy-modified aromatic vinyl-conjugated diene block copolymer. The thermoplastic resin composition exhibits an excellent flow 
property, and an article molded therefrom has excellent heat resistance 
and improved impact strength.  Still further, the present invention relates to a polyalkylene 
terephthalate resin composition which comprises a polyalkylene terephthalate, 
a carboxylic acid and an epoxy-modified aromatic vinyl-conjugated 
diene block copolymer. An article molded from the polyalkylene terephthalate resin composition 
exhibits only a slight loss in improved mechanical strength even after 
repeatedly molding. In addition, the present invention relates to a polycarbonate resin 
composition which comprises a polycarbonate, a compound having a functional 
group, and an epoxy-modified aromatic vinyl-conjugated diene block 
copolymer. An article molded from the polycarbonate resin composition has 
an excellent frosting surface without the addition of inorganic fillers and 
without embossing or frosting. Besides, the present invention relates to a rubber-like resin 
composition which comprises a rubber-like polymer and an epoxy-modified 
aromatic vinyl-conjugated diene block copolymer. Further, the present invention relates to an epoxy resin composition 
having an epoxy-modified aromatic vinyl-conjugated diene block copolymer. An article molded from the epoxy resin composition has excellent 
ductility. Also, the present invention relates to a vinyl
