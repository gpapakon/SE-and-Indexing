<ABSTRACT>
A measuring instrument for detecting photosystem II herbicides in aqueous solutions is described. The measuring instrument consists of an excitation-light source (1) which briefly emits light of a wavelength between 400 and 700 nm, for example a laser diode (12), two cuvettes (3, 4; 16), filled with a suspension of a chlorophyll-containing photosynthesis preparation, which are intended to hold a sample solution and a reference solution, two photodetectors (6, 7; 14), which respectively register exclusively the fluorescence light emitted by the suspensions, a device (8, 10) in which the difference of the photodetector signals is taken, for example a microcomputer, and at least one reoxidation-light source (9; 13) in the form of a LED, which briefly radiates light of a wavelength between 700 and 800 nm into the two cuvettes.
