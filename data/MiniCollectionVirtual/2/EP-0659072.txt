<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to novel oil-in-water emulsions especially
suitable for parenteral administration of bioactive steroids which otherwise are
difficult to solubilize. The emulsions will comprise a lipid phase containing
castor oil that can comprise complementary lipids such as at least one vegetable
oil and/or medium chain triglycerides.Many therapeutically useful steroids are noted to have poor solubility in
conventional pharmaceutical vehicles or solvents and it is attempted to increase
their solubility, for example by introducing solubility modifying groups or by
improving the properties of the vehicles for administration.The British Patent Specifications GB 1 317 184 and GB 1 379 730 disclose
anaesthetic compositions for the delivery of 3a-hydroxy-5a-pregnane-11,20-dione.
These compositions which were accomplished as parenteral
preparations of steroids together with a non-ionic surface active
polyoxyethylated castor oil (Cremophor-EL) had, however, serious side-effects.The European patent EP 0 233 849 discloses parenterally administerable
lipid emulsions of 3a-hydroxy-5β-pregnan-20-one (pregnanolone), wherein the
active steroid is dissolved in a lipid phase selected from coconut oil, borage oil,
safflower oil, cotton seed oil, soybean oil and synthetic glycerides, having a
mixture of long and medium chain fatty adds in the molecule.Castor oil has previously been suggested as a vehicle for parenteral
administration of steroid hormones together with organic co-solvents, such as
benzyl alcohol and benzyl benzoate, as disclosed by C Riffkin et al in J. of
Pharm. Sci., Vol. 53(8), 1964, pag. 891-5, or according to the American patent
specification US 4 048 310, as a vehicle in topical preparations. The suggested
co-solvents according to Riffkin et al., would, however, hardly be accepted as
ingredients in a pharmaceutical preparation for parenteral use today.The European patent application EP 0 418 004 discloses fat emulsions as
carriers for compounds having prostaglandin E1 activities, which have a lipid
phase containing an oil chosen from soybean oil, sesame oil, castor oil, cotton
seed oil or olive oil. These emulsions will, however, beside a phospholipid
emulsifier also contain an emulsifying adjuvant, preferably in the form of free 
fatty adds and a stabilizer. The level of free fatty adds is generally attempted to
be kept as low as possible in parenteral emulsions in order to avoid the adverse
effects disclosed in e.g. The Lancet, April 18 1970, pages 813 to 815 (V.A. Kurien
et al.) and
