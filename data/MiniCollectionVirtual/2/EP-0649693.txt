In order to enhance the quality of metal alloy products which are treated 
while being cast, the disclosure proposes a process and a moulding assembly, 

comprising at least a moulding cavity, an open treating basin, a reaction 
chamber, a consumable plug plugging the passage connecting said cavity to 

said reaction chamber and a treating alloy in said plugged reaction chamber. 
The consumable plug will maintain the passage closed for a preselected period 

of time until its melting so as to allow the uniform metallurgical treatment 
of the melt by the treating agents.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates generally to the field of 
metal founding and, more particularly, to an improved method and 
system for treating and casting metals. Heretofore, a number of techniques have been proposed for 
treating cast metals alloys, such as the various ferrous metal 
alloys. These include sandwich, tundish, flotret, sigmat, and 
inmold processes which form the bulk of the processes used in the 
ductile iron processing. Among all these different processes the 
inmold process achieves the highest treatment efficiency. In the 
inmold process, which this invention comes closest to, chemically 
reactive agents are introduced into a molding assembly prior to 
pouring of the casting metal so as to treat such metals prior to 
entering the molding cavities, thereby imparting certain 
characteristics to the cast metal. For example, in the casting 
of ferrous metals, the treating chemicals can include magnesium 
and rare earths. The present invention relates to an improvement over 
heretofore known methods, for instance, the inmold process using 
vertically parted mold cavities for the production of modular 
ductile iron castings. Due to several difficulties experienced 
in the practical utilization of the inmold process on vertically 
parted molds, different versions of the treatment method have  
 
been tried in the past. In all cases the reaction chamber is 
located directly underneath or close to the pouring cup to 
facilitate the alloy addition. In the more popular version, for 
example, chemical reactive agents, much as certain nodularizing 
alloys containing modifiers, such as calcium and magnesium, are 
introduced into a separate reaction chamber which is separate 
from the receiving basin. The reaction chamber is offset with 
respect to a receiving basin in the initial part of a runner 
system leading to the molding cavity. In this approach, the 
treatment operation commences with passing the molten metal 
through a reaction chamber which chamber has a specific amount of 
treating material therein, for example magnesium ferrosilicon, in 
order to react with cast iron. A meltable metal plug is inserted 
in the bottom of the receiving basin directly over a downsprue 
leading to the molding cavity. This is done in order to restrain 
flow to the molding cavity for a time sufficient to alloy the 
treating material with the molten metal to be cast. Until the 
metal plug melts, the poured metal is retained in the basin for a 
preselected period of time so that the reaction products and 
other
