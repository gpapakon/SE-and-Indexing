<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to an elastic springy element
comprising a tubular body of foam which is provided with
holes directed inwards from the outside.Such an elastic springy element is known from Belgian
patent No. 859.468. Such springy elements can
advantageously be applied as a replacement of steel
springs as building elements for seats, matresses,
cushions and the like.The foam can be synthetic foam, such as for instance
polyurethane foam, as well as natural foam, such as
natural latex.Not only do these springy foam elements offer excellent
springy properties and optimal comfort, but they can
also be easily glued to layers for forming a springy
supporting element such as a matress. Steel springs, to
the contrary, have to be attached to each other, for
instance stitched together, to form a stable supporting
element. For this reason, steel springs are often
packed individually in textile bags which are glued to
each other or sewn together with their feet or heads.
However, these bags hinder the air circulation in the
supporting element.However, in a fatigue test, the known foam springs,
usually of polyurethane foam, lose a part of their
initial hardness, namely about 20%, unless high density
foam is used, which is very expensive, though. The invention aims at remedying this disadvantage and to
provide an elastic springy element which even better
characteristics than the known foam spring.This aim is realized according to the invention by the
fact that the elastic springy element comprises a wire
spring which is surrounded by the body.A wire spring here refers to a spring from the group
formed by a spiral spring, a cylindrical spring, a
so-called Bonnell spring or a so-called offset spring or
the like.It has been noticed that by combining a foam body and a
wire spring located therein, an unexpected synergic
effect is developed, and considerably better
characteristics are obtained than by a foam body alone
or a wire spring alone.In a preferred embodiment of the invention the wire
spring is a steel wire spring.However, in an other embodiment the wire spring can be
made of synthetic material.In a particular embodiment of the invention, the inside
of the tubular foam body is round and also the wire
spring is round with a largest diameter which
corresponds with the inner diameter of the body.In a remarkable embodiment of the invention, the length
of the wire spring in position of rest is equal to the
length of the tubular body in position of rest. In an other remarkable embodiment of the invention,
the length
