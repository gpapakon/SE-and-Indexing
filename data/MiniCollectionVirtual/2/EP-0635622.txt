<ABSTRACT>
A landing nipple (10) for use in a locking system 
to releasably position well flow control devices in a flow 

conduit of a well. 
The landing nipple (10) is mounted in a conduit 
for sealably and lockably receiving a lock mandrel, and 

includes: 

(a) helically profiled segments (14) with orienting 
camming surfaces (14a) on their upper end; and 
(b) a metal sealing seat (14h) located below the 
segments.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a landing nipple, and, in particular, to a
landing nipple for use in a locking system useful to releasably position well flow
control devices in a flow conduit of a well.Known locking systems are described in US patents nos. 2,673,614
(to Ira A. Miller) and 3,208,531 (to Jack W. Tamplen). In both these systems, the
running tool moves the lock mandrel downwardly into sealing and locking
engagement with a compatible landing nipple in a well flow conduit.GB-A-2158127 discloses an annulus sub-surface safety valve
adapted for installation between inner and outer concentric tubular members. The
valve can be releasably locked to the outer member. The valve includes a fluid
passageway that can be opened and closed, and the valve is locked to the outer
member when the valve is moved to the closed position.Our European application 91306289.9 describes and claims a rotary
locking system which comprises:
(a) a landing nipple having connecting means for connecting the
nipple in a conduit, first locking means and a metal seat;(b) lock mandrel means having a metal sealing surface which is
sealingly engageable with the metal seat in the landing nipple
and second locking means; and(c) running tool means having a connector assembly; wherein the
connector assembly of the running tool means is engageable
with the lock mandrel means and rotatable to rotate the lock
mandrel means to bring the second locking means into
engagement with the first locking means of the landing nipple,
and to bring the metal seat into seal with the sealing surface;
and said connecting assembly is releasable from engagement
with said lock 
mandrel means on application of a rotating force
by said running tool means on said lock mandrel
means.This application, which is divided therefrom,
relates to a landing nipple suitable for use with such
locking systems, and, in particular, a landing nipple
connectible in a conduit for sealably and lockably receiving
a rotary lock mandrel, characterised in that
(a) helically profiled segments are provided on
the landing nipple, each said segment having
orienting camming surfaces on the upper end
thereof; and(b) a metal sealing seat located below said segments.In use the landing nipple is located in a well
conduit, and a well flow control device connected to a lock
mandrel and running tool is lowered into the well conduit so
that the lock mandrel engages the landing nipple.The lock mandrel has a metal sealing surface and
helically profiled segments with lower orienting surfaces.
