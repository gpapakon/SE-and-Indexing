<ABSTRACT>
The present invention discloses novel acylated 
compounds of formula (I) and 

an efficient method of producing same from free catechins. Moreover, 
since these acylated catechin compounds have a much more superior 

solubility in fats and oils than any catechins previously known, 
they may be used as a highly effective antioxidative agents, 


wherein X is an alkyl group of 1-10 carbon atoms, and R is a 
hydrogen atom or a hydroxyl group.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to 3-0-acylated catechin, the 
method of producing same and the use of same as an antioxidant. Catechins are a type of polyphenol found in the roots, bark, 
seeds and leaves of various plants, in particular they are found in tea 
leaves (10-20% on a dried tea basis). Recently catechins have been 
discovered to have anti-oxidative, anti-bacterial, anti-viral, 
anti-mutagenic, anti-tumor properties, and to prevent a rise in blood 
glucose and cholesterol levels and blood pressure. Out of all of these physiological properties, in particular the 
anti-oxidative property of tea polyphenols is strong, being not only 
superior to vitamin E which has been used up until now, but also 
having a superior anti-photo-oxidative effect on fats and oils. 
Thus it is expected that tea catechins may be used as a natural 
anti-oxidant. However, one problem is that catechins have a low oil-solubility 
and so do not easily dissolve in fats and oils. The present invention relates to a novel 3-0-acylated catechin 
with superior oil solubility, and an effective, efficient method of 
producing this compound. The present invention relates also to the  
 
use of the catechin as an antioxidative agent for lipids etc., and with 
the problem of low oil-solubility as mentioned above being resolved, 
it is expected that more superior antioxidative agent for fats and oils 
than has been available up until now, can be developed. Therefore, an object of the present invention is to find a solution to the 
problem of low oil-solubility as mentioned above. This object has been achieved by the 
finding that by using the method of transesterification by carboxylesterase, a catechin 
acyl derivative with superior lipophilicity could be obtained expediently and efficiently. The present invention relates to a 3-0-acylated catechin 
compound, which is represented by structural formula 1, 
wherein X is an alkyl group of 1-10 carbon atoms, and R is a hydrogen atom or a 
hydroxyl group. The present invention furthermore relates to a process for the 
production of 3-O-acylated catechin compounds of above formula 1 which is 
characterized by the carboxylesterase action on free catechins as shown in formula 2, 
wherein R is a hydrogen atom or a hydroxyl group, and the carboxylesterase 
action on ester compounds as shown in formula 3, 
wherein X is an alkyl group of 1-10 carbon atoms, and X' is an aromatic group, 
glyceryl, acylglyceryl or an alkyl group of 1-10 carbon atoms. Preferably the 
aromatic group has 6-10 carbon
