<ABSTRACT>
A method of treating a mammal comprises administering to a mammal an effective amount to provide a desired therapeutic effect in the mammal of a compound selected from the group consisting of those having formula (1), pharmaceutically acceptable acid addition salts thereof and mixtures thereof, wherein R1 and R4 are independently selected from the group consisting of H and alkyl radicals having 1 to 4 carbon atoms; the R2s are independently selected from H or alkyl radicals having 1 to 4 carbon atoms or are, together, oxo; the R3s are independently selected from H or alkyl radicals having 1 to 4 carbon atoms or are, together, oxo; the 2-imidazolin-2-ylamino group may be in any of the 5-, 6-, 7- or 8-positions of the quinoxaline nucleus; and R5, R6 and R7 each is located in one of the remaining 5-, 6-, 7- or 8-positions of the quinoxaline nucleus and is independently selected from the group consisting of Cl, Br, H and alkyl radicals having 1 to 3 carbon atoms. Such compounds, when administered to a mammal, provide desired therapeutic effects, such as reduction in peripheral pain, anesthetization of the central nervous system, constriction of one or more blood vessels, reduction in or prevention of at least one effect of ischemia, decongestion of one or more nasal passages, and reduction of at least one effect of an inflammatory disorder.

<DESCRIPTION>
This application is a continuation-in-part of patent
application Serial No. 758,696 filed September 12, 1991
which, in turn, is a division of patent application Serial
No. 420,817 filed October 12, 1989; and a continuation-in-part
of patent application Serial No. 560,776 filed July
31, 1990 which, in turn, is a continuation-in-part of
application Serial No. 420,817 filed October 12, 1989. The
disclosures of each of these prior applications is
incorporated in its entirety herein by reference.The present invention relates to novel substituted
derivatives of quinoxaline. More particularly, the
invention relates to such derivatives which are useful as
therapeutic agents, for example, to effect reduction in
intraocular pressure, to increase renal fluid flow and to
effect an alteration in the rate of fluid transport in the
gastrointestinal tract.Various quinoxaline derivatives have been suggested
as therapeutic agents. For example, Danielewicz, et al
U.S. Patent 3,890,319 discloses compounds as regulators of
the cardiovascular system which have the following
formula:

where the 2-imidazolin-2-ylamino group may be in any of
the 5-, 6-, 7- or 8- position of the quinoxaline nucleus;
X, Y and Z may be in any of the remaining
5-, 6-, 7- or 8- positions and may be selected from
hydrogen, halogen, lower alkyl, lower alkoxy or 
trifluoromethyl; and R is an optional substituent in
either the 2- or 3- position of the quinoxaline nucleus
and may be hydrogen, lower alkyl or lower alkoxy.New methods for treating mammals, preferably human
beings, to provide a desired therapeutic effect have been
discovered. By administering an effective amount of one
or more of certain compounds to a mammal, a desired
therapeutic effect is provided in the mammal. Such
desired therapeutic effects include reduction in
peripheral pain, anesthetization of the central nervous
system, constriction of one or more blood vessels,
reduction in or prevention of at least one effect of
ischemia, decongestion of one or more nasal passages, and
reduction in at least one effect of an inflammatory
disorder.The compounds which are administered in the methods
of the present invention are those having the formula:

and pharmaceutically acceptable acid addition salts
thereof and mixtures thereof, wherein R1 and R4 are
independently selected from the group consisting of H and
alkyl radicals having 1 to 4 carbon atoms; the R2s are
independently selected from H or alkyl radicals having 1
to 4 carbon atoms or are, together, oxo; the R3s are
independently selected
