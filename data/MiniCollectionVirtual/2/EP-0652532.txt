<ABSTRACT>
A character recognition apparatus is provided which, even 
when there occurs a local positional deviation of a 

character to be recognized, can stably recognize the 
character with high accuracy. For each contour point of a 

character image, a contouring direction code imparting unit 
15 obtains a contouring direction code in which a contouring 

line direction of the character is quantized in four 
directions. A contouring direction code frequency 

calculation unit 16 calculates the frequency of each 
contouring direction code for each subregion of the 

character image. A contouring direction code density 
calculation unit 17 calculates the density of the contouring 

direction codes of each subregion, by using the frequency of 
the direction codes and the size of the respective 

subregion. A contouring direction code space blurring unit 
18 conducts a weighted addition on each of the obtained 

contouring direction codes by adding, with a predetermined 
weight coefficient, the contouring direction code densities 

of neighbor subregions which are adjacent to the respective 
subregion with the subregion as the center and in a 

direction perpendicular to that of each of the contouring 
direction codes.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a character recognition
apparatus which recognizes printed characters of a
newspaper, a magazine or the like, and hand-written
characters, as set forth in the preamble of claim 1. An apparatus
of this kind is known from GB-A-2 190 778.Another character recognition apparatus of the prior art is
disclosed in, for example, Japanese patent publication
(Kokai) No. SHO61-125688.Fig. 16 is a diagram showing the configuration of the
prior art character recognition apparatus. In Fig. 16, 101
designates an image input unit through which an image
including a recognition object character is input, and 102
designates a character segmentation unit which separates a
rectangular segment of a character image of the recognition
object from the image input to the image input unit 101.
The reference numeral 103 designates a contour direction
feature extraction unit which obtains a contour direction 
feature matrix for detecting a character from the
rectangular character image segment obtained by the
character segmentation unit 102. A contouring direction
feature matrix indicates a feature of a character by means
of the directionality of a contour line of the character.
The reference numeral 104 designates a recognition
dictionary which stores contouring direction feature matrices
for all character categories of recognition objects, and 105
designates a character recognition unit which checks the
contour direction feature matrix obtained by the
contour direction feature extraction unit 103 with the
contour direction feature matrices stored in the
recognition dictionary 104, to extract recognition candidate
characters.The contouring direction feature extraction unit 103
consists of a contour direction code imparting unit 106,
and a contouring direction code frequency calculation unit
106. The contour direction code imparting unit 106
determines contour direction codes (including four kinds
of codes respectively indicative of horizontal, vertical,
upper right, and lower right directions) of contour points
of the character image of the recognition object separated
by the character segmentation unit 102. The contour
direction code frequency calculation unit 107 calculates the 
frequencies of the contour direction codes obtained by
the contour direction code imparting unit 106, in each of
subregions obtained by dividing the rectangle which is
separated by the character segmentation unit 102 into M and
N sections in horizontal and vertical directions (where M
and N are arbitrary natural numbers).The
