<ABSTRACT>
A slide (3) is displaceably guided in feed direction (A) on guides (1) of a frame (2). The slide (3) carries an ultrasonic machining apparatus (4) and is loaded with an adjustable force in feed direction (A) by a first cylinder (7). Fastened to the slide (3) is a cylinder (15), around which a cable (17) is wrapped with a loop (16) of 360 degrees. One end (18) of the cable (17) is preloaded by a prestressed spring (20) against a stop (21) fixed to the housing. The other end (22) of the cable (17) is fastened to the piston rod (24) of a second cylinder (25). During the machining, the tool (5) can be lifted from the workpiece (6) by this second cylinder irrespective of the slide position. After the tool (5) has been lifted, it comes down again gently onto the renewed abrasion layer.
