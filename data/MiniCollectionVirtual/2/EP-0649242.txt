<ABSTRACT>
A circuit for applying a direct current to a winding. 
One end of a primary winding (T
3a
) of a transformer (T₃) is 
connected to a first transistor (Q₁) via a resistor (R₁). 

The other end of the primary winding (T
3a
) is connected to a 
second transistor (Q₂). The first and second transistors 

(Q₁, Q₂) constitute a current mirror circuit (10). By by-passing 
through a capacitor (C₂), no alternating current 

flows in the first transistor (Q₁). The primary winding 
(T
3a
) of the transformer (T₃) includes a center tap (T
3b
) 
and an AC/DC superimposed signal is input to the primary 

winding (T
3a
) via the center tap (T
3b
). In the primary 
winding (T
3a
), DC components flow so as to mutually negate 
DC-magnetization. As a result, there is no need to provide 

a gap in a magnetization circuit and the construction of the 
whole circuit including the transformer (T₃) can be 

miniaturized with improved characteristics.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a circuit for applying
a direct current to a winding of a transformer, a choke coil
or the like used in a variety of transmission circuits. A circuit of this kind is for example described in the Japanese Patent Abstract, vol. 7, no. 103 (E-173) (1248 & JP-A-58 025 755.In a conventional facsimile apparatus, for example, in
order to pick up an alternating current (AC) component from
a signal containing a direct current (DC) component and the
AC component, a transformer shown in Fig. 4 is used. In
this drawing, a primary winding of a transformer T1 and a
choke coil L1 are connected in parallel with each other via
a DC-isolation capacitor C1 and a secondary winding of the
transformer T1 is coupled with a load impedance Z. Hence,
when an AC/DC superimposed signal is input to the circuit of
the primary winding side of the transformer T1, only the AC
component is applied to the transformer T1. However, in
this construction, the choke coil L1 becomes large and as a
result, the size of this entire circuit also becomes large.
Further, since the choke coil L1 is used, the cost of the 
parts become expensive.In order to solve such a problem, for instance, a
DC-superimposable transformer T2 can be used without
requiring the choke coil L1 and the DC-isolation
capacitor C1, as shown in Fig. 5. In this
DC-superimposable transformer T2, a large gap is provided
in its magnetic path so as to negate the influence of the
DC-magnetization, permitting the applying of the DC
component.However, in the construction shown in Fig. 5, since
the gap is provided so as to kill the influence of the
DC-magnetization, the external shape and size of a core of
the transformer T2 becomes large and thus its overall
dimension becomes large. For example, in the use in the
aforementioned facsimile apparatus, numbers of turns of the
primary and secondary windings of the transformer T2 are
each 1600 and its core size is 35 mm (a so-called EI-35).
Furthermore, in this case, even when such a large sized
transformer T2 is used, large attenuation of
approximately 3 dB at 100 Hz is results, as shown in Fig. 6.A circuit according to the present invention is a
circuit for applying a direct current to a winding of a
transformer or a coil and comprises:
a) a current mirror circuit having a diode side
circuit connected to one side of the winding and a
transistor side circuit connected to another side of the
winding, the winding having a center tap through which a
signal current is input to the winding, the signal current
