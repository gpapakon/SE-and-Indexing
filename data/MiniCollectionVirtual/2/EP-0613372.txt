<ABSTRACT>
The present invention relates to the field of therapeutical chemistry and more particularly to pharmacotechny. Specially, the present invention relates to new compositions adapted to local administration and more precisely to forms intended to be placed in the subcutaneous tissues and commonly called implants. Said implants are of various natures (hydrophobic, hydrophilic, biodegradable) and of various types (reservoir, matrix). Said implants incorporate an efficient dose of a derivative of 3,20-dioxo 6-methyl 17(alpha)-acetoxy 19-nor pregna 4,6-diene optionally substituted in the 3 and/or 17(alpha) position, associated or mixed with a biologically acceptable inert excipient. The implants thus obtained are efficient contraceptive agents having an active duration of a least one year with minimum secondary effects.
