<ABSTRACT>
Waste materials containing pathogenic microorganisms may be processed by a method comprising granulating the waste material; treating the granulated waste material by heating at a temperature of about 160 to about 200  DEG C at a pressure of about 90 to about 226 psi in an atmosphere of the steam from a non-isotonic salt solution. The treatment is conducted for a period of time sufficient to substantially reduce the amount of pathogenic microorganisms present in the waste material. After treatment, the material is separated into useful solid and liquid phases.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention is directed to methods for 
the treatment of biomedical and other infectious wastes. 
More specifically, the present invention is directed to 
methods for processing wastes containing pathogenic 
microorganisms to substantially reduce or eliminate the 
amount of pathogens present therein and to generate safer, 
industrially useful products. Various methods for treating or processing waste 
containing infectious material, i.e., waste containing 
various pathogenic microorganisms, are known in the art, 
and various technologies have been tested in attempts to 
effectively sterilize such wastes. However, the known, 
conventional processes have inherent disadvantages which 
limit their use.  
 The currently most widely used method of 
sterilizing or treating infectious wastes utilize thermal 
degradation as the primary treatment mechanism. The 
elevated temperatures used in these processes are 
generally achieved through dry air, steam or flame in 
order to sterilize infectious microorganisms by partial 
molecular degradation at lower temperatures or total 
molecular destruction at high temperatures. An example of this type of method is the 
autoclave, which uses a combination of vacuum and 
pressurized steam to treat clinical products, such as 
instruments and containers, as well as to decontaminate 
post-patient care materials prior to disposal. The 
limitations of such sterilization systems include the 
possible escape of aerosolized and liquid borne pathogens 
through the drain and exhaust ports of the system; the 
incomplete sterilization of materials containing pathogens 
resistant to the temperatures used; possible inadequate 
steam penetration to the center of the waste load; and the 
continuing requirement of storing, transporting and 
disposing the treated material, generally utilizing 
further incineration or landfills. Thus, this technology 
creates a secondary environmental problem relating to the 
disposal of the treated waste and is not designed to 
create any useful by-products from the treated materials.  
 Another conventional process utilizing thermal 
technology is incineration, which is presently the most 
commonly used infectious waste treatment method in the 
world. However, this technology is now coming under 
severe environmental criticism, and is subject to strict 
regulatory standards. In many instances, incineration is 
being banned entirely because of the likelihood that 
hazardous products are generated thereby. Thus, new 
guidelines regarding incineration
