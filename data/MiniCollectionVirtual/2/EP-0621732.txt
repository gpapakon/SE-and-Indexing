<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an image quality
correction circuit for correcting the quality of the images
produced by video equipment, such as television receivers,
video cameras, and the like.In the NTSC, PAL, and SECAM television signal transmission
systems, wide-band three primary color signals, R,
G, and B, are first subjected to gamma correction, which is
necessary to compensate for the equipment characteristic at
the receiving end, and are then converted into a luminance
signal Y and color-difference signals, R-Y and B-Y, or
chrominance signals, I and Q, for transmission, the
bandwidths being limited to about 0.5 to 1.5 MHz for the
color-difference signals or chrominance signals.The gamma correction and color-difference signal
bandwidth limiting performed at the transmitting end,
however, result in the introduction of nonlinearity in the
transmitted signal, and in the case of a high color
saturation image, high-frequency components contained
therein cannot be reproduced satisfactorily which normally 
should be reproduced completely by the luminance signal
alone. In other words, the high-frequency component level
of the luminance signal degrades in the high color saturation
areas of the image, and fine details of the original
scene cannot be displayed sufficiently. It is also known
that black level variations and saturation drops occur in
the high-frequency component areas of a high color saturation
image.Image quality correction circuits designed to prevent
such image quality degradations include one such as disclosed
in Japanese Patent Application Laid-Open No. 64-32588
(1989). Fig. 1 shows a block diagram for the image quality
correction circuit disclosed therein. The luminance signal
Y is inputted to a high-pass filter 63 and also to a delay
circuit 65. The high-frequency component of the luminance
signal passed through the high-pass filter 63 is fed to a
variable gain amplifier 64 whose output signal is supplied
to an adder 66. Also inputted to the adder 66 is the
luminance signal Y delayed through the delay circuit 65.
The adder 66 adds together the high-frequency component of
the luminance signal fed from the variable gain amplifier 64
and the luminance signal Y delayed through the delay circuit
65, and outputs a corrected luminance signal Y'.On the other hand, the color-difference signal R-Y is
inputted to a full-wave rectifier 10, and the full-wave 
rectified color difference signal R-Y is inputted to an
adder 13. Similarly, the color-difference signal B-Y is
inputted to a full-wave
