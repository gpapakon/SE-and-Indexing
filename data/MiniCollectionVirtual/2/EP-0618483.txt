<ABSTRACT>
This invention provides a process for 
preparing a bleach accelerator silver salt dispersion 

by precipitating a salt of a bleach accelerating 
compound and a silver salt wherein the vAg is 

maintained at a predetermined level during the 
precipitation. This invention further provides a 

photographic element containing a dispersion of grains 
of a bleach accelerator silver salt wherein the grains 

are isomorphic or derived from needle or platelet 
isomorphic crystals.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to processes for 
forming dispersions of bleach accelerator silver salts 
useful in accelerating the bleaching of developed 
silver halide color photographic elements. It further 
relates to photographic elements containing such bleach 
accelerator silver salts. A color image is formed in a color 
photographic element by generation of an imagewise 
distribution of the dye as a function of silver halide 
development. It is common practice to remove the 
silver image formed on development and the silver 
halide remaining in unexposed areas of the element. 
This is accomplished by a bleaching step in which the 
silver image is oxidized by a suitable oxidizing agent, 
commonly referred to as a bleaching agent, followed by 
dissolving the silver halide in a silver halide 
solvent, commonly referred to as a fixing agent. 
Alternatively, the bleaching agent and the fixing agent 
can be combined in a bleach-fixing solution and the 
silver removed in one step by the use of such a 
solution. Various compounds known as bleach 
accelerators are often used to accelerate the bleaching 
process. One class of compounds, substituted thiols, 
have been found to accelerate bleaching either when 
directly added to the bleaching solution or, if 
introduced via a prebath, before the bleaching step. 
See, for example, U.S. Patent 3,893,858. U.S. Patent 4,163,669 suggests that there is 
an advantage to incorporating a bleach accelerator 
directly in a photographic film but that incorporation  
 
of a free thiol would have adverse effects on the 
photographic properties of the film. U.S Patent 
4,163,669 suggests incorporating in a photographic 
element certain bleach accelerators as salts of a heavy 
metal ion. Among the bleach accelerators mentioned are 
the organic thiols of the type described in U.S. Patent 
3,893,858. In order to obtain bleach accelerator silver 
salt dispersions which can be readily incorporated into 
a silver-halide photographic film and which remains in 
stable suspension during storage, the particle size of 
the bleach accelerator silver salt crystals should be 
relatively small, for example, less than 3 microns. 
This small particle size has heretofore been obtained 
by catastrophically precipitating the bleach 
accelerator silver salt crystals and then incorporating 
them into photographic elements by a variety of 
techniques. Especially preferred techniques include 
homogenizing or ball milling a slurry of the compound 
in the presence of a surfactant to form finely divided 
pa
