<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a method of laying a very long product (40) into the ground, consisting in segmenting the ground while at the same time depositing a tube (pipe) (13) and, at the same time, pulling the product, from one end, through the tube by means of a magnetic driving device (14) comprising a yoke and a core housed in the yoke, these pieces being arranged in order to produce, between them, a radial magnetic field suitable for axially immobilising the core with respect to the yoke, the tube passing through the air gap between the yoke and the core and the product being fixed to the core. The pulling force on the product is produced by moving the yoke. The invention also relates to an associated laying device as well as the magnetic driving device itself.

Method for laying down in the ground a product
of great length together with the laying down of a

protective tube designed to surround said product,
including the step of breaking up the ground to form a

furrow while laying down into said furrow, as its building
proceeds, a certain length of a tube (13) suitable for

housing said product (40') with a certain amount of play,
characterized in that, as the laying down of said tube (13)

proceeds, the product is pulled by its free end inside the
tube, in the same direction as the laying down of the tube,

by means of a magnetic pulling device (14) comprising a
tubular yoke (16) through which the tube (13) can pass with

a certain amount of play, and a cylindrical core (15)
capable of being housed with a certain amount of play in

the tube, the yoke and the core having magnetic means (23-27;31-33)
arranged to produce a radial magnetic field

between them and through said tube (13), and capable of
preventing the core (15) from moving axially with respect

to the yoke (16), said end of the product being attached to
said core, a traction being exerted on the product when

said yoke (16) is moved parallel to the furrow as building
of the latter proceeds.
Device for laying down in the ground a product
of great length (40) placed in a tube (13), including a

subsoiler (1) on which are mounted breaking means (5)
arranged to break up the ground to form a furrow to a depth

corresponding to the depth at which the product is laid,
and a tube reel (11) capable of supplying a length of tube

substantially equal to that of the product to be laid,
characterized in that on said subsoiler is mounted a

magnetic pulling device for pulling the product (40) inside
the tube (13), said magnetic pulling device being placed

between the tube reel (11) and the breaking means (5), and
comprising a tubular yoke (16) through which the tube (13)

can pass with a certain amount of play and a cylindrical
core (15) suitable for being housed with a certain amount 

of play in the tube, the yoke and the core having magnetic
means (23-27;31-33) arranged to produce a radial magnetic

field between them and through said tube, and capable of
preventing the core (15) from moving axially with respect

to the yoke (16), the yoke being fixed to the subsoiler and
the core including means suitable for attaching to it one

end of the product.
Laying device according to claim 2, wherein the
product (40) is wound around a product reel (41) provided

with support means (42), whereby said product reel rests on
the ground upstream of said furrow.
Laying device according to claim 2,
characterized in that said magnetic means comprise, on the

yoke (16) and on the core (15), a plurality of polar
elements (24,25;32,33) made of a ferromagnetic material and

juxtaposed along a longitudinal axis of the yoke, each
polar element being separated from the adjacent polar

elements by a permanent magnet (23;31).
Device according to claim 4, wherein said
magnets (23) and polar elements (24,25) borne by the yoke

are shaped as crowns, whereas those (31-33) borne by the
core are shaped as discs the thickness of which is

comparable to that of said crowns, the crowns and the discs
extending perpendicularly to the longitudinal axis of the

yoke.
