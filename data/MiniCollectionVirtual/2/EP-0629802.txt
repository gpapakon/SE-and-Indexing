<ABSTRACT>
In the pressure control valve (pressure relief valve) a means of draining the pressure medium is provided ahead of the spring space (13), for which purpose the transverse holes (14) provided there are widened to form a water pocket (18) of enlarged volume. This water pocket forms a ring around the valve plunger (8), which is exposed in this area, and is connected via return holes (19) to the return line. The water pocket with its correspondingly large volume ensures that the back pressure acts simultaneously on the spring (4) and on the valve plunger, so that the neutralisation described occurs.
