<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a stable oil-in-water emulsion comprising an oily phase dispersed in an aqueous phase with an emulsifying system. More precisely, the emulsifying system contains a first ester chosen from esters of fatty acid and glucose and esters of fatty acid and alkyl glucose and at least a second ester of fatty acid and sucrose. The emulsion according to the invention can be used in the cosmetic and dermatological field for the preparation of a skin cream.
