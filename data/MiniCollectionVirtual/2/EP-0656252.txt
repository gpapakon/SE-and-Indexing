<ABSTRACT>
Process for manufacturing a laminated material exhibiting a low coefficient of friction, made of a stack of a layer of expanded metal and of at least one polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) tape, by compression and heating. It is characterised in that the stack (1, 2, 3) is firstly calendered and then the calendered stack (1, 2, 3) is heated in order to sinter the PTFE (1, 3).

Process for manufacturing a material in sheet 
form, having a low coefficient of friction, from a stack 

of a ply of expanded metal and of at least one 
polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) tape, by compression and 

heating, characterized in that the stack (1, 2, 3) is 
firstly calendered and then the calendered stack (1, 2, 

3) is heated in order to sinter the PTFE (1, 3). 
Process according to Claim 1, characterized in 
that during the calendering of the stack (1, 2, 3) the 

latter extends by 10 to 25%. 
Process according to Claim 1, characterized in 
that during the calendering of the stack (1, 2, 3) the 

latter is subjected to a pressure of approximately 500 kg 
per cm
2
. 
Process according to Claim 1, characterized in 
that two PTFE tapes (1, 3) are arranged on either side of 

the ply of expanded metal (2). 
Process according to Claim 1, characterized in 
that PTFE in fibre form is used. 
Process according to Claim 1, characterized in 
that the material in sheet form is manufactured continuously 

by driving a band of expanded metal (2) and at 
least one PTFE tape (1, 3) stacked together in order to 

pass in succession through a set of calendering rolls and 
through an oven. 
Material in sheet form having a low coefficient 
of friction, characterized in that it is obtained by 

implementing the process according to any one of Claims 
1 to 6.  

 
Door hinge for a motor vehicle, characterized in 
that it includes an internal coating consisting of a 

sheet of the material according to Claim 7.
