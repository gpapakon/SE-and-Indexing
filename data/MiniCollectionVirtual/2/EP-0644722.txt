<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates generally to agents for the
prevention of dental calculus, commonly called tartar, that
are added to commercially-prepared diets for domestic
animals, and more particularly to novel agents for the
prevention of dental calculus in domestic animals that are
added as a coating to commercially-prepared diets for
domestic animals, especially dogs and cats, and that produce
significantly superior results.Dental calculus, or tartar, is recognized as a recurring
calcified deposit on the surfaces of the teeth of domestic
animals, including dogs and cats, as well as humans. It is
generally recognized that dental calculus develops in a
sequential process that involves the accumulation of dental
plaque and the subsequent calcification of the plaque by
saliva, which has very high concentrations of calcium and
phosphate. Although calculus, per se, is not directly
responsible for the development of oral diseases, it is
recognized as a secondary, or contributing, factor in the
development of periodontal disease because: (1) its presence
on the teeth serves as a local irritant to the adjacent soft
tissues, eliciting an inflammatory response (and soft tissue
inflammation is the initial phase of periodontal disease); 
(2) it interferes with the normal cleansing of the tooth
surfaces, which occurs during the mastication of food or
through the performance of conventional oral hygiene
procedures, such as toothbrushing and flossing; and (3) it
harbors bacterial toxins, which exacerbate periodontal
disease formation, by virtue of its porosity. Once formed,
calculus deposits can only be removed through concerted
mechanical procedures, i.e., a dental prophylaxis. Thus, the
prevention of dental calculus is of importance not only for
cosmetic reasons, but also because of dental calculus'
secondary role in the development of periodontal disease, and
the resultant systemic infections, alveolar bone recession,
tooth loss and adverse mouth/breath odors.At present, the recognized approaches for the prevention
of dental calculus formation are: (1) the meticulous, daily
removal of dental plaque prior to its calcification; and (2)
the daily application of crystal growth inhibitors that
interfere with the calcification of dental plaque by saliva.
Known crystal growth inhibitors include various soluble
pyrophosphates, sodium tripolyphosphate, soluble
diphosphonates, and certain soluble zinc compounds, such as
zinc chloride. These crystal growth inhibitors are currently
being used in dentifrices and mouthwashes for

<CLAIMS>
Use of sodium hexametaphosphate for the manufacture of
a dry animal food for preventing and/or reducing dental

calculus build-up, deposits and/or formation on the teeth of
dental calculus forming animals, the dry animal food

having a surface coating that
contains at least about 0.5% to about 3.0% by weight of the

dry animal food of sodium hexametaphosphate, in a regular
feeding regimen.

calculus forming animals are dogs.
The use as claimed in claim 1 wherein said dry animal
food is a dry dog food.
The use as claimed in claim 1 wherein said dental
calculus forming animals are cats.
