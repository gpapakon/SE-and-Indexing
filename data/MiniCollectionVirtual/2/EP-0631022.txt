<ABSTRACT>
The invention discloses a free-standing carcass unit or system-built structural unit, as three-dimensional body for constructing single-storey or multiple-storey building structures from a multiplicity of such three-dimensional bodies, each three-dimensional body being made up to prefabricated compound elements which each form a two-hinged frame in the longitudinal direction and a three-hinged frame in the transverse direction. The three-hinged frame can be transferred into a two-hinged frame by positive or frictional locking. Advantageously, the two prefabricated compound elements are produced together from concrete in such a manner that, after their manufacture, they can be separated for transportation and/or for storage, can be connected once again on site for constructing the building structure, and can be separated once again for dismantling the building structure in order then, if appropriate, to be used in a corresponding manner for constructing another building structure.

Tridimensional element as an unfinished or finished construction element
for assembling buildings made of a multiplicity of such construction

elements in at least one plane,

characterised in that

the construction element is composed of two precast construction units
(1, 2) which form respectively a two-legged frame in a longitudinal

direction and the assembled precast construction units form a three-legged
frame in the transverse direction prior to securing, which three-legged

frame is converted after securing of the precast construction units
into a two-legged frame,
the assembled precast construction units have bearers which extend
transversely between supports and in which bearers the formwork

recesses (R) are integral,
the formwork recesses in the end faces, forming the abutting faces, of the
precast construction units abut in pairs against each other,
ends (B1, B2) of two-sided reinforcements (92, 93; 94, 95) of the precast

construction units open out into the formwork recesses and
the reinforcement ends are connected to each other in a force-locking
manner.
Tridimensional element according to claim 1, characterised in that the
reinforcement ends of two reinforcements which are in alignment with each

other, said reinforcement ends being provided with threads, are connected
together by means of a threaded screw. 
Tridimensional element according to claim 1 or 2, characterised in that the
formwork recesses are in common filled with concrete.
Tridimensional element according to claim 1, characterised in that the
formwork recesses are formed by expendable formwork boxes (90a; 90b).
Tridimensional element according to one of the claims 1 to 3, characterised
in that both precast construction units of a precast construction element

have expendable, trapezoidal peel-off elements (106, 107) on their end faces
which form abutting faces, which elements (106, 107) engage centrally into

each other after securing of the precast construction units.
Method for producing a tridimensional element according to one of the
present claims, characterised in that the pre-fabricated supports of the two

precast construction units of a construction element are inserted into a
formwork device which has a common formwork table for the two cover

portions of the precast construction units and in that a flat formwork
separating element (91) is placed in the formwork table in order to separate

the cover portions.
Method for producing a tridimensional element according to one or more of
the present claims, characterised in that the two-sided reinforcements (92,

93; 94, 95) and the formwork separating element (91) are introduced firstly
into the common formwork device for the two precast construction units to

be produced, in that oppositely situated reinforcement ends (94, 95) of the
precast construction units are connected together in a force-locking

manner, m that the formwork device is then supplied with concrete for the
common production of the precast construction units, the connections of

the reinforcements remaining recessed, in that the set precast construction
units, which are separated from each other by the common formwork

separating element (91), are separated from each other by detaching the
connections and in that in situ on the building site the precast construction 

units which were produced together are assembled again and the
reinforcements are connected together once again.
Method according to claim 7, characterised in that the recesses for the
connections are filled with concrete after the final assembly of the precast

construction units.
Method according to claim 7 and 8, characterised in that the recesses are
formed by expendable formwork boxes which are introduced into the

common formwork device together with the reinforcements for the two
preeast construction units such that two formwork boxes respectively are

situated in pairs opposite each other in the separation plane of the precast
construction units and reinforcement ends of the precast construction units

open out into the formwork boxes where they can be connected to each
other.
