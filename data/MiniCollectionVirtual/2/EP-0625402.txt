<CLAIMS>
Soldering suspension for applying thin layers of 
solder to substrates, consisting of from 30 to 90 wt.% 

of soldering powder, from 0.1 to 20 wt.% of an organic 
binder, from 1 to 50 wt.% of an organic solvent and 

from 0 to 10 wt.% of a fluxing agent, wherein the 
soldering powder has a particle size of from 5 to 

50 µm and the ratio of the average particle size of 
the soldering powder, measured in µm, to the density 

of the soldering powder, measured in g/cm
3
, is between 
0.1 and 20,
 
characterised in that the soldering powder has a 

particle-size distribution wherein 55 to 70% of the 
particles are smaller than the particle size at the 

maximum of the particle-size distribution curve. 
Soldering suspension according to claim 1,
 
characterised in that the particle size is between 5 

and 30 µm, 60 to 65% of the particles being smaller 
than the particle size at the maximum of the particle-size 

distribution curve. 
Soldering suspension according to claim 1 or 2,
 
characterised in that the ratio of the average 

particle size of the soldering powder to the density 
of the soldering powder in the case of nickel solders 

and copper solders is between 0.1 and 5 [µm·g
-1
·cm
3
] 

and in the case of aluminium solders is between 2 and 
17 [µm·g
-1
·cm
3
]. 
Soldering suspension according to one of the preceding 
claims,
 
characterised in that the soldering suspension 

contains in addition titanium powder or zirconium 
powder.
