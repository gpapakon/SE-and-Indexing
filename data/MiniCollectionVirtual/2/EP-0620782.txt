<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to methods and apparatuses
for attaching objects such as sprouts to objects such as
planar portions of articles. More particularly, the present
invention relates to methods of and apparatuses for attaching
spouts to gable tops of paperboard cartons.Various apparatuses which form and fill gable top
paperboard cartons are known in the prior art. For example,
the Cherry-Burrell packaging machine, Model H-75, is a
standard in the field. The Cherry-Burrell machine forms a
paperboard carton having four sides and a bottom, partially
folds the upper ends of the sides of the carton into a gable
top, fills the carton, and completely folds and seals the
gable top. The Cherry-Burrell machine operates continuously
in an assembly line-type manner, such that cartons are formed
and filled one by one in the machine at sequential stations,
each of which performs a small task on the carton in under
one second, before the carton moves on to the next station.
The Cherry-Burrell machine is mentioned as an example only.
Other manufacturers also provide form and fill machines which
could be utilized to form a carton with a gable top.Gable top cartons of this type, though, have
disadvantages when they are used to store and dispense liquid
products such as milk, juice, etc. Specifically, the gable
top can often be difficult to open correctly without
accidentally tearing the carton, and, when the top is
reclosed, it fails to provide a liquid-tight closure and thus
allows spillage or the liquid if the carton is shaken or
accidentally tipped over.Accordingly, it has become desirable to place a
resealable closure on a sloping side of the gable top as a 
substitute for opening the gable top, wherein the closure is
more easily opened and is liquid-tight when reclosed. For
example, U.S. Patent No. 4,669,640 to Ando et al. discloses a
method of attaching a mouthpiece 34 to a gable top carton 20,
wherein the mouthpiece is pushed through an aperture 32 in a
sloping side 28 of the gable top carton 20 such that the
mouthpiece 34 is held to the side 28 by a flange 46 and
retainer lugs 48 of the mouthpiece 34, and wherein the flange
46 is then thermally or ultrasonically fused to the side 28.U.S. Patent No. 4,813,578 to Gordon et al. also
discloses a method of attaching a pour spout 40 to a gable
top carton 10, wherein the spout 40 is first placed on the
open gable top such that a flange 46 overlies an opening 30
in the gable top, and wherein the flange 46 is then heated
and pressed into contact with the gable
