particular a driving beam change-over and flashing switch, 

including a switch housing (10), a manually pivotable switch 
lever (26) for the actuation of a switching device by which 

a first movable electric contact (56) is controllable and 
for the actuation of a second contact piece (75) by which a 

second movable electric contact (76) is controllable, 
wherein the switch lever is supported in a carrier (14) 

rotatable around a third axis (16), and wherein the switch 
lever is guided in a longitudinal aperture (41) and is 

pivotable about a second axis (31) that is essentially 
perpendicular to the third axis, thereby actuating the 

second contact (76), and wherein the switch lever, when 
abutting on a stop on the longitudinal aperture guide, is 

pivotable about a first axis, which lies on the level of the 
stop and is essentially parallel to the second axis, thereby 

actuating the first electric contact (56),
characterized
 in that one portion of the 
circumferential guide surface of the longitudinal aperture 

(41) in the switch lever (26) is limited by a limiting 
component (15
0, 154) inserted into the lever (26) in the 
abutment area on the longitudinal aperture (A1, 152), and in 

that a first cylindrical pin (27) anchored in the carrier 
(14) slides along the limiting component, while the switch 

lever (26) pivots about the second axis (152). 
A steering column switch as claimed in claim 1,
characterized
 in that the limiting component 
(150, 154) is formed of a material of higher strength than  

 
that of the material of the lever (26) and preferably has a 

processed surface. 
A steering column switch as claimed in claim 2,
characterized
 in that the limiting component 
(150) is an essentially cuboid-shaped limiting plate 

inserted into the lever in a preferably undetachable manner. 
A steering column switch as claimed in any one of the 
preceding claims,
characterized
 in that the limiting component 
(154) is a second cylindrical pin which, extending parallel 

to the axis of the first cylindrical pin (27), is fastened 
to the lever (26). 
A steering column switch as claimed in any one of claims 1 
through 4,
characterized
 in that, in a manner known per 
se, the lever (26) is resiliently prestressed along the 

direction of the connecting line between the second axis 
(152) and the longitudinal aperture (41), and in that, under 

the prestress of the spring, the limiting component (150, 
154) slides along the first cylindrical pin (27) during the 

guidance of the lever (26) in the longitudinal aperture 
(41). 
A steering column switch as claimed in claim 4 or in claim 
5,
characterized
 in that the first cylindrical pin 
(27) and the second cylindrical pin (154) are formed by 

circular cylinders having approximately the same diameter.  
 
A steering column switch as claimed in claim 6,
characterized
 in that the curvature of the 
guiding surface of the limiting component (154) is larger 

than the curvature of the following guiding sections of the 
longitudinal aperture (41). 
A steering column switch as claimed in any one of the 
preceding claims,
characterized
 in that the limiting component 
(150, 154) is arranged symmetrically with respect to the 

longitudinal aperture. 
A steering column switch as claimed in any one of the 
preceding claims,
characterized
 in that, with respect to the 
connecting line between the second axis (152) and the 

longitudinal aperture (41), the longitudinal aperture (41) 
is inclined so as to point preferably towards the first 

switch contact (75). 
A steering column switch as claimed in any one of the 
preceding claims,
characterized
 in that the longitudinal aperture 
extends alongside a circle around the second axis (152), and 

parts of the contour follow a circle described around the 
axis (160) of the second cylinder (154). 
A steering column switch as claimed in any one of the 
preceding claims,
characterized
 in that the lever, under  
 

resilient prestress, adopts one of two stable end positions 
at a time, with the first end position corresponding to a 

turned-on lower beam and with the second end position 
corresponding to a turned-on upper beam. 
A steering column switch as claimed in claim 11,
characterized
 in that, upon a movement of the 
lever beyond the end position defining the lower beam, the 

lever pivots about the appertaining stop, thus operating 
the flashing function. 
A steering column switch as claimed in claim 1,
characterized
 in that the longitudinal 
aperture (41) extends from the point of support of the axis 

generally in the direction of the second contact piece 
(75). 
A steering column switch as claimed in claim 13,
characterized
 in that the pivot axis (28) is 
formed by a bolt (27) which, in the rest position of the 

lever (26), is situated at that end of the longitudinal 
aperture (41) which is remote from the second contact piece 

(75). 
A steering column switch as claimed in claim 13 or in claim 
14,
characterized
 in that the lever (26) at least 
has two switching steps, with the second contact piece (75) 

being operated in the first switching step and with the 
first contact piece (48) being operated in the second 

switching step.  
 
A steering column switch as claimed in any one of the 
preceding claims,
characterized
 in that the lever (26) extends

piece (75) and/or the second movable contact (76) 

essentially are aligned transversely to the lever (26), and 
in that the second contact piece (75) and/or the second 

movable contact (75) are located near the wall of the 
switch housing (10) through which the lever (26) passes, 

and in that the first contact piece (48) and the change-over 
device are arranged at a distance with regard to the 

second contact piece. 
A steering column switch as claimed in claim 16,
characterized
 in that the slide (44) of the 
change-over device is coupled with a lever (26) through a 

penetration (42) in the carrier (14), and in that the 
second movable contact (76) and/or the second contact piece 

(75) is located between a bearing bridge (13) of the 
carrier (14) and a base plate (12) carrying fixed electric 

contacts (57, 59, 60, 78, 80). 
A steering column switch as claimed in any one of the 
preceding claims,
characterized
 in that the carrier (14) has a 
cavity (25) essentially flaring outwards and accommodating 

the lever (20).  
 
A steering column switch as claimed in any one of the 
preceding claims,
characterized
 in that there is a pressure 
point, which can be felt, between the pivoting movement of 

the lever (26) for actuating one of the contact pieces (48
