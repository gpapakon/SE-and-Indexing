<ABSTRACT>
Imaging elements, such as photographic, 
electrostatographic and thermal imaging elements, are 

comprised of a support, an image-forming layer and an 
electrically-conductive layer comprising a film-forming 

hydrophilic colloid having dispersed therein both 
electrically-conductive metal-containing particles and 

water-insoluble polymer particles. The combination of 
hydrophilic colloid, metal-containing particles and 

water-insoluble polymer particles provides a controlled 
degree of electrical conductivity and beneficial 

chemical, physical and optical properties which adapt 
the electrically-conductive layer for such purposes as 

providing protection against static or serving as an 
electrode which takes part in an image-forming process.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates in general to imaging
elements, such as photographic, electrostatographic and
thermal imaging elements, and in particular to imaging
elements comprising a support, an image-forming layer
and an electrically-conductive layer. More
specifically, this invention relates to electrically-conductive
layers containing water-insoluble polymer
particles and to the use of such electrically-conductive
layers in imaging elements for such purposes
as providing protection against the generation of
static electrical charges or serving as an electrode
which takes part in an image-forming process.Problems associated with the formation and
discharge of electrostatic charge during the
manufacture and utilization of photographic film and
paper have been recognized for many years by the
photographic industry. The accumulation of charge on
film or paper surfaces leads to the attraction of dust,
which can produce physical defects. The discharge of
accumulated charge during or after the application of
the sensitized emulsion layer(s) can produce irregular
fog patterns or "static marks" in the emulsion. The
severity of static problems has been exacerbated
greatly by increases in the sensitivity of new
emulsions, increases in coating machine speeds, and
increases in post-coating drying efficiency. The
charge generated during the coating process results
primarily from the tendency of webs of high dielectric
polymeric film base to charge during winding and
unwinding operations (unwinding static), during 
transport through the coating machines (transport
static), and during post-coating operations such as
slitting and spooling. Static charge can also be
generated during the use of the finished photographic
film product. In an automatic camera, the winding of
roll film out of and back into the film cassette,
especially in a low relative humidity environment, can
result in static charging. Similarly, high-speed
automated film processing can result in static charge
generation. Sheet films are especially subject to
static charging during removal from light-tight
packaging (e.g., x-ray films).It is generally known that electrostatic
charge can be dissipated effectively by incorporating
one or more electrically-conductive "antistatic" layers
into the film structure. Antistatic layers can be
applied to one or to both sides of the film base as
subbing layers either beneath or on the side opposite
to the light-sensitive silver halide emulsion layers.
An antistatic layer can alternatively be applied as an
outer coated
