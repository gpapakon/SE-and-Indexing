A method for preparing optionally 2-substituted 5-chloroimidazol-4-carbaldehydes
of the general formula



wherein R designates hydrogen, a linear or branched C
1
-C
6
 alkyl group, a linear or
branched C
1
-C
6
 alkenyl group, a cyclopropyl, cyclobutyl, cyclopentyl or
cyclohexyl group or a benzyl or phenyl group optionally substituted with C
1
-C
6

alkyl, halogen, nitro or amino, characterised in that, in the first stage, a glycine
ester hydrohalide of the general formula



wherein R
1
 designates an alkyl group and X designates a halogen atom, is reacted
with an imidic acid ester of the general formula



wherein R has the specified meaning and R
2
 designates an alkyl group, in the
presence of a base into the optionally 2-substituted 3,5-dihydroimidazol-4-one of

the general formula

 
wherein R has the specified meaning, and is further reacted into the final product

with phosphorus oxychloride or phosgene in the presence of
N,N-dimethylformamide.
The method according to claim 1, characterised in that the base used in the first
stage is an alkali hydroxide or an alkali alcoholate.
The method according to claims 1 or 2, characterised in that the reaction in the
first stage is carried out in a pH range between 7 and 12.
The method according to one of claims 1-3, characterised in that the reaction
participants of the first stage, glycine ester hydrohalide, imidic acid ester, and base,

are reacted in the stoichiometric molar ratio of 1:1:1.
The method according to one of claims 1-4, characterised in that the reaction
temperature in the first stage is between -20째C and 50째C.
The method according to one of claims 1-5, characterised in that the reaction
participants of the second stage, optionally 2-substituted 3,5-dihydroimidazol-4-one,

phosphorus oxychloride or phosgene, N,N-dimethylformamide are reacted
in a molar ratio of 1:1:1 to 1:5:5.
The method according to one of claims 1-6, characterised in that the reaction
temperature in the second stage is between 50째C and 130째C.
The method according to claim 1, characterised in that the optionally 2-substituted
3,5-dihydroimidazol-4-one of the general formula IV is not isolated in the course

of the method.
Optionally 2-substituted 3,5-dihydroimidazol-4-one of the general formula IV,
wherein R designates n-propyl, n-butyl, 2-butenyl or 3-butenyl.
