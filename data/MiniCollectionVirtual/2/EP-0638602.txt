(30a, 30b)
 has been found to 
demonstrate superior properties as a thermal ink-jet adhesive 

material in combination with resistor assemblies 
(10)
 
employed in thermal ink-jet printheads. This material evidences 

better adhesion for securing the orifice plate (
22
) 
to the barrier material (
24
) used to form the ink firing 
chambers (
26
) within the printhead and superior corrosion 
resistance to thermal ink-jet inks, compared to other coating 

materials.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to thermal ink-jet
printers, and, more particularly, to printheads incorporating
an improved orifice coating for securing the orifice
plate to the barrier material used to form the ink firing
chamber within the printhead.Thermal ink-jet printers offer a low cost, high quality,
and comparatively noise free option to other types of
printers commonly used with computers. Such printers employ
a resistor element in a chamber provided with an
egress for ink to enter from a plenum. The plenum is connected
to a reservoir for storing the ink. A plurality of
such resistor elements are arranged in a particular pattern,
called a primitive, in a printhead. Each resistor
element is associated with a nozzle in a nozzle plate,
through which ink is expelled toward a print medium. The
entire assembly of printhead and reservoir comprise an
ink-jet pen.In operation, each resistor element is connected via
a conductive trace to a microprocessor, where current carrying
signals cause one or more selected elements to heat
up. The heating creates a bubble of ink in the chamber,
which is expelled through the nozzle toward the print medium.
In this way, firing of a plurality of such resistor 
elements in a particular order in a given primitive forms alphanumeric characters, performs
area fill, and provides other print capabilities on the medium.The present construction of printheads in thermal ink-jet print cartridges employs
nickel as the orifice plate material. Since inks corrode nickel, a gold layer (electroplated
gold) is formed on the surface of the nickel as a corrosion barrier. The orifice plate is
bonded to the barrier layer by a thermal cure cycle.Problems also exist with the use of adhesives for securing the orifice plate.
Adhesives do not provide a uniform coating and often cover the holes in the orifice plate.A need remains for a material useful in the construction of thermal ink-jet
printheads as an orifice coating which improves the securing of the orifice plate to the
barrier material, improves corrosion resistance, and eliminates costly gold plating.The present invention provides an improved method of making thermal ink-jet
printheads as defined in claim 1, and improved thermal ink-jet printheads as defined in
claim 10 of the accompanying claims.In accordance with the invention, a poly-p-xylylene coating has been found to
demonstrate superior properties as a thermal ink-jet orifice coating material to improve
securing the orifice plate to the barrier material in combination with
