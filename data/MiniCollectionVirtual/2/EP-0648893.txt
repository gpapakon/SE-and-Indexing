<ABSTRACT>
A process for finishing a paper web (1) provides that the web is subjected to a pressure treatment in at least one roll nip (8) and subsequently to a drying, whereupon there follows at least one further pressure treatment in a roll nip (8b). A device for carrying out this process has at least two roll nips (8), formed by means of rolls (6, 7), and a drying device (4). The latter is arranged in the run of the paper web (1) between two roll nips (8a, 8b). In this way, the smoothness of the paper can be improved or a paper of low compression can be achieved.

Process for finishing a paper web with a high incoming 
moisture content subjected to pressure treatment in a 

plurality of nips and to drying outside a nip, 
characterised in that drying is carried out between two 

nips once the paper web has passed through the nips so that 
at least one pressure treatment in a nip follows the drying 

process, and that drying is effected to close to the 
desired final moisture value. 
Process according to claim 1, characterised in that the 
subsequent pressure treatment is effected in only one nip. 
Process according to claim 1 or claim 2, characterised in 
that drying can be controlled in zones over the width of 

the web. 
Process according to one of claims 1 to 3, characterised in 
that properties of the finished web, such as moisture 

content, gloss and/or smoothness are measured and drying is 
effected as a function thereof. 
Process according to one of claims 1 to 4, characterised in 
that the steam produced during drying is exhausted. 
Process according to one of claims 1 to 5, characterised in 
that drying is effected by means of radiation, convection 

or thermal conduction. 
Apparatus for carrying out the process according to one of  
 

claims 1 to 6, comprising a vertical roll stack with a 
plurality of nips (8) formed between the rolls (6, 7) and a 

drying apparatus (4), characterised in that the drying 
apparatus (4) is arranged on the lower stack end between 

two nips (8a, 8b) as the paper web (1) moves from the top 
to the bottom. 
Apparatus according to claim 7, characterised in that the 
drying apparatus (4) has individual drying elements (16) 

distributed over the width of the web, the drying rate of 
which can be controlled independently of one another. 
Apparatus according to claim 7 or claim 8, characterised by 
at least one sensor (11) for measuring a web property, such 

as moisture content, gloss and/or smoothness, arranged 
behind the last nip (8b) in the course of the paper web 

(1), and by a control apparatus (13) which controls the 
drying rate as a function of the measured values. 
Apparatus according to one of claims 7 to 9, characterised 
in that a steam-exhausting apparatus (17) is associated 

with the drying apparatus (4). 
Apparatus according to one of claims 7 to 10, characterised 
in that the drying apparatus (4) is provided between the 

second lowest (8a) and the lowermost (8b) nip in the course 
of the paper web (1). 
Apparatus according to claim 11, characterised in that the 
drying apparatus (4) is arranged level with the second 

lowest nip (8a) and the paper web (1) is guided to the 
lowermost nip (8b) following deflection below the drying  

 
apparatus.
