<ABSTRACT>
A surface electrode (316) on a surface (330) of a 
LED has a pad (318), and further, at least first-order 

branches (319a, ..., 319d) linearly extending from the pad 
(318), second-order branches (320a, 320b, and 320c) 

diverged and linearly extending from the first-order 
branches (319a, ..., 319d), and third-order branches (322a, 

322b, and 322c) diverged and linearly extending from the 
second-order branches (320a, 320b, and 320c). The pad 

(318) out of the surface electrode (316) is not in 
electrical contact with a underlying semiconductor layer 

(331), whereas the surface electrode (316) and the 
semiconductor layer (331) are in electrical contact with 

each other at ends of the highest-order branches (322a, 
322b, and 322c). Also, the semiconductor layer is provided 

along a pattern of the surface electrode in a mesa shape. 
Thus, ineffective light emission underneath the surface 

electrode (316) is relatively reduced so that external 
quantum efficiency can be improved, and moreover even 

shorter-wavelength light can be allowed to go out at high 
efficiency by omitting a current diffusion layer.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a light-emitting
diode (LED) for use of display or the like.In recent years, there have been developed light-emitting
diodes (LEDs) that emit yellow or green light
using aluminium gallium indium phosphide (AlGaInP) series
materials, besides those using gallium arsenide phosphide
(GaAsP) series or gallium phosphide (GaP) series materials.A prior-art AlGaInP series LED is fabricated in
the following way. First, as shown in Fig. 1 which is a
sectional view of the LED, on a surface of an n-type GaAs
substrate 90 are stacked over all an n-type AlGaInP clad
layer 91, an undoped AlGaInP light-emitting layer 92, a p-type
AlGaInP clad layer 93, a p-type AlGaAs current
diffusion layer 94, a p-type GaAs contact layer 95, and a
p-side surface electrode 96. Next, as shown in Fig. 2
which is a plan view showing the LED, this surface
electrode 96 and the p-type GaAs layer 95 are patterned by
removing part of them. As a result, the surface electrode 
96 is composed of a circular pad 98 for performing wire-bonding,
and branches 99a, 99b, 99c, and 99d linearly
extending from the pad 98 in four directions. By providing
a plurality of branches 99a, 99b, 99c, and 99d in this way,
it is arranged that electrical current is diffused within a
LED chip as uniformly as possible. Thereafter, an n-side
rear-face electrode 97 is formed on the rear face of the
substrate 90. Light emitted from the light-emitting layer
92, being absorbed into the substrate 90 and the surface
electrode 96, goes out of the chip through a region 100a of
a chip surface 100 resulting from partially removing the
surface electrode 96 and through a side face 101.It should be noted that this LED is of double-hetero
structure in which the light-emitting layer 92 is
sandwiched by the two clad layers 91 and 93 greater in
bandgap than the light-emitting layer 92. With this
structure, to attain an effective confinement of electrons
and holes into the light-emitting layer 92 by the clad
layers 91 and 93, the Al composition ratio y is required to
be increased to as much as 0.7 to 1 in the composition
(AlyGa1-y)0.5In0.5P of the clad layers 91 and 93. However, if
the Al composition ratio y is increased to such a value,
doping a p-type or n-type element into the clad layers 91
and 93 becomes difficult so that the specific resistance of
the clad layers 91 and 93 becomes difficult to lower. 
Therefore, in this LED, the current diffusion layer 94 is
provided to prevent the current from concentrating
underneath the surface electrode 96,
