<ABSTRACT>
An object of the present invention is to improve the soot and dust collection efficiency by preventing the 
leakage of a dusty gas even when a high-temperature dusty gas is removed. The present invention relates to a dust 

removing apparatus in which a filter element (11) is held on a filter element mounting frame (12), characterized in 
that a flange (11a) is provided at the end portion of the filter element (11) which is on the side of a dusty gas (21) 

so that the portion of the flange (11a) which is on the side of a clean gas (22) is pressed against the portion of a 
flange (12a) of the filter mounting frame (12) which is on the side of the dusty gas via a packing (15) to prevent the 

leakage of the dusty gas (21). A plurality of honeycomb type filter elements of the above-described construction are 
put together and housed in a frame to form a honeycomb pack.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a dust removing
apparatus of combustion gas, coal gas and the like.Fig. 11 schematically illustrates a filter element used
heretofore as a dust removing apparatus of combustion gas and
gas produced by gasifying petrified fuel such as coal.
Referring to Fig. 11, a prior art is described by taking the
removal of soot dust contained in combustion exhaust gas as an
example.In Fig. 11, a pillar-shaped filter element 011 having a
substantially square section is accommodated in a filter
element mounting frame 012 made of metal or ceramics and both
ends of the elements are held by metal fittings 013. Further,
filling material 014 such as felt is filled into a gap between
the filter element 011 and the frame 012 to seal therebetween.Dirty gas 21 containing soot dust in combustion exhaust
gas is passed through the filter element 011 to be filtered
therein, so that soot dust in the exhaust gas is removed and 
purified gas 22 is discharged.As shown in Fig. 13, a plurality of the filter elements
are collected and are accommodated into an outer frame 023 to
be used as a pack.Further, Fig. 14 illustrates a conventional dust removing
apparatus using a honeycomb pack in which a unit number of
honeycomb type filter elements are collected to form a unit
lot. The apparatus includes thin paper-like seal packings 02
disposed on the side of dirty gas and on the side of purified
gas of filter elements 01 to hold the seal packings 02 between
contact surfaces of the filter elements 01. The seal packings
02 are wound on all of the filter elements 01 arranged into a
plurality of row and columns and all of the filter elements are
finally fastened by a honeycomb pack frame externally. As
shown in Fig. 15, the whole outer periphery of the filter
elements 01 is wound at inlet and outlet sides thereof by seal
packings 04 and is fastened by the honeycomb pack frame 03 to
effect sealing in the honeycomb pack frame 03.Fig. 16 schematically illustrates an order of assembling
such a honeycomb pack. More particularly, first of all, as
shown in Fig. 16(A), a honeycomb pack bottom frame 05 and a
center partition plate 06 are held by a jig 09. Then, as shown
in Fig. 16(B), the filter elements 01 each having the above
paper-like seal packings 02 which are previously wound on both
ends of the filter element are piled up. In this case, seal 
packings 04 are disposed on outer end portions of the bottom
partition plate 05 and the center partition plate 06.After the filter elements have been piled up completely,
seal
</DESCRIPTION>
<CLAIMS>
A dust removing apparatus comprising a honeycomb pack
(101) in which a plurality of filter elements (102) is

collected and accommodated to form a unit lot and dirty gas
(21) is converted into purified gas (22) by said filter

elements (102) mounted to a filter element mounting frame (103)
which is mounted to a honeycomb pack frame body (101a), each of said

filter elements (102) having disposed a
flange (112) on the dirty gas inlet
characterized in that

said filter elements (102) are made of porous ceramic substance
