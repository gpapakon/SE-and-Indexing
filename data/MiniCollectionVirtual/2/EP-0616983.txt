<ABSTRACT>
Flow channel 1 for moving molten glass from the glass production zone to the forming zone. The channel includes means for homogenising the glass 15, 16, 17, 18 and structure means 2, 40, the combination of these means avoiding the formation of a return glass stream.

Flow channel (1) comprising a canal (2) and a roof (7) used
in the manufacture of flat glass, for passage of the molten

glass from the glass melting area to the forming area, and
means of thermal conditioning (11; 15-18) of the glass, means

(15-18) of homogenising the glass, notably thermal
homogenisation means, and structure means such that a ratio of

the mean height to the mean width of the channel is less than
1, characterised in that the structure means are also a canal

(2) having a shape without abrupt change in cross-section such
as a step or neck abruptly reducing the cross-section of flow

of the glass, a floor (4) which is substantially flat or
horizontal over its entire extent and means (40) at the entry

to the channel delimiting an entry cross-section equal to the
exit cross-section of the channel, the combination of these

conditioning, homogenisation and structure means preventing the
formation of a return glass flow by limiting to low values the

temperature gradients between the different parts of a
transverse section of the glass flow.
Channel (1) according to Claim 1, characterised in that the
structure means are such that the ratio of the mean height to

the mean width of the channel is less than 0.5.
Channel (1) according to one of Claims 1 or 2,
characterised in that the means of homogenising the glass

comprise at least one stirrer (15, 16, 17, 18) driven in a
circular movement. 
Channel (1) according to Claim 3, characterised in that the
stirrer (15, 16, 17, 18) is disposed in the upstream part (12)

of the channel.
Channel (1) according to one of Claims 3 or 4,
characterised in that the active part (19) of the stirrer (15,

16, 17, 18) has a cylindrical external shape.
Channel (1) according to one of Claims 3 to 5,
characterised in that the stirrer (15, 16, 17, 18) has the

shape of a crank.
Channel (1) according to one of the preceding claims,
characterised in that the homogenisation means comprise at

least two stirrers (15, 16) disposed transversely and driven in
circular movements.
Channel (1) according to one of the preceding claims,
characterised in that the thermal conditioning means are chosen

from amongst burners (11) and coolers.
Channel (1) according to Claim 8, characterised in that the
coolers are stirrers (15, 16, 17, 18) used as homogenisation

means.
Channel (1) according to one of the preceding claims,
characterised in that its upstream part (12) is wider than its

downstream part (14) and in that it narrows evenly and
progressively.
Channel (1) according to one of the preceding claims,
characterised in that its floor (1) is provided with a drain

(26). 
Channel (1) according to Claim 11, characterised in that
the drain (26) is a transverse slot disposed in the downstream

part of the channel over the entire width of the canal (2) and
whose flow rate can preferably be regulated.
Channel (1) according to one of the preceding claims,
characterised in that the means delimiting the entry are a dam

intended to be partially or totally immersed in the molten
glass.
Channel (1) according to Claim 13, characterised in that
the dam is a heel (40) disposed on the floor (4).
Channel (1) according to Claim 14, characterised in that
the dam is movable.
Channel (1) according to one of the preceding claims,
characterised in that it is also provided with level-regulation

means (22).
Channel (1) according to Claim 16, characterised in that
the level-regulation means are at least an overflow spout (22).
Channel (1) according to Claim 17, characterised in that
the overflow spout (22) is disposed in the downstream part (4)

of the channel.
Channel (1) according to one of Claims 17 or 18,
characterised in that the overflow spout (22) is formed by two

branches (20, 21) disposed on each side of the channel. 
Channel (1) according to Claim 19, characterised in that
the two branches (20, 21) are perpendicular to the channel.
Device for feeding a machine for forming flat glass,
notably a tin bath, with a molten glass, comprising a

compartment for melting the glass and a channel (1) for
transferring the glass to the forming machine, characterised in

that the channel is a non-return channel according to one of
the preceding claims.
Device according to Claim 21, characterised in that the
channel (1) is disposed directly downstream of the compartment

for melting or separated by a simple conditioning compartment,
without any intermediate refining compartment.
Device according to Claim 22, characterised in that it
functions at higher melting temperatures than the temperatures

normally used for the same glass composition, notably at
approximately 1550Â°C for a soda-lime-silica glass.
Method for the direct passage of the molten glass from the
glass melting area to the forming area, characterised in that

the molten glass flows in the flow channel according to one of
Claims 1 to 20 disposed between these two areas, being

conditioned and homogenised without any return flow.
Use of the channel (1) according to one of Claims 1 to 20

Use of the channel (1) according to Claim 25 for feeding a
tin bath with molten glass produced by electric melting. 
Use of the channel (1) according to Claim 25 or 26,
characterised in that the glass is a glass with a dark or very

dark colour.
