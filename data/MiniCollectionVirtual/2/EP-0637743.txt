<ABSTRACT>
A method for allowing authentification of a bulk liquid 
e.g. petrol or another mineral oil based product, comprises 

introducing into the liquid a small amount of a 
chemiluminescent substance. Samples for authentification 

are subjected to the conditions required to trigger the 
chemiluminescent reaction and monitored for chemilumin
escent 
emission.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a method for monitoring the
levels of chemical marker compounds.
The invention is particularly, but
not exclusively, directed towards the detection of added
chemicals in liquid products, especially in oil based
products such as petroleum.Chemical additives are important constituents of oil
based products such as petroleum, diesel oil and lubricating
oils. The additives are generally designed to impart
favourable and occasionally unique properties to the product
such that their absence or a reduction in their
concentration may result in a significant loss of
performance. These additives are normally introduced at a
central distribution point into products which may be
distributed on a world wide basis. Since product performance
is dependent on the presence of appropriate levels of the
additives in the final product as it is retailed, a system
for demonstrating their presence at any point in the
distribution chain is required.A second, but equally important consideration, relates
to the problem of counterfeiting. Products which are
perceived to have favourable properties over rival products
will be imitated for reasons of commercial gain. They may
not, for example, enjoy the benefits of the correct
additives but may be sold as to imitate visually the better
product. In such a situation, the ability to distinguish the 
genuine product from imitations is highly desirable.Accurate identification of oil based products is also
important since litigation can be brought as a consequence
of accidents and spillages. In these situations, the
presence of a marker substance which can identify or
alternatively exclude a particular manufacturer or
distributor can be of extreme value.In summary, the presence of readily identifiable marker
substances in oil based products could contribute
significantly to several aspects of quality assurance in the
oil and petroleum industry. Up to now, it appears that no
simple procedure has yet been devised to provide such a
system.Fuel additives are frequently beneficial to the
performance of the product at extremely low concentrations.
However, their incorporation into fuels at such low
concentrations means that they are not readily detected by
conventional analytical procedures. Even in situations where
the additive can be detected by sophisticated
physical/chemical techniques, there is the problem that
samples must be taken to a central laboratory for analysis
which may be tedious and time consuming.One recent approach has been to make use of the fact
that

<CLAIMS>
A method for authenticating a bulk liquid, which
comprises introducing into said bulk liquid a

chemiluminescent substance capable of taking part in a
chemiluminescent reaction, withdrawing a sample of said

bulk liquid to be authenticated, exposing said sample to
the conditions required to trigger a chemiluminescent

reaction, and authenticating said bulk liquid based on
whether said chemiluminescent reaction occurs.
A method according to Claim 1, for authenticating
said bulk liquid by reference to the extent of dilution

thereof, wherein said introducing step comprises
introducing into said undiluted bulk liquid a known amount

of a chemiluminescent substance, and said authentication
step comprises monitoring the characteristics of said

chemiluminescent reaction and comparing said
characteristics with those of the chemiluminescent reaction

in the undiluted bulk liquid, thereby to determine the
extent of dilution of said bulk liquid.
A method according to Claim 1, for authenticating
said bulk liquid by determining the presence or amount of

an additive or mixture of additives therein, wherein the
amount of said chemiluminescent substance introduced into

the bulk liquid is related to the amount of said additive
or mixture of additives.
A method according to Claim 3, wherein said
chemiluminescent marker substance is introduced into said 

bulk liquid with said additive or mixture of additives.
A method according to any preceding of the claims,
wherein said bulk liquid is a mineral oil based product.
A method according to Claim 5, wherein said
product is selected from the group comprising petroleum,

diesel oil and lubricating oils.
A method according to any preceding claim, wherein
said chemiluminescent marker substance is an acridinium

compound capable of undergoing a chemiluminescent reaction
and of the general formula:-



wherein R
1
 is a moiety capable of being part of a quaternary
nitrogen centre,

   R
2
 and R
3
 may be the same as R
1
 or a hydroxyl, carboxyl,
amino, substituted amino or halide group,

   R
4
 is a moiety whose chemical reactivity permits the
compound to undergo a chemiluminescent reaction, and X
-
 is an
anion.
A method according to any preceding claim, wherein
said chemiluminescent marker substance is substantially

insoluble in water.
A method according to any of the preceding Claims,
wherein said chemiluminescent substance is present in said 

bulk liquid in an amount between 0.001 ng/µl and 10 ng/µl.
A method according to any of the preceding
Claims, wherein said chemiluminescent substance is

immunologically unbound in normal use of said bulk liquid.
