<ABSTRACT>
With a slatted bed base (1) having side members (2) which may or may not be pivotably mounted and bed slats (4) mounted in fitting parts (3), an economically acceptable, constructionally simple solution is to be provided which enables an elastic, individual movement of a plurality of combined fitting parts independently of the elasticity of the individual fitting parts. This is achieved in that the resiliently mounted side-member regions (5) are arranged on the side members (2) so as to be liftable and lowerable by means of least two spring elements (6).

Slat grid (1) with pivotably mounted side cheeks (2) and with bed slats (4) 
mounted in fittings (3), the side cheeks (2) having zones (5) with at least two fittings (3) 

for bed slats (4) adjacent to one another, mounted elastically in relation to the other side 
cheeks, the side cheek zones (5), by means of at least two spring elements (6), being 

mounted so that they can be raised and lowered on the side cheeks (2), characterised in 
that the elastically mounted side cheek zones (5) are constructed as sections at least partly 

extending over the side cheek, with section zone which extends over the respective side 

cheek (2) and of which the lower side (9), facing towards the side cheek, forms a contact 
surface for the spring elements (6). 
Slat grid in accordance with Claim 1, characterised in that the side cheek (2) is 
notched, at least in a certain zone, the notched zone (2a) of the side cheek being covered 

by the spring-mounted section (5). 
Slat grid in accordance with one of the foregoing claims, characterised in that the 
elastic section (5) is constructed as a hollow section open at the bottom and extending 

over the notched part (2a) of the side cheek (2). 
Slat grid in accordance with one of the foregoing claims, characterised in that the 
spring elements (6) used consist of spiral springs (6a) mounted on rams (11) passing down 

through the side cheeks (2). 
Slat grid in accordance with Claim 4, characterised in that some of the spiral 
springs (6a) are positioned in blind borings (10) in the notched zone (2a) of the side cheek 

(2). 
Slat grid in accordance with Claim 3 or one of the foregoing claims, 
characterised in that the spring elements (6) are formed by tubular springs (6b) and/or by 

pneumatic cushions of which the internal pressure is adjustable from the outside. 
Slat grid in accordance with one of the foregoing claims, characterised in that the 
side cheek zones (5) take the form of plastic elements with mounting pins (13) or 

receiving shoes (13') shaped onto them in one piece and serving for the bottom zones of 
the fittings (3) and/or of the bed slats (4).
