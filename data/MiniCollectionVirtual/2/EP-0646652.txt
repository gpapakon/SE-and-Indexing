<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a steel plant with a closed tiltable arc furnace (19) for smelting scrap. The furnace comprises a bottom part (14) and a top part (12) connected to an extraction device. The said top part is closed off by a furnace lid (23). Also provided is a closable charging device (20), the essential features of which are that it comprises at least two storage containers (21, 22), which are connected at the top to the extraction device and, at the foot, have gas-permeable bottoms (81, 82) which can be opened. An annular component (31-39) which compensates in a gastight manner for the change in position relative to the storage containers (21, 22) caused by the tilting movement is provided between the storage containers and the bottom part (11).

<CLAIMS>
A steel-making apparatus with a closed tiltable 
arc furnace for smelting scrap, consisting of a lower 

vessel part lined with refractory material and an upper 
vessel part connected to an extraction means, which 

furnace is closed off by a furnace roof and which has a 
closable charging device, through which in a steelworks 

hall charge brought in by means of a transport means 
can be charged, and also an electrode fastened to a 

supporting device and projecting into the upper part of 
the vessel, wherein between storage containers (21, 22) 

and the lower part of the vessel (11) there is provided 
an annular component (30) extending substantially at 

right-angles to the central furnace axis (I),
 
characterised in that 


the charging device (20) has at least two storage 
containers (21, 22) which are connected at the top end 

beneath a closing means (26) to the extraction means 
(40), 
that the storage vessels (21, 22) have at the bottom 
end openable, gas-permeable bottoms (81, 82), 
that a holding device (53) fastened to a bearing (54) 
of the steelworks hall (50) is provided, to which the 

storage containers (21, 22) can be attached, and 
that the annular component (30) is designed as a 

compensation element (31), which compensates in 
gastight manner for the changes in position relative to 

the storage containers (21, 22) which are caused by the 
tilting movement at least of the lower vessel part 

(11). 
A steel-making apparatus according to Claim 1, 
characterised in that the annular component (30) is a 

compensation element (31) arranged between the furnace 
roof (23) and the mouth of the upper furnace part (12).  

 
A steel-making apparatus according to Claim 2, 
characterised in that the compensation element (31) is 

a heat-resistant, gastight cloth (32). 
A steel-making apparatus according to Claim 2, 
characterised in that the compensation element (31) is 

a metallic compensator (33). 
A steel-making apparatus according to Claim 4, 
characterised in that the compensation element (31) has 

an annular disc or sleeve fastened to the mouth of the 
upper vessel part (12), which disc or sleeve can be 

guided in a U-shaped annular sleeve (36) or annular 
disc (37) attached to the furnace roof (23). 
A steel-making apparatus according to Claim 5, 
characterised in that elastic sealing rings (38) are 

provided between the annular sleeve (36) and the disc 
or the annular disc (37) and the sleeve. 
A steel-making apparatus according to Claim 5, 
characterised in that the furnace roof (23) is divided 

into two and that each roof part (61, 62) is fastened 
to a pivoting means (60) designed as a hinge, in which 

it is possible to pivot the roof parts (61, 62) away 
horizontally. 
A steel-making apparatus according to Claim 7, 
characterised in that the separating line (63) of the 

two furnace roof parts (61, 62) extends substantially 
parallel to the electrode supporting arm (72) and the 

roof parts (61, 62) are arranged at the separating line 
(63) to overlap one another. 
A steel-making apparatus according to Claim 1, 
characterised in that the annular component (30) is a  

 
cup (39) arranged between the lower vessel part (11) 

and the upper vessel part (12). 
A steel-making apparatus according to Claim 1, 
characterised in that the openable bottom (81, 82) 

consists of prong-shaped toggle levers (83), the 
individual levers of which can be pivoted by means of 

drives (85), e.g. pneumatic piston-cylinder units. 
A steel-making apparatus according to Claim 1, 
characterised in that the holding device (53) has a 

bearing (54) which permits a tilting movement of the 
storage containers (21, 22) and the electrode 

supporting device (70) corresponding to the tilting 
movement of the furnace vessel (11, 12). 
A steel-making apparatus according to Claim 1, 
characterised in that the mouths (24, 25) of the 

storage containers (21, 22) at the top end have sealing 
lips (29), on to which a scrap basket (91) with a 

corresponding counter-lip (92) can be lowered. 
A steel-making apparatus according to one of the 
above claims, characterised in that the tilting 

movement of the furnace vessel (11, 12) is produced by 
piston-cylinder units (14-16) connected to the lower 

furnace vessel (11), with at least one unit (16) being 
arranged horizontally and three units (14-15) thereof 

being arranged vertically.
