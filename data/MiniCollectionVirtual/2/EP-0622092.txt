<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a thread wound
golf ball. More particularly, it relates to a thread wound
golf ball which is designed to provide low spin and
increased flying distance.Conventionally, well known thread wound golf balls,
comprise a core which is formed by winding highly expanded
rubber thread around a spherical liquid center and a cover
with dimples which is coated on the rubber thread layer and
which is subsequently press-formed into thread wound golf
balls. For the liquid center, a hollow section of the
hollow spherical center bag comprising rubber, etc. is filled
with a liquid containing water or a specific gravity adjusting
agent.The functions required for golf balls include
large flying distance and easy ball control. Thread
wound golf balls allow larger backspin and ensure better
controllability than two-piece solid golf balls, but have the
disadvantage of a shorter flying distance than two-piece
solid golf balls because the balls are blown up by backspin.In the present market, average golfers who want a
longer carry prefer two-piece solid golf balls which carry
well, whereas advanced and professional golfers with small
handicaps give more emphasis on controllability than flying
distance and generally prefer to use thread wound golf
balls (particularly balata-covered thread wound golf balls). In order to increase the control of two-piece
solid golf balls, development has been made to soften the
cover and to give the ball a spin like thread wound golf
balls. Development has also been made to increase the
flying distance of thread wound golf balls.However, because increasing the initial speed of
balls by increasing the impact resilience of rubber is
restricted by the initial-speed upper limit specified by
the golf ball specifications, an increase in flying
distance by increasing the initial speed has its own limit.Consequently, it is necessary to increase flying
distance bysome other means than increasing initial speed
by increasing rubber impact resilience, such as improving
liquid center construction.Therefore, the following description is made on
the techniques which have been proposed to date with
respect to the center of thread wound golf balls and those
which have been actually adopted.For the center of the thread wound golf ball,
liquid centers and solid centers are available.
Since the solid center is so-called rubber lump and is
easy to produce, it is proposed in Japanese Kokai
publication No. 48-4025 that the center diameter which is
conventionally in the range of 25 - 28
