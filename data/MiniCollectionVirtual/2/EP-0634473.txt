<ABSTRACT>
An electrorheological fluid composition wherein 
inorganic/organic composite particles comprising a core 1 

comprising organic polymeric compound and a shell 3 comprising 
inorganic microparticles 2 which are electrically semiconducting 

in a semiconducting region in which conductivity is within a 
range of 10³-10⁻¹¹ Ω⁻¹/cm at room temperature, are dispersed in 

an electrically insulating medium. These inorganic/organic 
composite particles are produced by means of a method in which 

the cores 1 and the shells 3 are simultaneously formed, and the 
surfaces thereof are preferably polished. An electrorheological 

fluid composition possessing electrorheological effects, having 
superior storage stability, capable of use over long periods, 

having little abrasiveness, which is not affected by 
environmental temperature or humidity, a current value of which 

is stable, and which has little power consumption.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an electrorheological
fluid composition which can be used, for example, in instruments
for braking or for power transmission, such as clutches,
dampers, shock absorbers, valves, actuators, vibrators,
printers, vibrating devices, or the like, and more specifically,
relates to an electrorheological fluid composition which stably
generates large resistance to shearing flow by means of the
application of an external electric field.Conventionally, compositions termed "electrorheological
fluids" (hereinbelow referred to as "ER fluids") are known.
These compositions are fluids which are obtained by dispersing
solid particles in a medium having electric insulation
properties, for example, and when an external electric field is
applied thereto, the viscosity thereof increases markedly, and
in certain cases, such a liquid may solidify; these are thus
fluid compositions possessing the so-called "electrorheological
effect" (hereinbelow referred to as the "ER effect").This type of ER effect is also termed a "Winslow effect";
the effect is thought to be produced by the polarization of the
solid particles dispersed in the electrically insulating medium
by means of the action of the electric field produced between
electrodes when voltage is applied to a composition disposed
between the electrodes, and by the alignment and bridging in the 
direction of the electric field by means of electrostatic
attraction based on this polarization, and the resistance to an
external shearing flow.ER fluids possess the ER effect described above, so that
they are expected to find applications in instruments for
braking or for power transmission operating by electrical
control, such as clutches, dampers, shock absorbers, valves,
actuators, vibrators, printers, vibrating devices, or the like.However, conventionally known ER fluids possessed various
problems.Conventionally, ER fluids were known in which solid
particles having surfaces which adsorbed and retained water,
such as silica gel particles, cellulose particles, starch
particles, casein particles, or polystyrene-type ion exchange
resin particles, or the like, were dispersed in electrically
insulating oils such as silicone oil, diphenyl chloride,
transformer oil, or the like; however, these possessed
insufficient resistance to external shearing flow during the
application of voltage (hereinbelow referred to as "the shearing
resistance"), and furthermore, required a high applied voltage,
had a large power consumption, and as a result of water
adsorption
