<ABSTRACT>
Combination of prefabricated, preferably 
pre-cast concrete stringers (12) and treads (13) which 

can be employed in any particular application to 
provide either a staircase of any required inclination, 

a horizontal walkway or a ramp of a required 
inclination. In all these applications the same 

standardised stringers (12) and treads (13) can be 
effectively used. Stanchions can be added as required. 

Further embodiments can be used for providing ladders 
and providing seating for grand stands or theatres.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention lies in the field of construction and one embodiment of the 
invention, for example, relates to a stringer and tread combination for use in the 
construction of a staircase, ramp or walkway. The scope of the invention 
extends to the stringer and the tread and to a method of establishing a staircase, 
ramp or a walkway. Another embodiment of invention, however, is also useful in creating seating 
structures, in particular which are applicable for the manufacture of grand 
stands or seating arrangement for theatres, both open air and indoor although 
primarily the former. The concept of the invention can be further extended to the application of 
creating ladders or very steep staircases or step ways. The steepest staircase 
allowed by official building regulations is inclined at approximately 40° to the 
horizontal and at angles of inclination greater than 40° the structure can 
conveniently be referred to either as a very steep staircase or preferably referred 
to as a ladder. This invention provides structural building components which may be precast 
and applied in all of these areas.  Staircases present many on-site problems for the builder. Floor-to-floor heights 
vary as do riser and tread dimensions. Typically, skilled carpenters set out and 
build the shuttering with extensive propping and specially designed reinforcing 
being required before the concrete is poured. Not only is space needed for 
storing reinforcing and shuttering material but concrete spills resulting from 
bleeding and kicking shuttering and careless barrow-handling add to the general 
mess and congestion in the very place where easy access to upper floors would 
enhance efficiency and project completion. Proposals for prefabricated staircases have been made and examples can be 
found in the French Patent 90 10433, Publication number 2665920 and United 
States Patent 3986579. The former patent describes a stringer and tread construction for a staircase in 
which the stringers have a substantially conventional stepped construction for 
supporting a tread on each step characterised by a radius of curvature on the 
upper surface of each step matched by a similar radius of curvature on the 
underneath of each tread by which only a very limited amount of adjustment of 
the tread so as to be perfectly level can be achieved. It is apparent from the 
drawings that the teaching of the French patent is confined to the idea that only 
limited adjustment of the treads for the purpose of levelling them is facilitated 
by the

<CLAIMS>
A stringer and tread combination in which the stringer is lengthwise 
provided with successive integrally formed scallops each of which has a 

lengthwise shape conforming to the arc of a circle each of which scallops 
can accommodate at least part of an underside of a tread which underside 

has a co-acting shape to that of the scallops and in which the scallops 
begin and end on the same longitudinal line of the stringer. 
A stringer and tread combination as claimed in claim 1, in which the 
combination comprises two opposed, spaced apart and generally parallel 

stringers each stringer on its inner side surface includes scallop shaped 
corbels for supporting the end portions of the treads. 
A stringer and tread combination as claimed in claim 1, in which the end 
portion of each stringer is provided with half a scallop so that two 

stringers having such end portions can be mated in an end to end 
configuration which will provide a full scallop. 
A stringer and tread combination as claimed in claim 3, provided also 
with a landing adapted to fill a gap between two sets of stringers and 

treads, the landing having mating half scallops on two of its edges. 
A stringer and tread combination as claimed in claim 1, in which each 
tread incorporates a riser which depends from the front underside of the 

tread. 
A stringer and tread combination as claimed in claim 1, for ladders, in 

which the scallop diameter is less than the pitch between treads and the 
arc of the scallops is close to a semi-circle and in which the centre on 

which the circular shape of each scallop is generated is in line with the 
upper edge of the stringer. 
A stringer and tread combination as claimed in claim 1, in which the end 
portion of each tread is adapted for mounting a stanchion. 
A stringer and tread combination as claimed in claim 7, provided in 
combination also with stanchions having handrail supports of bendable 

material allowing a handrail to adopt an angle equal to the angle of the 
staircase or walkway or ramp. 
Stringers for a stringer and tread combination as claimed in claim 1 
which stringer is lengthwise provided with successive integrally formed 

scallops each of which has a lengthwise shape conforming to the arc of a 
circle each of which scallops can accommodate at least part of an 

underside of a tread in which the scallops begin and end on the same 
longitudinal line of the stringer.
