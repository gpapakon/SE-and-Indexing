<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an aqueous ink. More particularly, the present invention relates to an aqueous ink
which, when used in recording, gives a high-quality recorded image having improved water resistance and a satisfactory
image density and prevented from suffering a bronzing phenomenon, which has been severe in recording with conventional
black inks.Most of the conventional inks are classified into pigment inks and dye inks. Pigment inks have been used in a
variety of fields because they are superior to dye inks in light resistance and water resistance and are capable of
forming satisfactory recorded images which suffer neither discoloration nor fading. However, the pigment inks at present
have the problem of poor ink stability. Specifically, the pigment tends to aggregate with the lapse of time, and this
aggregation causes clogging at a pen point or nozzle of an ink jet printer or causes precipitation during ink storage.On the other hand, dye inks are free from the aggregation and related problems. Hence, the dye inks are extensively
investigated and are also utilized in a variety of fields, for example, in non-impact recording methods, which have an
advantage of little printing noise. Exceedingly promising among such recording methods is ink-jet recording, by which
high-speed recording is possible and recording can be conducted on so-called plain paper without any special treatment
for fixation. Various techniques of ink-jet recording have been devised so far; some of these have come into commercial
use after being improved, while others are still in the stage of continuous efforts at practical use.Although either pigment inks or dye inks are usable as inks for such recording techniques, pigment inks have the
stability problem and the like problems described above. Hence, dyes are frequently used for avoiding such problems.
However, an ink containing a water-soluble dye is unsatisfactory in water resistance, although excellent in stability
during storage and ejection. Another problem of these inks is the so-called bronzing phenomenon in which a recorded
image formed by using a dye ink becomes light-reflective, as it dries, and comes to have a yellow to brown metallic
luster because of the deposition of dye crystals on the paper. Since the recorded image in which the bronzing phenomenon
is observed is light-reflective, the recorded image not only has a reduced density but also has a tone considerably
different from the desired one.A known technique for preventing the bronzing phenomenon is
