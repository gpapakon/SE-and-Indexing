<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a digestion shed with flexible guiding and conditioning of air streams. It is used, in particular, for large composting installations. The object of the invention is to permit energy-saving and environmentally friendly ventilation and venting of a digestion shed. This object is achieved in that a digestion shed is subdivided into sections for introduction, intensive zone and post-digestion. The sections for intensive digestion are separated from the other sections by flaps. Pressure ventilation takes place in the intensive zone and suction ventilation takes place in the post-digestion sections.

Digestion shed with flexible guiding and conditioning of 
airflows, having a ventilation system designed for pressure- or 

suction ventilation as well as a corresponding shed floor in the 
form of a gas-distributor plate for receiving the material to be 

rotted down in stack form, a transfer machine (16) for the 
material to be rotted down, heat exchangers (15) and biofilters 

(17), characterised in that the digestion shed is subdivided into 
panel areas (1-11) by means of horizontally and/or vertically 

pivotable or displaceable wall-like elements (12, 13), as a 
result of which the panel areas (2-4) of an intensive zone of the 

rotting process are separated by the wall-like elements from the 
panel areas (5-11) of secondary rotting as well as from the panel 

area (1) of the input of the material to be rotted down and are 
equipped in such a way that the ventilation in the panel areas 

(2-4) is effected as pressure ventilation and in the panel areas 
(5-11) as suction ventilation. 
Digestion shed according to claim 1, wherein the wall-like 
elements are pivotable flaps (12, 13). 
Digestion shed according to any of claims 1 or 2, wherein 
the pivoting of the wall-like elements is effected in a power-driven 

manner and is coupled to the feed motion of a transfer 
machine (16). 
Digestion shed according to claim 1, wherein the wall-like 
elements are louvres. 
Digestion shed according to claim 1 wherein the wall-like 
element between the panel areas (1) and (2) is firmly arranged 

in the roof area of the digestion shed and is of louvre-like 
design in the floor area of the digestion shed in order to 

permit a displacement of the transfer machine (16).  
 
Digestion shed according to claim 1, wherein the wall-like 
elements are horizontally displaceable.
