<ABSTRACT>
The invention provides for wireless local area network apparatus 
comprising a transmitter (20) and a receiver (48) in which operation of 

the receiver (48) is accurately synchronized with periodic signals (28) 
from the transmitter (20). The periodic signals (28) contain timing data 

indicating the state of a timer (22) in the transmitter (20) at the time the 
signal containing that data was transmitted and this timing data is 

retrieved from the signal (28) when received by the receiver (48) and 
loaded in a-timer (58) for controlling operation of the receiver.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to wireless local area network apparatus.A wireless local area network commonly comprises a plurality of
communication stations located in a Basic Service Area (BSA). The stations can send
and receive communication signals via a base station and, in this manner, the base
station receives the signals from a station in the BSA and re-transmits the signals to the
intended recipient station.The BSA can be provided as one of a plurality of BSAs which together
form an Extended Service Area. In this case the base station of each BSA may
comprise an access point for a backbone infrastructure for connecting the BSAs for
allowing communication between stations in different BSAs within the Extended
Service Area.Communication between stations, whether by way of a base station or
otherwise, can require synchronization between a transmitter of one station or an access
point and a receiver of another station. Disadvantageously, accurate synchronization
between a transmitter and a receiver in a
BSA cannot be readily achieved due, in
particular, to operational limitations such as transmission and reception delays and
delays in accessing the wireless medium.WO91/07030 discloses a wireless fast packet communications system. A
distributed synchronization method provides for the combination of both voice and data
in a single switch using a common packet structure.
To achieve frame synchronization between two communicating units, one unit transmits
a frame sync packet in each frame, said packet containing the "time-of-frame" that it
is transmitted; the other unit receives the frame, extracts the "time-of-frame",
compares it to a reception-time stamp, and adjusts synchronization accordingly. According to one aspect of the present invention there is provided a
wireless local area network apparatus, characterized in that said apparatus comprises:
transmitter means for periodically generating and transmitting a transmission signal,
and including a transmitter timer means, said transmitter timer means counting to a first
predetermined value, said transmitter means transmitting said transmission signal when
said transmitter timer means outputs a second predetermined value, and said
transmission signal including timer data indicating output of said transmitter timer
means when said transmitter means transmits said transmission signal; and at least one
receiver means receiving at least one transmission signal, obtaining said timer data from
said received transmission signal, and including receiver timer
