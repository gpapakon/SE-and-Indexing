<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention is related to a sunlight sensor comprising light-cutoff means capable of transmitting
selected sunlight only, and light-detection means, responsive to said sunlight. A sunlight sensor of this kind is known
from GB-A-2,253,516. The light-cutoff means of the known device have the shape of a light insulation member having
a pin hole at the center thereof and the light-detection means are provided in form of a position detecting element onto
which a light beam passing through said pin hole projects a spot. The position of the spot serves for deducing an
information about the direction of incidence which, together with an information about the light beam intensity, allows
calculation of the thermal load in the environment of the light sensor.Furthermore, it is known from PATENT ABSTRACTS OF JAPAN, Vol. 12, No. 192 (P-712), June 14, 1988
and JP-A-62297712 to equalize the visual field characteristics of two detectors in a sun sensor head by providing a
field stopper between two strip like photocells and a light shield part, the two detector photocells being arranged in one
plane parallel to each other and the light shield part having a slit shaped aperture extending orthogonally to said
photocells and also to the length direction of slot like apertures of said field stopper.Sunlight sensors as disclosed in United States Patent No. 3,268,185 and as shown in Fig. 81, have also been
known.The sunlight sensor 1 in Fig. 81 is provided with a light-cutoff means 3, which is formed by the light-receiving
hole 34a which selectively allows sunlight to pass to the top of the light detector 2a. Using a constant illuminated surface
area upon which sunlight strikes light detector 2a, the amount of heat to which incident light is converted, which depends
upon the angle of elevation of the incident sunlight, is obtained from the intensity of illumination light detector 2a.In addition, there is a sunlight sensor as shown in Fig. 82, which was disclosed in Japanese Unexamined
Patent Application Publication (Kokai) No. 2-216402.The sunlight sensor 5 in Fig. 82, in addition to having a cover 6 of the required cover shape to cover the light-detection
section, which is not shown, has, between cover 6 and the light-detection section, a diffuser 7. The cover 6
and diffuser 7 are used to control the intensity of illumination striking the light-detection section, to make the intensity
correspond to the angle of elevation and direction of the sunlight.However, in the sunlight sensor shown in Fig. 81, in the case of
