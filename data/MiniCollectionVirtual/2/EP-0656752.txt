<ABSTRACT>
Reduced calorie french fries and other high moisture fat-coated foods having less greasiness are disclosed. Such products are typically obtained by applying to the surface of the french fry, or other food, reduced calorie fat compositions having particular fluid viscosity characteristics that correlate to reduced greasiness impressions. These reduced calorie fat compositions comprise a nondigestible fat, and optionally, a triglyceride fat or oil. The nondigestible fat in general comprises a liquid nondigestible oil and a sufficient amount of a nondigestible solid polyol polyester to control passive oil loss typically associated with the ingestion of liquid nondigestible oils.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to reduced calorie french fries and other high 
moisture fat-coated foods having reduced greasiness, and a method for preparing these 
foods. Deep-fried food such as chicken, fish, onion rings, and especially french fries are 
widely consumed. French fried potatoes are particularly popular due to their textural 
dichotomy, i.e., they have a crispy exterior and a fairly tender and moist interior. Deep 
frying is the preferred method for imparting textural dichotomy to french fried potatoes. Cold or frozen uncooked or partially cooked (par-fried) potatoes pieces are 
typically deposited in a wire mesh basket which is immersed in a frying fat or oil heated 
to approximately 335° to 400°F (170° to 204°C). The potatoes are typically fried for 
about 120 to about 240 seconds. During frying, the potatoes absorb a substantial 
quantity of the frying fat or oil, typically from about 12 to about 20% by weight. 
Triglyceride frying fats or oils contribute a significant caloric content (about 37.64 Joules 9 calories) 
per gram of oil) to the french fries. Certain polyol fatty acid polyesters are known to be low calorie substitutes for 
frying fats and oils.  
 
For example, EP 0 350 988 discloses a frying fat composition essentially 
consisting of a mixture of one or more non-digestible polyol fatty acid 
polyesters of sufficient solid content and having a slip melting point 
between 35-50°C and one or more glyceride fats having a slip melting 
point below 40°C. Such frying fat compositions offer good frying 
properties, no drip-off problems, nor product mildewing and good oxidative 
stability.  
 
Alternatively, nonabsorbable, nondigestible sugar fatty acid 
polyesters or sugar alcohol polyesters having at least 4 ester groups of fatty acids having 
from 8 to 22 carbon atoms have been used as partial fat replacers in low calorie food 
compositions, including fried foods. (See Mattson et al; U.S. Patent 3,600,186; Issued 
August 17, 1971.) Unfortunately, regular ingestion of moderate to high levels of nondigestible 
polyol polyesters which are liquid at body temperature can result in undesirable passive 
oil loss, i.e., uncontrollable leakage of liquid polyesters through the anal sphincter. 
Solid nondigestible polyesters which have sufficiently high solids content at body 
temperatures (i.e., 37°C) present no anal leakage problem, but they can taste waxy. EP 0 424 067 describes improved polyol fatty acid polyester compositions demonstrating 
a low rheological profile, exhibiting
