<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a deuterated cyclohexane
derivative which is a novel liquid crystal compound useful as
an electro-optic liquid crystal display material and to a
liquid crystal composition containing the same. More
particularly, it relates to a liquid crystal composition
which is not crystallized in low temperatures and yet are not
inferior to generally used liquid crystal compositions in
electro-optic characteristics, such as nematic-isotropic
phase transition temperature, threshold voltage, refractive
index anisotropy, dielectric constant anisotropy, a response
time, and voltage holding ratio. This invention also relates
to a liquid crystal display using the liquid crystal
composition, which is capable of making a display in a stable
manner without suffering from crystallization and exhibits
excellent electro-optical characteristics.Liquid crystal displays have found broad applications
to watches, calculators, measuring instruments, automobile
control panels, word processors, pocket computers, printers,
computers, and TV sets. Liquid crystal display systems
include a twisted nematic (TN) mode, a supertwisted nematic
(STN) mode, a dynamic scattering (DS) mode, a guest-host (GH) 
mode, and a ferroelectric liquid crystal (FLC) mode. The
liquid crystal display driving system has started with a
static driving system, developed into a multiplex driving
system, and recently further developed from a simple matrix
system into an active matrix system.Liquid crystal materials to be used in these displays
are required to satisfy various characteristics in accordance
with the display system or driving system. In particular,
(1) to show a liquid crystal phase in a low-to-high broad
temperature range to be driven in a broad temperature range,(2) to have a low threshold voltage to be driven at a low
voltage, and (3) to have a low viscosity and a short response
time are important characteristics common to all liquid
crystal materials irrespective of the display system or
driving system.For the time being, a liquid crystal compound
satisfying all the requirements (1) to (3) by itself is not
available, and a plurality of liquid crystal compounds must
be mixed to provide a liquid crystal composition which will
exhibit desired characteristics.Among a wide variety of liquid crystal compounds
heretofore developed, those having a cyclohexane skeleton
have been used comparatively widely because they satisfy the
requirements (1) to (3) comparatively.Liquid crystal compounds having a cyclohexane
skeleton are
