<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a process for the preparation of an aqueous suspension of 
microcapsules having a capsule wall of polyurea and encapsulating a water-immiscible 

pesticide, by dispersing a solution of a polyisocyanate in the sparingly water-soluble 
pesticide in water and subsequently reacting the dispersion with a polyamine, which 

process comprises effecting the dispersion of the solution of the polyisocyanate in the 
sparingly water-soluble pesticide in water and the subsequent reaction of the dispersion 

with the polyamine in the presence of at least one water-soluble or water-dispersible 
nonionic surfactant of a block copolymer having at least one hydrophobic block and at 

least one hydrophilic block.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a process for the preparation of microcapsules having a
capsule wall of polyurea and encapsulating a water-immiscible pesticide, by interfacial
reaction of an aqueous dispersion of a solution of a polyisocyanate in the water-immiscible
pesticide and an aqueous solution of a polyamine.It is known per se to prepare microcapsules by interfacial reaction in a dispersion, with
one of the reactive components required to form the capsule wall being dissolved in the
disperse phase and the other being dissolved in the continuous phase.A process for the preparation of microcapsules encapsulating a pesticidal compound and
having a capsule wall of polyurea is described, for example, in US 4,938,797. The process
is characterised by the reaction of the aqueous dispersion of a solution of a polyisocyanate
in a pesticidal compound which is sparingly soluble in water with an aqueous solution of a
polyamine in the presence of a mixture of at least one anionic dispersant and a nonionic
protective colloid and/or a nonionic surfactant.US 4,563,212 and EP 278,878 describe similar encapsulation processes in which
an anionic emulsifier is used. These publications
are silent on the use of nonionic block copolymers as surfactants.Despite the numerous technical improvements in this area, there remains a need for a process
to prepare microcapsules which is ecologically and economically more acceptable.It is an object of the present invention to provide an ecologically more acceptable process
by avoiding the use of anionic dispersants which are often poorly degradable. It is a
further object of the present invention to provide a simpler process while achieving an
equally high concentration of active substance as that achieved in prior art processes and
the same, or slightly improved, efficacy. The process according to the invention uses
fewer ingredients and is therefore economically more attractive. Further advantages for the use of block copolymer surfactants are that their chemical
compositions are well characterised, and their biological degradation is more easy to
monitor.Accordingly, the present invention relates to a process for the preparation of an aqueous
suspension of microcapsules having a capsule wall of polyurea and encapsulating a
water-immiscible pesticide, by dispersing a solution of a polyisocyanate in the sparingly
water-soluble pesticide in water and subsequently reacting the dispersion with a polyamine,
which process comprises effecting the dispersion of the solution of the
