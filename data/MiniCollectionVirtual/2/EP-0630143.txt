<ABSTRACT>
A circuit arrangement for feeding digital telecommunication terminals via a transformerless physical two-wire interface, proposes a real choke or resistance feed instead of the previously used phantom circuits. The DC-isolation and the signal input and output are provided by capacitors. Level matching is performed either by appropriate dimensioning of the chokes and resistors or by suitable level matching circuits.

<CLAIMS>
Circuit arrangement for supplying low energy
requirement digital communications terminals via a

transformer-free physical interface, which facilitates
the simultaneous transmission of data in both

directions on a copper, dual-core cable characterised
in that instead of a known, discrete throttle feed (D1)

real feed resistors (R1) of small resistance value are
provided, which are connected in parallel with

adaptation resistors (R2, R3), wherein the signal in-coupling
and out-coupling for data transmission are

performed via condensers (C) connected between the feed
resistors (R1) and the adaptation resistors (R2, R3),

and wherein a level recorder adaptation (PA) is
provided.
