<ABSTRACT>
A two-dimensional scroll icon is provided for scrolling data in a window or 
panel. The scroll icon has a home position. The scroll icon can be dragged in 

any direction away from the home position to provide scrolling. Scrolling is in 
the direction along an imaginary vector extending from the home position to 

the scroll icon. The rate of scrolling is proportional to the distance of the scroll 
icon from the home position. The scroll icon also has characters located 

thereon. Selecting the characters toggles the visibility on and off of the vertical 
and horizontal scroll bars along the sides of the windows.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to methods and apparatuses for scrolling data
on user interfaces of data processing systems.User interfaces on data processing systems typically provide a screen for
displaying data. A common format for presenting data is by windows or
panels. A window has a client area, which is the area where the data is displayed.Typically, the data is larger than the client area of a window, so that the
user only views a portion of the data. To view other portions of the data, the
data is scrolled through the window.If the data is a word processing document, the user may need to only scroll
in one dimension. For example, scrolling would occur from the beginning or
top of the document to the end or bottom. However, on a graphical user
interface, where the data that is displayed in the client area is graphical, the
user may wish to scroll in two dimensions. Such two dimensional scrolling
occurs up or down or right or left (from the user's perspective).In the prior art, scrolling is accomplished by using scroll bars. Each window
is provided with a vertical scroll bar (located on the right side of the window)
and a horizontal scroll bar (located on the bottom side of the window).
Each scroll bar has an outwardly pointing arrow at each end and a slide button
movable along a track between the end arrows. To scroll in one dimension,
the user interacts with the respective scroll bar by either clicking or selecting
one of the end arrows, by clicking in the track area between the desired end 
arrow and the scroll button or by dragging the scroll button towards one of the
end arrows. To scroll in two dimensions requires two separate interactions
with the scroll bars, one interaction with the vertical scroll bar and the other
interaction with the horizontal scroll bar. This creates extra work for the user.
In addition, scroll bars take up a limited amount 
of the client area, thereby reducing the size of the client
area and cluttering the user interface.A prior art method of two dimensional scrolling involves
dragging one of the four corners of a window with a mouse
select button. One problem is that the learning curve for
users of this method is substantial. Another problem is that
this method is difficult for system programmers to implement
because the standard scrolling interactions must be redone.Another prior art method of two dimensional scrolling
uses a mouse pointer to select a non-selectable portion of the
window. For example, to scroll downward, the mouse pointer
contacts the top of the

<CLAIMS>
A method of scrolling data in a client area (37) of a
window (31) on a user interface (17) of a data processing

system (11) in a composite direction (60), said composite
direction (60) comprising a first directional component (53)

and a second directional component (55), said second
directional component (55) being orthogonal to said first

directional component (53), characterised in that it comprises
the steps of :


a) providing an object (51) associated with said window
(31) on said user interface (17), said object (51) occupying a

home position (57);
b) allowing a user to move said object (51) in a
composite direction (60) from said home position (57), and
c) scrolling said data in said client area (37) in said
composite direction (60) .
The method of claim 1 further comprising the steps of :

a) allowing (89) said user to release said object (51);
b) returning said released object (51) to said home
position (57); and
c) stopping (91) the scrolling of said data when said
object (51) is released.
The method of claim 1 or claim 2 further comprising the
step of determining (81) the distance that said object (51) is

located from said home position (57) and wherein said step of
scrolling said data further comprises the step of increasing

the rate of scrolling as said distance increases.
The method of claim 3 wherein the rate of scrolling the
data is proportional to said distance.
The method of any one of the preceding claims wherein
said step of providing said object (51) further comprises the

step of providing a scroll icon (51) in a corner (57) of said
window (31).
The method of any one of the preceding claims further
comprising the steps of:


a) displaying first and second dimensional scroll bars
(39, 41) in said window (31);
b) allowing said user to select a portion (53, 55) of
said object (51) ; and
c) toggling (69, 73) the visibility of a respective one
of said first (39) and second (41) dimensional scroll bars in

response to said user selection.
The method of claim 5 wherein each of said first (39) and
second (41) directional scroll bars has a respective scroll

button (43, 44) movable along said respective scroll bars. 
The method of claim 6, further comprising the step of
moving said scroll buttons in response to said scrolling of

data in said composite direction.
An apparatus for scrolling data in a client area (37) of
a window (31) on a user interface (17) of a data processing

system (11), comprising:

a) means for providing an object (51) associated with
said window (31) on said user interface (17), said object (51)

occupying a home position (57);
b) means (59) for allowing a user to move said object in
a composite direction (60) from said home position (57); and
c) means (81, 83) for scrolling said data in said client
area (37) in said composite direction (60).
The apparatus of claim 9 further comprising:

a) means (89) for allowing said user to release said
object;
b) means (91) for returning said released object (51) to
said home position (57); and
c) means for stopping the scrolling of said data when
said object (51) is released.

(81, 83) for scrolling said data further comprises means (83)

distance increases.
The apparatus of claim 11 wherein said means for
scrolling said data increases the rate proportionally to said

distance.
The apparatus of any one of claims 9 to 12 wherein said
means for providing said object (51) further comprises means

(31).
