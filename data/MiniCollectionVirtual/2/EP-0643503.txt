<ABSTRACT>
A communication network (50) and method employing 
chained sequences of communications devices (52, 54, 56, 

58), to support synchronized relaying of data, thus forming 
duplex data buses (60). These data buses support both 

synchronous virtual circuits and a form of synchronized 
interrogate-respond data transfer. Off-bus communications 

devices (164) are permitted to synchronously respond onto 
the bus without time contention.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to data communications networks,
and more particularly to a network employing chained
sequences of communications devices to form a duplex data
bus.Asynchronous interrogate-respond ("I-R") networks are
in use for such applications as test range monitoring, but
these networks are generally limited to a single level of
relay from the control station. For those applications
where a single level relaying is insufficient, this invention
will provide multiple levels of relaying, in a very
efficient manner. Synchronous time-slotted system such as the Position Location Reporting
System (PLRS) and the Joint Tactical Information Distribution System (JTIDS)
in use by the U.S. military provide both communications and position location,
but these existing systems do not adapt well to control applications where rapid
shifts in control loading are needed.A method and a network for time division multiple access data communication
in a network comprising communication devices specially separated and
arranged on a data bus as disclosed in US-A- 4 209 749 combine time
multiplexing and address-channel utilization, wherein signal exchange
expediently proceed between the mobile stations and the main and intermediate
stations representing the transmission sections, under utilization of the time
multiplex technique in the multiple access mode with a rigid time frame and an
address-channel-synchronization. In this prior art method a frequency switch
over by a mobile station as it traverses a transmission section takes place.Patent Abstracts of Japan vol. 11 no. 65 (E-484), 27th February 1987 and JP-A-61
224754 disclose a data flow control system in which a sending station
receives a request of transmission and sends packet described with a sending
time to a next relay station via an OR circuit. The reception station site receives
the said frame, a time stamp read circuit reads it, outputs the result to a
response frame forming circuit to form a response frame, which is sent to the
sending station via the OR circuit. The sending station receives the said
response frame, the time stamp read circuit reads a time stamp and inputs an
inter-network propagation time to a calculation circuit. The calculation circuit
reads the present time from a clock to calculate the propagation time as the half
of the difference between the present time and the sending time. A waiting time
circuit receives this calculated propagation time from the calculation circuit and
the value is used as the inter-network propagation time
