<ABSTRACT>
Protrusions (13) made of an electrically conductive 
material such as a metal or ceramic are formed around a node 

point or a node line of vibrations of a piezoelectric plate (11) 
on two principal planes thereof with a spraying process. The 

piezoelectric plate (11) is held at the protrusions (13) with leaf 
springs on the two principal planes. Thus, the protrusions (13) 

of a small surface area are formed without deteriorating the 
piezoelectric plate (11). The piezoelectric plate (11) can be held 

stably without deteriorating vibration characteristics. An 
alternating voltage is applied to 

electrodes (12) of the piezoelectric 
plate (11) through the electrically conductive protrusions (13). 

Because a spraying process is used, the protrusions (13) can be 
formed thickly in a small area precisely and it held surely 

and reliably with good mechanical strength of the protrusions (13).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a holding structure of a piezoelectric vibrator
comprising a piezoelectric plate made of piezoelectric material, which piezoelectric
plate has electrodes formed on two principal planes thereof, protrusions made from
an electrically conductive material and formed on a node of vibrations of said
piezoelectric plate on each of the principal planes, a holder means for holding the
piezoelectric plate at said protrusions formed on the principal planes of said
piezoelectric plate. Such a holding structure is already disclosed in Japanese utility
model laid-open publication 23617/1993. The present invention particularly relates to a piezoelectric
vibrator made from a piezoelectric material such as a
piezoelectric ceramic, quartz or lithium niobate, which can
be used as a component of an oscillator, a ceramic filter or
the like or in particular to a holding structure of the
piezoelectric vibrator and a manufacturing method thereof.A piezoelectric vibrator is used for mechanical
filters, oscillators, actuators or the like and it is made
from a piezoelectric material such as a piezoelectric ceramic,
quartz or lithium niobate. A suitable vibration mode such as
bending vibration or extensional vibration is selected
according to a frequency range to be used. When an alternating
electric voltage is applied to a piezoelectric vibrator,
it is vibrated due to the piezoelectric effect with a low
vibration loss. Such a piezoelectric vibrator has a large
mechanical quality factor Qm and a large coupling factor.
Therefore, a ceramic filter can have a wider range and a 
vibrator has a better frequency precision than an LC filter
using a capacitor and a coil.In order to utilize such features of a piezoelectric
vibrator, it is important to support or fix a piezoelectric
vibrator correctly and surely at a node where the vibration
amplitude becomes zero so as not to suppress vibrations
generated in the piezoelectric vibrator in a holding structure
thereof.A node in a piezoelectric vibrator is a point or a
line without zero area. Therefore, it is desirable that the
holding structure holds a piezoelectric vibrator at a point
or at a line. However, it is impossible practically to hold
a piezoelectric vibrator at a point or at a line. Further,
it is also needed to hold it stably. Then, a piezoelectric
vibrator is practically held at a point-like area or at a
linear area by sacrificing the characteristics thereof
somewhat.Heretofore, piezoelectric vibrators were supported or
fixed around a node by
