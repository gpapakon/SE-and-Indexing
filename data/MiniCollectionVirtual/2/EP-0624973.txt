<ABSTRACT>
In an image sensor, a plurality of sensors (14) 
are divided into a plurality of small blocks each including 

as many sensors (14) as the channels (C₁ to C₁₆) of 
the output circuit (30). The small blocks are divided 

into a plurality of large blocks (DB₁ to DB₁₁₀) each having 
the same number of small blocks. A selector (18, 20) 

selects a particular small block to be driven in a given 
large block. A drive circuit (40₁ to 40₁₁) sends out to 

each of the large blocks a signal for driving the sensors 
(14) and producing image information.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an image 
sensor used as a device for reading an original in a 
small-sized facsimile or a copying machine. An image sensor of contact type, which is 
capable of reading the original without a reduced-size 
optic system, can have a shorter optic path length and 
therefore can reduce the system size. Such an image 
sensor, therefore, has recently been widely used as an 
image reader for a small-sized facsimile, a hand-held 
scanner or a bar-code reader. A common image sensor comprises a plurality of 
sensors which are arranged linearly along the direction 
of main scanning. Each sensor comprises a photodiode for 
subjecting a light signal from the original to photoelectric 
conversion and a blocking diode for taking out 
charges from the photodiode which are inversely connected 
in front-to-front or in back-to-back. Further, these 
sensors are divided into a plurality of blocks each 
having the same number of sensors as channels (say, 16) 
of an output circuit and are connected in matrix. The 
simultaneous activation of the sets of the photodiode and 
the blocking diode in one block is performed sequentially  
 
for each block thereby to read the one-line image information 
along the direction of main scanning. Fig. 1 is a diagram showing an equivalent 
circuit of a sensor including a photodiode and a blocking 
diode. A photodiode 10 and a blocking diode 12 are made 
of amorphous silicon (a-Si), for example. In the equivalent 
circuit of Fig. 1, the character Cb designates a 
junction capacitance of the blocking diode 12, and Cp the 
junction capacitance of the photodiode 10. In charge storage mode, the potential at point 
G is initially set to approximately 5 volts. When light 
enters the photodiode 10 from the original, charges are 
generated by photoelectric conversion. Positive charges 
are stored in the anode of the photodiode 10 and negative 
charges in the cathode thereof in accordance with the 
amount of light reflected from the original, so that the 
potential at point G gradually decreases. In subsequent 
read mode, when a positive drive pulse of 5 volts is 
applied to the anode (point B) of the blocking diode 12, 
the blocking diode 12 turns on and the charges stored in 
the photodiode 10 are delivered as a light current Is. 
This light current Is flows only during the period when 
the 5-volt drive pulse is applied to the anode of the 
blocking diode 12. This light current Is is supplied to 
the inverse input terminal of and amplified by an 
operational
