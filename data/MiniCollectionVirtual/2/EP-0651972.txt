<ABSTRACT>
A method of generating a natural Doppler speech even in the segmented Doppler mode. After the (I) and (Q) components 
of a Doppler signal are transformed by the Hilbert transformation into the left aural signal (L) and righ aural signal (R), the interval 

waveform (21) between the zero cross points of the aural signals (L) and (R) is taken out so as to form the positive side interval 
waveform (21p) which is produced by making the sign of the interval waveform (21) positive, and the negative side interval 

waveform (21n) which is produced by making its sign negative. In the order of the appearances of the interval waveforms (21,22, 
...), a pair of the positive and negative side interval waveforms of each of the interval waveforms are continuously connected to 

produce a double length aural signal (W1). The double length aural signals (W1, W2, ...), of the respective periods in the pulse 
Doppler mode are connected in order to obtain a continuous aural signal.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method of 
and an apparatus for generating Doppler sounds, and more 
specifically to a method of and an apparatus for 
generating Doppler sounds, wherein natural Doppler 
sounds can be generated even upon segmented Doppler 
modes (each corresponding to a mode in which a pulse 
Doppler mode and a B mode are alternately performed). In each of segmented Doppler modes, a pulse 
Doppler mode (D mode) of 20ms, for example and a B mode 
of 17ms, for example are alternately executed as shown 
in Fig. 6(a). Therefore, Doppler sounds are rendered 
intermittent. As a result, the Doppler sounds are hard 
to be used in diagnosis if they are kept intact. It has therefore been proposed a technique 
wherein Doppler signals produced during D mode periods 
are joined to one another and Doppler signals produced 
during B mode periods immediately after the D modes 
periods are created to thereby make Doppler sounds 
continuous as shown in Fig. 6(b). If joints between  
 
adjacent waveforms are discontinuous, then trickling 
sounds are heard so as to offend the ear. Therefore, 
windows are effected on the joints so as to smooth the 
Doppler signals. As another prior art, there has been known one 
in which signal correlation characteristics are 
determined from Doppler signals produced during D mode 
periods, a coefficient of an FIR filter (Finite Impulse 
Repeat filter) is decided and random data is inputted to 
the FIR filter to thereby create Doppler signals to be 
used during B mode periods immediately after the D mode 
periods and to smoothly join the created Doppler signals 
to the Doppler signals before and after the created 
Doppler signals under the action of windows so that 
Doppler sounds are rendered consecutive. As a further prior art, there has been known 
one in which power spectrums of Doppler signals produced 
during D mode periods existing before and after B mode 
periods are determined, power spectrums for the B mode 
periods are determined by linear interpolation of both 
power spectrums and random phases are given to the power 
spectrums to thereby create Doppler signals to be used 
during the B mode periods and to smoothly join the 
created Doppler signals to the Doppler signals before 
and after the created Doppler signals under the action  
 
of windows so that Doppler sounds are rendered 
continuous. The above prior arts are accompanied by 
problems that although the Doppler signals to be used 
during the B mode periods are created and thereafter 
smoothly joined to
