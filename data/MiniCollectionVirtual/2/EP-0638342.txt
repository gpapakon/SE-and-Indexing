<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a device for supporting a boot on a ski, comprising an untreated PTFE plate (7) assembled by direct contact and intimate surface bonding onto a support (8) made of heat-curable material, more precisely of heat-curable rubber. The device has a relief on its surface, which relief is obtained by deforming the PTFE plate during moulding of its support (8) as a result of the vulcanisation reaction. The vulcanisation furthermore assembles the plate with its support.

<CLAIMS>
Device for supporting a boot on a ski, comprising a plate of 
polytetrafluorethylene (PTFE) (7), characterized by the fact that the PTFE plate (7) is 

assembled by direct contact and intimate surface bonding to a support (8) of a thermo-hardening 
material in the course of a molding and vulcanization operation of the said 

support of thermo-hardening rubber. 
Device according to claim 1, characterized by the fact that the support (8) is 
made of a thermo-hardening rubber. 
Device according to claim 1, characterized by the fact that the plate (7) has 
an upper contact surface in relief. 
Device according to claim 3, characterized by the fact that the plate (7) 
takes on the relief of the upper face of its support (8). 
Device according to clam 3, characterized by the fact that the relief 
comprises on its surface at least one longilinear roll (18, 19) oriented in a transverse 

direction. 
Device according to claim 3, characterized by the fact that the relief 
comprises at least one chevron. 
Device according to claim 3, characterized by the fact that the relief is 
waffle-shaped.  

 
Device according to claim 3, characterized by the fact that the relief 
comprises a plurality of round projections distributed over its upper surface. 
Device according to claim 3, characterized by the fact that the plate (7) 
extends downward along at least a portion of the edges of the support (8). 
Device according to claim 3, characterized by the fact that the relief is 
obtained by deformation of a flat plate (23) of unfinished PTFE against the wall of a mold 

(20) provided with a reversed relief, in the course of the said molding and vulcanization 
operation of the said support of thermo-hardening rubber. 
Ski binding, characterized by the fact that it is equipped with a support 
device according to any of the preceding claims.
