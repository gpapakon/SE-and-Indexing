<ABSTRACT>
A coating composition for imparting a crisp, golden 
brown surface to foodstuffs cooked in a microwave or 

conventional oven in which the composition includes a 
protein/acid/reducing carbohydrate system. The coating 

composition of the present invention includes 0.5 to 10% 
by weight protein, 0.5 to 5.0% by weight food acid, 0.5 

to 5.0% by weight reducing sugar and 55 to 97% by weight 
bulking agents. In a preferred embodiment, enhanced 

crispness and browning are obtained when the protein is 
dairy protein and the bulking agents include rice flour.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention is concerned with a coating 
composition for foods which produces a crisp coat when 
cooked. More particularly, the present invention is 
concerned with a coating composition which produces a 
crisp, golden-brown coating when applied to foodstuffs 
and cooked in a microwave or conventional oven. Many foods such as poultry, meat, fish and 
vegetables are coated with a light coating of flour or 
bread crumbs which on frying in oil develops a 
characteristic crispy, brown-colored coating. However, 
the messiness involved with the preparation of fried 
foods, the ever present danger of spattering oil, and 
the unfavorable dietary aspects associated with fried 
foods have led to the development of coatings which 
attempt to impart a fried appearance to a foodstuff 
which is baked and with the appealing color, taste, and 
texture associated with fried foods. U.S. Patent No. 3,586,512 by Mancuso et al. and 
U.S. Patent No. 3,843,827 by Lee et al. both prepare a 
baked comestible with a fried texture and appearance. 
The Mancuso et al. patent does this by providing a dye  
 
system which changes color during cooking, while the Lee 
et al. patent does this by providing a unique batter 
formulation and dry-mix coating. Other coatings have 
been developed for foodstuffs for the same purpose, 
i.e., to provide a baked food with a surface similar in 
appearance, color and texture to that of coated, deep, 
fat-fried foods, such as U.S. Patent No. 3,852,501 by 
Fazzina et al. However, these coatings rely on high 
levels of shortening to obtain the desired results. In recent years, a number of products have been 
developed and marketed for coating foods prior to baking 
or frying. Their purpose is to produce the desirable 
crisp, browned coating. Such products have found 
considerable market acceptance, especially for the 
preparation of baked foods which resemble fried foods in 
appearance and crispness, but avoid the use of oil and 
other fats. These products work quite well in 
conventional ovens. However, when used in the recently 
developed microwave cooking appliances, the resulting 
product leaves much to be desired. In conventional cooking, however, the surface 
temperature of the foodstuff far exceeds the internal 
temperature, which aids in the crisping and browning of 
the food. Since the heat energy in microwave is 
released internally within the food, the surface remains 
at a relatively even temperature with the interior. 
Therefore, in microwave cooking the high surface 
temperatures
