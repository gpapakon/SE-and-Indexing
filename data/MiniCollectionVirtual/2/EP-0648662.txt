<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a hinge pillar for motor vehicles, comprising an extruded section which is connected to an A-pillar and optionally to a front junction part and also to a door sill, the hinge pillar having an L-shaped cross-section, and the long L-limb being designed for connection to the A-pillar or the junction part and the short L-limb for receiving the hinge parts, and as an extension of the short limb a C-shaped groove being formed with its opening towards the enclosed angle of the L-cross-section, and the base of the L-cross-section being tapered in its width from the C-rail towards the long L-limb.

<CLAIMS>
A hinge pin for motor vehicles, consisting of an 
extruded profile which is connected to an A-pin and 

optionally to a front nodular part and a door sill,
 
characterised in 


that the hinge pin (S) comprises a L-shaped 
cross-section with chambers I, II which enclose an 

angle between the chambers I, II of the L-shaped 
cross-section, with the hinge part being positioned in 

the angle; 
that the long L leg with the chamber I comprises a 
connecting face A towards the A-pin and that the short 

L leg with the chamber II comprises a delimiting face 
T towards the B-pin; 
that while extending around the chamber II, the 
delimiting face projects from the inside to the 

outside; and 
that a C-shaped groove, by means of its opening, 
projects towards the enclosed angle of the L-shaped 

cross-section. 
A hinge pin according to claim 1,
 
characterised in
 
that at least one hinge part is fixed to the C-groove, 

said hinge part consisting of a claw part (1) 
supporting the hinge axis (2) and of an anchoring part 

(3) which is rotatable at the hinge axis (2) between 
the claws and which is slidable into a longitudinal 

groove (10) provided at the door profile.  
 
A hinge pin according to any one of the preceding 
claims,
 
characterised in
 
that the claw part (1) stretches beyond the C-groove 

and extends over the surface of the short L leg. 
A hinge pin according to any one of the preceding 
claims,
 
characterised in
 
that the contact faces (5) between the extension of 

the claw part and the surface of the short L leg are 
roughened. 
A hinge pin according to any one of the preceding 
claims,
 
characterised in
 
that the claw part (1) is provided with oblong holes 

(6, 7) to permit it to be fixed to the C-groove, with 
the longitudinal axis of the oblong holes extending 

transversely to the longitudinal axis of the C-groove. 
A hinge pin according to any one of the preceding 
claims,
 
characterised in
 
that the anchoring part (3) of the hinge is tensioned 

in or clamped into the longitudinal groove (10) of the 
door profile. 
A method of producing a hinge pin using an extruded 
profile which is connected to an A-pin and optionally 

to a front nodular part and a door sill,
 
characterised in 


that the anchoring part (3) of the hinge is inserted 
and clamped into the longitudinal groove (10) of the 

door profile; 
that the claw part (1) of the hinge is slid over the  
 

C-groove and positioned therein, with precision 
adjustment taking place as a function of the door gap 

width by displacing the claw part on the surface of the 
short L leg.
