<ABSTRACT>
The invention concerns a terrestrial digital radio transmission method and the associated receiver. The signal transmitted is a modulated digital signal (CPM signal) with a constant envelope. The frequency bandwidth corresponds to that of an FM-VHF channel. Receivers for the constant envelope CPM signals can be designed in accordance with receiver design concepts normal with FM.
