<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a phase synchronization circuit. Conventionally, various types of phase synchronization circuits have 
been proposed. In order to realize a high-speed pull-in operation and a 
low jitter in a circuit configured to multiplying a frequency of an input 
signal, measures are taken to change a constant of a loop filter by means 
of a synchronism discrimination circuit (for example, Japanese Patent 
Application Laid-Open Publication No. JP-A-2-211718 and No.JP-A-4-241520). One example of such conventional ones is shown in Figure 1, which 
is composed of a phase comparator 1; a synchronism discrimination 
circuit 2; a charge pump circuit 3 comprising a constant current source 7 
of a flow-out type (current value : I1), a constant current source 10 of a 
flow-in type (current value : I2), a PMOS transistor 8, an NMOS 
transistor 9 and an inverter 35; a loop filter comprising a resistor 12 and 
a capacitor 13; a voltage controlled oscillator 14; and a frequency-division 
circuit 16, which are connected as shown.  
 As the phase comparator 1 of Figure 1, a circuit shown in Figure 2 
is well known, which is composed of NAND circuits 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 
26, 27, 28, and 29, which are connected as shown. In Figure 2, an output 
UP and an output DOWN are ordinarily at a high level in response to an 
input R receiving a predetermined input signal and an input V receiving a 
frequency-divided output signal from the frequency-division circuit 16. 
When a trailing edge of the input R is in advance of a trailing edge of the 
input V, the output UP is brought to a low level during that period in 
which die trailing edge of the input R is in advance of the trailing edge of 
the input V. On the contrary, when the trailing edge of the input R is delayed 
from the trailing edge of the input V, the output DOWN is brought to a 
low level during that period in which the trailing edge of the input R is 
delayed from the trailing edge of the input V. The loop filter 11, is a 
circuit for removing a noise generated in the phase comparator 1, and is 
generally constituted of a low pass filter. The voltage controlled oscillator 14 is controlled by an output 
voltage of the loop filter 11 so that an oscillation frequency of the voltage 
controlled oscillator 14 is controlled in accordance with the output voltage 
of the loop filter 11, so as to generate an oscillation signal having a 
frequency corresponding to the output voltage of the loop filter 11. The 
frequency-division circuit 16
