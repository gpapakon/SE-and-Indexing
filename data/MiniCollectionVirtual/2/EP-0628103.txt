<DESCRIPTION>
Improvements in and relating to textile treatmentThis invention relates to the treatment of textile products in the form of fabrics, yarns and cords. It is in particular concerned with the impregnation of such textile products with liquids containing particulate material. In the manufacture of mechanical rubber goods, belting and friction materials including clutch facings, it may be necessary to impregnate a textile product with rubber, resin and inert fillers, the textile product being thereafter incorporated into the finished article, for example by lamination and pressing.The use of textile products as reinforcements for rubber/resin is well-known. Previously natural fibres were used for this, but it is now common practice to use a glass fibre fabric or strand, usually in admixture with organic fibres such as aromatic polya ides, polyi ide, acrylic carbon fibres and/or cellulosic fibres and the like, either as discrete yarns, or more usually in the form of fibre 

blends. Before incorporation into a finished article by winding, lamination or by other means, it is necessary to impregnate the textile product with rubber and a curable resin together with such particulate fillers as are needed to ensure that conversion into the final article achieves good bonding and satisfactory properties.Conventional impregnation practice typically requires the use of a solution of the rubber and resin (or resins) in a volatile organic solvent, in which is also dispersed any particulate fillers. The result is a relatively thick, viscous solution/suspension ("dope") . The textile product as a fabric or as a yarn or bundle of parallel yarns is impregnated by drawing it through a bath of this dope, prior to removal of the solvent by passage through a drying tower, or oven. The use of volatile organic solvents is not generally convenient, since they are costly, and the apparatus for handling them demands great care in its use and maintenance, as well as being subject to strict environmental controls.It is an object of the present invention to provide an impregnation process which does not require the use of organic solvents.According to this invention, a process for the impregnation of a textile product with a rubber and a resin and particulate filler material comprises the steps of 

dispersing the particulate filler and the resin in an aqueous rubber latex containing from 0.01% to about 30% by weight of a water-soluble silicate, said amount being based on the total weight of the dispersion, followed by passing the

CLAIMS
1. A process for the impregnation of a textile product with a rubber and a resin and particulate filler material, comprising the steps of dispersing the particulate matter and the resin in an aqueous rubber latex containing from 0.01% to about 30% by weight of a water-soluble silicate said amount being based on the total weight of the mix, followed by passing the textile product through the aqueous dispersion thus formed.
2. A process according to claim 1 wherein the treated product is subjected to a coagulation treatment to at least partially coagulate the latex.
3. A process according to claim 2 wherein the treatment products is subsequently treated with an acidic solution to at least partially coagulate the latex.
4. A process according to any of claims 1-3 wherein the dipped strand is subsequently dried.
5. A process, according to any preceding claim wherein the water-soluble silicate is sodium silicate. 


6. A process according to claim 5 wherein the sodium silicate is present in an amount of about 0.01% to
30%, by weight of the dispersion referred to the total weight.
7. A process according to any of claims 1-6 wherein at least some of the particulate filler is constituted by a metallic sulphate which reacts with the water- soluble silicate to yield a precipitate of a metallic silicate.
8. A process according to any preceding claim wherein the resin is a phenolic resol, or a phenolic resol modified with resorcinol and/or with a cashew nut shell liquid resin.
9. A process according to any preceding claim wherein the rubber is a carboxylated SBR latex, NBR latex, or mixtures thereof.
10. A process according to any preceding claim wherein the textile product is a fabric.
11. A process according to any of claims 1 to 9 wherein the textile product is a yarn or a bundle of yarns. 


12. A process according to any preceding claim wherein the textile product comprises glass fibres, or mixtures of glass fibres with other inorganic or organic fibres.
13. A process according to claim 12 wherein the textile product further comprises cellulose fibres and/or PAN fibres.
14. A process according to any of claims 10-13 wherein the textile product comprises a yarn or bundle of parallel yarns.
15. A process for the impregnation of a textile strand with an aqueous dispersion of resin binder, rubber and particulate fillers substantially as described with reference to the examples given in the preceding Table.
16. Friction materials incorporating a textile product impregnated by a process according to any preceding claim.
17. A wound clutch facing made by press curing a preform wound from textile strands impregnated by a process according to any of claims 1-15.
18. The use of a process according to any of claims 1 to 15 to make a friction material.
