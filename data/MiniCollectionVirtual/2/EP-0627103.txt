<ABSTRACT>
An image texturing system utilizes theme cells to facilitate generation of terrain image data area-by-area for a display. The system is effective in flight simulation apparatus, as for training pilots. A memory stores theme maps representing areas of specific terrains, e.g. terrains lying below a specific flight path. The theme maps are indexed on a square grid pattern and have feature identification codes located at each grid corner, e.g. forest, water, etc. A selection device controlled by an image generator selects a current theme map and dissects it cell-by-cell to provide corner-referenced representations of a current theme cell, i.e. the feature identification codes identifying the four corners of the current theme cell and its quartered terrain treatments, i.e. forest, ocean, or the like. A terrain storage device stores a library of terrain treatment pattern arrays that are derived, for example, from photo data of forest, ocean, or the like. A terrain treatment pager controlled by the image generator provides representations of select terrain treatments indicated for the current theme cell and selects the type and sequence of the terrain treatment required for generating the current theme cell. A theme element assembler receives the representations of the current theme cell and the select terrain treatments. Using the data, the cell is specified according to rules to provide picture data representing a plurality of terrain treatments with varying patterns.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates generally to a computer 
graphics system for use with image generators. More 
specifically, the invention relates to an image 
texturing system utilizing theme cells for generating 
patches or areas of terrain image data for a display. There are numerous uses for simulated dynamic 
visual image of terrain representing specific areas of 
the world. One such use is in flight simulation systems 
for training pilots. Typically, flight simulation systems generate 
images of the terrain along a particular flight path. 
Accordingly, flight simulation systems enable pilots to 
become familiar with a flight path, prior to undertaking 
an actual flight. Typically in flight simulators, 
computer-generated images of external scenes are viewed 
from the mock cockpit of an airplane, presented on one 
or more display devices, such as a CRT (cathode ray 
tube). The external scenes are generated in real time 
and produce the illusion of actually looking through a 
cockpit window at the terrain below, as passed over by a 
moving airplane. In current simulators, the illusion is 
sufficiently realistic to permit substitution of 
training by flight simulator for a significant part of a 
pilot training curriculum. In producing moving simulated images of a 
particular terrain or environment in real time, 
information or data from terrain maps typically is 
retrieved from online data bases. International 
Publication Nos. WO 88/02156 and WO 85/00913 propose  
 
data bases formed by at least two-dimensional terrain 
plan views, whereby each terrain type is identified by a 
particular terrain texture. However, generating geo-specific 
images (high resolution images specific for  
 
the entire terrain that may possibly be traversed during 
a flight) is not always possible or practical. For even 
a small area of terrain, a large amount of map data is 
required to be stored. Even if large amounts of memory 
are available, the extent of the simulated terrain 
remains somewhat limited. Consequently, improved 
systems are needed to provide simulated terrain displays 
with lesser storage requirements. Generally, the quality of traditional 
simulated terrain images can be improved by utilizing 
aerial photography and/or satellite imaging data; 
however, such techniques involve great expense. 
Moreover, simply blending different aerial photographs 
or imaging phot, data obtained from satellites is 
ineffective, creating rather undefined and fragmented 
images. As with a panoramic scene formed by joined
