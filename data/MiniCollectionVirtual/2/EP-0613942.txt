<DESCRIPTION>
Over the years there has been a constant evolution of cleansing
compositions for the human skin. From the basic use of lye soap to the more
advanced combars and synthetic detergents in both liquid and solid form, there has
been a constant quest for improved compositions having better cleansing activity
but with increased mildness to the skin as well as, inter alia, better sensory
attributes.In WO-A-92/05234, an aqueous liquid cleansing
composition, comprising 0.1-16% of an amphoteric surfactant
which is an imidazolinium derivative, 0.1-16% of a second
amphoteric surfactant which is an aminoalkanoate, and up to
10% anionic surfactant, is described. Examples of the anionic
surfactant are acylated hydrolyzed protein, alkylethersulfate
and N-acyl glutamate.US patent 4,851,154 discloses an aqueous liquid
shampoo, comprising 1-4% coco carboxy glycinate, 1-4.5% of an
alkyl sulfate and 0.5-5% of an alkyl ether sulfate.The European patent application 0 417 619 is concerned
with an aqueous liquid shampoo comprising an amphoteric
surfactant, an acylated hydrolyzed protein and an alkyl ether
sulfate.It has now been discovered that a new composition can be formulated
which is a clear, mild. high foaming body cleanser particularly useful for the face
and hands. The composition provides a proper balance of cleansing activity,
foaming and mildness.In accordance with the invention there is an aqueous clearbody cleanser composition
comprising
a. 5-10 wt% of

wherein R is alkyl and/or alkenyl having an average of from about 8 to 18 carbon
atoms, inclusive;
n is 1, 2 or 3;o, p and q are the same or different and are 1, 2 or 3;X is an alkali metal or amine cation;b. 1 to 8 wt% of
R1-(OCH2CH2)m-OSO3-Y+
wherein R1 is alkyl and/or alkenyl having an average of 8 to 18 carbon
atoms, inclusive;
m is 0 or 1-10,Y is an alkali metal or amine cation;c. 0.5 to 5 wt% of soap of which the fatty acid portion has an average of from 8 to 18 carton atoms;d. 1 to 5 wt% of an acylated hydrolyzed protein salt
wherein the acyl group is alkyl and/or alkenyl carboxy acyl having an average
number of carbon atoms of 8 to 18 carbon atoms, inclusive; and
e. 0.1 - 5 wt% of an acyl glutamate salt wherein the acyl group is alkyl and/or
alkenyl carboxy acyl having an average number of carbon atoms of from 8 to
18 carbon atoms, inclusive.The composition provides excellent cleansing to the body while maintaining
high foaming action and low irritability.The surfactant of formula a helps provide the formulation with appropriate
cleansing activity and foaming
