<ABSTRACT>
Catalysts are based on coprecipitated mixtures, or solid 
solutions, of alkaline earth oxides and rare earth oxides, such as 

magnesium oxide and cerium oxide, Mg₅CeO
x
; or magnesium oxide and 
yttrium oxide, Mg₅YO
x
. The catalysts may also contain a Group IB 
metallic component and further an alkali metal dopant. Preferably Cu 

and K, respectively. 
The catalysts are employable in catalysing aldol 
condensation reactions, at relatively low pressures, leading to the 

selective formation of branched C₄ alcohols.

<DESCRIPTION>
Recently increasing research efforts have been devoted to 
converting syn-gas (CO/CO₂/H₂) to methanol and isobutanol mixtures for 
use as raw materials in methyltertiarybutylether synthesis (MTBE). 
Prior art catalysts consisted of modified methanol synthesis catalysts, 
such as mixtures of manganese, chromium, and (zinc) oxide 
promoted with alkali (Mn(Zn)O/Cr₂O₃/alkali) operated at high 
temperatures, and alkali promoted copper and zinc oxide 
(Cu/ZnO/alkali) operated at low temperatures. Keim et al., Catalysis 
Letters, 3, 59, 1989, describe a palladium supported on a 
coprecipitated manganese, zinc, zirconium, lithium oxide 
(ZrO₂-ZnO-MnO-Li₂O-Pd) catalyst which is highly active and selective 
for a one step synthesis of isobutanol. What is needed in the art is 
a catalyst capable of selectively producing methanol and isobutanol 
mixtures from syn-gas at lower temperatures (e.g. 290-360°C vs. 400°C) 
and pressures (50 atm vs. 100-250 atm). Applicants have discovered new catalysts based on 
coprecipitated mixtures or solid solutions of alkaline earth oxides 
and rare earth oxides, such as mixtures or solid solutions of 
magnesium oxide and cerium oxide, Mg₅CeOx, or magnesium oxide and 
yttrium oxide, Mg₅YOx, which catalyze aldol condensation reactions 
leading to the selective formation of branched C₄ alcohols. 
Applicants' catalysts may also contain a Group IB metallic component 
and further an alkali dopant. Preferably Cu in concentrations of 5 to 
30 wt% inclusive, and K in concentrations of 0.5 to 3 wt% inclusive 
will be used. Applicants' catalysts afford the advantage of being run 
at pressures lower than those required by Keim catalysts and are more 
active and selective to methanol and isobutanol.  The present invention is directed to catalyst compositions 
comprising a coprecipitated mixture or a solid solution of a rare 
earth oxide and a Group IIA oxide. The catalyst composition may further comprise a Group IB 
metal and may still further comprise an alkali dopant. The invention is also directed to the use of the catalysts 
in a syn-gas conversion reaction. The catalysts of the present invention are prepared by 
coprecipitation of rare earth oxides and alkaline earth oxides at 
controlled pH. Preferably the Group IB metal will also be 
coprecipitated. For example copper oxide can be coprecipitated and 
then reduced to Cu prior to catalyst use. During the preparation of 
the instant catalysts, the pH will be controlled between 9-11. The 
catalysts are easily prepared by techniques known to
