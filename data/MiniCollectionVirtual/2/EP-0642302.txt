<ABSTRACT>
The present invention is directed to a new matter of composition in the form of chemical compounds and to methods for enhancing plant growth and the properties exhibited by plants treated with the compounds in accordance with this method. In particular, application of the compounds results in an increase in sugar content, essential oils and proteins along with an increase in total plant biomass. Fruits harvested from treated plants exhibit an accelerated biochemical and structural maturity. Citrus fruits typically show a reduced peel thickness and exhibit significant improvements in vitamin C, carotenoid, and essential oil contents. The methods of the present invention produce balanced improvements in the structural, biochemical, and sensory quality of Citrus fruits. Mixtures of the compounds may be applied. Certain mixtures are known to have synergistic effects. The compounds or mixtures thereof may also be applied in vitro.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention is directed to 
a method of enhancing plant growth by applying a
compound to a plant, and enhancing properties associated
with plants that have been treated with the compound, and
preferred chemical compounds capable of enhancing
plant growth. 
Application of the
compounds results in an increase in sugar content,
essential oils, proteins and an increase in total
plant biomass. Fruits harvested from treated plants
exhibit an accelerated biochemical and structural
maturity. Mature fruits typically exhibit increased
pigment accumulation, increased essential oil
accumulation, and reduced peel thickness. The
methods include application of individual
bioregulator compounds, mixtures thereof, and in
vitro application of individual compounds and
mixtures thereof. Certain mixtures of the
bioregulator compounds exhibit synergistic effects.
The new compounds function as plant bioregulators
and thus enhance plant growth in accordance with the
method of the invention. Developments in agriculture have produced
chemical compounds and methods for their application
which function as plant bioregulators and thus serve
to enhance one or more properties exhibited by the
treated plant. For example, United States Patent
Number 3,671,219 discloses a quartenary ammonium
compound which when applied to plants enhances the
sugar content of sugar cane. United States Patent
Number 4,204,859 discloses that the addition of
certain phenoxytrialkylamines enhance the
hydrocarbon production of rubber in plants. United
States Patent Number 4,159,903 discloses a method
for increasing polyisoprene production in rubber
producing plants such as Guayule. United States
Patent Number 3,833,350 discloses that carotenoid
accumulation in plants can be increased according to
a method comprised of applying compounds including
(halogenated phenoxy) trialkylamines. United States
Patent Numbers 3,864,501, 3,911,148, and 3,911,152
disclose a method for increasing the carotenoid
pigments of fruits and vegetables which comprises
the application of compounds including (methyl
phenoxy) trialkylamines. United States Patent Numbers 3,558,640, 2,766,238 and
United Kingdom Patent Number 1,239,567 disclose compounds
related to those according to the invention but for medical
purposes. United States Patent Number 4,797,153 discloses
a method for increasing total plant biomass and 
individual plant constituents such as sugar,
protein, lipid, and essential oils wherein certain
substituted phenoxytrialkylamines and substituted
phenylthiotrialkyl
