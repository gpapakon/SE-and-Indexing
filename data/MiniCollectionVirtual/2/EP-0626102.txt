<ABSTRACT>
A connector (e.g. coaxial connector) comprises a tubular body structure (22, 23) with an axially extending bore therein for receiving an incoming cable (40) (e.g. coaxial) and for accommodating electrically-conductive contact-making means (31) located adjacent a part of the cable within the tubular body structure and electrically coupled with contact means (32) (e.g. pin contact) of the connector. Axially displaceable means (35) at least partly received by the tubular body structure (22, 23) causes the contact-making means (31) to make good electrical contact with a conductor (44) of the cable (40) (e.g. control conductor of coaxial cable) in response to a predetermined axial displacement of the displaceable means (35). The displaceable means (35) has a first positive hold position relative to the tubular body structure in which position the displaceable means acts solely to retain other connector components within the tubular body structure (22, 23). By the predetermined axial displacement of the displaceable means (35) from the first positive hold position to a further positive hold position good electrical contact is established between the contact-making means (31) and the conductor (44) of the cable (40).

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to electrical connectors. The invention relates especially, but not 
exclusively, to electrical connectors of the coaxial type 
in which an electrical connection is made between the 
central conductor of an incoming coaxial cable and contact 
means of the connector without the need for crimping and/or 
other tools. A connector is known from USA Patent Specification 
number 3761870 in which, a cylindrical connector body is 
provided with a contact having one end in the form of a 
collet like clamp. A resilient clamping element which has a 
through bore slides over the collet and is compressible onto 
the collet to effect clamping of a conductor by rotation of 
a hexagonally headed male threaded component which 
cooperates with a female thread in the cylindrical body to 
urge a clamping member to compress the resilient clamping 
element onto the collet. In order to effect clamping two 
hands are required in order to hold the body and rotate the 
nut and there is uncertainty about the degree of clamping 
which results as pressure is gradually applied during the 
screwing action. Another connector is known from USA Patent 
Specification Number 3847463 which has a two part 
cylindrical housing the parts being threadingly engageable 
and housing a collet having a conical end which cooperates 
with a collet closer having a conical through bore which is 
urged onto the conical end by the screwing together of the 
housing parts to close the collet and clamp a conductor 
therein. This construction again relies on the screw action 
of the housing parts to effect clamping with the requirement 
for two handed operation and uncertainty as to the degree of 
clamping that results. The present invention seeks to provide an improved 
connector the previously mentioned disadvantages are  
 
overcome. According to the present invention there is provided 
an electrical connector comprising a tubular body having an 
axially extending bore therein for receiving an incoming 
cable and for accommodating electrically-conductive contact-making 
means located within the tubular body and 
electrically coupled with contact means (e.g. pin contact) 
of the connector, and axially displaceably means at least 
partly received by and axially displaceable within the 
tubular body and effective to cause the contact making means 
to make good electrical contact with a conductor of an 
incoming cable in response to a predetermined axial 
displacement of the displaceable means, characterised in 
that in the assembled

the assembled state of the connector the displaceable means 
(35, 36) has a preclamping position relative to the tubular 

body (22, 23) at which it acts to retain the contact making

to effect displacement to a clamping position which 
establishes good electrical contact between the contact 

making means (32) and the conductor (44).
