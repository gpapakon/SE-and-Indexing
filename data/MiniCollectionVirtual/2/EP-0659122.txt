<ABSTRACT>
A writing instrument clip attachment mechanism is disclosed which prevents the clip (3) from becoming separated from the writing instrument. The clip attachment mechanism located on the writing instrument shaft (1) includes a clip (3) having a folded back base section (4); and a clip attachment section (2) having cooperatively shaped outer and inner surfaces (2A, 2B) for operatively engaging said folded back base section (4); and a cover (5) for attachment to said clip attachment section (2). The base section (4) of the clip (3) is press-fitted into the outer and inner surfaces (2A, 2B) of the clip attachment section (2). The cover (5) covers the press-fitted base section (4) and preferably also helps to lock the base section (4) to the clip attachment section (2), by use of co-operatively shaped convex and concave surfaces formed between the cover and clip attachment section (2).

<DESCRIPTION>
 CLIP ATTACHMENT APPARATUS FOR A WRITING INSTRUMENT Technical Field The present invention relates to a clip attachment apparatus for a writing instrument.Background Art In previous clip attachment mechanisms, at the outer surface of the rear of the shaft, the radial base section of the forward-extending clip attachment section was formed as a whole, and a clip base section was inserted and fixed into an insertion hole which opened at the end of the forward-extending clip attachment section.However, in the above example of prior art, because it is a construction in which a clip base section is inserted and fixed into an insertion hole which opens forwardly at the end of the clip attachment section, there are cases in which the fit of the clip base section and the insertion hole is loose due to such factors as dimensional errors, and there are problems such as the lateral shaking and dropping out of the clip.Disclosure of Invention According to the present invention 

there is provided a writing instrument clip attachment mechanism formed by the press fitting of the folded back base section of the clip into the outer and inner surfaces of the clip attachment section of the shaft and by the attachment of a cover which covers (and also preferably helps lock) said folded back base section to the clip attachment section.In this way, the folded back base section of the clip is press fit into the inner and outer surfaces of the clip attachment section, so there is no danger of the fit of the clip becoming loose, and the lateral shaking and dropping out of the clip can be prevented. Moreover, the external appearance is not compromised because the folded back base section of the clip is covered with the cover.It is therefore an object of the invention to provide a clip attachment structure that locks the clip relative to the structure.It is a feature of the clip attachment structure to include an opening for receiving the bent end of the clip, and to provide a cover that preferably prevents the bent portion of the clip from withdrawing from the opening. Brief Description of the Drawings;The invention will now be described with reference to the accompanying drawings, in which: Figure 1A is a pictorial side view showing a first embodiment of the mechanism of the present design.Figure IB is a front view of the same. Figure 2A is a side view in partial cross section which shows the construction of the mechanism of the present invention.Figure 2B is a cross section taken at
