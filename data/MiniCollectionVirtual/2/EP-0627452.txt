<ABSTRACT>
Polyurethanes and polyesters are described which are the reaction products of an aromatic, 
aliphatic or cycloaliphatic diisocyanate, or of a diacid or diacid derivative respectively, 

with a diol containing a pendent UV-absorbing moiety, optionally also with one or more 
other diols or diamines. These UV-absorbing polycondensates can be applied to the 

surfaces of substrates by exhaustion methods or by spraying and act to protect polymers 
and dyes from degradation by UV radiation. They are therefore useful, either alone or in 

combination with other coating materials, for the treatment of wood, paper, textiles, 
leather or other surfaces which are exposed to degrading radiation.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to protecting porous surfaces from UV degradation. More
particularly it relates to novel polymeric compounds useful for this purpose, to
intermediates used in their preparation and to methods of applying compositions
containing the polymers to porous substrates.Ultraviolet radiation-absorbing compounds are almost universally present in polymers
used in out-door applications. Typically they are molecules of medium molecular weight
with specific UV-absorbing moieties, such as benzotriazoles, and are incorporated into the
bulk of thermoplastics or rubbers during compounding, extrusion or molding steps. Often
they are combined with radical-scavenging molecules, like hindered amines (HALS
= "hindered amine light stabilizers") or phenols.UV absorbers can also be formulated into polymer coating systems in order to protect a
substrate, but in this case their effectiveness is greatly influenced by the physical nature of
the substrate. If the substrate is a hard surface, such as glass, metal or certain finished
wood products, conventional UV stabilizers work quite well in protecting the coating in
which they are applied and the underlying substrate. On porous substrates however, such
as leather, paper or raw wood, their effectiveness is almost entirely lost because most of
the active material diffuses below the surface of the substrate.It has now been discovered that polyurethanes and polyesters of 1,000 to 15,000 molecular
weight and containing at least 5 % and up to 80 % by weight of UV-absorbing moieties
can provide excellent protection against fading of dyes or degradation of the substrate,
even when this substrate is highly porous. Bis-urethanes obtained by reaction of 2 equivalents of hydroxybenzotriazoles or
benzophenones with 1 equivalent of a diisocyanate are described in U.S. Patents 4,061,652
and 4,179,548; as phenol-derived urethanes, they are thermally unstable and reform the
UV-absorbing molecule during heat curing.Bis-ureas obtained from 2 equivalents of aminoalkyl-substituted hydroxybenzotriazoles
and 1 equivalent of a diisocyanate are described in U.S. Patent 5,081,258; here the
essential doubling of the UV-absorbing molecule's molecular weight serves to make the
additive less extractible, less prone to migration and eliminates the formation of colored
complexes with iron or copper.No polyurethanes containing more than two hydroxybenzotriazole or benzophenone units
are described in the literature.The polyurethanes of the present invention are of the general formula
