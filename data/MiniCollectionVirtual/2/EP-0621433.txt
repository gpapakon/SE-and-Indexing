<ABSTRACT>
Hose connection for joining a hose, consisting of a compliant material, to a plate which is provided with an opening which forms the access to the hose. Inserted into one end of the hose is a fixed pipe piece which is supported, by means of a radially encircling collar, against one side of the plate, projects through the latter and is provided with an outwardly directed bead which, in the joined state, is positioned on the other side of the plate, behind the border of the opening, the hose reaching so far between pipe piece and plate that it forms a sealing and pressing zone in the region of the bead and between the plate and the collar.

<CLAIMS>
Arrangement for connecting a hose (10) consisting of an elastic
material to a plate (22), comprising the plate (22) which has

an opening (28) forming the access to the hose, a rigid piece
of pipe (16) which is inserted into one end (12) of the hose

(10) and which penetrates the plate (22) and is supported on
one side (24) of the plate (22) by means of a radially flanged

collar (18), and the hose (10) which extends so far between the
piece of pipe (16) and the plate (22) that it forms a seal in

the region between the plate (22) and the collar (18),
characterized in that
 the piece of pipe (16) is provided with
an outwardly directed bead (20) which is located on the other

side (26) of the plate (22) behind the edge of the opening (28)
in the connected state, so that the hose (10) is clamped

between the bead (20) and the collar (18) in the region of the
opening (28) and forms a sealing and compression zone (30) in

the region of the bead (20).
