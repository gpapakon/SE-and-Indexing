<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method of enzymatic 
polymerization and/or modification of lignin or lignin 
containing materials. The invention also relates to the use of 
this method in the manufacture of wood composites or wood 
laminates. Wood composites such as fibre board and particle 
board are made by binding the material (e.g. wood fibres or 
wood particles) with a suitable binder and pressing, usually 
with heating. Conventional chemical binders for this purpose 
are e.g. urea-formaldehyde resin and phenol-formaldehyde resin. Binders made from enzymatically treated lignin are 
also known. Thus, it has been suggested to use a binder made 
from peroxidase treated lignin (vide e.g. US Patent No. 
4,432,921), but the use of a peroxidase has not previously been 
demonstrated. For wood composites, e.g. for use in construction, a 
high physical strength is generally important. In order to 
obtain high physical strength it is essential that an optimal 
polymerization/modification takes place during binding of the 
material. As a liquid binder material is believed to be a 
prerequisite for optimal polymerization, enzymatic polymerization 
processes, due to the reaction pH of the enzymes hitherto 
employed, optionally involve the addition of organic solvents 
in order to solubilize lignin (vide e.g. EP Patent Application 
No. 354,485). Another way of improving the strength of the composite 
board involves addition of chemical polymerization 
agents, e.g. polydiphenylmethyldiisocyanate (PMDI), (vide e.g. 
EP Patent Specification No. 275,544).  
 It is the object of this invention to provide a 
method of polymerization of lignin or lignin containing 
materials that allows for optimal polymerization/modification 
at elevated pH without need for organic solvents to be added. We have now surprisingly found that peroxidases are 
able to polymerize lignin or lignin containing material at 
elevated pH values, by which there is no need for organic 
solvents to be added to the reaction mixture, provided the 
polymerization is conducted by a controlled addition of 
hydrogen peroxide during the reaction. The invention provides a method of enzymatic polymerization/modification 
of lignin or lignin containing materials, 
the method being improved in respect of polymerization and 
exploitation of the lignin. Moreover, the method does not 
require the addition of organic solvents or chemical polymerization 
agents. Due to the extent of the polymerization achieved by 
this method, it is especially advantageous for
