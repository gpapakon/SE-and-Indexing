<ABSTRACT>
A pulsed battery charger circuit (11) for charging a 
battery (28). A control circuit (17) is responsive to a sense 

circuit (16) that monitors the battery voltage. The control 
circuit (17) pulses a first current source (25) or a second 

current source (20). An amplifier (14) is responsive to the first 
(25) and second (20) current sources for generating first and 

second predetermined voltages between a drive output (12) and 
a sense input (13). The first current source (25) is pulsed when 

the sense circuit (16) senses the battery voltage to be less 
than a first threshold voltage. The second current source (20) 

is pulsed when the sense circuit (16) senses the battery 
voltage to be greater than the first threshold voltage. Both the 

first (25) and second (20) current sources are disabled when 
the sense circuit (16) senses the battery voltage to be greater 

than a second threshold voltage.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates, in general, to battery 
charger circuits, and more particularly to output stage circuits. One type of battery charger is a pulsed battery charger. A 
pulsed battery charger provides charge to a battery on an 
intermittent or periodic basis. In general, this type of charger 
incorporates voltage sense circuitry, control circuitry, and 
drive circuitry. The voltage sense circuitry senses the voltage 
of the battery. The control circuitry determines how the 
battery is charged based on the sensed battery voltage. The 
driver circuitry provides the required current to charge the 
battery. Periodic or intermittent charging is achieved with a 
switchable current source. An application where a pulsed battery charger is needed 
is in charging rechargeable alkaline batteries. Rechargeable 
alkaline batteries require precise charging to a predetermined 
voltage in order to attain maximum use between chargings. 
Overcharging this type of battery by more than a few millivolts 
may cause battery damage. The rechargeable alkaline batteries 
have a high series resistance that produces a voltage drop in 
series with the battery voltage. Sensing the battery voltage 
when charging is not easily accomplished. Pulse charging 
provides an accurate way of sensing battery voltage. The 
voltage is sensed between pulses when the battery is not being 
charged thereby providing an accurate measurement of the 
battery voltage. The average charging current of the battery 
charger can be controlled by the duty cycle of the pulse 
charging system. Most battery chargers are manufactured for simplicity 
and to reduce costs. Standard battery chargers do not provide  
 
the precise control needed to charge a rechargeable alkaline 
battery without damage or shortening the number of times it 
can be charged. It would be of great benefit, if a battery 
charger output stage circuit is provided that could charge a 
battery to a precise voltage. FIG. 1 is a block diagram of a pulsed battery charger 
circuit in accordance with the present invention; FIG. 2 is a block diagram of a sense circuit and a control 
circuit in accordance with the present invention; FIG. 3 is a cross section of epitaxial islands 
demonstrating substrate injection that could affect 
performance of the pulsed battery charger circuit; FIG. 4 is a symbolic representation of a parasitic lateral 
npn transistor as shown in FIG. 3; and FIG. 5 is a schematic diagram of a battery charger output 
stage circuit in accordance with the present
