<ABSTRACT>
The compression algorithms are based on block processing, and the images are of three types, namely "intra" images, "predicted" images and interpolated or "bidirectional" images (B). According to the invention, the memory space of the decoder is organised into five pages, four pages of which are each used to store one image frame of intra or predicted type, and the fifth is divided into areas capable of containing one line of blocks (for example "B2 No. p" indicates the line of blocks number p of an image B No. 2). The bidirectional images being decoded by successive steps of one line of blocks at a time, the lines of blocks in the course of decoding are placed in step at the address on each occasion, in the fifth page, of a line of blocks, the content of which has already been displayed. For example, a line of blocks (B1 No. n-6) which was placed before B2 No. p has already been displaced, and the memory area (------) is therefore free. Applications: digital television.

<CLAIMS>
A method of decoding frames which have been encoded digitally while
using compression, in which the number of pixels to be treated per unit of time is fixed

and a frame is divided into blocks each comprising several pixels in each horizontal and
vertical direction, said compression being based on a treatment in blocks transmitted

sequentially, while each frame is displayed in the form of two fields and may be of at
least three types, 
viz
. of the intraframe type, encoded in absolute values, 
i.e.
 without
reference to other frames, predicted-type frames encoded with reference to a preceding

intraframe or predicted frame, and frames of the bidirectional type encoded with
reference to at least two other frames which are each intraframes or predicted frames,

while certain couples of an intraframe or a predicted frame and of a frame of the
bidirectional type are such that an intraframe or predicted frame serves for encoding or

for decoding the frame of the bidirectional type which must be displayed prior thereto,
and a memory space for storing the frames which have just been decoded or are being

decoded, characterized in that the memory space is arranged in the form of five pages,
four pages of which are used for storing a field of the intraframe type or of the

predicted type each and the fifth page is divided into sections each having a capacity of
an entire part of a field, which sections are used for storing a part of the field of a

frame of the bidirectional type each, said part representing a horizontal band having the
same width as that of the frame and, with the frames of the bidirectional type being

decoded in successive stages of a part of the field or frame at a time, the parts which
have just been decoded or are being decoded are located progressively each time at the

address, in the fifth page, of a section whose contents have already been displayed.
A method as claimed in Claim 1, characterized in that said sections are
line-of-block zones each having a capacity of one line of blocks, 
i.e.
 the quantity of
blocks which, side by side, occupy the length of a frame line, and, with the frames of

the bidirectional type being decoded in successive stages of one line of blocks at a time,
said lines of blocks which have just been decoded or are being decoded are located

progressively each time at the address, in the fifth page, of a line-of-block zone whose 
contents have already been displayed.
A method as claimed in Claim 1 or 2, characterized in that a sectional
control is effected also for the intraframes or predicted frames, for which control each

section used by a part of the field is reallocated for storing a part of the field which has
just been decoded or is being decoded if the contents of this section have already been

displayed and if it is no longer used as a reference for the motion compensations.
A method as claimed in any one of Claims 1 to 3 for decoding images of
the standard quality of 25 frames per second, characterized in that all the pages are

located in one and the same memory unit having a capacity of 16 megabits, while the
frames received for decoding are also located in the remaining part of the memory in

the same unit.
A method as claimed in any one of Claims 1 to 4 for decoding images of
the standard quality of 25 frames per second, characterized in that for the intraframes

the number of delay fields between the start of decoding a field and the start of its
display is three.
A method as claimed in any one of Claims 1 to 3 for the case where
images of 24 frames per second must be displayed at 60 fields per second, characterized

in that for the intraframes the number of delay fields between the start of decoding a
field and the start of its display is four.
A device for decoding frames which have been encoded digitally in a
compressed form, in which the number of pixels to be treated per unit of time is fixed

and a frame is divided into blocks each representing a part of the frame, while with the
compression algorithms for the frames being based on a treatment per block transmitted

sequentially, said frames are each encoded in the form of two fields and may be of at
least three types, 
viz.
 of the intraframe type encoded in absolute values, 
i.e.
 without
reference to other frames, predicted-type frames encoded with reference to a preceding

intraframe or predicted frame, and frames of the bidirectional type encoded with
reference to at least two other frames which are each intraframes or predicted frames,

while at least one couple of an intraframe or a predicted frame and of a frame of the
bidirectional type is such that the intraframe or predicted frame which must be

displayed afterwards serves for encoding the frame of the bidirectional type which must
be displayed prior thereto, a memory comprising frames which have just been decoded

or are being decoded, and a decoding element for decoding the frames which it receives 
in a compressed form and for writing the frames which have been decoded or are being

decoded into the memory, characterized in that said memory is divided into four pages
which are capable of containing a field each and into a fifth page divided into sections,

a section may contain a complete part of a field, and having a size which is larger than
the size of a field plus the size of two sections, said memory also comprising a control

element provided with means for controlling the display of decoded parts of the field or
the frame for frames of the bidirectional type so as to reallocate each section in order to

register a part of the field which has just been decoded or is being decoded if the
contents of this section have already been displayed, and means for applying the

memory addresses to the decoding element, at which addresses the start of each part of
the field or the frame which has just been decoded or is being decoded is written.
A device as claimed in the preceding Claim, characterized in that it is also
provided with section control means for the pages one to four, by which means each

section is reallocated for storing a new part of the field which has just been decoded or
is being decoded if the contents of this section have already been displayed and if it is

no longer used as a reference for the motion compensations.
