<ABSTRACT>
In order to improve the ease in handling and to increase the safety in operation of a fastening device for releasably fastening a handle element (1) to a piece of cooking or serving crockery and having holding members (8, 36, 44) arranged on the piece of cooking or serving crockery which can be brought into mutual frictional engagement, the first holding member arranged on the handle element (1) has at least one lateral extension (2, 3, 4; 28, 3, 30, 31; 41, 42, 43) which does not project into the inner space of the piece of cooking or serving crockery (9) when the handle element (1) is in its fastened state, and the second holding member (8, 36, 44) arranged on the outer side of the piece of cooking or serving crockery (9) has a holding area (5, 6, 7; 39, 40; 45, 46, 47). By twisting over less than 360 , the lateral extension (2, 3, 4; 28, 29, 30, 31; 41, 42, 43) can be brought into frictional engagement with the holding area (5, 6, 7; 39, 40; 45, 46, 47).

A fixing device for the releasable fixing of a 
handle element to a cooking or serving utensil 

comprising retaining elements disposed respectively on 
the handle element and on the cooking or serving 

utensil, said retaining elements being adapted to be 
brought into reciprocal frictional engagement for 

fixing purposes, the first retaining element formed on 
the handle element (1) comprising at least one lateral 

projection (2, 3, 4; 28, 29, 30, 31), which in the 
fixed state of the handle element (1) does not project 

into the interior of the cooking or serving utensil (9) 
and the second retaining element disposed on the 

outside of the cooking or serving utensil (9) has a 

retaining zone (5, 6, 7; 39, 40), wherein by rotation 
through less than 360Â° the lateral projection (2, 3, 4; 

28, 29, 30, 31) is adapted to be brought into 
frictional engagement with the retaining zone (5, 6, 7; 

39, 40) and the retaining zone (5, 6, 7) of the second 
retaining element is formed on the inner flank of a 

partially arcuate bent wire part (8). 
A fixing device according to claim 1, 
characterised in that each lateral projection (2, 3, 4) 

of the first retaining element formed on the handle 
element (1) is directed outwards and has a 

substantially flat contact surface (11) and a flank 
(10) which is inclined to said contact surface. 
A fixing device according to claim 2, 
characterised in that the first retaining element 

comprises three lateral outwardly directed projections  
 

(2, 3, 4), of which the substantially flat contact 
surfaces (11) together form the base surface of an 

equilateral triangle with flattened corners, and in 
that the bent wire part (8) of the second retaining 

element has three curves which form the retaining zone 
(5, 6, 7) and which are disposed substantially on the 

sides of an equilateral triangle which is somewhat 
larger than the base surface of the flat contact 

surfaces (11). 
A fixing device according to claim 1, 
characterised in that the first retaining element of 

the handle element (1) comprises at least one inwardly 
directed lateral projection (28, 29, 30, 31), 

preferably four projections (28, 29, 30, 31), with a 
flat contact surface (32, 33, 34, 35) and the second 

retaining element consists of a bent wire part (36), 
which comprises two substantially parallel U-shaped 

portions which in a first zone (37, 38) extend 
substantially perpendicularly away from the cooking or 

serving utensil (9) and in an adjoining second zone 
(39, 40) each extend, after a bend to the side, 

substantially parallel to the surface of the cooking or 
serving utensil (9). 
A fixing device according to any one of the 
preceding claims, characterised in that the handle 

element (1) comprises a handle protection (21) of 
substantially funnel-shaped cross-section, which 

surrounds from outside the or each lateral projection 
(2, 3, 4; 28, 29, 30, 31; 41, 42, 43) and a circular 

contact surface (22) and/or sealing lip (49) is 
disposed at its bottom edge.  

 
A fixing device according to any one of the 
preceding claims, characterised in that an opening (18, 

48) is disposed inside the surface enclosed by the 
second retaining element, preferably in the centre of 

said surface, said opening connecting the interior of 
the cooking or serving utensil (9) to the exterior. 
A fixing device according to any one of the 
preceding claims, characterised in that one or more 

recesses (13) are disposed in the region of the central 
longitudinal axis and inside the handle element (1), 

function elements (14, 23) being disposed so as to be 
removably or permanently fixed in said recess or 

recesses, and at least one opening (19, 20) is provided 
respectively in the flat contact surface (10) and in 

the region of the bottom contact surface (22) of the 
handle protection (21). 
A fixing device according to any one of the 
preceding claims, characterised in that a function 

element (23) disposed in the recess (13) of the handle 
element (1) fixed on the cooking or serving utensil (9) 

extends at least by part of its measuring surface (26) 
through the opening (18, 48). 
A fixing device according to any one of the 
preceding claims, characterised in that the or each 

lateral projection (2, 3, 4; 28, 29, 30, 31) of the 
first retaining element and/or the retaining zone or 

zones (5, 6, 7; 39, 40) of the second retaining element 
have at least one bevel, preferably with detent 

elements or recesses, which on increasing turning of 
the handle element (1) relatively to the cooking or  

 
serving utensil (9) increase the frictional connection, 

preferably with defined detent positions.
