<ABSTRACT>
Methods and apparatus for applying coating to products such 
as medicaments are disclosed. The present invention provides 

apparatus and methods for controlling the loading and feeding 
of tablets onto carrier plates (50) for transfer to various 

processing stations of the coating system. A novel plate 
indexing apparatus (300) includes a box cam follower device (314) mounted 

to an engagement bar (302) for incrementally advancing the plates 
in a precisely controlled manner. A second complementary 

shaped engagement bar (320) provides a locking mechanism to ensure 
the plates are always under positive control. In one 

embodiment the plate indexing apparatus also controls the 
feeding of the tablets. An alternative embodiment includes a 

vacuum pick-up system for feeding tablets onto the carrier 
plates as the plates are incrementally advanced.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to apparatus and methods
for incrementally advancing a plurality of product carrier
plates through a product feed means of a product coating
system.The present invention is related to US-A-4921108; US-A-4867983;
US-A-4820524; US-A-4966771; and EP-A-0448231.The present invention is also related to European
patent applications EP-A-0611032, EP-A-0614654, EP-A-0607009
and EP-A-0607008, all filed concurrently herewith. Many products, from prescription drugs to commonly available
vitamin tablets to candy, are manufactured in a form which
may be described as a "tablet." The primary function of a
tablet is to provide a single dose or "serving" of the
product in a manner which is convenient to manufacture,
package and consume. As pointed out in my previous patents
and applications, referenced above, it has been found that
certain individuals suffer from physiological and
psychological problems which impede their ability to swallow
tablets. It has also been found that by providing tablets
with a smooth coating, such as a coating comprised of gelatin
or a gelatinous substance that the "swallowability" of a
tablet is greatly enhanced. Such coatings and the general
considerations involved in their application, such as
preparation and drying time, are well known to those of
ordinary skill.In addition to enhanced swallowability, there are numerous
other reasons that it is desirable to provide a coating on a
tablet. Such coatings protect the underlying product from
deterioration and also serve to permit identifying colors or
markings to be incorporated onto the design of the product,
promoting product differentiation and brand identification.
As pointed out in my previous patents and applications, it is
also desirable in some instances to overlap two or more
coatings to form a seam, thereby simulating the appearance of
a hard gelatin capsule while providing a coated, solid (and
thus tamper resistant) product. Methods and apparatus for applying a gelatinous coating or
other coating to a product which is in the form of a tablet
are well known to those of ordinary skill. Such methods may
include pan dipping or vacuum spraying of the coating
material on to the tablet. Such methods are crude, however,
producing uneven coatings which are generally unacceptable
for commercial use. In an effort to improve the state of the
art, the inventions disclosed by my previous patents and
applications have provided methods and apparatus whereby
individual products are held partially within a sleeve or
"colle
