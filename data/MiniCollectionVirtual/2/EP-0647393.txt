<ABSTRACT>
An implement for milking an animal includes a robot 
arm (6) able to carry teat cups (45 to 48), sensor means 

(51), with the aid of which the position of the teats of the 
animal relative to the robot arm (6) can be determined, and 

control means (56, 18, 22, 36, 40, 80 to 83) for conveying 
the robot arm (6) in such a position under the animal's udder 

that the teat cups (45 to 48) can be connected to the teats 
of the animal. The sensor means (51) comprises a laser 

transmitter element (62) and a receiver element (66), while 
the implement is further provided with pivotal means (75) by 

means of which the laser transmitter beam performs a scanning 
movement to determine the position of the teats in a substantially 

horizontal plane.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an implement for
milking an animal, such as a cow, which implement includes a
robot arm able to carry teat cups, sensor means, with the aid
of which the position of the teats of the animal relative to
the robot arm can be determined, and control means for
conveying the robot arm in such a position under the animal's
udder that the teat cups can be connected to the teats of the
animal.Such an implement is known, for example from
FR-A-2 595 197. In suchlike implements, the sensor means
include a camera which complicates the determination of the
teat position, or an ultrasonic beam device which has a
relatively low data rate and an insufficient accuracy.
Intermediate document EP-A-0 306 579 discloses,
such an implement including a sensor
comprising a laser with a pivoting lens for generating a
plane of light, which is subjected to a vertical scanning
movement.In order to improve the implement in this respect,
the implement is characterized by the features of the
characterizing part of claim 1.As it is unknown at which level the teats are
located, according to the invention, an operating cylinder may be
provided, by means of which during scanning the scanning
plane is moved upwardly from a position below the teats to a 
position wherein the coordinates of the teats in polar form
can be determined. Hereby, the scanning plane may extend over
at least two teat cups. Starting from a position below the
animal's udder, the scanning plane is, preferably stepwise,
brought upwardly till one or more teats are observed,
whereafter the teat position can be determined.In particular embodiment, the sensor is pivotably
mounted on a slide on the end of the robot arm. This slide
may be capable of reciprocating by means of a cylinder. The
sensor may be active in two positions of the slide relative
to the teat cups. In a first position, a scanning movement
may be performed over the teat cups to detect the position of
the front teats, while in a second position a scanning
movement is performed over two teat cups to detect
the position of the rear teats.Although the laser transmitter beam may be rotated,
preferably, as only a sector in a horizontal plane has to be
scanned, said transmitter beam may perform a reciprocating
movement symmetrically relative to the longitudinal direction
of the end of the robot arm. The angle of the reciprocating
movement of the laser transmitter beam may be approximately
120°. In a specific embodiment, the implement may be
constructed such, that when during its
