<ABSTRACT>
A twin mass flywheel (10) for a vehicle having two co-axially arranged flywheel masses (11, 12) which are mounted for limited angular rotation relative to each other under the control of pivotal linkages (40) which interconnect the two flywheel masses. Each linkage is in the form of a first link (41) pivotally connected to one (12) flywheel mass, a second link (42) pivotally connected to the other (11) flywheel mass, and a pivot (45) connecting the first and second links. A viscous damping means (40, 46, 53) is provided to resist relative angular rotation between the two flywheel masses.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a twin mass flywheel
arrangement for absorbing or compensating for torsional
vibrations such as can arise in a vehicle transmission
assembly.More particularly, the invention relates to a twin mass
flywheel
according to the preamble of claim 1 as it is
described in WO 89/01097.A problem arises due to the pivotal linkage striking one of
the flywheel masses at extremes of relative rotation, thereby
causing noise.The present invention seeks to overcome the above problem. According to the invention there is provided a twin mass
flywheel for a vehicle comprising two co-axially arranged
flywheel masses which are mounted for limited angular
rotation relative to each other; a plurality of pivotal
linkage interconnecting the two flywheel masses each linkage
comprising a first link pivotally connected to one of the
flywheel masses, a second link pivotally connected to the
other of the flywheel masses, and a pivot for pivotally
connecting the first and second links, said linkage having
a greater mass adjacent the pivot to move outwardly; and a
damping means which in use resists relative rotation
between the two flywheel masses, characterised in that the
damping means is a viscous damping means in the form of an
annular cavity filled with viscous non-newtonian material
and the pivotal linkages are capable of moving through the
viscous material thereby forming said viscous damping means.Preferably one flywheel mass comprises a first annular plate
with a radially outer cylindrical wall forming the annular
cavity, and the other flywheel mass comprises a second
annular plate which encloses the cavity with the pivotal
linkage housed within the cavity. Conveniently each pivot is housed in an individual chamber
located in the cavity, and the cavity or chambers are filled
with a viscous grease.In addition to the damping means defined in claim 1,
the viscous damping means comprises two
relatively rotatable parts, one part being rotatable with
one flywheel mass and the second part being rotatable with
the other flywheel mass, and a viscous fluid is located in a
chamber formed by at least one of said parts so as to act as
a further viscous damper between said parts to oppose
relative rotational movement therebetween.For a better understanding of the present invention and to
show more clearly how to carry it into effect reference will
now be made, by way of example, to the accompanying drawings
in which;
Figure 1 is a cross-sectional view of one embodiment of a
twin mass flywheel according to

A twin mass flywheel (10) for a vehicle comprising two
co-axially arranged flywheel masses (11,12) which are

mounted for limited angular rotation relative to each
other; a plurality of pivotal linkages (40)

A twin mass flywheel as claimed in Claim 3
characterised in that the chambers (46) are separated

from each other by partition walls (47) formed on said
