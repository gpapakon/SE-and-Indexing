<ABSTRACT>
A chair, especially office chair, has an underframe with a seat support (2), on which a seat (3) is mounted so as to be able to pivot about a front, horizontal axis (3a) counter to the force of a restoring spring (6). A back support (4) is fixed so as to be pivotable about a horizontal axis (4a) on the seat support (2) counter to the force of a restoring spring (6). In this arrangement, the pivoting movement of back support (4) and back (5) is necessarily coupled to the pivoting movement of the seat (3). The coupling element is formed by a bending spring (6) which connects the back support (4) to the seat (3). This bending spring (6) is mounted, on one side, on the back support (4) so as to be pivotable about a horizontal axis (4b) and is mounted, on the other side, on the seat (3) so as to be pivotable about an at least approximately horizontal axis (3b). The chair is easily and simply constructed and thus inexpensive to produce. The restoring force of the back into the starting position is dependent on the weight of the user.
