<ABSTRACT>
The present invention relates to a method of manufacture of a capacitive microsensor, consisting in assembling three wafers of silicon which are separated from each other, at least at their periphery, by an insulating band, each of these wafers initially forming part of a slice of silicon, individual devices being formed by cutting the set of slices. The said cutting comprises the steps consisting in cutting out the outer wafers by chemical etching and in cutting out the central wafer along a contour which projects with respect to the outer wafers.

<CLAIMS>
A method of manufacturing of a capacitive microsensor,
consisting of assembling three silicon plates (1, 2, 3)

separated, at least at their circumference, by an isolating
stripe (31, 33), each of the plates being initially a part of a

silicon wafer, individual devices being formed by cutting of the
wafer assembly, characterized in that the cutting includes the

steps of:

cutting the entire contour of the external plates (2,
3) by chemical etching; and
cutting the central plate (1) according to a contour
protruding with respect to the external plates.
The method of manufacturing of a capacitive
microsensor of claim 1, characterized in that the external

silicon plates are oriented in planes (1, 0, 0).
The method of manufacturing of a capacitive
microsensor of claim 1, characterized in that the isolating

stripe (31, 33) is made of silicon oxide.
The method of manufacturing of a capacitive
microsensor of claim 1, characterized in that the upper and lower

surfaces of the protruding portion are covered with a silicon
oxide layer (60).
The method of manufacturing of a capacitive
microsensor of claim 1, characterized in that the periphery of

each of the external plates (1, 3) and one portion at least of
the upper and lower surfaces are covered with a protective

material such as a resin.
