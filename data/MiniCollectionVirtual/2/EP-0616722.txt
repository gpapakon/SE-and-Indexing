<ABSTRACT>
The present invention concerns detectors for ionizing radiation (X-rays, gamma rays, electrons, protons, alpha particles, etc. as well as neutrons) of the gas proportional scintillation counter type. The preferred embodiment for X-ray detection consists in a detector, filled with very pure xenon at atmospheric pressure, with a 2.5 cm diameter radiation window (1), a grid with a spherical (2 cm radius) curvature (2) with its edges placed 0.8 cm away from a plane grid which is placed in contact with or close to a photomultiplier tube (4). This photomultiplier has uniform sensitivity in the 170 nm wavelength region. This detector presents an energy resolution of 8.0 % for 5.9 keV X-rays.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention concerns detectors for ionizing radiation, of
the gas proportional scintillation counter type for X-rays, gamma rays, electrons,
protons, alpha particles as well as other charged particles like deuterons and
mesons, or other nuclear radiation like neutrons. With the principles described in
the present invention it is possible to build gas proportional scintillation counters
with a high energy resolution, even if the radiation windows and/or the detection
volumes have dimensions analogous to those of the secondary scintillation
sensor, generally a photomultiplier.Radiation detectors of the gas proportional scintillation counter
type have been described in the scientific literature since 1967 (C.A.N.Conde and
A.J.P.L.Policarpo, "A gas proportional scintillation counter", Nucl. Instrum.
Meth. 53 (1967) 7) being the most commonly used type the one that uses two
parallel grids (C.A.N. Conde, M.C.M. Santos, M.Fatima A. Ferreira and Celia A.
Sousa, "An argon gas proportional scintillation counter with uniform electric
field", IEEE Trans. Nucl. Sci. NS-22 (1) (1975) 104). The working principle has
been described in detail in the scientific literature (C.A.N.Conde, "The gas 
proportional scintillation counter: evaluation of performances with interest for
analysis by ion beam techniques", Nucl. Instrum. Meth. 149 (1978) 685) and is
briefly described in the following.When ionizing radiation is absorbed in a very pure noble gas
(typically xenon at atmospheric pressure) it produces a primary electron cloud
with a number of electrons which is proportional, within a good approximation,
to the energy of the absorbed radiation (F.P. Santos, T.H.V.T. Dias, A.D.
Stauffer and C.A.N. Conde, "Variation of energy linearity and w value in gaseous
xenon radiation detectors for X-rays in the 0.1 to 25 keV energy range: a Monte
Carlo simulation study", Nucl. Instrum. Meth. A307 (1991) 347). These electrons
are subject to a weak reduced electric field (smaller than IV/cm/Torr) produced
by the application of a voltage (typically 500V) between a plane first grid and the
detector window; then the primary electrons drift towards this grid. The region
between the detector and the first grid is usually called "drift region". Next to the
first grid and parallel to it there is a plane second grid, about 1 cm away. An
electric high voltage (typically 5000 Volts) is applied to the second grid which
produces a strong electric field with an intensity below or near the threshold for
ionization (i.e. 5 V/cm/Torr) (1 Torr =

Gas proportional scintillation counter for ionising radiations
with medium and large size radiation windows (typically larger than 1 cm) and/or

detection volumes, the counter having an axis, the counter comprising a sensor of
detecting scintillation light produced in response to radiation, a first and a second 

grid, with the characteristic that, for compensation of the loss of scintillation light
due to solid angle and reflection effects, the counter utilises (instead of the two parallel plane

grids usually employed in these apparatus) one plane grid and one curved grid with the curvature
calculated in a way so to increase radially with respect to the axis the amount of

scintillation light produced between the plane and the curved grids, or else utilizes the two referred to above parallel
plane grids but with a sensor with an efficiency that increases radially with respect to

the axis, in a way that substantially compensates the losses due to solid angle and
reflection effects.
Gas proportional scintillation counter for ionising radiations
according to claim 3,

characterised in that the loss with the radial distance from the axis of the amount
of light that reaches the sensor due to solid angle and reflection effects, is

substantially compensated by an increasing amount of light due to an electric
field whose intensity increases radially in respect to the axis in a suitable way,

provided the curvature of the first curved grid is properly calculated, which can
be determined from the condition that the integral



remains substantially constant as the radial distance with respect to the axis, r,
increases from zero up to a maximum value r = Rmax (i.e. the maximum distance

for which the first grid presents a curvature), being I(r) the amount of light
detected by the sensor and produced by a single electron which enters the

scintillation region at the radial distance, r, being the integral calculated along the
path, s, of an electric field line that starts in the point where the field line meets

the surface of the curved grid (at the potential V2) that is at the radial distance r 
from the axis and ends in the second plane grid in the point where the field line

meets the surface of this grid (at potential V1), being dn/ds the number n, of
secondary scintillation photons, produced by a single electron drifting along the

unit of path length, s, being w(s) the solid angle through which the electron sees
the sensor, R(s) the average reflectivity of the surfaces of the sensor and h(s) the

average efficiency of the sensor as calculated from the position, s, where the
electron is located.
Gas proportional scintillation counter for ionising radiation
according to claim 3, characterised by the compensation of losses due to solid angle

and reflection effects being achieved with parallel plane grids, which implies that the
number of secondary scintillation photons are substantially constant, but that

through the use of a sensor with an efficiency that increases radially with respect
to the axis, starting with a uniform, or uniformized, sensor and adjusting its

efficiency with a mask of small opaque dots covering its surface, so that it varies
radially with respect to the axis in the convenient way which is determined from

the condition that the integral


remains substantially constant as the radial distance with respect to the axis, r,
increases from zero up to a maximum value m=Rmax (i.e. the maximum mask

diameter), I'(r) is a value proportional to the value I(r) defined in previous
claims, and being the remaining variables the same ones as those in claim 2 and

the integral calculated along the electric field lines between the two parallel to grids
at potential V2, and V1. 
Gas proportional scintillation counter for ionising radiation
which, according to anyone of claims 3 to 5, is characterised by the property that

any ionising event produced by the incident radiation, for example X-rays,
gamma rays, electrons, protons, alpha particles as well as neutrons, which leads

to the formation of a primary electron cloud within an electric field tube of force

starting in the front wall of the sensor and ending in the first grid (either curved
as in claim 4 or plane, as in claim 5) at the radial distance with respect to the axis

r=Rmax (as defined in claims 4 and 5), will produce a scintillation pulse at the
output of the sensor with an amplitude which depends only on the number of

primary electrons and to which corresponds a good energy resolution determined
mainly by the fluctuations in the number of primary electrons produced.
