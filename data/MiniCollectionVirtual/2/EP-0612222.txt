<ABSTRACT>
A modular system of furniture includes a table defining a work surface. A plurality of legs (12) are arranged to support the table top/work surface (14). The legs (12) have a dog leg construction and provide a space between the work surface and the leg which forms part of an elongate space which extends along the edges of the table. Each leg (12) comprises an upper arm (16) and a lower part (18). V-shaped channel means are carried in one or more of the elongate spaces: the channel means are suitable for carrying conduits and the like for providing services. The lower part (18) of each leg is hollow and has an annular cross section. Further components of the system such as shelves (76) and service pods have depending legs (78) which are configured to fit inside the lower part (18) of the leg. Removable inserts (24) are provided at the corners of the table top (14) to allow the legs (78) to pass through the table top.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to furniture. In particular it 
relates to a table and to a system of furniture 
including such a table. The table and system are 
particularly suited for use in school laboratories. Traditionally, furniture for school laboratories 
comprises heavy wooden benches and cupboards. Such 
furniture is expensive and inflexible, particularly 
in relation to the provision of services such as gas, 
water, electricity, computer cables and the like. 
Modular systems of furniture for school laboratories 
are known and although these can provide increased 
flexibility, they are still awkward, expensive and 
time-consuming to install. A prior art table is 
described in EP-A-0200739. This table comprises a work 
surface supported on legs with a space being provided 
below the work surface between it and the legs. A Voko 
"Das Bureau" brochure discloses a furniture system having 
undertable channelling for supplying services to work 
areas. The brochure does not, however disclose tables 
with legs having a dog leg construction which enable 
other components to be easily attached to the tables. It is an object of the present invention to alleviate  
 
some or all of the disadvantages of such existing 
furniture. Thus, according to the present invention, there is 
provided a table defining a work surface, said table 
having a plurality of legs arranged to support the 
work surface, one or more of the legs being shaped or 
located to provide a space below the work surface 
between the work surface and the leg, which space forms 
part of an elongate space which extends along or 
adjacent an edge of the table, said table carrying 
channel means disposed in the elongate space which 
channel means are suitable for carrying conduit means or 
the like for the provision of services, characterised 
in that the legs of the table have a dog leg 
construction, each leg having a first upper part which 
is at an angle to the plane of the work surface, and 
a second lower part which is generally perpendicular to 
the work surface. The conduit means may comprise or carry gas pipes, 
electricity cables, computer cables, water or the 
like. 
In a particularly advantageous embodiment the upper part 
of each leg is at an angle to the plane of the work 
surface of between 40° and 70°, typically 55°.  
 Typically the lowermost part of the lower part of the 
leg provides a flange which may be used to secure the 
table to a floor. In a preferred embodiment the work surface overhangs 
the elongate space in which the
