<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a new process 
for preparing a supported metal catalyst suitable for 
hydrogenating organic substances, in particular, food 
oils and fats. It is well known that the most required qualities 
from a catalyst are high activity and selectivity. In 
the case of chemical processes in the liquid phase, in 
which the supported metal catalyst is suspended, in 
powder form, in the reaction media, the causes of low 
catalyst selectivity and activity can be many, ranging 
from phenomena of diffusion of reactants, to an 
unevenness of dispersion of the active phase on the 
carrier. In particular, in the case of the 
hydrogenation of high molecular weight organic 
compounds, such as oils and fats, the diffusion 
phenomena inside the interior of the catalyst pores 
have a high influence on the selectivity and activity 
of the same catalyst. In order to improve such properties, catalyst 
should be used which display a suitable morphology and 
porous structure and a high dispersion of the active 
element, so as to secure high performance behaviour in 
the hydrogenation reaction. For that purpose, nickel-based 
supported catalyst were proposed in which the 
carrier is generated by co-precipitation together with 
the nickel salt.  EP-A-259 119 discloses a process for preparing a 
hydrogenation catalyst in which to an amminocomplex of 
Ni, a solution of sodium aluminate is added. The 
subsequent heating up to 100°C causes both Ni and the 
support to precipitate, with an Ni- and Al-based 
compound being obtained, which is subsequently 
filtered off, dried and activated. In such a process, 
water soluble alkaline aluminates are used which lead 
to the presence of ions in the catalyst which are only 
difficultly removed, and can reduce the performance of 
the same catalyst. In U.S. patent No. 5,112,792, a process is 
disclosed for preparing a silica supported, Ni-based 
catalyst, in which a solution of sodium silicates is 
added to the suspension of nickel salts. Also in this 
case, therefore, difficultly removed elements (e.g., 
Na) are present in the catalyst, which can reduce the 
activity and selectivity performance of the same 
catalyst. The purpose of the present invention therefore is 
a process for preparing a hydrogenation catalyst 
which, besides displaying the advantages deriving from 
an in situ generated carrier, does not suffer from the 
drawbacks found in the hydrogenation catalysts known 
from the prior art. According to the present invention, such a 
purpose is achieved
