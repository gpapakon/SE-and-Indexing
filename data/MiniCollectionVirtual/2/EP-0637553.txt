<ABSTRACT>
A method of and wall sheet for building up a silo with 
lining and a method of manufacturing wall sheets for such a 

silo. The wall sheets are pre-formed wall sheets, comprising a 
base sheet (1) and a sheet (4) of lining material, bonded thereto in a 

slightly staggered manner. The lining material covers a number 
of bolt holes (2,3) of the base sheet (1) and already fitted in the 

covered bolt holes are fastening means, secured against 
rotation and also covered by the lining material. After the 

wall sheet has been mounted, free edge strips of the layer of 
lining material fall over uncovered edge zones of adjacent 

wall sheets. Connecting sheets of lining material are welded 
together along the edges, and, if necessary, the overlapping 

strips are bonded to the subjacent wall sheets.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a method of building up a 
silo or tank with a lining by means of pre-formed wall 
sheets connected to each other by means of screw connections 
for forming a complete silo wall wherein wall sheets are 
used which are provided, along the edges thereof, with bolt 
holes. The invention further relates to a wall sheet for 
building up a silo and to a method of manufacturing such 
wall sheet. US-A-2,729,313 discloses a silo for storing industrial 
and agrarian products, such as for instance manure. The known 
silo is constructed of pre-formed sheets provided with bolt 
holes, screwed together with slight overlap to form a 
normally round silo wall, which is built up on a priorly 
arranged bottom or supporting edge and which may later be 
provided with a suitable roof, if desired. Such silos may 
for instance be built up of stainless-steel wall sheets or 
zinc-coated sheets or as disclosed in US-A-2,729,313 of 
enamelled wall sheets or the like. Normally, the pre-formed 
wall sheets are substantially rectangular and are provided, 
in the edge areas thereof, with a plurality of holes for 
bolts or the like, by means of which the wall sheets can be 
attached to each other with an overlap, with the interposition 
of a suitable sealing material. If a thus constructed silo is intended for storage 
of aggressive substances, it is often necessary to provide 
a special lining of a material resistant to the substances 
in question, because the sealing material and/or the 
material of the wall sheets employed is (are) not resistant 
to the substances to be stored in the silo. According to present-day practice, such lining is 
provided on the inside of a silo after the silo wall has 
been built up entirely. As a consequence, the advantages 
of a silo to be built up of factory-finished, ready-made  
 
wall sheets are partly lost again. Providing a wall covering 
on the sometimes very extensive inner wall of a silo is 
troublesome and time-consuming and moreover requires 
specific equipment which should often be specially 
transported to the building site. If, prior to applying the 
lining, the silo wall should be roughened mechanically 
and/or pretreated chemically, for instance through 
sandblasting, (steel) grit blasting or the like, an oxide 
layer may be formed on a portion of the wall in the time 
which is required for treating the entire silo wall, which 
oxide layer prevents an optimum bond. Further, the weather 
at the building site may cause problems. Comparable problems 
may occur if a
