<ABSTRACT>
A multiplication table repeat learning apparatus for repetitively 
learning a multiplication table is provided. The sounds of the 

multiplication table are separated into the sounds of the respective 
multipliers therein and the separated sounds are stored in the sound 

memory integrate circuit device. Then, the sound of the multiplier group 
which is selected from the multiplication table according to the user's 

selection key depression is output, to thereby enable the user to listen 
to a sound of a desired multiplier group in the multiplication table, and 

improve a learning efficiency of the multiplication table.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a multiplication table repeat
learning apparatus for repetitively learning a multiplication table.Generally, a multiplication table is necessarily used for the
operation of numbers and is supposed to be learnt by heart.In learning such a multiplication table, a conventional learning
method has been performed by writing the multiplication table on a sheet
of paper and repetitively looking at the same to memorize it.Therefore, it was very inconvenient for a learner to see and memorize
the written multiplication table in case of the multiplication table
learning. Also, the learning efficiency was lowered.In another conventional art to improve the learning efficiency, a
sound of the multiplication table is recorded on a cassette tape and the
cassette tape can be repetitively played back, thereby enabling the
learner to learn the multiplication table while listening to the
played-back sound thereof.However, such a repetitive played-back method needs a separate 
expensive audio cassette tape recorder to play back an audio cassette
tape on which the sound of the multiplication table has been recorded.
Accordingly, it was an economical burden to the user. Also, when the
palyback of the sound of the multiplication table has been completed, a
rewind key should be depressed to rewind the audio cassette tape, and
then a playback key should be depressed to play back the same, which
causes the learner much inconvenience.Further, when the learner wants to repetitively learn a desired
portion of the multiplication table by playing back the sound of the
multiplication table, a rewind key and a playback key should be
repetitively depressed to find a desired portion of the cassette tape on
which the sound of the desired portion of the multiplication table is
recorded. Accordingly, it was very difficult and inconvenient for the
repeat learning.Therefore, to solve the above problems, it is an object of the
present invention to provide a multiplication table repeat learning
apparatus for selectively outputting a sound of a desired portion of a
multiplication table according to a learner's key manipulation, without
using a separate cassette tape recorder. To accomplish the above object of the present invetion, there is
provided a multiplication table repeat learning apparatus comprising a
sound memory integrate circuit device in which sounds of the respective
multiplication table are separated into respective multiplier figure
groups and stored, and whose input is connected to a selection key
</DESCRIPTION>
<CLAIMS>
A multiplication table repeat learning apparatus comprising:

a sound memory integrated circuit device (1) in which sounds of a
multiplication table are separated into a respective sound of a plurality

of multiplier groups, and the separated sounds are stored, thereby
outputting a sound of a selected multiplier group;
a plurality of selection keys each of which outputs a selection
signal according to a user's manipulation, to thereby enable the sound

memory integrated circuit device to selectively output a sound of a
selected multiplier group among a plurality of multiplier groups in the

multiplication table; and
amplifier means (2) for amplifying the output signal of the sound memory
integrated circuit device and outputting the amplified signal to a

speaker.
A multiplication table repeat learning apparatus according to
claim 1, wherein said amplifying means comprises a capacitor whose one

end is connected to said sound memory integrate circuit device and the
other end is grounded;


a resistor whose one end is connected to a connection point between

said sound memory integrate circuit device and said capacitor; and
a transistor whose base is connected to the other end of said 
resistor, collector is connected to said speaker, and emitter is

grounded.
