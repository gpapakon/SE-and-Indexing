<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates, in particular, to a motorised roller shutter comprising, on the one hand, a shutter (2) which is wound around and is unwound from a winding shaft (4) inside which is housed a geared drive motor (5), of the tubular type, and on the other hand, means (8) which deliver an electrical signal representing the movement of the shutter (2) and a unit (9) which processes the electrical signal and which can control the operation of the geared drive motor (5), in particular, in order to stop the latter in the event of an obstacle. This motorised roller shutter is characterised in that the said means (8) consist of at least one inductive sensor (10) extending, at least in part, along the path followed by the shutter (2), this inductive sensor (10) being capable of generating an electromotive force under the action of the passage of a permanent magnet (11) attached to the bottom part (12) of the shutter, this electromotive force being detected by the processing unit (9).

Motor-driven roller blind comprising, on the one hand, an apron (2) 
comprised of a juxtaposition of slats (3, 3A, 3B) at least hinged with respect to 

each other the ends (6) of which move in side slideways (7), this apron (2) rolling 
up onto and unrolling from a rolling-up shaft (4) inside which is accomodated 

a drive gear-motor (5) of a tubular kind and, on the other hand, means 
(8) supplying an electric signal representative of the travel of the apron (2) and 

an electric-signal processing unit (9) capable of interfering on the operation of 
the drive gear-motor (5), viz. to control the stoppage of this latter in the event 

of presence of an obstacle, characterized in that the means (8) supplying an 
electric signal representative of the travel of the apron (2) are comprised of at 

least one inductive sensor (10) extending, at least partly, alongside the path 
followed by the apron (2), this inductive sensor (10) being capable of creating 

an electromotive force under the action of the passing-by of a permanent 
magnet (11) associated with the lower portion (12) of the apron (2). 
Motor-driven roller blind according to claim 1, characterized in that 
the processing unit (9) controls the stoppage of the operation of the drive gear-motor 

(5) as soon as it detects the passing of a current through this drive gear-motor 
(5) and the absence of voltage at the terminals of the inductive sensor 

(10). 
Motor-driven roller blind according to any of claims 1 and 2, characterized 
in that the processing unit (9) controls the stoppage of the operation of 

the drive gear-motor (5) when during the unfolding of the apron (2) there is 
detected a reversal of the electromotive force and thus of the voltage at the 

terminals of the inductive sensor (10) without this reversal being caused by a 
control to reverse the movement of the apron through a voluntary action by 

the user on the control means (13) said motor-driven roller blind (1) is provided 
with. 
Motor-driven roller blind according to claim 1, characterized in that 
the inductive sensor (10) is in the shape of an inductance coil the terminals of 

which are connected to the processing unit (9) and which is wound about a 
magnetic support (14) such as a metallic hollow tube. 
Motor-driven roller blind according to claim 4, characterized in that 
the magnetic support (14) has a so reduced cross-section that the inductive 

sensor (10) is capable of being positioned inside a slideway (7) whilst authorizing  
 

the movement within this latter of the ends (6) of the slats (3) the apron 
(2) is comprised of. 
Motor-driven roller blind according to any of claims 1 to 5, characterized 

in that the inductive sensor (10) is installed at the bottom (17) of a slideway 
(7). 
Motor-driven roller blind according to any of claims 1 to 6, characterized 
in that the permanent magnet (11), of the anisotropic ferrite kind, is installed 

inside and at the end (6) in front of an inductive sensor (10) of a slat (3) 
which the lower portion (12) of the apron (2) is comprised of, preferably in the 

last slat (3A) or last but one slat (3B) of this latter. 
Motor-driven roller blind according to claim 4, characterized in that 
the inductance coil includes, at its lower portion (21), a larger number of 

windings with a view to achieving an electric signal of larger amplitude in order 
to control the arrival of the apron (2) at the lower travel end. 
Motor-driven roller blind according to claim 1, characterized in that 
the means (8) form means for controlling the stoppage of the drive gear-motor 

(5) when the apron (2) arrives at the lower travel end and/or at the upper 
travel end. 
Motor-driven roller blind according to claim 9, characterized in that 
the length of the inductive sensor (10) is so determined that at the upper travel 

end and/or at the lower travel end of the apron (2) this inductive sensor is 
no longer under the influence of the permanent magnet (11), leading to an absence 

of electromotive force detected by the processing unit (9) capable of controlling, 
under such circumstances, the stoppage of the operation of the drive 

gear-motor (5). 
Motor-driven roller blind according to claim 1, characterized in that it 
includes switches (22, 23), such as flexible-blade switches or inductive sensors, 

actuated under the action and at the passage-by of the permanent magnet (11) 
associated with the apron (2) to control, either directly or through the processing 

unit (9), the stoppage of the operation of the drive gear-motor (5) when 
said apron (2) arrives at the lower travel end and at the upper travel end. 
Motor-driven roller blind comprising, at the one hand, an apron (2) 
comprised of a juxtaposition of slats (3, 3A, 3B) at least hinged with respect to 

each other the ends (6) of which move in side slideways (7), this apron (2) rolling 
up onto or unrolling from a rolling-up shaft (4) driven by a drive gear-motor

end, characterized in that it includes switches (22, 23), such as flexible-blade 

switches (FBS) or inductive sensors arranged on or inside a slideway (7) and

this very slideway (7), of a slat (3, 3A, 3B) forming the lower portion (12) of the 

apron (12) is provided with.
