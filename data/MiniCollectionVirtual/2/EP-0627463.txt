<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a resin composition 
excellent in flame retardance and heat resistance and to an 
insulating electric wire, a tube, and a heat-shrinkable tube 
using the resin composition. Polyolefin resins have been used in an electric wire 
coating and a tube because of their excellent moldability, 
chemical resistance, flexibility and electrical 
characteristics. To make the polyolefin resins 
non-combustible, flame-retardants or flame-retardant 
assistants are added to the polyolefin resins which are 
essentially combustible. Electric wires and tubes are required to have not 
only flame retardance but heat resistance (heat stability). 
Recently, the size of electric appliances has become small 
and the density of the electric components has increased. 
For this reason, the wires are offten placed near a heat 
source so that the demand for the heat resistance wire has 
been increasing. Halogenated compounds have been considered 
as an excellent flame-retardants. However, most of them, 
tetrabromobisphenol A, chlorinated paraffin, chlorinated 
polyethylene, etc., do not have good heat resistance.  Only decabromodiphenyl ether has been known as a 
flame-retardant satisfying both flame retardance and heat 
stability. In order to further enhance heat resistance by 
using decabromodiphenyl ether as a flame-retardant, it has 
been proposed to incorporate a triazole compound into a 
polyolefin resin as disclosed in JP-B-59-14204. (The term 
"JP-B" used herein means an examined Japanese patent 
publication.) However, the heat resistance of the flame-retardant 
polyolefin resin composition using decabromodiphenyl ether as 
a flame-retardant fails to meet the latest demands for high 
flame retardance and high heat resistance. An object of the present invention is to provide a 
flame-retardant resin composition having both excellent flame 
retardance and excellent heat resistance to meet the above-described 
recent demands. Another object of the present invention is to provide 
an electric wire having an insulating layer comprising the 
flame-retardant resin composition. Further object of the present invention is to provide 
a tube and a heat-shrinkable tube each comprising the flame-retardant 
resin composition. Other objects and effects of the present invention 
will be apparent from the following description.  As a result of extensive investigations on the above-mentioned 
problem, the present inventors have found that a 
crosslinked thermoplastic resin composition containing a 
specific
