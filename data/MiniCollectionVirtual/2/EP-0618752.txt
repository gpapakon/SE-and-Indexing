<ABSTRACT>
A loudspeaker structure suitable for reducing a 
thickness of a loudspeaker, making it resistible to large 

vibration amplitudes, and providing a high performance. 
A repulsion magnetic circuit is formed by two magnets 

with the same poles being faced each other and a center 
plate interposed between the two magnets. The repulsion 

magnetic circuit is held in position by two frames. A 
diaphragm is mounted at the level flush with the center 

of the winding width of a voice coil. The outer 
periphery of an edge (suspension) bonded to the outer 

circumference of the diaphragm is held by flanges of the 
frames.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a structure of a
loudspeaker having a repulsion magnetic circuit, the
loudspeaker being thin and suitable for reproducing low
frequency sounds and reproducing sounds at large
vibration amplitudes.The structure of a conventional loudspeaker having a
repulsion magnetic circuit is shown in Figs. 6 and 7.There is a strong desire to make a vehicle door-mounted
loudspeaker thin and light in weight, because
doors of a vehicle have become thin in order to increase
the inner space of the vehicle and because the space for
mounting the loudspeaker has become small in order to
mount other devices, such as an automatic door locking
mechanism and an automatic window opening/closing
mechanism in the door.A small space in the door means a small space behind
the diaphragm of a loudspeaker, resulting in a poor
acoustic performance. As a result, sounds radiated from
the loudspeaker, particularly low frequency sounds, are 
adversely affected.In order to intensify low frequency sounds, it is
therefore necessary to make a loudspeaker as thin as
possible and the effective space in a door as large as
possible.Japanese Patent Laid-open publication No.1-98400 and
the like teach that a repulsion magnetic circuit
structure is effective in reducing the thickness of a
loudspeaker, the structure having two magnets magnetized
in the thickness direction and disposed with the
poles of the same polarity being facing each other.As shown in Figs.6 and 7, according to this
repulsion magnetic circuit structure, a flat diaphragm
150 is adhered to the upper end of a bobbin 141, and
another diaphragm 152 is adhered to the lower end of the
bobbin 141. The latter diaphragm 152 has an outer
circumference area slanted and raised to the bottom
surface of the flat diaphragm 150 where the diaphragms
150 and 152 are joined together.The repulsion magnetic field type loudspeaker shown
in Fig.6 is structured such that a corrugation or edge
extends radially from the outer circumference of the
diaphragm 150. The diaphragm 150 and corrugation or edge
are disposed above the bobbin 141 and a bobbin coil 140.
A suspension, coil lead wires, input terminals 171, and 
the like are disposed under the bobbin 141.The repulsion magnetic field type loudspeaker shown
in Fig.7 has a triple structure of magnets 131, 132, and
135 constituting a magnetic circuit and a two-stage
structure of upper and lower voice coils 140 and 143 to
which diaphragms 150 and 151 are adhered. This
loudspeaker is therefore thick.In the case of the loudspeaker
