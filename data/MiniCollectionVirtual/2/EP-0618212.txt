acid by means of phosphonomethylation 

of iminodiacetic acid performed by reacting an 
aqueous solution of phosphoric acid and 

hydrochloric acid, obtained by hydrolysis of 
phosphorous trichloride, with iminodiacetic acid 

and formaldehyde, in which: 

a) phosphorous trichloride is hydrolysed with 
water or an aqueous solution of hydrochloric acid, 

the reaction temperature and amount of water are 
regulated such that an aqueous solution of 

hydrochloric acid and phosphoric acid in a molar 
ratio of 0.5:1 to 2:1 is formed, and gaseous 

hydrochloric acid is caused to develop from the 
reaction medium; 
b) the phosphonomethylation reaction is 
performed in the solution obtained in a) in the 

presence of iminodiacetic acid in a molar ratio of 
iminodiacetic acid to phosphoric acid of between 

1:1 and 1:1.2 and with the addition of 
formaldehyde; and 
c) N-phosphono-methyl-imino-diacetic acid is 
recovered from the reaction medium.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an improved process for preparing
N-phosphono-methyl-iminodiacetic acid (PMIDA), also
known as N,N-diacetic iminomethylene phosphonic acid.As is known, a compound of this type is an important intermediate
in the preparation of N-phosphonomethyl glycine, a
broad spectrum herbicide.More particularly, the invention relates to a process for
preparing PMIDA by means of phosphonomethylation of iminodiacetic
acid (IDA) which is performed by reacting an aqueous
solution of phosphorous acid and a strong mineral acid, in
particular hydrochloric acid, with iminodiacetic acid and
formaldehyde.Patents US 3 288 846 and US 3 455 675 describe a process of
phosphonomethylation of IDA performed by preparing IDA hydrochloride
to which there are added further hydrochloric acid
and phosphorous acid and then formaldehyde.EP-A-0 155 926 describes an energy saving process for preparing
PMIDA by reacting an alkali metal salt of iminodiacetic
acid in aqueous strong mineral acid solution with phosphorous
acid and formaldehyde and then adding sufficient water to
dissolve the alkali metal salt formed during the reaction.FR-A-2 626 884 describes a process, wherein PMIDA and a carboxylic
acid chloride are prepared simultaneously by reacting
phosphorous-trichloride and C1-4 carboxylic acid in a molar
ratio of 1:3, separating the phosphorous acidic phase formed
from the carboxylic acid chloride which is isolated, reacting
the phosphorous acidic phase containing carboxylic acid and
carboxylic acid chloride after dilution with water with iminodiacetic
acid and an aqueous solution of formaldehyde, in
the presence of an added strong mineral acid, preferably hydrochloric 
acid, at a temperature between 60-120°C, and
evaporating the mixture until the separation of crystals.Patent IT-1 118 553 describes an alternative process, in
which there is used as the phosphorous source phosphorous
trichloride which is hydrolysed in water to give a solution
in which the reaction products, phosphorous acid and hydrochloric
acid, are in a stoichiometric molar ratio of the hydrolysis
reaction of 1:3. The solution obtained in this way
is then made to react with iminodiacetic acid and then formaldehyde.Although phosphorous trichloride is an economic source of
phosphorous, it has been established that the hydrolysis in
water of phosphorous trichloride, which is an extremely exothermic
reaction, is difficult to control and easily leads to
by-products, particularly to products of oxidation of the
phosphorous acid.Furthermore, the
