<ABSTRACT>
A test method whereby a high current is supplied 
to a first pin (3a) of an integrated device to be 

tested, and the variation in the voltage drop between 
the first pin and a second pin (3b) on the device to be 

tested is determined; the two pins being connected to 
two pads (2a, 2b) in turn connected, inside the device 

to be tested, by a low-voltage-drop path (10). The 
variation in the voltage drop of the device to be tested 

is compared with the measured nominal variation of an 
undoubtedly sound device of the same type, to determine 

any excessive deviation indicative of deficiency. The 
supply current in fact results in power dissipation, 

local heating and, consequently, a variation in the 
resistance of the connecting wires or of the die 

attachment to the lead frame, the extent of which 
differs according to whether only one or both of the 

wires (8) of a two-wire connection (7) to be tested are 
present, and according to whether the die is attached 

properly, poorly or badly to the lead frame. This 
variation in resistance is reflected in the amount or 

speed by which the detected voltage drop varies, thus 
enabling sound parts to be distinguished from faulty 

ones.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method and device 
for testing integrated power devices. As known, on integrated power devices, each 
contact pad on the device is connected to a respective 
pin on the lead frame using two parallel wires, so as to 
increase the maximum current withstandable by the 
connection. A 2 mil gold wire, for example, is incapable 
of withstanding indefinitely a current of over 2 A, so a 
second wire is added parallel to the first to double the 
current capacity. The problem therefore arises of automatically 
testing the integrity and correct bonding of both the 
wires, in view of the bonding process currently employed 
involving a deficiency rate of roughly 50-100 ppm. 
Traditional test methods, however, such as measuring 
pin-to-pin continuity, fail to provide for 
discriminating between a faulty connection in which only 
one wire (of a two-wire connection) is present, and 
correct connection of both wires, in that the resistance 
of gold wires is negligible as compared with the overall  
 
resistance of the circuit under test. For example, a 2 
mil, 3 mm long gold wire presents a resistance of 33 mÎ©. 
Assuming the test is conducted using 1 A current, the 
voltage drop will be 33 mV, which is roughly a hundred 
times smaller than the voltage drop (roughly 3 V) on the 
series diode normally provided. Bearing in mind 
dispersion of the voltage drop on the diode, the 
different voltage drop due to the presence of one as 
opposed to two wires is thus undetectable. One known solution to the above problem consists 
in providing two contact pads connected by a respective 
wire to the same pin. While enabling testing in the 
conventional way, such a solution involves an increase 
in the area of the device, due to the greater number of 
contact pads employed, which, in view of the current 
tendency towards ever increasing miniaturization of 
integrated circuits and devices, is strictly 
undesirable. Moreover, on power devices, the necessity 
frequently arises of testing attachment of the die to 
the lead frame in the areas involving the power elements 
of the circuit (typically the final power stages) for 
ensuring adequate power dissipation. It is an object of the present invention to 
provide a test method designed to overcome the drawbacks 
typically associated with known methods.  
 According to the present invention, there is 
provided a method of testing integrated power devices, 
as claimed in Claim 1. The present invention also relates to a device for 
testing integrated power
