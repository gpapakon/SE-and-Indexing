<ABSTRACT>
The present invention relates to an apparatus (1) efficiently producing brick (53). More specifically, the invention relates to an automated, ultra low profile, continuously moving dryer, kiln and brick handling system which provides efficient, effective heating of the brick, and wherein the kiln uses only top burners (34). The invention thus eliminates the need for burners placed both on top and below the kiln or in other positions throughout the kiln, to provide effective heating.

<DESCRIPTION>
 LOW PROFILE JXN APPARATUSBACKGROUND OF THE INVENTIONThe present invention relates to an apparatus for efficiently producing brick. More specifically, the invention relates to an automated, ultra low profile, continuously moving dryer, kiln and brick handling system which provides efficient, effective heating of the brick, and wherein the kiln uses only top burners. The invention thus eliminates the need for burners placed both on top and below the kiln or in other positions throughout the kiln to provide effective heating.In a typical brick making process, unfired (green) bricks are stacked on the deck of a kiln car traveling on tracks through the kiln. The bricks are typically stacked on the kiln car in piles of about 14 bricks high. The brick stacks may have different configurations but typically the bricks are stacked so as to minimize the thickness of the stack, thereby allowing the hot gases in the kiln to more quickly and evenly heat the brick. The brick stacks are typically arranged in rows, with rows being separated by a distance of 2 to 6 inches which allows better hot gas circulation resulting in quicker and more even firing of the bricks. Brick producing plants producing bricks in this manner typically use a kiln firing time on the order of 30-80 hours, depending upon the particular raw material used to 

 make the brick. Such lengthy firing times are necessary due to the amount and manner in which the bricks are passed through the kiln.Some brick making systems use a "low profile" dryer and kiln. A typical low profile system uses a stack of bricks from 1-8 high. Such a low profile system is disclosed in Applicant's prior U.S. Patent No. 4,773,850. This patent discloses a low profile dryer and kiln, in combination with low mass kiln cars carrying stacks of bricks from high 1-8, which is able to utilize a greatly shortened drying and firing cycle. The present invention is an improvement over Applicants prior U.S. patent, Patent No. 4,773,850, the disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference thereto. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTIONThe present invention provides an ultra-low profile brick making system, i.e., one limited to a stack of bricks no greater than two bricks high. The invention also provides a continuously moving system, i.e., a system wherein a load of green bricks moves continuously through a kiln without interruption. Further the invention is able to achieve effective and efficient firing of the brick by providing a kiln having heating elements or burners only in the top of the

CLAIMS
1. An ultra low profile kiln for continuously firing bricks stacked in a kiln car to a maximum of two rows high comprising: a preheat zone through which combustion gases are drawn to preheat the load of bricks; a furnace zone in which the peak temperature of the kiln is reached, said furnace zone having a plurality of heating elements located only in the top of the kiln roof; and a cooling zone for cooling the fired brick.
2. A kiln as recited in claim 1 wherein the maximum temperature in the furnace zone is 1125 C.
3. A kiln as recited in claim 1 wherein said heating elements comprise high velocity gas burners.
4. A kiln as recited in claim 3 wherein at least a portion of said burners fire at an inclined angle from the roof of the kiln toward the load of brick to be fired.
5. A kiln as recited in claim 1 wherein said furnace zone includes a first area at the entrance of said furnace zone, said first area having a plurality of gas burners positioned in the roof of the kiln and inclined toward the load of brick to be fired, said burners oscillated in pairs of rows so that the fuel/air ratio will remain constant. 


 6. A kiln as recited in claim 1 wherein said heating elements form an oscillating combustion front in the kiln, so that as combustion air pressure in increased on one end of the kiln, it is decreased on the opposite end.
