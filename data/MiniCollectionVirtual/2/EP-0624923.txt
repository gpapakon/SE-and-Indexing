<ABSTRACT>
A connector having a housing made from a polyamide resin composition comprising (A) 65-85 wt.% of a specified aromatic 
polyamide, (B) 5-20 wt.% of a grafted α-olefin random copolymer and/or a grafted aromatic vinyl hydrocarbon/conjugated 

diene copolymer, or a hydrogenated derivative thereof, (C) 0.1-1.0 wt.% of polyethylene wax or a metal salt of a C₂₆-C₃₂ aliphatic 
carboxylic acid based on 100 wt.% of the sum total of the components (A) and (B), and if necessary (D) an antioxidant. The 

invention aims at providing a connector which does not undergo thermal deterioration of the properties such as toughness 
and is especially excellent in formability and lightweight.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to connectors, in particular
those whose characteristics, such
as toughness, are not deteriorated by heating, which can be prepared with excellent
molding workability, and which are especially suitable for use in
automobiles.As plastic materials for automotive connectors, there
have been used, for example, aliphatic polyamides (PA 66, PA
6) and polybutylene terephthalate (PBT).However, aliphatic polyamides tend to absorb water which
decreases their modulus of elasticity, so that there has been a
problem that when a connector made of an aliphatic
polyamide is used in water or under conditions of high
humidity, the connector may loose its firm fitting and may even
be taken out. On the other hand, connectors made of
PBT are heavy due to its high specific gravity. There is
also a problem that the heat resistance of PBT is not always
sufficient.The water absorption characteristics of aliphatic
polyamides can be improved by combining them with an aromatic
polyamide (see JP-A-2-85,208). However, such a combination of aliphatic and aromatic
polyamides may lead to poor moldability. Such poor
moldability can be improved by elevating the molding
temperature, but this gives rise to a new problem that
when a connector of a certain shape is molded, it
may sometimes stick in the mold.In order to solve such a problem of poor mold release
associated with the use of an aromatic polyamide, an
attempt to improve the mold releasability by the addition
of a mold release agent to the aromatic polyamide has been
proposed, for example in JP-A-3-163,165. The mold release
agent used therein includes metallic salts of higher fatty
acids, for example calcium stearate and derivatives of
aliphatic carboxylic acids such as aliphatic alcohol esters
of montanic acid, which can also be used as form release
agents for aliphatic polyamides.It has been found, however, that when a mold release
agent, for example that disclosed in JP-A-3-163,165,
is added to a composition comprising an aromatic polyamide,
the mold release agent may evolve gas and foam during a
molding step, which deteriorates the properties of the
connectors obtained. This is because an aromatic polyamide
has a higher melting point than an aliphatic polyamide, so
that a composition comprising an aromatic polyamide must be
molded at a temperature higher than that of a composition
comprising an aliphatic polyamide. That is, even if it is
intended to prepare connectors from the aromatic polyamide 
composition containing the compound used as the mold
release
