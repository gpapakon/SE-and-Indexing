<ABSTRACT>
Catalyst including an assembly of at least one wire which includes at least, in % by weight, between 60 and 90 % of iron and between 10 and 25 % of chromium, at least one metal chosen from the group consisting of platinum, rhodium, palladium, ruthenium, iridium, gold and silver having been deposited on the assembly, the external outline of the section of the wire being included in the ring whose area is between a circle of 90  mu m diameter and a circle of 5 mm diameter, the length of the wire being at least 20 cm, and the assembly being mechanically consolidated, the wire having been subjected to a previous deposition of aluminium in a proportion ranging up to 10 % by weight relative to the weight of the wire, followed by a redrawing operation. A preferred assembly corresponds to a knitted structure (1) in sock form.

A process for preparing a catalyst comprising an

assembly of at least one wire that comprises, by weight,
about 60 to 90% iron, about 10 to 25% chromium, and up to

about 10%, aluminium, at least one metal selected from the
group formed by platinum, rhodium, palladium, ruthenium,

iridium, gold or silver having been deposited on the
assembly, the outside contour of the cross-section of the

wire being included in a ring whose area is between a
circle with about a 90 µm diameter and a circle with

about a 5 mm diameter, the length of the wire being at
least equal to about 20 cm, and the assembly being

mechanically integral, said process being characterized in
that at least a part of the assembly is subjected, before

its formation, to a depositing of aluminium followed by
redrawing, so as to coat said wire with an aluminium layer

of from 10 to 50 µm thickness, the aluminium so deposited
being at least in part transformed to alumina.
A process according to claim 1, wherein the
assembly is coated before or during metal deposition, the

coating layer consisting mainly of at least one compound
selected from the group formed by the aluminium oxides,

cerium oxides, titanium oxides, silicon oxides, vanadium
oxides and further optionally comprising at least one

compound of an element selected from the group formed by
lanthanum, barium, iron and zirconium.
A process according to one of claims 1 and 2,
wherein the assembly is, prior to the metal depositing step 

of claim 1 or to the coating step of claim 2 subjected to
the following succession of steps:


a) at least one assembly is wound so as to obtain at
least one cylinder,
b) at least one cylinder is treated to transform at
least a portion of the aluminium present into

alumina,
c) at least one cylinder containing alumina is
introduced into a tube,
d) the assembly contained in the tube is rendered
coherent by brazing, soldering or sintering.
A process according to one of claims 1 and 2,
wherein the assembly is, prior to the metal depositing step

of claim 1 or to the coating step of claim 2, subjected to
the following succession of steps:


a) at least one assembly is wound so as to obtain at
least one cylinder,
b) at least one cylinder is introduced into a tube,
c) the cylinder present in the tube is rendered
coherent by brazing, soldering or sintering,
d) the assembly present in the tube is treated to
transform at least a portion of the aluminium

present into alumina.
A process according to one of claims 3 and 4,
wherein an additional intermediate step of compression of

the cylinder is effected between the two successive steps
selected from the group formed by steps (a) and (b) in claim

3, and steps (a) and (b) in claim 4.
A process according to one of claims 1 to 5,
wherein the production of the assembly is at least partially

a knitting or a weaving. 
A catalyst obtained by a process according to one
of claims 1 to 6.
A process of catalytic combustion characterized in
that a catalyst according to claim 7 is used.
A process of catalytic post-combustion of exhaust
gases of internal combustion engines, characterized in that

a catalyst according to claim 7 is used
