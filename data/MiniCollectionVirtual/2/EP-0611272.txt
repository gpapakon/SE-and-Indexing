<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a mixing device for aerating 
and mixing pumpable semi-liquid products as produced in 

the food industry, the pharmaceutical and/or cosmetic 
industry, characterised in that it comprises a mixing 

chamber (2) and a rotor (3) and rotor shaft (4) mounted 
axially therein and extending vertically in the operative 

position of the mixing device.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a mixing device 
for aerating and mixing pumpable semi-liquid products as 
produced in the food industry, the pharmaceutical and/or 
cosmetic industry, comprising, in addition to a frame 
for receiving i.a. pumps, motors, and the like, required 
for circulating both the products to be processed and 
cooling-water, a mixing chamber acting as stator, the 
inner wall of which being provided with radial pins, and 
a rotor axially arranged therein and also provided with 
radial pins, these latter pins rotating between the pins 
belonging to the stator. Mixing devices of the intended type are 
known and have always been designed up to now in such a 
manner that the rotor has its rotor shaft disposed 
horizontally. The term "horizontal" has to be understood 
here very clearly within the scope of the application, 
i.e. in the description and in the claims, as being the 
arrangement of this shaft together with rotor and mixing 
chamber in the operative position of the mixing device. 
Related hereto is that the terms "at the top" and "at 
the bottom" have to be understood in the same spirit. The horizontal arrangement of the rotor 
shaft of mixing devices of the intended type involves a 
number of drawbacks, the most important of which are 
summarized hereinafter. 
1. Due to clear reasons in connection with 
the maintenance of the interior of the mixing chamber 
and the rotor, the shaft of the rotor is cantilevered.  
 
This inevitably results in vibrations in this rotor 
shaft starting from a certain rotational speed. Due to 
these vibrations, the spacing between the pins belonging 
to the inner wall of the cylindrical mixing chamber and 
those belonging to the rotor shaft cannot be taken as 
small as would be desirable. Since the wall of the 
mixing chamber is cooled down, different products 
circulating through the mixing chamber produce a film on 
said fixed and rotating pins which hampers the effect of 
the rotor and therefore of the mixing operation. 2. The horizontal arrangement of the mixing 
chamber of the conventional mixing device produces, due 
to the gravity force, an unbalanced situation of the 
product to be mixed within the mixing chamber. 3. In case of the horizontal arrangement of 
the mixing chamber, the provision of the bearing of the 
relatively long rotor shaft in the mixing chamber 
involves very serious problems as to cleaning and 
maintenance of the device. 4. In case of the up to now usual horizontal 
arrangement of the mixing chamber, there are inevitably 
alway

mixing chamber (2) together with the rotor (3) and rotor 

shaft (4) mounted axially therein extend vertically in 
the operative position of the mixing device. 
A mixing device according to claim 1, 
characterised in that the inlet for supplying the semi-liquid 

products to be mixed is arranged at the bottom in 
the vertically disposed mixing chamber (2) and the 

outlet (8) for the mixed and/or aerated products is 
arranged at the top in the vertical mixing chamber (2). 
A mixing device according to claim 2, 
characterised in that said inlet (7) debouches at the 

bottom in the mixing chamber (2) next to said vertically 
mounted rotor shaft (4). 
A mixing device according to any one 
of the claims 1-3, characterised in that said rotor 

shaft (4) is directly connected to the shaft of the 
driving motor so that no bearing of the rotor shaft (4) 

nor of the mixing chamber (2) has to be provided. 
A mixing device according to any one 
of the claims 1-4, characterised in that a counter 

pressure control regulator is connected to said outlet 
(8) downstream said mixing chamber (2) for building up 

a counter pressure in the outlet (8).
