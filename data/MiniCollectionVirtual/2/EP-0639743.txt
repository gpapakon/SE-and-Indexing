<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a cooking top having a supporting plate (1) consisting of glass or glass-ceramic material, on the upper side of which at least one sensor (7a, 7b, 7b', 7c, 7d) is placed, a covering layer (5a, 5c, 5d, 6b) respectively covering the at least one sensor (7a, 7b, 7b', 7c, 7d).

<CLAIMS>
Cooking field with a support plate (1) which consists of glass or glass-ceramic
material and on the upper side of which at least one sensor (7a, 7b, 7b', 7c, 7d) is

mounted, characterised in that a respective cover layer (5a, 5c, 5d, 6b) covers the at least
one sensor (7a, 7b, 7b', 7c, 7d) and that the cover layer (5a, 5b, 5b', 5d) consists of the

same material as a decorative coating (4b, 4d) of the support plate (1).
Cooking field according to claim 1, characterised in that associated with each at
least one sensor (7a, 7b, 7b', 7c, 7d) is a respective one of connecting lines (8a, 8b, 8b',

8c, 8d), which are each covered by a respective cover layer (5a, 5b, 5b', 5c, 5d, 6b).
Cooking field according to claim 2, characterised in that the at least one sensor
(7b, 7b', 7c, 7d) and the connecting lines (8b, 8b', 8c, 8d) are mounted in at least one

recess (9b, 9c, 9d) formed in the upper side of the support plate (1) and that each cover
layer (5b, 5b', 5c, 5d, 6b) applied to the at least one sensor (7b, 7b', 7c, 7d) and the

connecting lines (8b, 8b', 8c, 8d) does not project above the surface of the support plate.
Cooking field according to one of the preceding claims, characterised in that the at
least one sensor (7a, 7b, 7b', 7c) is geometrically mounted in association with a respective

area region within a cooking zone (3a, 3b, 3c).
Cooking field according to claim 1, 2 or 3, characterised in that the at least one
sensor (7d) is geometrically associated with a respective cooking zone (3d), but is

mounted in an area region outside the cooking zone (3d).
Cooking field according to one of the preceding claims, characterised in that the
cover layer (5c, 6b) covers over area regions on the support plate (1) beyond the areas

which are predetermined by the linear design of the at least one sensor (7b, 7b', 7c).
Cooking field according to one of the preceding claims, characterised in that a
plurality of cover layers (5a, 5b, 5b', 5c, 5d, 6b) is applied adjacent to one another on the

support plate (1) and these are selectably a non-transparent first cover layer (5a, 5b, 5b',
5c, 5d) or a transparent second cover layer (6b). 
Cooking field according to claim 4 in conjunction with claim 7, characterised in that
the first cover layer (5a, 5c), which covers the sensor (7a, 7c) associated with the area

region within the cooking zone (3a, 3c), replaces the decorative coating of this cooking
zone (3a, 3c).
Cooking field according to one of claims 2 to 8, characterised in that the connecting
lines (8a, 8b, 8b', 8c, 8d) are guided at the edge of the support plate (1) up to the region of

a frame (2) enclosing the support plate (1) and from there are conductively connected with
an electronic control system disposed under the support plate (1).
