<DESCRIPTION>
The invention concerns a plant for the treatment of
products, particularly foodstuffs such as preserved meats,
in a ventilated chamber, i. e. an assembly of devices
designed to subject edible products in particular to
processing such as cooking, drying, curing and the like.The prior art involves treatment plants comprising
chambers or cells or areas in general in which the
products, arranged on hangers suspended from guide-rails
or on trolleys, are bathed in a current of air ducted at
controlled pressure, flow-rate and temperature in order to
obtain the required treatment.The hangers, or the trolleys, are distributed in a
plurality of longitudinal rows with, or without, a central
gangway and a pair of lateral gangways adjacent to the
walls on which the said conduits are mounted with
diffusers directed towards the centre of the chamber so
that the air converges towards the centre of the chamber
and flows upwards in the central gangway towards one or
more longitudinal extraction conduits located near the
ceiling.Alternatively, the diffusers may be mounted on the
ceiling, extraction occurring at floor level.It so happens, for example during the drying of sausages,
that the products nearest to the air diffusers, for
example those next to the gangways, are already dry when
the products farthest away are still moist; from which
follows that the continuation of treatment to complete the
drying of the latter makes for the excessive drying, and
hence deterioration in quality, of the former. Furthermore, the presence of the gangways leads to a waste
of space with consequent increase in costs per mass unit
of treated product.Also, the critical height of each cell is limited to 2.5-3
m, given the progressive increase in the humidity of the
air towards the extraction conduits and the consequent
progressive reduction in drying capacity, which leads to a
less than optimum exploitation of the available space in
the production plant.Finally, processing the products in reduced batches, that
is, in insufficient quantity to completely fill a single
cell, is somewhat problematical: this, owing to the
imbalance in the distribution of the air flow inside the
cell induced by the presence of large areas not occupied
by product and in which the greater part of the
circulation of air is concentrated, to the detriment of
the areas in which the product is concentrated, where a
greater circulation is called for; furthermore, this
makes for difficulties in the repeatability of results
obtained in one and the same cell with varying
