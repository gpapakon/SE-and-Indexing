<ABSTRACT>
A miniature motor has a metallic tubular case (1) 
closed at one end and a permanent magnet (2) fitted to 

the inner surface thereof. A case cap (6) closes the 
open end of the case, and a rotor comprising an armature 

(3) and a commutator (4) is rotatably supported by 
bearings (9, 10) provided on the closed end of the case 

(1) and on the case cap (6). A pair of brush holders 
(15) support brushes (45) which make sliding contact 

with the commutator (4), and are mounted on the case cap 
(6) together with a pair of electrically conductive 

connecting members (16). A pair of terminals (18, 17) 
is provided on each brush holder and connecting member 

so that a positive temperature coefficient resistor 
(49), a capacitor (47) and a pair of choke coils (19) 

may be selectively installed on the inner end face of 
the case cap (6).

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a miniature motor of the
type commonly used, for example, in audio equipment,
precision instruments, and automotive electrical
equipment.In known miniature motors, electrical noise is
commonly prevented by connecting a capacitor across the
input terminals. The capacitor is usually provided on an
outer end of the motor case cap. However, additional
space is then required within the system or equipment in
which the miniature motor is incorporated, to prevent
interference with other components. Furthermore, if a
choke coil, for example, is used as an electrical noise
prevention element together with the capacitor, then this
problem could be further aggravated.Alternatively, the electrical noise prevention
element may be provided on the inner end face of the
motor case cap. A pair of brushes may also be provided
on the inner end face of the case cap. Such prior art is
disclosed in EP 0509683 A2. In this prior art a
miniature electric motor comprises a metallic case formed
into a bottomed hollow cylindrical shape, and on the
inner circumferential surface of which a permanent magnet
is fitted. A rotor with an armature and a commutator is
supported in a bearing in the case and a bearing in a
case cover fitted to the open end of the case. Brushes
in the cover make sliding contact with the commutator and
input terminals are electrically connected to the
brushes. One or more electronic components are connected
to the input terminals and held in place by a spring
member made of an electrically conductive material. It
is difficult and complicated to install lead wires for
each noise prevention element and wires for feeding power
to the brushes. Furthermore, the lead wires and the
wires connecting to the brushes may be entangled and
shortcircuited. The present invention is directed at a miniature
motor construction that incorporates fewer different
components, whilst facilitating simple assembly at
relatively low cost. A motor of the type to which the
invention relates has a metallic tubular case closed at
one end with a permanent magnet fitted to the inner
surface thereof; a case cap closing the open end of the
case; a rotor comprising an armature and a commutator,
being rotatably supported by bearings provided on the
closed end of the case and on the case cap; a pair of
brush holders supporting brushes for making sliding
contact with the commutator; and a pair of input
terminals electrically connected to the brushes.
According to the invention, a pair of electrically
conductive connecting
