<DESCRIPTION>
"STEROIDS WITH A FLUORINATED ACYLUREIDIC TYPE SIDE CHAIN"The present invention relates to 4-aza-δα-androstan-3-one and androst-1 , 4-dien-3-one derivatives with a fluorinated acylureidic type side chain, to a process for their preparation, to pharmaceutical compositions containing them, and to the use of said compounds as inhibitors of androgen action, by means of testosterone δα-reductase inhibition. In certain androgen responsive tissues the action of testosterone is mediated primarily through its δα-reduced metabolite, dihydrotestosterone ( DHT) (Bruchowsky N.. Wilson J.D. ; J. Biol. Chem 243, δ9δ3, 1968). The conversion of testosterone to dihydrotestosterone is catalyzed by the enzyme δα-reductase and if δα-reductase is inhibited, the formation of dihydrotestosterone is reduced and its specific androgenic effect is attenuated or prevented.The δα-reductase inhibitors may find medical application for the treatment of hyperandrogenic conditions, e.g. certain prostatic diseases, such as benign prostatic hyperplasia and prostatic cancer, and certain skin-hair conditions, such as acne, seborrhoea, female hirsutism and male pattern baldness (Siiteri P.K. , Wilson J.D. , J. 

 Clin. Invest. 49 , 1737, 1970; Price V.H. , Arch. Dermatol . Ill, 1496, 197ό; Sandberg A.A. , Urology i_7_, 34, 1981). Also breast cancer treatment can take advantage from use of δα-reductase inhibitors as the said tumor is known to δ be aggravated by presence of androgens. Androst-4-en-3- one-17β-carboxylic acid and its methyl ester (Voigt and Hsia, Endocrinology, 9_2, 1216 (1973); Canadian Patent No. 970,692) are among the first steroidic compounds described as δα-reductase inhibitors.10 Two , 1O-secosteroids having a 3-keto-4 , δ-diene system in the expanded ring have been found to be selective inhibitors of rat epididymal δα-reductase (Robaire et al. , J. Steroid Biochem, 8, 307-310 (1977)). The ( 20R)-4-diazo-21-hydroxy-20-methyl-δα-pregnan-3-one lδ and its analogs are reported to be enzyme activated inhibitors of testosterone δα-reductase (Blohm et al . , Biochem. Biophys. Res. Comm 9_δ> 273-80 (1980); United States, Patent 4, 317,817). Another series of enzyme-directed irreversible inhibitors20 of δα-reductase has been prepared by introducing a 6- methylene moiety into substrates type 3-keto-Δ - progestins and androgens (Petrow et al . , Steroids 38 , 3δ2-δ3 (1981); United States Patent 4,396,615). More recently unsaturated derivatives of 3-carboxy2δ. steroids have been reported as uncompetitive δα-reductase inhibitors versus
