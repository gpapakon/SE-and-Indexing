<ABSTRACT>
A method to grow 
in vitro
 TIL cell is 
described, comprising the steps as follows: - a single 

cell dissolution of a tumourous tissue; - a said cell 
first incubation in a culture medium with a serum, that 

allows the lymphocyte growth, comprising interleukin 2 
and phytolectin, for an interval from 3 to 5 days at 

37°C in order to provide a primary culture; - an 
isolation of mononucleated cell of said primary 

culture; and - a second incubation of said monucleated 
cells in a culture medium, that allows the lymphocytes 

growth, comprising Interleukin-2, for an interval from 
10 and 20 days at 37°C. Preferably, the method is used 

to grow TIL cells from NSSC.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a method to cultivate 
TIL cells (tumour infiltrating lymphocytes), mainly 
from no small cell carcinomas (NSCC). References, that in the follow will be 
indicated by numbers between brackets, are listed at 
the end of the description. TIL cells, which may be detected close to solid 
tumours, consist of a T-enriched lymphocyte population, 
able to recognize tumour antigens, expressed on the 
cell surface of autologous neoplastic cells. A TIL cell 
sub-population shows a cytolytic activitiy on said 
autologous neoplastic cells, further to in vitro 
activation and grow in the presence of interleukin-2 
(IL-2). Actually, it was recently found both for 
animals and humans, that a significant regression of 
some tumours, such as methastatic melanoma, could 
result following an intravenous administration of a 
large amount of in vitro grown, IL-2 activated 
autologous TIL cells. US patent 5.126.132 (Rosenberg) 
describes a method to treat some tumours by 
administering TIL cells to patients. However, the 
existing methods to in vitro cultivate and grow TIL 
cells, can be used only for lymphocyte populations 
derived from specific tumours, thus preventing the 
wider use of this therapy. The lung NSCC is a most common neoplasia, that 
is partially insensitive to the chemiotherapy. 
Following a surgery removal and a supporting 
chemiotherapy, patients suffering NSCC tumours at IIIa 
or IIIb advanced stages, have an expected very short 
living time, i.e. 2 years approximatively, and only in 
20% of cases. Accordingly, such patients are ideal  
 
candidates to be subjected to TIL cell 
immunotherapies. Hovever, only very recently TIL cells 
were evidentiated and isolated from NSCC tumours, 
though no positive results are kown in the art, as to 
attemps to in vitro grow TIL cells (1,2). Accordingly, the need results to provide a 
method to cultivate and grow autologous TIL cells from 
tumours of various nature, and, specially, tumours with 
a strong social impact, such as NSCC. The authors make 
available a method to in vitro cultivate TIL cells, 
from lung NSCC tumours, which is able to supply a large 
amount of material, with a cost-contained procedure. 
They found that phytohaemoagglutinin (PHA), which is a 
well known T lymphocyte mitogen, could be used 
advantageously to selectively grow TIL cells from NSCC 
tumours, having a cytolytic activity, but not TIL cells 
from other tumours, such as melanomas. Accordingly, it is an object of the invention a 
method to in vitro cultivate TIL

<CLAIMS>
A method to in vitro cultivate TIL cells, 
comprising the steps as follows: 


to dissociate a tumour tissue to single cells; 
to firstly incubate said cells in a serum 
containing culture medium, which is able to support the 

growth of lymphocytes, comprising IL-2 and PHA, for a 
time ranging from 3 to 5 days, at 37°C, in order to 

obtain a primary culture; 
to isolate mononucleated cells from said primary 
culture; and 
to secondly incubate said mononucleated cells 
again in a serum containing culture medium, which is 

able to support the growth of lymphocytes, comprising 
IL-2 for a time ranging from 10 to 20 days, at 37°C. 
A method to in vitro cultivate TIL cells 
according to claim 1, wherein said dissociation 

comprises a mechanical and an enzymatic dissociation; 
most preferably said enzymatic dissociation is carried 

out through incubating said dissociated tumourous 
tissue with 0.002% of 100 UI/mg DNA-se; 200 UI/ml of 

collagenase and 1500 UI/ml of hyaluronidase for 3-5 
hours at 37°C; said first incubation is carried out at 

an IL-2 concentration of 500 UI/ml and a PHA 
concentration of 1% w/v; said mononucleated cell 

isolation is carried out through treating said primary 
culture on a Ficoll-Hypaque dicontinuous gradient; and 

said second incubation is carried out at a 500 UI/ml 
concentration of IL-2. 
A method to in vitro cultivate TIL cells 
according to any previous claim, wherein said tumour 

tissue is obtained from NSCC.
