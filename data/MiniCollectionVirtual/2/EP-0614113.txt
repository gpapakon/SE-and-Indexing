<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to silver
halide photographic photosensitive materials and
more particularly to ultra-high contrast roomlight
photosensitive materials used in printing plate making
industry.Recently, improvement in efficiency of the
contact work in the field of printing has been demanded
owing to complication of prints and development of
scanners. For this purpose, photographic films of low
sensitivity of as low as about 10-4-10-5 of that of
conventional contact films have been developed and have
been put to practical use as contact films handleable
under roomlight (under white fluorescent lamp from which
ultraviolet ray has been excluded), namely, roomlight
photosensitive materials. Performances required for
such roomlight photosensitive materials are as follows:
They are handleable under roomlight for a long time and
have not only a high sensitivity to a light source of
printers, but also a sufficient maximum density having a
contrast equal to or higher than that of conventional
darkroom photosensitive materials.A special developer called lith developer has
been used for providing high contrast and sufficient
maximum density in this technical field. The lith 
developer contains only hydroquinone as a developing
agent and concentration of free sulfite ion is considerably
reduced by using the sulfite (preservative) in
the form of an adduct with formaldehyde so as to not
restrain the infectious developability. Therefore, the
lith developers have serious defects that they are
highly susceptible to oxidation with air and cannot be
stored for longer than 3 days.In order to obtain high contrast and
sufficient maximum density, US Patent Nos.4,224,401,
4,168,977, 4,166,742, 4,311,781, 4,272,606, 4,221,857
and 4,243,739 disclose methods of using hydrazine
derivatives. Since according to these methods, sulfites
of high concentration can be added to the developers,
stability of the developers against oxidation with air
is markedly improved as compared with the lith
development.However, for exhibiting sufficient effect of
hydrazine derivatives, developers of relatively high pH
are needed and besides, processing at high temperatures
is necessary for completion of the processing in a short
time. Therefore, it has become possible to carry out
the processing at low temperatures and relatively low pH
by adding amine compounds such as alkylamines and
alkanolamines to developers as described in U.S.Patent
No.4,269,929. However, since processing temperature and
pH of these developers are still higher as
