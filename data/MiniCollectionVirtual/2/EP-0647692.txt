<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to the making of a
novel high temperature-resistant masking tape.In the painting of automobile bodies and the like
where it is desired to provide a sharp line of departure
between what is to be painted and what is not to be painted,
it is common practice to apply a masking tape to produce
such a sharp line.Such tapes work quite well but, if the painted
article is subjected to a high drying temperature between
several painting steps, the tape sometimes embrittles and/or
pulls away from the article so paint can get under it in a
later painting step and/or some adhesive from the tape
remains on the article when the tape is removed. Even if
such remaining adhesive can be cleaned off, it must be done
manually and is time consuming and costly.Accordingly, in practice when the painted article
is dried it is necessary that such drying takes place at a
temperature no higher than about 165°C, and generally no
higher than about 150°C to avoid the indicated potential
problems. This also places a lower time limit on the drying
time, i.e. requires long drying times.EP-A-0 367 965 discloses a paper adhesive tape which can be used as a high-temperature masking tape
obtainable by impregnating and coating a paper which, immediately after the production process and still in the
moist state, has been compressed between a rotating roller and a rotating web, and dried. The process uses
primers, anti-adhesive release coats, and self-adhesive materials for coating. The impregnating agent is a
polyacrylate, SBR or PVA latex, the release coat a polyacrylate, SBR latex, PVA, silicone or fluorohydrocarbon,
the primer a centrifuged latex, and the adhesive material is a SIS or SBS rubber, polyacrylate, polyisobutylene or
natural rubber, in combination with natural and/or synthetic resins. It is accordingly an object of the present
invention to provide a paint masking tape which can
withstand high temperatures without loss of properties, and
which therefore can be employed with relatively high
temperature, high speed processing of the painted tape-carrying 
substrate.These and other objects and advantages are
realized in accordance with the present invention pursuant
to which there is provided a novel tape made by a novel
process.Specifically, in the known preparation of a high
temperature-resistant masking tape comprising the steps (a)
impregnating a tape; (b) applying to one face of said tape a
release coat; (c) applying to the other face of said tape an
adhesive, and (d) curing, in accordance with the

<CLAIMS>
In a high temperature-resistant masking tape comprising

a) an impregnated paper substrate having a first and a second surface,
b) a release coating on said first surface,
c) a primer coating on said second surface, and
d) an adhesive coating on said primer coating, the improvement comprising

1) the primer comprising a mixture of a carboxylated SBR rubber latex, a natural
rubber and an acrylic rubber, and
2) the adhesive comprising a cured mixture of natural rubber and an acrylic
synthetic rubber.
A masking tape according to claim 1, wherein the adhesive includes at least one
tackifying resin present in 30 to 60 % by dry weight of the adhesive.
A masking tape according to claim 1, wherein the cured mixture of natural and
synthetic rubber is present as an interpenetrating network of the natural rubber and

of the synthetic rubber.
A masking tape according to claim 1, wherein the adhesive contains 0,1
to 1% dry weight of an antioxidant.
A masking tape according to claim 4, wherein the anti-oxidant comprises a
phosphite plus an amine.
A masking tape according to claim 1, wherein the paper comprises a crepe
paper.
A masking tape according to claim 1, wherein the impregnant is present in
25 to 100 % based on the paper, dry weight, and comprises a mixture of

carboxylated synthetic rubbers. 
A masking tape according to claim 1, wherein the primer further contains a
phenol-formaldehyde curing agent.
