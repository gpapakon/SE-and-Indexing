<ABSTRACT>
Automatic or semiautomatic firearm, such as a pistol, 
rifle or the like, with a laser-beam aiming device. The 

firearm (1) comprises: a frame (2) which slideably 
supports, along a sliding direction substantially parallel 

to the axis (3a) of the firearm barrel (3), a 
slide/breech-block, or breech-block; an automatic re-cocking 

device for the automatic movement of the 
slide/breech-block, or breech-block, with respect to the 

frame (2) along the sliding direction upon firing and for 
its return into the initial position. The firearm has a 

laser-beam aiming device (7) which comprises a container 
(8) accommodating a laser-beam source (9) and connected to 

a support (11) associated with the frame (2) of the firearm

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an automatic or 
semiautomatic firearm, such as a pistol, rifle or the like, 
with a laser-beam aiming device. Automatic or semiautomatic firearms, such as for 
example pistols or rifles, are known which have a laser-beam 
aiming device allowing to obtain greater firing 
precision. These aiming devices generally comprise a laser beam 
source constituted by a special diode arranged inside a 
block fixed to the body or frame of the firearm. Electric 
power is supplied to the diode which emits the laser beam 
by means of batteries or accumulators arranged inside the 
block itself or in appropriate containers connected to the 
diode by means of a wire. Emission of the laser beam, during the aiming of the 
firearm, allows its user to see a bright dot on the target 
which is very close to the point which will be hit by the 
bullet after firing, allowing the user of the firearm to 
rapidly correct his aim and, at the same time, performing a 
deterrent action against the person on which the firearm is 
trained. In currently commercially available firearms, the 
block with the laser beam source is usually provided with a 
contoured support fixed, by means of screws or fixing 
straps, to the frame of the firearm, generally below the 
barrel. Although the presence of a laser-beam aiming device on 
firearms has been appreciated thanks to its undisputed  
 
advantages in terms of precision and effectiveness, it has 
also created some problems which so far have not been 
solved. More particularly, the block containing the laser-beam 
source, once applied to the firearm, unavoidably 
alters its contour and also significantly changes its 
weight distribution, thus altering its balance. Alteration of the contour of the firearm is a 
significant drawback, particularly in the case of pistols 
generally meant to be stored in holsters which are shaped 
according to the contour of the firearm without the laser-beam 
aiming device. Due to this fact, pistols currently 
commercially available with laser-beam aiming devices do 
not fit the holsters meant for them and force the use of 
specifically modified holsters. As regards the change in the balance of the firearm, 
in currently commercially available firearms provided with 
laser-beam aiming devices this can be ascribed to a large 
extent to the position in which the block with the laser-beam 
source is fixed and to the weight of the block and of 
the possible support which fixes it to the firearm frame. The aim of the present invention is to
