<ABSTRACT>
A mobile, hand-held personal communicator 10 includes a casing 12 
for housing a cellular phone, modem, and data processing system. 

Graphics image files 142 are stored and can be selectively displayed on a 
touchscreen display 26, 28. A zoom function magnifies areas of a 

graphics image 142, such as a fax image, that has been received and 
stored in the personal communicator. When the zoom function is selected, 

the user touches the screen, and a magnification frame 168 or window 
appears. When the user removes his/her finger, the area within the frame 

is magnified. The user can also drag the frame 168 around the screen, 
while still touching the screen, to select a specific area to be 

magnified when the user releases the screen. A pan function allows the 
user to shift the image 170 within a viewing area 142. The user can pan 

the image 170 by touching the display at an initial touch point 188, and 
moving his/her finger keeping it in contact with the screen, to shift the 

touch point to a new touch point 190. Upon releasing the new touch 
point, the image is redrawn in a new position corresponding to the change 

in position between the initial 188 and new 190 touch points.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to the field of personal communicators 
having a variety of data processing and communications functions. More 
particularly, the invention relates to a zoom and pan function for use 
with such a personal communicator. The personal communicator is in the form of a handset having an 
earphone or speaker at one end and a microphone at the other end. The 
speaker and microphone are spaced apart the same distance as the distance 
between an ear and the mouth of an "average" user, to facilitate use of 
the communicator as a cellular phone. A small touchscreen display is 
located between the speaker and the microphone. The display has a fine 
pitch liquid crystal display (LCD) allowing it to be operated as a 
standard CGA with a resolution of 640x200 pixels. The touch sensitive 
display provides a graphic user interface and is used as an input/output 
device for a variety of functions or applications. Within the prior art, particularly that of desktop personal 
computers, it is publicly known to control pan and zoom functions on 
graphic images by positioning a cursor with the aid of a cursor control 
device such as a keyboard, mouse, trackball, pen, etc. With a mouse 
controlled screen, a common zoom function is to click at one corner of 
the area to be magnified, and drag the mouse to another corner. Upon 
release, the delineated area is magnified. Panning is done by moving the 
cursor against the edge of a screen image. U.S. patent 5,187,776- Yanker 
discloses an "IMAGE EDITOR ZOOM FUNCTION" for a personal computer CRT 
display, in which a small viewport window shows an image at a (1x) 
magnification. The viewport is superimposed on a larger display of a 
magnified portion of the image centered about the location of the cursor 
in the viewport. The cursor is also movable in the viewport to pan the 
magnified image. U.S. patent 4,899,292- Montagan et al, discloses a "SYSTEM FOR 
STORING AND RETRIEVING TEST AND ASSOCIATED GRAPHICS". The system 
includes a computer coupled to a terminal having a resistive touchscreen.  
 
A wand is connected to an analog to digital converter. When the wand is 
touched to the screen, it detects a voltage signal that is converted into 
coordinates. The image is magnified by two centered at the point of 
touch. One of the objects of the invention is to provide improved zoom and 
pan functions for a mobile, handheld personal communicator having a small 
touchscreen display actuated in response to being touched by a user's 
finger. Another object of the

<CLAIMS>
A personal communicator (10) comprising: 
   a casing (12) having a size adapted to be held in the hand of a 

user; 
   a touch sensitive display (26, 28) mounted on said casing; 

   first means for displaying a graphics image (143) on said display; 
   second means for displaying a magnification frame (168) on said 

display in response to a user touching said display at a touch point 
(166) with a finger, said frame being located beneath said touch point 

and delineating a portion of said graphics image to be magnified; 
   third means for moving said frame around said display in response 

to sliding said finger around said display and in contact therewith; and 
   fourth means for magnifying said portion of said graphics image 

delineated by said frame, in response to disengaging said finger from 
said display. 
A personal communicator (10) as claimed in claim 1 wherein said 
second means is selectively actuated, and said communicator further 

comprises selectively actuated fifth means for panning said graphics 
image (143) in response to said user touching said display with a finger 

at one point and sliding the finger to another point thereby indicating 
direction and extent of panning. 
A personal communicator (10) as claimed in claim 2 wherein said 
fifth means comprises: 

   seventh means for drawing a symbol (188) on said display indicating 
where the user initially touched said display and for continuously 

redrawing a second symbol (190) beneath the finger as the finger slides 
to other positions; and 

   eighth means for redrawing said graphics image in a new position in 
response to a release of said display at said second symbol. 
A personal communicator (10) as claimed in claim 1 wherein said 
frame (168) and said touch sensitive display (26, 28) have similar 

shapes, said frame having a size smaller than that of said touch 
sensitive display and providing a predetermined magnification ratio. 
A personal communicator (10) as claimed in claim 1 wherein said 
frame (168) and said touch sensitive display (26, 28) have rectangular 

shapes, said frame being displayed on said display beneath the point on 
said overlay touched by the finger.
