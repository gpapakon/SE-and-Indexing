that the connection means between the sensor element and the 

stiffening blade comprise a knuckle joint device oriented along a 
direction that is parallel to that of the stiffening blade, 

constituted of two levers (71, 72) journaled with respect to each 
other about a transverse and longitudinal axis (73), the end of one 

layer being connected to an abutment affixed to one of the laths of 
the stiffening blade, the end of the other lever being connected to 

the other lath, and sensor (25) coming to rest on the central 
portion of the knuckle joint device. 
Device according to claim 3, characterized by the fact 
that the connection means comprise a strip (92) oriented along a 

longitudinal direction, whose central portion is rounded upwardly, 
one of whose ends is fixedly connected to one of the laths of the 

blade, whose other end is fixedly connected to the other lath, and 
whose central convex portion receives the downward vertical forces  

 
captured by the sensor (25). 
Device according to claim 3, characterized by the fact 
that sensor element (25) rests in simple support on that portion of 

the connection means (35, 71, 72, 73, 92) that transmit the thrust 
(P) captured by the sensor element (25) to the two laths (37, 38). 
Device according to claim 6, characterized by the 
fact that in the absence of a vertical thrust of the boot on the 

sensor (25), both laths (37, 38) of the blade are in longitudinal 
support against one another at the level of their adjacent end so 

as to transmit, towards one of the ends of the blade (5), the 
flexional biases of the ski perceived by the other end. 
Device according to claim 1, characterized by the 
fact that the stiffening blade (5) behaves like a monoblock 

assembly along a longitudinal direction and that the connection 
means (65, 66, 63) transform the vertical thrust of the boot into 

a longitudinal force oriented towards a single end of the 
stiffening blade. 
Device according to claim 11, characterized by the 
fact that the connection means between the sensor element and the 

stiffening blade comprise a tipping element (65) with two arms, 
journaled about a transverse and horizontal axis (66) borne by an 

element (14) fixedly connected to base (4), having moreover a 
journal axis (63) with a stiffening blade (5) and a support zone on 

which the sensor transmits the vertical thrust of the boot, such

fiat that the connection means between sensor element (25) and

presence of the boot, the knuckle joint is flattened, which 
generates an initial pre-stress in both portions of the stiffening 

blade, and thus in the absence of the boot, the knuckle joint is

Device according to claim 18, characterized by the 
fact that the journal axis (51) of the two elements (48, 49) of the
