<ABSTRACT>
An improved process for making pigmented, microcellular polyurethane elastomers by reacting a resin component and an isocyanate-terminated prepolymer is disclosed. The resin component includes a polyol and two chain extenders, one of which is 1,3-propanediol or a branched C3-C5 diol. The chain extender combination enables successful elastomer processing throughout a broad range (at least a 5  DEG C) of molding temperatures and surprisingly overcomes pigment-induced problems with processability and physical properties. The process is ideal for making polyurethane shoe soles and midsoles.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a way to improve processability in the
preparation of microcellular elastomers. In particular, the invention improves
the processing characteristics and physical properties of microcellular
elastomers that contain a pigment.Microcellular polyurethane elastomers are well known, as is
illustrated, for example, by U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,728,745 and 5,250,582. These
references and others teach the value of using polyether polyols having very
low unsaturation levels to make the elastomers. In making shoe soles,
these microcellular products are valuable because of their reduced
shrinkage compared with elastomers made with conventional polyols that
have higher unsaturation levels (see column 22 of U.S. Pat. No. 5,728,745).A typical microcellular polyurethane elastomer formulation reacts a
polyol or mixture of polyols with water, an amine blowing catalyst, an
organometallic urethane catalyst, one or more chain extenders, and a
surfactant with an organic polyisocyanate (e.g., TDI, MDI, or the like).
Various processes are known for combining the reactants. In the common
"one-shot" approach, the "B side" components (polyols, surfactants,
catalysts, chain extenders, and water) are pre-mixed before combining and
reacting them with the polyisocyanate ("A side"). Another approach is called
the "prepolymer method." In this method, a prepolymer is prepared, usually
by reacting the polyisocyanate with a portion of the polyols, chain extenders,
or both to give an NCO-terminated intermediate. The NCO-terminated
prepolymer is then reacted with a resin component or "B side" (a mixture of
water, catalysts, surfactant, and the remaining amounts of polyol and/or
chain extender) to produce the microcellular elastomer. A pigment is often included in the formulation. Typical pigments are
carbon black, titanium dioxide, iron oxides, or the like. While pigments are
often a necessary part of the formulation, they can adversely affect both
elastomer processability and physical/mechanical properties. We found that
black pigments (e.g., carbon black) can interfere with processability of an
otherwise acceptable microcellular elastomer formulation. Moreover, when
products can be made, they often lack the required physical properties for
high-performance applications.A possible solution is to use a mixture of chain extenders. While 1,4-butanediol,
ethylene glycol, and diethylene glycol are commonly used as
chain extenders, only one chain extender is normally used. We found that
various mixtures of 1,4-butanediol,
