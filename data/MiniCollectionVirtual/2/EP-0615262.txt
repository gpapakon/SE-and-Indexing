<ABSTRACT>
To provide a non-reducing dielectric ceramic 
composition for multilayer ceramic capacitor, in which 

decrease of specific resistance and shortening of life time 
do not occur due to reduction of dielectric ceramic 

composition even when it is fired in neutral or reducing 
atmosphere and capacitance does not vary extensively due 

to temperature change, the non-reducing dielectric ceramic 
composition according to the present invention comprises 

86.32 to 97.64 mols of BaTiO₃, 0.01 to 10.00 mols of Y₂O₃, 
0.01 to 10.00 mols of MgO, and 0.001 to 0.200 mol of V₂O₅. 

An additive containing 0.01 to 1.0 mol% of at least one or 
more of MnO, Cr₂O₃, or Co₂O₃, and further, an additive 

containing 0.5 to 10.0 mol% of {Ba

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a non-reducing 
dielectric ceramic composition, and in particular to a 
non-reducing dielectric ceramic composition to be used in 
multilayer ceramic capacitor, in which a base metal such as 
nickel is used as internal electrode. With rapid propagation of various types of electronic 
devices, there is a tendency that these devices are 
increasingly produced in compact and lightweight design. 
In particular, this tendency toward compact and lightweight 
design is more remarkable in the electronic devices of 
portable type to be used in camera-integrated video tape 
recorder, portable telephone set, note-book personal 
computer, palm-top computer, etc. In such tendency toward compact and lightweight 
electronic products, the component parts for these devices 
are also increasingly produced in compact and lightweight 
design. The means to mount the electronic components are  
 
also changing from the technique for inserting and soldering 
pins, i.e. electronic parts, to be used in through-hole on 
conventional type printed board to surface mounting 
technology (SMT), i.e. the technique for mounting and 
soldering electronic parts on land of electro-conductive 
pattern on printed board. The electronic parts used in this SMT are generally 
called surface mounting devices (SMD). Not only semiconductor 
components, but also capacitor, resistor, 
inductor, filter, etc. are included in them. Among them, 
small components such as capacitor and resistor are called 
chip components. The most representative of them is multilayer 
ceramic capacitor. Fig. 1 shows a partially cutaway perspective view 
showing structure of a multi layer ceramic capacitor. The multilayer ceramic capacitor 1 is in form of 
rectangular parallelopiped, and terminal electrodes 3 and 4 
are mounted on a pair of opposed surfaces of multilayer 
ceramic capacitor body 1, which is in form of rectangular 
parallelopiped. In the multilayer ceramic capacitor main unit 2, four 
internal electrodes 5, 6, 7 and 8 are formed among laminated 
BaTiO3 dielectric layers 9, 10 and 11, and dielectric  
 
material layers 12 and 13 made of dielectric material are 
laminated on upper surface of the internal electrode and 
lower surface of the internal electrode 8. Every other of the internal electrodes 5, 6, 7 and 8 
are connected to terminal electrodes. That is, the internal 
electrodes 6 and 8 are connected to a terminal electrode 4, 
and the internal electrodes 5 and 7 are connected to another 
terminal electrode 3. As a
