Use of a peptide having the sequences SEQ ID NO 1 -
8 QAPTEQRPGVQE (SEQ ID NO: 1), SYRGTYSTTVTGR (SEQ

ID NO: 2), RTPEYYPNAGLI (SEQ ID NO: 3), PDAVAAPY
(SEQ ID NO: 4), CSDAEGTAVA (SEQ ID NO: 5), TPVPSLE

(SEQ ID NO: 6), LETPTVVPVPS (SEQ ID NO: 7),
TFIPGTNK (SEQ ID NO: 8) or partial sequences

thereof with at least 4 amino acids for the
purification of antibodies against Lp(a) by means

of affinity chromatography, wherein the peptide is
bound to a carrier material on which the antibody

can then be purified in a known way by means of
affinity chromatography.
Use of a peptide having the sequences SEQ ID NO 1 -
8 or partial sequences thereof with at least 4

amino acids as an immunogen for producing
antibodies against Lp(a).
Use of a peptide having the sequences SEQ ID NO 1 -
8 or partial sequences thereof with at least 4

amino acids as a standard in an immunological test
for the quantitative determination of Lp(a).
Use of a peptide having the sequences SEQ ID NO 1 -
8 or partial sequences thereof with at least 4

amino acids as a hapten in a competitive
immunological test. 
Use of a peptide having the sequences SEQ ID NO 1 -
8 or partial sequences thereof with at least 4

amino acids as an Lp(a) hapten in an agglutination
test, wherein at least one peptide having the

sequences SEQ ID NO 1 - 8 is bound to a carrier so
that after incubation of the complex which is thus

formed with antibodies against this hapten an
agglutinate forms whose formation is decreased in

the presence of free Lp(a).
Method for the immunological determination of Lp(a)
by a competitive agglutination test by incubating a

carrier-bound Lp(a) hapten with an antibody against
this hapten and the sample to be analysed and

measuring the signal which occurs in this process
in the presence and absence of the sample to be

analysed, wherein the carrier-bound Lp(a) hapten
contains at least one peptide having the sequences

SEQ ID NO 1 - 8 or partial sequences thereof with

at least 4 amino acids.
Method for the immunological determination of Lp(a)
by incubating an Lp(a)-hapten bound to a label with

an antibody against this hapten and the sample to
be analysed and measuring the signal which occurs

in this process in the presence and absence of the
sample to be analysed, wherein the Lp(a)-hapten

bound to the label contains at least one peptide
having the sequences SEQ ID NO 1 - 8 or partial

sequences thereof with at least 4 amino acids.
Method as claimed in claim 7, wherein it is carried
out according to the FPIA, EMIT or CEDIA technique. 
Process for the purification of antibodies against
Lp(a) by affinity chromatography in which a peptide

according to the invention having the sequences
SEQ ID NO 1 - 8 or partial sequences thereof with

at least 4 amino acids is bound to a carrier
material on which the antibody is then purified in

a known manner.
Process for the production of antibodies against
Lp(a) which have only a low reactivity with LDL

and/or plasminogen in which a peptide having the
sequences SEQ ID NO 1 - 8 or partial sequences

thereof with at least 4 amino acids is used as an
immunogen.
Use of antibodies obtainable by a process as
claimed in claim 9 or 10 for the immunological

determination of Lp(a).
