<ABSTRACT>
An ink jet recording apparatus wherein
recording is effected while a recording head having a

plurality of recording elements arranged in a first
direction is scanningly moved relative to a recording

material in a second direction which is different from
the first direction, the apparatus including scanning

means for scanningly moving relative to the recording
material in the second direction; control means for

controlling driving of the recording head such that
while scanningly moving the recording head in the

second direction, the recording is effected such that
a recording band region which extends in the second

direction and which is recorded using a part of
contiguous recording elements and a non-recording band

region which is not recorded, appears alternately, and
by a different scanning movement, the non-recording

band region is recorded.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a multi-scan
recording method and a high speed recording apparatus,
which can be used in combination to record at a high
speed and a high level of quality, without the
problems which occur when a conventional multi-scan
recording method is used in combination with a high
speed recording apparatus.In recent years, various office automation
business machines such as personal computers or word
processors have come to be widely used, along with
various recording apparatuses for printing out the
data inputted with the use of these machines. Also,
the technologies for printing high quality images at a
high speed with the use of these machines have been
rapidly developed.First, these technologies will be briefly
described.One of the technologies for improving image
quality is a multiple scanning recording.When an image is recorded with the use of a
recording head comprising a plurality of recording
elements, the quality of an image to be recorded 
greatly depends on the performance of the recording
head itself. Slight differences in shape among the
ejection orifices of a recording head or
electrothermal transducers (ejection heaters), which
occur during the recording head manufacturing process,
affect the amount by which ink is ejected from each
ejection orifice, or the direction in which ink is
ejected from each ejection orifice. In other words,
the presence of these differences manifest as
nonuniform density in a final image, reducing the
image quality.An example of such manifestation of
nonuniform density will be described with reference to
Figures 1 and 2. In Figure 1, (a), a referential
character 201 designates a recording head. For the
sake of more simple description, it is assumed that
the recording head 201 comprises eight nozzles 202. A
referential character 203 designates an ink droplet
ejected by a nozzle 202. Ideally, all ink droplets
are the same in terms of the amount (normal amount) by
which they are ejected, and also in terms of the
direction in which they are ejected as illustrated in
Figure 1, (a). When ink is ejected as illustrated in
Figure 1, (a), all the dots formed on a piece of
recording sheet as the ink droplets land on the
recording sheet will be uniform in size as illustrated
in Figure 1, (b). Therefore, an image which does not 
suffer from nonuniform density, as illustrated in
Figure 1, (c), is formed.In reality, however, each nozzle 202 of the
recording head 201 is different in ejection
characteristic from the other. Therefore, if an image
is
