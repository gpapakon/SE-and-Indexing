<ABSTRACT>
An intruder deterrent system of the type which generates a smoke screen and which comprises: intruder detection means (A); smoke screen generating means (2, 3, 5); activating means (8) operatively linked to the intruder detection means and the smoke screen generating means to activate the smoke screen generating means when the intruder detection means is triggered; and smoke screen density regulating means having a smoke screen density sensor (10) to sense the density of the smoke screen and control means (9) responsive to the sensed density to adjust the output of the smoke screen generating means to maintain the smoke screen density at a desired level.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an intruder deterrent system of the type 
which generates a screen of smoke or vapour. Regardless of whether a country's economy is booming or is suffering from a 
recession, the one almost inevitable "growth industry" is crime against 
property. It is widely appreciated that nationwide burglary statistics show an 
almost unerring upward trend. Many companies and individuals have 
endeavoured to develop systems which will reduce the vulnerability of 
unguarded property. Sophisticated modern burglar alarms provide the most 
widespread form of protection, serving to detect the presence of intruders 
and generate audible and/or visible warning signals normally both in the 
vicinity of the property and also at the neighbourhood police station. A 
severe limitation of the audible/visible alarm system is that the triggering of 
the alarm will not automatically deter a burglar and in most circumstances 
there will be a delay of as much as 10 to 15 minutes before the alarm is 
responded to by the owner, the police or other concerned citizens. Others have recognised the inherent drawback of relying upon alarm systems 
alone and have designed devices which will impede or harm the burglar. 
Some of these systems would be regarded as inhumane and others are 
practically undesirable for the damage which they cause to the property or 
the inconvenience to the owner if accidentally triggered.  
 Of the more humane means for deterring or repelling intruders, smoke 
generating devices are amongst the most suitable for the purpose. French 
patent applications numbers FR-A-2 558 625 and FR-A-2 538 147 describe 
burglar detection and alarm systems which liberate noxious gases such as tear 
gas or smoke to deter and/or hinder an intruder. Use of non-toxic smokes in 
anti-theft devices for protecting vehicles is disclosed in United Kingdom 
patent application number GB-A-2 247 094 and Netherlands patent 
application number NL-A-8 402 896. Known types of smoke-generating intruder deterrent system are, however, 
invariably subject to significant problems. The existing systems have difficulty 
in generating a high density smoke screen. Secondly, they have difficulty in 
maintaining that smoke screen, especially should the intruder take action to 
disperse the smoke by, for example, opening or breaking doors or windows to 
the smoke-filled room. It is a general objective of the present invention to overcome these significant 
drawbacks of existing smoke-generating intruder deterrent systems.

<CLAIMS>
An intruder deterrent system of the type which generates a smoke 
screen and which comprises: intruder detection means; smoke screen 

generating means; activating means operatively linked to the intruder 
detecting means and the smoke screen generating means to activate the 

smoke screen generating means when the intruder detection means is 
triggered; and smoke screen density regulating means having a smoke screen 

density sensor to sense the density and to adjust the output of the smoke 
screen generating means to maintain the smoke screen density at a desired 

level. 
A system as Claimed in Claim 1, wherein the smoke screen generating 
means comprises a pump, the duration of operation of which is controllable 

by said control means to regulate the density of the smoke screen. 
A system as Claimed in Claim 1 or Claim 2, wherein the smoke screen 
generating means comprises a storage tank for an aqueous liquid 

composition and one or more delivery pipes extending from the tank to 
deliver the liquid composition to an outlet, the system further comprising 

heating means adjacent the delivery pipe (s) to heat the liquid composition in 
the delivery pipe (s) to thereby convert the liquid composition into a dense 

vapour.  
 
A system Claimed in Claim 3, wherein the aqueous liquid composition 
comprises a mixture of glycol and water. 
A system Claimed in Claim 1, 2, 3 or 4 wherein the smoke screen 
density sensor is housed in a first housing and the smoke screen generating 

means is housed in another housing independent from the said first housing. 
A system as Claimed in Claim 5, wherein the smoke screen density 
sensor and the smoke screen generating means are operatively linked by 

wireless communication means. 
A system as Claimed in Claim 3,4, 5 or 6 wherein the smoke screen 

generating means comprises a pump the rate of operation of which is 
controllable by said control means in dependence upon the temperature of 

the heating means.
