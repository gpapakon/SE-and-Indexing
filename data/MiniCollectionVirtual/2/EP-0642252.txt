<ABSTRACT>
In order to automatically renew data using a modem 
which can simultaneously transmit/receive audio and 

data signal, there is disclosed an apparatus having a 
modem which can simultaneously transmit/receive audio 

and data signal (4 in Fig. 2), a discrimination circuit 
(flow chart in Fig. 5B) for discriminating if a 

communication partner is a specific partner, and a 
control CPU (flow charts in Figs. 4A and 4B) for 

controlling the modem to perform a predetermined data 
communication together with an audio call on the basis 

of the discrimination result of the discrimination 
circuit.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a communication
method and apparatus for performing communications
using data transmission means which can simultaneously
transmit an audio signal and data.In recent years, owing to the downsizing of
computers such as notebook type personal computers and
with the advent of electronic stock control and slip
process systems using, e.g., POS systems, information
in an office can be accessed using a notebook type
personal computer or a special-purpose handy terminal
via a communication line during sales activity (out)
time away from the office. As a result, information
acquisition and stock confirmation at a customer site
can be easily realized, and a quick response to a
customer's need can be attained.An actual sales person connects a notebook type
personal computer or handy terminal to a modem (a
PCMCIA card or unit) and a portable telephone, and
makes a telephone call to a host computer or a personal
computer in his or her office so as to exchange data.
Furthermore, recently, electronic devices such as pen 
computers incorporating a portable telephone function
are commercially available.These electronic devices can be used for managing
personal schedules and address books in addition to
original jobs such as sales activities. Since
information is electrically processed, when personal
information such as a schedule of a particular sales
person directly heard from him or her is stored in a
notebook type personal computer or a portable
electronic device, a third party can access this
information to confirm his or her schedule and/or to
make an appointment on behalf of this sales person.
Furthermore, facsimile (FAX) data which has been
conventionally output onto a paper sheet can be read on
a display screen or can be easily transmitted using a
FAX server or a FAX system using a personal computer.
For this reason, in addition to a one-way access in
which a sales person at a remote location performs
confirmation of a received order or a stock, it is
often required to send data from an office to the
location of the person so as to renew his or hew
personal schedule or to send FAX data to this person.As a background for such requirements, an
environment for personal use of electronic devices has
been established since high-performance, compact, and
low-cost devices have become commercially available,
and the area of spread of information has increased due 
to a widened service area and lower cost of wireless
telephones.A conventional modem (a data or FAX modem)
modulates data to

<CLAIMS>
A communication apparatus comprising:

   data communication means (1, 2, A) capable of
transmitting or receiving audio signals while

substantially simultaneously transmitting or receiving
data signals via a communication path to a network,


characterised by
 further comprising:

discrimination means (8) for discriminating if a new
audio call start instruction is generated after an audio

call with a specific partner using said data
communication means has finished but before communication

of data signals has finished; and
control means (18) for performing predetermined
control of communication path in accordance with the

output of said discrimination means.
Apparatus according to claim 1, wherein the
predetermined control includes the operation of breaking

the communication of the data and disconnecting the
communication path with the specific partner.
Apparatus according to claim 1 , wherein 
the predetermined control includes the operation of

holding the communication path with the specific partner
until the communication of the data is finished, and

informing a user that a new audio call is impossible to
make.
Apparatus according to any preceding claim, wherein
said data communication means comprises means capable of

time divisionally transmitting or receiving said audio
and data signals.
Apparatus according to any preceding claim, wherein
said data communication means comprises means (4, 16) for

modulating said audio and data signals with different
carrier frequencies.
A method of controlling a communication apparatus
including data communication means capable of

transmitting or receiving audio signals while
substantially simultaneously transmitting or receiving

data signals via a communication path to a network, and
characterised in that
 
   said method further comprising the steps of:


discriminating if a new audio call start instruction
is generated after an audio call with a specific partner

by the data communication means has been finished and
before a communication of data is finished; and
performing predetermined control of the
communication path in accordance with a discriminating

result of said discrimination step.
A method according to claim 6, wherein the
predetermined control includes the operation of breaking

the communication of the data and disconnecting the
communication path from the specific partner.
A method according claim 6, wherein the
predetermined control includes the operation of holding

the line with the specific partner until the
communication of the data is finished, and informing a

user that a new audio call is impossible to make.
A method according to any one of claims 6 to 8,
wherein the data communication means comprises means 

capable of time-divisionally transmitting or receiving
said audio and data signals.
A method according to any one of claims 6 to 9,
wherein said audio and data signals are modulated with

different carrier frequencies.
A method according to any one of claims 6 to 10
including:


discriminating whether or not a communication
partner is a specific partner;
confirming a presence/absence of renewed data in the
communication apparatus; and
controlling the data communication means to perform
a data communication associated with the renewed data in

accordance with a discrimination result of said
discrimination step and a confirmation result of said

confirmation step.
