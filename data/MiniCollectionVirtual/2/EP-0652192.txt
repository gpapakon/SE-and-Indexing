<ABSTRACT>
To manufacture a fertiliser and to condition soils, organic domestic wastes including, in any case, sewage sludge, anhydrous calcium oxide, nutrient carriers and an organic material having a large, sorptive specific surface area are mixed and granulated. Type and quantity of the nutrient carriers are determined with the aid of domestic waste analyses and the soils on the one hand and, on the other hand, the nutrient requirements of the crop plants to be treated with the fertiliser. Particularly suitable as the component having a high sorptive specific surface area are, in particular, ultrafinely ground cereal residues with a high gluten content.

<CLAIMS>
A method for producing a fertiliser for cultivated
plants and a soil conditioner by intensive, selective

mixing and subsequent granulation of organic urban waste,
including at least sewage sludge, with organic material

with a specific large sorptive surface area, including at
least finely ground grain residues with a high gluten

content, mineral nutrient carriers and basically active
substances, including at least calcium oxide.
A method according to Claim 1, characterised by the
feature:


of adding sawdust as a further constituent.
A method according to Claim 1, characterised by the
feature:


of adding saw chippings as a further constituent.
A method according to Claim 1, characterised by the
feature:


of adding finely chopped or ground straw as a further
constituent.
A method according to Claim 1, characterised by the
feature:


of adding bark humus as a further constituent.
A method according to any one of Claims 1 to 5,
characterised by the feature:


of replacing a part of the calcium oxide with
magnesium oxide and/or magnesium sulphate for the

purpose of magnesium enrichment.
A method according to any one of Claims 1 to 6,
characterised by the feature: 


of admixing, prior to granulation, urea and/or
ammonium nitrate for the purpose of nitrogen

enrichment.
A method according to any one of Claims 1 to 7,
characterised by the feature:


of admixing, prior to granulation, mono, di and/or
tricalcium phosphate for the purpose of phosphorus

enrichment.
A method according to Claim 8, characterised by the
feature:


of adding precipitated phosphates from waste water
purification.
A method according to any one of Claims 1 to 9,
characterised by the feature:


of admixing, prior to granulation, potassium chloride
and/or potassium sulphate for the purpose of potassium

enrichment.
A method according to any one of Claims 1 to 10,
characterised by the feature:


of admixing, prior to granulation, calcium sulphate
for the purpose of sulphur enrichment and to improve

granulation.
A method according to Claim 11, characterised by the
feature:


of adding calcium sulphate in the form of gypsum from
flue gas desulphurisation plants.

manganese, molybdenum, cobalt, boron and/or zinc in

the form of non-phytotoxic compounds for the purpose
micronutrient enrichment.
A method according to any one of Claims 1 to 13,
characterised by the feature:


of admixing, prior to granulation, mineralisation
and/or nitrification inhibitors to adjust the

availability of organically bound nitrogen.
A method according to any one of Claims 1 to 14,
characterised by the features:


of screening, after homogenisation and granulation,
all the constituents according to granule size,
of returning excessively coarse and excessively fine
granules to the circuit.
A method according to any one of Claims 1 to 15,
characterised by the feature:


that the mineral nutrient carriers and/or basically
active substances can be fed individually or else

already premixed in combination, prior to granulation.
A method according to any one of Claims 1 to 16,
characterised by the features:


of adjusting the granule diameter above 0 mm to 20 mm,
of adapting the water saturation of the granules at
approximately 0 to 60 % by weight of the respective

application range.
