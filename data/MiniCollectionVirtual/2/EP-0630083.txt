<ABSTRACT>
An optical modulating and amplifying apparatus 
includes an optical amplifier 3 and a modulator 4. In the 

apparatus, an input optical signal S1 and an excited light SP 
are combined with each other by an optical mixer 31 to 

produce an output light signal. The excited light SP from a 
laser diode 40 is sensed by a photodiode 41. A bias and an 

amplitude of the sense signal are respectively sensed by a 
means value sensor 51 and a modulation signal sensor 52. A 

modulation degree of the excited light SP is computed by a 
divider 54. A control signal to develop a predetermined 

modulation degree is delivered from a control signal generator 
45 to a variable gain amplifier 43. In response to the 

control signal, the amplifier 43 controls the amplitude of 
the oscillation signal from an oscillator 44. A laser diode 

driver 42 adds a bias to the oscillation signal to drive the 
laser diode 40. The modulation degree is kept unchanged 

regardless of variation in an output level of the excited 
light so as to achieve the modulation with a high signal-to-noise 

ratio.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an optical 
modulating and amplifying apparatus, and in particular, to an 
optical modulating and amplifying apparatus in which a 
modulation signal is superimposed onto a signal light. Heretofore, a conventional optical modulating and 
amplifying apparatus includes. as shown in Fig. 1. an optical 
amplifier 1 including an optical mixer 11 for mixing an input 
light signal S1 to undergo modulation with exciting light 
SP undergone modulation and an optical fiber 12 using erbium. In addition to the optical mixer 11 comprising the optical 
amplifier 1, there is disposed a modulator 2 for 
supplying the exciting light SP to the mixer 11. The 
modulator 2 includes a laser diode 20 for producing exciting 
light. a laser diode driving circuit 21 for supplying a bias 
signal to the laser diode 20, and an oscillator 22 for 
producing and delivering a modulation signal to the driver 21. In the optical amplifier modulator above, the 
modulation signal from the oscillator 22 and the bias signal 
from the driver 21 are used to create a driver current. The 
current drives the laser diode 20 to emit exciting light SP. 
The modulated light SP is then fed to the mixer 11 to be 
superimposed onto the input optical signal S1. The resultant 
signal is propagated through the fiber 12 to be outputted 
therefrom as an optical signal S2. Namely, the modulated 
signal SP is used to alter the gain of the optical amplifier 1  
 
for the modulation of the input optical signal S1. However, in the conventional apparatus, since the 
modulated output signal delivered from the oscillator 22 has 
substantially a fixed output level. variation in the output 
level of the exciting light SP from the diode 20 causes the 
modulation degree to be also changed. In a case where the 
degree of modulation is increased. the modulation signal 
becomes noise of the signal undergone the superimposition 
and hence the signal-to-noise (S/N) ratio of the signal is 
deteriorated. That is, the contents of the input light 
signal S1 is influenced from the exciting signal SP. On the 
other hand, when the modulation degree is decreased, there 
appears another problem that the signal superimposed onto the 
input signal S1 cannot be easily sensed. Referring now to the drawings, the problem above will be 
further described. As can be seen from Fig. 2A, the exciting 
light SP1 is a signal having a direct-current (dc) level P1. 
Using the dc level P1 as a bias, a modulation signal fm (with 
an amplitude P0) from the oscillator 22
