<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to novel contrast agents, more
particularly to new gas-containing or gas-generating
contrast agents of use in diagnostic imaging.It is well known that ultrasonic imaging comprises a
potentially valuable diagnostic tool, for example in
studies of the vascular system, particularly in
cardiography, and of tissue microvasculature. A variety
of contrast agents has been proposed to enhance the
acoustic images so obtained, including suspensions of
solid particles, emulsified liquid droplets, gas bubbles
and encapsulated gases or liquids. It is generally
accepted that low density contrast agents which are easily
compressible are particularly efficient in terms of the
acoustic backscatter they generate, and considerable
interest has therefore been shown in the preparation of
gas-containing and gas-generating systems.Initial studies involving free gas bubbles generated
invivo by intracardiac injection of physiologically
acceptable substances have demonstrated the potential
efficiency of such bubbles as contrast agents in
echocardiography; such techniques are severely limited in
practice, however, by the short lifetime of the free
bubbles. Interest has accordingly been shown in methods
of stabilising gas bubbles for echocardiography and other
ultrasonic studies, for example using emulsifiers, oils,
thickeners or sugars, or by entraining or encapsulating
the gas or a precursor therefor in a variety of polymer
systems, e.g. as porous gas-containing polymer
microparticles or as gas "microballoons" encapsulated by
polymer coatings.Thus, for example, WO 80/02365 discloses the use of
gelatin encapsulated gas microbubbles for enhancing
ultrasonic images. Such microbubbles do not, however,
exhibit adequate stability at the dimensions preferred for 
use in echocardiography (1-10 µm) in view of the extreme
thinness of the encapsulating coating.US-A-4774958 discloses the use of microbubble
dispersions stabilised by encapsulation in denatured
protein, e.g. human serum albumin. Such systems permit
the production of microbubble systems having a size of
e.g. 2-5 µm but still do not permit efficient
visualisation of the left heart and myocardium. The use
of such protein-derived agents may also create problems
with regard to potential allergenic reactions.EP-A-0327490 discloses, interalia, ultrasonic
contrast agents comprising a microparticulate synthetic
biodegradable polymer containing a gas or volatile fluid
(i.e. having a boiling point below 60°C) in free or bonded
form. Representative synthetic
