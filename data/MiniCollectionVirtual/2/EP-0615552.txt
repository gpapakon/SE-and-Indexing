Process for coating of substrate bodies with hard 
substances by using a corona effect activated CVD-process 

at temperatures above 300°C and pressures below 
10000 Pa, in a cage surrounding the substrate body or 

bodies on all sides, and through the inner space of 
which a suitable reactive mixture is passed whereby on 

the inner surface of the cage facing the substrate body 
a corona discharge border is produced, and the substrate 

body is connected electrically conductive with 
the voltage source producing the corona discharge 

border. 
Process according to claim 1, characterized in that the 
corona discharge is produced on the inner surface of 

the cage by a pulsed direct current. 
Process according to one of claims 1 or 2, 
characterized in that the substrate body is heated to 

temperatures up to 1100°C, preferably between 400 to 
600°C and/or that a pressure of at least 100 Pa up to 

1000 Pa is set in the reaction vessel. 
System consisting of a device for the coating with hard 
substance by means of a corona effect activated CVD 

process and at least one substrate body, the device 
having a reaction vessel provided with at least one gas 

inlet (11) and at least one gas outlet connected with a 
pump, in the reaction vessel interior at least one 

cage (13) formed as an electrode and connected with a 
voltage source is arranged, said cage surrounds the 

substrate body or bodies (14) on all sides whereby the 
substrate body or bodies are connected electrically 

conductive with the voltage source (17) which produces 
the corona discharge border at the cage (13).  

 
System according to claim 4, characterized in that the 
cage (13) is formed substantially spherical. 
System according to one of claims 4 or 5, characterized 
in that the cage has a perforation degree, i.e. a ratio 

of the openings to the total inner cage surface of 10 
to 60 %, preferably of 30 to 40 %. 
System according to one of claims 4 to 6, characterized 
in that the ratio of the perforated inner surface of 

the cage (13) to the surface of the substrate body (14) 
or the substrate bodies (14) is higher than 4 or that 

the ratio of the inner surface of cage (13) covered 
with a corona discharge (20) to the surface of the substrate 

body or bodies is higher than 4. 
System according to one of claims 4 to 7, characterized 
in that the surface to be coated of the substrate body 

or bodies (14) are arranged at a distance of at least 
5 mm, preferably 10 mm or more from the inner cage surface. 
System according to one of claims 4 to 8, characterized 
in that in the reaction vessel (10) several preferably 

interconnected cages (13) are arranged. 
System according to one of claims 4 to 9, characterized 
in that the gas supply line (11) and/or the 

openings (15) directed towards the inside of the cage 
is/are oriented or arranged so that the inflowing gas 

is guided towards the inside of the cage.
