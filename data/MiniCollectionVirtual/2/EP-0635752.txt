<ABSTRACT>
The present invention provides an original 
conveying apparatus (A) comprising original stacking means (7), 

separation means (12) for separating the stacked originals 
from an upper side and for supplying the separated 

original, convey means (2) for conveying the separated 
originals to pass them through a reading portion and 

holding the originals in page sequence, drive means (22) for 
rotating the convey means normally or reversely, 

discharge means for returning the original to the 
original stacking means, and control means (36) for 

controlling the drive means, the discharge means and 
the separation means so that any original is selected 

and set on the reading portion.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an original 
conveying apparatus, and more particularly, it relates 
to an original conveying apparatus wherein originals 
separated from an original stack one by one from the 
uppermost one are held and conveyed by a conveying and 
holding means in page sequence, and, in particular, 
the present invention relates to an original conveying 
apparatus which can be mounted on an overhead projector 
(OHP) for projecting an image of an original onto a 
screen. An example of a conventional original conveying 
apparatus which can be mounted on an overhead projector 
(OHP) will be explained with reference to Fig. 7. 
A convey film 51 and a hold-down film 52 serve to hold 
and pinch an original therebetween, and these films are 
elongated transparent films each having a width greater 
than a width of the original. The convey film 51 on which the original is 
rested serves to move the original to the left as the 
film is shifted in a film winding direction. The hold-down 
film 52 serves to hold down an upper surface of 
the original against the convey film 51 to prevent  
 
the original from curling and damaging. Further, frame 
marks are formed on an edge portion of the convey film 
51 at a predetermined interval. By detecting such 
frame marks by a frame detection sensor 53, a desired 
original is positioned on an exposure portion. One end of the elongated convey film 51 and one 
end of the elongated hold-down film 52 are attached to 
a first take-up means 54 so that these films can be 
wound around the first take-up means. As shown in Fig. 
7, the first take-up means is arranged at the right of 
a reading area of the exposure portion 202 of an OHP 
apparatus 201 and comprises a first convey roll 54a on 
which the convey film 51 is wound and a first hold-down 
roll 54b on which the hold-down film 52 is wound. 
These rolls are rotatably mounted between front and 
rear frames. Incidentally, as shown in Fig. 7, a 
positional relation between the first convey roll 54a 
and the first hold-down roll 54b is selected so that the 
first convey roll 54a is disposed below the first hold-down 
roll 54b. The other ends of the elongated convey film 51 
and hold-down film 52 are attached to a second take-up 
means 55 so that these films can be wound around the 
second take-up means. As shown in Fig. 7, the second 
take-up means is arranged at the left of the reading 
area of the exposure portion 202 of the OHP apparatus 
201 and comprises a second convey roll 55a on which the  
 
convey film
