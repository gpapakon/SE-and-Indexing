. in the Porifera class 
Demospongiae has been found to contain two new and 

exceptionally active cell (human cancer) growth 
inhibitors named spongistatin 2 and spongistatin 3. 

A bright colored Southwest Indian Ocean sponge 

Spirastrella
spinispirulifera

to contain related human cancer cell growth 

inhibitors named spongistatin 4 and spongistatin 6. 
A method of treating human cancer cells with 

spongistatin 1, spongistatin 2, spongistatin 3, 
spongistatin 4 and spongistatin 6 is also 

disclosed. The approximate mean GI₅₀ of the

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to the discovery and 
isolation of four new structurally related 
compositions of matter. Two of these compounds are 
constituents of an Eastern Indian Ocean marine 
sponge of the genus Spongia herein denominated as 
"spongistatin 2" and "spongistatin 3". Two other 
compounds were extracted from the marine sponge 
Spirastrella spinispirulifera (Class Demospongiae, 
Order Hadromerida, Family Spirastrellidae). These 
compounds are denominated herein as "spongistatin 
4" and "spongistatin 6". The new macrocyclic 
lactones were found to be remarkably potent and 
specific against the human cancer cell lines in the 
U.S. National Cancer Institute's panel. A great number of ancient marine invertebrate 
species in the Phyla Bryozoa, Mollusca and Porifera 
were well established in the earth's oceans over 
one billion years ago. Certainly such organisms 
have explored trillions of biosynthetic reactions 
in their evolutionary chemistry to reach present 
levels of cellular organization, regulation and 
defense. Marine sponges have changed minimally in 
physical appearance for nearly 500 million years, 
suggesting a very effective chemical evolution in 
response to changing environmental conditions for 
at least that time period. Some recognition of the 
potential for utilizing biologically potent marine 
animal constituents was recorded in Egypt about 
2,700 BC, and by 200 BC sea hare extracts were  
 
being used in Greece for medicinal purposes. Such 
considerations, combined with the general 
observation that marine organisms (especially 
invertebrates and sharks) rarely develop cancer, 
led to the first systematic investigation of marine 
animal and plant anticancer constituents. By 1968 ample evidence had been obtained, based on 
the U. S. National Cancer Institute's key 
experimental cancer systems, that certain marine 
organisms would provide new and structurally novel 
antineoplastic and/or cytotoxic agents. Analogous 
considerations suggested that marine organisms 
could also provide effective new drugs for other 
severe medical challenges, such as viral diseases. 
Furthermore, marine organisms were expected to 
contain potentially useful drug candidates (and 
biochemical probes) of unprecedented structural 
types, that would have eluded discovery by 
contemporary techniques of medicinal chemistry. 
Fortunately, some of these expectations have been 
realized in the intervening period. Illustrative 
of these successes are the discoveries of the 
bryostatins, dolastatins, and
