<ABSTRACT>
For therapeutic use, and particularly for promoting growth or weight gain in livestock under intensive husbandry, a formulation comprises a first microorganism capable of producing lactic acid in the gastrointestinal tract of the animal and a second microorganism capable of producing a bactericide to which the microorganisms are resistant. The formulation may also comprise the means for digesting fibre and/or lactoperoxidase.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a formulation of
microorganisms suitable for administration to an animal,
for therapeutic purposes or to promote growth, weight gain
or another desirable aim in commercial livestock.In the production and growth of all animals, it is
possible to identify periods of vulnerability to infection
of the gastrointestinal tract (GIT), e.g. parturition and
weaning, and other periods of a traumatic nature that are
generally referred to as "stress". During these periods of
change, the first manifestation of deleterious effects
occurring is usually a loosening of bowel function and
diarrhoea. In extreme cases, such symptoms can lead to the
onset of dehydration, and ultimately death. The effect of
sub-acute infections is a marked check in the animals'
growth, that can even lead to a loss in weight.In the wild, although the periods of "stress" occur,
they prove less traumatic, as seen by the reduced
occurrence of the symptoms described above. By contrast,
under conditions of normal and intensive husbandry, the
effects of "stress" may be both intensified and prolonged,
and additional traumas such as maternal separation,
transport, human handling and unusual environments may be
introduced.In current practice of intensive husbandry in pigs,
antibiotics such as tylosin are added to the animal feed to
prevent or reduce GIT infections. Growth of the animals is
thus promoted, when compared with untreated controls, by
preventing the onset of the debilitating effects of the GIT
infections. The addition of copper to the feed is also
common practice, but the mechanism of action is uncertain.
It has however been shown that the presence of copper,
under certain conditions, can lead to the production of 
H2O2, which is also produced by the action of bacteria in
the GIT.US-A-4808417 discloses a feed additive for fish
cultivation, comprising a proteinase, a lipase, and a
mixture of lactic acid-producing bacteria, saccharificating
bacteria and butyric acid-producing bacteria. Examples of
butyric acid-producing bacteria are Clostridium butyricum
and Clostridium acetobutyricum.According to a first aspect of the present invention,
a method for the promotion of growth or weight gain in a
farm animal other than fish, comprises administering to the
animal a first microorganism capable of producing lactic
acid in the gastrointestinal tract of the animal and a
second microorganism capable of producing a bactericide to
which the microorganisms are resistant.According to a further aspect of the invention, a
