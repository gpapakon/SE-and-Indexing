<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an optical connector
in which optical fibers are positioned and fixed and optical
connection is realized by using guide pins in optical
communication, and particularly to an optical connector in
which connection guide pins and optical fibers are positioned
and fixed by V-grooves provided in the optical connector.Fig. 1 shows an end surface view of a conventional
optical connector for multiple coated optical fibers, in which
a substrate with V-grooves is subjected to insert-molding so as
to be integrated with a molding resin portion.A substrate 1 is prepared so as to provide optical
fiber guide grooves 3 and two guide pin grooves 4 arranged on
opposite sides of a group of the optical fiber guide grooves 3
on an upper surface thereof. An upper plate 2 is bonded over
the optical fiber guide grooves 3 of the substrate 1 in such a
manner that upper surfaces of the guide pin grooves 4 are left
to be entirely opened. By use of a metal mold, molding guide
pins are subjected to insert-molding within the guide pin
grooves 4 so that a resin molding portion 9 is formed to cover
the substrate 1 and the upper plate 2. At the time of coupling, the optical fibers are
positioned and held in the optical fiber guide grooves 3, the
end surfaces of the optical fibers are polished, and then the
guide pins 7 are inserted into two guide pin holes 6 formed
through molding respectively so that the optical fibers are
positioned and coupled with each other. The coupling loss was
about 0.25 dB in average in single-mode optical fibers.In the conventional optical connector shown in Fig. 1,
the guide pins 7 inserted into the guide pin holes 6
respectively are pressed by the molding resin portion 9 into
the guide pin grooves 4 of the substrate 1, so that
highly-accurate centering can be realized. However, there has
been a problem that the guide pin holes 6 may be transformed as
shown by dotted lines 6' by generation of shrinkage distortion
of the molding resin after insert molding, so that the
V-contact operation force of the guide pins 7 can not be
sufficiently generated to make it difficult to realize optical
connector coupling having a low loss not higher than 0.1 dB in
single-mode optical fibers.Fig. 2 is a perspective view of another conventional
optical connector for collectively connecting a plurality of
coated optical fibers by using guide pins. An optical
connector 50 is formed of epoxy resin through molding and has
such a structure that optical fiber holes 5 are arranged in one
row in the
