<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to the biosynthetic preparation of
carbohydrate monoesters, which preparation is selective for
the preparation of one or more positional isomers of such
monoester. More particularly, this invention relates to the
preparation of sucrose monoesters by selective hydrolysis of
specific components of mixtures of sucrose monoesters by
contacting such mixtures with specific enzymes. In addition,
this invention relates to the use of monoesters made by the
process of the present invention as excipients in
pharmaceuticals, foods, cosmetics or as emulsifiers, coating
agents, antiseptic agents and the like.Carbohydrate monoesters, and specifically sucrose
monoesters, are used commercially as food emulsifying agents,
as coating agents and as excipients in pharmaceutical,
cosmetic and other products. Commercially available
monoesters, typically made by chemical means, comprise
mixtures of positional isomers or are often mixed with an
amount of di- and tri-esters (usually at about 20% of the
mixture). However, there is no commercially feasible
synthesis that selectively yields pure monoesters, that is
monoesters which substantially comprise one positional isomer
of a monoester such as the 6-O, 6'-O or 1'-O monoester. If
commercially available mixtures made by chemical means could
be resolved such that specific isomers of the monoesters could
be isolated, it would be advantageous since by selective
isolation of the isomers the monoesters may have unique
properties for food and cosmetic uses compared to the
mixtures.Therefore, there is a need for a process for the
resolution of regio-selective isomers of carbohydrate
monoesters, and particularly sucrose monoester. It is an
object of this invention to provide a method to resolve a 
mixture of carbohydrate monoesters obtained by chemical
reaction into monoesters of defined structure which comprise
substantially the 6-O-ester, the 1'-O-ester or the 6'-O-ester.This invention relates to a regio-selective method for
the resolution of a mixture of carbohydrate monoesters, the
method comprising incubating the ester mixture in an
appropriate solvent system with one or more regio-selective
enzymes and purifying the desired monoester.In an embodiment of this invention, the carbohydrate
monoester (or mixture thereof) is a sucrose or glucose
monoester of a fatty acid of at least about 8 carbon atoms in
length, and preferably about 8-22 carbon atoms. Most
preferred are monoesters of a fatty acid of about 8-18 carbon
atoms. Specifically preferred embodiments of
