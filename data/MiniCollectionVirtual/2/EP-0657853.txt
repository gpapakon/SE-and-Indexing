<ABSTRACT>
The electronic postage meter control system includes 
a printing unit which is responsive to control signals 

from a control circuit. The control circuit includes a 
programmable microprocessor (13) in bus communication 

with memory units (NVM1-3) for accounting for the postage 
printed by the printing means. The microprocessor (13) 

is also in bus communication with an application specific 
integrated circuit (15). The integrated circuit has an 

address decoding module (28) for generating a unique 
combination of control signals in response to a 

respective address placed on the bus by the 
microprocessor (13). Memory units (NVM1-3) are 

responsive to a chip select control signal to enable 
writing to the respective memory units (NVM1-3). The 

integrated circuit also includes a non-volatile memory 
access delay circuit for causing the chip select signal 

from the address decoding module enabling those memory 
units requiring additional access time to stay active for 

the additional time.

CONTROL SYSTEM FOR AN ELECTRONIC POSTAGE METER HAVING A 
PROGRAMMABLE APPLICATION SPECIFIC INTEGRATED CIRCUIT. 
The contents of all these applications are incorporated 
herein by reference.  In electronic postage metering machines, and like 
devices, it is customary to develop a specific 
microcontroller system for each model of postage meters 
to accommodate the unique control requirements of each 
meter model. Conventionally, a microcontroller system, 
of the type customarily used in postage metering 
applications, is comprised of a programmable 
microprocessor in bus communication with a read-only 
memory (ROM) or program memory, random access memory 
(RAM), non-volatile memories (NVMs) and an application 
specific integrated circuit (ASIC). Conventionally, the 
ASIC chip generates the chip select signals and write 
enable signal in order to write to the NVMs pursuant to 
address instructions from the microprocessor. One of the 
factors which have predicated customization of the
