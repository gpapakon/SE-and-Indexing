<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method according to the 
preamble of Claim 1 for producing a catalyst. A catalyst is made up of a carrier structure, or body, which is 
a honeycomb made of metal or a ceramic material and containing 
channels. On the surface of the carrier structure there is a 
layer of support the purpose of which is, on the one hand, to 
serve as a base for affixing the catalytically active agents 
and, on the other hand, to increase the catalytic surface area. 
Noble metals such as platinum and rhodium are commonly used as 
catalytically active agents. When a metal body is used, the metal foil is annealed at a high 
temperature before the application of the support, since thereby 
an oxide layer is formed on the surface, the layer thickening 
as atmospheric oxygen and the diffusing metals react with 
each other. Thus, for example, the oxide layer forming on the 
surface of aluminum/chromium steels consists almost entirely of 
Al2O3. The thickness of the support layer is in general 10 - 40 µm, 
and its mass is 2 - 30 % by weight, calculated of the total 
weight of the catalyst. Gamma-alumina is commonly used as the 
support. Beryllium oxide, zirconium oxide, magnesium oxide, 
silica, ceria or titanium oxide may also used for the support 
layer. The support layer is prepared by slurrying the alumina 
in water and by adjusting its pH to the acid side. Thereafter 
the auxiliary substances such as Ce are added to the slurry. 
The slurry is ground, whereafter the support is applied to the 
body surface, and then dried and calcined. Additives are used in the support in order to improve the properties 
of the support. The most important additive is cerium, 
which on the one hand stabilizes the support thermally and on  
 
the other hand serves to store oxygen on the catalyst surface. 
Cerium also serves as a catalytic promotor in redox reactions. 
CeO2 promotes the water-gas shift reaction and, in oxidizing 
conditions, stores oxygen for use in conditions in which there 
is too little oxygen. By thermal stabilization is meant that 
cerium inhibits or retards changes in crystal structure otherwise 
occurring in alumina at high temperatures (> 800 °C). 
Transformation of gamma-alumina to alpha-phase is a phenomenon 
detrimental in terms of the functioning of the catalyst, since 
it reduces the specific surface area and thereby lowers catalytic 
activity. The support layer may also be stabilized by 
using, for example, La, Nd and/or Zr. Cerium is added to the support slurry most commonly by
