<DESCRIPTION>
 METHOD FOR INHIBITING SELECTIN-DEPENDENTADHESION OF LEUKOCYTES AND PLATELETSBY O-GLYCOSYLATION MODIFICATIONBACKGROUND OF THE INVENTIONSelectins are a family of molecules, including ELAM-1 (endothelial leukocyte adhesion molecule-1) , GMP-140 (CD62; PADGEM) and LECCAM-1 (Mel-14 in mice, Leu-8 in humans) , which primarily mediate adhesion of blood cells and tumor cells expressing specific carbohydrate epitopes to endothelial cells (EC's) and to platelets. The molecules share a structural motif consisting of an N-terminal lectin domain (carbohydrate-binding domain) , an epidermal growth factor (EGF) domain, a complement-regulatory sequence repeat, a transaembrane domain and a cytoplasmic C-terminal domain. The lectin domains of ELAM-1 and GMP-140 bind to the carbohydrate structures sialosyl-Lex (SLex) (Lowe et al.. Cell, 61: 475, 1990; Phillips et al., Science, 250: 1130, 1990; Polley et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci., U.S.A., 88: 6224, 1991) and sialosyl-Leβ (SLea) (Berg et al., J. Biol. Chem. , 266: 14869, 1991; Takada et al., Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun., 179: 713, 1991; Handa et al., Biochem, Biophys. Res. Commun., in press). Because SLe* and SLea are tumor-associated antigens (Hakomori, Adv. Cancer Res., 5_2: 331, 1989), selectins likely play important roles in defining 

 tumor cell adhesion to platelets and EC 's and in initiating metastasis (Hakomori, Curr. Opin. Immunol . , 2.: 646 , 1991) . Interaction of leukocytes recruited to an inflammatory locus with activated vasculature endothelial cells, or with activated platelets, is an initial event in inflammation. In general, however, the number of recruited leukocytes is excessive resulting in, for example, infiltration of leukocytes through the vessel walls into surrounding tissue or development of emboli and microemboli resulting from the aggregation of leukocytes with platelets or other blood cell components. Interaction between tumor cells and activated platelets or activated vasculature endothelial cells can result in events similar to those described above for leukocytes, namely adhesion and development of emboli and microemboli. Adhesion of tumor cells to endothelial cells and extravasation or extravascularization of tumor cells are regarded as early events of metastasis. In the adhesion of either leukocytes or tumor cells to endothelial cells or platelets, interleukin-1 (IL-1) is produced by leukocytes. IL-1 induces the expression of ELAM-1. Many tuuor cells produce TGF0 or TNFα which activate endothelial cells and induce expression of
