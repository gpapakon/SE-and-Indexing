<ABSTRACT>
Broad-band, pulsed optical light sources are required for optical telecommunication (information transmission). It is, inter alia, intended to use fibre ring lasers (1) for this purpose. In this case it is necessary for the fibre ring laser (1) to be synchronised with an external clock pulse. The synchronisation is carried out with a fibre ring laser (1), actively mode-locked according to the invention, in the ring resonator (6), the optical wavelength of which laser is adjusted for the purpose of synchronisation.

An actively mode-locked fibre laser (1) for the 
generation of short pulses, with an optical amplifier (5), 

a fibre resonator (6), a modulator (2) as clock input and a 
signal output (A), wherein the pulse repetition frequency 

of the short pulses is synchronised with an external clock, 
supplied via the clock input (2), by means (8) for changing 

the optical path length (L) of the fibre resonator (6), 
where the means (8) for changing the optical path length 

(L) are connected to a control device (10) and the control 
signal for the means (8) for changing the optical path 

length (L) is derived from the output signal of the fibre 
laser (1), where the control device (10) contains an opto-electrical 

transducer (11), an electrical amplifier (12) 
and a controller (13), the opto-electrical transducer (11) 

is connected via a coupler (9) to the signal output (A) in 
order to convert a part of the output signal into an 

electrical signal, the electrically converted signal, which 
contains an interference signal as a gauge of the degree of 

synchronisation, is fed across the amplifier (12), the 
interference signal is compensated to a minimum in the 

controller (13), and the control signal for the means (8) 
for changing the optical path length is thereby derived 

from the compensation signal, characterised in that the 
electrical amplifier (12) has the form of a phase-sensitive 

amplifier and for the phase-sensitive rectification of the 
electrically converted signal is driven by a wobble signal, 

that in the controller (13) either the amplitude or the 
integral mean energy value of the short pulses is adjusted 

to its maximum value or the duration of the short pulses is 
adjusted to its minimum value, and the control signal, 

which is modulated with the wobble signal, is thereby 
generated.  

 
A fibre laser according to Claim 1, characterised in 
that the means (8) for changing the optical path length (L)
