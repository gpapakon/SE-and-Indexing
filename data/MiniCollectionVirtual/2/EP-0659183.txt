<DESCRIPTION>
 Heteroaryl compounds used as pharmaceuti cal sThis invention relates to the use of compounds as 5-HT4 receptor antagonists in the treatment of gastrointestinal disorders, CNS disorders and/or cardiovascular disorders, and to certain novel compounds having 5-HT4 receptor antagonist activity.European Journal of Pharmacology 146 (1988), 187-188, and Naunyn- Schmiedeberg's Arch. Pharmacol. (1989) 340:403-410, describe a non classical 5-hydroxytryptamine receptor, now designated the 5-HT4 receptor, and that ICS 205-930, which is also a 5-HT3 receptor antagonist, acts as an antagonist at this receptor.Some 5-HT3 receptor antagonists have been disclosed as of potential use in the treatment of certain aspects of irritable bowel syndrome (see EP-A- 189002 (Sandoz Limited) and EP-A-201165 (Beecham Group p.Lc)). -HT3 receptor interactions which are of potential use in the treatment of IBS are those associated either with the visceral pain and abnormal perception of sensation aspects of this disease, or they are related to the ability of some 5-HT3 receptor antagonists to cause constipation in volunteers.Some 5-HT3 receptor antagonists have been disclosed as of potential use in the treatment of gastrointestinal disorders associated with upper gut motility [see EP-A-226266 (Glaxo Group Ltd.) and EP-A-189002 (Sandoz Limited)]. 5-HT3 receptor antagonists are also well known antiemetics, such as ondansetron, granisetron and tropisetron (see Drugs of the Future 1989, 14 (9) p.875 - F.D. King and G.J. Sanger). WO 91/16045 (SmithKline and French Laboratories Limited) describes the use of cardiac 5-HT4 receptor antagonists in the treatment of atrial arrhythmias and stroke.EP-A-36269 (Beecham Group p. c.) describes a group of compounds of potential use in the treatment of gastrointestinal motility disorders. WO 92/10494 (Beecham Group p.Lc.) describes 5-HT3 receptor antagonists derived from a benzoic acid nucleus 2,3 disubstituted by alkylenedioxy. WO 93/05038 (SmithKline Beecham p.Lc.) describes 5-HT4 receptor antagonists derived from a benzoic acid nucleus.EP-A-501322 (Glaxo Group Limited) describes indole derivatives having 5-HT4 antagonist activity.It has now been discovered that certain novel compounds have 5-HT4 receptor antagonist properties;When used herein, 'treatment' includes prophylaxis as appropriate. 

 Accordingly, the present invention provides a compound of formula (I) and pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof, and the use of a compound of formula (I) or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof:(I)
