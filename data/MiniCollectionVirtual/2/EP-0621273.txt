<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to compounds having a
cyclopenta[b]benzofuran ring for use as therapeutic drugs
having pharmacological action such as platelet coagulation
inhibitory action. Such drugs are known from EP-A-0084856,
which discloses a range of prostaglanin I2 derivatives which
are 2-hydroxy-2,3,3a,3b-tetrahydro-1H-5-carboxyalkyl (or
carboxyalkenyl)-cyclopenta[b]benzofurans substituted in the
1-position by an alkyl chain containing alkynyl
unsaturation, substituted by a hydroxy or an acyloxy group
and optionally including ethylenic unsaturation. The
compounds have platelet aggregation-inhibiting, hypotensive,
anti-ulcer and other activities.It is also known that platelet coagulation can be
caused by the presence of thromboxane A2.Thromboxane A2 (TXA2), discovered by Samuelsson et al.
in 1975, has strong platelet coagulating action and smooth
muscle contracting action (see Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.
U.S.A., vol. 72, p. 2994 (1975)). Thromboxane A2 is
considered to be one of the causes which produces disorders
such as ischemic heart disorders including angina pectoris
and myocardial infarction, as well as cerebrovascular
disease and bronchial asthma as a result of these actions.
Thus, suppression of the action of thromboxane A2 is
effective for treatment of disorders such as ischemic heart
disorders including angina pectoris and myocardial
infarction, cerebrovascular disease and bronchial asthma.
Thromboxane A2 receptor antagonists have been reported to be
drugs which suppress the action of thromboxane A2 (see
Circulation, vol. 81, suppl. I, 1-69 (1990)).Thromboxane A2 receptor antagonists have attracted
attention as therapeutic drugs for disorders caused by
thromboxane A2, and a thromboxane A2 receptor antagonist is
sought which has both high activity and long duration.As a result of searching for a thromboxane A2 receptor 
antagonist having a novel structure, we have found a
sulfonamide derivative that has a cyclopenta[b]benzofuran
ring as a compound which has powerful thromboxane A2
receptor antagonistic action. Thus, the present invention
provides a sulfonic acid derivative represented by general
formula [I]: 

wherein R1 is
(i) - -COOR2 (wherein R2 is (1) hydrogen, (2) a
pharmacologically acceptable cation or (3) an alkyl group
having 1 to 14 carbon atoms) or(ii) the group:

(wherein R3 is an alkyl group having 1 to 4 carbon atoms);
A is
(i) -(CH2)n- (wherein n represents is zero or an
integer of up to 3),(ii) -CH=CH- or(iii) the group:

(wherein each of R4 and R5, independently of one
