<ABSTRACT>
Expandable, modular decorative frame for the supports or bases of electrical units, consisting of a regular master module with symmetric corners or vertices, provided internally and diagonally with masked female anchor points, force-fitting on male means situated on the base housings of electrical units, which are made substantially vertical and in line with the bottom of the frame, including a radial segment for female anchoring and rigid assembly with the vertex and a free end for crimping in the manner of a clip, the frame possibly being produced in double, triple or more versions, by modular and successive sizing of two parallel (longitudinal) sides of the module, keeping the vertices of the latter unchanged and spacing the transverse separations equidistantly. This frame is recommended for single or combined electrical unit supports, with single or multiple components in horizontal and vertical projection, or in both directions.

Polydimensional modular decorative frame for supports or bases of 
electrical apparatus, which is constituted by a modular frame of standardized 

format (1), characterized in that it comprises a regular square moulding (1) 
with symmetrical corners (5) of convex semi-arch profile (2), bordered by a 

flat base (3) with female anchoring means (4) projecting axially along the 
bisectrix of the apices (5) of said corners, which are verticalized and in 

bundles or level with the base or lower face (15) of the frame (1). 
Polydimensional modular decorative frame for supports or bases of 
electrical apparatus which comprises a moulding (1) of standardized square 

format, according to Claim 1, characterized in that it is only necessary to 
dimension modularly, in repeated and successive manner, two longitudinal 

parallel sides of the frame (1) by maintaining invariably symmetrical the apices 
(5) and to space them at equidistance (20-20') (21-21'-21") to obtain double, 

triple, quadruple or successive versions of said frames (1). 
Polydimensional modular decorative frame for supports or bases of 
electrical apparatus according to Claim 1, characterized in that the female 

anchorings (4) comprise a radial ramification merging with the bisectrix of the 
angle (5) composed of two sections, one inside and free for female fitting and 

the other rigid for connection with said apex (5). 
Polydimensional modular decorative frame for supports or bases of 
electrical apparatus, according to Claim 3, characterized in that the means for 

fitting the anchoring ramification (4) is a tubular nozzle (6) provided with a 
radial opening (+/- 45Â°) (7) opposite the rigid section which comprises two 

vertical edges in re-entrant chamfer (8) and, as for the rest, it is divided into 
equal portions by means of thin vertical grooves (9).  

 
Polydimensional modular decorative frame for supports or bases of 
electrical apparatus, according to Claim 1, characterized in that said female 

fitting nozzle (6) comprises, inside and centred, a toric stria or rib (16). 
Polydimensional modular decorative frame for supports or bases of 
electrical apparatus, according to Claim 3, characterized in that the rigid inner 

section fitting with the apex (5) of the anchoring (4) comprises a partition or 
gusset (10) of edge tangential to the nozzle (6) located on the bisectrix at the 

apex (5), partially attached by a small lower portion (11) to said nozzle (6), the 
rest being provided with a thin vertical groove (12) for separation between the 

gusset (10) and the nozzle (6). 
Polydimensional modular decorative frame for supports or bases of 
electrical apparatus, according to any one of Claims 1 and 3 to 5, characterized 

in that the male anchoring means comprise a cylindrical stud with reversed 
cone-formed projection (13) with proportional diameter increasing towards the 

top or decreasing downwardly, in the direction of the inner diameter of the 
nozzle (6) of the female anchoring (4), abutting against and tangential to the 

edges (14) of the inner framework (17) of the base frames (14a) and comprising 
a very thin toric cut or notch (18) for the circumferential locking of the toric 

rib (16) of the tubular nozzle (6).
