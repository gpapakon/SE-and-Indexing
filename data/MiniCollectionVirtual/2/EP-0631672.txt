<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a ferro-electric liquid crystal device.EP-A-0032362 discloses a surface stabilised FLC device which possesses
bistability and fast switching. However, in most real devices as cooled from the
isotropic phase to the Sc* phase, instead of a structure consisting of smectic layers
normal to the substrate interface as disclosed in EP-A-0032362, a tilted layer structure
called a chevron is obtained. Consequently, this gives rise to a relatively small
effective bistable switching angle which tends to reduce the overall optical
performance of the device. The existence of two different forms of the chevron
structure also provides an alignment texture consisting of visible defects called
'zig-zags'. These defects usually degrade the appearance of the device.In order to overcome the above problems of zig-zag defects and a reduced
switching angle, a liquid crystal device has been proposed in GB2191870-B in which
the surface pre-tilt angle matches the half cone angle of the ferro-electric liquid crystal
material. However this technique presently requires the use of a vacuum deposited
surface alignment layer in order to generate the required pre-tilt angle of 22.5°, which
is costly for use in high volume production.GB2183054 B, discloses the application of a high voltage, low frequency
electrical signal to a ferro-electric liquid crystal device to irreversibly reduce the
chevron angle so that at the end of the electrical treatment, a layer structure known
as the Quasi Bookshelf Geometry (QBG), very similar to the idealised bookshelf, is
obtained. Such samples not only have large electrical threshold but also contain
defects which scatter light and reduce optical performance.Based on the relative orientation of the surface pre-tilt, β and the chevron 
inclination, two forms of tilted layer structure can be realised; Chevron 1 (C1) and
Chevron 2 (C2) as disclosed in an article by J. Kanbe et al. Ferro-electrics
14,(1991)P3. The geometrical conditions for these forms are given in Figure 1 where
δ and c are the chevron angle and half of the Sc* cone angle respectively. The value
of c is usually arranged to be ≈22.5° and from X-ray diffraction measurements, δ is
typically 90% of c i.e. ≈20°.In devices with low values of the surface pre-tilt angle (β), both C1 and C2
chevrons are stable i.e. both c+δ>β and c-δ>β can be satisfied respectively. Under
these conditions both chevrons are found; zig-zag defects occur at the boundary
between the two chevron states and there is very little twist of the
