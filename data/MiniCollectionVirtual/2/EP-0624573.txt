<ABSTRACT>
Biologically active 1α-hydroxy-22-iodinated vitamin D₃ 
compounds and a process for the preparation of 

1α-hydroxy-22-iodinated vitamin D₃ compounds are disclosed. The 
22-iodo-vitamin D₃ compounds show relatively high binding affinity 

for the vitamin D receptor demonstrating their potential for high in 
vivo biological activity. Further, these compounds induce relatively 

high differentiation of malignant cells. Also, these 22-iodo 
compounds show high in vivo calcium transport activity with little 

or no bone calcium mobilization activity. These compounds thus 
show promise in the treatment of osteoporosis.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to biologically active vitamin D3 
compounds. More specifically, the invention relates to1α-hydroxylated-22-iodinated 
vitamin D3 compounds and a process 
for the preparation thereof. The 1α-hydroxylated metabolites of vitamin D -- most 
importantly 1α,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 and 
1α,25-dihydroxyvitamin D2 -- are known as highly potent 
regulators of calcium homeostasis in animals and humans, and 
more recently their activity in cellular differentiation has also 
been established. V. Ostrem et al, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA, 
(1987), 84, 2610. As a consequence, many structural analogs of 
these metabolites, such as compounds with different side chain 
structures, different hydroxylation patterns, or different 
stereochemistry, have been prepared and tested. Important 
examples of such analogs are 1α-hydroxyvitamin D3, 
1α-hydroxyvitamin D2, various side chain fluorinated derivatives 
of 1α,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3, and side chain homologated 
analogs. Several of these known compounds exhibit highly 
potent activity invivo or invitro, and some of these have been 
found to exhibit an interesting separation of activities in cell 
differentiation and calcium regulation. This difference in activity 
provides these compounds with advantageous therapeutic 
activity profiles and thus numerous of these compounds are in 
use, or have been proposed for use, in the treatment of a variety 
of diseases such as renal osteodystrophy, vitamin D-resistant 
rickets, osteoporosis, psoriasis, and certain malignancies. In a continuing effort to explore pharmacologically 
important vitamin D analogs, several new 22-iodinated vitamin 
D3 compounds have now been synthesized. The 22-iodinated 
compounds show relatively high binding affinity for the vitamin 
D receptor thus demonstrating their potential for high invivo 
biological activity. Further, these compounds induced relatively 
high differentiation of malignant cells. Also, these 22-iodo  
 
compounds showed high invivo calcium transport activity with 
little or no bone calcium mobilization activity. Accordingly, the 
22-iodo compounds show promise in the treatment of 
osteoporosis, particularly senile osteoporosis and 
postmenopausal osteoporosis. The iodo compounds can also be 
labeled with radio iodine to be used for 1α,25-(OH)2-D3 assays. Fig. 1 is a graph of the percent differentiation of HL-60 
cells versus concentration for a prior art vitamin D3 compound 
and two of the new 22-iodo-vitamin D3 compounds; and Fig. 2 is a graph of the competitive
