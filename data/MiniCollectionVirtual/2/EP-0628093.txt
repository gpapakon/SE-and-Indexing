<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates generally to an 
emission control system for minimizing the atmospheric 
introduction of volatile constituents from fluid 
compositions used to treat articles as part of or 
incident to a manufacturing procedure. In EP-A-0498877 
a system for minimizing the escape of 
volatile compositions to the atmosphere is described 
wherein an article to be treated is placed in a chamber 
capable of maintaining both pressure and an effective 
vacuum, evacuating the chamber to remove virtually all 
gases, introducing into the chamber a fluid composition 
comprised of volatile constituents such as a solvent for  
 
treating the article, recovering the fluid and vapor 
components of the solvent composition following the 
treatment step and subsequently removing residual liquid 
by flushing the chamber with a drying fluid. The drying 
fluid is derived from the residual charge of 
noncondensable gas and solvent vapor within a closed loop 
system. The chamber is evacuated and the chamber then 
opened to the atmosphere for removal of the article. In a closed perimeter system of the type 
contemplated herein a vapor barrier or perimeter is used 
to form an enclosure around a solvent consuming process 
to thereby prevent solvent emission and air entry into 
the process. The closed perimeter system is applicable 
to cleaning/flushing, drying, coating, degreasing/ 
defluxing solvent cooled machining, etc. It was early 
recognized that the secret to avoiding solvent emission 
is to prevent the solvent from coming into contact with 
air. If allowed to mix with air inevitably some solvent 
will be lost to the atmosphere. Since pressure within the enclosure is 
maintained at essentially room pressure, the enclosure 
can be very lightweight and can be as simple as a frame 
covered with film or as complex as a sealed skin 
enclosure. There is flexibility as to where the 
enclosure is placed to make necessary operator or 
maintenance access easier. At startup the enclosure is filled with air, as 
solvent vapor is added due to loss from the process, gas 
volume increases. The solvent vapor is passed through a 
stripper and the gas is stored in a pressure controlling 
accumulator. When the volume limit of the accumulator is 
reached, venting from the system occurs. Gas from the 
exit of the stripper, having the lowest solvent vapor 
concentration in the system, is vented. Recovery of this 
small vapor loss by a carbon absorber may be used, or the  
 
solvent vapor may be destroyed to prevent its emission
