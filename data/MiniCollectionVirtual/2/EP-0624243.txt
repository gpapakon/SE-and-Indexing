<DESCRIPTION>
 DescriptionINSTRUMENT FOR MEASUREMENT OF VACUUM IN SEALED THIN WALL PACKETSThis invention was made with Government support under Contract No. DE-AC05-84OR21400 awarded by the U. S. Department of Energy. The research was funded through the Building Thermal Envelope Systems and Materials Program (BTESM) from the Office of Buildings Energy Research, Building Systems and Materials Division. The Government has certain rights in this invention.Technical FieldThis invention relates to the determination of vacuum in enclosed containers, and more particularly to an instrument for the measurement of vacuum in sealed, thin-walled packets such as plastic film packets.Background ArtThere are a large number of products in industry that are encased in plastic film packets. Many of these products require the presence of a vacuum within the packets, such as for the preservation of food and drug products. Another important sealed product is the super-insulator packets of precipitated silicon dioxide powder and similar powders having low thermal conductivity in vacuum. In these and other applications it is desirable to exclude air and other gases to prevent various types of reactions with the material that is enclosed and to prevent undesirable effects on the physical properties of the packets, e.g. thermal conductivity.There has been a need, therefore, to measure the value of the internal vacuum after the sealing operation, as well as after storage for any length of time. This measurement needs to be non-intrusive, i.e., there should be no potential intrusion into the packet.SHEET 

 One instrument that has been utilized in the prior art involves immersing the entire sealed packet into a vacuum system, and then "interrogating" the packet optically for movement of the film envelope when the chamber vacuum falls below the packet vacuum. This type of equipment is expensive and, more important, is time consuming when each packet must be individually tested in the vacuum chamber. In particular, this type of equipment is not readily amenable to inclusion in production line testing.References that may be pertinent to the evaluation of this invention are ϋ. S. Patent Numbers: 4,478,070 issued to E. . Clifford, et al, on October 23, 1984; 4,715,215 issued to J. M. Perhach, et al, on December 29, 1987; and 4,747,299 issued to J. M. Fox, et al, on May 31, 1988. All of these devices require extensive (and thus expensive) equipment, and since each packet must be evaluated, the testing is time consuming with these devices of the
