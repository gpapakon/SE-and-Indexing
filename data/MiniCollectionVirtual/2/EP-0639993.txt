<ABSTRACT>
An autocapture system within an implantable pulse generator automatically maintains the energy of a stimulation pulse at a level just above that which is needed to effectuate capture. The electrical post-stimulus signal of the heart following delivery of a stimulation pulse is compared to a polarization template (178) determined during a capture verification test. A prescribed difference between the polarization template and the post-stimulus signal (180) indicates capture has occured. Otherwise, a loss-of-capture routine is invoked (182) that increases the energy a prescribed amount to obtain capture. During a capture verification test, the pulse generator determines a polarization template for a particular stimulation energy and for each of a plurality of sensitivity or threshold settings. A determination is also made as to which sensitivity settings yield capture. An autocapture routine extends the capture verification test data to a wide range of stimulation energies.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to implantable
medical devices , and more particularly to
a system for use within an implantable
pacemaker to automatically determine if a given
stimulation pulse has effectuated capture. Further,
the invention relates to a system that
automatically adjusts the energy of the stimulation
pulse so that it will always efficiently effectuate
capture, i.e., so that it contains just enough energy
to effectuate capture without expending significant
energy over that needed for capture.A pacemaker is a medical device, typically
implanted within a patient, that provides electrical
stimulation pulses to selected chambers of the heart,
i.e., the atrium and/or the ventricle. Such
stimulation pulses cause the muscle tissue of the
heart (myocardial tissue) to depolarize and contract,
thereby causing the heart to beat at a controlled
rate.Most pacemakers can be programmed to operate
in a demand mode of operation, i.e., to generate and
deliver stimulation pulses to the heart only when the
heart fails to beat on its own. To this end, the
pacemaker senses cardiac activity, i.e., heart beats,
and if the heart beats do not occur at a prescribed
rate, then stimulation pulses are generated and
delivered to an appropriate heart chamber, either the
atrium or the ventricle, in order to force the heart
to beat.When operating in a demand mode of operation,
the pacemaker defines a period of time, referred to 
generally as the "escape interval" (which may further
be referred to as either an "atrial escape interval"
or a "ventricular escape interval," depending upon the
mode of operation of the pacemaker) that is slightly
longer than the period of time between normal heart
beats. Upon sensing such a "natural" (non-stimulated
or non-paced) heart beat within the allotted time
period, the escape interval is reset, and a new escape
interval is started. A stimulation (or pacing) pulse
will be generated at the conclusion of this new escape
interval unless a natural heart beat is again sensed
during the escape interval. In this way, stimulation
pulses are generated "on demand," i.e., only when
needed, in order to maintain the heart rate at a rate
that never drops below the rate set by the escape
interval.The heart rate is monitored by examining the
electrical signals that are manifest concurrent with
the depolarization or contraction of the myocardial
tissue. The contraction of atrial muscle tissue is
manifest by the generation of a P-wave. The
contraction of ventricular muscle tissue is manifest
by the
