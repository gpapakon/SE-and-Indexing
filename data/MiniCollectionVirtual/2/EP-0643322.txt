<ABSTRACT>
A camera locks out an attempted flash 
photograph when the voltage of the flash charger is 

below a minimum voltage necessary for the flash to 
fire. Flash lockout may also take place when: the 

flash charger voltage is equal to or greater than 
the minimum flash voltage but less than the lowest 

voltage in a voltage range providing optimum flash 
lighting; and the photographic subject distance is 

beyond the flash range at the present flash charger 
voltage. Lockout may also be determined based on 

current flash charger charging time compared to 
predetermined times for the flash charger to reach 

the minimum voltage and/or the lowest voltage in 
the optimum lighting range from a substantially 

discharged state.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention generally relates to cameras. More particularly, the
present invention relates to cameras that do not allow a flash photograph to be taken
until the flash charger reaches a predetermined voltage.Many cameras today have features which help prevent or lockout
underexposed photographs from being taken. One such feature, known as "flash
lockout", prevents the user from taking a photo where a flash is necessary, until the
flash charger has charged to an acceptable voltage. Reaching the acceptable
voltage has been termed "ready light", since many cameras have a light for
indicating when the acceptable voltage has been reached. In the past, ready light
has occurred between full charge and a charge corresponding to a half stop down
from full charge, even though the flash will generally fire at a voltage below traditional
ready light.Although traditional flash lockout helps reduce poor quality photos, it also
prevents photos from being taken at times when the flash would actually fire and
provide adequate or acceptable lighting.European Patent Application 0 326 815 A1 discloses a flash circuit in which
flash ready condition is indicated at a determined flash time which is a predetermined
time less than that necessary for full flash charge condition. U.S. Patent 4,908,642
discloses an automatic focus control camera in which, when a flash picture is
required, a focusing limiting function is applied to limit the lens driving system to a 
focusing range which is within the range and distance to which the strobe flash can
go.Thus, a need exists for a camera with a flash lockout feature that takes
advantage of the fact that a flash may fire at a significantly lower voltage than
traditional ready light.Briefly, the present invention satisfies the need for a camera with a flash lockout
feature that does not unnecessarily lock out photos by providing for flash lockout if
either the flash charger is charged below a minimum voltage necessary for the flash
to fire, or the flash charger voltage is at or above the minimum voltage but below
ready light and the photo subject is beyond the flash range at the present voltage.In a first aspect of the present invention, a camera is provided as defined in
Claim 1. Essentially, a camera is provided with a flash, a flash charger, a means for
measuring a charge characteristic of the flash charger said means constituting either
means for measuring the voltage of the flash charger or timing means for measuring
the charging time, a shutter, a means for initiating

<CLAIMS>
A camera, comprising:

a flash (36);
a flash charger (40,38);
means for measuring a charge characteristic representative of a present
charge of said flash charger, said means constituting either means (30) for

measuring the voltage of the flash charger or timing means (62) for measuring
the charging time;
a shutter (58);
means (46) for measuring a distance of a photographic subject from said
camera;
means (30,60) for initiating synchronized release of said shutter and
attempted firing of said flash;
means (30,60) for locking out said release of said shutter and said attempted
firing of said flash in response to activation of said initiating means if:


said charge characteristic indicates a present degree of charge that is
equal to or greater than a minimum charge (16) required by said flash for

firing but less than a predetermined charge (20) between said minimum
charge (16) and a maximum flash-charge (22), wherein said flash

produces optimum lighting at charges in a range between and including
said predetermined charge and said maximum flash-charge, and
said distance is greater than a maximum flash distance at said present
charge.
A camera according to claim 1, wherein said charge characteristic is charge

said means for measuring a charge characteristic constitutes timing means
for measuring a current charging time of said flash charger, wherein a first time

corresponds to a predetermined time for said flash charger to charge from a
substantially discharged state to a minimum flash-charger voltage required by said flash for

firing, and wherein a second time corresponds to a predetermined time for said
flash charger to charge from said substantially discharged state to a predetermined

flash-charger voltage between said minimum flash-charger voltage and a maximum flash-charger
