 HAND-HELD. PORTABLE STEAM RAZORFIELD OF THE INVENTION This invention relates to a new shaving apparatus for using the physical and therapeutic properties of steam and vapor.BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION Steam has long been used for treating the body owing to the therapeutic effects of moisture-laden vapor for treating skin and hair.The use of steam in shaving allows the hair fibers to be moistened and facilitates removal of the hair.The use of steam in skin treatment is generally known, such as applied at steam baths for causing perspiration and opening of the pores. The use of steam as a body treatment aids in relaxing muscles, and helps to cleanse the skin through heating of the natural body oils to a more liquified state in which removal of the oils is facilitated as by wiping or washing away the oils.It is also known that many people find it easier to shave after having showered or bathed, as the hair to be removed has swelled and softened owing to the absorption or adsorption of water by the hair.U.S. Patent No. 4,399,349 to Deming et al. discloses an electrically heated facial sauna appliance having a heater such as a ceramic resistance or positive 

temperature coefficient (PTC) heater enclosed in an aluminum case. A thermostat calibrated to about 100° - 110°C is attached to the Deming heater. A fan is used to propel the steam toward the face. No shavers or razors are disclosed, although Deming et al. generally describe putting water or aqueous solutions or emulsions containing medicaments, colognes or perfumes, moisturizers, and the like, into a water tank steam generating chamber. U.S. Patent No. 3,800,810 to Mercer discloses an appliance construction for use as a hair dressing tool and a steam iron that schematically shows a tool or implement which may be a brush, comb, or the like, advantageously formed with passageways (not shown) through the comb back or brush back for passing fluid from the interior of a work head exteriorly thereof. Mercer describes the application of steam to hair for shaping hair in hair-dressing and hair-styling operations; however, no disclosure is made of applying steam to treat facial hair or other unwanted hair to be removed by shaving.U.S. Patent No. 4,596,565 to Ruderian discloses a salve applicator having a vibrating element independently operable for being operated independently of a blower motor. The vibrating element essentially vibrates the casing and thereby facilitates the absorption of a medicant into the pores of a body portion when the salve applicator

<CLAIMS>
WHAT IS CLAIMED IS:
1. A steam shaver comprising: a) a housing; b) a blade disposed on said housing; c) a steam source provided in said housing; and d) said steam source being associated with said blade for providing steam adjacent to said blade.
2. A steam shaver as defined in claim 1, wherein: a) said steam source includes: i) a heating element; ii) a liquid reservoir configured for holding a quantity of liquid; and iii) an outlet provided in said reservoir for causing a liquid to exit said reservoir and come sufficiently close to said heating element for causing said heating element to convert the liquid into a vapor.
3. A steam shaver as defined in claim 1, wherein: a) said steam source includes: i) a heater; ii) a water source; iii) a valve disposed between said water source and said heater; and iv) said valve being configured for dripping water onto said heater when said valve is actuated.
4. A steam shaver as defined in claim 1, wherein: a) a motor is provided in said housing; b) an eccentric weight is operatively associated with said motor; and c) said eccentric weight is configured for vibrating said housing when said motor is operated.
5. A steam shaver as defined in claim 1, wherein: 


 a) a detent is provided between said housing and said blade for detachably attaching said blade to said housing.
6. A device, comprising: a) a housing; b) means disposed on said housing for cutting off human hair; and c) means provided in said housing for generating steam.
7. A device as defined in claim 6, wherein: a) means is provided in said housing for directing steam supplied by said steam generating means substantially adjacent to said human hair cutting means.
8. A device as defined in claim 6, wherein: a) means is provided in said housing for vibrating said housing and said human hair cutting means.
9. A device as defined in claim 6, wherein: a) said human hair cutting means includes a stationary razor blade.
10. A device as defined in claim 6, wherein: a) said human hair cutting means includes a powered shaver for shaving hair off of human skin.
11. A device as defined in claim 10, wherein: a) said powered shaver includes a plurality of reciprocating blades.
12. A hand-held, portable razor, comprising: a) a housing; b) a liquid reservoir provided in said housing; c) a vapor generator disposed in said housing 


for converting a liquid from said liquid reservoir into a vapor and for causing the vapor to exit said housing at a predetermined location; and d) a razor provided on said housing.
13. A hand-held, portable razor as defined in claim 12, wherein: a) said razor is located adjacent to said predetermined location.
14. A hand-held, portable razor as defined in claim 12, wherein: a) a fan is provided in said housing for propelling vapor from said vapor generator to said predetermined location.
15. A hand-held, portable razor as defined in claim 12, wherein: a) said razor is a powered razor having a plurality of spaced apart blades.
16. A hand-held, portable razor as defined in claim 15, wherein: a) a vapor passage is defined between at least two of said plurality of blades.
