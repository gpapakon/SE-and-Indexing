<ABSTRACT>
A process is provided for preparing 1,1,1,2-tetrafluoroethane. 
The process comprises fluorinating as 

a first step trichloroethylene in the gas phase with 
hydrogen fluoride in a first reaction to form 

1,1,1-trifluoro-2-chloroethane, and then fluorinating 
as a second step the 1,1,1-trifluoro-2-chloroethane 

in the gas phase with hydrogen fluoride in a second 
reaction to generate a first gaseous mixture 

comprising 1,1,1,2-tetrafluoroethane. At least a 
part of the first gaseous mixture is fed to the first 

reaction where it acts as diluent. In addition, 
hydrogen 
chloride is recovered between the first and 
second fluorination steps.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates 
to a process for preparing 1,1,1,2-tetrafluoroethane. 
More particularly, the present invention 
relates to a process for preparing 1,1,1-trifluorochloroethane 
by reacting trichloroethylene and hydrogen fluoride 
and preparing 1,1,1,2-tetrafluoroethane by further fluorinating 
1,1,1-trifluorochloroethane. 1,1,1,2-Tetrafluoroethane (hereinafter referred to 
as "R-134a") is a promising substitute for dichlorodifluoromethane 
(R-12) which is widely used as a refrigerant, and it 
is highly desired to establish a process for producing R-134a. 
1,1,1-Trifluorochloroethane (hereinafter referred to 
as "R-133a") is useful as an intermediate in the preparation 
of R-134a or a raw material for the preparation of trifluoroethanol. Various processes are known for the preparation of 
R-134a but each process has its own advantages and disadvantages. For example, in a process comprising reducing 
CF₃CCl₂F (R-114a) with hydrogen, a conversion is high but a 
life of a catalyst is very short.  In a process comprising reacting trichloroethylene 
and hydrogen fluoride to obtain R-133a and then fluorinating 
R-133a with hydrogen fluoride in a gas phase (cf. Japanese 
Patent Kokai Publication No. 72105/1973), a selectivity is 
high and a life of a catalyst is long, but the process has 
the following drawbacks: 
1. Since the reaction for fluorinating trichloroethylene 
is an exothermic reaction which generates a large 
amount of heat (about 30 Kcal./mole), control of the reaction 
is difficult. 2. Since, in the fluorination step of R-133a, 
1,1-difluorochloroethylene (hereinafter referred to as "R-1122) 
which forms an azeotropic mixture with R-134a is contained 
in the reaction mixture, it is difficult to separate 
R-134a from the reaction mixture. When R-134a is prepared by the above conventional 
process, the steps shown in Fig. 1 are employed. In this process, trichloroethylene and hydrogen 
fluoride are supplied to a first reactor. A generated gas 
contains R-133a, unreacted hydrogen fluoride and hydrogen 
chloride. If the generated gas is introduced directly to a 
second reactor, R-134a is not produced due to unfavorable 
equilibrium. Therefore, the gas is introduced in a hydrogen 
chloride separator to remove hydrogen chloride from the 
gas. The remaining gas is then supplied to the second reactor 
and simultaneously a supplement amount of hydrogen fluoride  
 
is added. A reaction mixture from the second reactor 
comprises desired R-134a, unreacted R-133a and hydrogen 
fluoride, and a
