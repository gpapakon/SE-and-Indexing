<ABSTRACT>
An ankle brace having 
a rigidifying and unitizing external 

shell (12) comprising a unitary member made of a rigid material and 
including a 

leg encircling portion at least substantially encircling the lower leg 
of the 

wearer and ankle stays (34,36) extending downwardly from the leg 
encircling portion 

over the ankle and down to the heel on both the medial and lateral 
sides of the 

leg, the leg encircling portion accommodating flexing of the sides of 
the shell 

about a vertical axis intermediate the ankle stays for movement of the 
sides 

and the stays horizontally into supporting engagement with the medial 
and 

lateral sides of the leg and ankle, the shell preventing undesired 
movement of 

the ankle stays relative to one another. The ankle brace also features a 
metatarsal support (20) extending from the region of the metatarsals over 

the lateral 
side and instep of the wearer's foot to the medial side of the shell, 

where the 
shell provides a rigid post for anchoring the metatarsal support.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to ankle braces for inhibiting inversion
and eversion of the ankle while permitting freedom of movement for plantar
flexion and dorsiflexion.Ankle braces for inhibiting inversion and eversion of the ankle while
permitting relatively uninhibited plantar flexion and dorsiflexion of the foot, or
for controlling plantar flexion and/or dorsiflexion, have been available for
many years, indeed since at least the turn of the century.With the advent of modern materials of construction, especially
plastics, the braces have become lighter, less cumbersome, more easily fitted
to and removed from the leg and ankle, and better adapted to the performance
of their intended functions.Of late, one ankle brace that has acquired particular acceptance is the
so-called stirrup ankle brace, representative examples of which are illustrated
in the patent to Glenn W. Johnson, Jr. No. 4,280,489 and the patent to Tracy
Grim No. 4,844,094. As shown by these patents, the brace comprises a base
member on which the heel of the wearer rests, a pair of rigid side members
hingedly connected to opposite sides of the base member and extending
upwardly on opposite sides of the ankle and along the lower leg, a pair of 
cushioning pads respectively coextensive with and secured to the inner surfaces
of the side members for cushioning the leg and ankle, and a pair of leg
encircling straps adapted to be wrapped about the lower leg and the two side
members to hold the side members in place with the pads firmly and snugly
engaging the opposite sides of the leg and ankle.When applied to the leg and ankle, the side members inhibit inversion
and eversion, i.e., twisting, of the ankle, but the brace is open to the front and
rear and thereby permits normal plantar flexion and dorsiflexion. The brace is
designed to be received in a conventional shoe, whereby the wearer may
engage in normal activities, such as walking, running and sports activities,
while the ankle is protected against inversion and eversion. The Grim patent
also provides a counter strap at the achilles tendon and eyelets on the front
edges of the side members so that the brace can be tied to the wearer's shoe
by the lace of the shoe, thereby to gain further support.While the stirrup ankle brace is an effective product which has gained
wide acceptance, it does suffer a problem referred to as "pistoning".
Specifically, because the side members are of necessity hingedly connected to
the base member (so that the side members can be swung into engagement

<CLAIMS>
An ankle brace adapted to be fitted about the lower leg and
ankle of a wearer for inhibiting inversion and eversion of the

ankle while accommodating plantar flexion and dorsiflexion of
the wearer's foot, comprising:


a unitary boot (10) made of a flexible, conformable, cushioning
material and including a leg encircling portion (24) for encircling

the lower leg of the wearer, ankle portions extending
downwardly over the ankle on both the medial and lateral sides

of the leg, and a foot portion (26) extending under the heel of
the wearer and secured to and interconnecting the lower ends of

said ankle portions;
a rigidifying shell overlying said boot, said shell having upper
and lower ends and comprising an integral member (12) of a substantially

rigid material, said member including a leg encircling
portion (32) at its upper end adapted to at least substantially

encircle the lower leg of the wearer above the ankle
and achilles tendon and a pair of spaced apart ankle stays (34,

36) extending substantially vertically downward from opposite
sides of said leg encircling portion over the ankle and down to

the heel of the wearer on both the medial and laterial sides of
the leg,
the sides of said leg encircling portion (32) of said shell (12)
being sufficiently flexible about a vertical axis intermediate

said ankle stays to encircle and thereby accomodate the wearer's
leg and ankle; and
fastening means (16, 18) encircling said shell for holding said
shell in firm supporting engagement with the leg and ankle of

the wearer,

characterized in that the leg encircling portion (24) of the
boot (10) underlies and is held in supporting engagement with

said leg encircling portion (32) of the shell member (12) and
that a metatarsal support (20) extends from the region of the

fifth metatarsal of the wearer's foot over the lateral side and
instep of the foot to the medial side of said shell (12), said 

shell (12) comprising a rigid post for anchoring said metatarsal
support (20) to said shell (12).
An ankle brace as set forth in claim 1, wherein said leg
encircling portion (32) of said shell (12) extends around the

back and at least both sides of the wearer's leg.
An ankle brace as set forth in claim 1 or claim 2, wherein
said leg encircling portion (32) of said shell (12) extends

around the front and at least both sides of wearer's leg.
An ankle brace as set forth in any of the preceding claims
including fastening means (16, 18) having means of attachement

to a single location on said shell and encircling said shell
without further attachment to said shell whereby said fastening

means exerts a uniform pressure around the circumference of the
wearer's leg.
An ankle brace as set forth in any of the preceding claims
for insertion of the lower ends of said ankle stays into a shoe

with laces, said shell including fastening means (22) on one of
said stays to receive a lace of the shoe.
An ankle brace as set forth in any one of the preceding
claims, including a heel strap (14) extending between the lower

ends of said ankle stays and adapted to extend under the wearer's
heel, said heel strap having an adjustable connection with

at least one of said ankle stays for fitting said stays to the
heel of the wearer. 
An ankle brace as set forth in any one of the preceding
claims, wherein said foot portion of said unitary boot extends

forwardly toward the region of the metatarsals of the wearer's
foot, and said metatarsal support is attached to said foot

portion of said boot in the region of the metatarsals of the
wearer's foot.
An ankle brace as set forth in any one of the preceding
claims for insertion of the foot portion of said boot and the

lower ends of said ankle stays into a shoe, said shell having no
contact with the posterior surface of the heel of the wearer and

accomodating insertion of the boot and the lower ends of said
ankle stays into the wearer's shoe.
