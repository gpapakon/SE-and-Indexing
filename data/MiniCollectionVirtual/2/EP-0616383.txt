<ABSTRACT>
A half-wave dipole antenna (10) is arranged on one side (19) of a single printed circuit board (20) of the radio set, in addition to the electronic circuits. This antenna (10) has two arms (11, 12) which are of equal length and are arranged on the edge (25) of the board. One arm (11) is connected to a matching line (15) which is composed of printed, high-impedance microstrip lines (17.1, 17,2) and discrete capacitors (18.1, 18.2) and its impedance is matched to the input impedance of the antenna (10). Arranged on the other side (21) of the board (20) is a large-area earth surface (22) which, in an assigned manner, covers the region of the matching line (15) and leaves the region of the antenna arms (11, 12) uncovered. To this end, the surface (22) terminates with a relatively sharp end (23). The second arm (12) is connected to this end (23) through the board (20), and is thus earthed.
