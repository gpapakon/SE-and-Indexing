<ABSTRACT>
An electric vehicle control device for a plurality of 
vehicles connected in series to form a formation including a 

plurality of control devices, each being provided for one of 
the vehicles, respectively. Each of the control devices 

includes a PWM converter device (COV) for receiving a first A.C. 
power through a current collector (PAN) and a transformer (MT) from an 

A.C. overhead line and for converting the first A.C. power 
into a D.C. power using a PWM carrier wave, an inverter (INV) 

connected to D.C. output terminals of the PWM converter 
device for converting the D.C. power into a second A.C. 

power, and an electric motor (MM) connected to A.C. output 
terminals of the inverter for being driven by the second 

A.C. power. Phase angles of the PWM carrier waves in the 
PWM converter devices are determined to be mutually shifted 

by a predetermined angle, thereby higher harmonics of the 
PWM carrier waves leaking into the A.C. overhead line are 

reduced.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to an electric vehicle control device, and more particularly to an electric vehicle control device wherein electric motors are driven by PWM converters and inverters.Figure 5 of the accompanying drawings shows one example of a layout of a conventional electric vehicle control device. A.C. power is obtained from an overhead line and is converted by a converter device into D.C. power, which is supplied as drive power to the motor of the electric vehicle, and is also supplied to an auxiliary power source device.This conventional electric vehicle control device consists of:
a transformer MT that accepts on its primary side A. C. electric power obtained through a current collector PAN from an.A.C. overhead line (not shown), and steps down the voltage of this A.C. power:a rectifier RF which rectifies the secondary output of transformer MT; anda motor control device MCTR and an auxiliary power source device APS connected in parallel with the output side of rectifier RF. Motor control device MCTR controls a motor MM in accordance with either a motoring operation command signal p from a motoring operation command circuit MC or in accordance with a brake command signal b from a brake command circuit BS. Auxiliary power source device APS generates device power for a load LD such as in-carriage air conditioners; illumination devices, and equipment cooling fans, etc.In recent years, electric vehicle control devices have come to be used in which a voltage source pulse width modulation converter (hereinbelow called a PWM converter device) is employed instead of the rectifier RF, and a VVVF (variable voltage variable frequency) inverter is employed instead of the motor control device MCTR. One example of such electric vehicle control device has been described in JP-A-4-340302.However, conventional electric vehicle control devices were subject to the problem that the higher harmonics produced by the switching in the voltage source PWM converter device leaked out into the current in the A.C. overhead line, with considerable adverse effects on the signalling equipments and communications system.The effects of such higher harmonics are further to be considered when power is fed from the voltage source PWM converter device to the auxiliary power source device. It suffices to feed power to the vehicle drive motor through the VVVF inverter only during motoring operation or braking operation but, the auxiliary power source device needs to be fed power uninterruptedly, including during periods of coasting
