<ABSTRACT>
The invention discloses a system for fixing slats (20), made of wood or similar material, and forming particularly a floor. The system allows to fix the slats (20) in a juxtaposed arrangement without damaging the slats owing to the use of tongues (10) wherein bearing elements (12) provided with teeths have been swaged. Said tongues (10) are placed on the subfloor (11) and are either fixed directly or held in place by gravity by means of flexible rubber supports (8) and of alignment slats (70) which maintain them at equal distance with respect to each other, thus without causing any damage to the subfloor (11). This fixing system provides for an easy installation and dismounting of slats (20) and is particularly appropriate for prevarnished wooden slats (20).

Fixing system for assembling wooden boards (20) juxtaposed,
parallel and of identical width, so as to cover a surface

(11), each of which boards (20) has a pre-varnished upper
surface (22), a lower surface (24) and two lateral sides

(26, 28), one of which carries a tenon (36) and the other a
mortise (38), which tenon (36) may be inserted into the mortise

(38) of an adjacent board (20), the fixing system comprising:

a set of thin, rigid tongues (10) which are intended to
be arranged parallel to each other on the surface (11) to be

covered so as to receive the lower surfaces (24) of the
boards (20), the tongues (10) extending in a direction transverse

to the boards (20),
means for keeping the tongues (10) in place relative to
each other,
a set of supports (12) projecting upwards, arranged on
the tongues (10) and having a distance between them that is

equal to the width of the boards (20) to be fixed,
the supports (12) being provided at the end of their upper
extremity with a pointed tooth (14), the supports (12)

and the tooth (14) being obtained through stamping of the
tongues (10),
the tooth (14) of each support (12) projecting in the
same longitudinal direction as the tongues (10), and the supports

(12) and teeth (14) being dimensioned so that the tooth
(14) can engage into a mortise (38) and a tenon (36) can on

its part be inserted therein so as to prevent the boards (20)
from rising and to allow them to be placed relative to each

other at a predetermined distance,
characterised
 in that
the means for keeping the tongues (10) in place relative
to each other consists of holes (42) made through the tongues

(10), with screws (44) having a head (45) placed therein and 
penetrating the surface (11) to be covered so that the

tongues (10) are rigidly attached to it,
the supports (12) of each tongue (10) are aligned with
the supports (12) of the adjacent tongues 810), and
the tongues (10) have cut marks (48) that serve as references
and allow the tongues (10) to be kept synchronised.
Fixing system for assembling wooden boards (20) juxtaposed,
parallel and of identical width, so as to cover a surface

(11), each of which boards (20) having a pre-varnished
upper surface (22), a lower surface (24) and two lateral

sides (26, 28), one of which carries a tenon (36) and the
other a mortise (38), which tenon (36) may be inserted into

the mortise (38) of an adjacent board (20), wherein the fixing
system comprises:


a set of thin, rigid tongues (10) which are intended to
be arranged parallel to each other on the surface (11) to be

covered so as to receive the lower surfaces (24) of the
boards, the tongues (10) extending in a direction transverse

the supports (12) being provided at the end of their upper
extremity with a pointed tooth (14), the supports (12)

and teeth (14) being obtained through stamping of the tongues
(10),
the teeth (14) projecting in the same longitudinal direction
as the tongues (10), the supports (12) and teeth (14)

being dimensioned so that the tooth 14 can engage in the mortise
(38) and a tenon (36) can on its part be inserted

therein so as to prevent the boards (20) from rising and to
allow them to be placed relative to each other at a predetermined

distance,
characterised
 in that
the tongues (10) rest on flexible rubber supports (80)
placed between the surface (11) to be covered and the tongues

(10) and extending in longitudinal direction of the tongues
(10),
the tongues (10) have side walls (90) projecting downwardly
and extending in the longitudinal direction of the

tongues (10) so that each tongue (10) grips its corresponding
flexible support (80),
the means for keeping the tongues (10) in place relative
to each other comprises a set of alignment strips (70) placed

perpendicularly to the tongues (10) across lateral openings
(94) in the side walls (90) of the tongues (10),
the alignment strips (70) have in their lateral edges
pairs of symmetrical notches (72) that fit with the side

walls (90) around the openings (94), and cross the tongues
(10) passing between them and their flexible supports (80),

the tongues (10) and the alignment strips (70) being arranged
so that each tongue fits with the notches (72) when the

alignment strips (70) cross it,
the side walls (90) of the tongues (10) exhibit pairs of
bulges (92) allowing the tongues (10) to grip the flexible

supports (80) more effectively,
the tongues (10) are disposed with regular intervals between
them and the notches (72) of the alignment strips (70)

are regularly spaced, and
the fixing system is held in place on the surface (11)
to be covered by gravity alone, the system allowing to place

and remove the wood without lifting the fixing system and
without disrupting the pre-synchronisation.
