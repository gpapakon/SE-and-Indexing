<ABSTRACT>
An arrangement for connecting a flange to a mating element, for example an engine block, proposes to arrange, both on the flange and on the engine block, at least one oblique surface extending at an acute angle to the sealing surface. The flange is then fixed on the mating element by being pushed in a direction parallel to the sealing surface, the two parts thus being fixed on one another by a wedging action.

<CLAIMS>
A connection for a flange (10,41,65), which has

1.1 at least one pipe (12),
1.2 an abutment surface surrounding the mouth of the pipe
(12), and also
1.3 at least one inclined surface associated therewith,
which


1.3.1 extends at an acute angle to the abutment surface,
with a counter member (1) which
1.4 has at least one opening (3),
1.5 a bearing surface (2) surrounding the opening (3),
which


1.5.1 is designed for mutual abutment against the abutment
surface of the flange (10,41,65), optionally with the

interposition of a seal (9), and also
1.6 at least one inclined surface associated therewith,
which


1.6.1 extends at an acute angle to the bearing surface (2)
and
1.6.2 is designed to abut against the inclined surface (13,
66) of the flange (10,41,65), wherein the counter

member (1) is an engine block (1).
A connection according to Claim 1, in which the
inclined surface associated with the counter member (1) is

formed on an auxiliary member (8) which can be connected to
the counter member (1).
A connection according to Claim 1 or 2 with a clamping
means to effect jamming or wedging between the flange and

the counter member. 
A connection according to any one of Claims 1 to 3,
with at least one clamping member which acts on the flange

(10,41,65) and/or on the counter member (1) with a force
component at least parallel to the bearing surface.
A connection according to Claim 3 or 4, in which
the clamping means has a clamping screw (14).
A connection according to Claim 3 or 4, in which the
clamping means has an eccentric member.
A connection according to Claim 3 or 4, the clamping
means has a toggle lever.
A connection according to any one of the preceding
Claims, in which the inclined surface (13,66) associated

with the flange (10,41,65) is formed on the flange
(10,41,65) itself.
A connection according to any one of the preceding
Claims, in which the flange (10,41,65) has inclined surfaces

(13,66) on two opposite sides.
A connection according to any one of the preceding
Claims, in which the inclined surfaces (13,66) of the flange

(10,41,65) are formed downwardly sloping towards the
outside.
A connection according to any one of the preceding
Claims, in which the inclined surfaces (43) of the flange

(41) are formed downwardly sloping in its longitudinal
direction.
A connection according to any one of the preceding
Claims, in which the inclined surfaces (43,66) of the 

flange (41,65) and/or of the counter member (1) are formed
on individual projections (42,44).
A connection according to any one of the preceding
Claims, in which one inclined surface associated with the

counter member (1) is formed by a wall of a groove.
A connection according to any one of Claims 3 to 14, in
which an inclined surface associated with the counter member

(1) is formed on a part acted upon by the clamping means, in
particular a clamping bar.
A connection according to any one of the preceding
Claims, in which an inclined surface associated with the

counter member (1) is formed on a clamping screw (14).
A connection according to any one of Claims 2 to 15, to
which the auxiliary member, preferably in the form of a bar

(8) which is continuous for all openings, can be screwed,
wherein said bar is screwed in particular by means of the

stay bolts (4) provided and/or the threaded bores provided.
A connection according to Claim 16, in which the flange
(10) is braced between two bars (5,8), both of which are

fastened with the stay bolts (4).
A connection according to Claim 16 or 17, in which on
one longitudinal side the flange (65) has tongues (70,72)

which can be inserted into recesses of the bar.
A connection according to any one of the preceding
Claims, in which the flange (10,41,65) is designed for the

connection of inlet pipes or outlet pipes.
