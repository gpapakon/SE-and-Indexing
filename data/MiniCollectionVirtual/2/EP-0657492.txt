<ABSTRACT>
The present invention relating to prepregs has the following 
constitution to achieve the above object. That is, a prepreg, 

comprising long reinforcing fibers [A], matrix resin [B]
 and a 
knitted fabric made from thermoplastic resin fibers [C]
, with the 
component [C]
 distributed near either or both of the surface 
layers.

 
Moreover, the present invention relating to processes for 

production of prepregs has either of the following constitution to 

achieve the above object. That is, a process for preparing a 
prepreg, comprising the steps of impregnating long reinforcing 

fibers [A] with matrix resin [B]
, and bonding a knitted fabric made 
from thermoplastic resin fibers [C]
 onto one side or both sides of 
the intermediate product, or a process for preparing a prepreg, 

comprising the step of bonding matrix resin [B] formed as a film, a 

knitted fabric made from thermoplastic resin fibers [C] and long 

reinforcing fibers [A].

 
The prepregs of the present invention contain, therefore, are tacky 

and drapable, and the composite materials obtained by heating and 
forming the prepregs are high in heat resistance, and very high in 

impact resistance and inter-layer toughness. Furthermore, the 
prepregs are easy to produce and high in their latitude in 

availability of materials, this being industrially significant.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to prepregs used for preparing fiber
reinforced plastics high in strength, elastic modulus, impact
resistance and inter-layer toughness,and processes for their
production.Fiber reinforced plastics as a kind of composite material are
anisotropic materials with reinforcing fibers and a matrix resin as
the essential components and their physical properties in the fiber
direction are greatly different from those in the other directions.In general, the strength and elastic modulus in the fiber
direction are very high but those in the other directions are low.
As a widely adopted method for producing a fiber reinforced plastic
material, layers of a filmy precursor called a prepreg formed by
impregnating reinforcing fibers with an uncured thermosetting resin
are laminated, formed and cured to obtain the intended product.
Hereinafter unless otherwise stated, the term "composite material"
means a fiber reinforced plastic material obtained by laminating
layers of a prepreg, and forming and hardening the laminate.When a composite material is obtained from a prepreg, a fabric
obtained by weaving reinforcing fibers is used in the prepreg, or
layers of a prepreg made of reinforcing fibers arranged
unidirectionally are laminated with the reinforcing fiber
directions crossed, for rendering the physical properties almost
isotropic in the obtained product.However, it is known that even if these techniques are adopted, the
impact resistance and other properties of the composite material 
are not fundamentally improved by enhancement of the strength of
the reinforcing fibers, since they are affected by inter-layer
fracture. The inter-layer region of the composite material is that
region in the vicinity of the interface between laminated layers of
prepregs. This region has a low content of reinforcing fibers, and
since the reinforcing fibers are differently oriented on both sides
of the interface, fracture is liable to occur in the region.
Especially a composite material with a thermosetting resin as the
matrix resin is insufficient in impact resistance since the matrix
resin is low in toughness. Furthermore, if a tensile load is
applied onto a crossed laminate, inter-layer peeling often occurs
at an end of the laminate, so the latitude in laminate composition
is often limited. Various methods are proposed for the purpose of
improving the physical properties in the directions other than the
fiber direction, especially impact resistance and inter-layer
toughness, and many techniques are proposed
