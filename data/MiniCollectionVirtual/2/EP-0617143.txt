<ABSTRACT>
Process for continuous coating with a deposit of polymer of a metallic material travelling inside a vessel under reduced pressure, according to which, inside the said vessel, the monomer of the said polymer is injected in the gaseous state and conditions are created for forming a cold plasma so as to produce a coating of the said material with the said polymer deposit, characterised in that, in at least one region of the said vessel the said material is passed through a magnetic field so as to produce a variation in the composition of the said polymer deposit in the said region. The invention also relates to a device for making use of this process and to the product thus obtained.

Process for continuously coating a running
metallic material with a polymer coating inside a vacuum

chamber, in which process the monomer of the said polymer
is injected in the gaseous state into the said chamber

and the conditions for generating a cold plasma so as to
coat the said material with the said polymer coating are

created, characterised in that, in one or more regions of
the said chamber where the said material is coated, but

not throughout them, the said material is made to pass
through a magnetic field so as to cause a variation in

the composition of the said polymer coating in the said
region or regions.
Process according to Claim 1, characterised in
that the said magnetic field has an intensity which

varies along the said region.
Device for continuously coating a running
metallic material (1) with a polymer coating, of the type

comprising a sealed chamber (2) provided with means (5,
6) for both obtaining and maintaining a reduced pressure

therein, means for making the said material (1) run
inside the said chamber (2), means (7, 8, 9) for

introducing into the chamber (2), in the gaseous state,
the monomer of the said polymer and means (11, 13, 24,

26, 27) for creating, inside the said chamber (2), the
conditions for generating a cold plasma in the path of

the said running material (1), characterised in that it
also comprises means (17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23) for 

superposing a magnetic field on the said cold plasma, the
said means being arranged over one or more portions of

the said path of the said running material (1) in which
the cold plasma is generated, but not throughout the said

path.
Device according to Claim 3, characterised in
that the said means (17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23) for

superposing a magnetic field on the said cold plasma over
a fraction of the said path of the said running material

(1) are included in a non-magnetic roll (14) comprising a
fixed core (15), in which the said means (17, 18, 19, 20,

21, 22, 23) are placed, and a shell (16) which can rotate
on the surface of the said fixed core, the external

surface of the said shell (16) being designed to support
the said running material (1).
Device according to Claim 3 or 4, characterised
in that the said means (17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23) for

superposing a magnetic field on the said cold plasma
consists of at least one permanent magnet.
Metal product which has been continuously coated
with a polymer coating by means of a process using a cold

plasma, the said coating being formed from several layers
of different compositions, characterised in that the said

layers have been obtained from the same monomer, at least
one of the layers having been formed in the presence of a

magnetic field superposed on the said cold plasma and
exhibiting a gradual variation in its organic/inorganic

character.
Metal product according to Claim 6,
characterised in that the monomer for the said polymer is

a silane or a siloxane.
