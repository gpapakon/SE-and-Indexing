<ABSTRACT>
A motorised drive device for a door leaf which has a door leaf shaft (6) coupled thereto, to which the drive shaft (26) of a drive motor unit (5) contained in a drive housing (25) is connected via a torque transmission device contained in a gear casing (2, 3), which has an input shaft (7) connected to the drive shaft (26) of the drive motor unit (5) and an output shaft (8) connected to the door leaf shaft (6) which, looking perpendicularly to the longitudinal axis of these shafts (7, 8), is at a distance from the input shaft amounting to a multiple of the sum of the half-diameters of the intercoupled gear wheels arranged on these shafts. To reduce the torque-determined holding load for the drive unit (5), the drive casing (25) of the drive motor unit (5) is maintained fixed and secured (29, 30) to the transmission casing (2, 3) of the torque transmission device so as not to rotate in such a way that torques between the door leaf shaft (6) and the drive shaft (26) are exerted in the manner of a rigid lever.

A motor drive mechanism for a door leaf, especially
a door leaf which is moveable into an overhead

position, such as an armoured roller door,

sectional door leaf or similar, having a door leaf
shaft (6) which is connected by means of gears to

the door leaf, to which the drive shaft (26) of a
drive motor unit (5) which is incorporated in a

drive housing (25) is connected in series via a
torque transfer mechanism incorporated in a

transmission housing (2, 3), which has an input
shaft (7) connected with the drive shaft (26) of

the drive motor unit (5) and an output shaft (8)
connected with the door leaf shaft (6), wherein the

input shaft (7) and the output shaft (8), from the
point of view of the longitudinal axes of these

shafts, are at a distance which represents a
multiple of the sum of the radius of the gear

wheels (12, 13; 27, 28) on these shafts which are
in geared connection with one another,

characterised in that the drive housing (25) of the
drive motor unit (5) is held in place and is

connected in a torsionally-rigid manner with the
transmission housing (2, 3) of the torque transfer

mechanism (29, 30) in such a way that torque
between the door leaf shaft (6) and the drive shaft

(26) is taken up in the manner of a rigid lever.
A drive mechanism according to claim 1,

characterised in that during transfer of torque
from the input shaft (7) to the output shaft (8),

at least a part of the speed translation from the
drive shaft (26) to the door leaf shaft (6) is

arranged within the transfer housing (2, 3).
A drive mechanism according to claim 2,

characterised in that the gearing input shaft (7) 
and the gearing output shaft (8) each have a gear

wheel (12, 13), that one or more intermediary
shafts (9, 10, 11) are disposed between the gearing

input shaft (7) and the gearing output shaft (8),
which each have a pair of gear wheels of different

diameter (14, 15/16, 17/18, 19), which are
torsionally-fixed in relation to each other, and

that viewed from the gearing input shaft (7), a
gear wheel of smaller diameter (12, 15, 17, 19) is

connected to a gear wheel of greater diameter (14,
16, 18, 13) of the next shaft in the geartrain (9,

10, 11, 8) via an endless chain or belt driving
member which winds around one of these two gear

wheels (12, 14/15, 16/17, 18/19, 13), wherein
especially the axes of all shafts (7 to 11) are

arranged to run in parallel and approximately in
one plane.
A drive mechanism according to claim 1,

characterised in that a gear wheel (27) arranged on
the input shaft (7) is directly connected to a gear

wheel (28) on the output shaft (8) via a gearing
member in the fashion of an endless belt,

especially an endless chain.
A drive mechanism according to one of claims 1 to
4, characterised in that the drive housing (25) can

be fixable to the transmission housing (2, 3) at a
variety of selectable angle settings (29, 30).
A drive mechanism according to claim 5,

characterised in that the drive housing (25) has
drilled holes (29) arranged at a distance along a

circular arc which correspond with at least one
appropriately-arranged drilled hole in the

transmission housing (2, 3), depending on angle
setting, and which are pierced by a common bolt.
