<ABSTRACT>
Device for the discharge of material, in particular 
cohesive material, from a stock container (1). The device 

comprises a wall (2) defining a space in communication with 
or forming the stock container, at least the bottom part of 

the wall of the device being formed by two end wall parts 
(5) and a wall part (3) of substantially circular cross 

section along the length thereof extending between the end 
wall parts. At least one discharge opening (6) is provided 

in the bottom part of the wall of the device. The device 
further comprises first flow-promotion means (8), which 

move along the at least one discharge opening (6) 
essentially parallel to the part (5) of the wall (2) 

bounding the at least one discharge opening, and second 
flow-promotion means (9) which move along virtually the 

entire length of the wall part (3) of substantially 
circular cross-section extending between the end wall 

parts. Also drive means (11) are provided for moving the 
first and second flow-promotion means.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a device for the
discharge of material, particularly cohesive material, from
a stock container according to the preamble of claim 1.Such a device is e.g. known from US 4,273,296. The
known device is in particular designed for blowing
insulation materal which is conveyed to the discharge
opening of the device by means of a rotating hopper blade
assembly. A first pair of blades of the blade assembly
moves along the discharge opening essentially parallel to
the end wall. The other blade pairs of the blade assembly
are distributed over the length of the wall part of
substantially circular cross-section. The blades have a
blade pitch to obtain an auger action towards the discharge
opening.The abovementioned known device is hardly suitable
for the discharge of cohesive material as the blades exert
a compacting effect on the material to be discharged, with
the result that the flow properties thereof are adversely
affected. Another disadvantage of the known device is that,
in the case of various materials, in particular after the
material has been standing for several days in the stock
container, there is a risk that compacted material which
rests on the wall part of substantially circular cross-section
cannot be brought into motion by the blade pairs
which are spaced from one another and discharge of this
material does not take place.The object of the present invention is to eliminate
the abovementioned problems.This object is achieved by a device of the type
mentioned in the preamble of claim 1, which is
characterized in that the second flow-promotion means move
along virtually the entire length of the wall part of
substantially circular cross-section extending between the
end wall parts. This ensures that there are no "dead"
corners present in the device where material can remain 
behind for a fairly long time. This is important in
particular in the case of perishable materials, for example
in the food industry. The movement of the first flow-promotion
means over the discharge opening(s) and the part
of the wall lying around said opening(s) ensures that the
material is kept moving there, so that it can flow out of
the discharge opening(s) without problems. During the
movement the first flow-promotion means can contact the
wall or be situated a short distance from it. What is
important is that the first flow-promotion means do not
compact (compress) the material, which would adversely
affect the flow properties of the material. The second
flow-promotion means according to the
