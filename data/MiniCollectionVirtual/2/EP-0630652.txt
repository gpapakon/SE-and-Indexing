<ABSTRACT>
There are provided improved diagnostic metal containing 
molecular sieves for use as contrast agents in diagnostic 

imaging techniques such as X-ray, scintigraphy and, 
especially, MRI. For MRI the diagnostic metals are 

paramagnetic metal ions. Reduced risk of toxic metal 
release in vivo, especially into the GI tract, is achieved 

by surface modification of the molecular sieve.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to the use of molecular sieves 
as contrast agents in diagnostic imaging procedures and in 
particular in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Contrast agents may be administered in medical 
imaging procedures, for example X-ray, magnetic resonance 
and ultrasound imaging, to enhance the image contrast in 
images of a subject, generally a human or non-human animal 
body. The resulting enhanced contrast enables different 
organs, tissue types or body compartments to be more 
clearly observed or identified. In X-ray imaging the 
contrast agents function by modifying the X-ray absorption 
characteristics of the body sites in which they 
distribute; magnetic resonance contrast agents generally 
function by modifying the characteristic relaxation times 
T₁ and T₂ of the nuclei, generally water protons, from the 
resonance signals of which the images are generated; and 
ultrasound contrast agents function by modifying the speed 
of sound or the density in the body sites into which they 
distribute. The X-ray contrast agents first developed, barium 
sulfate and sodium iodide, have been superseded by 
iodinated organic compounds, in particular triiodophenyl 
compounds. Improvements in systemic toxicity over the 
last 40 years have also been achieved by the development 
of non-ionic iodinated X-ray contrast agents (see Shaw in 
"Radiopaques", CRC Handbook of Vitamins, Hormone and 
Radiopaques, CRC Press, p. 229-243). As the X-ray absorption cross-sections of the 
elements generally increase with increasing atomic number 
and as such cross-sections are dependent on the wavelength 
of the X-rays there has been some desire to utilize the X-ray 
absorption properties of the lanthanides and other 
high atomic number metals to develop contrast agents with 
improved X-ray attenuation especially at the wavelengths  
 
used in CT; however these attempts have generally been 
relatively unsuccessful. Thus, for example, Nalbandian et al. (see Ann. N.Y. 
Acad. Sci. 78: 779 (1959)) and Shapiro et al. (see Ann. 
N.Y. Acad. Sci. 78: 756 (1959)) proposed the use of the 
diethylenetetraaminepentaacetic acid (DTPA) chelate of 
bismuth (BiDTPA) and the ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid 
(EDTA) chelate of lead (PbEDTA) as radiographic contrast 
agents but encountered problems of solubility and 
toxicity. In US-A-4176173 Winchell et al. described the 
use of simple hafnium or tantalum complexes as X-ray 
contrast agents and, more recently, ytterbium DTPA has 
been studied as an intravascular X-ray contrast agent and
