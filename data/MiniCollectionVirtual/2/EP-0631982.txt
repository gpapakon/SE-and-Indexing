<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to aggregates of particles
of which a portion of the particles is of silicon
dioxide and to elastomers reinforced therewith.In one aspect, the invention relates to tires
having rubber treads which are composed of such
reinforced elastomers.Silica, which is primarily composed of silicon
dioxide, is often used to reinforce various
elastomers, particularly when used in conjunction with
a silica coupling agent, or silica coupler.The silica, or silicon dioxide which is its major
constituent, is typically used in the form of an
aggregate of the fine silica particles which are
bonded together due primarily to the manner in which
they are prepared, particularly when the silica is
prepared by a precipitation process. In such
aggregate form, the primary silica particles are
typically sufficiently bonded together so that even
upon application of a relatively high shear mixing of
silica/rubber mixtures, at least a portion of the
aggregate structure remains and the aggregate is not
completely broken down to its ultimate primary silica
particles. This phenomenon is considered herein to be
known to those skilled in the silica/rubber mixing
art.Therefore, silica typically used for rubber
reinforcement purposes, while referred to as "silica",
it might be more appropriately referred to as
aggregates of silica particles.In one aspect, the invention also relates to
tires having rubber treads which are composed of
elastomers which are reinforced with aggregates of 
silica particles of which at least a portion of the
particles are of silicon dioxide.Various rubber products, including tires and
industrial products, are composed of elastomers, or
blends of elastomers, which are conventionally
reinforced with reinforcing particulate fillers to
enhance their physical properties.While carbon black is often used for such
purpose, silica is also sometimes solely used or,
alternatively, is used in conjunction with carbon
black to reinforce the elastomers and/or to otherwise
enhance their physical properties. The use of carbon
black and/or silica to reinforce elastomers is well
known to those having skill in such art.Such silica is normally composed primarily of
silicon dioxide which contains silanol groups on its
surface as well as water of adsorption unless it is
used in a dried or dehydrated form. While the silica
can be, for example, of the pyrogenic or precipitated
type, the precipitated silica is used in most
applications.As hereinbefore pointed out, for rubber
reinforcement purposes, the silica,
