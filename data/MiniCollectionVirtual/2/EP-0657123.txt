<ABSTRACT>
A flat-type lifting element constructed as a furniture drive is to be designed in a structurally simple way so that it is extremely compact, but relatively highly loadable and universally usable. According to the invention, the flat-type lifting element (10) comprises an outer and an inner hollow-section rail (11, 12) with closed cross-section. The width is substantially greater than the thickness. It also includes an electric-motor actuating drive (13), whose linearly movable drive member (15) is coupled to the outer or inner hollow-section rail (11, 12). The mutually facing faces of the outer and inner hollow-section rail (11, 12) can be provided with interlocking profilings extending in the direction of movement of the extendable hollow-section rail (11 or 12). The flat-type lifting element according to the invention is particularly suitable for furniture drives.

A flat lifting element, in particular for articles of
furniture, comprising an outer and an inner hollow profile bar (11, 12) of

closed cross-sections and each of greater width than thickness and
comprising an electric-motor adjusting drive (13) characterised in that

the linearly movable output member (15) of the adjusting drive (13) is
directly coupled to the outer or inner hollow profile bar (11, 12), that

the inner and the outer hollow profile bars (11, 12) are substantially
smooth-surfaced and of similar cross-section, and that the outer hollow

profile bar (11) embraces the inner hollow profile bar (12) substantially
over the full surface area thereof.
A flat lifting element according to claim 1 characterised in
that the mutually oppositely disposed outer longitudinal side regions of

the two hollow profile bars (11, 12) extend in an arc, preferably a
semicircle.
A flat lifting element according to claim 2 characterised in
that the longitudinal side regions are formed by tubes of circular cross-section

which are connected together by flat portions.
A flat lifting element according to claim 3 characterised in
that the mutually facing surfaces of the inner and outer hollow profile

bars (11, 12) are provided with interengaging profile portions which
extend in the direction of movement of the extensible hollow profile bar

(11) or (12) and which are formed from groove-like recesses (19) provided
at least at one wide side of the inner hollow profile bar (12) and flange

portions (20) which engage into the recesses (19) and which are disposed
on the facing inward side of the outer hollow profile bar (11).
A flat lifting element according to one or more of preceding
claims 1 or 4 characterised in that the cross-sections of the outer and

inner hollow profile bars (11, 12) are rectangular, that the thicknesses 
of the narrow sides are greater than those of the wide sides, and that at

least one screw-in groove (21) which is open at one side and which is of
circular cross-section is disposed in each narrow side.
A flat lifting element according to one or more of preceding
claims 1 to 5 characterised in that the widths to the thicknesses of the

two hollow profile bars (11, 12) are in a ratio of about 5:1.
A flat lifting element according to claim 1 characterised in
that provided on the inside in the outer hollow profile bar (11) are

grooves which extend in the longitudinal direction and into which are
fixedly inserted guide bar portions (17) whose surfaces that contact the

outside surface of the inner hollow profile bar (12) project with respect
to the inside surface of the outer hollow profile bar (11).
A flat lifting element according to claim 1 characterised in
that provided on the outside in the inner hollow profile bar (12) are

grooves which extend in the longitudinal direction and into which are
fixedly inserted guide bar portions (17) whose surfaces that contact the

inside surface of the outer hollow profile bar (11) project relative to
the outside surface of the inner hollow profile bar (12).
A flat lifting element according to claim 7 or claim 8
characterised in that the guide bar portions (17) are provided in the two

mutually oppositely disposed outer longitudinal side regions.
A flat lifting element according to claim 1 in which the inner
hollow profile bar (12) is coupled to the output member (15) of the

electric-motor drive (13), characterised in that provided in at least one
wall of the outer hollow profile bar (11) is at least one slot (25)

extending in the direction of movement of the inner hollow profile bar
(12). 
A flat lifting element according to one or more of preceding
claims 1 to 10 characterised in that the outer hollow profile bar (11) and

the inner hollow profile bar (12) comprise a light metal, preferably
aluminium, and the guide bars (17) comprise a plastics material.
A flat lifting element according to one or more of preceding
claims 1 to 11 characterised in that the electric-motor adjusting drive

(13) includes a rotatingly drivable screwthreaded spindle (14) and that
the output member is a nut (15) which is fixed to the outer or inner

hollow profile bar (11, 12).
A flat lifting element according to one or more of preceding
claims 1 to 12 characterised in that the outside surface of the inner

hollow profile bar (12) and the inside surface of the outer hollow profile
bar (11) are each entirely or partially provided with a friction-reducing

coating.
A flat lifting element according to one or more of preceding
claims 1 to 13 characterised in that the screwthreaded spindle (14) of the

electric-motor drive (13) is drivingly connected to the motor transmission
unit (16) or the drive motor by way of a flexible drive means, preferably

by way of a flexible shaft.
