<ABSTRACT>
A telephone base (10) is provided with a bay (26) for 
receiving an electronic module (60). The base is formed 

with two guide extensions which define the bay between 
them and act to guide a module into the bay. Modules 

may thus be interchangeable and small compared to the 
base while providing different electronic functions. 

Retaining features for a module is incorporated to 
prevent accidental release of a module from the bay, 

e.g. as by dropping. Frictional engagement between the 
module and the base may provide the retaining features.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to telephone bases. A telephone comprises, in the main, a handset 
which is carried, when not in use, upon a telephone base so 
as to hold a hook switch of the phone in an "off" position. 
Either the base or the handset may include a telephone key 
pad or rotary dial for phone operation. Telephones of specific design are already known 
which may be used with interchangeable electronic modules 
for providing a variety of different electronic functions 
to the telephones. In such specific designs which have 
been available for about twenty years, the modules and the 
telephone bases are located side-by-side upon a support 
surface such as a desk top while being electrically 
interconnected. A problem attendant with such telephone 
base and module designs and arrangements is that they are 
extraordinarily bulky, the bulkiness becoming greater upon 
assembly of module and telephone base. For aesthetic 
reasons, the modules have been designed with substantially 
the same profile as the telephone bases to which they are 
to be connected so as to match module with telephone base 
and give the impression that base and module assembly is a 
single structure. Such an aesthetic requirement has 
contributed to a large extent to the bulkiness of the 
assembly. In addition, the bulkiness of such telephone 
bases and module arrangements is attended by undesirable 
heaviness of the components which are not easily handled in 
their assembled form without becoming detached from one 
another. Also inordinate amounts of material are required 
for making housing parts for both the telephone bases and 
the modules. The present invention seeks to provide a telephone 
base and a base and module combination which may minimize 
the above problems and disadvantages. According to one aspect of the present invention 
there is provided a telephone base formed with a bay for 
receiving and supporting an electronic module within the  
 
base, the base also having an electrical connector for 
electrical connection to the electronic module when the 
module is disposed within the bay. With the above base according to the invention the 
module is received and supported within the bay. Thus, the 
module is of necessity of smaller structure than the 
telephone base thereby minimizing the overall size of the 
assembly and the base. Hence, as the module is supported 
by the base, the module does not require the height 
requirements of the base while the module may still follow 
and blend with the profile of the base

<CLAIMS>
A telephone base formed with a bay for 
supporting an electronic module in an operational 

position within the base, guide means having an entrance 
for accepting into the operational position, a module 

previously detached from the base and for detachment of 
the module from the operational position and from the 

base, the bay having an open top to expose an upper 
surface of the module when the module is disposed in its 

operational position, means for removably retaining the 
module in its operational position within the base, the 

retaining means capable of being overcome when a 
positive detaching force is applied to the module so as 

to enable removal of the module completely from the 
telephone base. 
A telephone base according to claim 1, 
characterised in that the means for removably retaining 

the module comprises surface means of the base for 
frictionally engaging the module to resist removal of 

the module from the bay. 
A telephone base according to claim 2, 
characterised in that the base comprises a body and that 

the guide means comprise two guide extensions of the 
body extending laterally outwardly of the body in spaced 

apart positions one on each side of the bay, ends of the 
extensions remote from the body defining the entrance 

into the bay for the module. 
A telephone base according to claim 3, 
characterised in that the extensions are formed with 

guide slots for receiving the module into the bay, and 
that the means for removably retaining the module 

comprises surface means at entrance ends of the slots 
for frictionally engaging the module to resist removal 

of the module from the bay. 
A telephone base according to claim 4, 
characterised in that each extension is formed by two 

mating housing parts which define a guide slot between 
them, one of the housing parts having a registration 

flange registered within the other housing part with an 
end of the registration flange providing a surface means 

at the entrance end of the slot for frictionally 
engaging the module. 
A telephone base according to claim 4, 
characterised in that the remote ends of the extensions 

are resiliently flexible apart to permit movement of the 
module between the surface means. 
A telephone base according to claim 6, 
characterised in that the base is provided with a bottom 

wall extending between the extensions and defining a 
lower boundary to the bay, the bottom wall being 

resiliently flexible to permit resilient flexing 
movement apart of the extensions. 
A telephone base according to claim 4, 
characterised in that the base is provided with a bottom 

wall extending between the extensions and defining a 
boundary to the bay, and the bottom wall has a low 

intermediate region between edge regions which connect 
the intermediate region to the extensions, one of the 

edge regions being inclined to the intermediate region, 
and a stand is provided for the base, the stand 

locatable in one position in engagement with said one 
edge region of the base to support the bottom wall, and 

in another position in engagement with the intermediate 
region of the base to support the bottom wall. 
A combination of a telephone base and an 
electronic module wherein the telephone base is formed 

with a bay which is open at the top, guide means leading 
to the bay and having an entrance to the guide means, 

 
the module being acceptable from a detached position 

from the base, through the entrance, and along the guide 
means and into an operational position within the bay 

with an upper surface of the module exposed through the 
open top of the bay, the telephone base also having 

means for removably retaining the module in its 
operational position within the bay, the retaining means 

capable of being overcome when a positive detaching 
force is applied to the module to enable removal of the 

module completely from the telephone base. 
A combination according to claim 9, 
characterised in that the base comprises a body and two 

module guide extensions extend horizontally outwardly 
from the body in spaced apart position, one on each side 

of the bay, the extensions having ends remote from the 
body, the remote ends defining the entrance into the bay 

for the module. 
A combination according to claim 10, 
characterised in that the extensions are formed with 

guide slots and that the module is provided with guide 
rails for guiding the module along the slots during 

movement of the module into and out of the bay, and that 
the means for removably retaining the module comprises 

surface means at entrance ends of the slots for 
frictionally engaging the module to resist removal of 

the module from the bay. 
A combination according to claim 11, 
characterised in that each extension is formed by two 

mating housing parts which define a guide slot between

flange registered with the other housing part with an 
end of the registration flange providing a surface means 

at the entrance end of the slot for frictionally 
engaging the module. 
A combination according to claim 11,

module between the surface means causes resilient 

flexing apart of the remote ends to permit movement of

wall extending between the extensions and defining a 
lower boundary to the bay, and that the module has a
