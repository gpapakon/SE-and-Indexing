<ABSTRACT>
Pulps or papers, especially chemimechanical or thermomechanical pulps or papers, which still contain lignin, have enhanced resistance to yellowing when they contain an effective stabilizing amount of a hindered amine compound which preferably is a nitroxide, a hydroxylamine or an ammonium salt thereof. This performance is often further enhanced by the presence of one or more coadditives selected from the group consisting of the UV absorbers, the polymeric inhibitors, the nitrones, the fluorescent whitening agents, metal chelating agents, sulfur containing stabilizers, metal salts and diene compounds. Combinations of nitroxides, hydroxylamines or their salts, benzotriazole or benzophenone UV absorbers and a metal chelating agent are particularly effective. Selected derivatives of 1-oxyl-2,2,6,6-tetramethylpiperidin-4-ol and selected hydroxylamine salts are novel compounds and are surprisingly effective for this purpose.

<DESCRIPTION>
 INHIBITION OF PULP AND PAPER YELLOWING USING NITROXIDES AND OTHER COADDITIVESThe instant invention pertains to a method for preventing the loss of brightness and for enhancing resistance to yellowing in pulp or paper which still contains lignin by the addition of nitroxides, hydroxylamines or their salts and other coadditives. The instant invention also pertains to novel compounds which are selected derivatives of 1 -oxyI-2,2,6,6-tetramethyl- piperidin-4-ol or which are their hydroxylamine salts.Background of the InventionHigh-yield and ultra-high yield wood pulps undergo rapid light-induced discoloration, particularly when they are exposed to near ultraviolet light (wave lengths 300-400 nm) in indoor fluorescent light and daylight. This characteristic restricts their use to short-life, low-value paper products. High-yield and ultra-high yield wood pulps can be bleached to a high level of whiteness. If this whiteness could be stabilized against discoloration, these bleached high-yield pulps could displace significant amounts of more expensive fully-bleached, low-yield chemical pulps.This discoloration is ascribed to the substantial lignin content of high-yield pulps totaling about 20-45% by mass. Phenoxy radicals are the key intermediates in the reaction mechanism. Several light-induced reactions have been proposed to account for their formation such as abstraction of a hydrogen atom from phenolic groups, cleavage of the aryl ether bond of phenacyl aryl ether groups, or breakdown of ketyl radicals formed from saturated aryl-glycerol β-aryl ether structures in lignin. The phenoxy radicals are oxidized by other oxygen-centered radicals (alkoxy, peroxy, hydroxy and perhydroxy) to form yellow chromophores. (C. Heitner in "Photochemistry of Lignocellulosic Materials", C. Heitner, J.C. Scaiano, eds,: ACS Sym. Ser. 531 , 1-25 (1993).)I. E. Arakin et al., Khymiya drevesiny (Chemistry of Wood), 1982, No. 2, 114 and A. D. Sergeev et al., ibid, 1984, No. 5, 20 disclosed that the use of iminoxyl radicals such as TEMPO (1-oxyl-2,2,6,6-tetramethylpiperidine) is useful in the delignification of wood using the one-stage oxygen-soda (alkaline) process, but made no mention or suggestion of any activity provided by 

TEMPO on preventing light-induced discoloration of paper or pulp made from such treated wood.EP 717,143 and WO 97/36041 describe a multicomponent system for changing, reducing or bleaching lignin and lignin-containing materials which comprise a oxidation catalyst, and a N- hydroxyl mediator compound such as
