<ABSTRACT>
It is proposed to drive a real or virtual slave system with p degrees of freedom by means of a manual control device comprising a grip (10) formed of an active component (12) and of one or two information-return components (14). A displacement of speed sensor (24) can be mounted in the active component (12) in order to generate signals used in driving the slave system. Actuators mounted for example in a support linked to the grip (10) by a flexible cord (22) receive information from the slave system and transform it into a torque. This torque is transmitted to the information-return component (14), for example by cables (30, 34), so that a force representative of the information originating from the slave system is applied to the hand of the operator.

Manual control member of a slave system incorporating: 

a handle (10) including an outer surface mainly formed by an active part 
(12) and at least one information return part (14) separate from the active 

part and mobile with respect thereto, 
means (24) for controlling movements of the slave system in response to an 
action on the active part (12) of the handle (10), independently of the 

position of the information return part with respect to said active part and 
means (28) for controlling movements of each information return part (14) 
relative to the active part (12), in response to information return signals 

from the slave system. 
Manual control member according to claim 1, wherein the slave system has p 
degrees of freedom, the handle (10) has q information return parts (14) and 

each information return part has r degrees of freedom with respect to the 
active part, with r

p. 
Manual control member according to claim 2, wherein the number q of information 
return parts (14) is at the most two. 
Manual control member according to any one of the preceding claims, wherein 
there is also a support (20) independent of the movement control means (24) 

of the slave system and wherein the movement control means of each information 
return part (14) incorporate at least one actuator (28) mounted in said support 

(20) and movement transmission means (30, 34) connecting the actuator (28) to 
the information return part (14). 
Manual control member according to claim 4, wherein the active part (12) 
of the handle (10) is connected to the support (20) by a flexible cord (22) 

in which pass the movement transmission means (30, 34). 
Manual control member according to claim 4, wherein the active part (12) 
of the handle is mechanically connected to the support (20) by an articulated 

arm (52).  
 
Control member according to any one of the claims 4 to 6, wherein the 
movement transmission means incorporate at least two cables (34) able to slide 

in sheaths (32, 36), a first (34) of said cables connecting a first actuator 
(28) to each information return part (14) through a movement inversion means 

(38, 40) and at least one second (30) of said cables directly connecting a 
second actuator (28) to each information return part. 
Control member according to claims 2 and 7 combined, comprising p second 
cables (30) and p second actuators. 
Control member according to any one of the claims 1 to 3, wherein the 
movement control means of each information return part (14) comprise at least 

one actuator mounted in the handle (10). 
Control member according to any one of the preceding claims, wherein the 
handle (10) comprises a single information return part (14). 
Control member according to claim 10, wherein the information return part 
(14) forms an end portion of the handle (10). 
Control member according to claim 10, wherein the information return part 
(14) forms a central portion of the handle (10) interposed between two portions 

of the active part (12). 
Control member according to claim 10, wherein the information return part 
(14) has several protuberances located in openings (13) formed in the active 

part (12). 
Control member according to any one of the claims 1 to 9, wherein the 
handle (10) comprises two information return parts (14a, 14b). 
Control member according to any one of the preceding claims, wherein the 
information return part (14) carries at least one button (42) for controlling 

the coupling of the control member to the slave system. 
Control member according to any one of the preceding claims, wherein the 
handle (10) carries at least one display.
