<ABSTRACT>
The invention describes a tracheostomy closure which comprises a valve that can be deliberately operated in order to permit the patient to speak, a cannula to be introduced into the stoma of the patient and having a closure member in the trachea and a valve housing (1) which seals the cannula toward the outside. In order to ensure a satisfactory retention in the trachea the closure member is designed as an arched extension (4) of the cannula (2). The arched extension (4) is inserted in the trachea in the direction of the lungs, so that the flow losses on respiration are minimised and breathing is possible without impairment. A support plate (5), which is preferably pushed with an adapted opening (6) onto the cannula (2), also covers a large and sunken stoma, so that satisfactory sealing toward the outside is possible even in difficult cases.
