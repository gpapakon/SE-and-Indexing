<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates with a bipolar power
transistor with high collector breakdown voltage and a related
manufacturing process.It is known that in bipolar power transistors fabricated by
planar technology, the collector region sustains almost the
entire reverse voltage applied to the base-collector junction.
This is a consequence of the electric field distribution across
the junction, depending on the doping concentration profile of
the transistor's base region, which, in the case of an NPN
transistor, is obtained by diffusion of a high concentration of
boron into a lightly doped N- epitaxial layer constituting the
transistor's collector region.Because of such limitation, the structure used for today
high voltage bipolar transistors is not the planar one, but the
so-called "mesa": this name stems from the fact that each
transistor resembles a little mesa whose vertical walls
terminate the base-collector junction.One of the basic technologies by which mesa transistors are
fabricated is known as MultiEpitaxial Mesa (MEM); in the MEM
technology, described for example in pages 29-32, Solid State
Technology, March 1976, the base region comprises a lightly
doped P- epitaxial layer, grown over an N- epitaxial layer
(from which the name of the technology) and in which a P+
region is diffused; the corresponding base doping concentration
profile causes a significant percentage of the total reverse
voltage applied to the base-collector junction to be sustained 
by the P- epitaxial portion of the base region, and not only by
the N- epitaxial collector. The electric field distribution in
both the base and the collector regions determines some of the
electrical characteristics of the transistor such as the gain
dependance on the collector current and the ruggedness in
secondary breakdown and in direct breakdown.Even though this technology allows the fabrication of
transistors with collector breakdown voltages up to 2000V, it
involves the passivation of the base-collector junction with
glass, which is deposited, by means of a complex and expensive
process, in an annular moat obtained by etching the silicon
down to the N- epitaxial layer; such moat, circumscribing each
transistor to isolate its base from the other transistors'
bases, gives rise to the mesa structure of the transistor. As a
consequence, mesa transistors show low reliability with respect
to transistors obtained by planar technologies, wherein the
base-collector junction is passivated by means of thermal
oxide.US-A-4,074,293 discloses a bipolar
