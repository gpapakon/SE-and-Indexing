<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a use for treating or for
preventing the depletion of calcium from bones as a result of
osteoporosis.More specifically, this invention relates to a use for
treating or preventing various known forms of osteoporosis, e.g.
postmenopausal, senile and steroid-induced osteoporosis, one of
the characteristics of which is the loss of bone mass.It is well known that females at the time of menopause
suffer a marked loss of bone mass giving rise ultimately to
osteopenia, which in turn gives rise to spontaneous crush
fractures of the vertebrae and fractures of the long bones. This
disease is generally known as postmenopausal osteoporosis and
presents a major medical problem, both in the United States
and most other countries where the life-span of females reaches
ages of at least 60 and 70 years. Generally, the disease which is
often accompanied by bone pain and decreased physical activity,
is diagnosed by one or two vertebral crush fractures with
evidence of diminished bone mass. It is known that this disease
is accompanied by diminished ability to absorb calcium,
decreased levels of sex hormones, especially estrogen and
androgen, and a negative calcium balance.Similar symptoms of bone loss characterize senile
osteoporosis and steroid-induced osteoporosis, the latter being
a recognized result of long term glucocorticoid (cortico-steroid)
therapy for certain disease states.Methods for treating the disease have varied considerably
but to date no totally satisfactory treatment is yet known. A
conventional treatment is to administer a calcium supplement to
the patient. However, calcium supplementation by itself has not
been successful in preventing or curing the disease. Another
conventional treatment is the injection of sex hormones,
especially estrogen, which has been reported to be effective in
preventing the rapid loss of bone mass experienced in 
postmenopausal women. This technique, however, has been
complicated by the fear of its possible carcinogenicity. Other
treatments for which variable results have been reported, have
included a combination of vitamin D in large doses, calcium and
fluoride. The primary problem with this approach is that
fluoride induces structurally unsound bone, called woven bone,
and in addition, produces a number of side effects such as
increased incidence of fractures and gastrointestinal reaction to
the large amounts of fluoride administered. Another suggested
method is to block bone resorption by injecting calcitonin or
providing phosphonates.U. S.-A- No.
