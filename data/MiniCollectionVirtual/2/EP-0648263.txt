<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to novel microorganisms
and to novel enzymes obtainable therefrom. More specifically,
the invention relates to a new species of the genus Hyphozyma,
and to novel lipases obtainable therefrom.The invention also relates to a process for obtaining
the enzymes, immobilized lipase preparations, and industrial
applications of these enzymes in the paper pulp industry, for
use in ester hydrolysis, ester synthesis or interesterification,
and for manufacture of leather.When resinous wood species are used in pulping
processes, particularly mechanical pulping processes, pitch
problems arise. This widespread phenomenon causes production
interruptions and a decreased paper product quality.Pitch contains considerable amounts of triglycerides,
more commonly known as fats, and other esters. Fatty acid
glyceride hydrolysing enzymes, in the following called lipases,
may advantageously be used for efficient hydrolysis of water-insoluble
esters, particularly triglycerides.In order to comply with the prerequisite for paper pulp
processing, lipases applied in methods for enzymatic pitch
control should be acidophilic and thermophilic.Enzymes suggested in the prior art for pitch control
include lipases derived from strains of Pseudomonas, Humicola,
Candida, Chromobacter and Aspergillus.Some of these lipases are markedly thermophilic, others
are markedly acidophilic, but none of these lipases possess
both characteristics.Hyphozyma is a new genus of yeast-like Hyphomycetes
(vide de Hoog, G.S & Smith, M.Th. ; Antonie van Leeuwenhoek 47
(1981) 339-352), and the following species are reported: H.
variabilis, H. variabilis var. odora, H. sanguinea, and H.roseoniger. However, no lipase production has previously been
ascribed to these organisms.We have now found that a new species of Hyphozyma is
able to produce lipase. Moreover, we have found that these
novel lipases possess excellent paper pulp processing
possibilities due to their markedly thermophilic and
acidophilic characteristics. Moreover, we have also found that
these novel lipases are well suited for use in ester
hydrolysis, ester synthesis or interesterification, and various
other industrial applications. In its first aspect, the present invention provides a
lipolytic enzyme comprising the following partial amino acid
sequence: Gly Ser Gly Xaa Xbb Lys Xaa Xaa Xaa Xaa Xaa Xaa Ser*
Gln Gly Gly; in which sequence Ser* represents the
catalytically active serine, Xaa represents any of the
naturally occurring amino acids, and Xbb represents a
