<ABSTRACT>
Apparatus for developing synchronization of an 
intermediate layer of signal such as the transport or multiplex 

layer of a multi-layered compressed video signal, includes at the 
encoding end of the system apparatus (13,23,25) for including a 

time stamp reference, such as a count value from a modulo K 
counter (23), and provision for a differential time stamp which 

may be updated by the transit times of respective (e.g., 
multiplexing) circuits as the signal transits such circuits. At the 

receiving end of the system a counter (27) is responsive to a 
controlled receiver clock signal and the count value of this counter 

is sampled at the arrival of the time stamps embedded in the 
transport layer. The time stamps and the differential time stamps 

are retrieved from the signal and combined to form a corrected 
time stamp. The differences of successive sampled count values 

of the receiver counter are compared with the differences of 
corresponding successive corrected time stamps to provide a 

signal to control the receiver clock signal.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a method and apparatus for
providing a compressed video signal.Compressed video signal generation and transmission
systems may operate on several levels of synchronization or
perhaps more properly called asynchronization. For example the
actual compression apparatus will be synchronized, at least in part
to the vertical frame rate of the source video signal, and it may
also be synchronized to the color subcarrier. Once the video signal
is compressed and formed into a particular signal protocol, such as
MPEG 1, it may be further processed into transport packets for
transmission. The transport packets may be time division
multiplexed with packets from other video or data sources. The
packetizing and multiplexing may or may not be done in a
mutually synchronous fashion, which may or may not be
synchronous with the compression operation. The transport
packets (whether multiplexed or not) may thereafter be supplied
to a modem for transmission of the data. The modem may or may
not operate synchronously with the prior mentioned systems.At the receiver of a fully multiplexed transmitted
compressed signal, it is usually necessary that the various
subsystems operate synchronously with their inverse function
counterpart elements at the encoding end of the system.
Synchronous operation in this case, in general, may mean that the
respective subsystems operate extremely close to the same
frequencies as their counterpart subsystems. For example, the
decompressor should provide video signal at the same frame rate
as provided by the video signal source at the compressor, and
synchronized with associated audio. Synchronization of the
video/audio decompression portion of the system may be
accomplished by inserting, at the encoder, presentation time
stamps within the compressed video/audio signals, that indicate
the relative times of production/reproduction of respective
segments of signal. Such presentation time references, PTR's, may
be used to compare the timing of associated audio and video 
signals for synchronization purposes and for proper sequencing
and continuity.Document WO-A-84/00268 concerns time stamping for a packet switching
system.Document EP-A-0488225 concerns a clock information transmitting device.The receiver modem must of course operate at the
precise frequency as the transmitting modem. Receiver modems
typically include phase locked loops responsive to the transmitted
carrier frequencies for generating synchronous clock signals.Synchronization of the multiplexing and or
