<ABSTRACT>
This invention provides a process for the stable and low 
cost production of docosahexaenoic acid having no fishy 

smells in which docosahexaenoic acid is extracted from cells 
of a marine microalga produced by a continuous liquid culture 

process which is effective in producing docosahexaenoic acid 
in high concentration industrially stably. 
Particularly, it provides a process for the culturing of 
marine microalgae which comprises continuously culturing a 

marine microalga in a liquid medium under aerated and 
agitated conditions, thereby producing algal cells of the 

marine microalga, and a process for the production of 
docosahexaenoic acid which comprises extracting 

docosahexaenoic acid from the algal cells produced by the 
marine microalgae production process.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a process for the production 
of a polyunsaturated fatty acid, docosahexaenoic acid (to be 
referred to as "DHA" hereinafter), which is possessed of 
noteworthy physiological functions such as a cholesterol 
reducing effect, an anticoagulant effect and a carcinostatic 
effect, as well as its brain metabolism-related effects in 
improving memory and learning capacities, preventing senile 
dementia and treating Alzheimer disease and its effect as an 
essential fatty acid for the growth of juvenile fish.
 
Particularly, it relates to a process for the production of 
DHA which comprises continuously culturing marine microalgae 
(marine algae of microscopic forms) efficiently in a large 
quantity and producing DHA from the thus cultured marine 
microalgal cells stably with a low cost. More specifically, this invention relates to a process 
for the production of marine microalgae which comprises 
producing algal cells of a marine microalga by continuously 
culturing said marine microalga under aerated and agitated 
conditions, and to a process for the production of DHA which 
comprises continuously culturing a marine microalga under 
aerated and agitated conditions and extracting DHA from the 
resulting algal cells.  Though it is known that DHA having various 
physiologically active functions is contained in fish oil, 
its practical use has been delayed due to difficulties in 
separating and extracting it from fish oil. In recent years, 
studies have been conducted in earnest on the elucidation of 
the physiologically active functions of DHA and practical 
application thereof, triggered by the finding of the presence 
of high concentration DHA in tuna orbit fat and the like 
among various fish oil sources and by the development of 
efficient fatty acid purification techniques. With regard to the purification and use of DHA, a large 
number of reports have been published, such as on an agent 
for the prevention and treatment of thrombosis (JP-A-57-183716; 
the term "JP-A" as used herein means an "unexamined 
published Japanese patent application), a process for the 
separation and purification of polyunsaturated fatty acids or 
esters thereof (JP-A-61-37752), a carcinostatic composition 
containing a polyunsaturated fatty acid (JP-A-63-258816), a 
process for the separation and purification of 
polyunsaturated fatty acid alkyl esters (JP-A-63-8356), a 
carcinostatic agent containing docosahexaenoyl monoglyceride 
as an active ingredient (JP-A-1-203322), a brain function 
enhancing
