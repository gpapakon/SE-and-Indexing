<ABSTRACT>
A self-expanding endovascular stent formed of stainless steel wire which is bent into an elongated zigzag pattern (5) and helically wound about a central axis (31) to define a tubular shape (30). Adjacent bends (8) in the helix are interconnected with a filament (32). The stent (30) is capable of being radially compressed such that the straight wire sections (11, 13 and 15), and the bends (8) are tightly packed around a central axis (31). The stent (30) resiliently self-expands to assume a tubular shape when released from the compressed state.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates generally to self-expanding
endovascular stents for use in preventing restenosis of
passageways and ducts in the body, to repair aneurysms
percutaneously, and also for dilating recurring stenosis
immediately after attempts with ballooning.This invention represents an improvement in the
self-expanding stents described and shown in U.S. Patent No.
4,580,568 to Gianturco. Conventional stents of this type
include a wire formed in a closed zigzag configuration that
includes an endless series of straight sections joined by
bends. A conventional zigzag stent is resiliently
compressible into a small diameter such that the straight
sections are arranged side by side and closely adjacent one
another for insertion into a passageway. The stent is
resiliently self-expandable into a larger second diameter
wherein the straight sections press against the walls of the
passageway to maintain it open. Although conventional zigzag
stents have proven quite useful in many situations, their
performance characteristics tend to decrease as the length of
the stent increases.Self-expanding stents are normally evaluated with respect
to four performance characteristics: the radially outward
expansile force that the stent exerts on the vascular wall;
the small diameter to which the stent is capable of being
compressed for the insertion procedure; the ability of the
stent to adapt to curved passageways in the patient's body;
and the stability of the stent in not migrating from its
originally implanted position within the patient.Conventional zigzag stents must normally be made 
relatively short because the straight wire sections prevent
the stent from readily adapting to curves in the passageway
of a patient. Furthermore, the expansile force of
conventional zigzag stents generally decreases with the
length of the stent. One solution to these drawbacks has
been to modify the conventional zigzag stent by connecting a
plurality of shorter stents end on end to create one longer
zigzag stent assembly. Although these modified zigzag stents
represent an improvement over conventional zigzag stents for
certain applications, there exists a need for an elongated
self-expanding stent that includes the advantages of both
conventional and modified zigzag stents but which has
improved performance characteristics over both.A self-expanding spiral stent according to the preamble of
claim 1 is
described in U.S. Patent No.

<CLAIMS>
A self-expanding stent (30,50) comprising:

a wire bent into an elongated zigzag pattern (5) having
a plurality of substantially straight wire sections (9,11,13,15)

separating a plurality of bends (8);
the zigzag pattern wire being helically wound about
a central axis to define a tubular shape such that a

majority of the plurality of bends are disposed in a
helix;
the stent (30,50) having a radially compressed state such
that the straight wire sections (9,11,13,15) and bends (8) are tightly

packed around the central axis (31), whereby the stent (30,50) self-expands
to assume the tubular shape when released from the

compressed state, the stent (30,50) being characterised by means (32)
for interconnecting adjacent bends (8) of said helix.
The self-expanding stent of claim 1 wherein the
means for interconnecting is a filament (32), the filament (32)

preventing the stent (30,50) from expanding beyond a tubular shape
of predetermined size.
The self-expanding stent of claim 2 wherein said
stent (30,50) has two ends (33,35), each said end (33,35) being defined by a

plurality of end bends (36), adjacent end bends (36) being
interconnected by a filament(34).
The self-expanding stent of claim 3 wherein each 
of the plurality of bends (8) is bent to include an eye

portion (21,23), the filament being tied to each eye portion.
The self-expanding stent of claim 4 wherein at
least two of the eye portions (21,23) are closed.
The self-expanding stent of claim 5 wherein the
wire has first and second ends (6) each formed into defining

a closed eye portion (20), the first and second ends (6) being
disposed in the helix and interconnected to two adjacent

bends (8) in the helix.
The self-expanding stent of claim 2 wherein the
wire has first and second ends (6), each being soldered to a

different one of the plurality of straight wire sections (9,11,13,15).
The self-expanding stent of claim 1 wherein the
tubular shape defines a length and a diameter that varies

along the length.
The self-expanding stent of claim 1 further
comprising a flexible sleeve open at both ends and

attached to the stent(30,50), the flexible sleeve being supported
by the stent(30,50).
The self-expanding stent of claim 1 wherein each
of the bends (8) disposed in the helix defines an angle (2α), and

a bisector (40) of each angle (2α) is substantially parallel to the
central axis (31).
