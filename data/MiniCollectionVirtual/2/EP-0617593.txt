<DESCRIPTION>
My invention relates generally to the field of dental models and, more
particularly, to a novel dowel-pin for a tooth die, and to a method of making
a dental model incorporating such a dowel-pin.The present invention is an improvement of my prior invention
described and claimed in my prior US Patent No. 4,840,565, issued June 20,
1989, and entitled, "Tooth-Die Dowel-Pin and Locking Assembly and Method
of Making a Dental Model Incorporating Said Assembly". This patent is
a useful reference for its background information.In order to fabricate a crown or inlay on a tooth, an impression of a
patient's mouth is taken, and a reproduction is made in the dental laboratory.
Since the reproduction is a solid positive model of the mouth, it is necessary
to isolate reproductions or dies of the individual teeth which have been
prepared to receive a restoration. This isolation is accomplished by various
types of dowel pins, each of which is secured to a respective die by either a
first known process wherein a dowel-pin is inserted into the impression
material before the dental model is fabricated, or a second known process
wherein the entire solid dental model is first made and, then, holes are drilled
above the individual prepared tooth areas or dies to receive individual dowel
pins which are inserted and glued into the drilled holes.In the fabrication of dental models and individual tooth dies, it is
extremely important to have both an accurate reproduction of each tooth die
and also of the relationship between each individual die and the adjacent model
teeth. Since the natural teeth that are positioned in the dental arch are
stationary, each individual die on the dental model must be accurately 
positioned with respect to the entire model so as to correspond to the natural
teeth. If there is any movement of the die in the model, then the fabrication
of a dental restoration (crown, inlay, etc.) will not be accurate, because, then,
the model will not be an accurate reproduction of the natural teeth.Furthermore, when individual crowns are to be fabricated to restore
two or more natural teeth and are to be intentionally joined (soldered) on the
model, any movement of the die or dies will cause the final restoration to be
inaccurate since the movement of the dies creates an inaccurate reproduction
of the natural teeth. Similarly, when crowns are fabricated on dies, and
removable appliances are fabricated to be inserted on or into these crowns, any
movement of the dies would produce an inaccurate restoration for

<CLAIMS>
A one-piece molded non-metallic plastic dental dowel-pin (10) in combination
with a tooth die (22) for use in a finally trimmed dental model that was made by a

two-pour process, said combination comprising a tooth die (22) made by a first pour
and having an outer periphery and an upper surface, and for use with a base model

(26) made by a second pour and having a groove (40) therein, said dowel-pin being
adapted to be fixed to said tooth die (22) and to be removably inserted in a bore in

said base model (26); said dowel-pin (10) comprising:

a fastening end-portion (14) extending in a first direction and adapted to be
fixed to said tooth die (22);
an elongated free end-portion (12) extending in a direction opposite to said first
direction and being adapted to be removably inserted in said base model (26); and
an integral elongated locking-and-indexing arm (16) portion having a first
index-segment (18) extending from a junction of said fastening and free end-portions

(14,12) in a transverse direction relative to said first and opposite directions; said arm
portion (16) matching and being adapted to be received in said groove (40) in said

base model (26) when said free end-portion (12) is inserted in said base model (26);
said first index-segment (18) having a length which is sufficiently long to
extend along said upper surface and outwardly beyond said outer periphery of said

tooth die (22) so that, after the dental model has been finally trimmed, an outer tip
(38) of said first index-segment is visible on an outer surface of said base model (26).
A one-piece molded dental dowel-pin as defined in claim 1, wherein said arm
portion (16) has a second index-segment (15) which extends in a direction opposite

to that in which said first index-segment (18) extends and which, after the dental
model (26) has been finally trimmed, is buried inside the base model (26) and is

invisible on the outer surface of the base model (26).
A one-piece molded dental dowel-pin as defined in claims 1 or 2, wherein said

second index-segment (19) has a length which is shorter than that of said first index-segment
(18). 
A one-piece molded dental dowel-pin as defined in claims 1 or 2, wherein said
second index-segment (19) has a length which is the same as that of said first index-segment

(18).
A one-piece molded dental dowel-pin as defind in claim 1, wherein said
elongated free end-portion (12a) has at least one longitudinally extending integral rib

(42) which has a transverse width and a longitudinal length, and which projects
substantially transversely outwardly from a longitudinal surface of said elongated free

end-portion (12a).
A one-piece molded dental dowel-pin as defined in claim 5, wherein there are
two longitudinally extending integral ribs (52,54) spaced apart by approximately 180°

about a circumference of said elongated free end-portion (56) and in alignment with
said first and second index-segments (61,62) respectively.
A one-piece molded dental dowel-pin as defined in claims 5 or 6, wherein said
length of said first index-segment (61) varies inversely with one of (1) said transverse

width and (2) said longitudinal length in order to prevent rotation of said tooth die
when inserted in said base model.
A one-piece molded dental dowel-pin as defined in claim 6, wherein outer
surfaces of said first index-segment (61), said second index-segment (62), said integral

ribs (42) and said elongated free end-portion (12a) are tapered to enable easy removal
of the dowel-pin (50) from the base model (64) after the second pour and from the

finally trimmed model, and to provide a run-off path for accumulated debris rinsed
from between said tooth-die and the base model when the tooth die is removed from,

and reinserted in, the base model.
A one-piece molded dental dowel-pin as defined in claims 5 or 6, wherein said
longitudinal length of each integral rib (42) extends from said junction (59) toward,

and terminates short of, an outer free tip of said elongated free end-portion (56);

   wherein said longitudinal length of each integral rib (42) is approximately 2/3 
the length of said elongated free end-portion (56); and

   wherein said locking-and-indexing arm portion (57) has at said junction a
thickness extending in the direction of the length of said elongated free end-portion

(56), the sum of said thickness plus said longitudinal length of each integral rib being
approximately 4/5 the length of said elongated free end-portion (56).
A two-pour process for making a dental model and using a one-piece molded
dental dowel-pin (10) having a fastening end-portion (14) which extends in a first

direction and which is adapted to be fixed to a tooth die (22) made by a first pour,
a free end-portion (12) extending in a direction opposite to said first direction and

adapted to be removably inserted in a base model (26) made by a second pour, and
an integral elongated locking-and-indexing arm (16) extending from a junction of said

fastening and free end-portions (12,14) in a direction transverse to said first and
opposite directions and being adapted to be received in a corresponding groove (40)

in the base model (26) when the free end-portion (18) is inserted in the dental model
(26), the elongated arm (16) having a length which is sufficiently long so that, after

the dental model has been finally trimmed, an outer tip (38) of the elongated arm (16)
is visible on an outer surface of the base model; said process comprising the steps of:


fixing the fastening-end portion (14) of the dowel-pin (10) in a bore hole of
the tooth die (22) so that the free end-portion (12) and the integral elongated arm (16)

of the dowel-pin (10) are exposed on a base surface of the tooth die (22), and so that
the elongated arm (16) extends beyond the periphery of the base surface;
pouring a dental stone-mix over the assembled dowel-pin and tooth die;
allowing the stone-mix to dry and harden to form a rough dental model; and
trimming the rough dental model, in at least a portion thereof in which the
elongated arm (16) is embedded, to form a trimmed outer surface at which an outer

tip (38) of the elongated arm (16) is visible and is flush with said outer surface of the
base model (26).
