<ABSTRACT>
A multi-layer polyimide film having excellent 
adhesion between the layers without using an adhesive, 

prepared by coextruding a layer of a first poly(amic 
acid) derived from the reaction of an aromatic 

tetracarboxylic dianhydride and an aromatic diamine and 
at least one layer of a second poly(amic acid) derived 

from the reaction of 4,4'-oxydiphthalic dianhydride and 
a (diaminophenoxy)benzene to form a self-supporting 

multi-layer poly(amic acid) film and heat-treating the 
multi-layer film to completely convert the poly(amic 

acid) layers to the multi-layer polyimide film. 
Optionally, the poly(amic acid) solutions may contain 

fine particles of an inorganic filler to enhance 
properties of the multi-layer film. The coextruded 

multi-layer polyimide film is used in the formation of 
single and double polyimide metal-clad lamin
ates for 
use in flexible circuit applications.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a multi-layer 
aromatic polyimide film prepared by coextruding at 
least two aromatic poly(amic acid) solutions to form a 
multi-layer aromatic polyimide film having two or more 
layers and which does not contain an adhesive or tie 
layer. Particularly preferred are coextruded multi-layer 
polyimide films comprising a polyimide film base 
layer and at least one heat-sealable layer of a 
polyimide derived from 4,4'-oxydiphthalic dianhydride 
and a (diaminophenoxy)benzene. Aromatic polyimides generally exhibit outstanding 
heat resistance in comparison with other organic 
polymers and, additionally, have excellent mechanical 
properties, chemical resistance and electrical 
insulating properties. However, due to the 
intractability of such polyimides and because of the 
high temperature limitations of commercially available 
adhesives, attempts to prepare multi-layer polyimide 
films by directly bonding one polyimide film surface to 
another polyimide film surface have not been entirely 
satisfactory. For example, commercially available non-polyimide 
adhesives lack sufficient thermal stability, 
radiation resistance, or flexibility, for most end uses 
of the polyimide. Multi-layered polyimide films can also be prepared by 
coating a base gel film structure of a poly(amic acid), or 
other polyimide precursor, with a poly(amic acid) solution 
and thereafter heat-treating the coated base film to 
completely convert the entire structure to a polyimide 
polymeric material. However, in many cases, the poly(amic  
 
acid) coating exhibits inferior adhesion to the polyimide 
base film. European Patent Application 0 474 054, published on 
March 11, 1992, discloses a multi-layer polyimide film 
comprising an aromatic polyimide film base layer and at 
least one layer of a heat-sealable polyimide adhesive 
containing at least 30 mole % of repeating imide units 
derived from 4,4'-oxydiphthalic dianhydride and a 
(diaminophenoxy)benzene. The multi-layer polyimide is 
prepared by coating a solution of the poly(amic acid) 
adhesive directly on a fully cured polyimide base film, or 
on a partially cured poly(amic acid) gel or green film and 
then curing to form the polyimide. U.S. 3,505,168, issued to Dunphy et al on April 7, 
1970, discloses a heat-sealable polyimide laminar structure 
having at least two layers wherein the polyimide of one 
layer is different from the polyimide of the other layer, 
prepared by coating a base polyimide layer with a layer of 
a poly(amic acid) precursor
