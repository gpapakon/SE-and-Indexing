<ABSTRACT>
A holder (24) is disclosed for positioning at least one sheetlike 
image (23) wherein said holder (24) comprises several layers 

assembled one to the other by adhesive joints and wherein at least 
the uppermost of said layers has at least one slot (46) for 

introducing said image (23) and at least one opening (48) for 
exposing (21) said image (23) and wherein said image (23) is 

flattened in order to avoid Newtonian rings.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a holder for a two-dimensional 
image that is being exposed in a scanning device for 
digital data processing. Common image holders as known in the art tend to be of rather 
complicated construction and are often unwieldy in use. It is known 
to press the image between two glass plates that have been subjected 
to a special treatment to prevent annoying reflections and/or 
Newtonian rings; in addition, such glass plates are usually spring-loaded 
and frequently equipped with hinge and/or pressure means. Whereas US 2,799,107 describes a file card structure for 
transparent strips and/or individual frames of exposed photographic 
film, and whereas US 4,357,073 describes a filmstrip holder for a 
collapsible stereoscopic viewer, the holder of the present invention 
is not restricted to transparent images but clearly also may be 
applied to reflective images; secondly, according to the present 
invention, the images are flattened in order to avoid Newtonian 
rings. It is an object of the invention to provide a suitable image 
holder that can be bought at a reasonable price and is yet 
convenient and reliable in practical use. Other objects and advantages will become apparent from the 
description hereinbelow referring to the enclosed drawings.  We now have found that the abovementioned objects can be 
achieved by providing a flat holder for positioning at least one 
sheetlike image in relation to an exposure light source wherein said 
holder comprises several layers assembled one to the other by 
adhesive joints and wherein at least the layer located nearest to 
the exposure light source has at least one opening for exposing said 
image and at least one feed slot for introducing said image, and 
wherein said sheetlike image is flattened in order to avoid 
Newtonian rings. The present invention will be described in detail hereinbelow 
by way of example with reference to the enclosed figures 1 to 7, 
wherein 
Fig. 1is a general representation of a scanning and digitizing 
device; Fig. 2is a schematic diagram of the actual scanner of the 
device of fig. 1; Fig. 3is a representation of the exposure area; Fig. 4is a cross-sectional view of an image holder according to 
the present invention; Fig. 5is a cross-sectional view of an alternative embodiment of 
the inventive image holder; Fig. 6is a top view of a holder according to the present 
invention; 
The expression "holder" means in the present context 
image holder, transparency holder, negative holder and 
original holder.

<CLAIMS>
A flat holder (24) for positioning at least one sheetlike 
image (23) in relation to an exposure light source (21) wherein said 

holder (24) comprises several layers (41, 42, 43, 44, 45) assembled 
one to the other by adhesive joints (49) and wherein at least the 

layer (45) located nearest to the exposure light source (21) has at 
least one opening (47) for exposing said image (23) and at least one 

feed slot (61) for introducing said image (23), and wherein said 
image (23) is flattened in order to avoid Newtonian rings. 
A holder (24) according to claim 1, wherein said sheetlike 
image (23) is provided on a photographic material. 
A holder (24) according to claim 1 or 2, wherein said 
sheetlike image (23) is provided on a transparent material. 
A holder (24) according to any of the preceding claims, 
wherein said sheetlike image (23) is provided on a rectangular film 

strip (23) comprising several separate images (23). 
A holder (24) according to any of the preceding claims, 
wherein said layers comprise a basic sheet material with an 

adhesive (41), a glass plate (42), a resilient medium (43), an 
intermediate sheet material with adhesive (44) and an upper sheet 

material with adhesive (45). 
A holder (24) according to claim 5, wherein said resilient 
medium (3) is made of expanded rubber (43). 
A holder (24) according to claim 5, wherein said upper sheet 
material (45) comprises a slide-in tab (61) preventing the film 

strip (23) from getting gripped upon sliding-in. 
A holder (24) according to claim 5, wherein said upper sheet 
material (45) comprises a slide-out curvature (71) preventing the 

film Strip (23) from getting gripped upon sliding-out. 
A holder (24) according to claim 5 or 7, wherein said upper 
sheet material (45) comprises slide-in tab (61) and an identical 

 
slide-out tab (71) preventing the film strip (23) from getting 

gripped and enabling both left-hand and right-hand displacements. 
A holder (24) according to claim 5, wherein said upper sheet 
material (45) comprises a viewing opening (47) accessible to light 

that is substantially narrower than the slot width (46) required for 
positioning the film (23)

strip (23) is being held and unrequired images (23) are covered up 

during gang scanning before exposure. 
A holder (24) according to any of the preceding claims that 
comprises a calibration hole (63) for electronically calibrating the 

device that is exposing said sheetlike image (23). 
A holder (24) according to any of the preceding claims that 

comprises a lever (64).
