<ABSTRACT>
A cutting machine for railroad rails wherein clamping is 
performed by a screw to fasten a locating frame (3) onto a gauge (9) 

which indicates a cutting position and is fastened onto a railroad 
rail (5); the locating frame (3) being connected to a main body block 

(1) via slide shafts (2); and a rotating grinding disk saw (30) 
driven by an engine (18) mounted on the main body block (1) is rocked 

by working a stroke handle (11) to move the rotating grinding disk 
saw (30) smoothly along the cutting line to cut the railroad rail (5) 

crosswise. By varying the cut of the rotating grinding disk saw 
(30), frictional resistance to cutting is reduced and the generation 

of frictional heat is prevented, permitting use of a small-scale 
engine and improving the accuracy of the cut.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to railroad rail cutting
apparatus, and particularly concerns apparatus for in situ cutting of
railroad rails to specified lengths during laying or joining of railroad
rails.Cutting machines having flat, rotary grinding disk saws that are
driven by a power source to cut rails to specified lengths are employed
during the laying of railroad rails and the replacement of worn rails.Conventional cutting machines are of a configuration whereby the
main body is clamped to the railroad rail and the grinding disk saw is
advanced in a specified single direction while the grinding disk saw is
rotated. Because of this single direction of advance of the blade, the
entire width of the head of the rail is cut crosswise without changing the
contact position of the grinding disk saw with respect to the railroad
rail.In such a cutting method, since the grinding disk saw
continuously rotates keeping the same cutting line as given at first
contact, not only is a large amount of frictional heat generated and
consequently the rail is hardened in the region of the cut, but also a
large engine is required to drive the rotary grinding disk saw due to this
large friction. Then, vibration is readily transmitted to the rotary
grinding disk saw and substantial cutting pressure is needed, which causes
widened and deflected cuts, impeding high-precision cutting.There is known from US-A-4 033 074 a hand carried portable rail
saw assembly which includes a saw having a rotatable blade, a clamp
adapted to attach to a rail to be cut and an axial locater adjustably
mounted on the clamp and supporting the saw. The saw is pivotable
attached to the axial locater and is arranged for pivotal movement from
one side of the rail to the other so that first one side of the rail is
cut and then the opposite side is cut.The object of the present invention is to provide a
high-performance rail cutting machine wherein high-precision cutting is
performed with a narrow cut to prevent hardening of the rail, a small, 
light power source is used for easy handling, and the positioning of the
cutting machine is easily made.According to the present invention there is provided a cutting
apparatus for a railroad rail, comprising a clamping device having a
locating frame engageable with one lateral face of the rail and a clamp
arm acting on the other face of the rail to urge the locating frame into
contact therewith, a cutting saw having a circular cutting blade, the saw
being mounted on a pivoting arm for swinging movement in a
