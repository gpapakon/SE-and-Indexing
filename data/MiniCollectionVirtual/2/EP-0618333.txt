<ABSTRACT>
Adaptor for fixing a grab bucket to the end of the arm (1) of a shovel including a fastening member (3) articulated to the end of the said arm via a shaft (4), characterised in that the adaptor (5) is in the form of two associated clevises (5a and 5b), the lower clevis (5b) being articulated on the vertical shaft (2) of the grab bucket, while the upper one (5b) via its cheeks forms two hooks (7) opening downwards, onto which lateral extensions (4a) of the shaft (4) for articulation of the member for fastening onto the arm (1) are hooked.   The axis of the shaft (4) and that of the shaft (6) for articulation on the grab bucket are offset by 90@. Means are provided for locking the extensions (4a) into the hooks (7).
