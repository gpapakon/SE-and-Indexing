<ABSTRACT>
Disclosed are injectable suspensions of gas filled microbubbles in an aqueous carrier liquid usable as contrast agents in ultrasonic echography. The suspensions comprise amphipathic compounds of which at least one may be a laminarized phospholipid as a stabiliser of the microbubbles against collapse with time and pressure. The concentration of phospholipids in the carrier liquid is below 0.01 % wt but is at least equal to or above that at which phospholipid molecules are present solely at the gas microbubble-liquid interface. Also disclosed is a method of preparation of the stable suspensions of air or gas filled microbubbles.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to injectable suspensions of gas filled 
microbubbles in an aqueous carrier comprising amphipathic 
compounds of which at least one is a phospholipid stabilizer of the 
microbubbles against collapse with time and pressure. The 
phospholipid stabilizer may be in a lamellar or laminar form. The 
invention also comprises a method of making stable suspensions of 
microbubbles usable as contrast agents in ultrasonic echography. Use of suspensions of gas microbubbles in a carrier liquid as 
efficient ultrasound reflectors is well known in the art. The 
development of microbubble suspensions as echopharmaceuticals for 
enhancement of ultrasound imaging followed early observations that 
rapid intravenous injections can cause solubilized gases to come out of 
solution forming bubbles. Due to their substantial difference in 
acoustic impedance relative to blood, these intravascular gas bubbles 
are found to be excellent reflectors of ultrasound. Injecting into the 
blood-stream of living organisms suspensions of gas microbubbles in a 
carrier liquid strongly reinforces ultrasonic echography imaging, thus 
enhancing the visualisation of internal organs. Since imaging of organs 
and deep seated tissue can be crucial in establishing medical diagnosis 
a lot of effort is devoted to the development of stable suspensions of 
highly concentrated gas microbubbles which at the same time would 
be simple to prepare and administer, would contain a minimum of 
inactive species, would be capable of long storage and simple 
distribution. Many attempts towards a solution which will satisfy these  
 
distribution. Many attempts towards a solution which will satisfy these 
criteria have been made, however, none have provided a completely 
satisfactory result. It has been known from EP-A-0 077 752 (Schering that 
suspensions of gas microbubbles can be made by mixing an aqueous 
solution of a surfactant with a solution of a viscosity enhancer as a 
stabilizer. The gas bubbles are introduced into the mixture by forcing 
the mixture of reagents and air through a small aperture. A suspension 
of CO2 microbubbles may be obtained by addition of an acid to a mixture 
obtained from a solution containing a surfactant and sodium bicarbonate 
and a solution of the viscosity enhancer. Mixing the components 
however, is to be carried out just before use and the solution is to be 
consumed/injected immediately upon preparation. The disclosed 
surfactants (tensides) comprise lecithins; esters and ethers of fatty 
acids and
