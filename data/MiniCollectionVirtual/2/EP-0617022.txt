<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to 6, 7 - dialkoxy - 3, 4-dihydroisoquinolin
- 8 - ols useful as intermediate raw materials for
synthesis of isoquinolines having a hydroxyl group or a lower
alkoxy group at the 8-position of the isoquinoline skeleton, useful
as an antitumor effect potentiator for anticancer agent in the
pharmaceutical field (see, PCT/JP89/00825, WO 90/02119), a
process for preparation thereof and a process for preparation of 6,
7 - dialkoxy - 1, 2, 3, 4 - tetrahydroisoquinolin - 8 - ols (e.g.,d1-corpaverine,
anhalamine. etc.) using the compounds.As an example of processes for preparation of 6, 7-dialkoxy
-1, 2, 3, 4-tetrahydroisoquinolin-8-ols, a synthetic process by the
Bischler-Napieralski reaction is known. In the case of synthesizing,
for example, dl - corpaverine using this synthetic process, there is
reported a route, as shown in the following Reaction formula A, to
obtain such a desired product by subjecting a 3, 4-dihydroisoquinoline
obtained as a mixture of regioisomers after
cyclization reaction to several steps including separation of the
isomers (Chem Pharm. Bull., 15, 879, 1967). Further as an example of regioselective synthesis, a route
using the Pomeranz-Fritsch reaction as shown in the following
Reaction formula B is known (J. Chem. Soc., (C), 715, 1966). Further , as a process for preparation of a
tetrahydroisoquinolin-8-ol having a substituent at the 1-position,
a route using the Grignard reaction with 2-methyl-3,4-dihydroisoquinolium
bromide as a raw material, as shown in
Reaction formula C, is reported (Helv. Chim. Acta, 49, 1757, 1966).
Further, as an example wherein the Bischler-Napieralski
reaction was carried out using a phenethylamide derivative having
a phenolic hydroxyl group at the 3-position as a raw material to 
progress a selective cyclization at the ortho position of the phenolic
hydroxyl group, it has hitherto been reported that the
cyclization was controlled in one direction by introducing a
bromine atom at the para position of the phenolic hydroxyl group
as a group which blocks participation in the cyclization, as shown in
Reaction formula D (J. Chem Soc. (C), 1796, 1971).
Further, in J. Am. Chem Soc., 92 (No.23), 6943-6951 (1970),
the following in vitro reactions are carried out using *CH3COCO2H
(*C=14C) in order to verify a biosynthetic mechanism.
Further in the above literature, an authentic compound for
identification of the final product of the above step is synthesized
according to the following Reaction formula E.
