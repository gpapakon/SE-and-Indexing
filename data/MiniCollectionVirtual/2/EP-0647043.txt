<ABSTRACT>
In transmitting information over a cellular communications channel 
(200) to an opposite endpoint (300, 30), a modem's (100) autorating routine is 

"data-driven." In particular, when the amount of information to transmit to the 
opposite endpoint is low, the modem's data rate is low, e.g., 4800 bps, and the 

modem's ability to autorate upwards, i.e., fallforward, is disabled. However, when 
the amount of information to transmit to the opposite endpoint is high, the modem's 

ability to fallforward is enabled so that the modem's data rate can increase to the 
highest permissible data rate for the cellular channel in order to transmit large blocks 

of information.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to data communications and, more 
particularly, to mobile data communications. A mobile data communications channel is sometimes referred to as an 
"impaired channel" since it is affected by a number of channel impairments like 
Rayleigh fading, co-channel interference, etc., that increase the error rate and, thus, 
degrade the overall performance of the mobile data connection. One form of 
mitigating the affects of an impaired channel is to simply apply land-line modem 
standards to the mobile radio environment. In the land-line modem arena, International Telephone and Telegraph 
Consultative Committee (CCITT) standard V.32bis is a representative modulation 
standard. In V.32bis, during the "start-up mode," or "connection phase," both 
modems, or endpoints, establish the data connection, e.g., perform a "handshaking" 
sequence to establish the modulation standard, error control, and the data rate. After 
the start-up mode, the "data mode," or "communications phase" is entered in which 
data, or information, is exchanged between the two modems over the mobile data 
communication channel. One of the features of V.32bis is the ability to sequentially, 
and automatically, "autorate" upwards or downwards between 4800 bits per second 
(bps) and 14400 bps during either the start-up mode or the data mode as a function 
of the error characteristics of the communications channel. For example, if a land-line 
data connection is initially established between two modems at 14400 bps and 
the error rate subsequently increases beyond a predetermined threshold, one of the 
modems will negotiate a data rate change down to the next lowest data rate. In this 
example, the data rate would change from 14400 bps to 9600 bps. At the latter data 
rate, information is then transmitted for a period of time to monitor the resulting 
error rate. If the error rate is still above a predetermined threshold, one of the 
modems will, again, negotiate a data rate change down to 4800 bps. On the other 
hand, if the error rate decreases for a period of time while transmitting data at 9600 
bps, one of the modems will negotiate a data rate change to the next highest data 
rate, i.e., from 9600 bps to 14400 bps. In either event, this "error-based" autorate 
feature takes advantage of the fact that the error rate of a communications channel is 
typically also a function of the data rate, i.e., the higher the data rate, the likelihood 
of an error increases.  Thus, in the context of a mobile data communications

An autorating method for use in a modem, the method comprising the 
steps of: 

   receiving data from a data terminal equipment for transmission to a far-end 
modem; 

   performing error-based autorating when the modem is in a file transfer 
mode; 

   performing data-driven autorating when the modem is in an interactive 
mode; and 

   transmitting the received data to the far-end modem; 
   where the modem switches between the file transfer mode and the 

interactive mode as a function of the amount of received data in a time interval. 
The method of claim 1 wherein during the interactive mode the step of 
transmitting sends the received data at a data rate that is no greater than a first value, 

and during the file transfer mode sends the received data at a data rate that is no 
greater than a second value, where the second value is greater than the first value. 
The method of claim 2 wherein the error-based autorating step varies 
the data rate as a function of the number of errors in a received data signal from the 

far-end modem, where the data rate varies between 1200 bps and the second value. 
The method of claim 2 wherein the error-based autorating step 
includes the steps of: 

   receiving a data signal from a far-end modem at a data rate of at least 
4800 bits per second; 

   counting the errors in the received data signal to provide an accumulated 
number of errors; 

   comparing the accumulated number of errors to a predetermined 
threshold at the expiration of a time interval; and 

   changing the data rate from the at least 4800 bits per second to a higher 
value if the number of detected errors is less than a predetermined threshold.

when the modem is in a file transfer mode, and performs data-driven autorating when 

the modem is in an interactive mode (110, 120);

count of detected errors is below the predetermined threshold.
