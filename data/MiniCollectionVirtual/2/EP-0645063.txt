<ABSTRACT>
A receiver automatic gain control (AGC) circuit includes a first adjustable gain control amplifier (158) which is responsive to a gain control signal (156). The AGC circuit further includes a second adjustable gain control amplifier (114) and a control circuit (116) which receives the gain control signal (156) and provides a modified gain control signal or VCNTRL (152) to the second adjustable control amplifier (114). The control circuit (116) also limits the amount of gain control applied to adjustable gain control amplifiers (114 and 118) when the gain control signal (156) reaches a certain predetermined level. This provides for all further gain reduction to occur at the first adjustable gain control amplifier (158) and thereby reduce the chances for distortion under high input signal conditions.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates generally to radio communication receivers,
and more specifically to a radio communication receiver automatic gain
control (AGC) system.In radio frequency (RF) receivers containing integrated active filter stages
such as zero intermediate frequency receivers (ZIF receiver), automatic
gain control (AGC) circuit is typically employed. The function of the AGC
circuit is to control the signal level to the active filter stages in the receiver
so the signal is not driven in to limit (clipping) conditions. Automatic gain
control circuits attempt to keep the output level of the receiver constant
regardless of received input signal strength. Typically, the receiver gain is
regulated in inverse proportion to the signal strength of the received signal.In order to protect from signal over-drive conditions in a multi-stage
active filter arrangement such as found in a ZIF receiver, the stage under
gain control is usually selected as one of the first stages in the receiver
path. This less than optimum implementation of an AGC system results in a
decrease in the maximum signal-to-noise ratio whenever large input signals
are present at the receiver's front-end. This decrease in signal to noise
ratio is caused by the fact that the noise floor does not decrease as much
as the signal level when AGC is applied. In other words, the decrease in
signal to noise ratio is caused by a reduction in system takeover by the
AGC circuit.In other prior art AGC systems gain reduction has been applied to
multiple amplifier stages simultaneously in order to control multiple stages
of a receiver to avoid signal distortion. A good example of such a system
can be found in United States Patent 4,850,038 entitled "Frequency
converter" by Shibata et al. Unfortunately, under strong input signal
conditions such as when a pair of transceivers are communicating with
each other at a close distance, even prior art systems that rely on multiple
AGC controlled stages have problems with signal distortion due to signal
clipping. A need thus exists for a communication receiver AGC system
which can provide for improved maximum signal to noise ratios even under
large received input signal conditions.Published United States Patent US-A-4403346 describes an
automatic gain control arrangement. Figs 7, 8 and 9 and column 8, lines 6-14, 
of US-A-4403346 show an AGC circuit responsive to a weak signal and
a control source (50) for governing the first and second AGC circuits to
perform a delayed operation. The delayed AGC system including
