<ABSTRACT>
An object detecting device for detecting an object at least 
partly having a magnetic substance or magnetic-flux permeable 

material, constituted by: a detection coil arrangement including 
a primary coil (13) for generating magnetic flux and a secondary 

coil (15) disposed separately from the primary coil at a 
predetermined interval for receiving the magnetic flux from the 

primary coil; and a detection circuit for detecting an increase 
of the magnetic flux transmitted to the secondary coil due to 

presence of the object within a space between the primary and 
secondary coils and for producing a signal indicating the 

presence of the object upon detection of the presence.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention generally relates to an object
detecting device for detecting the fact that an object is
positioned in a predetermined area, and particularly relates to
an object detecting device arranged in such a manner that a
magnetic-flux generating source and a detector portion are
disposed separately from each other in a predetermined area so
that when an object at least partly having a magnetic substance
or magnetic-flux permeable material such as iron is positioned
above the area, the magnetic flux is transmitted to the detector
portion through the magnetic substance or magnetic-flux permeable
material such as iron of the object so that the presence of the
object is detected on the basis of a change in the detected
magnetic flux.In order to make a plurality of objects, for example,
vehicles such as cars, motor bicycles, and so on, each of which
contains a magnetic substance or magnetic-flux permeable material
such as iron, park in a parking zone, vehicle detecting devices
are provided respectively in parking sections of the parking zone
so as to detect presence of parked vehicles. Such a vehicle
detecting device is realized by using light rays, an ultrasonic
wave, or a microwave, or by using a buried loop coil. More
specifically, a pole provided with a light emitting device or an
oscillator for generating an ultrasonic wave or a microwave is
planted in the vicinity of an inlet of each of the parking
sections. Alternatively, a light emitting device or an
oscillator for generating an ultrasonic wave or a microwave is 
provided on the ceiling of the parking zone so as to emit light
rays, an ultrasonic wave, or a microwave toward each of the
parking sections. Existence of a vehicle is detected by
detecting shielding of light rays due to presence of the vehicle
in the case of using the light rays, or by catching a reflection
wave which changes by presence of the vehicle in the case of
using an ultrasonic wave or a microwave. Alternatively, a loop
coil is buried in the ground in each of the parking sections so
that presence of a vehicle is detected by detecting a change in
inductance of the loop coil caused by presence of the vehicle in
the section.However, the light rays from the light emitting device or an
ultrasonic wave or a microwave from the oscillator spreads in
proportion to the distance from the light emitting device or from
the oscillator to a vehicle in a target section so that there is
a possibility that not only the vehicle in the target section but
any other vehicles in other
