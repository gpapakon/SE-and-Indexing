<ABSTRACT>
A decision feedback equalizer is suitable for use with a bipolar return-to-zero receiver. The equalizer determines an output Y(n) (160) based on a compensated received value X(n) (104) and a correction factor, D(n) (141). After receiving X(n), the equalizer then forms an equalized received value X'(n) (107) based on combining X(n) with D(n). The equalizer then determines the output value Y(n) based on comparing X'(n) with a positive threshold, V1 and a negative threshold, V2. When Y(n) is determined to be zero, the equalizer adjusts the stored correction value D(n) by a predetermined value,  DELTA , based on whether X'(n) is positive or negative.

<DESCRIPTION>
This application relates to equalizers including, but not limited to, a
decision feedback equalizer apparatus, and to receivers
comprising such equalizers.Equalizer design has long been one of the most important
considerations in the design of receivers suited for providing modem
digital land-line-based data services such as, for example, DDS and T1.
Both of these services use bipolar return-to-zero ("BRZ") signals for
transmission. As is known, in a BRZ transmission system a "1" logical
value is transmitted as either a positive or negative pulse while a "0"
logical value is denoted by the absence of a pulse. Successive pulses
alternate in polarity, giving rise to the term "alternate mark inversion," or
"AMI." Certain conditions cause this rule to be violated but, under this
rule, it is never legal to transmit two consecutive positive or negative
pulses.Conventional equalizers for BRZ signals operate by selecting an
appropriate inverse line model for the given communication channel. If 
the line model is correct, the attenuation and phase
distortion introduced by the line can be effectively
compensated for in the received signal. A noise limiting
filter is sometimes added as well to eliminate out-of-band
noise."Adaptive Filters" by C.F.N. Cowan et al. (1985
Prentice-Hall Inc, Englewood Cliffs, NJ, USA pages 244-249)
discloses a decision feedback equalizer with a look-up
of a cancellation signal from a RAM, to provide echo
cancellation. EP-A 0532353 (NEC) discloses a decision-feedback
equalizer using controllable tap gains whereby a
judging circuit is used to compare filtered output
signals with a threshold level to equalize a received
signal.The problem with these conventional equalizer
structures is that their performance is limited by the
accuracy of the line models. Impairments such as bridge
taps and wire size transitions sometimes cause a line to
have characteristics that are not predicted well by
normal wire line models. One solution to this problem
would be to generate line models that take into account
every known line impairment combination. It is easy to
see that this approach becomes impractical quickly as
more and more impairment sources are considered. A
better approach is to build a receiver structure that is
capable of learning the line impairments and compensating
for them.FIG. 1 is a block diagram that shows a receiver

equalizer apparatus in accordance with the present
invention.FIG. 2 is a flow diagram for FIG. 1.FIG. 3 is a block
