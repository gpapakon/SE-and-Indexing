<ABSTRACT>
In an exchange for telecommunication systems, provided with a network suitable for the switching of voice and/or data signals as well as RNIS narrowband signals, certain means are included enabling it to handle also B-RNIS type traffic. These elements include a Central ATM Fabric (CAF) for the switching of broadband signals and at least one broadband module (MBB) accepting lines on which transit: ATM cell flows; isochronous or SDH flows; mixed flows containing SDH flows as well as ATM cell flows. As an advantage the said elements include also an interworking unit (IWU) being able to convert cells in isochronous traffic of 2 Mbit/s (and vice versa) allowing in this way the "broadband" subscribers to have access to the narrowband units in the exchange (and vice versa).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention concerns digital telecommunication 
networks, and in particular an exchange, which can be local 
or transit, for telecommunication systems including 
Broadband (or high bit rate) Integrated Service Digital 
Network, briefly indicated as B-ISDN. The invention regards more in particular an exchange 
provided with a Central ATM Fabric suitable to switch voice 
signals (and/or data) as well as narrowband ISDN signals, 
and according to the invention it includes means able to 
handle B-ISDN traffic, celled traffic, synchronous or SDH 
(Synchronous Data Hierarchy) traffic and/or mixed traffic. 
In order to overcome certain restrictions of the current 
digital telecommunication networks providing plesiochronous 
type data transmission, there has recently been a proposal 
for a digital synchronous (SDH) transmission technique. As shown in figure 4, the SDH technique provides a frame 
structure of the module or basic level STM-1 shaped by a 
matrix of 9 rows and 270 columns which elements consist of 
bytes, each of it set up by 8 bits, which expands row by 
row, from left to right and from top to bottom. The frame 
has a duration of 125 µs and so the gross transmission 
capacity of the basic module is 155.520 Mbit/s. The first nine columns of the frame (SDH) are dedicated to 
the overhead functions, as for example the alignment of the 
frame, the monitoring of the error and the auxiliary data 
channels. The remaining 261 columns make up the payload. In 
the multiplexing SDH each of the tributaries 
(plesiochronous and synchronous) are processed before 
entering the payload of the STM-1 module in such a way to 
form virtual containers (VC) setting up the synchronous 
signal (in frequency) with the aggregate STM-1 flow. The  
 
different virtual containers as a whole form the so called 
VC-4. When introducing broadband services it will be necessary to 
integrate the subscriber's access in the narrowband 
services as well as in the broadband ones. However, as the 
narrowband subscribers will be in the majority for a 
considerable time, it will be necessary to maintain and 
even to extend the narrowband services, and the same 
considerations are valid for the trunk lines. As a consequence the evolution in the direction of 
broadband will occur through the progressive fusion of 
elements of the existing network with elements of the final 
broadband network, for example by adding broadband modules 
to N-ISDN exchanges (narrowband). Until now only exchanges having N-ISDN switching matrixes 
and
