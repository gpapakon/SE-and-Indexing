<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a device for releasably connecting a guiding rod (32, 32', 32'') or the like for the parallel guidance of two locating fixtures (24, 28) for at least one camera, counterweights, etc., which are arranged at the end and in an articulated manner on a two-armed cantilever (16) pivotably accommodated by a supporting column (14), to a further guiding rod (32, 32', 32'') or the like or one of the two locating fixtures (24, 28). The device is formed from a connection sleeve (35) or the like and a connection element (38) or the like, in which case the connection sleeve (36) accommodating the connection element (38) contains a locking element (42) or the like displaceable essentially perpendicularly to the longitudinal extent of the connection sleeve (36) and spring-loaded in the direction of a locating space (40) locating the connection element (38), the connection element (38) has a recess (46) or the like, and the locking element (42) of the connection sleeve (36) and the recess (46) of the connection element (38) can be brought into positive-locking engagement with one another.
