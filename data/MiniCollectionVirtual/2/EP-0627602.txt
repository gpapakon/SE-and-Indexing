<ABSTRACT>
Method for operating a "compound" refrigerating plant which alternately runs through cooling and defrosting phases, comprising a refrigerant circuit (cycle), a compressor, a condenser, a throttling (expansion) valve and an evaporator via which the cooling of the cooling agent (nonfreezing solution, secondary fluid) circulating in a cooling agent circuit is performed. After the cooling agent is cooled it is fed to one or more air (unit) (coolers) (air cooling batteries) arranged in parallel and subsequently fed again to the evaporator by means of a pump. At least a portion of the cooling agent is heated during the cooling phase in indirect heat exchange or, by means of a further cooling agent circuit arranged between the refrigerant and cooling agent circuits, by the refrigerant, which is superheated during the cooling phase in the compressor. After termination of the cooling phase, the cooling agent heated in this way circulates for the purpose of defrosting the air coolers in the cooling agent circuit.

Method for operating a refrigerating plant which
runs alternately through cooling and defrosting phases,

with a refrigerant circuit which contains a compressor,
a condenser, an expansion valve and an evaporator and via

which the cold transfer medium circulating in a cold
transfer medium circuit is cooled, the said cold transfer

medium, after cooling, being supplied to one or more air
coolers arranged in parallel and subsequently, by means

of a pump, to the evaporator again, characterized in
that, during the cooling phase, at least part of the cold

transfer medium is heated by the refrigerant, overheated
in the compressor during the cooling phase, by indirect

heat exchange or by means of a further cold transfer
medium circuit arranged between the refrigerant circuit

and the cold transfer medium circuit, and, after the
cooling phase has ended, the cold transfer medium thus

heated circulates in the cold transfer medium circuit for
the purpose of defrosting the air coolers.
Method for operating a refrigerating plant
according to Claim 1, the refrigerating plant consisting

of a combination of two refrigerating plants, in particular
a normal-cooling and a deep-freezing refrigerating

plant, characterized in that at least part of the cold
transfer medium of one of the cold transfer medium

circuits (B) is heated by the refrigerant of that
refrigerant circuit (A') which serves for cooling the

cold transfer medium of the other cold transfer medium
circuit (B'), and at least part of the cold transfer

medium of the other cold transfer medium circuit (B') is 
heated by the refrigerant of that refrigerant circuit (A)

which serves for cooling the cold transfer medium of the
other cold transfer medium circuit (B).
Method for operating a refrigerating plant

in the refrigerant circuits (A, A') are heated
and/or condensed by indirect heat exchange (1, 1') with

the cold transfer medium of the further cold transfer

heated, of the further cold transfer medium circuit (C)

medium circuit (B) has at least two cold transfer medium
reservoirs (5, 5'), each of the cold transfer medium

reservoirs (5, 5') is connected via valves (10, 11, 12,
13) to the cold transfer medium circuit (B) and one of

the cold transfer medium reservoirs (5') has a heat
exchanger, through which the compressed refrigerant of

the refrigerant circuit (A) flows, and, after the cooling
