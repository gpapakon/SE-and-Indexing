<ABSTRACT>
Dynamic adjustment of the impact of 
automotive vehicle accelerator pedal (22) position on 

engine inlet air valve (52) position in which a gain 
is varied in accordance with vehicle speed (Vs) and a 

limit varied in accordance with vehicle speed (Vs), 
the gain being applied in a transfer function between 

sensed accelerator pedal position and desired inlet 
air valve position, and the limit being applied to the 

desired inlet air valve position, with the transfer 
function varying in accordance with an operator 

selection from a set of transfer functions.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a method of 
determining a desired degree of opening of an inlet 
air valve in an internal combustion engine. Electronic throttle control (ETC) provided 
in automotive vehicles includes an electrical actuator 
driven by an electrical signal from a controller so as 
to control the position of an engine inlet air or 
throttle valve. When provided in an air-lead engine 
control system in which engine fuelling is controlled 
in response to inlet air rate, ETC provides a platform 
on which a variety of control benefits become 
available. In typical conventional ETC systems, an 
accelerator pedal position sensor communicates a 
driver commanded engine operating point to a 
controller. The controller in turn determines a 
desired throttle position and generates a digital 
command appropriate to drive the throttle valve 
position towards the desired throttle valve position 
in accordance with an applied control function. The 
generated command is used to drive an actuator, such 
as a motor, which rotates with the throttle valve. Thus, ETC can provide a mapping between 
sensed accelerator pedal motion and desired throttle 
valve motion. Such mapping is known not to be fixed. 
For example, conventionally known inputs attributed to 
vehicle cruise control, idle speed control, traction 
control, and engine torque management may override 
such mapping temporarily, driving the throttle valve 
position away from a position corresponding to sensed 
accelerator pedal position. Furthermore, as described 
in US-A-4,597,049, the gain applied between 
accelerator pedal motion and throttle valve motion may  
 
be made variable for improved performance and 
controllability. The present invention seeks to provide an 
improved method of determining a desired throttle 
valve position. According to an aspect of the present 
invention, there is provided a method of determining a 
desired degree of opening of an inlet air valve in an 
internal combustion engine of a vehicle as specified 
in claim 1. According to another aspect of the present 
invention, there is provided a method of determining a 
desired degree of opening of an inlet air valve in an 
internal combustion engine of a vehicle as specified 
in claim 8. Advantages in vehicle control, derivability, 
and performance may be available through variable 
mapping. It may be desirable under certain driving 
conditions to limit throttle authority or to redefine 
ETC control resolution. For example, it may be 
desirable at low vehicle speeds to restrict
