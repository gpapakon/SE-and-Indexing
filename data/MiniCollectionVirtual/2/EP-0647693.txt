<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to waste liquor from the chemical-thermal digestion of ready-processed binder-containing chipboard and fibre board. The waste liquor is produced in a process in which ready-processed wooden chipboard and fibre board is first of all comminuted to give chips and, in the next step, these chips are digested by a chemical-thermal method which disintegrates the wood microstructure. The liquid obtained after separating off the celluloses is isolated as waste liquor.

Waste liquor which is obtained from the chemical-thermal
disintegration of already processed binder-containing

chipboards and fibreboards with subsequent separation of
cellulose which waste liquor can be used as extenders for

binders of wood-based materials.
Waste liquor according to claim 1, 
characterised in that

the waste liquor is concentrated and to it is added a means
for adjusting the pH value.
Waste liquor according to claim 1 or 2, 
characterised in
that
 the used chipboards and fibreboards are bonded with
aminoplastic resins.
Waste liquor according to claim 1 or 2, 
characterised in
that
 the used chipboards and fibreboards contain a binder
with a base of phenolic resins.
Waste liquor according to claim 1 or 2, 
characterised in
that
 the used chipboards and fibreboards contain a binder
with a base of polymer diisocyanate (PMDI).
Method for producing the waste liquor according to one of
the preceding claims, 
characterised in that
 already
processed woodchip- and woodfibre-boards are chopped up

firstly into wood chips and subsequently broken down by
disintegration of the woody structure according to a

chemical-thermal method known in itself, the liquid
occurring after separation of the cellulose materials being

separated as waste liquor.
Method according to claim 6, 
characterised in that
 the
disintegration procedure for the already processed

woodchip- and woodfibre-boards is the sulphate procedure. 
Method according to claim 6, 
characterised in that
 the
disintegration procedure for the already processed

woodchip- and woodfibre-boards is the sulphite procedure.
Method according to claim 6, 
characterised in that
 the
disintegration procedure for the already processed

woodchip- and woodfibre-boards is the organosolvprocedure.
Use of the waste liquor occurring during the chemical-thermal
disintegration of already processed chipboards and

fibreboards according to one of the claims 1 to 5 as an
extender for binders of wood-based materials.
Use according to claim 10, 
characterised in that
 the waste
liquor is used as an extender for a urea formaldehyde

resin.
Use according to claim 10, 
characterised in that
 the waste
liquor is used as an extender for a phenol formaldehyde

resin.
Use according to claim 10, 
characterised in that
 the waste
liquor is used as an extender for a tannin formaldehyde

resin.
Use according to claim 10, 
characterised in that
 the waste
liquor is used as an extender for a polysaccharide such as

starch or pectin.
Use according to claim 10, 
characterised in that
 the waste
liquor is used as an extender for a polysaccharide

derivative such as starch acetate or starch propionate.
Use according to claim 10, 
characterised in that
 the waste
liquor is used as an extender for a protein.
