<ABSTRACT>
In a method for the production of a helically or annularly corrugated metal tube (10), a metal strip (2) is drawn from a supply coil (1) and formed to give a slotted tube which is longitudinally seam welded, whereupon a helical or annular corrugation is imparted to the welded tube by means of an annular corrugating tool (9) revolving eccentrically with respect to the longitudinal axis of the tube. During this process, a slotted tube with a ratio of the external diameter D to the wall thickness s of over 100 is formed, the slotted tube is welded with a laser or by means of pulsed TIG welding and the corrugation is produced with a ratio of corrugating pitch T or corrugation spacing Tp to corrugating depth t of less than 3.75.
