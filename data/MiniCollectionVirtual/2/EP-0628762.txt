<ABSTRACT>
In order to provide a hand tool (100) having a drive (14), in particular in the form of a chain saw or hedge clipper, the hand tool (100) being equipped with two handles (11, 12) and a switching member (13) intended for controlling the drive (14), and having a safety member (15, 16) on each of the two handles (11, 12) to ensure two-handed operation, which safety member cooperates with the switching member (13) in such a way that an actuation of the switching member (13) can take place only upon gripping both handles (11, 12), the safety circuit for the two-handed operation of which hand tool is not susceptible to failure, is easy and safe to operate and is readily adaptable to various circumstances, it is proposed that at least one of the two safety members (15, 16) is constructed in the form of an electrically active linear sensor and controls the drive (14) via a control logic (20) designed as a low-voltage circuit.
