<ABSTRACT>
A computer graphics system is provided for clipping a graphical 
polygon to a clip region, the polygon being defined by multiple vertices 

with connecting edges, including the steps of computing which vertices 
of a polygon to be displayed may be discarded and computing at least one 

color factor only for vertices not discarded, computing boundary 
vertices on any edges that intersect a clip region boundary and 

computing at least one color factor therefor, and displaying the 
vertices according to the computed color factors.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates generally to computer graphics 
systems and more particularly to a method and apparatus for clipping 
polygons to a clip region. In computer graphics systems, it is desired to represent two and 
three dimensional graphical pictures on a two dimensional display. 
Typically, such a picture is a construct or image that may be stored in 
memory as a set of polygons. To generate the picture on the display, 
the polygons are then rendered using processes that are typically 
computationally intensive. However, a portion of the picture to be 
represented may fall outside the field of vision provided by a window on 
the display or by the display itself. In such cases, it may be 
desirable to clip the picture and the polygons comprising the picture as 
the picture is being generated, thereby reducing computational 
requirements and increasing rendering speed. Polygon clipping is the process of removing that portion of a 
polygon that lies outside a region called the clip region. A polygon is 
typically specified as a set of vertices P(0), P(1), ..., P(n-2), P(n-1), 
where n is the number of vertices in the polygon. The vertices of 
the polygon are specified such that the interior of the polygon lies to 
the left of the edges formed by consecutive vertices. Each vertex P(i) 
is specified by its location V(i) in a suitable coordinate space and a 
function, referred to herein as a color factor, f(V(i)). A color factor 
is a function evaluated at each vertex that may be displayed later as a 
color (including a grayscale) variation (such as a light intensity, a 
thermal characteristic, a humidity factor, etc.). The color factor may 
be converted to a color and is useful in modelling (such as simple 
lighting modelling or more complex weather modelling). The function or 
color factor, f(V(i)), is generally not evaluated at the start of the 
clipping technique and is typically evaluated only when there is a need 
due to the computational resources needed for evaluating the function. Function or color factor interpolation is the process of computing 
the function or color factor value at a newly created vertex P(k) at 
location V(k). Function or color factor interpolation is generally  
 
performed when clipping at the intersection of the polygon and the 
boundary of the clip region. Typically, function or color factor 
interpolation is possible for evaluating f(V(k)) when V(i), f(V(i)), 
V(j), f(V(j)), and V(k) are known. In the traditional graphics pipeline, lighting (an example of 
functio
