<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a compact optical device making it possible to superimpose, on the visible image, an intensified infrared image permitting night vision. It is particularly applicable to the construction of goggles which can be carried beneath the visor of a pilot's helmet, for example an aeroplane or helicopter pilot. The device according to the invention includes:   . a mixer (ME) placed in front of the pilot's eye and transmitting visible light directly to the pilot; . an objective (OIL) receiving the infrared light and placed above the mixer; . optical means for guiding the light received by the objective to the mixer, bound for the pilot's eye, this guiding taking place in one and the same plane which is substantially perpendicular to that of the light received by the objective, the guiding means including:     - a light intensifier (IL);   - a transmitting (transport) objective; - an even number of mirrors for folding back the optical path (circuit);   - an eyepiece.

<CLAIMS>
Optical device for night vision of a landscape,
comprising a mixer (M
E
) and means (IL) for forming an
intensified visible image from an infrared image

received, the device being characterized in that the
mixer is situated along a first direction (33) in front

of the eye (O) of the observer and transmits the
visible light (33) directly to the observer, the device

furthermore comprising:

an objective (O
IL
) receiving the infrared light
(22) along a s
econd direction (22), parallel to
the first, the first and second directions

defining a first plane (YOZ);
optical means for guiding the light received by
the objective to the mixer, the guidance being

performed in a second plane, this second plane
making an angle (α) different from 90° with the

first plane, these optical guidance means
comprising:


optical means for returning the light received
by the objective to the second plane;
the means (IL) receiving the infrared light
captured by the objective;
a transport objective (O
T1
, O
T2
, O
T3
);
a number n of mirrors (M
1
, M
2
, M
3
, M
4
), n
depending on the number of objectives of the device;
an eyepiece (O
C
);

the first direction (33) meeting the second plane
in a first point (B) and the second direction (22) 

meeting the second plane in a second point (A),
the line joining the first and second points being

perpendicular to the first direction, the mixer
reflecting the image arising from the eyepiece along

the first direction, towards the eye of the observer.
Device according to Claim 1, characterized in
that the said angle between the first and second planes

is of the order of 110°.
Device according to one of the preceding
claims, characterized in that the number n of mirrors

is even.
Device according to one of the preceding
claims, characterized in that the number n of mirrors

is equal to four.
Device according to one of the preceding
claims, characterized in that it furthermore comprises

optical means (P) for returning the infrared light from
the objective to the means for forming an intensified

visible image.
Night vision goggles, characterized in that
they comprise two devices according to one of the

preceding claims, one device for each eye of the
observer, and means (40) for adjusting the interocular

distance.
Goggles according to Claim 6, characterized in
that the means for adjusting the interocular distance

translate each of the devices along an axis contained
in the plane of the guidance means.
