<ABSTRACT>
In a glass front-panel (1) for a cathode ray tube (12), 
whose surface layer contains more potassium ions than those in the 

interior thereof, and whose flange (1c) is stuck to a rear panel 
(10) to form a vacuum vessel, the surface layer of the flange 

portion (1c) is substantially removed or eluted. A belt-like 
electrode (2) for making the gradient of electric potential smoother 

is disposed on a surface of the side wall portion (1b), so that 
the cathode ray tube (12) is prevented from being damaged due to 

dielectric breakdown.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates generally to a cathode ray
tube for an electronic display, on which a pictorial image
is produced, and more particularly is directed to a glass
front-panel for a cathode ray tube, which is available for a
thin image-display apparatus.As a thin image-display apparatus, an apparatus
displaying an image by means of a matrix drive system is
known, for example, as disclosed in Journal of the Society
of Television Engineers, Vol. 40, No. 10.1024 (1986). A
glass front-panel for a cathode ray tube available for an
image display apparatus comprises an image displaying
portion with a flat surface, a side wall portion contiguous
to the image displaying portion, and a flange portion
crookedly contiguous to the side wall portion, for example,
as disclosed in Japanese Laid-open Patent Publication No.
62-153148. The glass front-panel is stuck, with glass frit
or the like, to a rear panel made of, for example, a metal
plate to form a vacuum vessel.In such image display apparatus, an electron beam
is emitted by an electron gun unit comprising a group of
electron-beam-controlling electrodes with a matrix array,
and irradiates a phosphor provided on the inner surface of
the image displaying portion of the glass front-panel to 
display an image. To impress the voltage of an electric
source to the electron gun unit, a line connecting the
electron gun unit to an external terminal is provided. The
line passes, for example, through a joint portion, that is,
the glass frit lying between the glass front-panel and the
rear panel.However, during the image displaying, a high
voltage of several kV or more is generated between the image
displaying portion of the glass front-panel and the external
terminal connected to the line passing through the
glass frit, which lies between the front panel and the rear
panel, so that an electric charge accumulated on the surface of the front
glass panel is abruptly released through the bonding layer of glass frit,
and this phenomenon gives rise to a crack on the surface of the bonding
layer or of the front panel.The present invention
can provide a glass front-panel for a cathode ray
tube, which is available for an image displaying apparatus,
wherein damages due to dielectric breakdown are not caused,
during image displaying, in a surface of the glass front-panel
or in a glass frit or the like, with which the glass
front-panel and a rear panel are stuck together, no
deterioration in color is undergone if the glass front-panel
is exposed to an electron beam, and the mechanical

comprising an image displaying portion (1a), a side wall

portion (1b) contiguous the image displaying portion, and a
flange portion (1c) contiguous the side wall portion, and

having a surface layer containing more potassium ions than the
interior thereof so as to be resistive to coloring action by

an electron beam as a result of the surface layer undergoing
ion exchange treatment in molten salt containing potassium

ions, characterised in that a belt-like electrode (2) having
