<ABSTRACT>
This invention relates to an improved hydrogenation process wherein 
aromatic amines are hydrogenated to their ring hydrogenated counterparts. 

These aromatic amines are presented by the formulas: 

wherein R is hydrogen or C₁₋₆ aliphatic, R1 and R2 are hydrogen or C₁₋₆ 
aliphatic, A is C₁₋₄ or NH; n is 0-2, x is 1-3 and y is 1 to 2 except the 

sum of the y groups in Formula I may be 1. The improvement resides in the 
utilization of a catalyst comprising rhodium carried on a support of kappa, 

theta or delta alumina.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention pertains to a process for hydrogenating aromatic 
amines to produce their ring hydrogenated counterparts. There is substantial literature in the art with respect to the 
hydrogenation of aromatic amines, including bridged aromatic amines, 
e.g., methylenedianiline to produce 4,4'-methylenedi(cyclohexylamine), 
also called bis(para-aminocyclohexyl)methane, 
bis(4-aminocyclohexyl)methane and PACM. Some of the early hydrogenation work to produce aromatic amines, 
such as, PACM, was done by Whitman and Barkdoll, et al. and their work 
is set forth in a series of U.S. Patents, e.g., 2,511,028; 2,606,924; 
2,606,925; and 2,606,928. Basically the processes described in these 
patents involve the hydrogenation of methylenedianiline at pressures in 
excess of 1.38 MPa (200 psig), preferably in excess of 6.89 MPa (1,000 psig), at temperatures 
within a range of 80 to 275°C utilizing a ruthenium catalyst. The 
hydrogenation is carried out under liquid phase conditions and an inert 
organic solvent is used in the hydrogenation process. Typically, a 
liquid product having a trans,trans- isomer content of 15-23% is 
obtained. Examples of ruthenium catalysts utilized for the 
hydrogenation process include ruthenium oxides such as ruthenium 
sesquioxide and ruthenium dioxide; and ruthenium salts. Brake, et al. in 3,644,522 continued in the 
development of processes for manufacturing PACM by hydrogenating 
methylenedianiline. They found that if the ruthenium was carried upon a 
support and the support was alkali-moderated, the catalyst was much more 
active and catalytically effective in producing the desired hydrogenated 
PACM product. Alkali moderation was effected by contacting the catalyst 
and support with alkali metal hydroxide or an alkoxide; also, such 
alkali moderation of the catalyst could be effected prior to 
hydrogenation or in situ during the hydrogenation. U.S. Patents 3,347,917; 3,711,550; 3,679,746; 3,155,724; 3,766,272 
and British Patent 1,122,609 disclose various isomerization processes 
and hydrogenation processes to produce PACM containing high trans,trans- isomer  
 
content; i.e. an isomer content near equilibrium typically 50% 
trans,trans-, 43% cis,trans- and 7% cis,cis-. As in the early work 
ruthenium catalysts usually were used to effect isomerization. High 
temperatures and longer reaction times were required to produce the high 
trans,trans- product and, in addition, considerable deamination of 
product took place. A wide variety of catalytic systems have been developed for
