<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a diffuser for fitting in ducts through which fluids pass, in particular upstream of heat exchangers, silencers, admixing devices and the like, preferably for power stations, having built-in elements generating vortices. In order to avoid separation of the flow from the diffuser wall in a diffuser of this type and ensure uniform expansion of the flow over the widening flow section 2 at a low cost and with low pressure losses, a built-in area 4, producing at least one leading-edge vortex system, is arranged as built-in element in the region of the diverging flow section 2 of the diffuser.

<CLAIMS>
Diffuser for installing in lines through which 
fluids flow, in particular upstream of heat exchangers, 

silencers, admixing devices and the like, preferably for 
power stations, having built-in components which generate 

eddies, characterized in that at least one built-in 
surface (4), which is set at an acute angle to the main 

flow direction and generates a front edge eddy-producing 
system, is arranged as built-in component in the region 

of the diverging flow section (2) of the diffuser. 
Diffuser according to Claim 1, characterized in 
that a plurality of built-in components (4) are arranged 

next to and/or one behind the other in the diverging flow 
section (2) of the diffuser. 
Diffuser according to Claim 1 or 2, characterized 
in that each built-in surface (4) has a symmetrical edge 

profile with a plane of symmetry extending in the main 
flow direction. 
Diffuser according to one of Claims 1 to 3, 
characterized in that each built-in surface (4) is 

constructed with a circular, elliptical, oval, parabolic, 
rhomboid or triangular basic shape. 
Diffuser according to at least one of Claims 1 to 
4, characterized in that the built-in surface (4) is 

constructed with a V-shaped profile in cross-section 
and/or provided with a bent rim.
