<ABSTRACT>
A lockable linkage assembly comprises a first linkage member 
(1) having a slot into which can be inserted an end section 

of a second linkage member in the form of a tongue (9). The 
tongue includes a recess which engages an edge of the sl
ot to 
retain the two together. A locking member in the form of a 

locking tongue (17) is insertable in the slot to thereby lock 
the tongue in the slot until the locking member is withdrawn.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a lockable linkage assembly 
of a general type particularly suited to use with temporary 
and permanent traffic signs, although the linkage assembly in 
accordance to the present invention has many uses as will be 
apparent to those skilled in the art and is not limited to 
temporary traffic signs or temporary traffic barriers. Temporary traffic barriers and traffic signs are well known 
features of road maintenance and have become progressively 
more sophisticated as traffic speeds increase and road and 
motorway maintenance becomes more complex. Temporary traffic 
barriers are utilised to denote the edge of works on the 
motorway, but are also used by public utilities to prevent the 
public from inadvertently falling into holes, and during 
exhibitions, festivals etc to denote the edges of public 
access. Such temporary barriers should be readily erected and 
dismantled, and provide a suitable barrier which it is 
relatively difficult to cross and prevents at least 
inadvertent access to an area. A problem in connection with temporary signage and barrier 
arrangements is that it is the conventional practice to 
provide such barriers and signs in metal for durability. The 
difficulty with such arrangements it that the parts are heavy  
 
to carry and if hit by a car or moving machinery can fly about 
and cause serious injury. What is required is a barrier which 
is light, stable, provided with a strong linkage to prevent 
undesired disassembly, and sufficiently resilient such that 
blows can be absorbed without disassembly or destruction of 
the parts. In prior art linkages for temporary traffic barriers, post and 
rail arrangements have been provided with a beaded cord 
linkage to locate the rail upon a post. After a short while 
such arrangements tend to disassemble and the beaded cord 
tends to break if hit and to be readily removed by 
unauthorised personnel. Another type of prior art linkage is the button and slot 
arrangement wherein a pair of buttons are located in a spaced 
relation at the end of a hollow extruded rail member, said 
buttons engaging in elongate slots in the post. The rail is 
retained in the slot by its own weight. It will be immediately 
apparent that especially after a little wear the rail maybe 
inadvertently removed from the post, maybe readily 
disassembled on being hit by machinery, and is open to ready 
vandalisation. The present invention seeks to provide a cheap and readily 
utilisable solution to at least some of these problems to 
prov

<CLAIMS>
A linkage assembly comprising 

a) a first linkage member comprising a first slot 
b) a second linkage member comprising a slot engagement 
tongue provided with an engagement recess whereby 

interengagement or the tongue in the slot and relative 
movement of tongue and the slot allows engagement of the 

recess with an edge of the slot to prevent disengagement of 
the second member while the recess is engaged therein; 
 
   characterised in that said slot comprises a first 

slot section for receiving the tongue, and a second slot 
section for sliding interengagement with said tongue, and in 

that a locking member comprising a locking tongue is movable 
in relation to said second member to enter said first slot 

section thereby to retain the recess engaged in the second 
section o
f the slot until the locking tongue is withdrawn. 
A linkage assembly according to claim 1 wherein the first 
member is a post comprising at least one slot extending along 

the longitudinal axis of the post. 
A linkage assembly according to claim 1 or 2 wherein said 
first slot section has a lateral extent greater than a 

thickness of the tongue. 
A linkage assembly according to any preceding claim wherein 
the locking member is slidable from a released position to an 

 
engaged position, and wherein the second linkage member and 

the locking member include retaining means to reversibly 
retain said locking member in the engaged position. 
A linkage assembly according to any preceding claim wherein 
the second member is an elongate rail having a generally 

planar configuration, the tongue being integrally formed in 
an end section of the rail. 
A linkage assembly according to claim 5 wherein said rail 
comprises a secondary tongue for interengagement in a 

secondary slot spaced from said first slot. 
A linkage assembly according to claim 5 or 6 wherein the 
rail is provided with a radius portion at least at its 

intended upper edge. 
A linkage assembly according to claim 5, 6 or 7 wherein a 
cutaway portion is provided adjacent the end of the rail 

extending from or near said recess to allow for angular 
displacement in the plane of the rail. 
A linkage assembly according to any preceding claim, 
wherein the locking tongue is closely received in the first 

slot section of the assembled assembly. 
A linkage assembly according to any of Claims 2 to 9 
wherein the intended lower end of the post is substantially 

 
circular in cross-section and wherein a base is provided for 

cooperation therewith, said base comprising a vertically 
extending bore which is a bare clearance fit for said post 

end, the post end comprising a lug cooperating in a 
corresponding keyway in said vertically extending bore, said 

keyway terminating in a circumferentially extending groove to 
locate said lug and secure the post to the base when 

relatively rotated or wherein the post has a bell-ended lower 
section for engagement with a downwardly facing surface of the 

base. 
A linkage assembly according to any preceding claim 
further comprising an information display means including a 

planar display surface. 
A linkage assembly according to claim 11, wherein the 
information display means includes resilient means adapted to 

engage the post to restrict relative rotational movement 
between the information display means and the post. 
A traffic signage system comprising; 
a base including an arcuate aperture; and 

a sign including a planar display surface and an arcuate sign 
support section for insertion in the base aperture so as to 

connect the sign and the base together.
