<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an isobutylene polymer having 
at least one silicon-containing group cross-linkable by the 
formation of a siloxane bond (hereinafter referred to as 
"cross-linkable silicon group") at the molecular ends, a 
curable composition containing the same, and a cured product 
thereof. An organic rubber polymer having a cross-linkable silicon 
group is an organic polymer having a silicon-containing group 
cross-linkable by forming a siloxane bond, and has such an 
interesting property as it is cured even at ordinary temperature 
to form a rubber-like elastomer, as shown in the following 
formula. 
wherein X' is a hydrolyzable group The above polymer has a similar curing property to that of a 
room temperature-vulcanizable polysiloxane. Moreover, it can 
have properties that the polysiloxane does not have since its 
main chain is not a polysiloxane but an organic polymer. As 
the organic polymer having a cross-linkable silicon group, a 
polyether having cross-linkable silicon group is disclosed in US-A-3  
 
981 751. However, its properties such as weatherability, 
water-resistance and heat-resistance are not sufficient and, 
therefore, the polyether is sometimes restricted in its use. GB-A-2 110 706 and US-A-3 644 315 describe isobutylene 
copolymers and isobutylene polymers, respectively, containing 
at least one silicon-containing group cross-linkable by the 
formation of a siloxane bond. However, the tensile strength 
and the elongation at break of these polymers are rather low. Therefore, the object of the present invention is to provide 
polymers having a cross-linkable silicon group with 
excellent weatherability, water-resistance and heat-resistance, 
and excellent tensile strength and elongation at break, a 
composition containing the same, and the cured product 
thereof. According to the present invention, this object is achieved 
by providing an isobutylene polymer having at least one 
silicon-containing group cross-linkable by the formation 
of a siloxane bond at the molecular ends. The isobutylene polymer is a polymer curable at ordinary 
temperature and having not only excellent weatherability, 
water-resistance and heat-resistance but also excellent 
electric isolation and gas impermeability as well as excellent 
tensile strength and elongation at break. Furthermore, the present invention relates to a composition 
containing the above isobutylene polymer and silanol 
condensation catalysts. According to a further aspect the present invention relates 
to a cured
