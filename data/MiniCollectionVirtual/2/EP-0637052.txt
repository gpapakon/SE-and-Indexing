<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a method and a generator for 
producing an aluminum ion flow, specifically for aluminum 

ion implantation in the microelectronics industry. The 
method comprises the following steps: 


supplying a stream of an ionization gas into the 
ionization chamber; 
providing an amount of an aluminum-containing feed 
material inside the ionization chamber; 
generating, within the ionization chamber, an electron 
flow by supplying an electrode with a large current; 
bombarding the ionization gas stream with the electron 
flow to create a plasma; 
causing the plasma to attack the feed material so as to 
become enriched with aluminum ions; 
taking the plasma out of the ionization chamber; 
removing from the plasma, by application of a magnetic 
field, those ions which have a significantly different 

equivalent weight from the equivalent weight of the 
aluminum ions;

 
all this having selected the ionization gas and feed 

material such that, in the plasma taken out of the 
ionization chamber, there will be aluminum ions present 

along with other ions, all having different equivalent 
weights from the equivalent weight of the aluminum ions.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a method for producing a stream 
of ionic aluminum, specially intended for aluminum ion 
implantation in the microelectronics industry. EP-A- 0 439 220 describes an ion stream generator 
for producing a stream of metal ions. In this 
generator the following step are carried out: 
supplying a stream of an ionization gas into an 
ionization chamber ; providing an amount of a feed 
material containing the metal to be ionized inside the ionization chamber ; generating, within the ionization chamber, an 
electron flow by supplying an electrode with a large 
current; bombarding the ionization gas stream with the electron 
flow to create a plasma; causing the plasma to attack the feed material so 
as to become enriched with metal ions; drawing out of the ionization chamber a stream of metal ions. The underlying problem of this invention is to produce a 
stream of aluminum ions, specially useful in the  
 
microelectronics industry for the ion implantation of 
aluminum. The idea on which this invention is based is one of 
providing, inside the ionization chamber, a solid feed 
material containing aluminum such that, on attack by the 
plasma, aluminum ions will be released into the plasma. Therefore, the invention relates 
to a method for producing an aluminum ion 
stream, particularly intended for aluminum ion 
implantation in the microelectronics industry, comprising 
the steps of: 
supplying a stream of silicon 
tetrafluoride, SiF4, as an ionization gas into an 
ionization chamber; providing an amount of aluminum 
oxide, Al2O3, as a feed 
material inside the ionization chamber; generating, within the ionization chamber, an electron 
flow by supplying an electrode with a large current; bombarding the ionization gas stream with the electron 
flow to create a plasma; causing the plasma to attack the feed material so as to 
become enriched with aluminum ions; drawing out of the ionization chamber a stream of ionic aluminum; removing from the plasma said stream, by magnetic mass 
separation, those ions which have a significantly different 
equivalent weight from the equivalent weight of the 
aluminum ions. Equivalent weight means here the ratio of weight to 
charge of the ions, since it is this ratio that 
determines the extent of the deflection undergone by each 
ion in the magnetic field, thereby controlling the ion  
 
separation performed by the magnetic field. The aforesaid method provides a substantially pure 
aluminum ion stream, suitable for application to aluminum 
ion
