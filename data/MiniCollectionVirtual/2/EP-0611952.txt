<ABSTRACT>
A position detector which provides improved 
reference position detecting precision by stabilizing the 

output signal from magnetoelectric transducers in a reference 
position part. A rotor (2) has a magnetized surface (5) 

alternately provided with different magnetic poles and a 
reference positional part (5a) in which magnetic poles 

provided on the magnetized surface (5) are partly omitted. A 
rotational angle sensor (6) has MR elements (7A and 7B) laid 

out thereon in opposition to the magnetized surface (5) of 
the rotor (2) to output the voltage signal VS according to 

the magnetic field intensity in the magnetized surface (5) 
due to the rotation of the rotor (2). A waveform processing 

circuit (11) and a pulse signal processing signal (12) shape 
the waveform of the voltage signal (VS) from the rotational 

angle sensor (6), and also generate the rotational angle 
pulse signal (Ne) and a reference position pulse signal (G) 

according to the waveform reforming signal. The reference 
positional part (5a) is arranged so that the magnetic field 

intensity therein can be within the saturation magnetic field 
region of the Mr elements (7A and 7B).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention generally relates to a moving 
position detector. More particularly, the present invention 
relates to a rotational position detector which utilizes 
magnetoelectric transducers having the saturation 
characteristics as to voltage output, such as magnetoelectric 
transducer elements composed of a ferromagnetic material, 
e.g., Ni-Co type alloy and Ni-Fe type alloy (hereinafter 
referred to as "MR elements"), and nonlinear type Hall 
elements. A rotational position detector in which the outer 
periphery of a rotor has a magnetized surface alternately 
provided with different magnetic poles and the magnetized 
surface is detected by using a rotational angle sensor 
utilizing magnetoelectric transducers has been proposed as 
disclosed, for example, in Japanese Unexamined Patent 
Publication No. 54-156656, Japanese Unexamined Utility Model  
 
Publication No. 56-12815 or Japanese Examined Patent 
Publication No. 2-52966. The rotational angle sensor of the above rotational 
position detector comprises a single or a plurality of 
magnetoelectric transducers to obtain the output voltage from 
the rotational angle sensor by means of the magnetoelectric 
transducing action according to the magnetic field intensity. 
On the other hand, the magnetized surface of the rotor is 
alternately provided with different magnetic poles and a 
reference position part magnetized with a larger 
magnetization pitch is formed in part of the magnetized 
surface to have a single unit of rotor and rotational angle 
sensor generates rotational angle signals and reference 
position signals. Furthermore, the waveform of the output 
signal from the rotational angle sensor is shaped, and the 
rotational angle signal is generated according to the 
reference position signal. During this process, the output 
voltage from the magnetoelectric transducer becomes constant 
(e.g., at "0" value) in the reference position part for the 
specified duration, and consequently the reference position 
signal can be obtained. However, in the rotational position detector in the 
above arrangement, when the magnetization pitch of magnetic 
poles is widened as shown in (A) of Fig. 17, the magnetic 
field intensity in the reference position part lowers at the 
central part thereof as shown in (B) of Fig. 17. As a 
result, a swell or fluctuating noise as shown in (C) of Fig.  
 
17 is caused on the output voltage signal from the rotational 
angle sensor in the reference position part according to the 
variation in the magnetic field
