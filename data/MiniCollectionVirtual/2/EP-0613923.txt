<CLAIMS>
A stabilized molding composition of
polyethylene having an average molecular weight of 10
5
 to
10
7
 g/mol comprising a zinc salt of dialkyl
dithiocarbamate having C
6
 to C
16
 chains in the alkyl
group as the antioxidant and α-tocopherol or a

derivative thereof as the stabilizer.
A stabilized molding composition as claimed in
claim 1, wherein the molding composition comprises 0.01

to 1 % by weight of a zinc salt of the dialkyl
dithiocarbamate having C
6
 to C
16
 chains in the alkyl
group as the antioxidant and 0.01 to 0.5 % by weight of

α-tocopherol or a derivative thereof as the stabilizer.
A stabilized molding composition as claimed in
claim 1 or 2, wherein t
he molding composition comprises
3 to 40 % by weight of fibers and/or powder of graphite,

glass, quartz or metals as the filler, and if
appropriate other customary additives, such as color

pigments, lubricants, processing stabilizers or
flameproofing agents.
A process for the preparation of a molding
composition as claimed in one of claims 1 to 3, which 

comprises mixing all the ingredients together, sintering
the mixture under pressures of about 3 to 5 MPa at

temperatures of about 180 to 250° C and cooling the
sintered product under pressures of about 7 to 10 MPa.
A process for the preparation of a molding
composition as claimed in one of claims 1 to 3, which

comprises first mixing the individual components for a
masterbatch of 0.1 to 10 % by weight of antioxidant, 0.1

to 5 % by weight of stabilizer and polyethylene as the
remainder, adjusting the masterbatch to the appropriate

concentration with further polyethylene and if
appropriate mixing it with further additives, and

sintering this mixture under pressures of 3 to 5 MPa at
temperatures of 180 to 250° C and cooling it under

pressures of 7 to 10 MPa.
