<ABSTRACT>
A method for identifying barley with good brewing properties using the thermostability of the barley  beta -amylase as an indicator. The thermostability of the barley  beta -amylase significantly affects the degree of the apparent attenuation limit. A method for determining the enzyme activity of an extract solution from one barley seed, an indirect method by an isoelectric point, and an indirect identifying method by DNA polymorphisms of the region containing the  beta -amylase structural gene have been developed as a method for determining the type of thermostability for a barley  beta -amylase. The selection method is not affected by environmental or climatic conditions.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a method for identifying a barley variety suitable for brewing using the thermostability of β-amylase encoded by the barley variety as an indicator. Furthermore, the invention relates to a method for breeding a barley variety suitable for brewing using the barley variety identified by the method of the present invention.Malting barley is conventionally bred using a traditional mating technique, for the most part comprising the following two steps. In the first step, individuals having different genotype are mated together and subsequently a selection is conducted from many resultant progeny lines based on desirable cultivation properties such as agricultural properties, adaptability to an environment, and resistance to disease, and a selected line is genetically fixed by growing. This step takes in the neighborhood of 5-6 years. After this long first step, in the second step, a malt analysis of many lines selected and grown in the first step is made, and only good barley lines are selected according to the result of the analysis of their brewing property. The selected barley lines are bred for malting barleyIn conventional barley breeding, however, survey and selection of brewing properties cannot be conducted during the first step Therefore, a selection and breeding of agronomic character must be performed from grand scale mated progeny lines and then followed by genetic fixation. Moreover, the existence of a good barley line with favorable brewing properties is not guaranteed.The breeding of a desirable line using this method largely depends on whether an individual breeder can identify a barley having a good brewing property using his experience and observations Therefore, the breeding of a malting barley having the desired brewing properties must rely on the experience of a brilliant breeder.Furthermore, the brewing property used as an indicator for selecting a good line in the conventional method largely depends on environmental and climatic conditions. Therefore, the evaluation of characteristics associated with brewing properties must be conducted over the course of several years.As described above, the conventional method for breeding malting barley with improved brewing properties requires an experienced and skilled barley breeder.
Further, even a highly skilled barley breeder requires a long breeding time and tremendous effort to identify malting barley having good brewing properties.On the other hand, in the past, studies on biochemical differences of β-amylase among
