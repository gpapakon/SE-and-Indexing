<ABSTRACT>
A vibrating gyroscope includes a vibrator having a 
triangular prism shaped vibrating body and piezoelectric 

elements. An oscillation circuit is connected between two 
piezoelectric elements and another piezoelectric element. 

Output signals from two piezoelectric elements are applied 
to input terminals of a differential circuit. The 

differential circuit is connected to a synchronous detecting 
circuit, and the synchronous detecting circuit is connected 

to a smoothing circuit. A temperature compensating capacitor 
is connected between two piezoelectric elements that are 

connected to the differential circuit. The oscillation 
circuit consists of an amplifier and a phase shifter having 

a resistor and a capacitor. As the capacitor used in the 
phase shifter, the temperature compensating capacitor may be 

used.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a vibrating gyroscope,
and particularly to a vibrating gyroscope using bending
vibration of pillar shaped vibrator.FIG. 15 is an illustrating view showing a conventional
vibrating gyroscope. The vibrating gyroscope 1 has a
vibrating body 2 of regular triangular prism shape.
Piezoelectric elements 3a, 3b and 3c are formed on three
side faces of the vibrating body 2. The piezoelectric
elements 3a and 3b are used for driving a bending vibration
on the vibrating body 2, and are also used for detecting
output signal corresponding to a rotational angular
velocity. The piezoelectric element 3c is used for a
feedback when driving the vibrator 2. An oscillation circuit
4 is connected between the piezoelectric elements 3a, 3b and
the piezoelectric element 3c. The piezoelectric elements 3a
and 3b are connected to input terminals of a differential
circuit 5. An output terminal of the differential circuit 5 
is connected to a synchronous detecting circuit 6. The
synchronous detecting circuit 6 is connected to a smoothing
circuit 7.In this vibrating gyroscope 1, the vibrating body 2
vibrates in bending mode in the direction perpendicular to
the face that the piezoelectric element 3c is formed, in
accordance with a driving signal generated by the
oscillation circuit 4. When the vibrating gyroscope 1
rotates around an axis of the vibrating body 2, a vibrating
motion of the vibrating body 2 changes a direction by
Coriolis force. It causes a difference of output signals
between the piezoelectric elements 3a and 3b, and the
difference is obtained from the differential circuit 5. A
signal corresponding to the rotational angular velocity
applied to the vibrating gyroscope 1 is obtained by
detecting an output signal from the differential circuit 5
and smoothing a measured signal.As shown in FIG. 16, the oscillation circuit 4
includes, for example, an amplifier 8 and a phase shifter
9 connected with each other. As the phase shifter 9, a CR
filter having a resistor and a capacitor is used.In the vibrating gyroscope 1, the signal from the
piezoelectric element 3c for feedback is amplified by the
amplifier 8, and a phase of the signal is modulated by the
phase shifter 9. The vibrating body 2 is self-oscillated by 
applying an output signal from the phase shifter 9 to the
piezoelectric elements 3a and 3b for driving.In the vibrating gyroscope 1 shown in FIG. 15, however,
a detecting sensitivity is affected by a variation of the
environment temperature. A temperature characteristic of
the detecting
