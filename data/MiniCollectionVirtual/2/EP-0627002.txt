<ABSTRACT>
Monoclonal antibodies are provided which are specific for human interleukin-4. Also provided are complementary DNAs which encode the heavy and light chain variable regions of such monoclonal antibodies and complementarity determining regions from such DNAs; and kits and methods for detecting, measuring and immunopurifying human interleukin-4, and for blocking the biological activity of human interleukin-4.

<DESCRIPTION>
Human interleukin-4 (IL-4) was first cloned and
characterized by Yokota et al. [Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. 83:5894
(1986)]. IL-4 is a highly pleiotropic lymphokine which affects
many different components of the immune system. It has T
cell growth factor (TCGF) activity, and B cell growth factor
activity. It is capable of potentiating the TCGF activity of
interleukin-2 (IL-2) and the colony-forming activity of
granulocyte-macrophage colony stimulating factor (GM-CSF).
It induces the preferential production of IgG1 and IgE, induces
the low affinity receptor for IgE (CD23), and induces the
expression of human leukocyte class II DR antigens.These activities suggest several possible
therapeutic uses for IL-4, e.g., as an anti-tumor agent
[Tepper et al., Cell 57:503 (1989)], a potentiating agent for
IL-2 anticancer therapy, as a potentiating agent for
GM-CSF-stimulated bone marrow regeneration, or as an agent
to treat bare lymphocyte syndrome [Touraine, Lancet, pgs.
319-321 (February 7, 1981); Touraine et al., Human
Immunology 2:147 (1981); and Sullivan et al., J. Clin. Invest.
76:75 (1985)]. IL-4 and IL-4 agonists are thus potentially
useful therapeutic agents.The IgE- and CD23-inducing activity of IL-4 could
have important consequences for persons suffering from
allergic diseases. The availability of IL-4 antagonists could
provide an alternative to the use of glucocorticoid steroids,
which have many deleterious side effects, especially with
prolonged usage [Goodman and Gillman, The PharmacologicalBasis of Therapeutics, 6th Ed. (MacMillan Publishing Company,
New York, 1980)].Strongly blocking monoclonal antibodies specific
for human IL-4 provide a means for constructing agonists or
antagonists by generating anti-idiotype antibodies (U.S. patent
4,731,237) or by mimotope screening [Geysen et al., J.
Immunol. Meth. 102:259 (1987); PCT patent applications WO
86/00991 and WO 86/06487].WO 89/03846 discloses a rodent monoclonal antibody
produced by hybridoma MP4.25D2.11.Because most monoclonal antibodies (including the
above) are of rodent cell origin, however, there is a
possibility that they would be immunogenic if used
therapeutically in a human being, particularly if used over a
long period of time. To avoid this possibility, it would be
desirable to have human antibodies, or "humanized"
antibodies, against human IL-4.Initial efforts to reduce the immunogenicity of
rodent antibodies involved the production of chimeric
antibodies, in which mouse variable regions were fused with
human constant regions [Liu et al.,
