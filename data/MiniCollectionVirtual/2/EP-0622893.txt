<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to digital signal processing and
more particularly to a method and apparatus for normalising
a complex signal. The invention has particular application
in receivers that process frequency modulated signals.Prior art communication receivers use digital signal
processing (DSP) for many of the basic receiver functions
such as frequency translation, filtering, and demodulation.
See for example, U. S. Patent No. 4,592,074 which uses DSP
for frequency translation and filtering. In general, DSP
permits receivers to be designed with higher performance,
accuracy, and flexibility.Figure 1 is a block diagram of a prior art FM receiver,
with signal demodulation and other functions performed by
DSP. Analog front end circuitry processes the signal
received at the antenna and inputs the processed analog
signal to an analog-to-digital converter (A/D), which
digitises the signal. The analog processing may include
gain, frequency translation, and filtering. The digital
output of the A/D converter is processed by DSP circuitry
that may perform gain, frequency translation and filtering
functions in the digital domain to isolate the signal in the
desired receiver channel. The desired signal is then input
to the FM demodulator, which outputs the baseband signal,
which is the FM composite signal for standard FM broadcast.FM can be described mathematically as phase modulation
of a carrier by the integral of the modulating (or baseband)
signal, as discussed in Solid State Radio Engineering, by
Krauss, Bostian, and Raab, published by John Wiley and Sons,
1980. Thus, the demodulation process for FM can be
described as the derivative of the phase of the modulated
carrier.It is common in DSP-based receivers to process the
receive signal in complex from, i.e. with real (in-phase or
I) and imaginary (quadrature-phase or Q) components. In
general, using a complex representation has advantages in 
frequency translation and demodulation, and allows sample
rates to be reduced. A single carrier in complex form can
be represented diagrammatically as a single phasor in the
real-imaginary signal plane, with the real and imaginary
coordinates of the phasor's tip equal to I and Q
respectively, as shown in Figure 2. The magnitude M of the
carrier is the length of the phasor, and the phase of the
carrier is the angle P from the real axis, as shown. Thus,
one prior art FM demodulation scheme is to calculate the
phase equal to the arctangent of Q divided by I, then take
the derivative of the phase to obtain the baseband
