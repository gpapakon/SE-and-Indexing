Lateral restraint device for a motor vehicle seat comprising two
cushioning pads (5, 6; 10, 11) having a profiled transverse section, each

comprising a body (10b, 11b) made of plastics foam material and a
support (10c, 11c) of rigid material on which the body of flexible material

is secured, produced in the form of a plate shaped at one of its ends to
constitute a hook (12) for attachment of the associated pad (5, 6; 10, 11) on

the upper part of the back (8) of the motor vehicle seat, in engagement on
the back (8) of the vehicle seat in dispositions substantially parallel

following the height of the seat back and at a predetermined spacing,
characterised by the fact that it has at least two connecting strips (15a, 15b)

between the two pads (5, 6; 10, 11) having an adjustable length and each
made up of two parts joined at one of their ends to a pad (5, 6; 10, 11), the

said parts being formed at least partially of a hooked textile material to
achieve the connection of the one to the other.
