<ABSTRACT>
A procedure for determining a parameter (Cb, D, K, Kt/V) indicating the progress of an extracorporeal blood treatment carried out in a blood-treatment apparatus provided with means for circulating the blood of a patient and a treatment liquid on either side of the semi-permeable membrane of a membrane exchanger, comprises the steps of:   - successively circulating in the exchanger three treatment liquids having a characteristic Cd connected with at least one of the parameters indicative of the treatment (Cb, D, K, Kt/V), the value of the characteristic in the first liquid upstream of the exchanger being different from the value of the characteristic in the second liquid upstream of the exchanger, and the latter being itself different from the value of the characteristic in the third liquid upstream of the exchanger, - measuring in each of the three treatment liquids two values (Cd1in, Cd1out; Cd2in, Cd2out; Cd3in, Cd3out) of the characteristic (Cd), respectively upstream and downstream of the exchanger, and - calculating at least one value of at least one parameter indicating the progress of the treatment (Cb, D, K, Kt/V) on the basis of the measured values of the characteristic (Cd) in the first (d1), the second (d2), and the third (d3) treatment liquids.
