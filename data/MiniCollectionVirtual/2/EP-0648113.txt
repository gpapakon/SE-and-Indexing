^"BIOADHESIVE SOLID MINERAL OILEMULSION'Field of the Invention5 This invention relates to bioadhesive aqueous min¬ eral oil emulsions, more particularly to viscous, film- forming, bioadhesive solid aqueous mineral oil emulsion ointment bases which are readily spreadable and adapted for topical application, to pharmaceutical compositions 10 and products comprising them and to their use, e.g., in the healing of wounds.Background of the Invention Aqueous mineral oil emulsions have long been known and used in formulating topical cosmetic and pharmaceu- 15 tical compositions. Generally speaking, bioadhesiveness, thereof, i.e., the ability of a thick coating thereof to adhere tenaciously to moist skin or a mucosal surface to which it is applied, is not a particularly important functional requirement. One end-use area in which bio- 20 adhesiveness is an important factor is pharmaceutical compositions which are applied to wounds to promote the healing thereof. Often, the fluid exudate from the wound * tends to create a barrier between the therapeutic agent or agents in the medicament applied to the wound and the 25 exposed surface area of the wound. Alternatively, the exudate will physically dislodge the medicament from the wound area, particularly in the inside of the mouth, where copious amounts of saliva usually are present. In 

the case of a covered wound, the exudate can promote the absorption of the medicament into the wound covering and away from the surface of the wound.As a class, aqueous mineral oil emulsions have poor bioadhesiveness and the more viscous the emulsions, the more likely it is to not form a bond to the surface of the wound, particularly when the wound is moist. This problem of non-adherence is particularly acute in the case of wounds, ulcers and lesions on the inside of the mouth. There saliva often prevents even initial adher¬ ence to the wound area or rapidly causes dislodgement of the medication from the wound area.It has now been found that certain aqueous mineral oil emulsions can be rendered bioadhesive by the combina- tion of a hydratable particulate cellulose derivative and a water-dispersible polymer which inhibits the hydration of the cellulose derivative prior to its application to the wound area. It has further been found that these novel aqueous mineral oil vehicles are excellent vehicles for wound-healing promoters, including growth factors such as TGFα.Summary of the Invention In one composition aspect, this invention relates to an ointment base adapted for cosmetic and
