<ABSTRACT>
Foundation for seats in vehicles, comprising mechanisms for compensating for the tilt of 
the vehicle cab in at least one plane, so that a mounting plate or equivalent, on which the 

seat or its underframe is intended to be mounted, is always held essentially horizontal in 
the said plane, comprising a linkage (5) between the mounting plate (4) and a base unit 

(2), said linkage comprising a first link (30) and a second link (31), said links via upper 
and lower joints (33, 37 and 32, 36, respectively) being pivotally connected to the 

mounting plate (4) and to the base unit (2).The distance between the axes of rotation of 
the upper joints (33, 37) is shorter than the distance between the axes of rotation of the 

lower joints (32, 36). The foundation also comprises at least one motive mechanism (6) 
which is operative between one of said links and the base unit (2) for pivoting the links in 

said upper and lower joints in said plane when the tilt of the vehicle in said plane 
changes, the mounting plate being maintained in a horizontal position, whilst being at the 

same time displaced in the same direction as a tilt variation.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a foundation for seats in vehicles, especially in cross-country 
work vehicles, comprising mechanisms for compensating for the tilt of the vehicle cab in 
at least one plane, so that a mounting plate or equivalent, on which the seat or its 
underframe is intended to be mounted, is always held essentially horizontal in the said 
plane, comprising a linkage between the mounting plate and a base unit, said links via 
upper and lower joints being pivotally connected to the mounting plate and to the base 
unit, respectively. The invention relates also to a system for automatic manoeuvring of 
the seat foundation. The driver's cab in cross-country work vehicles is a problematic workplace from the 
ergonomic viewpoint. One of these problems concerns the levelling of the driver's seat if 
the seat is at all equipped with levelling devices. Another problem concerns the stresses 
in the lateral direction to which the driver is exposed when the vehicle pitches. Whilst the 
human body is well equipped to withstand shocks in the vertical direction, the body has 
poor self-defence, in fact, against stresses in the lateral direction. A typical feature of 
systems hitherto proposed for levelling of the driver's seating is that although there has 
been some success in solving the levelling problems themselves, the problems which are 
linked with the said lateral stresses have not be solved. A further typical feature is that 
the driver, by virtue of the levelling motions of the seat foundation, has been displaced 
very much in the lateral direction relative to the driver's cab, so that the field of vision of 
the driver changes very dramatically whilst he is driving. The Swedish patent No. 
367 358 shows a system of this type. Another adverse effect of conventional levelling 
systems is that the vertical position of the driver also changes, thereby also altering the 
field of vision. It is also known in the art, e.g. through the US patent No. 3 632 076, to 
provide a self-leveling seat assembly having rollers and arcuate trac guides securing the 
seat to a support and providing limited movement of the seat relative to the support 
along an arc of circle in response to a tilt of a vehicle cab. A drawback of an assembly of 
this type is that it requires much space in the driver's cabin, and another drawback is that 
the rolling action requires substantial play.  The object of the invention is to provide a seat foundation which, in relation to the prior 
art, is an improvement with regard to the

Foundation for seats in vehicles, comprising mechanisms for compensating for the tilt 
of the vehicle cab in at least one plane, so that a mounting plate or equivalent, on which 

the seat or its underframe is intended to be mounted, is always held essentially horizontal 
in the said plane, comprising a linkage (5) between the mounting plate (4) and a base unit 

(2), said linkage comprising a first link (30) and a second link (31), said links via upper 
and lower joints (33, 37 and 32, 36, respectively) being pivotally connected to the 

mounting plate (4) and to the base unit (2), respectively, characterized in that 
the distance between the axes of rotation ofthe upper joints (33, 37) is shorter than the 

distance between the axes of rotation ofthe lower joints (32, 36) and that the foundation 
also comprises at least one motive mechanism (6) which is operative between one of said 

links and the base unit (2) for pivoting the links in said upper and lower joints in said 
plane when the tilt of the vehicle in said plane changes, the mounting plate being 

maintained in a horizontal position, whilst being at the same time displaced in the same 
direction as a tilt variation. 
Foundation according to claim 1, characterized in that the first link (30) 
stands vertically in the normal position of the linkage, in that the second link (31) is 

equally or at least essentially equally as long as the first link, calculated between the 
centre axes in the rotational joints of the respective links, and in that it tilts inwards 

towards the first link. 
Foundation according to any of claims 1-2, characterized in that the said first 
and second links each comprise at least two mutually parallel link arms (30A, 30B and 

31A, 31B respectively). 
Foundation according to any one of claims 1-3, characterized in that the said 
motive mechanisms comprise, on the one hand, a hydraulic cylinder, which functions 

between the base unit (2) and one of the said first and second links between the upper 

and lower rotational axes of this link, and, on the other hand, spring mechanisms (41V, 
41H), which are arranged to be successively tensioned when the first link (30) is pivoted 

from its vertical normal position by means of the hydraulic cylinder. 
Foundation according to claim 4, characterized in that the said spring 
mechanism comprises two spring elements arranged such that each is tensioned when the 

first link is pivoted in either direction from its normal vertical position. 
Foundation according to any one of claims 4 and 5, characterized in that the 
hydraulic cylinder and the said spring mechanism function between the base unit (2) and 

the said second link (31). 
Foundation according to any one of claims 1-6, characterized in that the base 
unit (2) is rotatable relative to a foundation fastening element (1) about a rotational axis

mechanisms (20) are arranged to connect detachably together the said base unit and the
