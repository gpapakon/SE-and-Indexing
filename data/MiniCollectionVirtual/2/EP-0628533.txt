<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to the recovery of hydroxy acid value from a 
hydroxy acid polymer containing source, such as food container trash. 
Specifically, the invention relates to the recovery of high molecular weight 
poly(hydroxy acid) of at least 10,000 and normally 15,000 to 500,000 MW by at 
least partially depolymerizing and solubilizing the poly(hydroxy acid) in a 
solubilizing fluid. Shaped articles of high molecular weight (at least 10,000, and normally 
15,000 to 500,000 MW) poly(hydroxy acids) (PHAs), particularly poly(lactic 
acid) (polylactide), poly(glycolic acid) (polyglycolide), and copolymers thereof, 
are well known. These polymers slowly hydrolyze and, thereafter, biodegrade to 
environmentally benign products. Consequently, high molecular weight PHA 
polymer shaped articles are replacing poly(styrene) and other non-degradable 
polymers to form products, such as fast food containers, that will degrade in a 
landfill (see, for example, Sinclair, W090/01521). While this is a significant step in minimizing litter and long-term landfill 
disposal, discarding high molecular weight PHA articles has the cost penalty of 
discarding the valuable hydroxy acid (HA). Although the hydrolysis of PHAs is 
well known, heretofore it has not been achievable in a time frame to permit 
recovery and reuse of the hydroxy acid. Further, although high molecular weight 
PHAs are degradable, the time for degradation is so long as not to offer a 
significant lessening of the burden on landfills. Thus, there is a need for an economical method to recover and recycle 
hydroxy acids from trash, both to recover the valuable hydroxy acid and to avoid 
burdening landfills with this waste. The invention is a method for recovering hydroxy acid values from a 
poly(hydroxy acid) containing source, said method comprising, in order: 
(a) contacting the source with a solubilizing fluid in an amount of at least 1 
mole of solubilizing fluid per mole of hydroxy acid equivalent present in  
 
the source, said solubilizing fluid selected from the group consisting of (1) 
water, (2) alcohols containing 1 to 6 carbon atoms, (3) mixtures of water 
and said alcohols, (4) amines of the formula HNR₁R₂, wherein R₁ and 
R₂ are independently selected from the group consisting of hydrogen and 
alkyl groups of 1-4 carbon atoms; (5) liquid media containing diamines of 
the formula H(R₃)NR₅N(R₄)H, wherein R₃ and R₄ are independently 
selected from the group consisting of hydrogen and alkyl groups of 1-4 
carbon atoms or are joined to form a
