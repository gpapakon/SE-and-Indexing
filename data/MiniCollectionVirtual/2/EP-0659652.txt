<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a container with a lid (8) for repeatably containing, transporting and removing liquid coating materials, such as dispersion paints or the like. The container consists of a bearing structure of metal, a protective layer which adheres releasably to the inner surface of the container, is inert relative to the intended contents and can be replaced as required, and an outer coating. The outer coating and the inner coating are different in their thickness and material composition. The bottom of the container consists of various part-sections (6, 7, 2, 3) which slope differently and are connected by welding to one another and to the container walls (1), the outlet valve (10) of the container being arranged outside the container volume, but within the container dimensions.
