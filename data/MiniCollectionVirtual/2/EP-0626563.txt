<ABSTRACT>
A device for measuring absolute position of a part (10) with respect to an optical measuring arrangement (11) containing at least two sensors (22, 23) is proposed, in which the surface of the part (10) is constructed as a hologram scale (18) or in which a hologram scale (18) is applied to the surface (19) of the part (10). The hologram scale (18) contains tracks (S0-Sm, Sm+1-Sn), which are constructed as gratings having in each case a predetermined grating period (d0-dm). Some of the tracks (S0-Sm) can be designed in such a manner that the grating periods (d0-dm) in each case differ by a predetermined amount. Other tracks (Sm+1-Sn) are formed in such a manner that the gratings, which in each case have identical grating periods, contain fields (30 - 34), the starting phase of at least one grating being changed on transition from one field to the other field (30 - 34).
