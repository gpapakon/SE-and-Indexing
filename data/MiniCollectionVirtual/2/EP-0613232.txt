<ABSTRACT>
The flyback-converter switched-mode power supply has a semiconductor switching element (switch) for clocked application of a DC voltage to a first primary winding of a transformer, with a control device for controlling the semiconductor switching element as well as a capacitive device which has a predetermined capacitance and is connected parallel to the load section of the semiconductor switching element. The capacitance of this capacitive device can be altered, at least from a first value, to a second, smaller value, when a voltage drop at the load section of the semiconductor switch element is smaller than the D.C. voltage which should be switched.

Flyback converter switched-mode power supply with 
a semiconductor switching element (T1) which has a load 

section (D, S) and, for the purpose of the clocked 
appliance of a DC voltage (U
C
), is connected to a first 
primary winding (n
p
) of a transformer (TR) by means of 
one terminal of the primary winding (n
p
), at whose other 
terminal the DC voltage (U
C
) can be applied, with a 
control device (IC) for driving the semiconductor switching 

element (T1), and with a capacitive device (C; D*, R*, 
C*) connected in parallel with the load section (D, S) of 

the semiconductor switching element (T1), characterized 
in that the capacitance of the capacitive device (C; D*, 

R*, C*) can be switched to a first, smaller value and a 
second, larger value, in that provision is made of a 

further winding (n
W
), which is coupled to the first 
primary winding (n
p
) and which causes the capacitance of 
the capacity device (C; D*, R*, C*) to be switched from 

the first value to the second value when a voltage (U
D
) 
dropping across the load section (D, S) of the semiconductor 

switching element (T1) is at least approximately 
larger than the DC voltage (U
C

switched from the second to the first value when the 

voltage (U
C
) dropping across the load section (D, S) of 
the semiconductor switching element (T1) is at least 

approximately smaller than the DC voltage (U
C
). 
Flyback converter switched-mode power supply 
according to Claim 1, characterized in that the 

capacitive device (C; D*, R*, C*) is a capacitor (C). 
Flyback converter switched-mode power supply 
according to Claim 1, characterized in that the  

 
capacitive device (C; D*, R*, C*) is a series circuit of 

a capacitor (C*) with a parallel circuit of a diode (D*) 
and a resistor (R*). 
Flyback converter switched-mode power supply 
according to one of Claims 1 to 3, characterized in that 

the capacitive device (C; D*, R*, C*) has at least two 
series-connected capacitors (C, CC), and in that one of 

the capacitors (CC) can be short circuited via a switching 
device (SC) controlled by the further winding (n

another, it being possible to disconnect at least one of 
these capacitors via a second switching device (SC) 

controlled by the further winding (n
