<ABSTRACT>
A decomposition reactor for installation in connection with a thermal decomposition chamber for hydrocarbon gases, especially a plasma torch (2), is designed in the form of a defined, insulated chamber, with an inlet for admixtures/gases in the walls of the reactor space. In order to improve the control of the products produced, the supply channels (4) in the walls of the reactor (1) are provided with channels for introducing hydrocarbon gases of the same kind as the main medium introduced at a temperature of between 1000 and 2000  DEG C in the upper region of the space. Hydrocarbon gas of a lower temperature is introduced at one or more points further down in the reactor. A method for the operation of such a decomposition reactor for the production of carbon black with defined physical properties, is also described.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a method and a decomposition reactor for installation 
in connection with a thermal decomposition chamber for 
hydrocarbon gases, especially a plasma torch, wherein the 
reactor is designed as a defined, insulated chamber with an 
inlet for admixtures/gases through the walls of the reactor 
chamber. In connection with the decomposition of hydrocarbons 
in plasma torches, a method is known for providing reactor 
chambers for further processing of the reaction products or 
decomposition products. Such reactors are known, e.g., for the 
production of acetylene. Reactor chambers have also been used 
in connection with the production of carbon black and hydrogen 
where special temperatures have been set in the reactor in 
order to obtain a special characteristic for the end product. A method is also known for introducing special gases along the 
reactor walls in order to prevent the formation of deposits and 
in order to cool the wall areas. However, in none of these known reactors has a sufficiently 
even quality been achieved in the produced carbon black with 
regard to its structure. This is probably due to the formation 
of various arbitrary temperature zones in the reactor, which 
result in an uncontrolled carbon development and thereby a 
relatively unspecified quality in the final product. By introducing 
gas along the reactor wall in order to prevent the 
formation of deposits, similar side effects have occurred as 
well as the establishment of temperature zones which have had 
a detrimental effect on the products. Without such gases 
problems have very frequently arisen with deposits on the 
reactor walls which have resulted in stoppages for scraping, in 
order to make the reactor operational again. These problems 
have led to reactors generally having been operated intermittently 
with the consequent increase in operational costs.  
 The object of the present invention is to provide a method and a reactor 
which makes it possible to have greater control over the 
products obtained. A further object of the invention is to 
provide a reactor which can be kept in continuous operation and 
where strict control is obtained over the temperature development 
throughout the entire reactor, where it is possible to 
control any admixtures and thereby obtain a product with a 
desired quality and physical properties. These objects are achieved with a method and a decomposition reactor of the 
type described in the introduction which is characterized by 
the features in the patent

<CLAIMS>
A method for the production of carbon black with defined 
physical properties in a decomposition reactor (1), which 

reactor (1) is connected to a plasma torch (2) and is equipped 
with supply channels (4) through the reactor walls,
 
characterized in that in addition to the decomposition products 

(3) from the plasma torch (2) additional hydrocarbon gas and/or 
heating gas is introduced from supply channels (4) through the 

side walls of the reactor (1) at a temperature of between 1000 
and 2000°C in the upper region of the reactor (1), and where 

gas of a lower temperature that 1000°C is introduced at one or 
more points further down in the reactor (1) at increasing 

distance from the plasma torch (2), wherein the supply of 
additional hydrocarbon gas and/or heating gas is controlled in 

order to obtain a predetermined temperature distribution in the 
reactor (1), and with supply of defined quantities of 

hydrocarbon gas through the supply channels (4) for per se 
known decomposition of the supplied gases into carbon and 

hydrogen so that the carbon from the supply channels (4) is 
deposited on the carbon from the plasma torch (2) and develops 

particles having the desired properties.

the supply channels (4). 
An apparatus for carrying out the method of claim 1 for 
the production of carbon comprising a decomposition reactor (1) 

for installation in connection with a thermal decomposition 
chamber in the form of a plasma torch (2), wherein the  

 
reactor (1) is designed in the form of a defined, thermally 

insulated chamber with supply channels (4) for admixtures/gases

of the reactor (1) include channels for introducing hydrocarbon 
gases and/or heating gases, wherein the supply channels (4) are 

equipped with temperature control devices in order to obtain 
the desired temperature zones in the reactor (1) and where the
