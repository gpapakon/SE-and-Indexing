<ABSTRACT>
The invention provides an oxygen scavenger composition 
consisting essentially of

 
[I]
 as essential components,
 

(a) an alkali metal sulfide, and
 

(b) at least one oxidation promoter selected from silica, 
alumina, silica-alumina, silica-magnesia and inorganic materials 

containing one of them as a main ingredient; and
 

[II] as optional components,

 
(c) at least one oxidation promoter aid, and/or

 
(d) a water-insoluble or sparingly water-soluble, inert filler, 

and/or
 

(e) water held physically or chemically in the composition. 
Also provided are a heat-generating composition which 
is an oxygen scavenger capable of scavenging at least 5 ml 

of oxygen per gram of the composition from air at 20°C during 
one hour following the commencement of oxidation of 

the composition and a heat-generating structure comprising 
the heat-generating composition enclosed within a film having 

an oxygen permeability of 0.01 to 50 cc/cm². min. .02 
partial pressure (1 atm.), the surface area of the film being 0.2 

to 10 cm² per gram of said composition. 
The oxygen scavenger compositions can be used to 
capture oxygen from within a closed vessel, while the heat-generating 

compositions can be used to provide a required 
amount of heat to an object to be heated.
