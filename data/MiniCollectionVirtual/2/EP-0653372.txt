<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a compensation 
arrangement in an elevator (1) comprising 

an elevator car (2) and a counterweight 
(3), elevator suspension ropes (11) on 

which the elevator car (2) and the counterweight 
(3) are suspended, a traction 

sheave (5) whose motion is transmitted 
via the suspension ropes (11) to the elevator 

car (2) and to the counterweight 
(3), a car cable (4) and at least one diverting 

pulley (6). The compensation arrangement 
consists of at least one compensation 

loop (7a) for the elevator car 
(2), said loop being suspended from the 

elevator car (2) and a shaft wall, and at 
least one compensation loop (7b) for the 

counterweight (3), said loop being suspended 
from the counterweight (3) and a 

shaft wall. The circulation speed of the 
compensation loop (7b) for the counterweight 

(3) is half the travelling speed 
of the counterweight (3), and the circulation 

speed of the compensation loop 
(7a) for the elevator car (2) is half the 

travelling speed of the elevator car (2). 
The compensation loops (7a,7b) are attached 

to the shaft wall at a point at or 
above the midpoint of the path of the 

elevator car (2) or counterweight (3).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a compensation arrangement 
in an elevator as defined in the preamble of claim 1. In high-rise buildings, elevators need to be provided with 
compensating ropes, belts or chains to offset the unbalance 
moment generated when the car is moving. If this were not 
done, motors of a considerably larger size would have to be 
used and the phenomenon would become worse wish increasing 
height. If the height in the shaft is increased sufficiently 
without rope compensation, a situation will occur where the 
friction is insufficient. In these, the compensation rope is 
fastened via a fixed wheel to the bottom of the shaft. There are two different types of rope compensation. In the 
first type, a rope, belt or chain can be used, and these can 
be lined with rubber or plastic and they often contain additional 
masses attached to them. These ropes, belts or chains 
are mounted as loops below and between the car and counterweight 
and they are preferably attached to the lower parts of 
the car and counterweight. The range of application of this 
rope compensation is limited to relatively low speeds because 
of the danger of swinging. At the culmination of the loop, 
the speed of the rope, belt or chain is the same as that of 
the elevator. This speed occurring at the culmination point 
of the loop is called the loop circulation speed. Now, if the 
speed of the elevator is changed during acceleration or 
deceleration, then the speed of the loop will be changed as 
well and the cable starts to swing. The larger the speed 
range, the greater is the danger that the swinging will 
result in the rope, belt or chain being caught on a piece of 
shaft equipment. In the other type of compensation, the additional masses used 
are generally a rope or ropes hanging in the form of loops 
below and between the car and counterweight. In addition, 
these loops are tightened by means of a tensioning device.  In this other type, swinging is prevented by using a guided 
tension weight. An example of known technology is e.g. the 
solution presented in US patent 3,653,467. Its drawbacks 
include a high cost and a complex structure. The solution of the invention eliminates these drawbacks by 
rendering the expensive tension weight unnecessary and 
halving the loop speed as compared to the old loop. This is 
achieved by suspending the compensating ropes so that they 
run from the underside of the elevator car to fixing points 
in the wall and, similarly, from the underside of the counterweight 
to fixing
