<ABSTRACT>
A field test apparatus and method is disclosed in 
which gradual movement of the head supporting chin cup is used 

to maintain a centered relation between the eye being tested 
and the trial lens frame holding the required prescription for 

optimum vision of the patient. During the test, alternating 
illumination is provided in the infrared between a central 

corneal reflection and an iris illuminating source which 
imparts a high contrast bright circular iris image surrounding 

a central dark pupil. Content addressable memories are used 
to delineate areas of contrast change for rapid and 

abbreviated microprocessor analysis of conventional RAM 
images. Both the corneal reflection image -- which is a 

brightly illuminated spot on an otherwise dark background --and 
the pupillary image -- which is a dark pupil surrounded by 

a brightly illuminated high contrast image of the iris are 
approximately located at their boundaries using content 

addressable memory. Thereafter, conventionally stored video 

data is processed at locations restricted to the high contrast 
boundaries. For location of the pupil center, special 

techniques are disclosed for examining the image's first and 
second derivatives to establish the pupil center within sub-pixel 

limits. These methods include sufficient data 
processing speed improvements to enable a time shared use of a 

microprocessor having gaze angle measurement as a peripheral 
event to instrument control, and data collection required in 

such field testing.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a field analyzer for
testing the optical perception of the retina of the human eye.
The disclosed method and apparatus includes a moveable chin
cup to maintain eye centration on any test frame utilized
during the test and includes techniques for rapidly computing
gaze direction, including the use of content addressable
memories.In Lehmer et al. U.S. Patent 5,220,361 issued June
15, 1993 entitled Gaze Tracking for Field Analyzer, the
inventors herein disclose a method and apparatus for tracking
the gaze angle of the human eye during a so-called "field
test."A field analyzer is a device for surveying the
sensitivity of a patient's retina. A spot of light, termed a
point, is projected to a hemispherical projection screen for a
short period of time. A patient viewing the hemispherical
projection screen from the center of the sphere fixates along
a line of sight to a fixation light source mounted on the
surface of the bowl. The point of projection on the
hemispherical projection screen controllably changes to
positions spaced apart from the fixation light source.
Preferably, the point is varied in intensity as the point
moves from position to position on the hemispherical
projection screen. A subjective determination is made by the
patient by depressing a response button Fig. 1A item 30, if
the point is seen. By positioning the point to known
locations on the hemispherical projection screen and changing
the brightness (in a total amount of about four decades), the
sensitivity of the patient's retina is measured and mapped.This simple concept has two basic optical problems
interfacing to the patient. First, the patient must fixate on
the center of the hemispheric projection screen. This 
fixation must be maintained when the point is presented,
usually to the side of the patient's fixated line of sight, if
the point is to fall on a consistent part of the retina.
Secondly, the patient's vision usually must be properly
corrected to focus the surface of the hemispherical projection
screen onto the retina.It will be understood focus is particularly critical
when the sensitivity of the retina is measured at the
threshold of the patient's vision perception; were the
patient's focus not correct, targets that should be seen are
not detected and give erroneous results. This is due to the
fact that an unfocused spot of light appears dimmer than a
focused one.The patient's eyeglasses are almost always
unsuitable for providing a focused view of the points on the
hemispherical projection screen

A method of processing a video image information of an image from the pupil (60)
of the human eye (E) including a corneal reflection (140) of a light source (130) and

an image of said pupil (60) comprising the steps of:

providing a read and write memory addressable by row and column for
receiving the intensity of said image of the human eye at said row and column

location;
