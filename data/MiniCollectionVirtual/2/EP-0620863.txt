<ABSTRACT>
A method of effecting a manipulation of a nucleic acid sequence comprises (a) providing a solid support system having bonded thereto a single stranded oligonucleotide complementary to a specific sequence on a target nucleic acid longer than said oligonucleotide, (b) adding a source of single stranded target nucleic acid to the solid support system, (c) hybridising the target nucleic acid to the oligonucleotide, and (d) effecting the manipulation on the hybridised target nucleic acid. The manipulation may for example be a copying or amplification of the target nucleic acid sequence. In a preferred embodiment, the support is provided in a flow-through vessel which facilitates washing of the support to remove impurities and leave a "clean" sample of target nucleic acid on which the manipulation may be carried out. The support preferably has a siloxane matrix to which the oligonucleotide is bound. This provides a stable linkage between the oligonucleotide and the support. The method is particularly useful for analysis of medical samples.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method and apparatus for
carrying out manipulations on nucleic acid sequences using a solid
support system, as well as to supports for use in the method and
apparatus.Various procedures are known for manipulating nucleic acid
sequences. For example, EP-A-0 200 362 (Cetus) describes a liquid
phase process for amplifying, detecting and/or cloning nucleic acid
sequences. The process comprises the following steps
(i) treating separate complementary strands of the nucleic
acid sequence with two oligonucleotide primers each of
which hybridises to one of the strands;(ii) extending the primers to form double stranded nucleic acid
sequences;(iii) denaturing the product from (ii) to produce single strands
of nucleic acid; and(iv) using the single strands from (iii) in repeat of steps (i)-(iii)
the overall procedure being repeated as often as
necessary.It is a feature of this prior technique that both complementary
strands are used as templates for the second and further amplification
steps. Furthermore in the method of EP-A-0 200 362 the reactant
mixture includes unhybridised target nucleic acid, unhybridised copy
target, and unhybridised primer which makes the system very
inefficient. Additionally any mistake which occurs in the copying at
any stage results in the mistake being copied into the "chain
reaction".Amplification techniques using solid phase support systems are
also known, for example DYNAL (Trade Mark) magnetic beads as
disclosed in EP-A-0 091 453 and EP-A-0 106 873. In use of such beads,
DNA is synthesised onto a magnetic bead and then cleaved therefrom
by ammonium hydroxide. The beads may then be separated from the 
synthesised DNA using a magnet. Alternatively, biotin may be added
to one end of a synthesised or natural DNA sequence and the sequence
recovered using a magnetic bead which has been pre-conjugated to
streptavidin (thereby attracting the biotin to recover the DNA). A
problem with this type of solid support is that the biotin streptavidin
linkage is biodegradable.Other known solid support systems include porous silicas. The
presence of the pores can create problems since nucleotide chain
growth occurs within the pores, resulting in inefficient washing and
residues remaining within the pores, again reducing the yield and
resulting in relatively inefficient coupling.EP-A-0 184 056 describes a method for the large scale production
of DNA probes using a solid substrate. The process of this prior
specification comprises covalently linking to a solid
