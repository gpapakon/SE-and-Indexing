<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates generally to a polymer membrane type ion-selective
electrode, and more particularly, to a polymer membrane type ion-selective
electrode suitable for monitoring polyionic macromolecules such as heparin.Polymer membrane type ion-selective electrodes are now routinely used in
commercial biomedical instruments to measure accurately levels of clinical important
small ions, such as Ca++, Na+, K+, Li+, H+, and Cl-, in undiluted whole blood.
These ion-selective electrodes typically comprise a highly plasticized polymeric
matrix material with an ion-exchange material or ion-complexing agent therein. The
ion-exchange material may be a quaternary ammonium salt, such as tridodecyl -
methyl ammonium chloride (TDMAC).Polyvinyl chloride (PVC) is a common polymeric membrane matrix material
used in the art of solid-state or liquid-membrane electrodes for the detection of small
ions (see, for example, U.S. Patent No. 4,861,455 or Hartman, et al., "Chloride-Selective
Liquid-Membrane Electrodes Based on Lipophilic Methyl-Tri-N-Alkyl-Ammonium
Compounds and Their Applicability to Blood Serum Measurements,"
Mikrochimica Acta [Wein], 1978 II 235-246).Efforts to develop similar sensors, including immuno-based biosensors, for
the detection of large biomolecules, such as proteins or drugs, have thus far been
unsuccessful. One of the most difficult problems has been identifying appropriate
complexing agents and membrane chemistries that yield significant, specific and
reversible electrochemical responses to the desired analyte. Even if a specific
complexing agent is identified for a macromolecular biomolecule, whether the
interaction with the macromolecular ion is strong enough to overcome the rather low
mobility of a large ion to yield to significant electrochemical response remains in
question. In theory, the sensitivity and selectivity of an ion-selective electrode
membranes is governed by both the mobility of the analyte ion and the strength of
the interaction between the ion-complexing agent and the analyte ion. In addition, 
strong interference resulting from a high concentration of small ions, such as
chloride ions, in a blood sample may dictate the membrane's response.An analyte of particular clinical significance is heparin, a polyanionic
macromolecule. Heparin is the anticoagulant drug used universally in surgical
procedures and extracorporeal therapies, and for the prevention of thromboembolism
following surgery or childbirth. Heparin is a group of polydisperse (molecular
weight ranges from 5,000
