<ABSTRACT>
A recording and/or reproducing apparatus for a disc-shaped recording medium (1) 
includes an optical head (3), a disc rotationally driving unit (2), a transfer unit (11), and 

an eccentricity amount measuring unit. The optical head (3) irradiates an light beam 
onto the disc-shaped recording medium (1). The disc rotationally driving unit (2) is 

equipped with the disc-shaped recording medium (1), and rotationally drives the disc-shaped 
recording medium equipped. The transfer unit (11) transfers the optical head 

and the disc rotationally driver relatively in the radial direction of the disc-shaped 
recording medium. The eccentricity amount measuring unit includes an error signal 

generator (4) and a controller (8, 12). The error signal generator (4) generates an error 
signal exhibiting the amount of relative displacement of a spot of a light beam irradiated 

from the optical head, which is generated on the basis of an output signal from the 
optical head, onto the disc-shaped recording medium with respect to a track on the disc-shaped 

recording medium. The controller detects (8, 12) the peak and trough values of 
the error signal supplied from the error signal generator and compares a difference 

signal exhibiting a difference between the peak and trough valued detected with a 

reference value to calculate the amount of eccentricity of the disc-shaped 
recording 

medium on the basis of a comparison output signal and to generate a drive signal to be 
supplied to the transfer unit. The transfer unit (11) transfers the optical head and the 

disc rotationally driving unit in a radial direction of the disc-shaped recording medium 
by supplying the drive signal from the controller (8, 12) to the transfer unit (11).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a disc-shaped
recording medium eccentricity measuring apparatus and a method
thereof, and an apparatus for recording and/or reproducing the
disc-shaped recording medium. More particularly, the invention
relates to a disc-shaped recording medium eccentricity
measuring apparatus for measuring the disc-shaped recording
medium on the basis of a tracking error signal and a method
thereof, and an apparatus for recording and/or reproducing the
disc-shaped recording medium, which is equipped with the
eccentricity measuring apparatus.Disc recording or reproducing apparatus are equipped
with actuators for driving objective lenses for optical heads
in accordance with a tracking error signal obtained from track
guide information such as rows of pits or grooves for
controlling the optical spot tracking. The apparatus also
include a sled mechanism for displacing the relative position
of the whole of the optical head and the disc surface with
respect to the direction of the diameter of the disc. Methods for the sled mechanism where the whole of the
optical head is shifted with respect to the disc, and where a
turntable on which the disc is mounted is shifted with respect
to a fixed position of the optical head are well known.There is also a method where a sled error signal is
generated by extracting the low frequency component from the
tracking error signal by passing it through a low pass filter,
amplifying it, and then applying it to a drive motor as a drive
signal. The sled error signal is a signal exhibiting the
amount of the offset between the whole of the optical head and
the objective lens for which the actuator within the optical
head drives the tracking.FIGS. 1a to 1c show the waveforms of those signals.
Fig. 1c is the tracking error signal which is supplied to a low
pass filter to generate the sled error signal shown in Fig. 1b.
The sled drive signal shown in Fig. 1a is then obtained.The sled error signal in Fig. 1b exhibits the angle of
radiation of a light beam applied from the optical head with
respect to a disc surface. The sled mechanism should therefore
carry out shifting in such a direction that the angle of
radiation is vertical and the sled error signal becomes zero.However, even if the sled drive signal is applied to
the sled motor, a point at which the shift of the optical head
commences depends on the stationary coefficient of friction of
the sled mechanism. As the stationary coefficient of friction
disperses depending on the apparatus in accordance with the 
sled
