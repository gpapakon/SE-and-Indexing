<ABSTRACT>
A dot matrix printer head comprises an ink supply tank (2) 
provided with an ink supply port (41), the ink supply tank 

(2) containing ink absorbing means (60'',61,62) from which ink 
may pass to the ink supply port (41). The ink supply tank 

(2) has an air hold (42) therein which communicates with air 
in at least one space (50b) between the ink absorbing means 

(60'',61,62) and a wall (5) of the ink supply tank (2). The 
ink absorbing means has pores which are progressively reduced 

in size in a direction towards an ink supply port (41) of the 
ink supply tank (2'').

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an ink tank for
supplying a proper amount of ink needed to a printer
head.Ink tanks which comprise a bottom wall, a top wall, walls
extending between the top and bottom walls, an ink supply
port, an ink supply section filled
with an ink absorbing member of a porous material
impregnated with ink, and being formed as an integral
unit detachably mountable to a print head are known e.g.
from JP-A-57 100 088 and EP-A-0 041 777.However, in all prior art documents space for obtaining
and storing ink is completely filled with ink. Only in
case of a maximum filling of the space the optimum amount
of ink needed is provided. In case of less filling of the
space the amount of ink supply may vary.US-A-4 095 237 also discloses an ink reservoir comprising
a porous filler and an air hole. Though it is mentioned
that the filler may only partially fill the reservoir US-A-4
095 237 does not teach how to arrange this filter
only partially filling this reservoir. It is therefore an object of the present invention
to provide a high-quality and highly reliable ink tank
of a simple construction which is capable
of supplying a stable and appropriate quantity of ink
and is less subjected to the influence of
environmental changes such as temperature variations
than prior constructions. Therefore, according to the present invention, there is
provided an ink tank according to independent claim 1.
Further advantageous features of the ink tank are evident
from the dependent claims. The ink tank according to the
invention is suited for supplying a proper amount of ink
needed to a dot matrix printer head without either an
excess or shortage of ink. The ink tank is, furthermore,
detachable and comprises a top wall, a rectangular bottom
wall and walls extending between them defining the
interior of the tank, an ink supply port for delivering
ink, and an ink absorbing means in the tank interior and
from which ink may pass to the ink supply port. The ink
absorbing means has pores being progressively reduced in
size in a direction towards the ink supply port. The ink
supply port is located in the bottom wall close to one
narrow side of the bottom wall. Furthermore, the ink tank
comprises an air hole which is provided in a wall of the
tank and communicates the exterior of the tank with air
in a space formed between the ink absorbing means and the
top wall of the ink tank such that the ink absorbing
means is at a distance from an inner surface of the top
wall of the ink tank. The ink supply tank may have at

<CLAIMS>
An ink tank (2) for supplying a proper amount of ink needed
to a dot matrix printer head without either an excess or

shortage of ink, said ink tank (2) being detachable and
comprising a top wall (50), a rectangular bottom wall (40a)

and walls extending between them defining the interior of
the tank, an ink supply port (41) for delivering ink, and

an ink absorbing means (60''; 61, 62) in the tank interior
and from which ink may pass to the ink supply port (41),

which ink absorbing means has pores being progressively
reduced in size in a direction towards the ink supply port

(41), wherein

the ink supply port (41) is located in the bottom wall
(40a) close to one narrow side of the bottom wall (40a),
and the ink tank comprises an air hole (42) which is
provided in a wall of the tank and communicates the

exterior of the tank with air in a space (50b) formed
between the ink absorbing means (60"; 61, 62) and the top

wall (50) of the ink tank (2) such that the ink absorbing
means (60", 61, 62) is at a distance from an inner surface

of the top wall (50) of the ink tank.
An ink tank as claimed in claim 1, characterized in that
ridges (51) of the inner surface of the top wall (50)

contact the ink absorbing means (60"; 61, 62) so that the
remaining portion of the top wall (50) is at a distance

from the ink absorbing means (60''; 61, 62). 
An ink tank as claimed in claim 2, characterized in that
the ink tank (2) has a plurality of inner wall surfaces

(40a, 40c, 50a) having a projecting portion, ridges or a
partition wall which maintain the ink absorbing means

(60''; 61, 62) at a distance from the walls (44, 47, 48).
An ink tank as claimed in any one of the preceding claims,
characterized in that the ink absorbing means (60") is

compressed in the vicinity of the said ink supply port
(41).
