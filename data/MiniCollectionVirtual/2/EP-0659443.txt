<ABSTRACT>
An artificial internal organ, such as an artificial 
heart, comprising a pump unit (4) through which blood 

circulates and a drive shaft (10) for driving the pump 
unit, the drive shaft having a shaft sealing system (22, 

27) thereon. The shaft sealing system is supplied with 
a sealing solution from a sealing solution chamber (21) 

and a sealing solution bag (12). The sealing solution 
is formed mainly of a physiological saline, which is 

loaded with a protease or several kinds of aminopeptides. 
When blood gets into the shaft sealing system 

(22, 27), it is prevented from coagulating by these 
admixtures. Although blood in the shaft sealing system 

(22, 27) of this type coagulates in a unique mechanism 
different from a conventional one, the protease and the 

aminopeptides never lose their effects even in such a 
unique situation.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a sealing system
for preventing blood from coagulating on moving parts in
an artificial internal organ, such as an artificial
heart or pump-oxygenator, in which blood is circulated
and which is provided with a mechanical sealing system
such as a shaft sealing system.More specifically, the present invention relates to
a sealing system in which a sealing solution is fed at a
minute flow rate to that portion of the system which is
in contact with blood, thereby preventing coagulation of
blood in the system, the sealing solution being loaded
with a substance capable of preventing the blood coagulation.An artificial internal organ, such as an artificial
heart, comprises a pump system for feeding blood and a
drive system for driving the pump system. If the pump
system is of an axial-flow type or centrifugal type, its
propeller or impeller is rotated by means of a motor or
the like through the drive shaft. In this arrangement,
the drive shaft is provided with a sealing system for
liquid-tight sealing, and is touched by blood.Thus, blood gets into a space between moving parts
of the shaft sealing system, and then coagulates
therein. In some cases, therefore, the sealing system
may suffer malfunction due to cohesion or the like,
possibly stopping the rotating of the drive shaft. In some conventional shaft sealing systems of this
type, a sealing solution chamber is defined on one side,
and is continually filled with a sealing solution so
that blood can be prevented from getting into the system
by the sealing solution. In general, a physiological
saline is used as the sealing solution.Even in this case, however, blood cannot be
securely prevented from getting into the shaft sealing
system. It is necessary, therefore, to provide means
for preventing blood from coagulating in the system.
These circumstances and requirements are common to pump-oxygenators
and other artificial internal organs in
which blood is circulated and which are provided with
a mechanical sealing system, as well as artificial
hearts.In one such means for preventing blood coagulation
in the sealing system, the sealing solution in the
system is loaded with an anticoagulant such as heparin.
This means cannot, however, produce any positive effect,
since the anticoagulant action of heparin causes
antithrombin III to suppress the activity of thrombin,
thereby preventing fibrinogen in blood from changing
into fibrin. However, blood in the shaft sealing system
of this type, e.g., in a narrow gap between rotating
and
