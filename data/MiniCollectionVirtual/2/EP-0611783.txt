<ABSTRACT>
The present invention relates to copolymers of certain siloxy silanes and alkyl 
(meth)acrylate. Especially preferred is the embodiment wherein the silyloxy silane is 

3-methacryloxypropyl-tris(trimethylsilyloxy)-silane and the alkyl (meth)acrylate is 
2-ethylhexyl acrylate. It further relates to pressure sensitive adhesives, especially medical 

adhesives, suitable for use in transdermal therapeutic systems (TTS).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to the use as a medical adhesive of copolymers of certain siloxy silanes and
alkyl (meth)acrylates. It further relates to pressure sensitive adhesives, especially medical
adhesives. In addition, the invention further relates to transdermal and transmucosal drug
delivery products and the pressure sensitive medical adhesives used therein.Pressure sensitive adhesives (PSA) have been widely used in various fields for holding,
protecting, sealing, and masking purposes. One application to the medical field is to the
area of transdermal therapeutic systems (TTS). In the context of this specification, unless
specified otherwise, the term "transdermal" will refer collectively to transdermal and
transmucosal and the term "skin" will refer respectively to skin or mucosa depending on
whether a transdermal or transmucosal therapeutic system is under consideration. In
addition to the general requirements for PSAs for general use, TTS require that PSAs be
nonirritating to the skin, be physically and chemically compatible with the drug(s) being
administered, and be moisture resistant. PSAs must also adhere well to the skin, provide
intimate contact of the TTS with the skin surface during application, and leave no residue
upon removal.PSAs that have been used in TTS are, among others, polyacrylates and polydimethylsiloxanes.
For example, alkyl acrylates are tacky and pressure-sensitive and, therefore, do
not require the addition of tackifying agents or plasticizers. Polydimethylsiloxanes
(silicones) have been considered biocompatible and oxygen permeable. It is apparent that
a PSA composed of acrylic and organic silicone types of polymers and retaining
advantageous properties of each is desirable for use in TTS.It has been known that a PSA should have a balance of cohesive and adhesive strength.
Such a balance has been attempted by incorporating two or more components with
different properties by blending polymers or in some instances by copolymerization.
Polyalkyl acrylates, especially polyethylhexyl acrylate, are generally known as tacky, low 
glass transition temperature polymers. By incorporating a component with a higher glass
transition temperature and higher cohesive strength, an improvement of properties suitable
for exploitation in a TTS is expected.It is an object of the invention to provide a pressure sensitive adhesive suitable for
use in medical practice, especially in transdermal and transmucosal drug delivery systems.Surprisingly, these and other objects of the invention are
