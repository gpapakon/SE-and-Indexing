<ABSTRACT>
Methods of removing and detecting harmful 
components selected from the group consisting of 

volatile inorganic hydrides, volatile inorganic halides 
and organometallic compounds, and apparatus therefor. 

The harmful components are removed by contacting 
the same with copper hydroxide (24) or are detected 

by observing the discoloration of the hydroxide (24).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method of removing
harmful components selected from the group consisting of
volatile inorganic hydrides, volatile inorganic halides and
organometallic compounds contained in a gas and to a method of detecting the
same, more particularly to a method of removing such
harmful components contained in gases exhausted during the
process of semiconductor manufacturing etc. and a method of
detecting the same.In the manufacture of semiconductors, material gases
containing noxious gas components selected from the group
consisting of volatile inorganic hydrides, volatile
inorganic halides and organometallic compounds are used.
Accordingly, the gases exhausted during the process of
semiconductor manufacturing contain unused material gases
as residues. Since these material gases, which have
toxicity and flammability, are dangerous and harmful
components, the harmful components contained in the exhaust
gases must be removed before they are released into the
atmosphere.Referring to the treatment of removing such harmful
components, the conventional wet treatment method using a
scrubber and the like is recently being replaced by the dry
treatment method. For example, Japanese Patent Publication Nos. Hei 3-64166
and Hei 3-64167 disclose methods of removing arsenic by
bringing arsenic-containing gases into contact with
sorbents containing copper oxides as active ingredients.
Japanese Patent Publication No. Hei 4-17082 discloses a
method of removing a gaseous silicon compound by bringing a
gas containing a gaseous silicon compound into contact with
a sorbent containing a copper oxide or a mixture of a
copper oxide and a zinc oxide as an active ingredient.
Japanese Pateut Publication No. Hei 4-57368 discloses a
method of removing one or more harmful components contained
in a gas, selected from arsine, phosphine, diborane and
hydrogen selenide, into contact with a sorbent containing a
mixture of a copper oxide and silicon oxide and/or aluminum
oxide; and a method of removing a harmful component by
bringing a gas containing diborane and/or hydrogen selenide
as harmful components into contact with a sorbent
containing a mixture of a copper oxide and a zinc oxide as
an active ingredient. Japanese Patent Publication No. Hei
4-19886 discloses a method of removing a silane gas by
bringing a gas containing a silane gas into contact with a
sorbent containing a metal oxide as an active ingredient.When various kinds of harmful components are to be removed
using various types of sorbents as described

a harmful component selected from the group consisting of volatile

inorganic hydrides, volatile inorganic halides and organometallic
compounds contained in the gas into contact with a copper hydroxide used alone or as carried

on a carrier selected from the group consisting of alumina, silica and diatomaceous
earth, so as to remove said harmful component.
The method of removing harmful components according to Claim 1,
wherein said harmful component is brought into contact with said copper

hydroxide and then with a metal oxide selected from the group consisting
of cuprous oxide, cupric oxide, magnesium oxide, calcium oxide, titanium

dioxide, chromium oxide, manganese dioxide, ferrous oxide, nickel oxide,
zinc oxide, aluminium oxide, silver oxide and silicon dioxide so as to

remove said harmful component.
The method of removing harmful components according to Claim 1,
wherein said harmful component is brought into contact with said copper

hydroxide and then with a dehydrating agent so as to remove the water
content, followed by contact with a metal oxide selected from the group

consisting of cuprous oxide, cupric oxide, magnesium oxide, calcium oxide,
titanium dioxide, chromium oxide, manganese dioxide, ferrous oxide,

nickel oxide, zinc oxide, aluminium oxide, silver oxide and silicon dioxide
