<ABSTRACT>
Within a handle (10), an inner pipe (42) extends from a connection nipple (14) as far as a shut-off valve (18). Said pipe (42) is enclosed by an elastomeric hose (44) and exhibits spaced-apart openings (46) into the interior of the hose (44). Rapid closure of the shut-off valve (18), which can be opened by hand counter to the force of a spring (30), causes a temporary superatmospheric pressure due to the excessively rapidly decelerated water column of the supplied water. In order to avoid a pressure surge in the supply line (38) and the accompanying disadvantages thereof, use is made of the inner pipe (42) with the hose (44) which is pushed over said inner pipe and temporarily expands, as a compliant wall, into a cavity (48).

<CLAIMS>
Spray with a tubular handle (10) which bears, at 
its inlet end (12), connection means (14) for a feed line 

(38) and, at its outlet end (16), a spray head (20) and 
a shut-off member (18), which shut-off member (18) is 

fitted on or in the handle (10) and can be actuated, by 
means of a hand lever (24), counter to the force of a 

restoring spring (30) intended for closure purposes, 
characterized in that the connection means (14) are flow-connected 

to the shut-off member (18) by an inner tube 
(42) which defines the flow path, extends coaxially 

within the handle (10), has a hose (44, 44') slipped over 
it, said hose being sealed at both ends, forming a 

pliable wall for the temporary increase in volume and 
being prestressed in the direction of volume reduction, 

and has openings (46) directed into the interior of the 
hose (44, 44'), and in that a cavity (48, 48') which 

encloses the hose (44, 44') is formed between said hose 
and the handle (10). 
Spray according to Claim 1, characterized in that 
the hose (44, 44') consists of an elastomeric material. 
Spray according to Claim 1 or 2, characterized in 
that the cavity (48) is under positive pressure. 
Spray according to Claim 3, characterized in that 
the positive pressure in the cavity (48) is greater than 

the operational static water pressure, but smaller than 
the pressure peaks which are to be expected. 
Spray according to Claim 3 or 4, characterized in 
that there is arranged in the handle (10) a non-return 

member (50) which opens into the cavity (48) from the  
 

outside of said handle and is equipped for the attachment 
of a compressed-air store in order to produce a positive 

pressure in the cavity (48). 
Spray according to Claim 2, characterized in that 
the strength and/or wall thickness of the elastomeric 

hose (44') is or are such that the hose is expanded or 
displaced from the inner tube (42) into the cavity (48') 

by the operational static water pressure and, when the 
shut-off member (18) is opened, at least virtually 

returns into its cylindrical rest position on account of 
the lowering pressure as medium flows through. 
Spray according to one of Claims 1 to 6, 
characterized in that the inner tube (42) extends 

essentially over the entire length of the handle (10), 
and the openings (46) are distributed over its 

circumference and over its length.
