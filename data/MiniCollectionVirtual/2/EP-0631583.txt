<DESCRIPTION>
 Ant1v1 ral phosphonic add derivatives of purl ne analoguesThe present invention relates to novel compounds which are of potential use as antiviral agents, to processes for their preparation and to their use as pharmaceuticals.EP-A-319228 and EP-A-353955 (Beecham Group p.Lc.) disclose a group of purine derivatives containing a 9-[2-(phosphonomethoxy)alkoxy] substituent, which are described as having antiviral activity.EP-A-206459 (Ceskoslovenska akademie ved) discloses a group of 9-(phosphonomethoxyalkyl)adenines, which are described as having antiviral activity.'Nucleotide Analogues as Antiviral Agents' ACS Symposium Series 401, Editor J.C. Martin, published by the American Chemical Society, Washington DC (1989) Chapters 4 and 5 discloses, a number of (phosphonomethoxyalkyl) derivatives of purines and pyrimidines and their antiviral activity.Particular compounds of interest are adenine or guanine having a 9-substituent as follows:(HO)2POCH2OCH2CH2θ- Ex.1, EP-A-319228(HO)2POCH2OCH2CH(CH2θH)O- £x.l6, EP-A-206459(HO)2POCH2θCH2CH2- PMEA/PMEG(HO)2POCH2θCH(CH2θH)CH2- HPMPA HPMPGIt has now been discovered that certain derivatives of these compounds are prodrugs therefor, having improved gastrointestinal absorption properties. 
Accordingly, the present invention provides a compound of formula (I), or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof:(DwhereinX is -CH2O, -CH2 or -CH(CH2OR6)O where R is hydrogen or acyl;Yis O or S; Rj is hydroxy or amino;R2 is amino or hydrogen;R3 is hydrogen or, when X is CH2O and Y is O, R3 may be CH2OR7 where R7 is hydrogen or acyl; andR4 and R5 are both phenyl, 4-bromophenyl, 4-methylphenyl, 4-methoxyphenyl, 2- acetoxyphenyl or 2-methylphenyl.When Ri is hydroxy and R2 is amino, the compound of formula (I) is a guanine derivative;When R is amino and R2 is hydrogen, the compound of formula (I) is an adenine derivative;When Ri is hydroxy and R is hydrogen, the compound of formula (I) is a hypoxanthine derivative; andWhen Ri and R2 are both amino groups, the compound of formula (I) is a 2,6-diaminopurine derivative.Often, the compound of formula (I) is a guanine or adenine derivative.R4 and R5 are preferably both phenyl. 

Suitable examples of R5 R7 when acyl include carboxylic acyl, such as C1-.7 alkanoyl and benzoyl optionally substituted in the phenyl ring by one, two or three groups or atoms selected from halogen, such as fluoro, chloro, bromo, and C1.4 alkyl or Cj_4 alkoxy wherein the alkyl moiety is selected from methyl, ethyl, n- and iso-propyl, n-, sec-, iso- and rerf-butyl.
