<ABSTRACT>
Vehicle steering column energy absorbing device including:   - a support (1) linked to the bodywork and accommodating the tube-body (10),   - a system for immobilising the tube-body (10) in the support (1), - at least one articulation for articulating the tube-body (10) to the support (1), the said articulation being integral with the tube-body (10), - at least one deformation element (3) integral with the support (1) and connected to the articulation articulating the tube-body (10) to the support (1), - at least one element for connection between the tube-body (10) and the deformation element, - so that in the event of an impact, the tube-body (10) carries the deformation element (3) along so as to absorb the energy.

Automobile vehicle steering column comprising :

a steering shaft mounted in a body-tube (10),
a support (1) connected to the vehicle body and receiving the
body-tube (10),
a system for locking (4, 6-8) the body-tube (10) in the support
(1), having a locking axis (4) perpendicular to the steering

column axis and liable to free the body-tube (10) in the event
of an impact,
the body-tube (10) having passages (14) traversed by the
locking system (4, 6-8),
one deformation element rigidly locked with the support (1),
connected to the body-tube (10) and liable to become

deformed and to absorbe at least one part of the energy
received by the body-tube (10) in the event of an impact,

characterized in that each of the passages (14) in the body-tube (10) is
provided with a release (15) directed in the direction of the driver steering

wheel, so as to allow said body-tube (10) to free itself from the locking
system (4, 6-8) in the event of an impact.
The steering column of claim 1, characterized in that the
body-tube (10) is provided with two side vertical members (11, 12)

allowing the locking of the body-tube (10) with respect to the support (1) by
adherence by means of the locking system (4, 6-8), each of said vertical

members (11, 12) comprising one of the passages (14) at a first end (20) of
said a vertical member (11, 12) on the side which is opposed to the driver

steering wheel and the support (1) being connected to a second end (21) of
said vertical member (11, 12) on the driver steering wheel at the level of the

deformation element.
The steering column according to any of claims 1 or 2,
characterized in that the support (1) comprises two vertical members (31,

32) which are plane and parallel with the axis of the steering shaft, each of 
said vertical members (31, 32) comprising a fixing hole (29) through which

said vertical members are fixed to the body-tube (10) along an axis (XX'),
the deformation element being constituted by one zone of said vertical

members (31, 32) in the vicinity of the fixing holes (29).
The steering column of claim 3, characterized in that the
deformation element comprises a crescent-shaped cut-out (33) directed

substantially in the direction of the axis perpendicular to the locking axis
and crossing the fixing hole (29) of one of the two vertical members (31,

32) of the support (1) and the locking axis (4).
The steering column of claim 3, characterized in that the
deformation element comprises a U-shaped cut-out (34) directed

approximately perpendicular to the axis perpendicular to the locking axis
and crossing the fixing hole (29) of one of the two vertical members (31,

32) of the support (1) and the locking axis (4).
The steering column of claim 3, characterized in that the
deformation element comprises a cut-out in the form of two herring bones

(35) arranged either side of the fixing hole (29) and which are directed in
the direction of the axis perpendicular to the locking axis and crossing the

fixing hole (29) of one of the two vertical members (31, 32) of the support
(1) and the locking axis (4).
The steering column of claim 3, characterized in that the
deformation element comprises a cut-out in the form of two elongated holes

(36) arranged either side of each fixing hole (29), substantially
perpendicular to the axis perpendicular to the locking axis and crossing the

fixing hole (29) of one of the two vertical members (31, 32) of the support
(1) and the locking axis (4).
The steering column of claim 3, characterized in that the
deformation element comprises a cut-out (37) in the form of an elongated

hole arranged in the direction of the axis perpendicular to the locking axis
and crossing the fixing hole (29) of one of the two vertical members (31, 

32) of the support (1) and the locking axis (4) and leading into the fixing
hole (29).
The steering column of claim 3, characterized in that the
deformation element comprises a folded-back portion (38) of each vertical

member (31, 32) of the support (1) which comprises the fixing hole (29)
and which covers a notch (39) arranged in the direction of the axis

perpendicular to the locking axis and crossing the fixing hole (29) of one of
the two vertical members (31, 32) of the support (1) and the locking axis
