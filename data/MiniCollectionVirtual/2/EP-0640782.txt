<ABSTRACT>
The gasket comprises a reinforced graphite element (10) 
preferably comprising two or more layers coupled together with 

sandwiched armors, sandwiched between two stainless steel plates 
(24, 26), which preferably have two corrugations or ridges (32, 

34) extending concentrically along the outline of the passage 
aperture (20) at a short distance from its edge.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention is concerned with a gasket for exhaust tubes of 
internal combustion engines. Conventionally, exhaust tubes of internal combustion engines, 
such as in motor vehicles, are connected with flat-flange joints, 
clamped by two or three peripheral bolts. The high temperatures 
reached by the exhaust gas along the conduit (800Â°C and above) 
prevented in fact the use of most of the usual gaskets, with the 
exception of asbestos gaskets, which, however, are undesirable 
on the ground of unhealthiness. Although such gasketless joints 
have a defective seal, this was not a problem with conventional 
exhausts, where the exhaust gas was led through the muffler 
only for purposes of silencing, the pressure leaks along the 
conduit having in practice no harmful consequence. On the other hand, the problem of having a perfect seal does 
arise with modern catalytic exhausts, as well known to persons 
skilled in the field. In this case, the seal has been improved by 
insetion of a mica gasket in the joint, which gasket, as known, 
has the required property of resistance to high temperatures. 
Mica, however, is an expensive material, difficult to process, 
and, moreover, has a relatively low elasticity, which drops in 
the course of time. The need is therefore felt for a more 
practical and cheap solution to this problem.  Accordingly, it is the object of this invention to provide a 
gasket for exhaust tubes of internal combustion engines, which 
is easy and cheap to manufacture, which is free from asbestos, 
while still having the required properties of a good seal and 
temperature resistance. Such object, together with other objects and advantages, such 
as will appear in the following disclosure, are attained by the 
invention with a gasket having the features recited in claim 1. The invention will now be described in more detail with reference 
to a preferred embodiment, disclosed in the following 
specification and shown in the accompanying drawings, wherein: 
Fig. 1 is a plan view of a gasket for an exhaust tube of an 
internal combustion engine according to a preferred embodiment 
of the invention; and Fig. 2 is a cross-sectional view, to an enlarged scale, of a 
portion of the gasket of Fig. 1. With reference to the Figures, a graphite element 10 is formed of 
two sheets 12, 14 of lamellar graphite, coupled together with 
interposition of a metallic armor 16, which comprises a perforated 
plate, preferably of stainless steel, by alternately opposed 
punchings, such that transversal or oblique burrs
