<ABSTRACT>
The invention provides an industrially excellent process for producing a 2-alkyl-3-(biphenyl-4-yl)-methyl-3H-imidazo[4,5-b]pyridine 

derivative represented by general formula (II), serving as a precursor of the angiotensin II 
receptor antagonist useful as an antihypertensive, a biphenyl derivative serving as a precursor of the substituent of the 

imidazopyridine derivative, a process for producing the biphenyl derivative, and an intermediate useful for producing 
the biphenyl derivative. The imidazopyridine derivative (II) can be produced in a high yield according to the process of 

the invention by subjecting a 2-amino-5-halogeno-3-nitropyridine derivative to amidation, N-alkylation and reductive 
cyclization. This process is industrially excellent, because the halogen atom introduced into the 5-position as a 

protective group in the nitration step can be eliminated simultaneously in the subsequent step. The above biphenyl 
derivative is excellent in reactivity and product purity, thus being an intermediate suitable for industrial production.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a process for
the preparation of a biphenyloxazoline derivative which is an intermediate useful for the preparation of a 2-alkyl-3-(biphenyl-4-yl)methyl-3H-imidazo[4,5-b]pyridine
derivative which is
disclosed in, e.g., Japanese Patent Publication-A Nos.
3-95181 (and European Patent Publication-A No. 420237
corresponding thereof) and 3-236377 and is a precursor
of an antagonist against angiotensin II receptor
useful as an antihypertensive drug and a remedy for
hemal lesions. As described in, e.g., Japanese Patent
Publication-A No. 3-236377, it has been a practice in
the prior art to form the side chain of biphenyl of a
2-alkyl-3-(2'-alkoxycarbonylbiphenyl-4-yl)methyl-3H-imidazo[4,5-b]pyridine
derivative which is an
antagonist against angiotensin II receptor by a method
wherein the N-alkylation is conducted with a 
4'-bromomethyl-2-biphenylcarboxylic ester.Such a 4'-bromomethyl-2-biphenylcarboxylic ester
is prepared by a process which comprises preparing 4'-methyl-2-biphenyloxazoline
in a manner described in
Journal of Organic Chemistry (J. Org. Chem.), 43(7),
1372 to 1379, 1978, then hydrolyzing it into
4'-methyl-2-biphenylcarboxylic acid, then esterifying
it into a 4'-methyl-2-biphenylcarboxylic ester, and,
further, brominating it in a manner disclosed in the
Japanese Patent Publication-A No. 63-23868. This
preparation process is represented hereinafter
(reaction scheme-1):
The 4'-bromomethyl-2-biphenylcarboxylic ester
which has hitherto been used has a high activity to
react easily, but it could not be stored because it
was poor in stability due to its high activity.
Therefore, it had been prepared immediately before the
use and was extremely poor in workability. Further,
due to the high activity, the ester also has a
disadvantage of being liable to cause decomposition or
a side reaction in the reaction, so that the obtained
N-alkylation product had a low purity and the
by-products were varied to result in difficult
purification.. Furthermore, all of the processes 
disclosed in the prior art failed in the preparation
of a 4'-chloromethyl-2-biphenylcarboxylic ester
exhibiting a desirable reactivity in the N-alkylation.Further, N-bromosuccinimide has been used for the
bromination in the preparation of the 4'-bromomethyl-2-biphenylcarboxylic
ester according to the process
disclosed in the Japanese Patent Publication-A No. 63-23868.
However, there has been a disadvantage that it
is unsuitable for the industrial production thereof
because this reagent is expensive and the
