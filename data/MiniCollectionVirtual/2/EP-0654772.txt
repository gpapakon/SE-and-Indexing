<ABSTRACT>
A body detector (10) detects when a body (12) is absent 
from a region (26) being monitored. The body (12) has a different 

dielectric constant than air. The region (26) is configured as a 
capacitor (20) in which the body (12), if present, serves as a 

dielectric. The capacitance of the capacitor (20) is measured 
(28). This measurement influences a baseline value (34). The 

capacitance is measured (38) a second time. The second 
measurement is checked to verify that it is within minimum (42) 

and maximum (46) values. In addition, it is checked to verify that 
it is within a more narrow range (54) that is defined in response 

to the baseline value. The second measurement is then used to 
adjust the baseline value and the process repeats. The range (54) 

within which the capacitance must stay slowly adapts to changes 
in the capacitance of the capacitor (20). Abrupt changes in the 

capacitance cause an alarm to be annunciated.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates generally to devices which
detect the absence of a body. More specifically, the present
invention relates to devices for reliably determining
when a device has been removed from a body.Increasingly, various monitoring and processing systems
use body monitors. Body monitors are electronic devices which
attach to a person, animal, or inanimate object, hereinafter
referred to as a body, and perform some function with respect to
that body. Numerous examples of body monitors are known. In
connection with correctional facilities, prisoners may wear body
monitors that, among other things, help correctional officers
keep track of the prisoners' whereabouts. Likewise, in schools
and day care centers students may wear body monitors. Hospital
patients may wear body monitors to sense various patient
parameters. Body monitors may be placed on various items of
industrial equipment to sense operational parameters. In these
and other situations, some form of control facility receives or
otherwise processes information from the body monitors. For
security reasons and/or for judging the validity of information
being received from the body monitors, the control facility may
need to verify that the body monitor is actually associated with
the body being monitored.Techniques are known for detecting the absence of a body.
These known techniques may demonstrate acceptable reliability
when body monitors are used in stable environments or with
cooperative people. In situations where body monitors are used
around uncooperative or otherwise mischief-prone people, or
when the environment within which body monitors are used
changes widely or is tamper-prone, reliably detecting the absence
of a body is a difficult but important task.One known body detector intended for use in connection
with prisoner monitoring senses the capacitance of a capacitor
that uses the body as a dielectric. An alarm is annunciated 
whenever the capacitance drops below a predetermined minimum
capacitance. No alarm is declared so long as the capacitance remains
above the minimum capacitance. The predetermined minimum capacitance
is set at a level slightly greater than the value obtained when air is the
only dielectric of the capacitor.Failures in this and other alarm systems may result from either of
two error conditions. One error condition is the "false alarm" and the
other is the "false silence." The false alarm error occurs when the alarm
system declares an alarm in response to a situation where no alarm
should have been
