<ABSTRACT>
A vertical transistor which is built in a substrate of a given first carrier type 
utilizing standard processes but which has a unique layout which facilitates high 

voltage, high current operation while still conserving space. The transistor is built 
utilizing a repeatable combination gate/source area that is built in the upper area of 

the substrate such that the remaining lower portion of the substrate underneath the 
combination gate/source area is the drain area of the transistor.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates generally to high voltage transistors and more
particularly concerns a high current, high voltage transistor which is
fabricated in a vertical configuration to increase current handling of the transistor
and to reduce silicon area needed to produce the transistor.PMOS transistors are lateral devices. In high voltage applications, the
transistor is designed to withstand high voltages by constructing field plates around
the drain and n-well regions. The field plates even out the equipotential field lines
to avoid voltage concentrations. To increase current handling capability, the device
area of the transistor is increased. Therefore, high voltage, high current transistors
require a large area of silicon to accommodate the field plates and large device
areas.Figure 1 shows a cross-sectional view of a conventional high voltage
PMOS device 10. As the conventional PMOS device 10 is a symmetrical, circular
device only one-half of the device is shown in Figure 1. The conventional PMOS
device 10 is symmetrical across the centerline C1. The conventional PMOS device 10
has all the elements of a standard high voltage PMOS device, i.e., a source 12, a gate
area 14, a drain 16, an inner field plate 18, and an outer field plate 20.The drain 16 is the innermost region. Adjacent and immediately outside
of the drain 16 is an inner field plate 18. Underneath the inner field plate 18 is a p-pinchoff
region 17. Adjacent to and outside of the inner field plate 18 and the p-pinchoff
region 17 is the gate area 14. Adjacent to and above the gate area 14 is a
gate 13. Adjacent to and outside of the gate area 14 is an n-well connection 19.
Adjacent to and outside of the n-well connection 19 is the outer field plate 20.
Extending underneath the areas of the drain 16, the p-pinchoff region 17, the gate
area 14, the source 12 and past the n-well connection 19 is an n-well 22. The outer
field plate 20 provides high voltage capability to the n-well 22. Extending
underneath and past the outer field plate 20 and overlapping with the outermost 
edge of the n-well 22 is a field oxide 26. Extending underneath the field oxide 26 is a
n-pinchoff region 24.To accommodate large voltages and large currents, the conventional high
voltage PMOS device 10 is designed to cover a large area. The inner field plate 18
and the outer field plate 20 are used to avoid bunching of equipotential lines which
can cause the conventional PMOS device 10 to break down in operation. The field
plates 18, 20 are what give the vertical PMOS
