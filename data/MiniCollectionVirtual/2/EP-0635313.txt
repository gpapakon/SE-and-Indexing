<ABSTRACT>
A screening machine (1) comprising a plurality of rotors (20) 
adapted such that in a frame (10) the axes of the rotors (20) are 

arranged parallel to one another from a supply side where 
objects to be screened including mixed substances 

different at least in size are supplied from above by a 
conveying means (C1) to a discharge side where the remainders 

after screening are discharged, and such that the rotors (20) 
are rotated in the same direction by a rotating drive 

means (30), each rotor (20) further comprises at least two kinds of 
components, namely, a plurality of large diameter sections (25) 

and a plurality of small diameter sections (28) alternately 
disposed in the axial direction of each rotor (20) and arranged 

in a staggered relation in the feeding direction to define 

screening gaps (G) having desired dimensions between said 
large and small diameter sections.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates in general to a
screening machine for screening objects of different
sizes and more particularly to a screening machine for
screening architectural wastes generated when buildings
are pulled down, various mixed wastes including wastes
from households and offices, and sticky wastes such as
leftovers from restaurants, as well as compost, bark,
wood chips from sawmills, soil, rubble, etc. depending
on their sizes.As a conventional waste screening machine of this
kind, the applicant of the present invention has
proposed a screening machine which feeds large objects
over a plurality of rotary spiral members arranged
parallel to one another in the rotation direction
thereof, allows medium-sized and small objects to drop
between the spiral members, then allows small objects
to drop through a porous screen, and discharges 
medium-sized objects sideways by using the spiral
members (Japanese Laid-open Patent Publication No. 4-176374).
As shown in Fig. 18, this machine comprises a
plurality of spiral members 013 arranged in a plane at
a frame opening 012, the bottom of which is covered
with a screen 011 for screening small waste objects W1.
The spiral members rotate to convey large wastes W3 to
the discharge side of the machine and allow small and
medium-sized wastes W1 and W2 to drop through the gaps
between the spiral members 013, 013, and also allow
small wastes W1 through the screen 011, then discharge
wastes W2 remaining on the screen 011 in the spiraling
direction of the spiral member. This machine has been
favorably accepted by architectural waste treatment
contractors.Various ropes, cords and tapes included in wastes to
be screened may wind around the spiral members. To
remove such ropes, etc. machine operation must be
stopped occasionally. Furthermore, since damp or wet
leftovers or compost included in wastes tends to clog
the screen, it is apprehended that minute particles
such as soil cannot be separated by screening. EP-0340148 discloses a screening machine that has a plurality of rotor discs on a series of
generally parallel shafts. Shaft diameters and spacings are chosen to cause material of
respectively longer and shorter lengths to either remain on the rotors or tilt and fall beneath.
The screening bed is substantially horizontal or all or part of the bed may be slanted upwardly
or downwardly from the inlet to the outlet end of the bed.The present invention is intended to solve the above-mentioned problems of the conventional
technology A primary object of the present
</DESCRIPTION>
<CLAIMS>
A screening machine having a screening bed, a supply conveyor (C1) for supplying objects
(W) to be screened to the screening bed and first and second discharge means for receiving,

respectively, objects that have passed over and objects that have passed through the screening
bed,


the screening bed comprising a frame (10) with a row of rotors (20) having parallel, laterally
spaced axes, the rotors being rotatable in the same direction as one another by a drive means

(30) to urge objects supported on the rotors in a flow direction from the supply conveyor to
the first discharge means,
each rotor comprising a plurality of large and small diameter sections (25,28) alternately
disposed in the axial direction of each rotor and arranged in a staggered relationship in the flow

direction to define screening gaps (G),
the screening bed having at least a portion that is upwardly tilted in the flow direction and
characterised in that the upwardly tilted portion has a higher end proximate the supply

conveyor and a lower section disposed backwardly, with respect to the flow direction, of the
delivery point of objects onto the screening bed from the supply conveyor, the lower section

being covered by a housing with an opening (42,62) at its lower end constituting a third
discharge means for re
pelled, easy-to-roll and heavy objects (W4).
A screening machine according to claim 1 in which a first series of rotors is disposed in a
progressive upward incline to form the tilted portion and a second series of rotors is disposed

substantially horizontal.
A screening machine according to claim 2 in which the angle of the incline is adjustable.
A screening machine according to any preceding claim in which the screening bed has a
series of rotors defining a raised area (4c) which urges counter rotation of objects on the

rotors. 
A screening machine according to claim 4 in which a first series of rotors is disposed in a
progressive upward incline to form the tilted portion and a second series of rotors disposed

in a further progressive upward incline and the raised area is between the first and second
series of rotors.
A screening machine according to any preceding claim in which the small diameter sections
are profiled (28') to generate airflow.
A screening machine according to any preceding claim in which the large diameter sections
have a plurality of projections (26a) on at least one side.
A screening machine according to any preceding claim in which the large diameter section
(25) comprises a wheel having a plurality of finger-shaped projections (26) curved in the

opposite direction to the rotor rotation and interconnected by webs (27).
A screening machine according to any preceding claim in which the rotors are arranged in
a plurality of series in the flow direction with the peripheral speeds of each series decreasing

with respect to the previous series.
A screening machine according to any preceding claim in which the rotors are arranged
in a plurality of series in the flow direction and the gaps between adjacent large diameter

sections of each series increase with respect to the previous series.
A screening machine according to any preceding claim further comprising air blowing
means (45,46) to generate airflow upwardly with respect to a plurality of the rotors.
A screening machine according to any preceding claim in which the final rotor of the
plurality of rotors is rotated at an increased speed to separate differently weighted objects by

virtue of imparting different projectile paths.
A screening machine according to any preceding claim in which the rotors have a circular
shaft and the small diameter sections are constituted by exposed sections of the circular shaft.
