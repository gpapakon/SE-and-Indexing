<ABSTRACT>
A dispensing device or trigger sprayer which 
selectively draws fluid out from at least two containers, 

mixes the fluids in a desired concentration or ratio and 
expels the mixture of fluids out of a nozzle. The trig
ger 
sprayer is equipped with a metering device for variably 

controlling the ratio of the fluids being mixed. The 
containers or bottles connected to the trigger sprayer are 

selectively detachable for refilling a container with 
fluid or exchanging one of the containers with another 

container having an alternate fluid.

<DESCRIPTION>
The field of the present invention is devices 
for ejecting or spraying a fluid stream or spray through a 
nozzle from out of a container or bottle. The invention 
particularly relates to fluid containers for such devices. Heretofore, there have been various hand-held 
sprayers such as that disclosed in US-A-3 749 290 in which 
fluid from a container is pumped out by a pump mechanism 
comprised of a collapsible tubular bulb, the actuation of 
the trigger compressing the bulb to expel the fluid. Another 
type of trigger sprayer device is disclosed in US-A-4 
013 228 in which the trigger actuates the piston and 
cylinder combination which alternately draws fluid in from 
the container and then expels it out through a nozzle. These trigger-type sprayers draw fluid from a 
single container, the sprayer ejecting only that 
particular fluid and fluid concentration which is within 
the container. CA-A-1 104 531 discloses a trigger sprayer in 
accordance with the precharacterising portion of claim 1 
in which fluids can be drawn by action of the trigger from 
two chambers for mixing before ejection by the sprayer 
head. US-A-4 165 812 discloses an arrangement of 
containers which can be compactly connected together. According to the present invention, there is 
provided a bottle of a mated pair of first and second 
bottles for use in a handheld fluid dispensing system, 
said bottle having a generally cylindrical shape with one 
generally rounded side and one generally flat side, the 
flat side containing mating means for mating with 
corresponding mating means on the second bottle, the first 
bottle being arranged to be nested in a substantially 
mating relationship to at least a second bottle, wherein  
 
the flat side is matable with a flat side of such a second 
bottle of identical configuration in a side by side 
relationship below a handheld fluid dispensing system. The invention will be further described, by way 
of example, with reference to the accompanying drawings, 
in which:- 
Figure 1 is a side elevation view of a two-bottle 
trigger sprayer according to the preferred 
embodiment of the present invention; Figure 2 is the spray and bottle combination of 
Figure 1 in a partial cut-away view illustrating the 
internal mechanisms; Figure 3 is a cross-sectional view of the spray 
bottle of Figure 1 taken along the line 3-3; Figure 3a is a cross-sectional view of the 
bottle combination of Figure 2 taken along the line 3a-3a; Figure 3b is a cross-sectional view of the spray 
bottle combination of Figure 2

<CLAIMS>
A bottle (22) of a mated pair of first and 
second bottles (220,240) for use in a handheld fluid 

dispensing system (5), said bottle having a generally 
cylindrical shape with one generally rounded side and one 

generally flat side (220a), the flat side containing 
mating means (228,230) for mating with corresponding 

mating means (248,250) on the second bottle, the first 
bottle being arranged to be nested in a substantially 

mating relationship to at least a second bottle, wherein 
the flat side is matable with a flat side of such a second 

bottle of identical configuration in a side by side 
relationship below a handheld fluid dispensing system. 
A bottle according to claim 1, wherein the 
mating means on the flat side is comprised of given number 

of longitudinally arranged columns of protrusions and an 
equal number of longitudinally arranged columns of 

corresponding depressions. 
A bottle according to claim 2, wherein the 
longitudinally arranged columns consist of a first column 

and a second column, wherein each of the protrusions in a 
column has a corresponding mating depression in the other 

column such that all the protrusions in the flat side of 
the bottle mate with corresponding depressions in a flat 

side of a second bottle of identical configuration and all 
the depressions in the flat side of the bottle mate with 

corresponding protrusions in the flat side of the second 
bottle. 
A bottle according to claim 3, wherein the 
first column consists of a single longitudinal groove 

(230) and the second column consists of a single 
longitudinal tongue (228). 
A bottle according to claim 1, 2, 3 or 4, 
further comprising (a) a neck portion (222), (b) a 

retainer plug (260) positioned within the neck portion, 
the retainer plug having an inner passage (264b) and an 

outer annular passage (262a), (c) a seal (90,90a) 
positioned in the outer annular passage for permitting air 

to enter the bottle through the annular passage and 
inhibiting fluid from exiting the bottle out through the 

outer annular passage. 
A bottle according to claim 5, wherein the 
seal comprises a retainer seal positioned in the annular 

passage in a flexed condition to exert positive pressure 
against side walls. 
A bottle according to claim 6, wherein the 
retainer seal has a generally tubular shape with a first 

cylindrical portion (92) which fits tightly against an 
inner surface of the annular passage and a diagonally 

outwardly extending portion (94) extending outward from 
the cylindrical portion toward an outer surface of the 

annular passage. 
A bottle according to any one of the 
preceding claims, further compris
ing a collar for 
permitting detachable connection to a handheld fluid 

dispensing device independent from a second bottle. 
A bottle according to claim 8, wherein the 
collar includes a pair of outwardly extending ears (226) 

spaced about the neck portion (222) for providing 
detachable connection to the handheld fluid dispensing 

device. 
A bottle (220) for use with a handheld, 
fluid dispensing system (5) for multiple containers, the 

bottle comprising (a) a neck portion (222); (b) a retainer 
plug (260) positioned within the neck portion, the 

retainer plug having an inner passage (264b) and an outer 
annular passage (262a), the inner passage providing for 

communication of fluid in the bottle to the fluid 
dispensing system; and (c) a seal (90,90a) positioned in 

the outer annular passage for permitting air to enter the 
bottle through the annular passage and inhibiting fluid 

from exiting the bottle out through the outer annular 
passage. 
A bottle according to claim 10, wherein the 
seal comprises a retainer seal positioned in the annular 

passage in a flexed condition to exert positive pressure 
against side walls. 
A bottle according to claim 11, wherein the 
retainer seal has a generally tubular shape with a first 

cylindrical portion (92) which fits tightly against an 
inner surface of the annular passage and a diagonally 

outwardly extending portion (94) extending outward from 
the first cylindrical portion toward an outer surface of 

the annular passage. 
A bottle according to claim 10, 11 or 12,
