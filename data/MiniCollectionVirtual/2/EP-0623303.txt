<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to an electric cooking apparatus comprising a base (1) in the form of a frame, a removable tray (2) designed to rest on said base, an electric heating element (4) arranged above the tray (2) and having a handle (4'), and a grill (5) placed above the element (4) and able to hold either food for grilling or a cooking stone (6) whose top surface (7) acts as a grill. According to the invention this apparatus comprises a control unit for controlling the electrical power supply to the element (4) comprising a switch (9), the control device (10) of which is connected to a sensor (11) that senses the temperature of the wall of the tray (2) and whose temperature control threshold is set above the range of temperatures when the grill (5) only is operating.

Electrical cooking appliance comprising a base (1) in the 
form of a frame, a removable box (2) designed to rest on the 

said base, an electrical heating element (4) disposed above 
the box (2), and a flat support (5) able to receive a cooking 

plate (6) whose top face (7) serves as a grill, characterised 
in that, the heating element (4) being provided with a handle 

(4') and the support (5) being shaped as a grid placed above 
the element (4) and able to receive directly, when the cooking 

plate (6) is not in position, food to be grilled, it also 
includes a unit for controlling the electrical supply to the 

element (4) comprising a switch (9) whose control device (10) 
is connected to a probe (11) sensing the temperature of the 

wall of the box (2) and whose temperature regulation threshold 
is set above the temperature range when operating with the 

grid (5) alone. 
Electrical cooking appliance according to Claim 1, 
characterised in that the switch (9) and control device (10) 

are the components of a thermostatic switch. 
Electrical cooking appliance according to Claim 2, 
characterised in that the temperature probe (11) includes a 

small metal plate (13) which is arranged outside the control 
unit and facing the side wall (12) of the box (2), and means 

for conducting heat to the control device (10) of the switch 
(9). 
Electrical cooking appliance according to Claim 3, 
characterised in that the conduction means also constitute 

means (14) for fixing the small plate (13) to the control 
unit. 
Electrical cooking appliance according to Claim 1, 
characterised in that the switch (9) is of the electronic type  

 
and the temperature probe (11) is an infrared sensor of the 

pyroelectrical or thermopile type. 
Electrical cooking appliance according to any one of the 
preceding claims, characterised in that, the base having a 

housing (15), the handle (4') has a casing of a shape 
complementary to that of the housing and contains the control 

unit.
