<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention is directed to a
shampoo-conditioner composition and to a method of
treating hair, wherein the aqueous shampoo-conditioner
composition includes a water-insoluble primary amine.
More particularly, a shampoo-conditioner composition of
the present invention comprises: (a) a cleansing
surfactant selected from the group consisting of a
nonionic surfactant, an amphoteric surfactant and
combinations thereof, like an alkyl polyglycoside or
coco amphodiacetate; (b) a water-insoluble primary
amine having about fourteen to about twenty-two carbon
atoms; (c) a sufficient amount of a suitable acid
selected from the group consisting of an inorganic
mineral acid, an aliphatic carboxylic acid including up
to about 5 carbon atoms and combinations thereof; and
(d) a carrier comprising water, wherein the composition
includes a sufficient amount of acid such that at least
30 mole percent of the primary amine is neutralized and
such that the composition has a pH of about 4 to about
8. The shampoo-conditioner compositions optionally
include a quaternary ammonium compound having one long
carbon chain having about 12 to about 18 carbon atoms,
a water-soluble amine at pH 6 or a mixture thereof.
The shampoo-conditioner compositions simultaneously
clean and condition the hair. Most individuals buy and use a hair shampoo
for its cleansing properties. A consumer often also
desires a hair shampoo that conditions the hair.
However, hair shampoos generally are formulated with
highly-effective anionic surfactants that are
nonsubstantive to the hair and primarily cleanse the
hair. Therefore, shampoos typically neither aid in the
detangling of wet hair nor condition dry hair, such as
improving the manageability or styleability of hair
sets.After shampooing with an anionic surfactant-based
hair shampoo, the hair normally is left in a
cosmetically-unsatisfactory state because anionic
surfactants not only remove the dirt and soil from the
hair, but also remove essentially all of the sebum
naturally present on the surface of the hair fibers.
Therefore, although anionic surfactants effectively
cleanse the hair, hair shampoo compositions containing
anionic surfactants leave the hair with an harsh, dull
and dry touch, or feel, usually called "creak", after
the hair is shampooed and then rinsed with water.Thoroughly cleansed hair is extremely
difficult to comb, in either the wet or dry state,
because individual hair fibers tend to snarl, kink and
interlock with each other. In addition, incompletely
dried hair, such as hair
