<ABSTRACT>
A fire-fighting system in which a liquid chemical foamant is 
introduced into the water stream in varying amounts so as to 

maintain a predetermined percentage mixture irrespective of 
variations in the water flow includes a motor-driven pump where the 

motor is controlled over first speed range by pulse width 
modulating the drive to the motor and over a second speed range, 

producing intermittent motion, by burst width modulating the drive 
signal when it is operating at its minimum pulse width modulated 

duty cycle. Using this technique the range of available motor 
speeds is extended well beyond that which can be achieved using 

pulse width modulation of the motor drive signal alone.

<DESCRIPTION>
I. Field of the Invention: This invention relates generally 
to a motor and motor speed controller assembly, and in particular 
such an assembly incorporated in 
a fire extinguishing apparatus in which a calculated quantity of a 
liquid chemical foamant is introduced into the main water stream 
being directed at a fire, 
by a positive displacement pump driven by a DC motor that is 
energized by a pulse width modulated signal over a first range of 
speeds and by a fixed-width burst-modulated pulse width modulated 
signal over a second range of speeds. II. Discussion of the Prior Art: In the Haugen et al. Patent 
US-A-5,174,383, assigned to applicant's assignee, there is described an 
apparatus and method for controlling the introduction of chemical 
foamant into a water stream in fire-fighting equipment. That 
system generally comprises a water supply arranged to deliver water 
at varying flow rates through a hose. Associated with the hose is 
a flow meter which produces an electrical signal proportional to 
the rate of water flow through the hose. The chemical foamant is 
contained within a supply tank and a positive displacement piston 
pump having an adjustable piston stroke is driven by a variable 
speed electric motor for pumping the chemical foamant from the 
supply tank into the water stream passing through the hose. A 
microprocessor-based controller receives the electrical signal from 
the flow meter as well as another signal proportional to pump speed 
and then computes the rate at which the electric motor driving the 
pump should be driven to introduce a metered quantity of the 
chemical foamant into the hose such that the percentage  
 
concentration of the foamant in the water remains at a preset value 
even though the water flow through the hose varies. While the described system works well to introduce prescribed 
quantities of chemical foamant into the water stream so as to 
maintain a desired ratio of chemical foamant to water, it does so 
at the price of requiring a pump having an adjustable stroke so 
that both pump speed and stroke are adjustable parameters. It had 
heretofore not been possible to maintain a desired percentage of 
chemical foamant over the entire range of flows which are 
encountered in fire-fighting situations without having to shut down 
the system so that the pump stroke could be reset. It has been demonstrated that Class A Foam is from five to ten 
times more effective as a fire suppressant than water alone. 
Utilizing foam, fires are extinguished faster and with
