<ABSTRACT>
A pump comprising a pump housing (12) and a rotor (28) driven by a shaft (10), said rotor having at least two outwardly spring-biased elements (30). These lie in contact with the wall of a chamber (27) surrounding the rotor and transport, during rotation of the rotor, a gas and fluid medium from a suction port (15) to a pressure port (16) in the housing. The chamber (27) is arranged in a body (18) which is displaceable inside the housing (12) in such a way that the chamber is movable between two end positions, of which one end position is concentric with, or presents a comparatively small excentricity with respect to, the rotating shaft (10) of the rotor and which second end position presents a comparatively large excentricity with respect to said shaft. The pump is moreover provided with means for positioning of the body (18) in the pump housing.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a pump comprising a pump
housing and a shaft driven rotor having at least two
outwardly spring-biased vane elements which lie in contact
with the wall of a chamber surrounding the rotor and which,
during rotation of said rotor, transport a gas and fluid
medium from a suction port to a pressure port in the pump
housing, the chamber being arranged in a body which is
displaceable inside the pump housing in such a way that the
chamber is moveable between two end positions, of which one
end position is concentric with, or presents a comparatively
small excentricity with respect to the rotating shaft of
the shaft of the rotor and which other end position
presents a comparatively larger excentricity with respect
to said shaft, the pump being provided with means for
positioning of the body in the pump housing, the body being
formed by a sliding block which is displaceably supported
between two walls in the pump housing, and the sliding
block being connected with a control rod which extends out
through one of the two walls, the control rod being
spring-biased in a direction towards said one wall, a space
being arranged between said wall and the side of the
sliding block lying closest thereto, said space communicating
with the pressure ports, said space between the second
wall and the opposite side of the sliding block communicating
with the suction port, the vane elements of the rotor
being supported, in pairs, in tracks which extend through
the rotor. Pumps according to the above are used for example for
producing lubrication oil pressure in combustion engines
for vehicles. The oil is transported by pressure to various
parts of the engine and is used for lubricating a large
number of bearings and hydraulic engine components.It is normally required of an oil pump that it should give
the required pressure even at the idling speed of the
engine. Thus at higher speeds an unnecessarily high oil
pressure is produced, which has to be reduced in some way,
e.g. via an overflow valve.The pump is normally driven by a power take-off from the
engine drive shaft and the overproduction of oil pressure
therefore has an effect on both the fuel consumption and
the usable power. A variable displacement pump should be
able to reduce the power requirement especially at speeds
above idling. Such pumps are known but present disadvantages
since they are comparatively expensive and complicated.From US-A-3 238 884 and US-A-3 924 970 a variable displacement
pump is prior known having vanes which are

Pump comprising a pump housing (12) and a shaft
driven rotor (28) having at least two outwardly spring-biased

vane elements (30), which lie in contact with the
wall of a chamber (27) surrounding the rotor and which,

during rotation of said rotor, transport a gas and fluid
medium from a suction port (15) to a pressure port (16) in

the pump housing, the chamber (27) being arranged in a body
(18) which is displaceable inside the pump housing (12) in

such a way that the chamber is moveable between two end
positions, of which one end position is concentric with, or

presents a comparatively small excentricity with respect to
the rotating shaft (10) of the rotor (28) and which other

end position presents a comparatively larger excentricity
with respect to said shaft, the pump being provided with

means for positioning of the body (18) in the pump housing,
the body being formed by a sliding block (18) which is

displaceably supported between two walls in the pump
housing (12), and the sliding block (18) being connected

with a control rod (19) which extends out through one of
the two walls, the control rod (19) being spring-biased in

a direction towards said one wall, a space (17a) being
arranged between said wall and the side of the sliding

block (18) lying closest thereto, said space communicating
with the pressure ports (16), said space (17b) between the

second wall and the opposite side of the sliding block (18)
communicating with the suction port (15), the vane elements

(30) of the rotor being supported, in pairs, in tracks (29)
which extend through the rotor (28), 
characterized in
 that spring members (31) being constrained
between said pairs of elements, said tracks (29) and spring

members (31) being common for each pair of vane elements 
(30), a channel (32) extending between the pressure port

(16) and a central portion of the pump rotor (28) radially
behind the vane elements (30) in order to lead fluid

pressure from the pressure port also behind the vane
elements in order to press the vanes into contact with the

wall of the chamber.
Pump according to claim 1,

characterized
 in that the control rod (19) is
connected with damping means (19a, 21 - 24).
Pump according to claim 2, 
characterized
 in that the damping means comprises a piston
(19a) displaceable in a cylindrical chamber (21), said

chamber containing a damping fluid and said piston being
provided with a nozzle (23) for throttling the damping

fluid flow from one side of the piston to the other.
