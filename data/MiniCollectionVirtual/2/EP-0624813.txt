<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to fluid suspensions for
light valves and more particularly to methods and materials
for stabilizing liquid suspensions and films thereof from
ultraviolet radiation.Light valves have been used for almost 60 years for
modulation of light. A light valve may be described as a cell
formed of two walls that are spaced apart by a small distance,
at least one wall being transparent, the walls having
electrodes thereon usually in the form of transparent
electrically conductive coatings. The cell contains a "light
valve suspension" which may be either a liquid light valve
suspension or a film containing droplets of a liquid light
valve suspension as described hereinafter. The liquid light
valve suspension comprises a plurality of small particles
suspended in a liquid suspending medium. In the absence of
an applied electrical field, the particles in the liquid light
valve suspension exhibit random Brownian movement, and hence
a beam of light passing into the cell is reflected,
transmitted or absorbed, depending upon the nature and
concentration of the particles and the energy content of the
light. When an electric field is applied through the light 
valve suspension in the light valve, the particles become
aligned and for many suspensions most of the light can pass
through the cell. Light valves have been proposed for many
purposes including, e.g., alphanumeric displays, television
displays, windows, mirrors, filters, ski goggles, eyeglasses
and the like to control the amount of light passing
therethrough. Alternatively, in place of the liquid light
valve suspension described above, one may use in the light
valve a film comprising a polymer matrix having droplets of
a liquid suspension distributed throughout the polymer matrix,For more details, see the section, infra,
entitled "Light Valve Films". The light valve suspension of the present invention may
be any liquid light valve suspension comprising droplets of
a liquid light valve suspension for a light valve known in the
art or known to the inventors of the present invention or
hereafter known and may be formulated according to known
techniques. The term "light valve liquid suspension" or
"liquid suspension" as used herein means a "liquid suspending
medium" in which a plurality of small particles are dispersed.
The "liquid suspending medium" comprises one or more non-aqueous,
electrically resistive liquids in which there is
preferably dissolved at least one type of polymeric stabilizer
which acts to reduce the tendency of the
