<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a hydraulically damped rubber bushing comprising an outer tube (2) that can be press-fitted in a receiving hole in a part (8) of a motor vehicle, an inner part (1) that can be connected to a second part of the motor vehicle, and a rubber body (3) which is arranged in between and has a plurality of chambers (4, 5) which are sealed off from the outside, filled with a fluid and connected to one another by transfer passages, restricted passages (6). Flutes (9), channels, grooves or similar depressions running longitudinally in the press-fitting direction are provided on the outer circumference of the outer tube (2), which has a slight oversize relative to the diameter of the receiving hole.

<CLAIMS>
Hydraulically damping sleeve-type rubber spring, 
comprising an outer metal tube (2) pressable into a 

location hole of a motor vehicle part (8), a metal 
inner part (1) connectable to a second motor vehicle 

part and, disposed between said parts, a rubber body 
(3) having a plurality of externally sealed chambers 

(4, 5), which are filled with a liquid and connected to 
one another by overflow channels or throttle channels 

(6), which are delimited radially at the outside by the 
substantially smooth inner wall of the outer tube (2), 

characterized in that provided in the outer periphery 
of the outer tube (2), which has a slight oversize 

compared to the diameter of the location hole in the 
motor vehicle part (8), are furrows (9), flutes or 

grooves extending longitudinally in press-in direction, 
the contact of the pressed-in outer tube (2) with the 

wall of the location hole in the motor vehicle part (8) 
being line contact with free spaces lying between the 

points of line contact. 
Sleeve-type rubber spring according to claim 1, 
characterized in that the furrows (9), flutes or 

grooves arranged in a longitudinally extending manner 
are provided in the outer surface of an outer tube (2) 

made of aluminium.
