<ABSTRACT>
A chiral smectic liquid crystal device with a 
good planar homogeneity in a layer normal direction 

can be constituted by disposing a chiral smectic 
liquid crystal having no cholesteric phase between a 

pair of substrates having mutually different 
characters, particularly in terms of Iso - SmA phase 

transition temperature. The liquid crystal may 
preferably have a layer spacing-changing 

characteristic such that it provides a layer spacing 
d

 at a first transition point where the layer spacing 
of the liquid crystal begins to decrease on 

temperature decrease in the vicinity of a transition 
temperature from SmA phase to SmC* phase and a layer 

spacing d

 at a second transition point where the 
layer spacing of the liquid crystal begins to increase 

on further temperature decrease from the first 
transition point, satisfying 0.96 ≦ d

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a liquid
crystal device, particularly a chiral smectic liquid
crystal device, suitable for use in a liquid crystal
display device, a liquid crystal shutter, etc. More
specifically, the present invention relates to a
chiral smectic liquid crystal device having improved
display characteristics and drive characteristics
through an improvement in alignment state of liquid
crystal molecules.A display device of the type which controls
transmission of light in combination with a polarizing
device by utilizing the refractive index anisotropy of
ferroelectric liquid crystal molecules, has been
proposed by Clark and Lagerwall (Japanese Laid-Open
Patent Application (JP-A) 56-107216, U.S. Patent No.
4,367,924, etc.). The ferroelectric liquid crystal
has generally chiral smectic C phase (SmC*) or H phase
(SmH*) of a non-helical structure in a specific
temperature range and, in the SmC* or SmH* phase,
shows a property of assuming either one of a first
optically stable state and a second optically stable
state responding to an electrical field applied
thereto and maintaining such a state in the absence of
an electrical field, namely bistability, and also has 
a quick responsiveness to the change in electric
field. Thus, it is expected to be widely utilized in
a high speed and memory type display device and
particularly to provide a large-area, high-resolution
display according to a simple matrix drive scheme in
view of its function.For an optical modulating device using a
ferroelectric liquid crystal having such bistability
to exhibit desirable driving characteristics, it is
required that the liquid crystal disposed between a
pair of substrates should be in such a molecular
alignment state that switching between the above two
stable states may occur effectively irrespective of
the application of an electrical field.As a result of X-ray diffraction analysis, it
has been confirmed that the actual layer structure of
a smectic liquid crystal in a device is not an
initially expected bookshelf layer structure wherein
smectic layers are aligned substantially
perpendicularly to the substrates without bending of
the layers but is a chevron layer structure wherein
the layers are bent in the form of a chevron between
the substrates because of a decrease in smectic layer
thickness (generally called "layer spacing" in the
art) accompanying a transition from the SmA phase to 
the SmC* phase. In the chevron layer structure, the
following relationship representing a uniform
alignment:
