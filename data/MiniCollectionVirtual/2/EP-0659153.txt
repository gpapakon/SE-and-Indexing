<ABSTRACT>
A suspended beverage infusion bag (10, 20) is disclosed. The bag has a cover (13, 23) which is two generally planar leaves (12, 22) separated by a fold line (14, 24). The fold line (14, 24) may be vertical or horizontal, depending on the style of the infusion bag. Both of the cover leaves (12, 22) have a downwardly-facing slot (11, 21) which fits over and fastens the cover (13, 23) to the rim (1) of a beverage cup (2), thereby holding the leaves (12, 22) in spaced-apart relationship on the cup rim (1). A porous filter bag (15, 25) is attached to the cover (13, 23); either along one of the filter bag's side surfaces (17, 27), or along its stop edge, by a single glue line (31) on one side surface (18, 30) of a planar leave (12, 22). When one filter bag (15, 25) is used, it is attached to the cover (13, 23) near the fold line (14, 24). When two filter bags (15, 25) are used, they are attached to the cover near the side or bottom edges of the two leaves (12, 22). This way, the filter bag (15, 25) is suspended near the center inside of the cup (2), away from the cup side walls (5) and easily available for contact on all sides with the water (3) in the cup.

TITLE OF INVENTION:SUSPENDED BEVERAGE INFUSION BAGD E S C R I P T I O N BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTIONThis application is a continuation-in-part of my prior, co-pending application, Serial No. 07/940,063, filed 3 September 1992 and entitled SUSPENDED BEVERAGE INFUSION BAG, the disclosure of which is hereby incor- porated by reference thereto.Technical Field. This invention relates generally to means for preparing beverages. More particularly, it relates to infusion bags for preparing coffee and tea, which bags may be conveniently supported by the rim of a cup, and suspended therein.Background Art. U.S. Patent No. 3,895,118, Rambold. discloses a beverage infusion filter bag stapled to a folded strip of non-porous sheet material. The folded strip has two side portions on opposite sides of the filter bag which may be folded back upon themselves and secured together by complimentary slits in the side por¬ tions.U.S. Patent No. 4,141,997, S roka et al. , discloses a beverage infusion bag free of direct attachments which is clipped to the rim and side wall of a cup by an arched clip. 

 U.S. Patent No. 4,584,101, Kataoka, discloses a bever¬ age filter assembly with a generally rectangular support plate having an intermediate portion and a pair of support legs connected to opposite ends of the intermediate por- tion. The support legs have feet such that, when the support legs are folded vertically downward relative to the intermediate portion, the feet are engageable with the upper edge of a beverage container for supporting the whole assembly in a raised position above the container for use as a filter.U.S. Patent No. 4,726,956, Christie, discloses a tea bag with a 2-leave cover. The bag is stapled to one leaf below the fold line so that leaf will support the bag on the rim of the cup with a wedging action. The other leaf is folded back away from the bag which is cantilevered within the cup and exposed for contact with the water poured into the cup.U.S. Patent No. 4,871,555, Schwartz, et al. , discloses an infusion device comprising a porous bag with a stirring and hanging unit partially located within the bag, and partially protruding from the bag. The stirring and hanging unit is rigid or partially rigid.U.S. Patent No. 4,948,601, Serbu, discloses a coffee brewing device which comprises an elongated filter bag attached at one of its side edges to a bag support element which hooks over the rim of a cup at the element's top end. At the element's bottom end is an unattached carved portion which fits down into and
