<ABSTRACT>
A process is disclosed for continuously producing in a single stage biodegradable films from vegetable raw materials in the form of carbohydrates. Modification and plastification of the vegetable raw material, as well as film production, are carried out without interruption in a single processing stage. The advantages of the invention lie in the low shearing strain to which the starch molecules are subjected, thus in improved use properties of the film, as well as in a time-, energy- and space-saving economical production.

A method for preparing biodegradable films on the basis
of plant-based raw materials in the form of starch or

starch derivatives, cellulose derivatives or gum,
characterized in that the plastification of the plant-based

raw materials and subsequent film preparation are
done continuously and in one step comprising the steps

of:

a) continuously adding measured plant-based raw
materials and, if desired, solid additives through a

first inlet (11) as well as, if desired, liquid
additives through a second inlet (12) in a first

section (1) and mixing them,
b) heating and kneading the mixture in a second section
(2) and optionally continuously adding liquid

additives through a third inlet (13),
c) heating and reacting the plant-based raw materials
with the added additives in a third section (3) to

form a melt,
d) evacuating said melt in a vacuum apparatus (14) in a
fourth section (4), wherein water is allowed to

evaporate from the melt and removed by extraction,
thus causing the melt to cool down,
e) further cooling the melt in a fifth section (5),
f) compressing the melt in a sixth section (6),
g) blow extruding the melt through a die (7; 8) to form
a film (15),

wherein in process step a) and/or b) at least one
additive is added. 
The method according to claim 1 wherein in step a) solid
additives are additionally added continuously through

the fisrt inlet (11) and liquid additives through a
second inlet (12), and in step b) liquid additives are

added continuous through a third inlet (13) and in
step c) the added additives are heated together with the

plant-based raw materials and react with them.
The method according to claim 1 or 2, characterized in
that the raw materials are modified and/or disintegrated

during the process.
The method according to any one of claims 1 to 3,
characterized in that the plant-based raw material is a

native starch in a natural or hybrid form derived, for
example, from potatoes, manioc, peas, beans, corn, wax

corn, corn with high amylose content, grain such as
wheat and fractions prepared therefrom, barley or

sorghum, starch derivatives consisting of physically
and/or chemically modified starch, cellulose derivative,

gum, hemicellulose, or a hydrocolloid or a mixture of
one or a plurality of these raw materials.
The method according to any one of claims 1 to 4,
characterized in that the mixture or melt is

transported, mixed and compressed in the first to sixth
sections (1 to 6) by means of a screw-type extruder

(10), depending on the configuration of the screw
elements in each of one sections (1 to 6) and on the

rotational speed of the screws.
The method according to any one of claims 1 to 5,
characterized in that in the first to sixth sections (1

to 6) the temperature may be adjusted selectively. 
The method according to any one of claims 1 to 6,
characterized in that the die is a tubular die (7) and a

blown film (15) is molded.
The method according no any one of claims 1 to 7,
characterized in that the die is a double tubular die

(8) and a blown film (15) is molded.
The method according to any one of claims 1 to 8,
characterized in that a metering device (17) for the

plant-based raw materials and additives is provided

one-lead screw (19) is provided between the screw-type
extruder (10) and the die (7, 8).
The method according to any one of claims 4 to 10,
characterized in that the screw-type extruder (10) is a
