<ABSTRACT>
A valve seat assembly has a valve seat insert (11) 
positioned in a recess (12) in a cast iron cylinder head 

(13). The recess has a first outer portion (14) having a 
first diameter, and a second inner portion (15) having a 

second diameter which is smaller than the first diameter, 
and a circumferential groove (16) extending laterally into 

the cylinder head from the first outer portion (14) of the 
recess. The valve seat insert (11) has a main external 

diameter which is a sliding fit with the outer portion (14) 
of the recess, and is formed of material softer than the 

material defining the cylinder head recess. When the 
insert is forced into the recess beyond the outer portion 

(14) of the recess, material of the insert (11) is deformed 
into the groove (16) of the recess to lock the insert into 

the recess.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a valve seat insert 
for a cylinder head for an internal combustion engine; to a 
set of components to form a cylinder head assembly; and to 
a method of securing a valve seat insert in a cylinder 
head. Conventional valve seat inserts are essentially simple 
cylindrical rings that are held in place in a cylindrical 
head by compressive stress generated in the head itself. 
This compressive stress is produced either by forcing a 
valve seat insert into a head with a positive interference 
between the valve seat insert and the cylinder head, or by 
contraction of the head and expansion of the valve seat 
inserts after the insert has been placed in the head at a 
temperature lower than that of the cylinder head. The 
latter is the so-called cryogenically fitted valve seat. One method of removing the need to heat the seat 
and/or cool the insert is a mechanically locked device 
which can be used for aluminium heads only. In this 
system, the action of pushing the insert into the aluminium 
head causes aluminium to be mechanically moved into a 
circumferential groove in the insert, locking it in 
position. It is necessary that the insert material is 
stronger than the aluminium, as the insert has to be able 
to deform the aluminium into the groove without being 
distorted itself. This method is only useful therefore for 
aluminium cylinder heads and cannot be used with cast iron 
cylinder heads because the insert cannot deform the cast 
iron and therefore cannot fill the groove in the insert to 
provide a mechanical lock. It is one object of the present invention to provide a 
method of locking a valve seat insert into a cast iron  
 
cylinder head whereby the insert is locked in position 
without the need for cryogenically fitting the insert. According to the present invention in one aspect there 
is provided a set of components to form a cylinder head 
assembly, comprising a cylinder head for an internal 
combustion engine, and a valve seat insert for insertion 
into a recess in the cylinder head, in which the valve seat 
insert is formed at least in part of material which is 
softer than the material defining the cylinder head recess, 
and the recess has an opening extending laterally into the 
cylinder head from the recess, such that when the valve 
insert is forced into the recess, material of the valve 
seat insert is deformed into the lateral opening of the 
recess to lock the insert into the recess. In one preferred form, the recess has a first, outer, 
portion

<CLAIMS>
A set of components to form a cylinder head assembly, 
comprising: 

   a cylinder head (13) for an internal combustion 
engine, and 

   a valve seat insert (11) for insertion into a recess 
(12) in the cylinder head, 

   characterised in that the valve seat insert (11) is 
formed at least in part of material which is softer than 

the material defining the cylinder head recess (12), and 
the recess has an opening (16) extending laterally into the 

cylinder head (13) from the recess, such that when the 
valve insert is forced into the recess, material of the 

valve seat insert is deformed into the lateral opening (16) 
of the recess to lock the insert into the recess. 
A set according to claim 1 in which the recess has a 
first, outer, portion (14) having a first diameter, and a 

second, inner, portion (15) having a second diameter which 
is smaller than the first diameter, the said lateral 

opening (16) extending laterally into the cylinder head 
(13) from the first, outer, portion of the recess, the 

valve seat insert (11) having a main external diameter 
substantially equal to the diameter of the outer portion 

(14) of the recess, and the arrangement being such that 
when the valve insert is forced into the recess beyond the 

outer portion of the recess, material of the valve seat 
insert is deformed into the lateral opening (16) of the 

recess (12) to lock the insert into the recess. 
A set according to claim 2 in which the said lateral 
opening comprises a circumferential groove (16) extending 

laterally into the cylinder head (13) from the first, 
outer, portion (14) of the recess. 
A set according to claim 2 or 3 in which the insert 
has an inner, pilot, portion (17) having an external 

diameter smaller than the said main external diameter and 
substantially equal to the said second diameter of the 

recess, to assist in centring the insert in the recess.

recess has a third, inner, portion (18) having a third 

diameter which is smaller than the second diameter for 
providing a stop to prevent the insert (11) from being 

pushed into the recess beyond a desired predetermined 
extent. 
A set according to any preceding claim in which the 
insert is formed of at least two materials of different 

hardness, the valve seat being formed in a first region 
(20) of the insert (11) of a first material, and the insert 

including a second region (21) of material softer than the 
first region, the softer material being positioned so as to 

be deformed into the opening (16) when the valve seat 
insert is forced into the recess. 
A valve seat insert for a cylinder head of an internal 
combustion engine, comprising a ring shaped structure (11)
