<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to certain substituted fused
heterocyclic compounds which are useful as herbicides
and their agriculturally suitable compositions as well
as methods for their use as general or selective
preemergent or postemergent herbicides or as plant
growth regulants.New compounds effective for controlling the growth
of undesired vegetation are in constant demand. In the
most common situation, such compounds are sought to
selectively control the growth of weeds in useful crops
such as cotton, rice, corn, wheat and soybeans, to name
a few. Unchecked weed growth in such crops can cause
significant losses, reducing profit to the farmer and
increasing costs to the consumer. In other situations,
herbicides are desired which will control all plant
growth. Examples of areas in which complete control of
all vegetation is desired are areas around railroad
tracks, storage tanks and industrial storage areas.
There are many products commercially available for
these purposes, but the search continues for products
which are more effective, less costly and
environmentally safe.U.S. 5,032,165 discloses herbicidal compounds of
the formula 
The invention comprises novel compounds of Formula
I, agriculturally suitable compositions containing
them, and their method-of-use as preemergent and/or
postemergent herbicides and/or plant growth regulants
