<ABSTRACT>
An aluminum nitride sintered body comprising 
aluminum nitride crystals belonging to a Wurtzite 

hexagonal crystal system wherein the 3 axes a, b and c 
of the unit lattice of the crystal are defined such 

that the ratio b/a of the lengths of the axes b and a 
is 1.000 near the center of the crystal grain and lies 

within the range 0.997 - 1.003 in the vicinity of the 
grain boundary phase. Aluminum nitride sintered body 

is produced by sintering a molded body of a raw 
material powder having aluminum and nitrogen as its 

principal components at a temperature of 1700 - 1900°C 
in a non-oxidizing atmosphere having a partial 

pressure of carbon monoxide or carbon of not more than 
200 ppm and then cooling the sintered body to 1500°C 

or a lower temperature at a rate of 5°C/min or less. 
The aluminum nitride sintered body has a greatly 

improved thermal conductivity and, therefore, is 

suitable for heat slingers, substrates or the like for 
semiconductor devices.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a method of manufacturing an aluminum nitride
(AlN) sintered body having an excellent thermal
conductivity.Aluminum nitride has very good electrical
insulation properties and a very high thermal
conductivity. For this reason, aluminum nitride
sintered bodies are used as a replacement for beryllia
(BeO) in power transistor heat slingers or the like,
as a replacement for alumina (Al2O3) in substrates or
packaging materials for semiconductor devices, and in
laser tubes, etc.Although the thermal conductivity of aluminum
nitride sintered bodies is far higher than that of
other ceramic materials, the thermal conductivity of
actual aluminum nitride sintered bodies industrially
produced does not exceed about half the theoretical
value of 320 W/mK. It is known that the thermal
conductivity of aluminum nitride sintered bodies
largely reduce when it contains impurities, such as
silicon or oxygen, in solid solution. Recently, due
to higher purity of the raw material powder and
improved sintering techniques, it has become possible
to obtain sintered bodies having a thermal 
conductivity of at most approximately 180 W/mK.However, even such conventional aluminum nitride
sintered bodies are still unsatisfactory in their
thermal conductivity and, with recent higher levels of
integration of IC and LSI, a need has emerged for heat
slingers, substrates, packaging materials or the like
with enhanced heat releasing properties for the use in
semiconductor devices. 
In the JOURNAL OF THE CERAMIC SOCIETY OF JAPAN,
Int.'l Edition, vol. 97, no.12, Dec. 1989, pages 1486-1493
the effect of microstructure on thermal conductivity
of ALN ceramics is discussed. High thermal
conductivities are achieved by sintering a long period of time.In view of the foregoing, it is therefore an
object of this invention to greatly improve the
thermal conductivity of an aluminum nitride sintered
body and thereby to provide a method of manufacturing an aluminum nitride
sintered body of high thermal conductivity suitable
for heat slingers, substrates, etc., for semiconductor
devices.According to the present invention, there is
provided a method of manufacturing an aluminum nitride sintered body
as defined in claim 1. FIG. 1 is a schematic view of the crystal
structure of an aluminum nitride crystal belonging to
the Wurtzite hexagonal crystal system. The solid line
indicates the unit lattice.FIG. 2 is photographs showing the crystal
structure of an aluminum nitride sintered body manufactured by
