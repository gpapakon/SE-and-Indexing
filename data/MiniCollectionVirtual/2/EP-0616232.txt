<ABSTRACT>
The radar allows selection of the received echo signals dependent on the range and radial velocity, using 2 stationary antenna (AA, AB) with partially overlapping cones (AKA, AKB). The echo signals (Fe) obtained from both the latter are correlated to determine the azimuth angle of each, detected vehicle (FZ1, FZ2) and hence its position. The transmitted signal (Fs) is provided by an oscillator (Gu) controlled by a sawtooth generator (SZG) and coupled to each antenna via a frequency divider (LT), the echo signals (Te) with the superimposed transmitted signal (Fs) handled via 2 separate channels (A, B) each with a rectifier (RDA, RDB) and a low-pass filter (TPA, TPB). The obtained frequency difference signals (SA, SB) are fed via A/D converters to a range filter bank providing orthogonal signal components for each range, characteristic spectral components, compared with a given threshold.

Traffic radar having at least one radar antenna
for illuminating the traffic area to be monitored and

having devices for selection of the received echo signals
on the-basis of range and radial speed, characterized

in that partially overlapping antenna lobes (AKA
and AKB) are formed by two radar antennas (AA, AB)

arranged in fixed positions, in that the azimuth angle
of respective vehicles (FZ1, FZ2, ..) is determined by

correlation of the echo signals (Fe) received by the
two antenna lobes (AKA, AKB), and the position is

determined from said azimuth angle, in that a sawtooth
generator (SZG) is used by an oscillator (GU) whose

frequency is controlled to produce a transmission signal
(Fs) which is supplied via a splitter (LT) to each

radar antenna (AA, AB), in that the respective received
signals (Fe), with the transmission signal (Fs) superimposed,

are rectified (RDA, RBB) in two separate
channels (A, B), are each passed to a low-pass filter

(TPA, TPB) and are supplied as respective frequency
difference signal (SA, SB) via an analogue/digital

converter (ADA, ADB) to a range filter bank (EFA, EFB),
in that the orthogonal signal components (Ex(1 to m)A,

Ey(1 to m)A and Ex(1 to m)B, Ex(1 to m)B,
respectively), which are present at the output of the

range filter bank (EFA, EFB) for respective range bands
(El to Em), are passed via a buffer store (ZSPA, ZSPB)

to a Doppler filter bank (FFTA or FFTB, respectively), 
which uses a Fast Fourier Analysis to determine

spectral components for each range band, which are
passed to a threshold comparison device (SWE) in which

the amplitudes (AMP) of all the spectral components are
compared with a predetermined threshold (SW), those

spectral components which are above the threshold being
passed to a signal angle processing device (SWV), in

that associated signals in the two channels are linked
to one another in the signal angle processing device

(SWV) and are used to determine respective angle
differences (WD1, WD2) and, on the basis of the

geometric arrangement of the radar antennas, respective
azimuth angles, and in that a track discriminator

device (SDE) is used to determine the corresponding
vehicle track (SP1, SP2) from the angle value, the

vehicle range and the vehicle speed.
Traffic radar according to Claim 1, characterized
in that the track for the individual vehicle

tracks is stored in tabular form, as a function of
range and azimuth angle, in the track discriminator

device.
Traffic radar according to Claim 1, characterized
in that the instantaneous position of the vehicle

on the road as well as the true speed are calculated
continually from the measurement variables of range,

azimuth angle, radial speed as well as the installation

height of the radar, or are read from tables.
Traffic radar according to Claim 1, characterized
in that the radar is installed at the edge of the

road.
