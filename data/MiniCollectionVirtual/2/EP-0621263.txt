<ABSTRACT>
An external anti-inflammatory and analgesic plaster 
preparation includes as an active ingredient a salt of 

diclofenac, 2[(2,6-dichlorophenyl)amino]benzene-acetic acid, 

with a cyclic organic having the general formula (I): 

wherein X is a group of the formula -(CH₂)m- in which m is an 
integer of 0 or 1 and n is an integer of 2 and a pH value of 

the preparation is adjusted to a range of 7.3 to 9.0.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to an external anti-inflammatory
and analgesic agent. More particularly, it is concerned with
an external anti-inflammatory and analgesic plaster preparation
wherein a salt of diclofenac with a cyclic organic base is
contained as an active ingredient and release and absorption
are remarkably improved.Where various non-steroidal anti-inflammatory and analgesic
agents are orally administered, an efficient drug
distribution in inflammatory sites is difficult to be achieved
and further undesirable side-effects could be produced in
gastrointestinal tracts in such diseases developed relatively
locally near body surface as arthritis, sarcitis, tenovaginitis
and the like.Accordingly, there have been developed in the field of
orthopedics ointments containing various non-steroidal agents
in order to avoid systemic side-effects and they have been
medicinally supplied as a practical pharmaceutical preparation.
Also, there have been proposed plaster preparations as another
pharmaceutical preparation having the same efficacy. The
plaster preparation could have many advantages not seen in the
ointments, such as prolonged effects, precise dosages, simple
administration, cooling effects on diseased parts by the free
water involved in the base and fixing effects on diseased parts
by the preparation. Presently, there have been supplied those
plaster preparations containing three sorts of non-steroidal
agents, indomethacin, ketoprofen and flurbiprofen and their
usefulness has been appraised. However, these agents have an 
extremely low solubility in water and thus it is essential to
add a specific drug solubilizer or solubilizing agent.On the other hand, Japanese Patent Kokai Koho No.
63-152372 discloses a salt of diclofenac with an organic cyclic
base and a pharmaceutical composition containing same, in which
it is reported that the pharmaceutical compositions containing
the diclofenac salt are effective as an anti-inflammatory and
analgesic for oral administration.Hitherto, there have been used external anti-inflammatory
and analgesic plaster preparations of a diclofenac type
containing diclofenac-Na salt as an active ingredient. Since
the diclofenac-Na salt has a low solubility to water so that
a skin permeability is reduced and therefore, a sufficient
pharmacological effect can not be obtained when applied to the
skin.For overcoming such disadvantages, there have been
provided various improvements in the external
diclofenac-containing plaster preparations. As disclosed in,
for example, Japanese
