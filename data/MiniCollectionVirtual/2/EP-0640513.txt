<ABSTRACT>
A safety-net arrangement (8) is provided, in the region between safety net (11) and the upper anchorage device (18) and/or between the safety net (11) and the lower anchorage device (18), with a length-compensation device (17) in the form of a fabric strip (25) in loops. In the case of a change in distance between the upper and the lower anchorage devices (18, 22) in the event of an accident, the stitching (29, 35) breaks and releases additional material in order thus to protect the safety net (11) against additional expansion in the longitudinal direction.

Safety net arrangement (8) serving to protect the passenger
compartment from the cargo space in estate cars,


with a safety net (8) defined by four longitudinal edges
(12, 13, 14, 15), wherein, in expanded state, one of its

longitudinal edges (12) extends beneath a vehicle roof and
approximately parallel to this, another longitudinal edge

(13) runs approximately parallel to a rear seat back, and
the remaining two longitudinal edges (14, 15) are

approximately parallel to the side walls of the automobile,
with a first attachment means (18), which is arranged on a
first longitudinal edge (12) and via which the safety net

(11) is detachably connected to the vehicle,
with a second attachment means (22), which is allocated to
a second longitudinal edge (13) running at least

approximately parallel to the first longitudinal edge (12)
and joins the safety net (11) to the vehicle,
with an expansion compensation arrangement (17) allocated
to the safety net (11), which is held compressed in its

resting state by means of a locking means (31, 34) and in
the case of tension peaks between the two attachment means

(18, 22) is changed from the compressed state into an at
least partially expanded state upon overcoming its locking

means (31, 34), and in some areas the safety net (11) has a
larger length between the attachment means (18, 22)

relative to its width.
Safety net arrangement according to Claim 1, characterised
in that the expansion compensation arrangement (17) extends

at least over a portion along the respective longitudinal
edge (12, 13). 
Safety net arrangement according to Claim 1, characterised
in that the expansion compensation arrangement (17) is only

provided on one longitudinal edge (12).
Safety net arrangement according to Claim 1, characterised
in that the expansion compensation arrangement (17) extends

over the entire length of the respective longitudinal edge
(12).
Safety net arrangement according to Claim 1, characterised
in that the expansion compensation arrangement (17) has a

flexible fabric (25), which is folded to form at least one
fold (29, 35).
Safety net arrangement according to Claim 5, characterised
in that the fabric (25) is a textile fabric.
Safety net arrangement according to Claim 6, characterised
in that the textile fabric (25) is a woven fabric.
Safety net arrangement according to Claim 5, characterised
in that the fabric (25) is a net.
Safety net arrangement according to Claim 1, characterised
in that the locking means is formed by a seam (31, 34).
Safety net arrangement according to Claim 9, characterised
in that the seam (31, 34) is a seam with an upper and lower

thread.
Safety net arrangement according to Claim 1, characterised
in that one attachment means is formed by a rod (18), which

extends along a longitudinal edge (12), and that the
expansion compensation arrangement (17) is located parallel

to this longitudinal edge (12) and extends between the 
safety net (11) and the attachment means (18).
Safety net arrangement according to Claim 1, characterised
in that one of the attachment means is formed by a wind-up

roller, to which the safety net (11) is secured at one
longitudinal edge (13).
Safety net arrangement according to Claim 1, characterised
in that two expansion compensation arrangements (17) are

provided, each on one of two longitudinal edges (12, 13)
running at least approximately parallel to one another.
Safety net arrangement according to Claim 5, characterised
in that the fabric is a strip (25) extending over the width

of the safety net (11), and said strip is preferably
secured at one of its longitudinal edges (26, 36) to the

safety net (11) by means of seams and, starting from there,
extends to the attachment means (18, 22), forms a loop (19)

there, and extends back to the safety net (11).
Safety net arrangement according to Claim 14, characterised
in that the loop (19) is fixed by means of a seam (32, 33)

running parallel to the longitudinal edge (12).
Safety net arrangement according to Claim 14, characterised
in that the safety net (11) is located between the two

layers (26, 36) of the strip (25) forming the expansion
compensation arrangement (17).
Safety net arrangement according to Claim 14, characterised
in that each layer (26, 36) of the strip (25) forming the

expansion compensation arrangement (17) contains a fan fold
(29, 35) extending over the entire length of the strip

(25), whereby the material of the fan fold (29, 35) is
folded inwards.
