<DESCRIPTION>
 Description Flavor EncapsulationTechnical FieldThe present invention relates to techniques to encapsulate materials which can undergo compositional changes in process and/or storage. Such encapsulation improves material shelf-life and usefulness in the preparation of products such as foods.Background of the InventionIt has long been recognized that it is desirable to encapsulate materials so as to protect them from volatilization, the degradation effects of oxygen and heat, moisture, internal and external molecular interactions and the like. Flavors are complex substances made up of multiple chemical components, some comparatively stable, some extremely volatile, others unstable to oxidation and reactive interactions and the like. Many flavorants contain top notes (i.e., dimethyl sulfide, acetaldehyde) , which are quite volatile, vaporizing at or below room temperature. These top notes are often what give foods their fresh flavors.Numerous techniques have been suggested and many commercialized for the encapsulation of flavors. However, all of these techniques suffer from one or more deficiencies. One of the most common techniques for encapsulating flavorants is spray drying. While this process directly produces a finely divided product which can be readily handled and used in the preparation of finished foods, spray drying suffers from several serious deficiencies. First, it is difficult to incorporate top notes into spray dried flavorants in an efficient manner. Inherent in spray drying is the loss of volatile materials . Furthermore, materials which are heat and/or oxygen sensitive are adversely affected by spray drying. The effect of heat, oxygen and volatilization can make a substantial change in the materials' composition, which in 

turn results in undesirable changes in flavor characteristics.Freeze-drying solutions of matrix materials containing either dissolved or dispersed flavors has also been used to produce encapsulated flavors. These methods generally result in losses of highly volatile components, and products having a foamy, porous structure.Yet another technique which has been employed is that of melt encapsulation of materials in carbohydrate matrices. In this application a carbohydrate melt is prepared and the encapsulate is added. The resulting solution is introduced into a quenching medium to produce a solid carbohydrate product containing the flavor. This technique while successful, is again, limited to comparatively high boiling point flavors because the carbohydrate solution is
