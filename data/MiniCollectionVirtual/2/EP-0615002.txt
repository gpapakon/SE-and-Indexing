<ABSTRACT>
A spendable anode for the anticorrosion 
protection of offshore structures, is constituted by a 

composite structure in which a first anodic material, 
which constitutes an external coating on the same 

anode carrier means, with said material having a more 
negative electrochemical potential than of the 

material which constitutes the offshore structure to 
be protected, is provided, in its turn, with an 

external coating constituited by a second anodic 
material the electrochemical potential of which is 

still more negative than of said first material. 
Furthermore, some types of anodic material, as well as 

a process for manufacturing such a spendable anode are 
specified.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a novel 
spendable anode for the anticorrosion protection of 
offshore structures, which anode, thanks to its 
particular composite-structure configuration, besides 
making it possible the necessary amount of anodic 
material to be decreased with self-explanatory 
economic advantages, also improves the protection 
state of the surfaces of the offshore structure, with 
protective compact deposits being formed in a larger 
amount. The present invention also relates to the process 
for accomplishing such a spendable anode. According to the prior art, the anticorrosion 
protection of offshore structures by means of 
spendable anodes represents today one of the most used 
techniques in this field, and its developments made it 
possible optimal anodic material from the viewpoints 
of efficiency and weight and cost savings to be found 
out, such as aluminum, zinc and magnesium alloys. According to such a technique, the spendable 
anode, made of an anodic material having a more 
negative electrochemical potential than of the 
material which constitutes the offshore structure to 
be protected, generates a bias which in its turn 
causes a protection current to be established, which 
causes protective calcareous deposits to be formed on 
the same strucuture.  Such a bias clearly is the higher, the more 
negative the electrochemical potential of the anodic 
material used. On the other hand, the above said necessary 
protection current for the adequate protection of the 
offshore structure depends, besides such marine 
conditions as temperature, salinity, oxygen content, 
and so forth, also, and above all, on the surface 
conditions of the offshore structure to be protected, 
i.e., whether calcareous deposits are present or less. 
From the above it results hence that during the early 
steps of the life time of the offshore structure to be 
protected, during which the protective calcareous 
deposits have not been adequately formed yet, the need 
exists for having the maximal protection current, 
which may then decrease during the subsequent life 
steps of the structure, as a function of the quality 
of the calcareous deposit formed during said initial 
step. From the above, it derives that an essential 
element in the design of any spendable anode is the 
ability of the latter to supply the high demand of 
starting protection current during the initial step of 
the life of the offshore structure, besides being 
capable of preserving the protection state of said 
structure throughout
