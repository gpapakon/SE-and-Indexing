<ABSTRACT>
The present invention relates to a magnetic device for the treating of water flowing in a conduit (1), which device can cause, during triaxial crystallisation of calcium bicarbonate, complete or partial conversion thereof into non-encrusting uniaxial aragonite crystal, comprising at least one pair of permanent magnets (2) arranged opposite on either side of the said conduit (1) along the same magnetic axis which coincides with a diameter of the same conduit (1), the said magnets (2) being held around the said conduit (1) by a fastening clamp (3), characterised in that the said magnets (2) are arranged in such a way that their opposite poles on either side of the conduit (1) have the same polarity and in that the fastening clamp (3) causes no magnetic short-circuit between the said magnets (2).

A magnetic device for the treatment of water
passing through a pipeline (1), comprising at least one

pair of permanent magnets (2) arranged facing one
another on either side of said pipeline (1) following

the same magnetic axis that is coincident with a
diameter of said pipeline (1), said magnets (2), being

held around the pipeline (1) by a fixing bracket (3),
and being arranged in such a way that their poles of

the same polarity are opposite one another,
characterised in that the magnets (2) are anisotropic

ferrite magnets chosen from among the oxonytes 290 or
the rare earths arranged in contact with the pipeline

(1) and magnetically insulated from it by a thin
coating chosen from among the epoxy paints or resins.
A device according to Claim 1, characterised in
that the poles of the magnets (2) facing one another

and arranged on either side of the pipeline are SOUTH
poles. 
A device according to either one of the
preceding Claims characterised in that the fixing

bracket (3) is a plastic collar.
A device according to either one of Claims 1 or
2 characterised in that the fixing bracket (3) is made

up of two cheeks (31-32) that come together to marry up
with the external shape of the magnets (2) and that

each has at least one part that opens out laterally
fitted with an element (4) that is suitable for co-operating

with the complementary element of the other
cheek so as to provide sufficient clamping of the

magnets (2) around the pipeline (1).
A device according to the preceding Claim
characterised in that the cheeks (31-32) are equally

well made of plastic or metal and that they comprise

two parts that extend laterally and which when they are
brought towards one another, without making contact, by

non-magnetic nuts (4-5) they cause the assembly to be
clamped.
A device according to any one of the preceding
Claims characterised in that the intensity of the

magnetic field can be adjusted by appropriate stacking
of extra detachable magnets (2) on one side and/or the

other side of the pipeline (1) to be treated in such a
way that the faces of said magnets that are in contact

are of opposite polarity so that they are automatically
held by their mutual attraction.
A device according to any one of the preceding
Claims characterised in that the shape of at least one

of the faces of the magnets (2) in contact with the
pipeline (1) is concave.
