A polypropylene laminate film comprises a crystalline 
polypropylene layer having laminated on at least one surface 

thereof a copolymer which is a random copolymer of propylene, 
ethylene, and an α-olefin having at least 4 carbon atoms.

using a catalyst system comprising (A) a solid catalyst 

component containing magnesium, titanium and a halogen, 
(B) an organoaluminum compound, and (C) an electron donative 

compound in substantially the absence of a liquid medium. 
The copolymer satisfies the following requirements: 


(1) ethylene content of 3.0 - 7.0 wt%, 
(2) α-olefin content of 2.0 - 6.0 wt%, 
(3) ethylene α-olefin ratio of at least 1.0, 
(4) melt flow rate of 10 g/10 minutes or less, 
(5) ratio of weight average molecular weight: 
number average molecular weight ratio of 4.5 or less, 
(6) mp of 135°C or less, and 
(7) n-hexane-soluble components less than 5.5 wt%

and hot tack properties, good transparency, and good blocking 

and solvent resistance.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a polypropylene
laminate film which has excellent low-temperature heat-sealing
and hot tack properties, good transparency, and
blocking and solvent resistance.Biaxially oriented crystalline polypropylene film
(BOPP) has been widely used as packaging film because of
its excellent rigidity, transparency and moisture-proof
properties, etc. However, since BOPP is not readily heat-sealable,
BOPP has hitherto been widely used in the form
of a laminate film obtained by laminating a resin having
excellent heat-sealing properties on one or both surfaces
thereof, or by co-extruding BOPP together with the resin
having excellent heat-sealing properties.Hitherto, the over-riding property demanded of the
heat-sealing resin has been the extent by which it could
decrease the heat-sealing temperature. In other words,
the low-temperature heat-sealing property has hitherto
been considered to be the most important. This is because,
if the heat-sealing temperature of the heat-sealing resin
could be decreased, the speed of making bags from the
laminate film will be increased and productivity improved.
On the other hand, such properties of the resin as its
transparency and blocking resistance are also important.However, more recently, the diversification of 
packaging techniques, that is the diversification of materials
to be packaged and the diversification of packaging machines
due to the diversification of the materials to be packaged
are rapidly increasing, and the hot tack property which
has not hitherto been regarded as so important for BOPP
has become as important as the low-temperature heat-sealing
property.Hitherto, various proposals have been made as to
the nature of the heat-sealing resins to be used in conjunction
with BOPP. For example, a propylene-ethylene copolymer
obtained by copolymerizing propylene and about 5% by weight
of ethylene is well known as a propylene-based heat-sealing
resin; however, although the copolymer has excellent transparency
and blocking resistance it has very poor low-temperature
heat-sealing properties. When the content of
ethylene in the copolymer is increased to improve the low-temperature
heat-sealing properties, the low-temperature
heat-sealing property is improved to some extent, but the
transparency and blocking resistance greatly deteriorate.A propylene-butene-1 copolymer obtained by copolymerizing
propylene and butene-1 is also well known. For
example, propylene-butene-1 copolymers obtained by polymerizing
in an inert solvent (so-called slurry
