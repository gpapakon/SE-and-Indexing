<ABSTRACT>
A differential printing process for textiles, in particular carpets, made of polyamide fibres of various dyeability, is characterized in that a cationic resist based on quaternary fatty amine polyglycol ethers or on quaternary ammonium polyglycols is added to the usual printing paste for polyamide fibres. The printing paste may also contain several different dyestuff types, as in the differential dyeing process, and may if required be continuously cross-dyed in a manner known per se in a single operation by a wet-on-wet differential dyeing process. To carry out this process, a usual printing paste for polyamide fibres is used which is characterized in that it contains a cationic resist based on quaternary fatty amine polyglycol ethers or quaternary ammonium polyglycols.

<CLAIMS>
A differential printing process of textiles made of polyamide fibers of various
dye affinity, characterized by


adding together 0.3 to 5 % by weight, based on the total printing paste
including water, of a cationic reserve based on quaternary fatty amine

polyglycol ethers and/or quaternary ammonium polyglycols and cationic and
anionic dyes to the usual printing paste for the printing of polyamide fibers,
wherein the printing paste contains several various types of dyes,
printing the textiles, and
then optionally cross-dyeing in the usual manner wet-in-wet by differential
dyeing process.
The process according to claim 1, characterized in that the textiles are
carpets.
The process according to claims 1 and 2, characterized by adding 0.5 to
1.5 % by weight of a cationic reserve to the printing paste.
The process according to claims 1 to 3, characterized by using a printing
paste having a pH-value between 3 and 6.5.
The process according to claim 4, characterized in that the printing paste
has a pH-value of 4.
Use of a printing paste in the differential printing process of textiles for
preparing of multicoloured dyeings, characterized in that the printing paste

contains together 0.3 to 5 % by weight, based on the total printing paste 
including water, of a cationic reserve based on quaternary fatty amine

polyglycol ethers and/or quaternary ammonium polyglycols and cationic and
anionic dyes.
The use according to claim 6, characterized in that the textiles are carpets.
The use according to claims 6 and 7, characterized in that the printing
paste contains 0.5 to 1.5 % by weight of a cationic reserve.
