<ABSTRACT>
The present invention pertains to a fluid aspiration-collection 
apparatus for aspirating and collecting a fluid into a suction 

chamber (3) through a fluid inlet (4) communicating with the 
suction chamber (3) in the case (14), and for discharging the 

fluid through a fluid outlet (5) after completion of fluid 
aspiration. A primary object of the present invention is to 

provide an apparatus which is simple in construction and is 
capable of aspirating the fluid at a constant pressure. The 

apparatus of the present invention comprises a case (14) having 
a suction chamber (3) formed, interior of which communicates 

with a fluid inlet (4) and a fluid outlet (5), a moving plate 
(9) constituting a part of a wall section of the suction 

chamber (3) and movably disposed within the case (14); and a 
cylinder (8) in which a piston (6) is airtightly and movably 

inserted and in which a vacuum chamber (7) is created by 
relative movement of the piston (6) or itself; the piston (6) 

and the moving plate (9) being connected to move together; the 
cross sectional area of the piston (6) being set smaller than 

the projected area (S₉) in the direction of movement of the 
moving plate (9); and the back side of the piston (6) and the 

moving plate (9) communicating with the atmosphere.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a fluid 
aspiration-collection apparatus for aspirating and 
collecting a fluid including a body fluid such as blood 
and lymph generated during medical treatment or surgery 
of injury and disease, blood and secreting fluid 
generated in a cavity after surgery, a physiological 
saline solution after flushing an operated part or an 
oral cavity, and a waste liquid including urine and 
stool. An aspiration-collection apparatus comprising 
an elastic, expansible bellows-type container is known in 
the prior art as disclosed in Unexamined Japanese 
Patent Publication No. Hei 2-261472. A method of 
using the container includes pre-compressing the 
container before use to extrude the air inside 
building up a negative pressure within a suction 
chamber in the container by utilizing an elastic 
restoring force of the container, sucking the liquid 
at a fluid inlet communicating with the suction 
chamber, and, after the collection of the fluid, 
compressing the container again to discharge the 
fluid filled in the suction chamber out at a fluid 
outlet.  In the bellows-type aspiration-collection 
apparatus, because the elastic restoring force of the 
bellows-type container increases on the contraction 
stroke and decreases on the expansion stroke, a 
relatively big negative pressure is created in the 
suction chamber during the initial period of 
aspiration; however, as the container sucks the 
fluid and expands, the suction pressure gradually 
decreases. That is, the aspiration-collection apparatus 
has the disadvantage that fluid aspiration can not be 
done at a constant suction pressure. There will occur various problems if the 
suction pressure varies. For example, when the 
aspiration-collection apparatus is used in medical 
treatment or surgery, exudation of blood and secreting 
fluid from an affected part will be accelerated under a 
high suction pressure. Also there will arise such a 
disadvantage that the tissue of internal organs will 
be sucked to the opening of an aspiration tube which 
is connected to a fluid inlet, resulting in tissue 
trauma. In the meantime, if the suction pressure is 
too low, it will be difficult to aspirate the fluid 
from the region where suction tube is inserted, 
resulting in delayed recovery of the affected part. 
Therefore, this type of fluid aspiration-collection 
apparatus requires a constant suction pressure. An apparatus having an inflatable-expansible 
balloon member in a rigid container is used as an  
 
apparatus capable of
