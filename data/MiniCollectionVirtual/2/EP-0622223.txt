<ABSTRACT>
To accommodate placement of both input and output 
media trays (54, 56) on the same side of the printer 

housing of an ink-jet printer (50) for 
operator convenience, a paper path with a direction reversal 

is employed. A paper preconditioning preheater (72) 
with a curved surface and a multi-purpose paper path 

component (70) accomplish the direction reversal. The 
paper path component is a unitary component which employs 

curved ribs (74A) to reduce the contact area with the 
medium and reduce static charge buildup, and has slots 

(74C) formed therein to release water vapor given off by 
the medium when preheated. The component permits paper to 

be loaded manually via a second manual feed path, through 
a housing, and upon opening a rear access door (64) in the 

housing, such component is easily removable to facilitate 
operator access to the paper path and electrical components.

<DESCRIPTION>
This application is related to the applictions filed on 
even date and entitled IMPROVED MEDIA CONTROL AT INK-JET 
PRINT ZONE, inventors: R.R. Giles et al., and DUEL 
FEED PAPER PATH FOR INK-JET PRINTER, inventors: R.R. 
Giles et al. This application is also related to 
European Patent Application EP-A-0568174 entitled 
HEATER BLOWER SYSTEM IN A COLOR INK-JET PRINTER, 
inventors B. Richtsmeier et al. The present invention relates to the field of ink-jet 
printers.  
 With the advent of computers came the need for devices 
which could produce the results of computer generated work 
product in a printed form. Early devices used for this 
purpose were simple modifications of the then current 
electric typewriter technology. But these devices could 
not produce graphics or multicolored images, nor could they 
print as rapidly as was desired. Numerous advances have been made in the field. The 
impact dot matrix printer is still widely used, but is not 
as fast or as durable as required in many applications, and 
cannot easily produce high definition color printouts. The 
development of the thermal ink-jet printer has solved many 
of these problems. Commonly assigned U.S. Patent No. 
4,728,963, issued to S.O. Rasmussen et al., describes an 
example of this type of printer technology. Thermal ink-jet printers employ a plurality of resistor 
elements to expel droplets of ink through an associated 
plurality of nozzles. In particular, each resistor element, 
which is typically a pad of resistive material about 
50µm by 50µm in size, is located in a chamber filled with 
ink supplied from an ink reservoir comprising an ink-jet 
cartridge. A nozzle plate, comprising a plurality of 
nozzles, or openings, with each nozzle associated with a 
resistor element, defines a part of the chamber. Upon the 
energizing of a particular resistor element, a droplet of 
ink is expelled by droplet vaporization through the nozzle 
toward the print medium, whether paper, fabric, or the 
like. The firing of ink droplets is typically under the 
control of a microprocessor, the signals of which are 
conveyed by electrical traces to the resistor elements. The ink cartridge containing the nozzles is moved 
repeatedly across the width of the medium to be printed 
upon. At each of a designated number of increments of this 
movement across the medium, each of the nozzles is caused 
either to eject ink or to refrain from ejecting ink according 
to the program output of the controlling microprocessor.  
 
Each completed movement across the

<CLAIMS>
An ink-jet printer (50) having a first housing side 
wherein medium input and output trays (54, 56) are located, and 

a media path is defined between said input and output trays 
through which a print medium (90) is passed during a printing 

operation, said path including a curved portion to change the 
path direction so as to pass said medium between said trays, 

characterised in that the printer further comprises media 
preheater (72) means for heating said medium to condition said 

medium for printing operations, and a media path component (70) 
comprising a series of curved ribs (74A) defining part of said 

curved media path portion, said medium contacting said ribs, and 
openings (74C) defined between said ribs for permitting moisture 

to escape from a print medium passing through said path. 
A printer according to Claim 1 wherein said ribs (74A) 
are aligned, spaced ribs. 
A printer according to Claim 1 or Claim 2, further 
characterized in that said openings (74C) comprises a series of 

elongated slots. 
A printer according to any preceding claim, wherein 
said preheater (72) defines a portion of said media path such 

that said medium passes between said preheater and said 
component (70) at said curved path portion. 
A printer according to any preceding claim, further 
characterized by a controller (200) and by means (166, 292) for 

advancing said medium through said media path in response to 
commands from said controller, and by a manual feed path for 

permitting an operator to manually feed a sheet of print medium 
into said printer, and wherein said component (70) further 

includes means for defining a portion of said manual feed path,  
 

said manual feed path converging at a path converging location 
(95) with said media feed path adjacent a print area. 
A printer according to Claim 5, wherein said housing
