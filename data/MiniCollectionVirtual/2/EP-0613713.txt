<ABSTRACT>
A horizontal wet scrubbing apparatus (1) for 
removing sulfur dioxide from hot flue gases has a 

horizontally disposed housing (3) through which the hot 
flue gases are passed, and at least one liquid injection 

manifold (27) vertically disposed therein and extending to 
adjacent a lower wall (11) of the housing for directing an 

aqueous scrubbing medium substantially parallel to the gas 
flow, and a flow deflection member (31) adjacent to, and 

downstream from the manifold. Aqueous scrubbing medium is 
collected in at least one reservoir (35) at the lower wall 

of the housing and recycled to the injection manifolds. 
The method provides for injection of aqueous scrubbing 

medium substantially parallel to the flue gas flow and 
subsequent deflection (31) of the gases, following the 

injection, by use of packing or baffles to provide intimate 
contact of the scrubbing medium with the gaseous stream.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an apparatus 
useful for removing sulfur dioxide from a flue gas streams 
and to a method for removal of sulfur dioxide from gaseous 
streams using a wet scrubbing process in a horizontal 
scrubbing unit. With the continuous increase of environmental 
controls over the discharge of certain gases, such as 
sulfur dioxide, into the atmosphere, the development of 
more efficient and economical means for removing such gases 
from flue gases has steadily continued. Especially in coal 
burning power plant systems for production of electricity, 
in many countries restrictions are applicable which require 
an ever increasing efficiency in removal of sulfur dioxide 
from flue gases. Sulfur dioxide removal systems are generally 
characterised as (a) dry scrubbing systems, where a 
solution or slurry of a reagent is dispersed in hot flue 
gases, with the water content thereof evaporated, and 
collection of relatively dry by-products made for disposal, 
or (b) wet scrubbing systems, where an aqueous solution or 
slurry of a reagent, such as an alkali or alkaline earth 
reagent is contacted with the gases, with collection and 
disposal of wet sludges. Dry scrubbing systems are generally classified into 
two categories. One is the dry sprayer or vertical reactor 
where the sorbent is dispersed into a flow of sulfur 
dioxide-containing flue gases, with optional removal of fly 
ash prior to the contact. The other is the dry sorbent 
injection method where a sorbent, with possible  
 
accelerators, is injected into a horizontal ductwork 
through which the gases are passed with dry solid reactants 
and excess sorbent removed from the gas prior to discharge 
to the atmosphere. The vertical reactor type dry system is 
suited primarily for use with the lower sulfur dioxide 
content gases and provides reasonable percentage removals, 
while the dry sorbent injection type dry system generally 
gives lower percentages of sulfur dioxide removal from the 
gases. Wet scrubbing systems have also evolved into two 
main categories, those using a vertical tower and those 
using a horizontal contactor. In the vertical tower 
scrubbing systems, gas is normally charged to the tower at 
a lower portion thereof and passes upwardly through the 
tower in contact with a countercurrently flowing dispersed 
aqueous scrubbing solution or slurry. Spaced contact trays 
may be provided in the tower to achieve better contact of 
the scrubbing medium and the gas, while a demister or 
liquid removal device is provided
