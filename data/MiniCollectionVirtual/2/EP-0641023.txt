<ABSTRACT>
A convertible cooling module, especially for use 

in conjunction with a wide range of computer systems 
ranging from workstations to massively parallel 

processors is employable with both air and water 
cooling systems. In particular, a cooling module is 

convertible from a heat sink modality to an air cooling 
modality, and finally to a liquid cooling modality in 

response to either increased performance demands or an 
increase in the number of processors or circuit 

components employed. The conversion may be carried out 
in the field and provides a flexible and less costly 

upgradeability path for computer customers.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention is generally directed to a
cooling module which is especially useful for either
air or water cooling of electronic circuit components,
particularly those used in computer systems. More
particularly, the present invention is directed to a
flexible cooling system for a range of computer systems
extending from workstation devices to massively
parallel processing system complexes. Even more
particularly, the apparatus of the present invention
provides increased thermal flexibility and cooling
upgradeability to computer installations at lower cost,
with greater reliability and without the necessity of
system down time.It has been the trend in customer workstation
installations to link a number of computer systems
together. Typically, these can take the form of a
Local Area Network (LAN) to facilitate cooperative work
between the users and to ensure the maximum utilization
of each computer system. Additionally, in some
installations groups of workstations are being linked
together to form loosely coupled parallel processing
machines. In the limit, large numbers of workstation
processors may be packaged together to form massively
parallel supercomputer systems. It is therefore seen
that one of the trends in the computer industry is the
combination of sub-assemblies of electronic circuit
boards into larger systems. Accordingly, it is seen
that it is very desirable that these sub-assemblies be
configured to facilitate their use in workstations,
workstation clusters and also in massively parallel
machines. However, the cooling requirements for these
various systems are very different. Nonetheless, it
would still be desirable to have a cooling methodology
which extends across this whole range of computational 
devices, which is relatively inexpensive to implement
and yet which provides flexible and field upgradeable
systems.One of the possibilities for cooling advanced
processor circuit modules is the employment of arrays
of parallel plates (fins) which may be employed as heat
sinks. Heat generated in an electronic component is
conducted into the plates and dissipated through the
passage of a forced flow of ambient air within high
aspect ratio flow channels between the fins. In future
machines, as power levels per module increase, the
combined heat dissipated by many machines in a confined
work space, whether they are independent or part of a
large LAN, could exceed the capacity of the room air
conditioning system in which the systems are placed.
In this case, it would be desirable if the

A convertible cooling module (10) in combination with a first shroud and a second shroud, for fluid
cooling of electronic circuit components, said

module comprising:

a base plate (14);

a plurality of thermally conductive plates (11)
affixed to one side of said base plate, said plates

being disposed parallel to one another, whereby a
fluid flow path through said conductive plates is

defined;
a circuit module carrier (22) coupled to the opposite
side of said base plate to form a sealed enclosure

with said base plate with said opposite side in
thermally conductive contact with caps of circuit

modules within said enclosure;
flow path divider plate means (12) disposed
substantially perpendicularly to said plates (11) so

as to define at least two distinct fluid flow
paths through said plates;
the cooling module (10) being adapted for receipt of
two different shrouds (30, 40), either a first shroud

(40) for directing liquid flow in one direction in one
of the fluid flow paths and in the other direction in

the other of the fluid flow paths, or a second shroud
(30) for directing air flow in the same direction in

both the fluid flow paths; wherein 
said first shroud (40) and said second shroud (30)
comprise means for attaching one of the two shrouds to

the convertible cooling module (10) and whereby said
convertible cooling module is adaptable for use in

varying thermal load conditions.
The cooling module of Claim 1 wherein said second shroud
is disposed at least partially around said plates, said

shroud including air moving means disposed at one end of
said flow paths and wherein said shroud is open at the

other end of said flow paths.
The module of Claim 1 in which said conductive plates
comprise material selected from the group consisting of

copper and aluminum.
The module of Claim 1 in which said shrouds include a
flat mating portion which is sealably affixable to said

base plate.
The module of Claim 1 further including thermally
conductive paste disposed between said base plate and

said caps of circuit modules.
The module of Claim 2 in which said air moving means
comprises a fan.
The module of Claim 2 in which there is present a second
air moving means at the open end of said second shroud.
The module of Claim 2 in which said second shroud comprises a
polymeric material.
