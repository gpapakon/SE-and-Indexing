<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a composition
comprising 2-(thiocyanomethylthio)-benzothiazole
(TCMTB) on a solid, preferably inert, carrier in
powdered form, which powdered TCMTB is particularly
useful as a pesticide. The invention also relates to a
process for the preparation of such compositions of
powdered TCMTB, and processes for the use of such
powdered TCMTB compositions. More particularly, the
invention relates to a process for the preparation of a
powdered TCMTB composition, particularly a stable
powdered TCMTB composition, formulations containing
such a composition and uses of these formulations,
particularly as pesticides.Various physical forms of pesticides are
formulated for different reasons. These forms include
emulsifiable concentrates (EC), wettable powders (WP),
aqueous suspensions (AS) or flowables (F), water
dispersible granules (WDG) or dry flowables (DF),
granules, solutions (S), microcapsules, microemulsions
and dusts. Each of these forms has advantages and
disadvantages that are well-known to one skilled in the
art.The compositions of the invention can be used as
pesticides, defined herein to include, for example,
insecticides, herbicides, rodenticides, fungicides,
algaecides, acaricides, molluscicides, nematocides, and
plant growth regulators.Emulsifiable concentrates have been the most
popular form of pesticides used in the agricultural
industry. Since most pesticides are not water soluble, 
it has been necessary to find a suitable solvent to
dissolve the pesticide and an emulsifier to emulsify
the solution. The resulting solution can be diluted
with a large amount of water to form a macroemulsion
for application, for example, to agricultural products.
However, one of the challenges in forming emulsions is
that water of different degrees of hardness may be
used, and the temperature may differ depending upon the
time of day or year of the application.The thermal stability of a pesticide as a
homogeneous dispersion in water is critical for
its efficacy. Emulsifiable concentrates are
advantageous in that they are easy to manufacture and
use, but they can suffer from the disadvantages of
flammability, phytotoxicity, environmental pollution
and odor problems.TCMTB is a broad spectrum, effective fungicide
which has primarily been used as an emulsifiable
concentrate in various industrial applications.
Emulsifiable concentrates have generally involved a
solvent as a necessary ingredient.Organic solvents are most commonly used for
dissolving TCMTB, since water can cause crystallization
