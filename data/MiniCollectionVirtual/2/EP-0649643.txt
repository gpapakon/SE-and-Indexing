<ABSTRACT>
The present invention provides an article, comprising: a fabric sheet 
which has been compacted using a heat shrink yarn; and a curable or 

hardenable resin coated onto the fabric sheet. The present invention involves 
compacting a fabric sheet to impart stretchability and conformability to the 

fabric while minimizing undesirable recovery forces. Suitable fabrics for 
compacting are fabrics which comprise fiberglass fibers which are capable of 

first being compacted and then being set or annealed in the distorted, state. 
The article may be in the form of an orthopedic bandage and may optionally 

contain a microfiber filler associated with the resin.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to sheet materials coated with a curable or
hardenable polymeric resin. More particularly, this invention relates to a
curable or hardenable resin coated sheet material useful in preparing an
orthopedic bandage.Many different orthopedic casting materials have been developed for
use in the immobilization of broken or otherwise injured body limbs. Some of
the first casting materials developed for this purpose involve the use of plaster
of Paris bandages consisting of a mesh fabric (e.g., cotton gauze) with plaster
incorporated into the openings and onto the surface of the mesh fabric.Plaster of Paris casts, however, have a number of attendant
disadvantages, including a low strength-to-weight ratio, resulting in a finished
cast which is very heavy and bulky. Furthermore, plaster of Paris casts
typically disintegrate in water, thus making it necessary to avoid bathing,
showering, or other activities involving contact with water. In addition, plaster
of Paris casts are not air permeable, thus do not allow for the circulation of
air beneath the cast which greatly facilitates the evaporation and removal of
moisture trapped between cast and skin. This often leads to skin maceration,
irritation, or infection. Such disadvantages, as well as others, stimulated
research in the orthopedic casting art for casting materials having improved
properties over plaster of Paris.A significant advancement in the art was achieved when polyisocyanate
prepolymers were found to be useful in formulating a resin for orthopedic
casting materials, as disclosed, for example, in U.S. Pat. No. 4,502,479
(Garwood et al.) and U.S. Pat. No. 4,441,262 (Von Bonin et al.). U.S. Pat.
No. 4,502,479 sets forth an orthopedic casting material comprising a knit 
fabric which is made from a high modulus fiber (e.g., fiberglass) impregnated
with a polyisocyanate prepolymer resin which will form a polyurea.
Orthopedic casting materials made in accordance with U.S. Pat. No.
4,502,479 provide significant advancement over the plaster of Paris orthopedic
casts, including a higher strength-to-weight ratio and greater air permeability.
However, such orthopedic casting materials tend not to permit tactile
manipulation or palpation of the fine bone structure beneath the cast to the
extent possible when applying a plaster of Paris cast. In this regard, knit
fiberglass materials are not as compressible as plaster, and tend to mask the
fine structure of the bone as the cast is applied, e.g., the care provider may be
limited in "feeling"

<CLAIMS>
A method of making an orthopedic casting bandage, comprising
the steps of


knitting a high modulus yarn fiberglass yarn and a stretched elastomeric yarn to form a
fabric;
releasing the tension on the elastomeric yarn as the knit fabric comes
off the knitting machine;
vibrating the fabric thereby compacting said fabric;
heat setting said compacted fabric thereby removing said elastomeric
yarn; and
coating said fabric with a curable or hardenable liquid resin.
The method of claim 1,

wherein said high modulus yarn comprises fiberglass and said elastomeric
yarn is made from fibers selected from the group consisting of synthetic

elastomers made from: polybutadiene; polychloroprene; polyisoprene;
polyurethane; copolymers of chloroprene and other monomers; copolymers of

a diene and styrene; copolymers of a diene and acrylonitrile; copolymers of
styrene and acrylonitrile; copolymers and block copolymers of styrene and

butadiene; copolymers and block copolymers of styrene and isoprene;
terpolymers of styrene, butadiene and isoprene; and ethylene propylene

elastomers such as copolymers of ethylene and propylene and terpolymers of
ethylene, propylene and a diene; and natural elastomers made from natural rubber.
The method of any preceding claim,

wherein said elastomeric yarn has a denier between 200 and 600.
The method of any preceding claim,

wherein said elastomeric yarn is knit into said fabric as a lay-in. 
The method of any preceding claim,

wherein said elastomeric yarn is knit into said fabric as a single needle in-lay
every 3 to 4 wales.
The method of any preceding claim,

wherein said sheet has from about 25 % to about 100 % extensibility in the
elongated direction when a 2.63 N load or force is applied across a 1 cm

section of the fabric.
The method of any preceding claim,

wherein said curable resin is selected from the group consisting of water-curable
resins comprising isocyanate-functional prepolymers; water-curable

resins comprising a water-reactive liquid organometallic compound and an
organic polymer; and alkoxysilane terminated polyurethane prepolymer resins.
The method of any preceding claim,

wherein said curable resin is a water-curable resin comprising isocyanate-functional
prepolymers.
The method of any preceding claim,

wherein said fabric has between about 6 and 70 openings per square cm when
measured under a load of 7.63 N/cm width.
The method of any preceding claim,

wherein said fabric was compacted to between about 20 and 50 percent of its
original dimension.
The method of any preceding claim,

wherein said fabric is vibrated using a beater bar comprising a plurality of
bars attached to a hub. 
A method according to any preceding claim further comprising the step
of:


collecting said compacted fabric prior to said heat setting step using a
center supported surface winder.
A method according to any preceding claim, wherein said coating
operation causes less than 0.05 N/mm width tension to be applied to said

fabric.
