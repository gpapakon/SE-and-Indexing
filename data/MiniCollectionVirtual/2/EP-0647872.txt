<ABSTRACT>
The present invention is in the field of retardation layers, more 
particulary in the field of retardation layers based on super-twisted 

nematic (STN) liquid crystalline layers. The retardation layers 
according to the invention are characterized in that, the liquid 

crystalline polymer is placed between glass substrates of which at 
least one has a thickness of 20 - 500 micrometers. The use of said 

thin glass substrates reduces the weigth and thickness of the 
retardation layer. 
The LC polymer film may also be placed between the substrate of the 
display cell and a thin glass substrate. In a further embodiment of 

the invention the LC polymer film is placed between the polarizer and 
a thin glass substrate. In these embodiments of the invention a second 

thin glass substrate is not necessary and the thickness and weigth of 
the retardation layer is further reduced.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention is in the field of retardation layers comprising 
a twisted nematic liquid crystalline polymer film, more particulary in 
the field of retardation layers based on super-twisted nematic (STN) 
liquid crystalline layers. Said retardation layers are described in 
EP-A1-0 565 182 and EP-A3-0 380 338. For further explanation of 
retardation layers reference may be had in these patent publications. 
In theory STN retardation layers can fully compensate the optical 
effects that occur in STN display cells. For this reason, STN 
retardation layers are regarded to be superior compared to uniaxially 
stretched polymer films. The required thickness of liquid crystalline polymer (LCP) STN 
retardation layers is depending on the birefringence of the LCP 
approximately 5-9 micrometers. Due to this low thickness of the LCP 
layer in general a suitable substrate (carrier) is used. Up till now, 
thick glass substrates (0,7 mm) are used for low molecular twisted 
nematic material. When used as retardation layers in D-STN-LCP, the 
use of said thick substrates has several drawbacks. The substrates are 
heavy and their use results in thick retardation layers. The retardation layers according to the invention are characterized in 
that, the liquid crystalline polymer is placed between glass 
substrates of which at least one has a thickness of 20 - 500 
micrometers. Liquid crystalline polymers have a higher mechanical strength than low 
molecular material. Therefore, glass substrates having a thickness of 
20-500 micrometers instead of thick glass substrates may be used. By 
liquid crystalline polymers is meant: liquid crystalline polymers, 
liquid crystalline glasses and crosslinked liquid crystalline 
polymers.  On the thin glass substrates a polyimide orientation layer may be 
coated, cured and rubbed in the appropriate direction. A liquid 
crystalline polymer may be placed between the glass substrates having 
both a polymide orientation layer. The PI alignment layers can be replaced by other methods of inducing 
orientation e.g. oblique evaporated SiO. The tilt of the uniform 
planar boundary conditions can be adjusted if necessary by the type of 
orienting layer and/or the used method of rubbing. The twisted 
retardation layer preferrably possesses the same retardation value (Î”n 
X d), an equal twist angle and an opposite twist direction compared to 
the liquid crystalline display cell. The retardation layer has to be 
transparent and colourless. Additional requirements include thermal 
stability,
