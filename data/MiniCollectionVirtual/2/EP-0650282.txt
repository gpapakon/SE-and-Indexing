<ABSTRACT>
A radiotelephone handset (1) having a tubular telescoping 
antenna and a 

flip-open mouthpiece (3) is provided with a mechanical coupling 
between the 

mouthpiece and the antenna for automatically extending the antenna when the 
mouthpiece is opened. In another embodiment, the mouthpiece is slidably mounted 

for automatically extending the channel.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to antennas, particularly to antennas for use on
radiotelephone handsets, and most particularly to mechanisms for the automatic
deployment and retraction of antennas for use on radiotelephone handsets.Radiotelephone handsets are becoming quite ubiquitous, particularly in the form of
portable cellular telephones. Such a telephone typically has a retractable mouthpiece
and a retractable antenna so that the telephone is as compact as possible when not in
use, enabling it to be carried conveniently.To use such a telephone, a user must deploy the mouthpiece and deploy the
antenna. If a user has his hands full or is preoccupied he may perform these operations
in a slipshod manner, thus using the telephone with the antenna partially or completely
retracted.As is known in the prior art, such telephones are capable of operating at several
different power levels, and of adjusting themselves to operate at the lowest feasible
power level in order to conserve battery power. If the telephone is used with its antenna
not fully deployed it may be forced to adjust itself to operate at a higher power level than
necessary, thus increasing battery drain. Also, such operation may shorten the life of
internal components by causing them to operate under strenuous conditions.Such telephones are often subjected to rough handling. A user may neglect to
retract the antenna when he finishes using the telephone; subsequent rough handling
may damage or break the antenna.The reader is referred to WO-A-93 01659.According to the present invention, there is provided a radio telephone handset as
defined in claim 1.It is a general object of the present invention to provide improved radiotelephones.It is a particular object of the present invention to provide a radiotelephone having
a retractable mouthpiece and a retractable antenna with a mechanism coupling the
mouthpiece to the antenna for automatically deploying the antenna when the
mouthpiece is deployed.In one embodiment of the present invention there is provided a cellular telephone
where the microphone is on a mouthpiece which is slidably mounted on the body of the
telephone; in order to use the telephone a user must slide the mouthpiece down the
body, thus establishing an appropriate relative position 
between the speaker and the microphone and exposing a keypad located on the body
of the telephone. The antenna is of the telescopic type, with a rod-type antenna
plunger slidably installed in a hollow cylindrical antenna channel. Abutting the
lower end of the
</DESCRIPTION>
<CLAIMS>
A radiotelephone handset (1) of the type having a mouthpiece (3) movable
relative to a body (2) of the handset (1), 
characterised by
:

an antenna (9) slidably movable within a channel (8) associated with the body (2);
and
a mechanical coupling (11) between the mouthpiece (3) and the antenna (9)
responsive to the movement of the mouthpiece (3) relative to the body (2) to cause the

antenna (9) to move within the channel (8).
A handset (1) according to claim 1, wherein

   the mouthpiece (3) is hinged to the body (2), and wherein the mechanical coupling
(11) is responsive to a user's act of opening and/or closings of the hinged mouthpiece

(3).
A handset (1) according to claim 2, wherein a flexible wirelike member (10) has
one end slidably inserted in the second end of said channel (8), has the said one end

fastened to the antenna (9), and has the other end of the member (10) protruding from
the channel (8) and fastened to the mouthpiece (3).
A handset (1) according to claim 3, wherein the antenna channel (8) is curved
near its second end with substantially the same curvative as the wirelike member (10)

would have if it were free and in an unstressed condition, whereby the member (10) is
confined by the channel (8) from buckling when stressed by opening of the mouthpiece

(3).
A handset (1) according to claim 1, wherein the mouthpiece (3) is slidably
mounted to the body (2), and wherein the mechanical coupling (11 ) is responsive to the

user's act of sliding the mouthpiece (3) relative to the body (2).
A handset (1) according to claim 5, wherein the mechanical coupling (11)
comprises a pinion (14) rotatably mounted in the body (2), a first rack on a part of the

mouthpiece (3) adjacent to the body (2) and in engagement with the pinion (14), and a
second rack (110) in engagement with the pinion (14) and fixed relative to the antenna

(9). 
A handset (1) according to claim 6, wherein the second rack (110) is flexible and
enters one end of the said channel (8), and wherein the said one end is adjacent to the

pinion (14) whereby the second rack (110) is confined by the channel (8) to prevent
buckling of the second rack (110).
A handset (1) according to any one preceding claim, wherein the channel (8) is
tubular and fastened to the body (2), and the antenna (9) is rodlike and slidably mounted

within one end of the tubular channel (8).
