<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a microcapsule 
for heat-storing material which is used for 
cooling or heating a substance or for maintaining a 
substance at a constant temperature. More particularly, 
the present invention relates to a microcapsule for 
heat-storing material which has a good fluidity under 
any temperature condition and a high stability over an 
extensive period of time, and can retain latent heat at 
a high density. The microcapsule for heat-storing 
material of the present invention can be utilized as a 
heating and cooling medium for air conditioning, or it 
can be utilized as a portable high-temperature insulation 
material or low-temperature insulation material by 
holding in any of various packaging materials and 
containers. A heat-storing material most generally used 
every day is water. Water is used for high-temperature 
or low-temperature insulation usually in the form of hot 
water or ice and can be said to be the most inexpensive 
heat-storing material in daily life. In general, as compared with a method  
 
utilizing only sensible heat which does not accompany 
the phase transitions of a substance, a method of heat 
storage by utilization of latent heat accompanying the 
phase transitions has the following advantage. In this 
method, since a large quantity of thermal energy can be 
stored at a high density in a narrow temperature range 
including the melting point, the volume of a heat-storing 
material can be reduced, and moreover the heat 
loss can be kept small because no large temperature 
difference develops, considering the large quantity of 
heat stored. As a heat-storing material in which there is 
utilized latent heat accompanying phase transitions, in 
particular, phase transitions between liquid and solid, 
any heat-storing material can be used so long as it has 
a melting point or freezing point. There is preferably 
used a heat-storing material which is physicochemically 
stable and absorbs heat of fusion of 20 kcal/kg or more 
in practical application. The following materials are 
generally known as typical heat-storing materials. 
(1) Inorganic compounds containing a large 
amount of water of crystallization, for example, calcium 
chloride hexahydrate, sodium sulfate decahydrate, sodium 
hydrogenphosphate dodecahydrate, sodium thiosulfate 
pentahydrate, and nickel nitrate hexahydrate. (2) Organic compounds, for example, aliphatic 
hydrocarbons such as tetradecane, pentadecane, cyclohexane, 
etc.; aromatic hydrocarbons such as benzene,  
 
naphthalene,
