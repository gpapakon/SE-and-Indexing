<DESCRIPTION>
This invention pertains to blends of post-chlorinated 
polyvinyl chloride (CPVC) and chlorinated polyethylene 
(CPE), and methods for making extruded rigid profiles from 
the blends and exhibiting smooth satin surface appearance. Combinations of polyvinyl chloride and chlorinated 
polyethylene are established in the art, for example, 
flexible wire and cable cladding. Blends of PVC and 
chlorinated polyethylene are recognized as contributing 
both impact modifying characteristics as well as ease of 
melt processing. Chlorinated polyethylene is not 
particularly efficient when utilized as the sole impact 
modifier with PVC, hence an amount needed to boost notched 
Izod Impact strength to at least about 10 lb.-ft./inch 
notch will lead to appreciable loss in rigidity, measured 
as tensile of flexural modulus. There have been suggested graft copolymers of 
chlorinated polyethylene and PVC. Ludwig Beer, in 1962 
suggested in U.S. Patent No. 3,268,623 that improvements in 
properties could be obtained by dissolving CPE in vinyl 
chloride monomer and suspension polymerizing to yield an 
improved combination compared to mechanical blending of the 
two resins.  In U.S. Patent No. 4,481,333 Fleisher et al. disclosed 
the combination of PVC, CPE, and fluoropolymer. There it 
was taught that if prior to combining with PVC, 
fluoropolymer and CPE are first combined, a 10-fold lesser 
quantity of fluoropolymer (PTFE) provided the same 
magnitude of reduction in extruder torque compared to a 
ternary mixture. Hankey disclosed in Canadian Patent No. 636,534 that 
on the addition of 19 weight parts of CPE "per 100 weight 
parts of PVC" (phr), room temperature notched Izod impact 
strength improved to 24 ft.-lb./ inch notch. Hankey showed 
that at this level of CPE, the flexural modulus of PVC was 
lowered from 400,000 psi to 270,000 psi, while in a 
combination 5 parts of CPE, 5 parts of a rubbery diene type 
polymeric impact modifier and 90 parts of PVC, room 
temperature notched Izod impact was comparable but rigidity 
was not sacrificed to the same degree. The samples 
demonstrated were milled and compression molded, with no 
teaching to extrusion characteristics. Frey and Klug disclosed in U.S. Patent No. 3,940,456 
that extruded PVC blends with chlorinated high pressure 
polyethylene may, in certain instances, exhibit coarseness, 
i.e., rough extrusion characteristics. They proposed to 
solve this problem by employing a CPE which had been 
chlorinated in the presence of a finely-divided silicic 
acid and siloxane
