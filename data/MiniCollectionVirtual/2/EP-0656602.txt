<ABSTRACT>
The present invention provides an image pattern 
identification/recognition method which enables the 

reduction of the work load of the user required in the case 
of incorrect character recognition, as well as facilitating 

the addition of a new recognition pattern in the dictionary 
so that the pattern can be identified and added thereafter. 

A binary image pattern which has been entered is compared to 
each of the binary mask patterns prepared in advance for 

each of the recognition categories so as to 
identify/recognize the binary pattern and to determine the 

recognition category to which the binary pattern belongs. 
The binary image pattern is identified as belonging to the 

first recognition category if the black portions of the 
binary image pattern are contained in the black portions of 

the binary mask pattern of the first recognition category 
and if the black portions of the binary image pattern are 

contained only in the double black portions between the 
binary mask pattern of the first recognition category and 

that of the second recognition category.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a binary (black and
white) image pattern identification/recognition method.In a conventional character recognition processor and
an image recognition processor including a kanji (Chinese-character-reading)
OCR (Optical Character Reader), some
distinctive features of Chinese characters and other symbols
are selected from characters and image patterns in the form
of vectors to be compared to reference pattern vectors in
each of the categories in a standard dictionary created in
advance so as to be able to perform discriminant functions
such as those detecting similarity or distance, thus
identifying the most similar character or image pattern as a
result.Conventional character recognition systems widely use
the so-called "structural feature" which corresponds to
character line structures such as line direction, connection
relationship, and positional definition. However, in the
case of specially designed characters having an unusual
texture, unclear characters, or images which cause
significant background noise, the "structural feature" is
significantly distorted, which significantly degrades the
accuracy of recognition. Moreover, simple degree of similarity (hereafter,
referred to as "similarity degree") is also known as a
discriminant function based on the number of black pixels
common to a binary image entered and the reference pattern
vectors (also represented in a binary pattern) of each
category in the standard dictionary prepared in advance (see United States Patent No 5 121 444).
However, this method has a problem in that specially
designed characters having an unusual texture or images
having significant background noise may be incorrectly
identified as a category having more (or a larger number of)
black pixels among the reference pattern vectors.That is, the conventional OCR technology or other
recognition technologies are not free from the problem that
specially designed characters, unclear characters,
characters having significant background noise or reverse
contrast characters (white characters against a black
background) cannot be recognized correctly.The object of the present invention is to provide an
image pattern identification/recognition method capable of
processing specially designed characters, unclear
characters, significantly-modified characters, or a
character string containing reverse contrast characters.An aspect of the present invention provides a method as
follows. If black portions of a binary image pattern which
has been entered correspond

<CLAIMS>
An image pattern identification/recognition method,
wherein an input binary image pattern is compared to each of

binary mask patterns corresponding to each of pre-created

recognition categories so as to determine the recognition
category to which said binary image pattern belongs; characterized

in said method comprising:

a first procedure (101,102,110) for
identifying said input binary image pattern as belonging to

a first recognition category if all portions of a color of said input
binary image pattern are contained in portions of the same color

contained in a binary mask pattern of said first recognition
category and if said portions of said input binary

image pattern are contained not only in portions of the same color
which are common to said binary mask pattern of said first recognition category

and a binary mask pattern of a second recognition category; and
a second procedure (102,120)
for rejecting said input binary image pattern if

said input binary image pattern does not belong to any
recognition categories based on said first procedure and if

said portions of said input binary image pattern
correspond only to portions common to said binary

mask pattern of said first recognition category and said
second recognition category.
An image pattern identification/recognition method as claimed in Claim 1, 
characterized in that said

image pattern identification/recognition method comprises:

a third procedure (101,103) for obtaining:

a first match degree based on a total number of
black pixels common to said binary image pattern and said

binary mask pattern at a plurality of predetermined
positions,
a second match degree based on a total number of
white pixels common to said binary image pattern and said

binary mask pattern at said plurality of predetermined
positions,
a first mismatch degree based on a total number of
combinations of white pixels of said binary image pattern

and black pixels of said binary mask pattern at a plurality
of predetermined positions,
a second mismatch degree based on a total number of
combinations of black pixels of said binary image pattern

and white pixels of said binary mask pattern at a plurality
of predetermined positions,
a third match degree based on a product of said first match
degree and said second match degree,
a third mismatch degree based on a product of said first mismatch
degree and said second mismatch degree, and
a similarity degree between said binary image
pattern and said binary mask pattern, based on said third

match degree and said third mismatch degree; and
a fourth procedure (103) for recognizing that said binary
image pattern belongs to the recognition category having the

maximum of said similarity degree.
An image pattern identification/recognition method
as claimed in Claim 2, wherein said plurality of

predetermined positions covers all the positions in said
pattern.
An image pattern identification recognition method as claimed in claim 2, wherein
said

image pattern identification/recognition method comprises:

a fifth procedure for presetting a threshold value
for each of said binary mask patterns of said recognition

category; 
and instead of the fourth procedure
a sixth procedure (102,110) for identifying said binary image
pattern as belonging to the recognition category if said

similarity degree between said binary image pattern and the
binary mask pattern of the corresponding recognition

category obtained in said eleventh procedure exceeds the
threshold value of said binary mask pattern only for a

single recognition category.
An image pattern identification/recognition method
as claimed in Claim 4, further comprising:

   a seventh procedure (102, 120) for rejecting said input binary image
pattern if said input binary image pattern does not belong

to any of the recognition categories according to said
eighth procedure and if said similarity degree between said

binary image pattern and the binary mask pattern of the
corresponding recognition category obtained in said third

procedure exceeds the threshold value of said binary mask
pattern. 
An image pattern identification/recognition method
as claimed in one of Claims 1 through 5, further comprising

a eighth procedure for creating, adding, or updating a binary
mask pattern through repeated learning based on data on

black or white portions of said input binary image pattern
by using a predetermined similarity degree.
