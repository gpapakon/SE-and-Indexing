<ABSTRACT>
So that several non-textured threads may be more easily and safely drawn in when the texturing device is started, a drawing-in thread guide (5) guides the thread(s) to be drawn into the transport channels of the texturing nozzle (1) and into the wad channels of the wad transport roller (2) in a sensibly parallel direction to said channels and at a predetermined distance from each other.

<CLAIMS>
A method for the continuous texturing of a thread, 
or of several threads extending parallel, from a 

thermoplastic material by means of a texturing 
nozzle (1) with at least one conveyor duct, at 

least one spinneret opening (11) and a thread 
guide (12) arranged at the entrance, a plug 

conveying roller (2) with at least one pair of 
lateral plug guiding means (21), at least one plug 

detaching means (3) and a plug cooling means (4), 
characterized in that during the start each 

untextured thread to be drawn in is guided by the 
first thread guide (12) and by a draw-in thread 

guide (5, 5.1, 6) in such a way that it is placed 
in a centered manner on the plug conveying roller 

(2) between the lateral plug guide means (21). 
A method as claimed in claim 1, characterized in 
that the untextured thread is guided by the first 

thread guide (12) and the draw-in thread guide (5, 
5.1, 6) for all possible thread courses between a 

course (F.2) on a tangent from the first thread 
guide (12) to the cylinder envelope surface formed 

by the lateral guide means and a course (F.4) in 
which the thread extends over a sector of the plug 

conveying roller and to a second thread guide 
(13). 
A method as claimed in claim 1 or 2, characterized 
in that during the drawing-in by the first thread 

guide (12) the untextured thread is guided by the 
draw-in thread guide (5, 6, 5.1) and additionally 

by guide grooves (22.1, 22.2, 22.3) on the plug 
conveying roller (2).  

 
A method as claimed in one of the claims 1 to 3, 
characterized in that the draw-in thread guide (5, 

5.1) is stationary and the untextured thread is 
guided in a guide slot (58). 
A method as claimed in one of the claims 1 to 3, 
characterized in that the draw-in thread guide (6) 

is moved during the drawing-in process and the 
untextured thread is guided by a guide pin (60) 

and a feeding portion (61) or by a guide pin 
provided with grooves. 
An apparatus for the continuous texturing of a 
thread, or of several threads extending mutually 

parallel, from a thermoplastic material according 
to the method as claimed in claim 1, with said 

apparatus having a texturing nozzle with at least 
one conveyor duct, a first thread guide (12) 

arranged in the zone of the entrance of the 
conveyor duct and at least one spinneret opening 

(11), a plug conveying roller (2) with at least 
one pair of lateral guide means (21), at least one 

plug detaching means (3) and a plug cooling means 
(4), characterized in that for drawing in the 

thread(s) during the start the apparatus is 
provided with a draw-in thread guide (5, 5.1, 6). 
An apparatus as claimed in claim 6, characterized 
in that the draw-in thread guide (5, 5.1) is 

arranged in a stationary manner at least partly 
about the circumference of the plug conveying 

roller (2) and distanced therefrom, and is 
provided with at least one guide slot (58) for 

guiding the thread(s). 
An apparatus as claimed in claim 7, characterized 
in that the draw-in thread guide (5, 5.1) is  

 
provided with a feeding zone (55) which is 

arranged on the side of a tangential plane, which 
is averted from the plug conveying roller (12), 

from the first thread guide (12) to the cylinder 
env
elope surface formed by the outer 
circumferences of the lateral guide means (21), a 

guide zone (56) downstream of the feeding zone 
(55) extending towards the plug detaching means 

(3) with at least one guide slot (58) and a plug 
pass-through zone (57) with at least one plug 

pass-through aperture (52) arranged in the zone of 
the plug detaching means (3), with one guide slot 

(58) each opening out into a pass-through 
aperature (52). 
An apparatus as claimed in claim 8, characterized 
in that each guide slot (58) continues on the 

opposite side of the plug pass-through aperture 
(52). 
An apparatus as claimed in claim 8, characterized 
in that the draw-in thread guide is designed and 

arranged in such a way that its distance from the 
circumference of the plug conveying roller is 

irregular. 
An apparatus as claimed in claim 6, characterized 
in that the draw-in thread guide (6) is provided 

with a guide pin (60) which is arranged parallel 
to the axis of the plug conveying roller (2) and 

distanced from its circumference and is 
operatively connected with a drive in such a way 

that it is movable about a part of the 
circumference of the plug conveying roller during 

the draw-in process.  
 
An apparatus as claimed in claim 11, characterized 
in that the guide (60) is associated with a 

feeding part (61). 
An apparatus as claimed in claim 11, characterized 
in that the guide pin (60) is provided with at 

least one guide groove. 
An apparatus as claimed in one of the claims 6 to 
13, characterized in that the plug conveying 

roller (2) is provided with one guide groove (22) 
each between the lateral guide means (21) parallel 

thereto.
