<ABSTRACT>
An enteral nutritional product for a person having a neurological injury is very low in carbohydrate, but high in fat. The fat is supplied by a lipid blend having a ratio of n-6 to n-3 fatty acids in the range of 1 to 6. Preferably the nutritional product contains nutrients having antioxidant properties, for example beta-carotene, vitamin E, vitamin C, taurine, molybdenum and selenium.

<DESCRIPTION>
 NUTRITIONAL PRODUCT FOR PERSONS HAVING A NEUROLOGICAL INJURYFIELD OF THE INVENTIONThe present invention relates to a nutritional product for persons having a neurological injury, such as from trauma to the head.BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTIONThe phenomena of head injury is well described in "Intensive Management of Seven Head Injury", Borel et al , CHEST. July, 1990, pages 180-189, at page 181. Cerebral injuries may be of either the penetrating or non- penetrating varieties, both of which cause damage to the brain and vasculature structures. Secondary injury to the brain indicates a vicious circle of escalating injury. Cerebral injury causes cerebral edema, cerebral edema raises intracranial volume which increases intracranial pressure, raised intracranial pressure compresses brain tissue and decreases cerebral perfusion pressure further increasing cerebral injury. Decreases in cerebral perfusion pressure result in cerebral blood flow falling below the level necessary to prevent neurologic ischemia and cell injury. When compartmental pressure gradients are established by local areas of injury, transcompartmental herniation of brain tissue results in catastrophic neurologic injury.Nutritional support of the patient with a neurological injury is a complex problem. Patients with a severe head injury are hypermetabolic and catabolic, and they require early and intensive nutritional support to minimize malnutrition-related complications. Nutritional support may, however, adversely affect neurological recovery. Experimental studies have shown that hyperglycemia due to glucose infusion or to the postprandial state worsens neurological recovery from cerebral and spinal cord ischemia. The mechanism of this detrimental effect is not completely understood, however, in many studies hyperglycemia has been associated with increased accumulation of lactic acid. Development of a diet which would supply protein and caloric needs without adversely affecting neurological recovery would have widespread use in patients with central nervous system ischemia or trauma. 

 Glucose tolerance of critically ill patients receiving nutritional support is an important concern of nutritional support personnel. Several studies have demonstrated that injured and critically ill patients have increased rates of glucose production and glucose oxidation which are not easily suppressed by exogenous glucose administration. It has been demonstrated that accelerated gluconeogenesis can not be reduced by administration of exogenous glucose at rates
