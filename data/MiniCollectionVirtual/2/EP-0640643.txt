<ABSTRACT>
An organopolysiloxane which generates intramolecular or 
intermolecular cross-linking based on dipole-dipole 

interaction, hydrogen bonding or ion bonding, and which is 
not ruptured or plastically deformed at an extension ratio 

no more than 15% at a temperature of 20°C under relative humidity 
of 65%; and a method of setting hair using the same. Hair which 

is set by the method retains the given shape over time, and 
the organoplysiloxane imparts a soft touch to the hair.

 
In addition, the shape given by the setting treatment can be 

easily restored to the original shape by ordinary shampooing.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to novel
organopolysiloxanes and to a method of setting hair using
the same. More particularly, the invention relates to
organopolysiloxanes which are excellent in the hair setting
performance and the hair set retentivity, which provide
soft touch to the set hair, which have good removal-by-shampoo
property, and which are useful as an effective
component in hair setting compositions, and to a method
of setting hair using the same.People make their hair styles in different manners.
Generally, hair styles are made by applying a hair setting
agent to dry or towel-dried hair, then giving hair a desired
form with or without drying the hair naturally or with a
drier. Hair setting agents which are generally used in this
method are in the forms of foam, spray, mist, lotion, cream,
gel, etc. Another method of making a hair style is to apply
a hair setting agent in a spray or mist form to the hair
which has been given shape by curlers and the like, and to
maintain the given shape. In both methods, hair setting
agents are required to have a function that maintains the
finished hair style over time. In addition, good sensation 
free from roughness and stickiness is desirable.Conventional hair setting agents generally contain
film-forming setting polymers, examples of which include
polyvinylpyrrolidones, vinylpyrrolidone - vinyl acetate
copolymers, acrylic ester - methacrylic ester - acrylic acid
copolymers, methylvinyl ether - maleic anhydride copolymers
and copolymers of methacrylic esters (compounds in which
dialkylaminoethyl methacrylate and monochloroacetic acid are
bonded to each other).Hair setting agents containing these film-forming
setting polymers have a drawback that the formed hair style
collapses as time passes. Especially, when the humidity is
high, the shape of the set hair is easily lost.The main reason which explains the lost of shape is
that the setting polymer which is bonded to hair fibers is
deformed over time. In highly humid conditions, the polymer
plasticizes by absorbing humidity and thus easily gets
deformed to shorten the set retention.Therefore, setting polymers having high elasticity have
been conventionally used to avoid easy deformation.
However, such polymers involve a drawback in that the hair
treated with them results in a stiff and rough texture, which is
undesirable. In order to improve the touch to the hair, hair
setting agents generally contain a variety of sensation improvers
such as silicone oils, modified silicones and oil agents, which
