<ABSTRACT>
A multi-layer packaging film comprising layers having 
varying degrees of cross-linking when subjected to electron 

beam (EB) radiation. The outer layer has a high degree of 
cross-linking to improve the adhesion, strength, toughness and 

heat resistance of the film and the inner layer has a low 
degree of cross-linking to improve the sealability. Bags made 

from the multiple layer films are especially useful for shrink 
packaging, and particularly for shrink packaging of meats 

having large cavities.

<DESCRIPTION>
Heat shrinkable polymer films have gained
substantial acceptance for such uses as the packaging of
meats and other articles of food. This description will
detail the usage of films for packaging meat; it being
understood that these films are also suitable for packaging
other products such as frozen foods and cheeses. Some of
the films embodying this invention are normally used as heat
shrinkable bags supplied to the meat packer with one open
end, to be closed and sealed-after insertion or the meat.
After the product is inserted, air is normally evacuated,
the open end of the bag is closed, such as by heat sealing,
or applying a metal clip, and finally heat is applied, such
as by hot water, to initiate film shrinkage about the meat.In subsequent processing of the meat, the bag may
be opened and the meat removed for further cutting of the
meat into user cuts, for retail sale, for example, or for
institutional use.Successful shrink bags must satisfy a multiplicity
of requirements imposed by both the bag producer and the bag
user. Of primary importance to the bag user is the
capability of the bag to survive physically intact the
process of being filled, evacuated, sealed closed, and heat
shrunk. The bag must also be strong enough to survive the 
material handling involved in moving the contained meat,
which may weigh 45.4 kg (100 pounds) or more, along the distribution
system to the next processor, or to the user. Frequently,
the meat will have protruding bones that will puncture
shrink bags that are not sufficiently strong. Thus, the bag
must be strong enough to physically protect the meat.It is also highly desirable to the bag user that
the bag serve as a barrier to infusion of gaseous material
from the surrounding environment. Of particular importance
is provision of an effective barrier to infusion of oxygen,
since oxygen is well known to cause spoilage of meat.The bag producer requires a product which can be
produced competitively while meeting the performance
requirements of the user. Thus, the bag material should be
readily extrudable, and susceptible to cross-linking by
irradiation, with sufficient leeway in process parameters as
to allow for efficient film production. The process should
also be susceptible to efficient extended production
operations. In the irradiation process, the film produced
must have improved strength while the inner layer maintains
sufficient sealability.It is important to users of shrink bags that once
the meat or other food article is placed in the bag, the bag
can be heat

<CLAIMS>
An irradiated multiple layer polymeric film comprising:

(a) an outer protective layer comprised of a blend of from 80%
to 90% ethylene vinyl acetate and from 10% to 20% of a

material selected from ultra low density polyethylene, low
density polyethylene, linear low density polyethylene, very

low density polyethylene and ionomers, and;
(b) an inner heat sealant layer made of different polymer to that
of the outer protective layer, and which comprises a

copolymer comprising at least 50 % ultra low density
polyethylene, low density polyethylene, linear low density

polyethylene, very low density polyethylene, or ionomers,

wherein said inner heat sealant layer has a dose level of incipient

cross-linking higher than the dose level of incipient cross-linking of
said outer protective layer, said film being irradiated at a dose level

between 1.5 and 10 megarads such that at a given radiation dose
level said outer protective layer undergoes more cross-linking than

said inner heat sealant layer.
A multiple layer film according to claim 1 wherein said heat sealant
layer is comprised of from 80% to 100% of a material selected

from ultra low density polyethylene, low density polyethylene,
linear low density polyethylene, very low density polyethylene or

ionomers. 
A multiple layer film according to claim 1 or claim 2 further
comprising a barrier layer disposed between said inner heat sealant

layer and said outer protective layer.
A multiple layer film according to claim 3, including a first
protective-adhesive layer disposed between said inner heat sealant layer and

said barrier layer; and a second protective-adhesive layer disposed between
said outer protective layer and said barrier layer.
An irradiated multiple film according to Claim 4 wherein said inner
heat sealant layer is comprised of at least from 50% to 100% of a

material selected from ULDPE, VLDPE, LDPE, LLDPE and
ionomers.
An irradiated multiple layer film according to Claim 5 wherein said
first protective-adhesive layer is comprised of a blend of from 50%

to 100% EVA resin and from 0% to 50% of a material selected
from ULDPE, LDPE, LLDPE, VLDPE and ionomers.
An irradiated multiple layer film according to Claim 6 wherein said
second protective-adhesive layer is comprised of at least from 50%

to 100% of a material selected from ULDPE, LDPE, LLDPE,
VLDPE and ionomers.
A multiple layer film according to any of the preceding Claims
wherein said barrier layer is a polyvinylidene chloride copolymer.
A multiple layer film according to Claim 8 wherein said
polyvinylidene chloride copolymer is a copolymer of

polyvinylidene chloride and methylacrylate. 
A multiple layer film according to any one of the preceding Claims
wherein said barrier layer is ethylene vinyl alcohol.
An irradiated multiple layer him according to any preceding claim
wherein said film is subjected to from 2 MR to 10 MR of

irradiation.
An irradiated multiple layer film according to any preceding claim
wherein said film is oriented and subjected to from 2 MR to 10 MR

of irradiation.
A heat shrinkable bag made from an irradiated multiple layer film
according to any preceding claim.
