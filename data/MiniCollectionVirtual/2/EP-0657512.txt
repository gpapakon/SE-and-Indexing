<ABSTRACT>
A method of making a drawing media which can be 
applied to a substrate in which the drawing media is 

prepared by mixing together a pigment, a binder and an 
organosilicon compound. The organosilicon compound is a 

volatile, low viscosity methylsilicone fluid which is either 
a cyclic silicone polymer or a short chain linear silicone 

polymer. The silicone containing drawing media is applied 
to the substrate and the drawing media is allowed to dry on 

the substrate.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention is directed to a pastel drawing media
which contains an organosilicon compound. The presence of
the organosilicon compound in the drawing media as an
ingredient, results in the smoother application of the
medium, easier blending of colors on the substrate and the
elimination of the need for applying a fixative to the
completed drawing.The artists in the twentieth century have at their
fingertips a wide variety and selection of drawing media
from which to choose. Some representative types are
charcoal, conte' crayon, colored pencil, graphite pencil,
color markers, pastel, pen and ink, acrylics, oils, water
colors and gouache. Pastels themselves come in a wide
variety of consistencies including soft pastel chalk, oil
pastel, pastel pencil and neopastel crayon.Chalk pastels, which typically contain pigment,
precipitated chalk and gum tragacanth, apply very smoothly
to the drawing substrate. Once applied, individual colors
are readily blended. The blending ability of chalk pastels
is essentially unlimited. Soft pastels and other forms of
drawing media containing a minimum amount of binder require
the application of a fixative to the substrate during the
painting process in order to fix the drawing media and the
image to the substrate. Due to the nature of the drawing
media, lack of a fixative would cause the drawing media to
rub off easily. To prevent this from occurring, the artist
using charcoal, graphite pencil or pastel drawing media,
sprays a fixative solution containing glue or resin lightly
over the picture.Works of art in pastel and other friable materials
such as charcoal and graphite pencil, are known to be 
inherently unstable. The pastel medium consists of dry
pigment particles held together with a binder. The sole
function of the binder, which is typically gum tragacanth,
is to hold the pigment particles together in order to form a
stick. The stick is used to apply the pastel pigments to
the paper substrate. The pastel particles have a natural
tendency to flake off from the paper substrate. Virtually
any condition, such as vibration of the piece during travel
or extensive handling, affects the weak forces holding the
particles to the substrate, resulting in damage to the piece
and loss of pigment.The use of a fixative, however, has not been found
to be advantageous for a number of reasons, including the
fact that once the fixative is applied to the work, the
fixative cannot be removed without total destruction of the
work. Application of a fixative further causes undesirable
chang
