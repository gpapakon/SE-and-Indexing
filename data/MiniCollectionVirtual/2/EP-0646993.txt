<ABSTRACT>
A cam lever locking mechanism is provided for an 
electrical connector assembly (10) which includes a lever 

(16) pivotally mounted on a first connector (12). The 
lever has an eccentric cam (30) for engaging a cam follower 

(32) on a second connector (14) for providing a mechanical 
advantage while mating the connectors on a mating axis (34) 

generally centrally of the connectors, in response to 
rotation of the lever. The lever (16) is rotatable about 

a pivot axis (20) transverse to and generally intersecting 
the mating axis (34) of the connectors. The eccentric cam 

(30) on the lever (16) is aligned generally with the mating 
axis (34) of the connectors. The cam follower (32) on the 

second connector (14) is located generally on the mating 
axis (34).

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates
to a cam lever
mechanism for mating and unmating a pair of connectors or a
connector and another part.Electrical connectors are used in a variety of
applications for making large numbers of electrical
interconnections. A connector typically includes two
components: a housing or other body member and a plurality of
terminals or electrical contact elements mounted on the
housing. A connector may be attached to the end of a multiconductor
cable, and a second connector may be mechanically
and electrically interconnected to a printed circuit or wiring
board, or both connectors may be attached to cables or both
connectors may be interconnected to a pair of boards.
Regardless of the application, electrical connectors often are
difficult to mate or interconnect when they mount a large
number of terminals. In addition, some connector assemblies
may be sealed assemblies, with the seal means making it
difficult to mate the connectors.Consequently, a variety of devices have been
designed for assisting the mating process. Document DE-A-1
465 732 discloses a device using a forked lever and a spring
element both mounted on one surface of a first connector to be
mated with a second counter connector. The first connector and
the spring element have through openings which can be aligned
by biasing the spring element by means of the forked lever. An
alignment pin fixed with one end to the second connector can
pass the aligned through openings. When the forked lever is
released, the pin is got catched by the relaxing spring
element so that the second connector is pulled toward the
first connector into a mating condition. By actuating the
forked lever again the through openings are aligned and the
alignment pin is pushed back by means of a hook or shoulder
provided at the forked lever until the connectors are unmated.
However, high frictional forces during the mating and unmating 
procedure, for example, cause a premature material fatigue of
the spring element. Another typical device or mechanism is
a cam lever mechanism, such as those shown in
US-A-5,035,634,
US-A-5,135,410
US-A-5,174,785
and US-A-5,230,635.All of the above-referenced patents show examples of
cam lever mechanisms of the prior art, wherein mating
connectors are provided with levers having camming surfaces,
the lever being mounted on one of the mating connectors such
that a camming surface engages a projection located an the
outside of the second mating connector. The projection defines
a cam follower and usually projects laterally
