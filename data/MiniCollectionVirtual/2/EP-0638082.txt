<DESCRIPTION>
 MACROCYCLIC IMMUNOMODUL ATORSThis application is a continuation-in-part of copending United States patent application Serial No. 07/755,208, filed September 5, 1991.Field of the InventionThe present invention relates to novel chemical compounds having immunomodulatory activity, and in particular to macrolide immunosuppressants. More particularly, the invention relates to semisynthetic analogs of ascomycin, means for their preparation, pharmaceutical compositions containing such compounds and methods of treatment employing the same.Background of the InventionThe compound cyclosporine (cyclosporin A) has found wide use since its introduction in the fields of organ transplantation and immunomodulation, and has brought about a significant increase in the success rate for transplantation procedures. Unsatisfactory side- effects associated with cyclosporine, however, such as nephrotoxicity, have led to a continued search for immunosuppressant compounds having improved efficacy and safety.Recently, several classes of macrocyclic compounds having potent immunomodulatory activity have been discovered. Okuhara et al., in European Patent Application No. 184162, published June 11, 1986, disclose a number of macrocyclic compounds isolated from the genus Streptomyces. Immunosuppressant FK-506, isolated from a strain of S. tsukubaensis , is a 23-membered macrocyclic lactone represented by formula la, below. Other related natural products, such as FR-900520 (lb) and FR-900523 (lc), which differ from FK-506 in their alkyl substituent at C-21, have been isolated from S. hygroscopicus yakushimnaensis. Yet another analog, FR-900525, produced by S. tsukubaensis, differs from FK-506 in the replacement of apipecolic acid moiety with a proline group.FR-900520, also known as ascomycin, has been previously disclosed by Arai et al. in U.S. Patent No. 3,244,592, issued April 5, 1966, where the compound is described as an antifungal agent. Monaghan, R.L., et al ., on the other hand, describe the use of ascomycin as an immunosuppressant in European Patent Application No. 323865, published July 12, 1989.Although the immunosuppressive activity of FK-506 has been clinically confirmed, toxicity in mammals has limited its utility. The activity of FK-506 has, however, prompted efforts to discover novel analogs of FK-type compounds which possess superior properties. These efforts include the isolation of new fermentation products, the microbial transformation of existing chemical entities, the chemical modification of these macrocycles,
