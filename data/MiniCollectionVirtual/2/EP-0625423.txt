Printing unit of a rotary printing machine,
having a frame (22), a first printing-unit cylinder (14),

whose one end is rotatably mounted in a first support
(50) mounted movably on the frame (22), a second

printing-unit cylinder (16), which is rotatably mounted
in a second support (52) mounted on the frame (22), and

having means (140) for engaging the first and second
printing-unit cylinders (14, 16) against one another and

disengaging the said cylinders from one another, having
a skewing device (180) for adjusting the angular position

of the two printing-unit cylinders (14, 16) relative to
one another, which skewing device has an eccentric hub

(65) which can be rotated about a skewing axis (170) by
skewing means (181 to 188) and in which the first support

(50) is mounted so as to be rotatable about a disengagement
axis (66) by the engagement and disengagement means

(140), characterized in that a supporting means (84) with
a supporting surface (190) is provided, on which the

first support (50) is mounted in such a way that it moves
in a direction running transversely to the skewing axis

(170) in sliding contact with the supporting surface
(190) when the hub (65) is rotated
.
Apparatus according to Claim 1, characterized in
that the first support (50) has a surface (64) which

abuts the supporting surface (190), at least one of these
two surfaces (64, 190) being curved in such a way that

the first support (50) moves on a circular path which is
centred relative to the axis of rotation (76) of the

second printing-unit cylinder (16).
Apparatus according to Claim 1 or 2, characterized 
in that the supporting means (84) comprise wedge

arrangements (80, 82) which are configured to be moveable
back and forth between the first and the second supports

(50, 52), and by means of which the contact pressure
between the first and the second printing-unit cylinders

can be adjusted in the printing position.
Apparatus according to Claim 3, characterized in
that the wedge arrangements (80, 82) can be displaced by

means of threaded rods (86, 90).
Apparatus according to one of the preceding
claims, characterized in that the first and second

printing-unit cylinders (14, 16) are configured without
bearer rings.
Apparatus according to one of the preceding
claims, characterized in that a fourth printing-unit

cylinder (20), mounted in a fourth support (56), is
provided below the second printing-unit cylinder (16),

and a third printing-unit cylinder (18), mounted in a
third support (54), is provided below the fourth

printing-unit cylinder (20), the third support (54) being
pivotable about a lower disengagement axis (100), and the

fourth support (56) being pivotable about an intermediate
disengagement axis (110) into respective engagement and

disengagement positions.
Apparatus according to Claim 6, characterized in
that the engagement and disengagement means are formed by

an adjusting cylinder (140) and an associated piston rod
(142) which engage on the first support (50) and on the

third support (54) and pivot them in such a way that,
when the piston rod (142) is retracted, the printing-unit

cylinders (14, 16, 18, 20) are in the engagement position
and, when the piston rod (142) is extended, are in the

disengagement position.
Apparatus according to Claim 7, characterized in
that the third and fourth printing-unit cylinders (18,

20) are moved into the disengagement position under the
effect of gravity when the piston rod (142) is being

extended.
Apparatus according to Claim 7 or 8, characterized 
in that limiting means (130, 160) are provided

which, when the piston rod (142) is being extended, limit
the downward movement of the third and/or fourth

printing-unit cylinders (18, 20) when the latter have
reached the disengagement position
