A transporting system has: a pair of left and 
right guide rails (1A, 1B); a transporting electric car 

(2) supported by and running along the rails; a driving 
system (9) to drive the electric car; and a power supply 

system (10) for the driving system. The driving system 
is composed of a secondary conductor (16) horizontally 

secured to one of the guide rails (1B) and a linear motor 
body (17) installed in the electric car. The power 

supply system (10) is composed of: a pair of induction 
wire lines (21) serving as a non-contact power source 

secured to and along the other guide rail (1A); and 
induction coils (22) intervening therebetween, with the 

induction wire lines being disposed horizontally, side by 
side and in parallel with each other, and the induction 

coil being fixed to and carried by the electric car, so 
that the automobile electric car operates in a more 

reliable manner, more quietly, faster and more effectively 
to keep clean the environment around it.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a transporting system of
the type as specified in the preamble of claim 1, and to a
trnasporting system installed in an automatic warehouse.A transporting system of the type mentioned hereinabove
is known from US-A-7,766,993.More generally, in a conventional type of a transporting
system for transportation of goods or cargos, 
a shelving-and-unshelving and transporting electric
car travels on rails which are installed along a car
passage between adjacent racks forming for example an
automatic warehouse. Generally in the driving system
employed in the known transporting systems, an electric
motor drives wheels of the transporting electric
car of the so-called traction wheel type. The contact
type power supply system for the electric car consists of
an electric feeder line extending along the car passage
and a collecting unit carried by the car so as to be in a
sliding contact with the feeder line.In the described transporting systems, the
driving system of traction wheel type and the contact
type power supply system have caused some problems. For 
example, the electric car will inevitably make a considerable
noise when it moves, though the car cannot run
fast. Due to dusts produced by such a supply system,
and/or other obstacles, it often fails to ensure a smooth
and constant supply of electric current to the car.To diminish the noise and raise the running speed of
the electric car, it may be possible to employ the driving
system of a certain linear motor type. A linear
motor body in this system will be mounted on and fixed to
the electric car, with a secondary conductor cooperating
with the linear motor body being secured along the car
passage. This motor body must always be separated a
predetermined small distance from the secondary conductor.
However, abrasion of outer peripheries of wheels
and/or any obstacle intervening between any running wheel
and the passage surface will result in a variation in the
effective height of the electric car or particularly of
the linear motor body. In such an event, the predetermined
distance could not be maintained constant, or
the linear motor body would come into a direct contact
with the secondary conductor, if the worst happens.Alternatively, the aforementioned drawbacks inherent
in the prior art systems may be resolved in another
way. An induction wire line ( e.g., the so-called
Lits wire ) as a non-contact type power source may be
installed in and along each car passage, with at least
one induction coil being carried by the car.
