<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a method for making 
a formed laminate and also relates to the resultant 
formed laminate made by the method. Slab stock foam has previously been compressed 
to provide greater strength such as for carpet padding, 
to control size of cells such as for use as a filtering 
media, and to provide localized compressed areas such as 
for reinforcement for fasteners. Such prior art and 
other foam prior art are disclosed by United States

United States Patent 4,061,822 Brodnyan et al discloses 
a method for making a formed laminate comprising 
applying a foam onto a flexible sheet (leather or 
leather substitute), crushing the foam coating to  
 
reduced thickness, and embossing and curing the crushed 
foam coated sheet. Wearing apparel, which is one use for which 
the present invention has particular utility, often has 
designs, logos etc. printed, dyed or sewn onto the 
article which can be a T-shirt, sweater, etc. However, 
heretofore there has not been any great acceptance of 
processing for forming wearing apparel with a formed 
shape that enhances the article of apparel. One object of the present invention is to 
provide an improved method for making a formed laminate. In carrying out the above object, the method 
for making a formed laminate in accordance with the 
invention is performed by positioning a flexible sheet 
adjacent first and second contoured mold surfaces and 
providing a quick reacting foamable liquid mixture 
adjacent the contoured mold surfaces for reaction that 
causes full expansion in less than 25 seconds to provide 
a foam which subsequently cures in less than 20 minutes

A method for making a formed laminate 
(20), comprising: 


positioning a flexible sheet (28) adjacent 
first and second contoured mold surfaces (44,46); 
providing a quick reacting foamable liquid 
mixture (50) adjacent the contoured mold surfaces 

(44,46) for reaction that causes full expansion in less 
than 25 seconds to provide a foam (51) which 

subsequently cures in less than 20 minutes at room 
temperature without any heating but which, after 

substantial completion of the expansion and before 
substantial curing has taken place, has a transitory 

state when the liquid mixture (50) is viscous and 
defines cells enclosing gas generated during the 

expansion stage of the reaction; and 
providing relative movement of the first and 
second contoured mold surfaces (44,46) toward each other 

to compress the foam (51) and the flexible sheet (28) 
between the first and second contoured mold surfaces 

(44,46) during the foam reaction while the foam (51) is 
in said transitory state to form the flexible sheet (28) 

and provide a collapsed foam layer (30) that is bonded 
to the flexible sheet (28) as the formed laminate (20). 
A method for making a formed laminate 
(20) as in claim 1 wherein the flexible sheet (28) 

utilized is selected from the group consisting of porous 
cloth (28a), vinyl (28b) and leather (28c). 
A method for making a formed laminate 
(20) as in claim 1 wherein the flexible sheet (28) 

utilized is a porous cloth (28a) and includes a barrier 
coating (78) that prevents the foamable liquid mixture 

(50) from permeating the cloth (28a).  
 
A method for making a formed laminate 
(20) as in claim 1 wherein a film (56) is positioned in 

a vertically spaced relationship to the flexible sheet 
(28) and the foamable liquid mixture (50) is received 

therebetween for the reaction that causes the expansion 
to provide the foam (51). 
A method for making a formed laminate 
(20) as in claim 4 wherein the film (56) is positioned 

below the flexible sheet (28) and receives the foamable 
liquid mixture (50) for reaction and consequent 

expansion. 
A method for making a formed laminate 
(20) as in claim 5 wherein the flexible sheet (28) is 

porous cloth (28a) and includes a barrier coating (78) 
that faces downwardly to prevent the foam (51) from 

permeating the cloth (28a). 
A method for making a formed laminate 
(20) as in claim 4 wherein the flexible sheet (28) is 

positioned below the film (56) and receives the foamable 
liquid mixture (50) for reaction and consequent 

expansion. 
A method for making a formed laminate 
(20) as in claim 7 wherein the flexible sheet (28) is 

porous cloth (28a) and includes a barrier coating (78) 
that faces upwardly to prevent the foamable liquid 

mixture (50) from permeating the cloth. 
A method for making a formed laminate 
(20) as in any preceding claim wherein a cloth layer 

(32) is laminated to the collapsed foam layer (30) 
during the foam compression on the opposite side thereof 

as the flexible sheet (28).  
 
A formed laminate (20) comprising: a 
flexible sheet (28); a collapsed foam layer (30) bonded 

to the flexible sheet (28) and made from a quick 
reacting foamable liquid mixture (50) that fully expands 

in less than 25 seconds to provide a foam (51) which 
subsequently cures in less than 20 minutes at room 

temperature without any heating but which, after 
substantial completion of the expansion and before 

substantial curing has taken place, has a transitory 
state when the liquid mixture (50) is viscous and 

defines cells enclosing gas generated during the 
expansion stage of the reaction; and the flexible sheet 

(28) and the collapsed foam layer (30) having a 
contoured shape that is provided by compressing the foam 

(51) while in its transitory state and the flexible 
sheet (28) between first and second contoured mold 

surfaces (44,46) which are moved toward each other to 
collapse the foam (51) as well as provide the contoured 

shape of both the flexible sheet (28) and the collapsed 
foam layer (30). 
A formed laminate (20) as in claim 10 
wherein the flexible sheet (28) is selected from the 

group consisting of porous cloth (28a), vinyl (28b) and 
leather (28c). 
A formed laminate (20) as in claim 10 
wherein the foam (51) is selected from the group 

consisting of polyurethane foam and polyurea foam.
