<ABSTRACT>
To obviate the drawbacks both of in-tank fuel feed pumps 
associated with the fuel level indicator probe and of those 

installed along the feed line but without renouncing the 
advantages of both systems, the invention provides a fuel feed 

pump (4) of the type associated with the level probe (3), which is 
mounted elastically within a pocket (6) sealed against the tank 

interior by an elastic cowl (18).

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a level probe/fuel feed pump combination 
in particular for a motor vehicle tank. Fuel feed pumps are required to overcome the head present between 
the tank and the engine. Pumps structured to be installed along the fuel pipe are known. These pumps are tendentially costly as they have to be 
individually fitted into a specific housing and require the fuel 
pipe to be interrupted, this being a possible cause of subsequent 
leakage. To reduce costs, feed pumps integral with the fuel level indicator 
probe have been conceived in order to form a monolithic unit which 
can be quickly fixed to the tank upper wall so that the pump lies 
within the tank. However because of the particular position of the pump such units 
suffer from safety problems especially with regard to any 
explosion which could occur following the slackening (including 
accidental slackening) of electrical connections. The object of the present invention is to obviate the aforesaid 
drawbacks by providing a level probe/fuel feed pump combination  
 
which is safe against explosion as is a pump housable along the 
pipe, while at the same time being simple and economical to 
install as it forms part of a combination which also comprises the 
level probe. These objects are attained by a level probe/fuel feed pump 
combination in particular for a motor vehicle tank, in accordance 
with claims 1 and 6. In this combination the fuel feed pump is housed together with the 
level probe using the available space of the tank, and dips 
directly into the tank. The pump however remains outside said 
tank and poses no safety problems. The pump is illustrated by way of non-limiting example in the 
figures of the accompanying drawings. 
Figure 1 is a section through a first embodiment of a level 
probe/fuel feed pump combination according to the invention; Figure 2 shows an enlarged detail of the combination of Figure 1; Figure 3 is a section through a second embodiment of a level 
probe/fuel feed pump combination according to the invention; Figure 4 is a top plan view of the second embodiment of the level 
probe/fuel feed pump combination; Figure 5 is a view to an enlarged scale showing how the upper part 
of the pump of the second embodiment is fixed; Figure 6 is a view to an enlarged scale showing the gasket which 
aids the fixing of the lower part of the pump of the second 
embodiment. With reference to the aforesaid figures and in particular to 
Figures 1 and 2, the level probe/fuel feed pump combination of the  
 
invention,

<CLAIMS>
A level probe/fuel feed pump combination (1) in particular 
for a motor vehicle tank, comprising a flange (2) to be fixed to 

the outside edge of an aperture provided in the tank upper wall, 
to support on that side which is to face the tank interior a level 

probe (3), characterised in that on that side of said flange (2) 

which is to face the tank interior there is provided a pocket (6) 
inside which there is supported via an elastic element (14) the 

feed pump (4), which dips into the tank in correspondence with the 
base of said pocket (6), at said point the hydraulic seal between 

the pump (4) and pocket (6) and their mutual fixing being achieved 
by interposing between said two elements an elastic cowl (18) 

fixed at its larger-diameter edge (17) to the pocket (6) and fixed 
at its smaller-diameter edge (23) to the pump (4). 
A combination as claimed in claim 1, characterised in that 
the pocket (6) has a shape obtained by coaxially (10) joining 

together three aligned tubular elements (9-11) having diameters 
which progressively decrease towards the base (7), the diameter 

difference between the first (9) and second (10) tubular element 
determining a first projection (13) forming a support for the 

elastic element (14) supporting the pump (4), the diameter 
difference between the second (10) and third (11) tubular element 

determining a second projection (16) at which the larger-diameter 
edge of the elastic cowl (18) is fixed. 
A combination as claimed in claim 2, characterised in that 
the elastic support element (14) for the pump (4) has an "L" 

cross-section, is fixed to the pump body (4) by a hose clamp (15) 
 

and rests on the first projection (13). 
A combination as claimed in claim 2, characterised in that 
the elastic cowl (18) is of "U" cross-section and is fixed by hose 

clamps (8). 
A combination as claimed in claim 1, characterised by 
comprising a filter (21) upstream of the pump (4) and able to 

deform elastically by the effect of the variation in distance 
between the upper wall and lower wall of the tank. 
A level probe/fuel feed pump combination (1) in particular 
for a motor vehicle tank, comprising a flange (2) to be fixed to 

the outside edge of an aperture provided in the tank upper wall, 
to support on that side which is to face the tank interior a level 

probe (3), characterised in that on that side of said flange (2) 
which is to face the tank interior there is provided a pocket (6) 

inside which there is positioned the fuel feed pump (4), which is 
elastically fixed at its top by a first gasket (26) provided with 

second annular projections (29) and interposed between a 
projection (27) on the pump (4) and a second flange (24) also 

provided with annular projections (28) and fixed to the first 
flange (2), said pump (4) dipping into the tank in correspondence 

with the base of said pocket (6), at said point the hydraulic seal 
between the pump (4) and pocket (6) and their mutual fixing being 

achieved by interposing between said two elements a second elastic 
gasket (30) housed in an annular seat (31) provided on the base 

(7) of the pocket (6) and simultaneously mounted on a suction pipe 
stub (19) of the pump (4).
