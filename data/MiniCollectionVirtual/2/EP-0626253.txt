<ABSTRACT>
A machine for scraping tyres and the like comprising means of handling 
(6, 106) and actuation (4, 104) of a tyre (7) made integral with a 

frame (1) according to a horizontal axis, constituting the axis of 
rotation of tyre (7) and of a work tool (11), and a device (8) for 

lifting the tyre, one (6) of such means of handling being capable of 
being operated in rotation but fixed in translation to constitute a 

fixed zero setting for positioning vertical axis of symmetry (z-z) of 
tyre (7), work tool (11) being capable of moving in a horizontal 

direction parallel to the axis of rotation of the tyre so as to achieve 
the positioning of their vertical axis of symmetry (y-y) in 

superposition with axis of symmetry (x-x) of the said tyre in relation 
to width dimension (x) of tyre (7) and to fixed reference (6).

<DESCRIPTION>
The object of this invention is a machine for scraping tyres and the 
like with the relative positioning of the tyre and the work tool being 
capable of being controlled in relation to a fixed reference. It is known that in the technology of the so-called retreading of tyres 
- that is, the replacement of the old, worn tread with a new tread - it 
is necessary to perform a preliminary operation to smooth the surface 
of the said tyre before applying the new tread. From JP-A-58001546 
there is also known a machine in accordance with the preamble of claim 1, 
capable of performing this operation, 
commonly known as "scraping", in which provision is made for applying 
the tyre to be processed to a support consisting of two plates driven 
by mechanical arms the spacing of which corresponds to the thickness of 
the tyre being processed, according to the original geometrical 
features. Such machines are usually equipped with devices for centring the tyre 
with respect to an axis of symmetry which also represents the axis of 
symmetry of the work tool, which is fixed and represents in substance 
the reference setting for positioning the tyre. In such machines, however, it may happen that positioning of the tyre 
carcass in a central position does not prove correct because centring 
is obtained by means of pneumatic actuators the stroke of which is 
determined by the contact with the opposite faces of the tyre, which 
may not be correctly positioned, thus resulting in imperfect 
processing. There is therefore posed the technical problem of providing an 
automatic machine for scraping tyre carcasses which will make it 
possible to achieve centring of the work tool in relation to the axis  
 
of symmetry irrespective of the initial setting of the tyre in the work 
zone and in relation to the machine's own absolute, fixed and 
predetermined reference. Such results are obtained with the present invention, which provides a 
machine for scraping tyres and the like comprising means for handling 
and actuating of a tyre, which are integral with a frame according to a 
horizontal axis constituting the axis of rotation of the tyre and of a 
work tool, one of such means of 
handling may be driven in rotation but is fixed in translation to 
constitute a fixed zero reference for positioning the vertical axis of 
symmetry (z-z) of the tyre, while the other one of such means of 
handling is idle in rotation but capable of translation according to 
the horizontal axis of rotation of the tyre in order to bring about 
clamping

<CLAIMS>
A machine for scraping tyres and the like, comprising 
means for handling (6, 106) and actuation (4, 104) of a tyre (7) made integral 

with a frame (1) according to a horizontal axis constituting the axis of rotation of 
tyre (7) and a work tool (11 ), one (6) of such 

means of handling being capable of being operated in rotation but fixed in 
translation to constitute a fixed zero reference for positioning the vertical axis of 

symmetry (z-z) of tyre (7), the other one (106) of such means of handling being 
idle in rotation but capable of translating according to the horizontal axis of
