<DESCRIPTION>
This invention concerns heterocyclic derivatives which are 
useful in inhibiting squalene synthase, processes for their preparation 
and pharmaceutical compositions containing them. The present invention 
is also concerned with methods of using such heterocyclic derivatives in 
diseases and medical conditions where inhibition of squalene synthase is 
desirable, for example in treating diseases or medical conditions such as 
hypercholesterolemia and atherosclerosis. Several different classes of compounds have been reported to 
possess the capability of being able to lover cholesterol levels in blood 
plasma. For example agents which inhibit the enzyme HMG CoA reductase, 
which is essential for the production of cholesterol, have been reported 
to reduce levels of serum cholesterol. Illustrative of this class of 
compounds is the HMGCoA reductase inhibitor known as lovastatin which is 
disclosed in US Patent No 4,231,938. Other agents which are reported to 
lover serum cholesterol include those which act by complexing with bile 
acids in the intestinal system and which are hence termed "bile acid 
sequestrants". It is believed that many of such agents act by 
sequestering bile acids within the intestinal tract. This results in a 
lowering of the levels of bile acid circulating in the enteroheptatic 
system and promoting replacement of bile acids by synthesis in the liver 
from cholesterol, which results in an upregulation of the heptatic LDL 
receptor and thus in a lowering of circulating blood cholesterol levels. Squalene synthase is a microsomal enzyme which catalyses the 
first committed step of cholesterol biosynthesis. Two molecules of 
farnesyl pyrophosphate (FPP) are condensed in the presence of the reduced 
form of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) to form 
squalene. The inhibition of this committed step to cholesterol should 
leave unhindered biosynthetic pathways to ubiquinone, dolichol and 
isopentenyl t-RNA. Elevated cholesterol levels are known to be one of 
the main risk factors for ischaemic cardiovacsular disease. Thus, an 
agent which inhibits squalene synthase should be useful in treating  
 
diseases and medical conditions in which a reduction in the levels of 
cholesterol is desirable, for example hypercholesterolemia and 
atherosclerosis. Thus far, the design of squalene synthase inhibitors has 
concentrated on the preparation of analogues of the substrate farnesyl 
pyrophosphate (FPP), and hence on compounds which contain phosphorus 
groups . For example, the
