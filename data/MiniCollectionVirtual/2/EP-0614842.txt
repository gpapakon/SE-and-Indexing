<ABSTRACT>
The reel serves for wires or cords made of metal, plastic or the like and especially for welding wires. It consists of one-piece segments 1 which each form a U-shaped supporting bow which extends inwards in radial planes and has a transverse web 3 and legs 4 and the free leg ends of which have extensions 2 which extend in the circumferential direction and which, placed against one another, form two parallel wire rings and each have, for bringing the segments 1 together, a depression 5 at the transitional end to the associated U-leg 4. The radial legs 4 extend approximately as far as the reel-hub diameter 6 and there are bent round inwards or outwards in the direction of the extensions 2 and guided back radially, the outside 8 of the bend 9 giving the reel-hub diameter 6, whilst the transverse webs 3 form the reel-winding diameter 7.

A reel for wire or cable of metal, plastics material or the 
like, in particular for welding wire, comprising one-piece 

segments (1) each forming a U-shaped wire piece which extends 

inwards in radial planes and has parallel limbs (4) connected by 
a transverse bar (3), the free ends of which limbs (4) have 

extensions (2) running in the peripheral direction, which 
extensions (2) form two parallel wire rings when placed together, 

and are in each case secured to the following segment (1) for the 
purpose of joining the segments (1) together, characterized in 

that the radial limbs (4) run approximately up to the diameter 
(6) of the hub of the reel, and are there bent inwards or 

outwards in the direction of the extensions (2) and guided back 
radially in the form of short projections (12), the outside (8) 

of the curve (9) forming the diameter (6) of the hub of the reel, 
whilst the diameter (7) of winding on the reel is formed by the 

transverse bars (3) located on the end of the projections (12) 
between the limbs (4). 
A reel according to Claim 1, characterized in that the limbs 
of the short projections (12, 12', 12'', 12''') encompass an angle 

of approximately 90° to approximately -15° to the long limbs (4). 
A reel according to Claims 1 and 2, characterized in that, 
for joining the segments (1) together, the extensions (2) have 

at the end of the transition into the associated limb (4) of the 
U a depression (5) at which the ends of the extensions (2) of the 

following segment (1) are secured. 
A reel according to Claims 1 and 2, characterized in that 
the ends (10) of the extensions (2) are bent off radially 

inwards, in that they run parallel to the limbs (4) of the 
following segment in each case, and in that these ends (10) are 

connected securely to these limbs (4), for example by welded  
 

points (11). 
A reel according to Claims 1 to 4, characterized in that the 
extensions (2', 2'') extend in opposite directions.
