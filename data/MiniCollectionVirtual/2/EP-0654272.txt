<ABSTRACT>
An alimentary canal cell activator containing an epithelial cell growth factor and a lactoferrin, a hydrolyzate thereof or a 
mixture of them. The activator is effective in preventing or treating damages to an alimentary canal and improving the alimentary 

canal function of the aged and newborn, thus being useful as a medicine or an additive for various foods.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a digestive tract cell
activating agent. More particularly, the present invention relates
to a digestive tract cell activating agent which contains an
epidermal growth factor, lactoferrins and/or a hydrolysate of
lactoferrin, and is useful widely in the medical treatment area
including prevention and therapy of digestive tract diseases,
promotion of digestive tract functions and activation thereof.Epidermal growth factor (hereinafter sometimes referred to
as "EGF") is a peptide having a molecular weight of about 6,000,
has proliferation-stimulating functions for a wide variety of
mammalian cells, and is contained in body fluid of all mammals.
Since EGF is contained in breastmilk in a relatively high
concentration, general attention is attracted by the relationship
between EGF and growth and development of a newborn (neonate in the
case of an animal), and among others, the effect of EGF on the
development of digestive tract of neonatal rat and mouse has been
studied. For example, it has been clarified that feeding a neonatal
rat with an artificial milk added with EGF accelerate synthesis of
DNA in the small intestine [C.L. Berseth: American Journal of
Physiology, Vol. 253, p. G662, 1987], and that it increases the wet
weight of stomach [J. Falconer: Biology of the Neonate, Vol. 52, p.
347, 1987, and E.V. O'Loughlin, et al;American Journal of
Physiology, Vol. 249, p. G674, 1985]. It has also been demonstrated
that administration of EGF to a neonatal rat accelerates
development of functions of the small intestine and mucosa thereof
[C. Malo, et al: Gastroenterology, Vol. 83, p. 23, 1982, and Y.
Oka, et al: Endocrinology, Vol. 112, p. 940, 1983]. There are known some cases of application of EGF for therapy
of digestive tract diseases in accordance with the findings as
described above. A recent case is reported where administration of
EGF to an eight-month old infant suffering from necrotic
inflammation of small intestine (necrotising enteritis) led to
recovery of fatal damages to the digestive tract [P.E. Sullivan, et
al: Lancet, Vol. 338, p. 53, 1991], demonstrating clinical
effectiveness of EGF.The effect and the action mechanism of EGF on cultured cells
have widely been studied to date since discovery of EGF in 1962.
Regarding digestive tract cells, it has now been clarified that DNA
synthesis in intestine epithelial cells is accelerated by EGF, and
this action is caused via an EGF receptor present in the cytoplasmic
membrane [M.E. Forgue-Lafitte, et al: FEBS Letter, Vol.
