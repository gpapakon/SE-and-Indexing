amide-alkali metal salt in an aromatic hydrocarbon to 
give a thiazole-N-alkyl-acid amidated product, and 

hydrolyzing the resulting compound in the presence of an 
aromatic hydrocarbon.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a thiazole derivative 
and a process for preparing the derivative. Various processes have been heretofore reported for 
preparing 2-isopropyl-4-chloromethylthiazole represented by 
the formula 
   For example, Japanese Unexamined Publications Nos. 
151183/1977 and 103168/1981 disclose the preparation of 2-isopropyl-4-chloromethylthiazole 
by reacting 
isobutyrothioamide with 1,3-dichloroacetone in ethanol. 
Agricultural and Biological Chemistry, vol. 36, No.13, pp. 
2287 (1972) discloses the preparation of 2-isopropyl-4-chloromethylthiazole 
by reacting isobutyrothioamide with 
1,3-dichloroacetone in benzene. However, these processes 
produce the objective 2-isopropyl-4-chloromethylthiazole 
merely in a low yield and with a low purity. Further the 
former process provides the objective compound in the form 
of a salt of hydrochloric acid, and thus essentially 
involves use of hydrogen chloride gas. On the other hand, 
the latter process employs sodium hydroxide to isolate the 
objective compound, inevitably resulting in the  
 
decomposition of the objective compound due to the sodium 
hydroxide used and thus in a pronounced decrease of yield 
and purity. In short, known processes for the preparation of 
2-isopropyl-4-chloromethylthiazole are not commercially 
beneficial. Thus, it is the object of the present invention to 
provide a thiazole derivative which can be suitably used as 
information display materials, antiglare materials, and 
intermediates for the preparation of medicaments, 
agricultural chemicals and the like, and to provide a 
commercially beneficial process for preparing said thiazole 
derivative. This object has been achieved by a thiazole derivative 
represented by the formula (1) 
wherein R² is an alkyl group having 1 to 4 carbon atoms and 
by a process for preparing the derivative as shown below. It is common practice to react a monoalkyl amine with 
2-isopropyl-4-chloromethylthiazole for the substitution of 
N-alkylamino group for the chloro group of the thiazole. 
This method requires a monoalkyl amine in large excess and 
produces a tertiary amine and quaternary ammonium salt, 
which reduce the yield of the objective product and decrease 
the purity thereof due to their presence as contaminants. 
Consequently, the method can never be commercially 
advantageous.
 
 
However, the thiazole derivative of the formula (1) in 
accordance with the invention can be prepared by reacting 2-isopropyl-4-chloromethylthiazole 
represented by the formula 
(2)
