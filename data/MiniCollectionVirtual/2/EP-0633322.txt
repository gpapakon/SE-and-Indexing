<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a process for making steel having a low phosphorus content from pig iron, scrap and additions in a converter, in which the pig iron has oxygen injected (blown) thereinto via a lance, and flush gas (stirring gas) via the bottom. In so doing, prior to end of blow, at a particular CO content, the temperature of the steel is measured and is compared with the target temperature, the amount of oxygen yet to be injected being determined as a function of the temperature difference. If overblowing should be necessary, coolant is added.

<CLAIMS>
Method of making steel with a low phosphorus content
from pig iron, scrap iron and additives (lime) in a

converter, whereby oxygen is blown through a lance and a
scavenging gas through the bottom into the pig iron and

the decarbonisation of the melt is detected by measuring
the CO-content of the fumes, characterised by the

following steps:

a) shortly before the end of blowing, at a predefinable
carbon loss value or absolute value of the CO-content in

the fumes, the temperature of the steel is measured,
b) this actual temperature is compared with the target
temperature of the steel,
c) depending on the difference between the actual and
target temperatures, a quantity of oxygen still to be

blown is determined with which the FeO-content in the
slag correlating with the phosphorus or carbon content at

the end of melting can be set to more than 10%, so that
when a temperature difference is detected:


which is sufficient to achieve both the target
temperature and the target FeO-content, a corresponding

quantity of oxygen is blown,
which would require no quantity of oxygen sufficient to
reach the FeO-content, the melt is deliberately overblown

thermally and the increase in the temperature of the
steel occurring as a result is offset by introducing

coolants,
d) at the end of blowing, without further sampling or
temperature measurement, the steel is run off directly

from the converter.
Method according to claim 1, characterised in that
the carbon loss is set to a value dC/dt of 600 to 300

kg/min.
Method according to claim 1, characterised in that
the absolute value of the carbon content present in the

fumes is between 7 to 1%, preferably 3.5 to 2.5%.
Method according to claim 1, characterised in that
essentially ore, sinter, slag, scrap iron and/or lime are

introduced as coolants.
Method according to claim 4, characterised in that
when the oxygen-bearing coolants ore, sinter and possibly

slag are introduced, the quantity of oxygen introduced by
them is subtracted from the quantity of oxygen blown.
Method according to claim 5, characterised in that
the quantity of oxygen is selected according to the

target content of phosphorus or carbon of the higher FeO-content
correlating with these.
Method according to one of the preceding claims,
characterised in that with a quantity of oxygen

sufficient to reach the target phosphorus or carbon
content, but with which the target temperature cannot be

attained, a heating means is added to the melt.
Method according to claim 7, characterised in that
essentially fossil fuels, FeSi or aluminium are used as

heating means.
