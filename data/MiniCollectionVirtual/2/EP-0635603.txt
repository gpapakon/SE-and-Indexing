<ABSTRACT>
An arrangement for filling the sleeper interspaces between successive sleepers (8) of a track skeleton and between the sleepers and a continuous concrete slab (TRG) deposited on a formation in the case of ballastless track construction, comprises a track-bound concrete pump (14) at the rear end of the arrangement in the working direction thereof, a concrete finisher (4) for filling concrete into the sleeper interspaces at the front end of the arrangement and a pumping line (16) between concrete pump and concrete finisher, which is supported on track-bound line carriers (18) and the length of which is adapted to the working speed of the concrete finisher in such a way that the concrete pump (14), moving forwards essentially in the same manner as the concrete finisher (4), always travels on sufficiently set filling concrete.
