<ABSTRACT>
The present invention is directed to polyurethane moldings 
produced via the RIM process. These polyurethane moldings have 

excellent reactivity, demold properties (at a 30s demold), and good 
elongation and tear strength, and comprise the reaction product of an 

aliphatic polyisocyanate having a viscosity of less than about 20,000 
mPa·s at 25°C and a NCO functionality of 2.3 to 4.0 with an isocyanate-reactive 

component comprising b1) a relatively high molecular weight 
organic compound containing at least one of the groups selected from 

the group consisting of hydroxy groups and amine groups; and b2) a low 
molecular weight c
hain extender selected from the group consisting of 
diols, triols, primary amines, secondary amines, aminoalcohols, and 

mixtures thereof; in the presence of a catalyst. The OH:NH ratio of the 
chain extender is from 1:1 to 25:1.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a process for the production of
polyurethane moldings from a reaction mixture via the RIM process.The production of polyurethane moldings via the reaction injection
molding (i.e. RIM) technique is well known and described in, for example,
U.S. Patent 4,218,543. The RIM process involves a technique of filling
the mold by which highly reactive, liquid starting components are injected
into the mold within a very short time by means of a high output, high
pressure dosing apparatus after they have been mixed in so-called
"positively controlled mixing heads".In the production of polyurethane moldings via the RIM process,
the reaction mixture generally comprises an A-side based on
polyisocyanates and a B-side based on organic compounds containing
isocyanate-reactive hydrogen atoms, in addition to suitable chain
extenders, catalysts, blowing agents, and other additives. The
polyisocyanates which are suitable for a commercial RIM process are the
aromatic isocyanates, such as, for example, diphenyl methane-4,4'-diisocyanate
(i.e. MDI) and toluene diisocyanate (i.e. TDI).Aliphatic isocyanates are broadly disclosed in the long list of
suitable isocyanates for use in a RIM process in various patents,
including, for example, U.S. Patent 4,937,366. High productivity
commercial RIM processes require a 30s demold time, and prefer mold
temperatures less than 80°C for worker safety and energy efficiency.U.S. Patent 4,772,639 corresponding to EP-A-0 275 010
describes a process for the production of
polyurethane moldings reacting organic polyisocyanates with organic 
compounds containing isocyanate-reactive hydrogen atoms in the
presence of catalysts and auxiliary agents inside a closed mold. The
isocyanate component is based on (a1) mixtures of (i) 1-isocyanate-3,3,5-trimethyl-5-isocyanatomethylcyclohexane
(i.e. IPDI), and (ii)
polyisocyanates containing isocyanurate groups prepared by the
trimerization of a portion of the isocyanate groups of 1,6-diisocyanatohexane,
or (a2) (i) IPDI and (iii) polyisocyanates containing isocyanurate
groups prepared by the trimerization of a portion of the isocyanate
groups of a mixture of 1,6-diisocyanatohexane and IPDI. These reaction
mixtures are broadly disclosed as being suitable for RIM processing.
However, the reference requires unusually long demold times, i.e. from
3-10 minutes. These demold times are not commercially acceptable.IPDI (i.e., 1-isocyanate-3,3,5-trimethyl-5-isocyanatomethylcyclohexane)
is a sterically hindered tertiary cycloaliphatic
