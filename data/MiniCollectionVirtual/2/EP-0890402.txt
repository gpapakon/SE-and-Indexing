<ABSTRACT>
On the accommodation area is at least one clamping area formed by an elastically outwardly bendable wall part running in the peripheral direction of the accommodation area. The wall part limits a hollow space (25-29), which is connected with at least one hydraulic pressure source (33). The accommodation area has at least three clamping areas, which are arranged at an axial distance from one another. The number of clamping areas of the accommodation area and the spaces between them is determined corresponding to the width of the ribs required for the axial lateral fixture of the wall parts. The wall parts limiting a hollow space are part of a casing-shaped clamping body (3) extending through the accommodation area, which has circulating ribs or a screw line-shaped circulating rib, forming the limitation between the hollow spaces (25-29) and firmly connected with the device housing (2) or a support pin.
