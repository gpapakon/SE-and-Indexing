<ABSTRACT>
A prosthetic device to occlude an opening present in a 
defective interatrial septum, the device having at least two clips 

(1) for firmly gripping peripheral portions around the opening. The 
material further has a flat occluder (5) to close the opening, and at 

least two fastening means (2) for securing the clips to the flat 
occluder. The prosthetic device can be applied to the defective 

interatrial septum permanently and easily in an endermic-transvascular 
manner.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a prosthetic device to occlude an
opening present in a defective interatrial septum, the device
comprising a flat occluder to close the opening present in the
septum.More generally, the invention relates to a prosthetic device
used in the repair of interatrial septal defects. More
particularly, it relates to a prosthetic device which will be
brought in an endermical and transvascular manner through a catheter
and up to a defective opening of a septum present between
the right and left atria.In 1976, King and Mills reported their treatment of an
interatrial septal defect [JAMA, 235, 2506 (1976)]. In this first
successful case wherein a prosthetic device was brought through a
catheter up to the septum in an endermic-transvascular manner, they
used a pair of umbrella-shaped disk members which were disposed in
the right atrium and left atrium, respectively. A tool employed in
their operation was an assembly of a central wire and two catheters
coaxially combined with one another. The disk members sandwiching
the septum were fixed one to the other to close the defective
opening thereof. It is noted, however, that their device was so
large in diameter and the disk members were so stiff that this
operation could not be performed on young children, particularly
not preschool children. Rashkind, who had tried to provide a 
smaller-sized device, reported in 1977 his successful clinical
procedure performed on a young child patient [Circulation, 67, 711
(1983)]. He used a clogging material of the single-umbrella type
having hooks. The hooks, however, were highly likely to cause a
jamming of the umbrella-like material, wherein the clogging
material once opened within a heart could never be displaced
therein or removed therefrom. In such an event, doctors would have
to perform open heart surgery. He then proposed an improved device
comprising two umbrella-shaped members united integrally with each
other, and this device has been widely used in the clinical
treatment of the unclosed ductus arteriosus.On the other hand, Lock, who had improved Rashkind's device of
the double and integral disk type, added a coiled spring to an
intermediate portion of each of eight stainless steel ribs. The
two disks capable of tightly overlapping one another can now firmly
grip a thin septum present between the atria. Hhas filed a patent
application for his improved system (see EP 0 541 063 A2). Lock's
device having the umbrella-like disks resembling as a whole a clam,
viz. one species of Bivalvia, is called a
