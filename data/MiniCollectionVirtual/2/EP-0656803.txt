 MICROPOROUS FILTRATION FUNNEL ASSEMBLYField of the Invention This invention relates to an in-line filter assembly of a type having a housing divided into inlet and outlet chambers by a filter membrane having its periphery fluid-flow-sealed within the housing, the assembly being readily disassemblable so that the filter membrane can be removed for identification or analysis of the material filtered from the fluid during use of the filter.Background Art Disposable in-line filters are conventionally made of two molded polymeric plastic housing components with peripheral flanges which are permanently sealingly bonded together with the periphery of the filter membrane therebetween. Such in-line filters can be made at relatively low cost. However, after use the filter membrane cannot be removed intact for identification and analysis of materials on the membrane resulting from the filtration. Disassemblable in-line filters enabling filter membrane removal after filtration are known; however, they have been of costly construction rendering it uneconomical to dispose of them after just one use. On the other hand, reuse of such filters is likewise uneconomical because of the cleaning operations required between uses.The filter device of the present invention is readily disassemblable for filter membrane removal after 

use yet is of relatively low cost construction so that it can be disposed of after a single use.Brief Description of the Invention According to a preferred embodiment of the invention, the filtration funnel assembly comprises an open-ended upper body or reservoir for receiving liquid to be filtered and a lower body or filter base adapted to telescopically engage with and disengage from the upper body. Preferably, these bodies are generally cylindrical in shape. The upper body has a first rim portion defining an internal shoulder and a second rim portion defining an external shoulder having an inner wall surface. The lower body which serves as a conduit for leak-proof axial flow of filtered liquid therethrough comprises 1) an outer wall or shell having an upper rim portion that is telescopically engageable between the internal and external shoulders of the upper body, 2) a transverse filter support, 3) an annular gasket, 4) a filter pad, and 5) a filter membrane. The annular gasket and the filter pad are preferably formed together as an integral unit. The rim portion of the external shoulder has locking open slot means, and the outer wall has tab means with radially outward projection means such as

Claims
1. A filtration funnel assembly comprising an open-ended upper body or reservoir for receiving liquid to be filtered and a lower body or base adapted to telescopically engage with and disengage from said upper body; said upper body having a first rim portion defining an internal shoulder and a second rim portion defining an external shoulder having an inner wall surface; said lower body serving as a conduit for leak- proof axial flow of filtered liquid therethrough comprising 1) an outer wall or shell having an upper rim portion that is telescopically engageable between the internal and external shoulders of said upper body, 2) a transverse filter support, 3) an annular gasket, 4) a filter pad, and 5) a filter membrane; and the rim portion of said external shoulder having locking slot means and said outer wall having tab means with radially outward projection means that forms a lock fit with the locking slot means when the upper and lower bodies are aligned in telescopic engagement.
2. The assembly of claim 1, wherein the upper rim portion of said outer wall comprises access slot means allowing access therethrough for grasping the edge of the filter membrane for removal of the membrane from the lower body when it is disengaged from the upper body. 


 3. The assembly of claim 2, wherein the inner wall surface comprises guide rib means located in circumferential registry with said access slot means when the upper and lower bodies are in telescopic engagement.
4. The assembly of claim 3 wherein the guide rib means is circumferentially spaced from the locking slot means so as to guidably assist the upper and lower bodies to be correctly placed for joining in interlocking telescopic engagement.
5. The assembly of claim 1 comprising a diametrically opposed pair of slot means and a matching pair of tab means.
6. The assembly of claim 1, wherein the upper body and the lower body are generally cylindrical.
7. The assembly of claim 1 having port means comprising a central opening in the filter support.
8. The assembly of claim 7 comprising closure means for the port means.
9. The assembly of claim 7, wherein the port means is formed as a drain spout.
10. The assembly of claim 5 wherein, for 


locking, the tab means comprises a pair of diametrically opposed inwardly flexible tabs each formed with a projection shaped at its outer surface for locking registry with its respective slot means such that the upper and lower bodies are axially interlocked together.
11. The assembly of claim 10, wherein the tab means are adapted to be releasable from the interlock by manually squeezing the tabs together.
12. The assembly of claim 1, wherein the periphery of the filter membrane is in direct sealing contact with and is superposed upon the annular gasket.
13. The assembly of claim 1, wherein the upper body and the lower body are each formed with an opening that one at a time may be closed by a common interchangeable closure.
14. The assembly of claim 1, wherein the filter membrane lies flat upon the filter pad.
15. The assembly of claim 12, wherein the upper and lower bodies are in telescopic engagement for air and fluid tight filtration under vacuum, said opening of the upper body is sealed by a closure and the lower rim of the internal shoulder is held under axial compression by contact with the periphery of the filter membrane which 


periphery is in direct compressive contact with the annular gasket.
