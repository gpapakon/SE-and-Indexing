<ABSTRACT>
A suspension system for the steering and driving wheel in a vehicle, wherein a hydraulic cylinder (2) is used as suspension and wherein the same cylinder functions in form of a fulcrum pin as the bearing of the steering and driving wheel (3) turning motion and wherein the power transmission to the wheel is effected with a hydraulic system by means of a hub motor (4) connected with the same. The cylinder body (2) of the hydraulic cylinder and the dead body of the hub motor (4) are joined together forming a rigid unit.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a system according to patent claim 1 
by means of which the turning and driving wheel of a vehicle is 
suspended to the vehicle body. Previously known is the utilization of hydraulic cylinders as 
a vehicle spring and attenuator when the cylinder fluid is connected 
by delivery tubes to a hydraulic accumulator, whereto 
the fluid flows or from where it flows back. Baffling is 
produced for instance by choking the delivery tubes. A cylinder 
is used to suspend the turning wheels also as a s.c. king bolt 
while letting the piston revolve in the cylinder in the turning 
motion direction. The rigidity of the spring suspension has 
been adjusted with the cylinder pressure or degree of attenuation 
and the ground clearance is, as is well known, adjusted by 
a cylinder with spring function. As example the German publication 
1 120 290 is mentioned. In the first place, the known solutions have been applied to 
private cars with advanced suspension automation. As to their 
construction and properties, they do not fit to low-speed 
vehicles or working machines. In working machines, such as 
excavators and loaders, there is no reason use the suspension 
at all while working. To prevent swaying during transportation 
of loads with working machines, the suspension may be kept in 
function only either in the front or rear wheels. In many cases all the working machine wheels are wanted to be 
driving, whereat power transmission must also be arranged for 
the driving wheels and often also spring suspension. As it is 
known, the power transmission is effected over the cardan shaft 
and by means of hub motors. For example, in publication DE-1 120 290 the cylinder portion 
of the hydraulic cylinder is connected to a body, on which the 
wheel is fastened with bearings, and which is the hub part of  
 
the wheel. The fluid motor is an independent detachable device 
that transmits the rotation motion over the hub centre to the 
brake drum illustrated in the figure. In this construction the 
hydraulic motor is not, as is not any part of it, a supporting 
structure, neither does any device, related to wheel suspension, 
be in contact with it. The construction becomes quite 
complicated when the hydraulic driving motor is made easily 
detachable and the hydraulic motor bearing is not utilized as 
bearing for the wheel. By means of the system according to the invention a decisive 
improvement of the suspension of a steering and driving wheel 
is achieved and the invention is characterized in what is
