<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a shear-stable viscosity improver for
lubricating oils, especially for mineral oils of paraffinic type.It is also aimed at the compositions based on this improver as well as
at lubricating oils comprising an effective proportion of the said improver,
optionally introduced by means of the said compositions.Viscosity improvers are usually macromolecular compounds.FR-A-1 390 228 discloses copolymers with improved relationship between viscosity and temperature.The objective of the invention is, above all, to provide a new viscosity
improver for lubricating oils, which, besides the characteristics which are
conventionally sought after, namely improving the viscosity index of the said
oils, exhibits a markedly improved shear strength when compared with
improvers that are already known.It is known that when lubricating oils are placed under extreme use
conditions such as are encountered, for example, in gearboxes, differentials
and gears of all kinds, especially in motor vehicles, the viscosity improvers
incorporated in these oils are subjected to high shear stresses which cause
them to lose their properties at least partially and which consequently lead to
losses in viscosity in the lubricating oils.These losses in viscosity are of two types: they are, on the one hand,
temporary losses in viscosity and, on the other hand, irreversible losses in
viscosity.Temporary losses in viscosity are observed during operation; they arise
from the aligning of the macromolecular chains which takes place in the shear
field, and are reversible.Irreversible losses in viscosity are due to scissions of the
macromolecular chains (D.E. Hillman, P.R. Marris, J.I. Paul and D. Pickles
- Institute of Petroleum, vol. 008, 1977).Users of the oils of the kind in question are increasingly demanding
and want the irreversible losses in viscosity, in other words the number of
scissions of the macromolecular chains, to be as small as possible. To characterize the shear strength of a viscosity improver, a strength
which is proportionately greater the lower the irreversible losses in viscosity
of a lubricating oil treated with this additive, use is made of the following
tests, according to which the said additive, which is predissolved in a
formulating oil, is subjected to high shear stresses with the aid of a shearing
tool.In general, use is made of two types of tools, the use of which then
characterizes the test.In the first case this is a system of toothed wheels contained by a
"FZG" machine and, in the other case,
