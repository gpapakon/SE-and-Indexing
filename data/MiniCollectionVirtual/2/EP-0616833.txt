<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a soot filter for diesel engines having a plurality of tubular filter candles (8) arranged in parallel to each other in a filter space, through the wall of which filter candles passes the exhaust gas from the outside to the inside and the soot deposits on the tubular outer wall in order, after forming a layer, to be burnt off there by a burner (19), the exhaust gases from the combustion chamber passing into the filter space through an, in particular, grating-type partition (15), an open space (14), free from filter candles and hollow profiles, being in an, in particular, central area of the filter space parallel to the filter candles, which open space, as a longitudinal duct, has a cross-section whose smallest diameter is larger than the external diameter of a filter candle and the exhaust gas intake orifice to the open space having a larger cross-section than the cross-sections of the remaining intake orifices (13).

A soot filter for diesel engines, having a number of tubular 
filter cartridges (8) which are disposed parallel one beside the 

other in a filter space and through whose wall the exhaust gas 
passes inwardly, the soot being deposited on the tube outside 

wall where, after the formation of a layer, it is burnt off by a 
burner (19), the exhaust gases passing from the combustion 

chamber into the filter space via a more particularly grid-shaped 
partition (16), characterized in that 


there is provided in a more particularly central zone of the 
filter space a free space (14), free from filter cartridges and 

hollow sections and parallel with the filter cartridges, which is 
a longitudinal channel having a cross-section whose smallest 

diameter is larger than the external diameter of a filter 
cartridge (8), and 
the exhaust gas inlet opening (15) in the partition (16) to the 
free space (14) has a larger cross-section than the cross-sections 

of the other inlet openings (13) of the partition 
situated between the filter cartridges. 
A soot filter according to claim 1, characterized in that the 
free space (14) is bounded laterally by filter cartridges (8) and 

at both end faces by the end walls of the filter space.
  
 

channel) 14 which extends as far as the rear end of the filter 
space and whose smallest diameter is larger than the external 

diameter of a filter cartridge. The free space 14 can be formed 
by the omission of a central filter cartridge at that place.
 
In the zone of the free space 14 the partition 16 has a gas 

passage opening 15 whose cross-section and diameter are larger 
than in the case of the other opening 13 with which the partition 

16 is formed between the filter cartridges. Through the opening 
15 and the free space 14 the flame gases of the burner extend far 

into the filter space 7.
