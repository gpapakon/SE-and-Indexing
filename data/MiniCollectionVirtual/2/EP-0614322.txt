<ABSTRACT>
A mobile telecommunications system for a large area 
telecommunications system, including a plurality of different networks, has a 

directory/network structure (FIG. 1) for minimizing data storage and transmission 
and switching capacity requirements for locating roaming mobile terminals. A 

directory/network structure is provided with a plurality of directory/switching nodes 
(101,111,112,121-124,131-138) arranged such that only one logical information and 

transmission path exists between any two nodes.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to network structures for, and methods of, call 
routing and storing data pertaining to mobile radiotelephone subscribers, and finds 
application in the provision of public telecommunications services within a large 
geographical service area (i.e. international). It is anticipated that 50% of the speech services provided by public 
telecommunications networks by the year 2000 will involve mobile subscriber 
terminals. To provide service to these mobile subscribers, it will be necessary to locate 
significant numbers of roaming subscriber terminals. Serving the roaming subscribers 
over a plurality of different networks within large geographical areas will under current 
subscriber directory schemes require huge data bases and transmission/switching 
capacity. Existing public land mobile networks use a centralized home location 
register to store subscriber information. This register is interrogated to retrieve location 
information. It requires a large transmission and switching capacity and requires 
considerable time to locate information. Directory systems with a hierarchal tree structure for application to large 
scale telecommunications networks have been proposed [RACE project 1043 (mobile)]. 
This directory arrangement guides a cell from a home node to a visited node. However, 
it requires that location information be stored in all the nodes in each level of the tree 
including the visited and home nodes. IEEE NETWORK; THE MAGAZINE OF COMPUTER 
COMMUNICATIONS, vol.4, no. 6, November 1990, NEW YORK US, pages 50-60, 
FUJIOKA 'Hierarchical and Distributed Information Handling for UPT' discusses 
various types of personal telecommunication services, including hierarchical 
information handling and information localization schemes and their applicability to 
personal telecommunication services. This is realized by interconnecting multiple local 
networks via a transmit network, and multiple transit networks via a global network. 
The database in each local network keeps the detailed location information for 
subscribers located in it. The central database in each transit network keeps the  
 
information of where local network subscribers not in their home network but in the one 
of the local networks in the transit network are currently located. The global database 
keeps the information of the transit network in which subscribers outside their home 
transit network are currently located. If the called person is located inside his/her home 
network, no location information is

A network structure for call routing and storing data pertaining to mobile 
radiotelephone subscribers,
 
including; 


a plurality of data handling nodes connected in a bifurcation tree 
type geometric configuration, including a root node (101), a plurality of service nodes 

(131, 132, 133, 134, 135, 136, 137, 138) including a home node and a plurality of 
visited nodes and a plurality of levels of intermediary nodes (111, 112, 121, 122, 123, 

124) between the root node and the service nodes; 
each of the root, service and intermediary nodes including data 
storage (302) and processing circuitry (303) for handling subscriber information 

inquiries and subscriber inquiry call routing;
 
CHARACTERIZED BY 
the subscriber information being only stored at each of the nodes in a shortest 
path between a visited node and the home node; 
means for addressing subscriber information requests to a node in the tree 
common to subscribers home node and a visited node location if subscriber is roaming; 
each node including processing means (303) for direction 
information requests in a search pattern allowing a node at a minimum level of the tree 

height above a level of the service nodes with the desired information to process the 
request; and 
each node further including switching routing means (306) for 
routing call requests through a node at a minimum level of the tree height above a level 

of the service nodes at which the call request is entered. 
A network structure as claimed in claim 1, including: 

means included in a request receiving node for responding to 
requests for updating subscriber information, including 
means (303) for classifying the request receiving node 
identifiable as either a home node, a visited node or an intermediary node serving as a 

root to a subtree of the network structure to the subscriber; and  
 
means (303) for responding to the means for classifying by 
answering the request if a home node and directing the inquiry along branches of the 

tree likely to include a visited node including subscriber information. 
A network structure as claimed in claim 1, wherein each node 
includes means for processing location update request messages for enabling processes 

that identify a subscriber and the related visited and home node. 
A network structure as claimed in claim 1, wherein each node 
includes means for processing Obsolete Location indication messages that denote a 

subscriber and an old visited node. 
A network structure as claimed in claim 1, wherein each node 
includes means for processing Obsolete Location Res
ponse messages that denote a 
subscriber and an old visited node. 
A network structure as claimed in claim 1, wherein each node 
includes means for processing information requests in response to requests for call 

routing that follow a transmission path from an originating node to a home node or 
visited node via the shortest path through a common root node. 
A method of call routing and storing data pertaining to mobile 
radiotelephone subscribers on a communication system including a plurality of data 

handling nodes each including data storage and data processing circuitry, the nodes 
being connected in a bifurcation tree structure geometric configuration, including a root 

node (101), a plurality of service nodes (131, 132, 133, 134, 135, 136, 137, 138) and a

node for controlling processing of the request.
