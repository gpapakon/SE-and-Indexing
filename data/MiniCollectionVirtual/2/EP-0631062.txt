<ABSTRACT>
The invention describes a clamping connection between a sleeve (2) and a shaft (12), the sleeve being designed as a clamping sleeve and clamping the shaft at the circumference in the exposed receiving region, the sleeve, which is guided onto the shaft, being designed so as to be at least partially radially deformable, a clamping ring (4) rotatable in the circumferential direction, which, with its opening, surrounds the outer circumference of the sleeve (2), resting on the outer circumference of the sleeve, one or more radially outward-pointing cams (17) being formed integrally around the circumference of the sleeve (2), these cams being assigned wedge cams which are arranged on the inner circumference of the clamping ring and narrow in a radially inwards direction.

<CLAIMS>
Clamping connection between a sleeve and a shaft, in 
which the sleeve is constructed as a clamping sleeve which 

clamps the shaft on the circumference and the sleeve (2), 
guided onto the shaft (12) is constructed so as to be at 

least partially radially deformable, in which a 
circumferentially rotatable clamping ring (4) lies against 

the outer circumference of the sleeve (2) and grasps around 
the outer circumference of the sleeve (2) with its opening, 

and the opening of the clamping ring (4) has on its inner 
circumference control surfaces running in a wedge shape in 

radial direction, which lie against the outer circumference 
of the sleeve,
 
characterised in that
 
one or more cams (17) are formed, directed radially 

outwards, distributed on the circumference of the sleeve 
(2), which cams (17) cooperate with the control surfaces of 

the clamping ring (4) which narrow in a wedge shape, and 
that the shaft (12) is provided in the clamping region with 

a non-cylindrical profile, which engages in a form-fitting 
manner into the profile on the inner circumference of the 

sleeve (2) after production of the clamping connection. 
Clamping connection according to Claim 1,
 
characterised in that
 
the shaft (12) has an outer toothing (14) which corresponds 

with an inner toothing (15) of the sleeve (2). 
Clamping connection according to Claim 1 or 2,
 
characterised in that
 
the shaft (12) has a multiple-sided profile, in particular 

a three-sided profile, and the inner circumference of the 
sleeve (2) has corresponding grooves. 
Clamping connection according to one of Claims 1-3,
 
characterised in that
  
 

on the outer circumference of the shaft (12) several 
cylinder pins (23) or fitting pins are inserted, and the 

inner circumference of the sleeve (2) has corresponding 
grooves. 
Clamping connection according to one of Claims 1-4,
 
characterised in that profiled multiple-sided projections, 

formed onto the shaft (12), are present, opposed to which 
are associated grooves on the inner circumference of the 

sleeve (2). 
Clamping connection according to one of Claims 1 to 5,
 
characterised in that
 
the shaft (12) is constructed so as to be concave on its 

outer circumference. 
Clamping connection according to one of Claims 1 to 5,
 
characterised in that
 
the shaft (12) in the part surrounded by the sleeve (2) has 

an annular groove into which the sleeve (2) engages. 
Clamping connection according to one of Claims 1 to 7,
 
characterised in that
 
the wedge cams (6) are narrowed conically starting from 

their base (8). 
Clamping connection according to one of Claims 1 to 8,
 
characterised in that
 
for the securing of a device, in particular of a knuckle 

yoke (1), on a profiled outer circumference of the shaft 
(12), the sleeve (2) is connected with the device in one 

piece material or multiple-piece material. 
Clamping device according to one of Claims 1 to 9,
 
characterised in that
 
sleeve (2) and shaft (12) are undetachably connected by 

welding, glueing or rivetting.  
 
Clamping connection according to one of Claims 1 to 10,
 
characterised in that
 
the sleeve is constructed at least in the clamping zone as 

a one-piece, non-slotted part.
