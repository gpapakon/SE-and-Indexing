<ABSTRACT>
The method relates to the transmission, by ATM cells, of information supplied in the form of a series of distinct entities, identically structured and each corresponding to a completely independent data item, for a given application. It provides for transmission of each entity by means of cells, the information field of which is identically composed of modules having a fixed position and a fixed size, a first of which constitutes a cell continuity index, a second of which contains entity data to be transmitted and the last of which is established by means of an error detector-corrector code, of the B.C.H.-block type. A device (4), of the sender type, and a device (11), of the receiver type, include the means essential for implementing the method between a source application (1) and a destination application (2) over an ATM network (3).

A method of transmitting in asynchronous transfer mode (ATM) network cells
analogue information supplied in the form of a series of separate, identically

structured entities each corresponding to a whole, independently usable by a
given application, each cell including a header in which its destination is defined

and an information field, each having a respective standard size, 
characterized
in that
 each entity is transmitted by means of cells whose information field is
identically composed of a plurality of modules each of fixed position and fixed

size, a first of said modules constituting a cell continuity index, modulo "p", which
is incremented for each new cell needed to transmit the same entity in successive

cells, a second of said modules containing entity data to be transmitted, a last
module being made up of a B.C.H. block type error detector-corrector code

obtained by calculation prior to transmission on the basis of the sequence of bits
of other modules of the information field of the cell which includes it, and 
in that

the second module of the information field of the first and the last cells relating
to the same entity respectively include a start of entity marker at the start of the

module and an end of entity marker at the end of the module.
A method according to claim 1 
characterized in that
 the second information
module of the last cell for transferring an entity is padded out to its full capacity

prior to transmission using stuffing bits with the same constitution as the end of
entity marker to preserve the independence of each entity at the source level

during its transmission in asynchronous transfer mode.
A method according to either claim 1 or claim 2 
characterized in that
 at the
receiving end an error marker is substituted for each second information module

received for a series of cells until a start of entity marker is detected in a newly
received second module, starting either from a discontinuity in the incrementing

of the index for a first cell module or from the impossibility of correcting errors
affecting the monitored part of the information field of a cell, this part

comprising the modules of this field other than the last module that it contains.
A transmitter for implementing a transmission method according to at least one
of the preceding claims, 
characterized in that
 it includes entity framing means
(12) for processing digital data relating to each entity supplied by a source

application (1) at a clock rate specific to said source application, adapter buffer
means (13) for processing said digital data at a local processing clock rate (H2)

for packaging it into successive cells, coding means (14) divided into first means 
producing by incrementation the first cell continuity index module and second

means generating an error detector-corrector code module for each cell from the
series of bits intended to constitute the other information field modules supplied

for this cell, the transmitter further including output buffer means (15) for
supplying the cell data under conditions and at a clock rate selected for

transmission.
A receiver for implementing a transmission method according to at least one of
claims 1 to 3 above 
characterized in that
 it includes extractor means (17) at the
receiving end for dissociating the information field of a cell received from the

header of the same cell, input buffer means (18) for processing at a local
processing clock rate (H2') the information field data of cells received, decoder

means (19) adapted to separate the first module and the last module from the
remainder of the information field data of the cells received, and optionally for

reconstituting by means of the corrector code the monitored part of the
information field of a received cell in which not more than two bits are incorrect,

means (21) for checking the continuity of the continuity index modules
successively received, means (20) for separately extracting the second module

from each cell received and output buffer means (22) from which either each
entity is supplied or at least one error marker is supplied substituted for an

erroneous entity either under the control of the decoding means in the case of
reception of an incorrect entity cell that cannot be corrected or under the control

of verification means in the case of an index incrementing discontinuity for a first
cell module of an entity.
