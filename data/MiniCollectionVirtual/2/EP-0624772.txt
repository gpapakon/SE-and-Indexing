<ABSTRACT>
A heat exchanger comprises a bundle of tubes (4) fitted with fins (6), in which the ends (8) of the tubes (4) are mounted in a leaktight manner in the holes (14) of a manifold plate (10) on which a manifold box is mounted. End-stop means (44) are provided between the manifold box (34) and at least one end (8) of the tubes (4).

<CLAIMS>
Heat exchanger, especially for a motor vehicle,
comprising a bank of tubes (4) equipped with fins (6)

in which the extremities (8) of the tubes are mounted
so as to be leaktight in holes (14) of a manifold plate

(10) onto which a manifold box (34) is mounted, and
abutment means (42) provided between the manifold box

(34) and at least one extremity (8) of the tubes (4) in
order to bear on the said extremity, characterised in

that the abutment means issue from the back wall (36)
of the manifold box (34) opposite the manifold plate

(10) so as to bear on a radial surface (46, 60, 64) of
the extremity (8) in such a way as to limit the

shifting, in an axial direction, of the extremity of
the tube with respect to the manifold while the

exchanger is in operation.
Heat exchanger according to Claim 1,
characterised in that the abutment means consist of a

spigot (44).
Heat exchanger according to Claim 1 or 2,
characterised in that the abutment means consist of a

rib (50).
Heat exchanger according to one of the preceding
claims, characterised in that the abutment means (44)

are linked to at least one of the side walls (38, 40)
of the manifold box by a web (54).
Heat exchanger according to one of the preceding
claims, characterised in that the abutment means are

situated between at least two extremities (8) of
adjacent tubes (4).
Heat exchanger according to one of Claims 1 to
5, characterised in that the abutment means bear on the

terminal edge (46) of the extremity (8).
Heat exchanger according to one of the preceding
claims, characterised in that the abutment means (42) 

exhibit a flat surface (48) for bearing on the
extremity (8).
Heat exchanger according to one of Claims 1 to
4, characterised in that the abutment means (42) bear

on a shoulder (60, 64) provided in the extremity (8).
Heat exchanger according to one of the preceding
claims, characterised in that the abutment means bear

on a localised region of the extremity (8).
