<ABSTRACT>
A process for filling an isolation trench with a 
dielectric is described. The deposition pressure of a 

gas from which a silicon dioxide dielectric is deposited 
in a trench is changed on a real-time basis during such 

deposition. Such pressure gradually increases from 
about 20 mTORR to 900 mTORR. The result is that 

particle generation during the initial stages of the 
deposition is maintained at a low rate, while the high 

pressure needed to provide deposition in a trench as it 
is filled is provided.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to the fabrication of 
integrated circuitry and, more particularly, to forming 
a layer of material within and about a cavity in a 
surface of a substrate. There generally are many steps associated with 
fabricating integrated circuitry. Some of these steps 
require forming a layer of material within and about a 
cavity in a surface of a substrate. In this connection, 
it is not unusual in very large scale integration to 
provide isolation trenches between areas of a substrate 
on which differing parts of an integrated circuit are to 
be formed. Such trenches physically and electrically 
isolate the areas. In general, each isolation trench 
includes not only a physical trench-like cavity within 
the substrate, but also a filling within the cavity of 
an insulating material, such as a silicon dioxide. The 
trench is filled with the insulating material by forming 
a layer of the same on the substrate surface within and 
around the trench. One way of forming the layer is to 
deposit the material in a deposition chamber from a gas 
which contains constituents of the desired insulating 
material. For example, if the insulating material is  
 
silicon dioxide, it can be deposited by low pressure 
chemical vapor deposition of silicon and oxygen species 
from tetraethoxysilane (TEOS). The conventional practice is to maintain the gas from 
which the insulating material deposits at a generally 
constant pressure within the deposition chamber. As 
discussed below, this is a relatively high pressure in 
view of the necessity of being reasonably sure that the 
trench fills even though the configuration of the same, 
i.e., the ratio of the depth of the trench to its width 
(its minimum opening width) changes during the formation 
of the filling layer. This ratio is typically referred 
to as the aspect ratio. That is, as also discussed 
below, it will be seen that as the deposition 
progresses, this aspect ratio changes dramatically - as 
the layer is formed, the width of the opening narrows 
dramatically relative to the depth of the trench. That 
is, in order to effectively fill the trench, molecules 
have to be able to penetrate the trench and make their 
way to the bottom without incurring heavy losses due to 
reactions with the side walls. While increase in pressure has a beneficial effect on 
trench filling capacity in view of this problem, it has 
the unfortunate adverse effect of particle generation. 
That is, as pressure increases more particles are  
 
generated due to an

A process of forming a layer of material within

surface after deposition of said material on said 

surface has started.
