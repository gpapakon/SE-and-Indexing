<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a continuous process for producing sheets out of cured polymethacrylate casting resins A), if appropriate containing inorganic fillers B) by polymerisation of the casting resins on heatable and coolable metallic conveyor belts, having the features that the conveyor belts are covered by a plastic, selected from the group of polyolefins, halogenated polyolefins, polyesters or polyamides, and also that the speed of the conveyor belts vs, the temperature difference  DELTA T between the temperature at the centre of the cast sheet and the temperature T of the coolant respectively at the end of the cooling section s are combined with one another by a logic operation.
