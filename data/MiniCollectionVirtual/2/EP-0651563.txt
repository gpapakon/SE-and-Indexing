<ABSTRACT>
This invention minimizes the visibility of quantization 
artifacts associated with multi-dimensional color-calibration 

look-up tables (46) of a limited size. Such artifacts occur when 
it is not practical to use interpolation methods to 

approximate color values which are intermediate to the color 
values stored in the look-up table. In such cases the input 

color signals are simply quantized for the purpose of 
addressing the look-up table. This invention works by 

applying (42) local mean preserving spatial modulation 
e.g. a periodic dither pattern, to the input 

color image values prior to the quantization step (44). 
In another embodiment the quantization error is diffused to nearly 

unprocessed pixels. 
As with 

multi-level halftoning techniques, the result is that the 
appearance of intermediate color values is created because the 

observer will spatially average the output color values.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to the field of 
digital color imaging systems, and more specifically to a 
process of performing color-calibration and/or color space 
transformations so as to minimize color errors and 
contouring. In a digital color imaging system, a color image 
is represented as a set of color picture elements 
("pixels"). Each pixel has associated with it a set of 
color values which describe the color (hue, saturation and 
lightness) for that position in the image. The color values 
correspond to the color coordinates in some given color 
space. There are many different color spaces (e.g. RGB, CIE 
tristimulus (XYZ), CIELAB, CIELUV, CMY(K), etc.) which are 
commonly used. Some color spaces, such as XYZ, CIELAB, and 
CIELUV are device independent and will therefore give an 
absolute measure of the color for each pixel in the image. 
Others, such as RGB and CMY(K), are device dependent and can 
only be related to an absolute color value if the spectral 
characteristics of a specific device are known. For many applications it may be necessary to be 
able to take color image data from one device and display, 
manipulate, and/or print it on another device which may have 
very different spectral characteristics. For this reason, 
it is often necessary to be able to take image data in one 
color space, and convert it to a different color space. For 
example, it may be required to take RGB data from an input 
scanner and convert it to a device independent space such as 
CIELAB. This device independent data could then be used by 
a variety of different output devices which could then 
convert the data to their own device dependent color space  
 
for display. This permits the various devices to be 
calibrated so that the image will have the same color 
appearance regardless of what output device is used. The transformation from one color system to 
another relates the coordinates in one space to those in a 
different color space. In some cases, this color 
transformation may be as simple as a matrix multiplication, 
as in the case of transforming from a video RGB space to 
XYZ. In other cases the transformation is more complex, 
such as when transforming CIELAB into CMY(K). A technique which is used in many applications to 
implement various color space transformations is a multi-dimensional 
color-calibration look-up table. This approach 
has the advantage over other methods, such as matrix 
techniques, that very general color transformations can be 
specified. This is particularly helpful
