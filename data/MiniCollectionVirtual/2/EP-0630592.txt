<ABSTRACT>
Improved sports footwear comprising an insert positioned at least 
in the heel region, the insert comprising an elastically 

deformable cellular structure arranged within an elastically 
deformable air-impermeable casing provided with inner projections 

on opposing faces, the casing being pneumatically connected to 
controllable means, rigid with the footwear, for varying the air 

pressure within the casing so as to modify the elastic 
characteristics of the insert, each projection on one face being 

connected to a projection on the other face.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to improved footwear for athletes, of the type containing
an insert at least in the heel region of the sole, the insert comprising a airtight
flexible plastics casing enclosing elastically deformable means. An example of this
type of footwear is disclosed in US-A 5.092.060.It is well known that athletics footwear must provide a stable support region
which at the same time is comfortable for the foot and hence for the athlete's body,
which is subjected to the most various types of stress. To solve the problem of
comfort with stable support, while also achieving a certain counter thrust effect, ie
a partial recovery of the thrust as the footwear separates from the ground plus
absorption of the impact against the ground, solutions of the type described in the
preceding paragraph have been proposed.The known-art inserts (see e.g. US-A 5.092.060) positioned in the footwear
heel of the sole act primarily as a comply spring, so that after the impact of the
footwear against the ground and the simultaneous damping affect, there is partial
restitution of the energy absorbed by the insert on impact. Although the known
inserts offer comfort, stability and adequate damping ad energy recovery through
a certain range of loading and impact velocity, they can prove partially
unsatisfactory outside these rages. For example, footwear provided with the insert
in question can satisfy the requirements of slow movement but not of fast
movement, whereas an insert designed for fast movement could prove too rigid for
slow movement. In addition to this, for equal footwear see the weight of the
wearer can vary within extremely wide limits, so that the same insert can prove 
either excessively rigid or excessively yielding.The main object of the present invention is therefore to improve footwear
provided with an insert of the type comprising an airtight casing of flexible material
enclosing a plurality of interconnected elastic bodies, such that its rigidity can be
matched both to the weight of the user and to the pace of movement at any given
time.A further object of the present invention is to provide footwear with a airtight
insert of reduced weight.A further object of the present invention is to provide footwear with several
inserts positioned in regions of the footwear which are convenient for comfort and
stability.The aforesaid objects are attained according to the invention by the
inprovements recited in the attached claims.Document US-A 4.462.171 discloses a footwear having a compartmentalized,

<CLAIMS>
Improved sports footwear comprising
a vamp (2) and a sole (3) portion and having

at least one insert (4)
positioned at least in the heel region

of said sole (3),
said insert comprising an

air-impermeable casing (6) of flexible material and containing
elastically deformable means

(5,55),
characterised in that means

(29,36,25,19)
are

connected to said casing for varying the air pressure within said
casing, so as to modify the elastic characteristics of the insert.
Sports footwear as claimed in claim 1, characterised in
that said means for varying the air pressure within the insert

comprise pumping means
(29)

associated with intake and delivery valve
means

(25,36)
for increasing said pressure, and bleed means

(19)
for decreasing

said pressure.
Sports footwear as claimed in claim 2, characterised in
that the pumping means and the bleed means are both positioned on

the outside of the footwear and are rigid therewith.
Sports footwear as claimed in claim 3, characterised in
that the pumping means and the bleed means are contained within an

elastically deformable cover (45) rigid with the footwear.
Sports footwear as claimed in claim 2, characterised in
that the pumping means comprise a bellows having two openings

(30,35),
one

containing an intake valve (36) and the other containing a delivery
valve (25).
Sports footwear as claimed in claim 5, characterised in
that the delivery valve is a lip-type valve and is positioned

within a block (116) to which the bellows is connected, this block also
containing the bleed means downstream of said delivery valve.
Sports footwear as claimed in claim 6, characterised in 
that the bleed means comprise a pusher-type valve.
Sports footwear as claimed in claim 1, characterised in
that the elastically deformable means are represented by a

cellular structure (5), preferably of honeycomb type.
Sports footwear as claimed in claim 8, characterised in
that the air-impermeable casing of flexible material is formed

from at least two parts
(6A,6B)

each comprising an integral appendix which
when joined together form a tube for air passage from and to the

insert.
Sports footwear as claimed in claim 9, characterised in
that said two parts comprise, in coinciding positions, hollow

projections (9) which are directed towards the interior of the casing
and are connec
ted together at their inner ends.
Sports footwear as claimed in claim 10, characterised in
that at least one pair of joined-together hollow projections is

arranged within a cell (5A) of the cellular structure.
Sports footwear as claimed in claim 8, characterised in
that the cellular structure is enclosed within, but not connected

to, the air-impermeable casing.
