<ABSTRACT>
Processes for detecting the presence of neoplastic disease are provided. The processes involve the detection of a product associated with expression of genes that encode protein receptors for fibroblast growth factor in cells or a product indicative of elevated levels of a fibroblast growth factor receptor in a body fluid. Detection can be carried out in a variety of ways, including hybridization to detect the presence of mRNA encoding a growth factor receptor or immunological assays to detect the presence of receptor protein. Kits for performing the processes are also provided.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to processes for diagnosing cancer. In a 
more specific aspect it relates to methods for detecting melanoma. Despite improvements in surgical and radiological procedures and 
an increasingly large arsenal of drugs for treating cancer, cures for the 
many malignant neoplastic diseases remain elusive. The strides that have 
been made in reducing mortality have come largely from education 
programs that have heightened public awareness of the need for routine 
physical examination and improved techniques for detecting the presence 
of neoplastic disease at a sufficiently early stage to provide a favorable 
prognosis. Such improved techniques include immunoassays for tumor 
associated antigens, such as carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) and 
alphafetoprotein (AFP), and nucleic acid hybridization techniques. Nucleic 
acid hybridization can be used, for example, to diagnose the presence of 
chromosomal translocations associated with certain forms of cancer, 
such chromosomal translocations associated with chronic myelogenous 
leukemia (CML). Successful techniques, however, are rare. Accordingly, there remains a pressing need for better cancer 
diagnostics. For example, if detected before metastasis, malignant 
melanoma is an excellent example of a virulent cancer that is treatable by  
 
surgical removal with a high rate of success. After metastasis, however, 
the five year mortality rate using available chemotherapy and radiotherapy 
techniques is a shocking 97-99% (6,500 deaths in the United States in 
1991). The shortcomings of modern treatments for melanoma take on 
heightened significance when it is appreciated that the incidence of this 
once relatively rare cancer is increasing annually at a rate of 4-10%, with 
32,000 new cases in the United States in 1991. Early detection of melanoma is complicated because many 
melanomas presented for diagnosis are either atypical in appearance in 
that they appear identical to non-melanocytic lesions or are obscured by 
inflammation. Some melanomas are completely amelanotic 
(non-pigmented) and others are histologically similar to benign 
melanocytic growths. Thus, using classical histological techniques, it is 
frequently impossible to determine whether a lesion is actually a 
melanoma or whether it is a benign melanocytic growth or other type of 
carcinoma, for example a sarcoma. In many cases, particularly those in which histological examination 
of biopsy material is used, it remains difficult to classify the kind of tumor 
which may be

A process for detecting a neoplastic disease in a subject, comprising 
detecting, in a tissue or body fluid sample obtained from the subject, elevated 

expression of a fibroblast growth factor receptor (FGFR) gene or elevated 
amounts of (fibroblast growth factor receptor) FGFR protein, wherein: 


the amounts or expression are elevated compared to the amounts or 
expression in a sample from a subject in whom the neoplastic disease is not 

present; and 
detection of the elevated amounts or expression indicates the presence of 
a neoplastic disease in the subject. 
The process of claim 1, wherein detection is accomplished by: 

(a) contacting a sample obtained from said subject with an agent that 
specifically binds to either FGFR or to nucleic acid encoding FGFR; and 
(b) detecting any binding of said agent to the FGFR or nucleic acid, 
wherein elevated amount binding indicates the presence of a neoplastic disease. 
The process of claim 2, wherein said agent is an antibody or 
a functional fragment thereof. 
The process of claim 2, wherein said agent is a nucleic acid 
probe. 
The process of claim 2, wherein said agent is labelled with a 
detectable marker. 
The process of any of claims 1-5, wherein the FGFR protein is 
detected. 
The process of any of claims 1, 2, 5 and 6, wherein the 
process is an immunoassay. 
The process of claim 7, comprising: treating a paraffin-fixed 
section of biopsy material with an antibody having specific reactivity with 

the receptor protein, removing unbound antibody from the section and 
detecting the antibody bound to receptor protein present in the section, 

wherein the detection of antibody bound to said receptor protein indicates 
the presence of neoplastic disease in said subject.  

 
The process of claim 8, wherein the bound antibody is 
detected by: 


(a) incubating the section with a second antibody that binds to 
the first antibody, wherein said second antibody is detectably labelled; 
(b) removing unbound second antibody from the section; and 
(c) detecting complexes containing the second antibody. 
The process of any of claims 1, 2 and 4-6, wherein mRNA 
or cDNA that encodes the FGFR protein is detected. 
A process according to claim 10, wherein the mRNA or 
cDNA is jetected by hybridization with a detectable nucleic acid probe 

having a nucleotide sequence sufficiently complementary to at least a 
portion of the mRNA or cDNA to hybridize thereto.

bio inylated. 
The process of claim 4 or claim 11, wherein the probe is 
labeled with digoxin. 
The process of any of claims 11-13, wherein hybridization of 
the probe to mRNA in the sample is detected by: 


(a) removal of unbound probe from the section; 
(b) incubation of the section with a complex of avidin or 
streptavidin and alkaline phosphatase; 
(c) removal of unbound avidin or streptavidin/alkaline 
phosphatase complex from the section; 
(d) treatment of the section with a color forming substrate for 
alkaline phosphatase;
