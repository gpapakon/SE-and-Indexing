<ABSTRACT>
A reduced size three-terminal type capacitor for removing 
jamming signals from an electrical signal. The three-terminal 

type capacitor comprises a ceramic substrate (21) with a first ground 
electrode layer (22) formed on the ceramic substrate, and a first 

dielectric layer (23) formed on the first ground electrode layer. On 
the first dielectric layer (23) reaching at least from one end of the 

first dielectric layer (23) to the other end is a one piece signal 
electrode (24). A second dielectric layer (25) is formed on the first 

dielectric layer (23) to surround the signal electrode (24) together with 
the first dielectric layer (23), 

and a second ground electrode layer (26) 
is formed on the second dielectric layer together with the first 

ground electrode layer (22). The second ground electrode layer (26) is 
electrically connected to the first ground electrode layer (22). T
he 
structure of this three-terminal capacitor is such that first and 

second dielectric layers (23,25) are surrounded 
by mutually conducting first and second electrode layers (22,26) so that 

jamming signal removal is superior to that of the conventional 
printed type capacitor.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a three-terminal type capacitor, a
three-terminal type capacitor array, and an assembly for removing
jamming signals incorporating the three-terminal capacitor and/or
array. The capacitor and capacitor array of this invention are
suited for removing jamming signals generated by the electric
circuit which includes the capacitor or jamming signals received
from other electric circuits, such as in electrical appliances
like television sets.Recently, as digital circuits in electrical appliances
become smaller in size and greater in function the parts used in
them for removing jamming signals must also be smaller in size
and have a superior ability to remove jamming signals. As a
representative example of prior art systems for removing jamming
signals, the assembly of FIG. 1 shows a disk-shaped feed-through
capacitor 5 comprising a signal electrode 1, a dielectric 2, and
a ground electrode 3. As shown in FIG. 2, feed-through capacitor
5 is attached to the input/output terminals of a metal shield
case 4 incorporating electric circuits.In this type of conventional jamming signal removal device,
the spacing of signal lines is determined by the size of the
feed-through capacitor 5. Therefore, when the number of signal
lines increases the number of feed-through capacitors 5 contained
in the metal shield case 4 increases and the size of the jamming
signal assembly becomes very large. Further, the manufacturing
efficiency of the jamming signal assembly is reduced due to the 
increased number of feed-through capacitors because each feed-through
capacitor 5 must be individually soldered to metal shield
case 4.Japanese Patent Publication No. 4-32170, represented by the
drawing of FIG. 3, discloses a reduced size assembly for removing
jamming signal comprising a terminal strip mounting a printed
type capacitor on a metal shield case. The terminal strip is
made by sequentially forming a first electrode layer 12, which is
a ground electrode of the capacitor, on a ceramic substrate 11
having a penetration hole 15, and a dielectric layer 13. A
second electrode layer 14 is soldered on dielectric layer 13 and
around penetration hole 15, and a pin terminal 16 is inserted
into the penetration hole 15. The terminal strip is fixed in a
metal shield case (not shown) by a protrusion 17 of the metal
shield case. Although the terminal strip of FIG. 3 can be
reduced in size, the performance of jamming signal removal is
reduced because the dielectric layer 13 is not wrapped in first
electrode layer 12
