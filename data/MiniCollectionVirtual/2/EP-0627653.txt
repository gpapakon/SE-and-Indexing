<ABSTRACT>
A paper mask device (1) in which the position of 
longitudinal masks (2a,2b) can be changed without damaging a web of 

printing paper. When it is changed from the borderless 
printing to the printing with border, one ends of the 

longitudinal masks (2a,2b) are moved inwardly toward each other by 
means of a first transfer unit (9a) while keeping the other ends 

overlapped on the edges of the printing paper. A second 
transfer unit (9b) then operates to move the other ends of the 

longitudinal masks (2a,2b) inwardly to set the width of the print 
size. The longitudinal masks (2a,2b) can be overlapped on both 

edges of the printing paper without damaging it.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a paper mask device according to the preamble of claim 1, used
when negative images on a negative film are printed on a
web of printing paper.Fig. 6 shows a conventional paper mask device of the type referred to above. Under
a negative mask 30 holding a negative film F is provided a
light source 31 which illuminates the negative film F. A
negative image on the negative film F is printed on a web
of printing paper A through a pair of reflective mirrors 32
and 33. In such a printing apparatus, a paper mask 34 is
mounted on the web of printing paper A to set the print
size.The paper mask 34 shown in Fig. 7 is known. It is
provided over the web of printing paper A fed in one way
and comprises a pair of longitudinal strip-like masking plates 35a and 35b, and
a pair of transverse strip-like masking plates 36a and 36b. The longitudinal
masking plates 35a and 35b are moved relative to each other by a
single transfer unit 37, and the transverse masking plates 36a and
36b are similarly moved relative to each other by a single
transfer unit 38.In each of the transfer units 37 and 38, an endless
belt 41 is stretched around a pair of pulleys 39 and 40.
The pulley 39 is driven by a motor 42.With the paper mask 34, when the borderless printing 
is to be carried out, both of the longitudinal masking plates 35a
and 35b are positioned outside of both edges of the web of
printing paper A. For the printing with border, the
longitudinal masking plates 35a and 35b are moved toward each other
to mask both edges of the printing paper A, and the
transverse masking plates 36a and 36b are moved inwardly toward each
other. The printing with border is then carried out.With such a conventional paper mask device, the
longitudinal masking plates 35a and 35b are moved toward and away
from each other. Let us suppose that the web of the
printing paper is curved in a width direction as shown in
Fig. 8A. When it is changed from the borderless printing
to the printing with border, the longitudinal masking plates 35a and
35b, while moved inwardly toward each other, are likely to
abut both edges of the web of printing paper A inwardly and
damage it as shown in Fig. 8B. US 4 320 965 describes an automatic masking device for use in a
printer, wherein a reproduction picture to be projected onto a
photosensitive film sheet mounted on a holder is masked by a
pair of masking plates, which are separated at a certain distance
away from the surface of the photosensitive film sheet.
The masking plates are adapted to be movable

<CLAIMS>
A paper mask device (1) for determining and changing the
printing size of an image printed on a web of printing

paper (A), said device (1) comprising a pair of
longitudinal strip-like masking plates (2a,2b) adapted

to be arranged in a longitudinal direction of said web
of printing paper (A), and a pair of transverse strip-like

masking plates (3a,3b) adapted to be arranged in a
transverse direction of said web of printing paper (A),

and a transfer unit (4a,4b,9a,9b) for moving said
longitudinal masking plates (2a,2b) relative to each

other for increasing or decreasing the distance
therebetween, and for moving said transverse masking

plates (3a,3b) relative to each other for increasing or
decreasing the distance therebetween,
characterised in that

said transfer unit includes a first transfer unit (9a) for moving the first ends of
said longitudinal masking plates (2a,2b) relative to

each other and a second transfer unit (9b) for moving
the second ends of said longitudinal masking plates

(2a,2b) relative to each other said first
and second transfer units (9a,9b) are operable

independently from one another, and each of said longitudinal
masking plates (2a,2b) is pivotably coupled at its first and second ends to said

first and second transfer units (9a,9b), respectively, so that said
longitudinal masking plates (2a,2b) are adapted to take

oblique positions with respect to each other. 
The device of claim 1, wherein said first and said
second ends of each of said longitudinal masking plates

(2a,2b) are pivotably connected to a coupling piece
(14,15,17,18) of said first and said second transfer units, respectively, by a pin (16,19).
The device of claim 2, wherein said second end of each of said
longitudinal masking plates (2a,2b) includes an

elongated pin hole (20) extending in the longitudinal
direction of the respective masking plate (2a,2b) for receiving

said pin (19).
A method of determining and changing the printing size
of an image printed on a web of paper (A) by means of

the paper mask device of any one of claims 1 to 3,
comprising the steps of:


placing said web of paper (A) in said paper mask device
(1);
moving said first ends of said longitudinal masking
plates (2a,2b) relative to each other for positioning

said longitudinal masking plates (2a,2b) obliquely with
respect to each other and with respect to the

longitudinal direction of said web of paper (A); and
thereafter moving said second ends of said longitudinal
masking plates (2a,2b) relative to each other for

positioning said longitudinal masking plates (2a,2b)
parallel to each other and to the longitudinal direction

of said web of paper (A).
