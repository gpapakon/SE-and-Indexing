<ABSTRACT>
A scroll type compressor comprises a fixed scroll (1) having an 
end plate (1a) and a spiral element (1b). The spiral element of the 

fixed scroll is integrally coupled to the inner wall (1d) of a 
housing. A movable scroll (9) has an end plate (9a) and a spiral 

element (9b), and faces the fixed scroll, with a plurality of fluid 
pockets formed between the movable scroll and the fixed 

scroll. When the movable scroll makes an orbital movement 
around the axis of the rotary shaft, refrigerant gas is led 

into the fluid pockets from outside the movable scroll. As 
the fluid pockets move toward the center of the movable scroll 

the fluid pockets decrease in volume, thereby compressing the 
refrigerant gas. A suction chamber (12) which receives the 

refrigerant gas from outside the housing is formed between the 
movable scroll and the inner wall (1d) of the housing. A passage (1f) 

is formed in at least one of the inner wall of the housing, 
the connecting (1e) section and the end plate of the movable 

scroll. This passage permits the refrigerant gas to flow into 
the fluid pockets from the suction chamber in order to reduce 

any difference in pressure of the refrigerant gas in the 
suction chamber and in the fluid pocket.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention generally relates to a scroll type
compressor and in particular to a scroll type compressor used
in an air conditioning system of a vehicle.Typical components of a conventional scroll type compressor
include a fixed scroll formed with a spiral element provided
on the surface of a fixed end plate and a movable scroll
formed with a spiral element provided on the surface of a
movable end plate. Both spiral elements are interfit and
disposed in a housing such that one spiral element's side wall
contacts various portions of the other spiral element's side
wall. As a result, fluid pockets form between the two spiral
elements. A suction chamber, defined between the interfit
spiral elements and the inner wall of the housing, supplies
refrigerant gas to the fluid pockets when the movable scroll
rotates. As the fluid pockets move toward the center of the
spiral elements, the volume of the fluid pocket decreases, and
in that way, the scroll elements compress the refrigerant gas.
The compressed refrigerant gas is then discharged into a
discharge chamber located in the aforementioned housing via
a discharge port formed in the center portion of the fixed 
scroll's end plate.To reduce the weight of these scroll type compressors, the
fixed scroll can be made from a light weight metal, such as
aluminum or from an aluminum-nickel alloy. The compressor's
housing can likewise be made from a light weight metal in
order to achieve weight reduction. Japanese Unexamined Patent
Publication No. 61-38189 discloses such a housing and fixed
scroll formed as separate components. Even further reduction
in weight can be accomplished by decreasing the overall size
of the compressor, as well as by integrating the housing and
fixed scroll into a single component, as disclosed, for
example, in Japanese Unexamined Patent Publication No. 3-134287
and Japanese Unexamined Utility Model Publication No.
5-1882.Scroll type compressors, having separately formed housing and
fixed scroll components, enjoy a high degree of design
freedom, by being able to use a large cross-sectional area for
the refrigerant gas to pass from the suction chamber to the
fluid pocket. This helps to assure proper displacement of
refrigerant gas from the suction chamber into the fluid
pockets.In order to enhance the strength of the fixed spiral element, 
in the case where the fixed scroll is integrally formed with
the housing, the outer tip portion of the fixed spiral element
can be made thicker, relative to other portions, with the
thick portion
