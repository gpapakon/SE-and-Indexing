<ABSTRACT>
This invention refers to an anti-bending corrugating 
system for metallic containers which can be applied to 

all kind of metallic containers (1) of a shape that can be 
either trunco-pyramidal, prismatic, elliptical or similar 

to correct the usual bending produced when the body of 
the container (1) is expanded, and it comprises two or more 

similar corrugations (3) opposite one to the other and made 
on certain areas of the side wall of the body of the 

container (1), the number of corrugations depending on the 
size of the relevant deformation causing the bending (2). It 

has been foreseen that the corrugations (3) are parallel to 
the base to absorb the excess material originated during 

the manufacturing expansion stage of the container (1) 
itself.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention refers to a anti-bending corrugating system
for metallic containers, the aim of which is to prevent
the usual bending that normally appears in the metallic
containers during the expansion operations carried out to
obtaining or manufacturing such containers.The corrugating system can be applied to all kind of
metallic containers of a shape that can be either trunco-pyramidal,
parallelopipedic, elliptical, etc.As everybody knows, when the body of a metallic container
is expanded, a deformation occurs due to stress of the
material. Such deformation is called "bending" and
happens in the bottom causing an uneven distribution of
material in the periphery of the body of the container.In the light of the above and to proceed with the
manufacturing of the container it is necessary to correct
such bending so that the whole periphery of the container
is parallel, thus enabling such deformation to disappear.Currently, there are two systems aimed to achieve the
correction of the bending. The first one consists of
cutting the material with its periphery already compensated
prior to proceed to weld the body and its subsequent
expansion. The second system consists of expanding the
body of the container with concave expanding tools so
that they can proportionately compensate the subsequent
deformation.In the first case, we find the inconvenience of the loss
of material, while in the second one the inconvenience
stems from a bad or defective configuration of the 
container itself.Document EP-A-0 448 436 corresponds to the preamble portion of
claim 1. However, only one recessed ring is provided with a
depth increasing correspondingly with the bending deformation of
the container.The system proposed has been conceived to satisfactorily
solve all those problems on the basis of a simple and
efficient solution which the added advantage - when
compared with the first conventional system referred
above - of a better use of the raw material which, in
turn and compared with the second conventional system,
enables to obtain a more even and straight configuration
of the wall of the container which makes the storage of
the containers much easier.These features or advantages are achieved by using the
system which is the object of claim 1 of this invention. This
consists of making two or more corrugations of the same
dimension but opposite to each other so that such
corrugations determine the folding of the excess material
just in the areas where such excess has been produced.Once the deformation or bending has been

<CLAIMS>
A metallic expanded container (1) comprising a body
the side wall (4) of which has an uneven distribution of

material on the periphery of its base, so-called bending
deformation (2), and a corrugating means for compensating

this bending, wherein said bending deformation results in
excess material at the corners of the sidewall (4),

characterized in that said means comprises at the corners
two or more similar narrow corrugations (3) extending

opposite to each other with regard to the sidewall (4)
for folding the excess material at the corners with a

more even and straight configuration of the sidewall (4),
wherein said corrugations (3) are parallel to the base of

the container (1), and the number of corrugations (3)
depends on the size (a) of the bending deformation (2)

resulting form the expansion of the container.
A metallic expanded container according to claim 1,
characterized in that all the corrugations (3) have a

constant narrow depth (b).
A metallic expanded container according to any of the
foregoing claims, characterized in that each corrugation

(3) has a constant height (c).
