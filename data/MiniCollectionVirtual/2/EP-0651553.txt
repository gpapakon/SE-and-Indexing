<ABSTRACT>
An electronic camera for providing a device for 
rapidly inputting various useful attributes of an image 

comprises an image signal processing circuit for 
selectively processing an image signal in one of a 

plurality of image pick-up and signal processing modes, 
and a circuit for recording a processed image signal in 

a main file area or an attribute file area whereby the 
attribute of the image file can be readily recorded 

according to a selective process by the image signal 
processing circuit. 
It further comprises a circuit for transferring 
data or program from an image pick-up unit to a RAM or 

between a recording medium and the RAM, a circuit for 
storing whether a program for controlling and 

processing the mode is a built-in program or an 
external program. In the image pick-up in the mode 

with the external program being designated, the program 
is transferred from the recording medium to the RAM and 

then the control is shifted to the program so that 
various processing as the attribute (or the image) can 

be made.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an electronic
camera.A prior art electronic camera for digital
recording is constructed as shown in Fig. 1.In Fig. 1, an image through an optical lens 1
is picked up by an image pick-up device and processed
for CDS or AGC by a circuit 3 and amplified to a
predetermined level by a pre-amplifier circuit 4.
Then, it passed through an A/D conversion circuit 5 and
a processing circuit 5' and is temporarily stored in a
memory 6. It is compressed by a compression circuit 7
before it is recorded on a medium 8. Numeral 9 denotes
a memory controller and numeral 10 denotes a system
controller.The electronic camera of this construction is
sufficient to "photograph" an image but has a
limitation as an apparatus for acquiring further
information. Namely, since it does not accompany
information as to detailed information of the
"photograph", memory or memorandum of a photographer is
required when the "photograph" is to be subsequently
processed or edited, which significantly reduces the 
efficiency.In such a prior art electronic camera, camera
processes controlled by the system controller are fixed
in ROM as firmware, and the manner in which the camera
records is predetermined when it is manufactured in a
plant so that the camera cannot meet different types of
requirements.It is a concern of the present invention to
alleviate the problems encountered in the prior art
electronic camera.US Patent Specification No. US-A-5039847 discloses
an apparatus capable of reading and processing both
character data and image data using a single scanner so
that image data and information obtained by image
recognition can be stored separately or together.According to the present invention, there is
provided an electronic camera as set out in claim 1.An embodiment of the present invention allows
information other than 'photograph' to be accompanied in
an image file and the generation of various sorts of
information without fixing a generation method of the
information on firmware. Thus, the information describing the image such
as merchandise management information represented by a
bar code or title and names derived by character
recognition can be easily linked to a target image so
that the apparatus is very useful as an input device
for later retrieving or information-managing the image.Other concerns and features of the present
invention will be apparent from the following
description of the invention and the accompanying
drawings.Fig. 1 shows a configuration of a prior art
electronic camera.Fig. 2

<CLAIMS>
An electronic camera comprising:

image pickup means (1,2,3) for receiving light from
an image and outputting an image signal corresponding

thereto; and
a connector (12) for receiving from an external
source both information for setting a camera mode and for setting a

character recognition program;
a first memory (11) for storing the received
camera mode setting information;
a second memory (8) for storing
a character recognition program and the corresponding setting information received by said connector

and for storing an image signal in a main file area of a main file and for additionally storing a
pattern recognised image signal in an attribute file area

of the main file;
a third memory (7) for storing a built-in
photography mode control program;
a designator (14) for designating either a
photography mode or a character recognition mode of

operation of the camera; and
signal processing circuitry (1,10) for processing 
the image signal output from said image pickup means as

a photograph in accordance with the camera mode
setting information stored in said first memory

and the built-in photography mode control program stored in said third memory and
for storing the processed image signal in the main file area of the main file in the

second memory when said
designating means designates the photography mode, and

for processing the image signal output from said image pickup means as
character signal in accordance with the character recognition program and corresponding setting

information stored in the second memory and for storing the character recognised
image signal as pattern recognised image signal in the attribute file area of

the main file in the second memory when said designating means designates
the character recognition mode.
A camera according to claim 1, wherein said third
memory stores a built-in bar code control program, and

wherein said designator is adapted to additionally designate a bar
code mode, and wherein said signal processing circuitry

processes the image signal output from said image pickup means as a bar code signal according to the built-in bar code control program when said
designator has designated the bar code mode.
A camera according to claim 1 or claim 2, further
comprising a RAM (6), and wherein said signal processing

circuitry transfers the character recognition program
from said second memory to said RAM when said designator

designates the character recognition mode.
A camera according to any one of claims 1 to 3,
further comprising a cable for coupling said connector to

a personal computer external source.
