<ABSTRACT>
To provide a novel cyclohexane derivative, a 
cyclohexane derivative is defined by the formula (I) 

or a pharmacologically acceptable salt thereof: 

(wherein R¹ and R² may be the same or different from 
each other and each represents hydrogen or lower 

alkyl; R³ represents optionally substituted aryl or 
optionally substituted heteroaryl; X represents oxygen 

or sulfur; and Y represents a group represented by the 
formula: 


or the like). The compound of the present invention

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a cyclohexane 
derivative useful as drugs. More particularly, it 
relates to a cyclohexane derivative exhibiting a 
potassium channel opening activity. Asthma is a considerably long known disease which 
has paroxysmal dyspnea due to the reversible structure 
of the respiratory tract and stridor as main signs, 
but the cause thereof has not been elucidated as yet. Asthma is generally classified depending upon 
disease type into atopic asthma, infectious asthma and 
combined asthma which is infection-exacerbated atopic 
asthma. However, these types of asthma are little 
different from each other in the symptoms and pneumo-physiological 
changes at attack, the therapy of attack 
or the like, and the frequency of the coexistence of 
hypersensitivity of the respiratory tract with allergy 
is too high to be regarded as accident. Therefore, 
doctors and research workers who participate in the 
treatment of asthma generally believe that various 
types of asthma result in one disease. The methods for treating the above types of  
 
asthma is now roughly classified into three groups. 
One of the groups is so-called hyposensitization 
therapy, which is now regarded as the best one, but is 
disadvantageous in that it is generally inefficiacious 
against infectious asthma. Another of the groups is nonspecific therapy and 
representative examples thereof include the 
administration of a gold salt or γ-globulin and 
vaccination. However, most of these, therapeutic 
methods are disadvantageous in that the mechanism of 
action is not known. The third group is symptomatic therapy, which 
refers mainly to medication, though it includes 
various methods. Examples of the drug to be used for 
this purpose include β-stimulants such as 
isoproterenol and salbutamol; stabilizers for mast 
cell membrane such as disodium cromoglicate; xanthine 
preparations such as theophylline and aminophylline; 
and steroid preparations. However, the β-stimulants 
cause side effects such as arrhythmia, hypertension 
and headache; the xanthine preparations cause side 
effects such as gastrointestinal diseases and 
neuropathy; and the steroid preparations cause potent 
side effects such as diabetes mellitus and 
osteoporosis. Therefore, care must be taken in the  
 
administration of these drugs. Further, the 
stabilizers for mast cell membrane are disadvantageous 
in that they can be administered only as an inhalant 
and therefore are difficult to administer to children 
and the aged, that they are inefficacious
