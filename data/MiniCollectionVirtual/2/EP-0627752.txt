<ABSTRACT>
An inertia device for disconnecting the battery at least from the 
main power line of an internal combustion engine vehicle, 

comprising an inertia switch, an electromagnet, and a armature 
with stop seats for a rod or pushbutton provided with chordal 

projections and carrying a movable contact (4), in which the 
armature is in the form of a single piece of ferromagnetic 

material, and comprises two flanges (27) provided with the seats 
and positioned on opposite sides of the rod or pushbutton.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to an inertia device for interrupting the 
electrical circuit of vehicles with internal combustion engines, according to 
the preamble of claim 1. An inertia device is known for interrupting the electrical 
connection between the battery and the power line of an internal 
combustion engine vehicle in the case of accidents of a certain 
gravity in order to reduce the risk of fire. The known device comprises an electromagnet acting on an armature 
hinged to the device casing and arranged to break the electrical 
connection. This armature comprises a metal or tongue part which 
is pulled by the electromagnet and is rigid with one end of a ring 
or rod movable against a spring and carrying the movable contact 
which effectively makes and breaks said electrical connection. 
Specifically, the pushbutton comprises chordal projections which, 
depending on the state of the electrical connection, engage 
against abutment surfaces provided at different axial distances in 
seats present in said plastics ring. A compression spring 
operates in an opposite position to the metal tongue in an  
 
eccentric part of said ring, and bears against the casing. This known device has certain drawbacks, as follows: 
a) assembly is relatively difficult as the pushbutton has to be 
inserted into the plastics ring of the armature and the 
combination mounted in one of the half-casings of which the casing 
is formed, against the action of springs acting both on the 
armature and on the pushbutton, these springs being difficult to 
seat and tending to snap out into the surroundings. b) in particular situations the plastics-plastics contact 
(between diametrical projections on the pushbutton and ring, and 
the seats with which the projections cooperate) does not 
sufficiently reliably ensure disengagement between the two, with 
consequent faulty breaking of the electrical connection. In the case of fire in the vehicle, the said plastics-plastics 
combination can lead to jamming of the device. The aforesaid drawbacks are obviated by the features claimed in the characterizing portion of claim 1. The invention will be more apparent from the detailed description 
given hereinafter by way of example with reference to the 
accompanying drawing, in which: 
Figure 1 is a schematic illustration of the inertia device of the 
invention with one of its two half-casings removed; and Figure 2 is a perspective schematic view of the armature. In the figures the reference numeral 1 indicates one of the two  
 
half-casings
</DESCRIPTION>
<CLAIMS>
An inertia device for disconnecting the battery, 
at least from the main power line, of an internal 

combustion engine vehicle, comprising an inertia switch 
(8), an electromagnet (9) acting on an armature (12) with 

stop seats (30) for receiving chordal projections (10) provided on a 
rod or pushbutton (6), said rod or pushbutton (6) carrying 

a movable contact (4) for the connection of a fixed input 
(2) and an output (3) contacts, said movable contact (4) being 

movable between a closing and an opening position of said 
fixed contacts, said projections (10) assuming two 

different levels within said seats (30) according to 
whether the movable contact (4) is in said closed or open 

position; characterized in that the armature (12) is 
pivotally connected to a support (13) connected to the 

electromagnet (9) in the form of a single piece of 
ferromagnetic material and comprises two mutually parallel 

flanges (27) provided with said seats (30) and positioned 
on opposite sides of the rod or pushbutton (6), so that under 

action of the electromagnet the armature is pivoted and the contact 
is moved between said closing and opening positions. 
A device as claimed in claim 1, characterized in that 
a tension spring (20) acts on the armature (12) in 

correspondence with at least one of its two flanges (27). 
A device as claimed in claim 1 characterized in hat 
the armature (12) further comprises a part (15) provided  

 
with a profiled aperture (30A) for engagement by the 

movable core (9A) of the electromagnet (9), said part (15) 
being connected to the two substantially flat mutually 

parallel flanges (27).
