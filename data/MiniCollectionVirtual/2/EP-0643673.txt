<DESCRIPTION>
The invention is directed to the removal of cyanide 
from waste water using an adsorbent substrate treated 
with a water-insoluble compound. The present invention provides a method of removing 
cyanides from a cyanide-containing waste water 
comprising the steps of: 
(a) passing the cyanide-containing waste water into 
a reaction zone containing a porous solid substrate 
having a water-insoluble metal compound deposited 
thereon; (b) contacting the waste water with the substrate 
which adsorbs the cyanide from the waste water; and (c) discharging the waste water substantially free 
of the cyanide from the reaction zone. The present invention further provides a method of 
removing cyanide from a cyanide-containing waste water 
comprising the steps of: 
(a) passing the cyanide-containing waste water 
through a reaction zone containing a porous solid 
substrate having a water-insoluble metal compound 
deposited thereon, whereby the cyanide is removed from 
the water by adsorption onto the substrate; (b) supplying a source of oxygen to the reaction 
zone; (c) catalytically oxidizing the adsorbed cyanide; 
and (d) discharging the treated water substantially 
cyanide free from the reaction zone. Although cyanides themselves are useful industrial 
materials, as a component of waste water certain forms 
of cyanide are undesirable, having been found to be 
offensive to the aquatic environment. Examples of the 
undesirable forms of cyanides are HCN and CN-. As an 
environmentally protective measure, the Environmental 
Protection Agency (EPA) has placed strict limits on the 
allowable cyanide levels of industrial waste water  
 
effluent streams. Industrial sources of undesirable 
forms of cyanide are waste waters from the coal, the 
natural gas and the electroplating industries. Refinery 
waste waters, mainly from the FCC and coking processes, 
also require treatment to remove cyanides. Various approaches to removing cyanides have been 
described. A process which utilizes hydrogen peroxide 
for the destruction of cyanide in waste water has been 
found to meet the cyanide effluent limits. However, the 
process requires continuous addition of hydrogen 
peroxide which is costly. Additionally, storage and 
handling of the hydrogen peroxide requires extensive 
procedures and equipment. Hydrogen peroxide decomposes 
readily and special care must be taken to avoid 
contamination of the storage vessel which could 
catalytically accelerate decomposition. Furthermore, 
because decomposition releases oxygen, which is 
explos
