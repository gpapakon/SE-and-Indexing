<ABSTRACT>
This invention is a process for the use of a combination of ionizing radiation in conjunction with certain benzoporphyrin derivative compounds (BPD), preferably the compound benzoporphyrin derivative - monoacid ring-A (BPD-MA), to mediate the destruction of diseased or unwanted cells or tissues. Specifically, the invention is a method in which the sensitizer compounds are administered either systemically or locally to the diseased or unwanted tissue and irradiated with ionizing radiation (such as might be produced by a 60Co or x-ray source). The treatment with benzoporphyrin derivative compounds appears to sensitize the target cells or tissues in that those cells do not readily recover from irradiation exposure. In addition, the process may be used to lower the effective amount of radiation applied to a particular tissue target.

 METHOD FOR DESTROYING OR INHIBITING GROWTH OF UNWANTED CELLS OR TISSUESField of the Invention This invention is a process for the use of a combination of ionizing radiation in conjunction with certain benzoporphyrin derivative compounds (BPD) , preferably the compound benzoporphyrin derivative - monoacid ring-A (BPD-MA) , to mediate the destruction of diseased or unwanted cells or tissues. Specifically, the invention is a method in which the sensitizer compounds are administered to the diseased or unwanted tissue and irradiated with ionizing radiation (such as might be produced by a °°Co or x-ray source) . The treatment with benzoporphyrin derivative compounds appears to sensitize the target cells or tissues in that those cells do not readily recover from irradiation exposure. In addition, the process may be used to lower the effective amount of radiation applied to a particular tissue target.Background of the Invention The use of various porphyrin compounds in combination with irradiation -- be the radiation visible or ionizing -- in the treatment of diseased tissues is known. These treatments are often tumor-selective in that many porphyrin compounds accumulate at higher concentrations in tumor tissue than in normal tissue. Porphyrin derivatives have been used in the treatment of tumors using the process of photodynamic therapy (PDT) . In general, the PDT procedure involves administration of a sensitizer compound, such as the porphyrin derivatives, to target tissue and the subsequent treatment using light to that tissue. The PDT procedures function selectively to eradicate diseased tissue in the immediate area of the light source by generating singlet oxygen and activated molecules which damage tissue in that immediate area. Selectivity isSUBSTITUTESHEET
