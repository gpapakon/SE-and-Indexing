<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a process for degrading polymeric pollutants in water, in particular binders for surface coatings dissolved or dispersed in water. As is known, in contrast to low-molecular substances, the degradation of polymeric substances in water frequently poses problems. According to the invention the degradation of polymeric substances in water proceeds with addition of compounds forming hydroxyl radicals, in particular hydrogen peroxide, with UV irradiation. According to the invention the ratio of the unirradiated reactor volume to irradiated reactor volume is greater than 2, preferably greater than 5. The specific volume is between 4 and 1000 l per kW of electrical power of the UV source/sources.
