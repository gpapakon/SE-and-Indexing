<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to boric oxide and, more
particularly, to an amorphous boric oxide product and to a
process for producing said product.Boric oxide has many industrial applications,
especially in the glass-making field where it is desirable
to have a source of B2O3 without the undesirable presence of
sodium, such as is contributed by borax, or excess water to
evaporate, such as from boric acid.Boric oxide is generally produced on an industrial
scale by the dehydration of boric acid at high temperatures
such as in the range of about 700°-950°C in a glass furnace
fired by oil or gas. The boric oxide in the form of a
molten glass is solidified by allowing a continuous ribbon
thereof to flow over chill-rolls and then crushed and
screened to the desired particle size (see Kirk-Othmer,
"Encyclopedia of Chemical Technology" Fourth Edition, Volume
4, page 370, and US-A-2,893,838). The product is a high
purity (99wt% B2O3) amorphous solid, but it has the
disadvantage of being hygroscopic, tending to rehydrate and
cake under normal use and storage conditions. Furthermore,
it is expensive to manufacture due to the energy required to
maintain the furnace at the required high temperatures.A lower B2O3 content product has been manufactured
by reacting borax with sulfuric acid and then feeding the
resultant mixture to a gas-fired furnace operating at 800°-900°C.
The resultant amorphous product has a 95-98wt% B2O3
content but also contains residual sodium, which is
undesirable in many glass-making applications.The process also has high energy requirements which
make the product expensive to produce (see the supplement to
Mellor's Comprehensive Treatise on Inorganic and Theoretical
Chemistry, Volume V, Part A, pages 171-174).High-purity, crystalline boric oxide has also been
produced, such as by the slow dehydration of boric acid in
an oven at 225°-250°C over a period of from 7 to 14 days.
The use of sub-atmospheric pressures or organic liquid
carriers has also been suggested (see US-A-2,137,058,
US-A-2,186,257, US-A-3,397,954, US-A-3,582,272, 
US-A-4,908,196, IT-B-467,440 [Chemical Abstracts 47:4563(1953)], as well as the Kirk-Othmer
and Mellor references discussed above, and Kemp, "The Chemistry of
Borates", Part 1, pages 10-11 (1956).GB 2,192,625, which corresponds to US 4,908,196 describes the preparation of boric
oxide with 99% purity and a yield of 93% by a two-stage dehydration of boric acid
by first increasing temperature to 150°C, at below amtospheric pressure to form
metaboric acid, followed by gradually
