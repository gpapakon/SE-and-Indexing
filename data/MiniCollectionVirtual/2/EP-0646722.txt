<ABSTRACT>
A fuel pump (22) is mounted within the fuel tank (10) 
of an automobile on a bracket (20) attached to a flange 

(18) which sealingly covers an opening (28) in the fuel 
tank (10). The bracket (20) has side members (30) with 

materially altered sections (33) for increasing the energy 
absorption capability of the bracket. Materially altered 

sections (33) can take the shape of oblong slots (34) or 
circular apertures (84) in a centre section of the side 

members (82), or notches (94) along the edges of the side 
members (92). Crimped sections (104, 106) in the side 

members (102) also serve to absorb energy imparted to the 
bracket.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to automotive fuel pump, and,
more particularly, to an energy absorbing bracket assembly
for mounting an automotive fuel pump within a fuel tank.It is well known to mount a fuel pump within an
automobile fuel tank. Typically for in-tank mounted fuel
pumps, the fuel tank has an opening for access to the fuel
pump. A flange plate covers the opening and has fittings
for the fuel line, the fuel return line, and electrical
connections leading to the fuel pump. The fuel pump is
supported within the fuel tank by a bracket or other rigid
member attached to the flange plate. For example, U.S.
Patent 5,165,867 (Dockery) discloses such a mounting for an
electric fuel pump on a rigid metal return fuel conduit
including a plastic support with a centre body and a pair of
integral flexible arms for clamping the fuel pump to the
centre body. The rigid metal return fuel conduit may not,
however, adequately absorb energy imparted to it from a load
originating from the bottom of the fuel tank. As a result,
the energy from a bottom load may be transferred to the
flange plate perhaps causing it to become misaligned with
the top of the fuel tank.The present invention provides a fuel pump mounting
apparatus for more adequately absorbing energy and for
mounting a fuel pump within a fuel tank of an automobile
having a top and a bottom. A flange sealably covers an
opening in the top of the fuel tank with a bracket fixably
attached to the flange and to the fuel pump. The bracket
has at least one side with a plurality of structurally
altered sections positioned on the at least one side such
that the bracket absorbs energy from a load, which may
originate from the bottom of the tank, to prevent the energy
from transferring to the flange so that the flange remains
co-planar with the top of the tank. In a first preferred embodiment, the structurally
altered sections comprise oblong slots in the at least one
side with elongated ends aligned parallel to a vertical axis
between the top and bottom of the fuel tank.Other preferred embodiments have a bracket with at
least one side member having a pair of edges parallel to a
vertical axis between the top and the bottom of the fuel
tank. In a second preferred embodiment, the structurally
altered sections comprise at least one circular aperture in
each of the side members. In a third preferred embodiment,
the edges of the side members have at least one notch,
preferably a semi-circular shaped notch. In a fourth
preferred embodiment, the structurally altered sections
comp

<CLAIMS>
A fuel pump mounting apparatus for mounting a fuel pump
(22) within a fuel tank (10) of an automobile having a top

and a bottom, the apparatus comprising:

   a flange (18) sealably covering an opening (28) in the
top of the fuel tank (10);

   characterised in that said fuel pump (22) is fixedly
attached to said flange (18) by means of a bracket (20)

having at least one structural side member (30), at least
one structurally altered section (33) being positioned on

said at least one side member (30) so that the yield strength of the bracket is such that said bracket
will be deformed to absorb energy from a load originating

from the bottom of the tank (10) toward the top of the tank
(10) to prevent said energy from transferring to said flange

(18) so that said flange (18) remains co-planar with the top
of the tank (10).
A fuel pump mounting apparatus according to claim 1,
wherein said at least one section (33) comprises an oblong

slot (34) with elongated ends aligned parallel to a vertical
axis between said top and said bottom.
A fuel pump mounting apparatus according to claim 1,
wherein said at least one side member (30) has a pair of

edges parallel to a vertical axis between said top and said
bottom.
A fuel pump mounting apparatus as claimed in claim 3,
wherein said at least one section (33) comprises at least

one circular aperture (84) in said at least one side member
(30).
A fuel pump mounting apparatus according to claim 3,
wherein said at least one section (33) comprises at least

one notch (94) in each of said edges of said at least one
side member (30). 
A fuel pump mounting apparatus according to claim 5,
wherein said at lea
st one notch (94) has a semi-circular
shape.
A fuel pump mounting apparatus according to claim 1,
wherein said at least one section comprises at least one

crimped section (104) in said at least one side member (30),
said at least one crimped section (104) having a first bend

(104a) which angles from a plane along an axis extending
from said tank top to said tank bottom, and a second bend

(104b) which angles in an opposite direction to connect with
said at least one side.
A fuel pump mounting apparatus according to claim 7,
wherein a plurality of oppositely angled bends are

interposed between said first bend (104a) and said second
bend (104b).
A fuel pump mounting apparatus according to any one of
the preceding claims, including a pair of said side members

(30) with a plurality of structurally altered sections (33)
positioned on said side members such that said bracket (20)

absorbs energy from said load.
