<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a surface latent image
type silver halide photographic material. In more detail,
the invention relates to a surface latent image type
silver halide photographic material of hard gradation,
which shows a characteristic curve having a steep rise at
its toe.A silver halide photographic material requires high
sensitivity, fine graininess and low fog as basic capabilities.
A means of satisfying the requirements is a metal
doping technique. The metal doping technique is conducted
to improve the characteristics of silver halide grains and
to increase the efficiency of changing a photoelectron into
a developable latent image (quantum sensitivity). In more
detail, a metal ion or a metal complex containing a ligand
is incorporated into silver halide grains according to the
metal doping technique. In other words, the grains are
doped with the metal ion or the metal complex. According
to the metal doping, the characteristics of silver halide
grains can be improved to obtain a required capability of
an emulsion.A general and practical surface latent image type silver
halide photographic emulsion further requires hard gradation.
Particularly, a light-sensitive material for
graphic arts should have hard gradation even though the
sensitivity is degraded. The hard gradation means that a
characteristic curve of an emulsion (abscissa: exposure, 
ordinate: optical density) has a steep slope at a gradation
portion (straight line portion). A steep rise at the toe
(an exposure portion having an optical density lower than
the density of the gradation portion) of the characteristic
curve is also important about the gradation. A conventional
silver halide photographic material such as a color
paper also requires the hard gradation, namely the steep
rise at the toe of the characteristic curve to obtain a
clean and clear image.Research Disclosure 17643, item IA describes metal
ions or metal complexes, which can be incorporated into
silver halide grains according to the metal doping technique.At an initial stage of the metal doping technique,
metal complexes of platinum, palladium, iridium, rhodium
and ruthenium have been frequently used. These water-soluble
complexes are described in U.S. Patent No. 2,448,060.
The metal complexes function as an antifogging agent or a
stabilizer after silver halide grains are doped with the
complexes. Hexa-coordinated cyano-complex of palladium(IV)
further has a sensitizing effect. The complexes disclosed
in the Patent have a halide compound (such as chloride or
brom
