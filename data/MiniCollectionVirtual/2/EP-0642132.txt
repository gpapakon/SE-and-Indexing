<ABSTRACT>
In a memory unit having a sense amplifier for reading 
data, the dependence of the memory cell current detection level 

of the sense amplifier on the power source voltage is 
restrained. 
A memory-unit sense amplifier includes a bias circuit 
(20, 21, 22) for generating an output which mitigates 

fluctuations in the power source voltage VDD; and a detection 
result output section (10, 15) which outputs a memory cell 

current detection result obtained for the purpose of obtaining 
the value of memory cell data and which has a Pch (P-channel 

transistor), to the gate of which the output of the bias circuit 
(20, 21, 22) is connected, whereby fluctuations in the 

source/gate voltage of the Pch 10 are mitigated so as to 
restrain the dependence of the memory cell current detection 

level on the power source voltage.
