<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a chaos feedback system,
more particularly to a chaos feedback system which is able to
determine whether an input signal is obtained from a random
noise or from a meaningful information by analyzing
qualitative features of the strange attractor and feed the
analyzed result, back to a chaotic system so that the chaotic
system outputs a desired state.Recently, there have been active studies for seeking a
process for estimating the future movements of the nature
phenomena, such as the flow of water, air, and blood etc., the
movement may be predetermined by the mathematically expressed
regularity of the movements gained.Dynamics system can be defined as a system in which its
states are varying with respect to time.The dynamics system is called a stable system when the
steady state solution remains in one point, which is in turn
called an equilibrium point. When the attractor of the system
makes a closed loop, the system is called a periodic system. 
When the attractor has a shape of doughnut, it is called a
quasi-periodic system.The procedure for obtaining the attractor of the dynamics
system will be described as follows.Generally, an n-th order dynamics system have n state
equations, and the state equations indicate the variation
ratio of the states of the dynamics system depending on the
variation of time as expressed in equation (1).
dx1/dt = f(x1, x2, ..., xn),
...
dxn/dt = f(x1, x2, ..., xn)
   wherein, f: Rn → Rn represents a nonlinear mapping, and
x1, x2, ..., xn represent states respectively.Hereinafter, a pendulum motion will be described as an
elemental example of the dynamics system, the pendulum motion
is expressed by 2 state equations in that the pendulum motion
is a second order dynamics system as follows.
dx1/dt = f(x1, x2)dx2/dt = f(x1, x2)The solutions of the above state equations consist of a
transient solution and a steady state solution. The steady 
state solution can be expressed in a state space, in which
each state variable makes an axis of the state space, so as to
express the steady state solution entirely.Namely, the steady state solution at a given time t can
be expressed as a point in the state space. A set of the
points presented in the state space is called an attractor of
dynamics system.If the given dynamics system has a finite state, i.e., a
finite n-th order dynamics system, the system has a four forms
of the attractor. The dynamics systems are classified into
four types according to the types of attractor of the dynamics
system.Namely, the
