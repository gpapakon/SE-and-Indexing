<ABSTRACT>
An antibacterial vascular prosthesis obtained by 
winding a tube, fiber or sheet formed from a polymeric 

material and combined with an antibacterial substance on 
the outer surface of a vascular prosthesis composed of a 

tubular porous body formed of a synthetic resin is 
provided. The antibacterial vascular prosthesis can 

exhibit an antibacterial activity over a long period of 
time without impairing the porous structure, antithrombo-genicity 

and histocompatibility inherent in the vascular 
prosthesis composed of the tubular porous body formed of 

the synthetic resin. An antibacterial surgical suture 
comprising a tube or fiber formed from a polymeric 

material and combined with an antibacterial substance is 
also provided.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a vascular
prosthesis suitable for use as a substitute for an artery,
vein or the like and a surgical suture, and more
particularly to a vascular prosthesis and a surgical
suture, both, given with an antibacterial activity.Vascular prostheses composed of a tubular porous
body formed of a synthetic polymer such as polytetrafluoroethylene
(hereinafter abbreviated as "PTFE") or
polyester are widely used in repair of circulation or for
internal shunts upon dialysis. However, such vascular
prostheses involve a serious problem that they tend to be
infected with bacteria. More specifically, the bacteria
entered upon implantation of a vascular prosthesis, or the
like are easy to proliferate on an artificial material
such as the vascular prosthesis because an immune system,
which is an innate protective system in the living body,
is hard to normally and sufficiently operate in such
circumstances. In addition, tissue cells and 
intracellular substances damaged or destroyed by grafting,
or blood coagulation occurred in the damaged site provide
suitable proliferative sites for the entered bacteria.As methods for preventing the bacterial infection,
for example, it has been conducted to sterilize a vascular
prosthesis before its use, and to make a surgical field
thoroughly sterile. However, the infection rate is
considerably high as reported to be 1-5%. In order to
treat an infectious disease, it is conducted to administer
one or more antibiotics. By this method, however, it is
difficult to topically exert their antibacterial effect on
the site in which bacteria are grown. It has hence been
only necessary to excise or remove the vascular prosthesis
once it has become infected.As methods for protecting a vascular prosthesis from
bacterial infection, there have heretofore been proposed
various methods in which an antibacterial activity is
imparted to the vascular prosthesis itself. For example,
there have been proposed (1) a vascular prosthesis
obtained by applying or depositing a silver-antibiotic
complex on a porous structure formed of PTFE or polyester
[A. I. Benvenisty et al., J. Surgical Research, 44, 1-7
(1988)], and (2) a vascular prosthesis obtained by coating
a PTFE or polyester material with a surfactant and then
bonding an antibiotic to the surfactant by ionic bonding
[W. B. Shue et al., J. Vascular Surgery, 8, 600-605 
(1988)]. However, the amount of antibiotic is small and
therefore it does not last until peripheral tissues,
including the interior of the wall of the
