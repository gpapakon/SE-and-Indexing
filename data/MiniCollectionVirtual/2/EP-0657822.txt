<ABSTRACT>
The memory access limiting circuit detects when two 
or more of memory units (NVM1-3) associated with a 

microprocessor control system have been accessed enabled 
concurrently representing an error condition. The memory 

access limiting circuit is part of an integrated circuit 
(15). The integrated circuit also includes an address 

decoding (28) for receiving the unique address signal 
(A5) and causing a write enable signal to be generated 

for the memory units (NVM1-3) and one of a plurality of 
chip select signals to be generated for a respective one 

(NVM3) of the pins (P6-P8) of the memory units (NVM1-3). 
The monitoring circuit monitors the levels of the 

integrated circuit assigned for selecting the respective 
memory unit (NVM3). The monitoring circuit (438, 440, 

442, 444) generates a first output signal when a 
respective one of the memory unit chip select signals has 

been enabled and a second output signal when a plurality 
of chip select signals have been enabled. The second 

output signal is directed to the microprocessor (13) for 
corrective action.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a control system
having a two or more memory units and a circuit for
enabling access to the memory units for writing
information into selected ones of the memory units under
particular circumstances.European applications of even date are filed
concurrently herewith corresponding to the following U.S.

Patent Application Serial No. 08/163,629, entitled
CONTROL SYSTEM FOR AN ELECTRONIC POSTAGE METER HAVING A
PROGRAMMABLE APPLICATION SPECIFIC INTEGRATED CIRCUIT. 
A conventional postage metering system includes an
accounting system for recording the amount of funds and
other transaction information dispensed during the
metering process. These records are electronically
maintained in the non-volatile memory units which are
part of the accounting system. The accounting system is
conventionally comprised of a programmable microprocessor
in bus communication with an integrated circuit and
memory units. The integrated circuit includes an address
decoder which when properly addressed by the
microprocessor enables selecting one of the memories for
writing.It has been observed that under certain anomalous
conditions, an ambient error can occur within the
accounting system which causes the integrated circuit to
write enable more than one of the memories at a time.
The condition can corrupt the accounting information
recorded to the non-volatile
