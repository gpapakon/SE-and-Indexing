<ABSTRACT>
Extrusion apparatus and method includes a chamber of 
alterable volume having an outlet and a vent in a movable wall 

of the chamber to facilitate sealing the chamber upon 
application of force to the movable wall to displace viscous, 

fluid composition from within the chamber through the outlet 
and along a desired path. After displacement of a volume of 

the composition from the chamber, the vent is relieved to 

promote expansion of the composition within the chamber 
through the vent rather than through the outlet. The 

composition may be cured to substantially non-fluid condition 
along the desired path in response to applied thermal and/or 

ultraviolet radiant energy to provide traces of selected 
electrical properties on a work surface. The composition may 

be formulated, mixed and loaded into the chamber without 
compressible gas-filled pockets or voids in the volume of such 

composition that is confined within the chamber, thereby 
preserving direct correlation between the volume of the 

composition displaced from the chamber and the uniform width 
and thickness of an extruded trace.

<DESCRIPTION>
The subject matter of this application relates to the 
subject matter disclosed in U.S. Patents Nos. 5,099,090 and 
5,156,772. This invention relates to precision extrusion 
apparatus for extruding conductive traces on circuit boards, 
and more particularly to precision extrusion apparatus and 
method for reducing the effects of thermal expansion of the 
extrudable composition upon the quality and accuracy of 
conductive traces formed thereby. Electronic circuit boards for supporting and 
connecting electronic components are commonly produced using 
etching techniques that remove conductive material such as a 
continuous layer of copper foil adhered to an insulating layer 
in regions where connections are not desired, leaving traces 
of continuous conductive foil where desired between circuit 
nodes. Substantial amounts of the original conductive foil 
are commonly removed from the initial laminate of continuous 
conductive foil to produce the desired circuit traces in this 
manner. Recent developments in polymers that are heavily 
loaded with metallic silver particles facilitate the  
 
fabrication of circuit boards permitting extrusion of the 
desired circuit traces on an insulating layer directly in the 
desired circuit traces. Such polymers are conductive and may 
be extruded along paths that are determined according to 
computer-controlled movements of coordinated stages to 'write' 
the circuit traces between circuit nodes on an insulating 
layer. Polymers commonly used for this purpose typically rely 
upon multiple-solvent chemistry to provide quickly-setting 
conductive traces that can then be overcoated with insulative 
materials to promote additional extrusions of circuit traces 
that intersect, but do not connect to, the initially-extruded 
circuit traces. Complex circuit traces formed and initially 
set in this manner then require complete curing, for example, 
by baking at elevated temperatures in an oven, in order to 
fully cure the circuit traces in place on the insulating 
layer. One disadvantage of such systems is that the polymers 
expand as temperature increases, causing expansion of the 
volume of the viscous composition contained within an 
extruding vessel. Expansion of the composition within the 
extruding vessel commonly causes dribbling of the composition 
from an extruding tip which, when deposited on an insulating 
layer at the start of a conductive trace, can produce an 
unsightly, anomalous trace configuration that may undesirably 
overlap and connect to adjacent circuit
