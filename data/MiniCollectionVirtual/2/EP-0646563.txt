<ABSTRACT>
Mixtures of isomeric decyl alcohols are prepared by hydroformylation of mixtures containing but-1-ene and but-2-ene in two stages to give aldehyde mixtures, condensation of the aldehyde mixtures which are separated off and combined with formation of an aldol mixture and separation and hydrogenation of the aldol mixture. The first stage of the hydroformylation is carried out in the presence of rhodium catalysts dissolved in water, the second stage in the presence of cobalt catalysts homogeneously dissolved in the reaction medium. The mixture of isomeric decyl alcohols affords, esterified with phthalic acid, a mixture of isomeric decyl phthalates, which are used as plasticisers.

<CLAIMS>
A process for preparing mixtures of isomeric decyl alcohols, comprising the
hydroformylation of mixtures containing butene-1 and butene-2 in two

stages, the reaction in the first stage taking place in a heterogeneous
reaction system with the use of rhodium compounds containing water-soluble

phosphines in a complex bond as catalysts at temperatures of 70 to
150°C and at pressures of 0.4 to 30 MPa and in the second stage in a

homogeneous phase in the presence of cobalt compounds as catalysts at
temperatures of 130 to 180°C and at pressures of 8 to 30 MPa to form

aldehyde mixtures, separation and combination of the aldehyde mixtures
obtained from the hydroformylation stages condensation of the combined

aldehyde mixture with the formation of an aldol mixture and separation and
hydrogenation of the aldol mixture to form a mixture of isomeric decyl

alcohols.
The process for preparing mixtures of isomeric decyl alcohols according to
claim 1, characterised in that the reaction in the first hydroformylation stage

takes place at 100 to 130°C and at pressures of 1 to 10 MPa.
The process for preparing mixtures of isomeric decyl alcohols according to
claim 1 or 2, characterised in that the reaction in the first hydroformylation

stage takes place with a rhodium concentration of 20 to 1000 ppm by

into the second reaction stage.
