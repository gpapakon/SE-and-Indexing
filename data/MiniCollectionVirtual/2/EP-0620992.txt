<ABSTRACT>
An item of furniture is described, which can be composed of any desired number of basic elements. These basic elements are shelves and column elements which can be braced by tension members in the form of threaded rods. These threaded rods can be inserted in slots which are cut laterally into the column elements and extend up to the centre so that the axis of the threaded rods coincides with the axes of the column elements. The individual sections of the threaded rod, which extend in each case over a shelf, can be connected by threaded sleeves which bring about an extension of the tension members. These threaded sleeves are received by bores which widen the slot at the lower end of each column element. The column elements are expediently arranged on the bracing members in such a way that their slot points inwards. Between opposite column elements, transverse webs can be inserted by their ends in the slots. The rigid-corner bracing takes place by means of hexagon nuts which are screwed onto the end of the uppermost threaded rod.
