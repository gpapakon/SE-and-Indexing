<ABSTRACT>
An image displaying apparatus capable of 
displaying to an observer a more stereoscopic image 

with enhanced presence and realism. 
The apparatus has a display unit (1) which irradiates 
a beam and an optical system (2) which directs a light beam 

from said display to a pupil of an observer, a virtual 
image surface (5) formed by said optical system being a 

curved surface.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an image
displaying apparatus and, in particular, to an image
displaying apparatus, which projects a light beam
having information on an image generated by an image
generator onto the eyes of an observer through an
optical system and displays the image as a virtual
image for an observer.Conventionally, a large-screen image, which
produces presence is displayed by using a large CRT
display system, a projection TV or the like.These systems, however, have problems of
restricted conditions for use. For example, they
require larger space and the images are difficult to
see unless surrounding thereof is dark. For this
reason, there has recently been proposed an apparatus
designed to directly project a light beam from an image
displayed on an image display device onto the eyes of
an observer through an optical system disposed
extremely close to a person's face, thereby making the
observer visually recognize an equivalently larger
image as a virtual image.Fig. 1 illustrates a main portion of an image 
displaying apparatus proposed in JP-A-4-34512. An image is
displayed on a liquid crystal display 101 by data sent
through a signal line 116. The display 101 is
transmissively illuminated with a backlight light
source 104. Light which has passed through the display
101 provides a light beam including the information of
the displayed image.After the light beam passes through a magnifying
lens 151, it is reflected by a mirror 150 to become a
light beam 109 and thereafter it reaches a pupil 107 of
an observer. The observer visually recognizes the
displayed image by observing the light beam 109. The
power of the magnifying lens 151 is set so that an
image on the liquid crystal display 101 is displayed as
a virtual image at a predetermined distance, e.g., at a
point, which is 5 meters in front.In the foregoing conventional example, however, a
surface whereon the virtual image is displayed is a
plane; therefore, the displayed image seems flat for
the observer, failing to display to produce greater
presence. Moreover, when the image display of the
foregoing conventional example is applied for
displaying an image of a virtual reality system, the
image gives the observer an impression as if the image
were projected on a flat screen, failing to produce a
satisfactory presence. The EP-A-0 582 229, which is prior art under Art. 54(3)EPC,
discloses an image displaying apparatus for making both eyes of
an observer observe a virtual image. Image displaying units for
the left and right eye are
