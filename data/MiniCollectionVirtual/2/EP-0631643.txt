<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a sash window
unit, at least comprising a frame with a sash window which
is slidable vertically therein by means of two guideways
comprising a single track, which can interact with one or
more guide parts, sealing means between the sash window and
the frame, closing means for moving the sash window
relative to the frame at substantially right angles to the
plane of the sash window over a relatively small distance
for at least near a closed position of the sash window,
placing said sash window in sealing contact with the frame,
with the interposition of the sealing means, and on release
to make the sash window slidable without appreciable friction
and means for holding the sash window balanced in an
open positionSuch a sash window unit is known from EP-A-0 438
778. The sash window disclosed in said European application
comprises means on the sash window for moving the guide
parts relative to the sash window. Said means comprise a
handle coupled with angle bars, on which the guide parts
are mounted.The presence of movable guide parts on the sash
window itself has the disadvantage that with such a sash
window unit always relatively large side members of the
sash window are necessary to house the respective
components. This is especially considered to be a drawback
in case of large sash windows, which may sometimes have a
large area of up to 7 m2, as these windows will then become
excessively heavy, giving rise to extremely large forces
exerted on the guide parts and coupled components with
consequent increased wear.Sash window units have been in use for over a
century already for many buildings, such as houses, factory 
workshops etc. The invention is, of course, not limited to
such older sash windows, but can also be used in the case
of sash window units yet to be fitted. Sash windows have
the advantage that they do not involve swinging windows or
the like, and are thus not affected by wind. Moreover,
windows which swing outwards in houses directly beside the
street or a pavement are forbidden, and windows swinging
inwards require empty window sills. A relatively large area
of a window can be opened in a simple way in the case of
sash windows.The means for holding the sash window balanced in
an open position are often designed in the form of a
counterweight which is connected by a cord to the sash
window by means of a pulley, and which lies in a weight
shaft in or near the frame.Apart from the practical advantages, the appearance
of sash windows also gives them an

<CLAIMS>
Sash window unit, at least comprising a frame (1)
with a sash window (2) which is slidable vertically therein

by means of two guideways (5) comprising a single track,
which can interact with one or more guide parts (7),

sealing means (10) between the sash window (2) and the
frame (1), closing means for moving the sash window (2)

relative to the frame (1) at substantially right angles to
the plane of the sash window (2) over a relatively small

distance for at least near a closed position of the sash
window (2), placing said sash window (2) in sealing contact

with the frame (1), with the interposition of the sealing
means (10), and on release to make the sash window (2)

slidable without appreciable friction and means for holding
the sash window (2) balanced in an open position,
characterised in that
 the guide parts (7) are stationary,
and that the closing means comprise locally curved paths

(9) in the tracks, each guide part (7) being designed to
cooperate with a respective locally curved path (9), such

that upon closing of the sash window (2), said sash window
(2) is placed in sealing contact with the frame

automatically. 
Sash window unit according to claim 1,
characterised in that
 the guideways (5) have a stepped
cross-section, comprising two or more guiding levels (6a,

6b), and that each level of the guideways (5) comprises a
locally curved path (9a, 9b), and can interact with one or

more corresponding guide parts (7a, 7b), in which a guide
part (7a) which can interact with a deeper guiding level

(6a) has a smaller diameter and a greater length than an
adjacent guide part (7b) which can interact with a

shallower guiding level (6b), and that the guide part (7a)
with the smaller diameter can be moved past the locally

curved path (9b) of the shallower guiding level (6b) for
the adjacent guide part (7b).
Sash window unit according to claim 2,
characterised in that
 the closing means comprise the
guideways (5) or a part (21) thereof, with the

interposition of a suitable coupling, being movable by
means of one or more operating parts.
Sash window unit according to claim 3,
characterised in that
 the coupling is designed in the form
of a draw bar (15), which is provided locally with one or

more projections (17) which can interact with suitably
shaped recesses (18; 22) in the part (5; 21) to be moved,

and which draw bar (15) can be moved by means of one or

more operating handles.
Sash window unit according to claim 3 or 4,
charcterised in that
 the guideways (5) comprise at least
one switch (21) which can pivot about a hinge point (23)

and can be operated by the coupling to be moved between
three positions, a fixed open position, a position aligned

with the guideways (5), and a closed position.
