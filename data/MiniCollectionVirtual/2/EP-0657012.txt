<ABSTRACT>
A fossil fuel/air burner nozzle is provided with a wall (22) at its inlet, in which are apertures (24) which narrow in a direction radially outward of the nozzle. Each aperture is axially aligned with a respective bluff member (18) at the outlet so as to deliver thereto a fuel/air mix flow at a velocity which is graded in said radial direction so as to ensure flame retention on the bluff members (18).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention concerns burner nozzles of the 
kind which direct streams of mixed fossil fuel and air 
into a combustion chamber, where the mix is burned so as 
to heat water and generate steam for the purpose of power 
generation. Such nozzles may be of circular or rectangular cross 
sectional shape, and in both cases comprise co-axial, 
nested passages which are fed from a common fuel/air 
input conduit, plus a further, outer passage for a flow 
of air per se. US-A-4654001 discloses a circular fuel burner nozzle 
which comprises an outer tubular housing having a 
stabiliser located therein to define coaxial passages. 
Members are provided intermediate the housing and the 
stabilizer to mix the fuel passing through the passages. 
Discharge vanes are disposed in the end region of the 
nozzle between the stabilizer and the tubular housing to 
reduce the turbulence of the mixed fuel as it emerges 
from the nozzle. Although the fuel burner nozzle disclosed in 
US-A-4654001 reduces NOx formation it is desirable to 
create conditions wherein once the fuel/air mix is 
ignited, a flame attaches to the outlet plane of the 
nozzle and stays attached for the duration of the primary 
flow. In known arrangements, bluff members are provided 
about the outlet which enable the said attachment. If the flow of fuel/air varies, problems arise by 
way of the flame detaching from the nozzle outlet. 
Rectangular nozzles suffer less from this phenomenon than 
do circular nozzles. In the latter type, swirl vanes 
have been incorporated in the outer fuel/air subsidiary 
flow passages and have reduced but not obviated the 
tendency of the flame to detach. Such vanes cannot be 
used in rectangular nozzles. Consequently some 
detachment occurs in both types of burner nozzle. The present invention seeks to provide an improved  
 
fossil fuel/air burner nozzle. According to the present invention a fossil fuel/air 
burner nozzle comprises a primary nozzle having nested, 
coaxial passages connected to a common supply conduit for 
the receipt of a flow of mixed fossil fuel and air and 
wherein the outer one of the nested passages is provided 
at its inlet end with a wall which lies in a plane normal 
to its axis, characterised in that the said wall has 
apertures therein which are spaced about said axis in 
symmetrical manner, and within its outlet end said 
passage is provided with a peripheral equi angular array 
of bluff members each of which is axially aligned with a 
respective aperture. The cross sectional shape of a
