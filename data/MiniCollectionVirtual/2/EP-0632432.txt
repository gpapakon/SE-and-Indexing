<ABSTRACT>
The disclosure relates to a pivot bearing assembly 
(52) for a disc drive comprising in combination a 

bearing (52) surrounded on one side by a wishbone-shaped 
end (60) of the actuator arm (38), and on the other side 

by a biasing spring metal strip (70) whose ends are 
tightly attached to the split ends (62, 64) of the 

wishbone of the actuator arm. When the arm assembly is 
mounted in the disc drive, the bearing is mounted on its 

center of rotation, with the spring tensile force 
biasing the head of the actuator arm against the spindle 

(42) of the stepper motor (37). The distal end of the 
actuator arm with a gear sector (56) which meshes with a 

pinion (42a) on the motor shaft (42) of the stepper 
motor (37) so that rotation of the motor shaft causes 

movement of the actuator arm (38) and with it the 
flexure (36) and transducer (34), across the surface of 

the disc (30). The bearing (52) comprises a pair of 
compliant bearings (53, 54) which are pre-loaded inwards 

by a screw (57) essentially along the lines of force 
(55, 56) to create a very long effective axis.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention is directed generally to the field
of disc drives, and more particularly to an improved
pivot support for the actuator arm thereof.Disc drives record and reproduce information
stored on concentric circular tracks on magnetic discs.
The tracks are written and read by magnetic heads which
must be accurately positioned over a selected one of the
tracks on the surface of the disc. Various methods have
been used to position the heads and hold them precisely
located over the selected track. The two commonly-used
types of head positioning mechanisms are linear and
rotary head actuators. DE-A-2812981 and JP-A-59/36379
disclose examples of such head positioning arrangements.US 4,682,255 also discloses a rotary head actuator
which uses leaf springs to pre-load the bearings of
the actuator arm support structure.In the second, rotary type, to which this
invention is directed to, the head moves generally
radially in order to access the various disc tracks.
However, the movement is usually along a segment of a
circle. The commonly-known form of rotary actuator
includes a head/arm flexure for supporting the
transducer, the transducer or read/write head
extending out from a pivot to the track position to be
accessed. Extending from the pivot to essentially
form a V-shaped actuator arm assembly with the
head/arm is an actuator arm, which in turn is coupled
to a stepper motor. As the stepper motor rotates, the
actuator arm assembly rotates about the pivot point,
moving the transducer from track to track. Obviously, 
a highly stable pivot at the end of the actuator arm
distal from the stepper motor is absolutely required,
so that with the wear caused by time and repeated
usage, and the fluctuations caused by changes in
operating temperature, the present position of the
transducer relative to a target track and its long
term stability over that track is not easily altered.
The pivot mechanism must offer high precision,
reliability and low mechanical resistance. Further,
in the present price-conscious competition in the disc
drive market, the pivot mechanism must be easily
constructed and assembled.The pivot mechanisms in the prior art generally
include a shaft supporting the juncture of the two
arms, i.e. the actuator drive arm and the head arm,
two ball bearings, and the required spring retainers
pre-load springs and attachment means coupling the
separate elements to the arms.This invention provides a disc drive including a base casting
(4) and upright sidewalls (6, 8, 10, 12) defining a data storage

</DESCRIPTION>
<CLAIMS>
A disc drive including a base casting (4) and
upright sidewalls (6,8,10,12) defining a data storage

device housing (2), a rotatable disc (30) supported on
a spindle (31) for constant rotation and having data

stored in addressable locations on tracks thereon, an
actuator arm (32) supporting a transducer (34) for

accessing said locations on the disc (30) where data
can be stored, the arm (32) being supported at one end

by a pivot bearing mounting structure (40) at a pivot
point and about which the arm (32) may rotate;

said pivot bearing mounting
structure (40) comprises a pre-loaded compliant bearing

assembly (52) mounted to said base casting (4) to
support said actuator arm (32) at one end thereof;

characterised in that said pivot bearing mounting
structure (40) further comprises a raised shoulder region (60)

extending from said base casting (4) at a fixed
predetermined position, a shaft (120) attached at one

end to said shoulder region (60) and extending from
said shoulder region (60) and having a threaded bore

(121) extending axially into said shaft (120) from the
other end, a pair of compliant bearings (53,54)

coaxially mounted around said shaft (120),
a screw (57) having a surface disposed

against said bearing assembly (52) to provide an axial
bearing pre-load force, said screw

(57) having a threaded portion and a cap portion, said
threaded portion matingly engaging said threaded shaft

bore (121), said lower surface of said bearing assembly
(52) having a face for resting on said shoulder (60) so

that positional alignment of the bearing assembly (52) 
on said base casting (4) is accurately defined, said

shaft (120) and each said bearing (53,54) having axial
lengths chosen so that when said screw (57) is

tightened into said threaded bore (121) said cap
portion couples a force to one end of said pair of

compliant bearings (53,54) to inwardly pre-load said
bearings (53,54), whereby possible misalignment of an

end of said actuator arm (32) distal from said pivot
point is accommodated and a long effective axis is

created.
