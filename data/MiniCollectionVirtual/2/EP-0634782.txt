<ABSTRACT>
A heater and pedestal actuator (50) is provided to actuate the pedestal (34) of 
a deposition chamber (10) from a first position (12) wherein a wafer (30) may be 

placed thereon to a second position (14) adjacent to the deposition target (16). To 
adjust the inward travel of the heater (32) to compensate for target (16) erosion, the 

actuator (50) includes a worm drive apparatus (76) driven by a stepper motor (66). 
The worm drive (76) is pitched, and the stepper motor (66) is selected, to allow fine 

movement of the heater (32) on the order of less than .01 mm for each arcuate step 
of the stepper motor (66). A computer (400) is used to actuate the stepper motor (66), 

and cause additional stepper motor actuation, to increase the travel of the heater (32) 
toward the target (16) to compensate for target (16) erosion. Additionally, the 

computer (400) may vary the speed of the worm drive (76) rotation, to create different 
heater (32) travel speeds within the chamber (10).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to the processing of integrated circuit wafers and 
equipment useful for such processing. More particularly, the present invention relates to 
a method and apparatus for adjustment of spacing between wafer and PVD target during 
semiconductor processing. To sputter coat a deposition layer onto a substrate such as a wafer in a sputter 
chamber, a robot arm places a wafer onto a receiver which is located in the chamber to 
position the wafer over a resistance-heated support member commonly referred to as a 
"heater". The heater moves through the receiver to position the wafer thereon (the first or 
lower position), and then moves upwardly into a second, upper position in close, preselected 
proximity with the target for deposition of the coating on the wafer. As the wafer  
 
is moved from the first position to the second position, it passes through a hanger on which 
a cover ring is suspended, and the wafer engages the ring and lifts the ring off the hanger. To ensure proper coating characteristics, the top of the wafer should be located 
approximately 30 to 80 mm from the face of the target, and the edge of the wafer is masked 
by the ring to prevent passage of the reactive plasma in the chamber to the underside of the 
wafer. The actual target-to-wafer distance is selected to establish the required coating 
thickness and properties, and this established distance must be maintained with minimal 
deviation as each subsequent wafer is processed with the same target. However, as wafers 
are sequentially coated using the same target, the surface of the target is eroded, thereby 
causing the target to become physically smaller. Thus, the target-to-wafer distance increases 
unless the heater is moved further upward to compensate for target erosion. To move the heater from the lower position at which it receives the wafer to the 
upper position at which the wafer is processed, a pedestal is connected to the underside of 
the heater and has a shaft extending out the bottom of the chamber where it is driven by 
a positioning device. A physical stop is provided in the positioning device to engage a finger 
on the pedestal to limit upward movement of the pedestal shaft into the chamber. By 
adjusting the location of this physical stop, the amount of travel of the pedestal from the 
first position to the second position before the physical stop engages the finger may be 
varied, and thus the travel of the heater inwardly of the chamber can be controlled. As the 
target erodes and the
