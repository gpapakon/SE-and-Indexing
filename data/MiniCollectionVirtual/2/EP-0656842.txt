<ABSTRACT>
An apparatus and method for making a low cost, self-venting, inflatable protective cushion of simple and structurally efficient design with a shape and construction that optimizes the cushion's ability to withstand inflation pressures and impact when deployed which includes a sheet (20) of material woven of less than 420 denier yarn defined by at least one fold line (22) and a plurality of flap portions (23), each flap portion having a base edge (24) corresponding to a fold line (22) and at least two side edges (25) each extending outwardly from the base edge (24) and ultimately converging to meet each other, the flap portions (23) being folded at the fold lines (22) and being joined at corresponding side edges (25) to define an inflatable chamber. The inflatable protective cushion and method for making same may further include a lightweight, low permeability, fabric that optimizes the cushion's ability to whithstand inflation pressures and impact when deployed and minimizes the packed volume of the cushion when stored.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to inflatable
protective cushions, and a method of making these cushions of the type
as defined in the preambles of claims 1 and 12,
useful for protecting passengers
in automotive vehicles. The present invention would also
be useful for many types of transportation vehicles, as
well as machinery, as a protective device that can be
stored compactly.Inflatable protective cushions
of the above type (FR-A-2185251)
used in passenger
vehicles are a component of relatively complex systems.
The main elements of these systems are: an impact sensing
system, an ignition system, a solid propellant material,
an attachment device, a system enclosure, and an
inflatable protective cushion. Upon sensing an impact,
the propellant is ignited causing an explosive release of
gases filling the cushion to a deployed state which can
absorb the impact of the forward movement of a body and
dissipate its energy by means of rapid venting of the gas.
The entire sequence of events occurs within about 30
milliseconds. The maximum pressure occurring in the
cushion in the inflation event is about 2,7 x 104 Pa (4 psi) and
increases to about 4,8 x 104 to about
5,5 x 104 Pa (7-8 psi)
when impacted by a person. In
the un-deployed state, the cushion is stored in or near
the steering column, the dashboard, in a door, or in the
back of a front seat placing the cushion in close
proximity to the person it is to protect.To provide efficient storage and adequate protection,
it is advantageous to have an inflatable protective
cushion that has a small volume when not deployed
permitting compact storage, low permeability permitting
fast inflation, and strength for withstanding inflation
pressure and absorbing the impact of a person or an
object. Many of the traditional driver's side inflatable
cushions are of a circular shape constructed with two
circular pieces made from a coated fabric made with 467 to 933 dtex
(420-840 denier) nylon yarn as shown in Fig. 1. This
product has several deficiencies. First, the design shape
may result in a circumferential seam creating preferential
locations for failure where the seam is perpendicular to
the bias directions of the yarn. Second, that cushion
inherently has wrinkles that result in high and low stress
areas enhancing the probability of the cushion failing to
withstand inflation pressure and impact when deployed.
Third, the 467 to 933 dtex (420-840 denier) fabric and coating on the fabric
results in a heavier and bulkier cushion that is not
compact when stored. Fourth, the

(23) having a base edge (24) corresponding to a fold line (22) and
at least two side edges (25) each extending outwardly from the

base edge (24) and being joined at corresponding side edges (25)
