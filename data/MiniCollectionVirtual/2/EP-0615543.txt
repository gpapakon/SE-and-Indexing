<ABSTRACT>
The present invention provides for dilute aqueous hypohalite solutions stabilized against decomposition catalyzed by copper ions present in said solution containing a small amount of a multidentate heteroaromatic stabilizer compound including general structure selected from: (1), (2), (3), wherein Ar is comprised of carbon or carbon and nitrogen atoms sufficient to form a 5- or 6-membered aromatic ring or at least one other ring condensed with said 5- or 6-membered aromatic ring, X is selected from the group consisting of nitrogen or carbon which form part of an aromatic ring structure and oxygen, and Y is nitrogen or carbon which form part of an aromatic ring structure. This invention also provides stable hypohalite-containing aqueous bleach, detergent and disinfectant formulations which retain hypohalite stability even after further dilution with copper-contamined water.

<DESCRIPTION>
 STABILIZED HYPOHALITE COMPOSITIONSBACKGROUND OF THE INVENTIONField of the InventionThis invention relates to aqueous bleach, cleansing or disinfectant compositions of enhanced stability containing a hypohalite, e.g., sodium hypochlorite, and an effective amount of an N-containing heteroaromatic compound which is stable in the presence of said hypohalite and which is capable of forming ultidentate complexes with copper ions present in said composition.Description of Related ArtAlkali or alkaline earth metal hypohalites, most notably sodium hypochlorite, are among the strongest classes of bleaching agents known. Sodium hypochlorite is generally formulated with water at a concentration of less than about 15% by weight for use as a household bleach for laundering or for pulp and textile bleaching. It is also used as a cleansing adjunct in liquid cleaning compositions, e.g., dishwashing liquids, or as a germicide in disinfectant solutions, generally at concentrations of less than about 5% by weight.One of the major problems associated with the use of these materials is the relative instability of aqueous hypohalite solutions. It is known that aqueous hypochlorite (OCl") will decompose to chlorate (C103') when subjected to higher temperatures, e.g., above 40°C, or after prolonged exposure to light. It is also known that the presence of heavy metal ions, e.g., copper, nickel and/or cobalt, in aqueous hypochlorite solutions will catalyze hypochlorite decomposition to oxygen gas and chloride ions. To maintain efficacy, manufacturers of products containing hypochlorite take steps to remove as much as possible of the heavy metal 

 contaminants from the formulations and to provide appropriate packaging materials, storage and use instructions.However, there are many uses of aqueous hypochlorite where the presence of or introduction of heavy metal decomposition catalysts is beyond the manufacturer's control. Such is the case with respect to concentrated aqueous hypochlorite bleach which is formulated to be diluted by the consumer with water prior to household or industrial use. Storage of unused diluted product can gradually lead to decreased bleaching efficacy and a build up of oxygen pressure in sealed containers as a consequence of the decomposition catalysed by heavy metal contaminants introduced with the dilution water. In addition, detergent and disinfectant compositions containing hypochlorite can be contaminated with heavy metals by contact with metal surfaces during manufacture or as a consequence of the
