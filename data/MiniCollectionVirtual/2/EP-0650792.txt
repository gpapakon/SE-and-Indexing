<ABSTRACT>
A cutting insert (10) or (10') for boring machines is 
constituted by a substantially prismatic body, with two cutting 

sides, whose front surface is centrally provided with a slightly 
concave portion (12) or (12'), which extends for the whole 

longitudinal development.
 

The insert (10) or (10') is locked in a traditional hollow space 
(16) obtained on the head (18) of a boring machine, by means of 

one or more screws (20) whose lower sector, substantially 
truncated-conic, shows a slight convexity, perfectly 

complementary to the concave configuration of the central portion 
(12) or (12') of said insert.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to
a boring tool according to the preamble of claim 1 and as known
from DE-A-4 203 544.It is known that to carry out some mechanical precision workings
on through or dead holes and cylindrical or conic hollow spaces,
special tools are utilized having single or multiple cutting
edges, by means of which one rebores the holes already obtained
in the part; the little quantity of material or machining
allowance which is removed allows to standardize and bring to the
wished diameter, with very strict tolerances, the internal
surface of the hole or hollow space. Said tools, called borers,
are traditionally constituted by a stem carrying at one end a
stem wherein the cutting body is housed and restrained in a
special groove or hollow space; the opposing end of the stem is
generally conified to engage in the spindle of the borer or of
other machine tools, such as, for instance, millers and lathes.Concerning the locking of the insert on the head of the borer,
several systems are known depending on which said insert are
realized according to different configurations.The basic requirement is that of ensuring that, during the
operating stage, said cutting inserts, priorly adjusted
relatively to the exposure and adjustment of the cutting edge, do
not come out of their seat.In Italian patent nr. 1163403, filed on 26.5.83, the same applicant
had proposed an advantageous solution for the aforementioned 
problems; according to the invention of said patent, in the tool
for the precision mechanical working in question, the fastening
of the insert or blade is obtained through one or two screws,
whose head has a truncated-conic portion suitable to get directly
in touch with said insert, to tighten it in the corresponding
hollow space obtained on the head of the borer.The same patent provides, as means for the precision adjustment
of the insert, other screws which, through pins with inclined
plane heads, work on the back of said insert; the latter,
according to the aforementioned locking and adjustment system,
has a substantially trapezoid section, whose front surface,
matched by the locking screws, is wholly flat.This structural arrangement has proved advantageous, as it allows
in the first place to realize an efficacious locking of the blade
with no need for complicated technologies to obtain it; besides,
such a borer is ecomomically realizable, as it does not require
the adoption of complex elements for locking the insert,
constituted, for instance, by suitably shaped jaws such as are
found, for

<CLAIMS>
A boring tool comprising a tool holder and a cutting insert (10, 10'),
wherein the cutting insert is made of hard metal, has two cutting sides

and a front surface having a concave configuration and is constituted
by a substantially prismatic body (10, 10'), said borer has a head (18),

said head being provided with an insert seat (16) and said cutting insert (10, 10') is housed in
said insert seat (16) and is restrained in it by at least one screw (20)

matching said front surface, characterized
in that said insert seat (16) is constituted by a hollow space and

in that the insert (10, 10')
has the front surface developing longitudinally on differentiated levels

comprising a slight concavity, along a longitudinally extended central
portion (12, 12'), and two opposing side portions (14, 14') adjoining

said concavity, each of said side portions (14, 14') having a height
lower than that of the concavity of said central portion (12, 12'); and in

that the screw (20) has a head (22) and a lower part (24, 26), said
lower part (24, 26) having a convex configuration;

the concavity of the insert (10, 10') being completely complementary to
said convex configuration of said lower part (26) of said screw (20).
The boring tool according to claim 1, wherein the concavity of the
central portion (12, 12') has an arc of circle, said circle having a radius

comprised between 3 and 10 mm.
The boring tool according to claim 1 or 2, wherein the side portions
(14, 14') have a height approximetely equal to one-half the concavity

of said central portion (12, 12'). 
The boring tool according to anyone of the preceding claims, wherein the cutting insert
(10, 10') has a longitudinal axis and the side

portions (14) develop along planes slightly inclined towards said
longitudinal axis of the insert (10, 10').
The boring tool according to anyone of the preceding claims from 1
to 3, wherein the side portions (14') develop along horizontal planes.
The boring tool according to anyone of the preceding claims,
wherein a surface of the cutting insert (10, 10'), opposite to the front

surface, is flat and complementary to the matching surface of the
hollow space (16).
