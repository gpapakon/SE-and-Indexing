<ABSTRACT>
In the case of liquid crystal polymers, on the one hand the rigid molecule chains and on the other hand possibly present fibrous reinforcing materials are aligned largely parallel to a weld line or flow line, with the result that the physical properties are lacking in the region of the weld line or flow line. It is an object of the invention to provide a possible way of preventing weld lines or flow lines from occurring in the first place. For this purpose, the liquidified material is subjected to a shearing energy from its entry into the injection mould, over at least part of the length of the workpiece. This shearing energy is produced by relative movement between two surfaces of the mould parts.

<CLAIMS>
Process for the processing of thermoplastic
polymers by means of the injection-moulding technique to

avoid or at least reduce a flow line in the production of
hollow-cylindrical workpieces having an obstacle which

generates the cavity and is to be surrounded by the
polymer, the liquefied material being subjected to a

shearing energy from entry into the cavity by rotating
the obstacle in the region of oncoming flow.
