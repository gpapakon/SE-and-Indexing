<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to anti-oxidant
containing polyolefin compositions including titanium
dioxide-coated mica particles with a coating of silica
and alumina calcined thereon to prevent yellowing of the
polyolefin compositions.Many pearlescent or nacreous pigments are based
on micaceous substrates which have been coated with a
metal oxide layer. As a result of reflection and
refraction of light, these pigments exhibit pearl-like
luster and depending on the thickness of the metal oxide
layer, they can also exhibit interference color effects.Among the pearlescent pigments encountered most
often on a commercial basis are titanium dioxide-coated
mica pearlescent pigments. However, often such pigments
are incompatible with the polyolefin compositions in
which they are incorporated. For instance, inorganic
pigments, such as titanium dioxide-coated mica pigments,
frequently cause yellowing of anti-oxidant containing
polyolefin compositions in which they are contained.U.S. Patent No. 4,209,430 relates to a process
for suppressing yellowing in thermoplastic polyolefins
containing a phenolic anti-oxidant and TiO2 pigment by 
adding a phosphorylated polyene either directly to the
polyolefin or as a coating on the pigment.U.S. Patent No. 4,357,170 reviews various
solutions to the problem of yellowing of titanium dioxide
pigments in polymeric compositions such as polyethylene
in the presence of additives such as phenolic
antioxidants.U.S. Patent No. 4,494,993 relates to a pigment
in which a homogeneous mixture of titanium dioxide,
silicon dioxide and aluminum oxide is coated on mica
flakes.W0-A-9401498 points out that the discoloration problem is
overcome only if the titanium dioxide coated mica is overcoated
with silicon oxide, the coated grains are further coated with
aluminum oxide and then the surfaces of the resultant coated
particles are still further coated with zinc oxide or hydrate.
EP-A-0560144 describes a pigment per sé.It has been found that the prior art solutions
to the yellowing of anti-oxidant containing polyolefin
compositions are not totally effective. Some yellowing
of the polyolefin compositions can still be seen.
Therefore, it is desirable to develop a titanium dioxide-coated
mica containing polyolefin composition which
avoids the disadvantages of the prior art described
above, affording the advantages of substantially
improving control of the yellowing phenomena frequently
encountered.It is accordingly an object of this invention
to provide anti-oxidant containing polyolefin
composition
