Device for modifying the natural pressure
distribution of a ski, such as especially an alpine ski, over

its gliding surface, the ski being provided to be used with
a boot, the device including a front base plate (25) and a

rear base plate (35) provided to be affixed to the ski in its
central zone, each of the base plates having a joining Piece

(33) raised with respect to the upper surface of the ski, a
long incompressible stiffening member (15, 55) which is

adapted to extend above the upper surface of the ski, the ends
of the stiffening member being supported against the joining

pieces of the base plates,

   characterized in that a central zone (17a, 58) of the
stiffening member is non-stable and deformable along a

vertical direction by buckling or folding of the levers,

   wherein a vertically movable pedal (12, 70) located at
the level of the central zone is provided to receive the sole

of the boot,

   wherein the pedal is movable between a lowered position
where it forces the central zone of the stiffening member to

flatten so as to generate, in the stiffening member, a
compression stress that is transmitted by reaction to the

joining pieces of the base plates, and a raised position where
it releases the central zone of the stiffening member so as to

eliminate said compression stress, and

   wherein a return spring (9, 69, 90) elastically returns
the pedal to its raised position.
Device according to claim 1, characterized in that
the central zone of the stiffening member(55) includes two 

levers (59, 60) journaled with respect to one another about a
horizontal and transverse axis (61) in the manner of a non-stable

toggle joint, wherein the free end of each lever (59,
60) is journaled to the remainder of the compression member

about a horizontal and transverse axis (62, 63).
Device according to claim 2, characterized in that
the movable pedal is a pallet (70) which extends one (60) of

the levers of the toggle joint.
Device according to claim 3, characterized in that
in the flattened position of the toggle joint, the two levers

(50, 60) are in support against one another along a
longitudinal direction.
Device according to claim 3, characterized in that
the journal axis (61) of the two levers is borne by the end of

a lever (59), and wherein it is movable at the adjacent end of
the other lever (60), where it is slidably mounted along a

slot (65) oriented along the longitudinal direction of the
lever, and wherein at least one spring (69) elastically

returns the axis (62) towards the end of the slot to return
the toggle joint towards its open position.
Device according to claim 3, characterized in that
one (59) of the two levers (59, 60) bears at least one braking

arm (80, 81).
Device according to claim 6, characterized by the
fact that one (59) of the levers is a housing which bears the

braking arms (80, 81) and which, in its rotational movement,
drives the arms between two positions, one working position 

where the arms project downwardly, and one resting position
where the arms ascend in the horizontal position.
Device according to claim 1, characterized by the
fact that the stiffening member is a continuous, flexible and

non-compressible stiffening blade (15), and wherein the
central zone of the stiffening member is a zone (17a) where

the blade deforms naturally by buckling.
Device according to claim 8, characterized in that
the pedal (12) is the pedal for activating a braking retention

device provided to be associated with a rear binding element
(3).
Device according to any of the preceding claims,
characterized in that an abutment (20, 36) adapted to be

affixed to the ski cooperates with a complimentary abutment
means (18, 68) of the stiffening blade to limit the

compression stress exerted by the stiffening member (15,55)
towards one of the base plates (25, 35).
Device according to claim 10, characterized in that
the abutment adapted to be affixed to the base is a limit stop

(20) that straddles the stiffening member (15), and wherein
the abutment means of the blade is a shoulder (18) which

provides the blade with a greater width than that of the
opening (21) of the limit stop.
Device according to claim 11, characterized in that
the limit stop is the plate (36) of the base plate (35)

associated with one of the binding means, and wherein the
abutment means is a shoulder zone (68) of a portion (57) of 

the stiffening member whose width is greater than that of the
opening (44) of the plate.
Device according to claim 1, characterized in that
longitudinal adjustment means (32, 42) are provided to adjust

the longitudinal position of the joining pieces (33) of the
base plates (25, 35) against which the ends of the stiffening

member are in support.
Ski brake, adapted to brake the displacement of a
ski in the absence of the boot, including at least one

braking arm (80, 81) adapted to be mounted on the ski, and
movable between a working position where the brake projects

beneath the lower surface of the ski, and a resting position
where the arm rises along the lateral edges of the ski,

including an activation toggle joint (58) movable between a
flattened position and a folded position to control the

displacement of the braking arm (80, 81), and a return spring
to elastically bias the toggle joint in its folded position

corresponding to the working position of the braking arm,
characterized in that the two ends of the toggle joint are

connected to the joining pieces of the two base plates (25,
35) of the brake, the base plates being distinct and adapted

to be directly and remotely assembled to the ski.
Ski brake according to claim 14, characterized in
that the activation toggle joint includes a set of two levers

(59, 60) journaled with respect to one another about a
longitudinal and transverse axis (61), and wherein one (59) of

the levers bears the braking arms (80, 81).
Ski brake according to claim 15, characterized in
that the levers (59, 60) have means (80c, 81c, 65) for 

bringing the braking arms (80, 81) closer to the longitudinal
axis of the base (1) when the braking arms are brought back to

their resting position by the boot.
Ski, especially a ski adapted for alpine skiing,
including a base (1) on which is mounted at least one binding

element (3, 4) adapted to retain a boot, characterized in that
it further has a device according to any of claims 1 to 13,

adapted to distribute the pressure that the base exerts on the
snow.
Ski, especially a ski intended for alpine skiing,
including a base (1) on which is mounted at least one binding

element (3, 4), adapted to retain a boot, characterized in
that it further has a ski brake according to any of claims 14

to 16, adapted to brake the ski in case the boot retained by
the binding elements is released.
