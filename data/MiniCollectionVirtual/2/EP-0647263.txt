<CLAIMS>
The use of isethionic acid as the acid base of acidic 
cleaning and/or disinfecting formulations. 
The use claimed in claim 1, characterized in that the 
cleaning and/or disinfecting formulation contains 0.5 to 

100% by weight of isethionic acid, based on the formulation 
as a whole. 
The use claimed in claim 1, characterized in that the 
cleaning and/or disinfecting formulation contains 5 to 95% 

by weight of isethionic acid, based on the formulation as 
a whole. 
The use claimed in claims 1 to 3, characterized in 
that the cleaning and/or disinfecting formulation contains 

other inorganic and/or organic acids besides isethionic 
acid. 
The use claimed in claim 4, characterized in that the 
cleaning and/or disinfecting formulat:ion contains 30 to 40% 

by weight of sulfuric acid and/or 20 to 30% by weight of 
phosphoric acid, based on the formulation as a whole. 
The use of cleaning and/or disinfecting formulations 
as claimed in claims 1 to 5 in the food-processing industry. 
The use claimed in claim 6 for removing carbohydrates, 
protein, fats, inorganic mineral constituents and other 

residues, more particularly from hard surfaces.
