<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates broadly to the field of recombinant vaccines. The
vaccines are directed to preventing Group A streptococcal infections, which may otherwise result in
rheumatic fever.Acute rheumatic fever (ARF) is the major cause of heart disease in children around
the world. The disease is rampant in developing countries where prevalence rates of rheumatic heart
disease may be as high as 35-40 per thousand individuals. By one estimate, it affects nearly six millon
school-age children in India. Although the incidence of ARF in the United States and other Western
countries declined markedly during the later half of the twentieth century, there has been a
remarkable resurgence of the disease in the United States.Streptococci are a group of bacteria with the capacity to grow in chains. Many
varieties are part of the normal bacterial flora in humans and are not especially harmful. However,
a particular subgroup of streptococcal bacteria, called Group A and represented by Streptococcus
pyogenes, is a human pathogen. Between 20 and 30 millon cases of Group A streptococcal infections
occur every year in the United States alone. These cases include infections of the skin and throat,
forms of pneumonia and a recently identified disease resembling toxic shock. The most common
infection is acute streptococcal pharyngitis, or strep throat, which occurs predominantly in school-age
children. Strep throat qualifies as a major worldwide health problem if judged only by time lost from
school and work and by the amount spent on related doctor's fees.Strep throat's toll is much greater, however. In as many as 4% of the pharyngitis cases
that are untreated or treated ineffectively, the strep infection leads to ARF. Current attempts to
prevent ARF rely on treatment of the pharyngitis with antibiotics. During a recent outbreak of ARF 
in Utah, only a fourth of the patients sought health care prior to the onset of symptoms, and only a
third recalled a recent sore throat. The finding that ARF may follow a subclinical infection in such
a high percentage of individuals and the fact that access to health care in developing countries is not
widely available serve to underscore the need for a safe and effective vaccine against Group A
streptococci.The causal relationship between streptococcal pharyngitis and ARF was established
over 50 years ago, yet the mechanism of the pathogenesis of the disease remains unclear. It is widely
held that ARF is an autoimmune disease, and that in the susceptible host the infection
