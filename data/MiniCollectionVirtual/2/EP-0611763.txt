<ABSTRACT>
A process of preparing a purified crown compound is 
disclosed which comprises the steps of (a) dissolving a crown 

compound and a salt in an organic solvent to form a solution 
of a complex salt of a crown compound; (b) filtering the 

solution to obtain a filtrate; (c) adding water to the 
filtrate to produce a precipitate; and (d) filtering out the 

produced precipitate.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a process for purifying 
a crown compound. Crown compounds have found extensive applications such as 
phase transfer catalysts for organic syntheses, selective 
capture and separation of metal ions, resolution of optical 
isomers of amino acids, uses in ion selective electrodes, and 
uses in pharmaceuticals, agricultural chemicals, photographic 
emulsions, etc. To facilitate the use of crown compounds in these areas, 
it is desired that highly purified crown compounds be able to 
be obtained more easily at cheaper prices. As processes for synthesizing crown compounds, those 
described in J.Am.Chem. Soc. Vol. 89, p. 7017 (1967), for 
example, are known; however, there are no description on any 
purification process capable of providing a crown compound of  
 
adequate purity. Organic Syntheses, vol. 52, p. 66 (1972) 
describes a process for recrystallizing crown compounds from 
benzene or dioxane, but the process shown therein has 
disadvantages such as inabilities of providing an adequate 
purity or a high yield, use of toxic solvents, high costs, 
etc. Further, crown compounds include those which are liquid 
at ordinary temperature and can be hardly purified by 
recrystallization, an example of which is 15-crown-5. Crown 
compounds are relatively stable to heat and may be purified by 
distillation; but, distillation of ethers such as crown 
compounds on an industrial scale is not favorable because 
ethers are liable to yield explosive peroxides when contacted 
with air at high temperature. As described above, there has not been found so far any 
process capable of purifying safely and efficiently crown 
compounds which are liquid at ordinary temperature; therefore, 
development of such a process is desired. Accordingly, an object of the present invention is to 
provide a process for purifying crown compounds which can give 
pure crown compounds cheaply, easily and efficiently. The above problem is solved by
