<ABSTRACT>
An ink jet head is disclosed for use with a drop-on 
demand type printer, and includes an insulating base (201), a plurality 

of elongated barriers (205) projecting upwardly from the base so as to 
form a plurality of slots (202) between the barriers, a plurality of 

nozzle holes (203) communicating with the slots, and electrodes formed 
on the side walls of the elongated barriers. Voltage can be 

applied to the various barriers through the electrodes in order 
to cause deflection of the barriers and a corresponding reduction 

in the cross-sectional area of selected slots, so as to force ink 
contained in the slots to be jetted through the nozzle holes. In 

order to provide a uniform ink jet intensity from the outermost 
slots relative to the inner slots, dummy slots can be formed 

outwardly of the outermost active slots by providing dummy 
barriers outwardly of the outermost active barriers. In addition, 

the nozzle holes are formed in a lid (208). The lid is 
mounted atop the 

base. When mounted atop the base, possible breakage of the ends 
of the barriers is less of a problem. Further, the plurality of 

barriers can either be mounted to the base by an adhesive, or can 
be formed integrally with the base. Also, the ink jet head can 

be formed with two bases, one atop the other, with the barriers 
of the bases being polarized in opposite directions.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an ink jet printer
head for a drop-on demand (DOD) type printer.Among non-impact type printers, ink jet printers have
recently become quite popular, due, in large part, to the fact
that they operate on a relatively simple principle and are
suitable for use in colour printing. Of the non-impact type
printers, continuous ink jet type printers were first developed,
with DOD type printers being more recently developed. Such DOD
type printers do not continuously jet ink, but rather jet ink
only when it is necessary to form a dot. Currently, these DOD
type printers are more popular than the continuous ink jet type
printers.A typical DOD type printer is a Kyser type printer such
as that disclosed in Japanese patent publication No. 12138/1978.
However, such Kyser DOD type printers are burdened by the fact
that they are quite difficult to miniaturize.Another typical DOD type printer is a thermal jet type
such as that disclosed in Japanese patent publication No. 59914/1986.
However, such thermal jet type printers are burdened by
the fact that the ink used therein must be heated to a relatively
high temperature, thus resulting in burning and sticking of the
ink.Accordingly, as disclosed in Japanese patent laid-open
No. 252750/1988 (and EP-A-0278590), a shear mode type DOD printer has been developed
in order to overcome the above-noted problems confronting these
typical DOD type printers. The construction and principles of
operation of this shear mode type printer will now be described
with reference to Figures 7-10 and 18. As best shown in Figures 9(a) and 9(b), a plurality of
elongated barriers 95ab, 95bc, and 95cd are bonded onto a base
105 by an adhesion layer 108 in such a manner as to form narrow
slots 92a, 92b, and 92c which define ink chambers and flow paths.
The ink for these narrow slots 92a, 92b and 92c is to be supplied
from a common ink reservoir 187 defined at first ends of the
slots 92a, 92b and 92c so as to be in communication, as best seen
in Figures 10 and 18, with the narrow slots.Second ends of the slots 92 are substantially closed by
a nozzle plate 100 bonded to the ends of the barriers 95. The
nozzle plate 100 has a plurality of small nozzle holes 93a-93f
formed therein in communication with each of the slots 92a-92f,
respectively.A lid 106 is bonded to upper surfaces of the barriers
95 by a flexible elastic material 109 in such a manner that the
barriers 95 are flexible in lateral directions relative to the
lid 106 (see Fig. 9(b)).The base 105 is to have
