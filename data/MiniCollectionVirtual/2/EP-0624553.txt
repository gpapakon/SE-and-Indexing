<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a process for
producing a titanium oxide compound suitable for use in
the fields of coating, printing, resin pigmenting,
cosmetics, optical memories, etc. which utilize a
chromatic effect known as photochromism.A unique function of reversibly changing color
according to an intensity variation of light, that is
photochromism, is exploited in a variety of applications,
such as sunglasses. As chemical substances
displaying photochromism, silver halides and spiropyran
series organic compounds are already known. As to
titanium oxide, it is known to exhibit photochromism in
the presence of certain metals such as iron, chromium and
manganese and such systems are disclosed in Japanese
Unexamined Patent Publications (Kokai) Nos. 132811/1988,
364117/1992, 17152/1993 and 51209/1993, International
Patent Publication WO-89/12084 and so on.However, compositions prepared by calcining a
simple powdery mixture of titanium oxide with a powder of
photochromism-imparting metal or its salt such as 
sulfate, chloride, nitrate, acetate, etc., its oxide or
its hydroxide, as proposed in the above patent
literature, achieve only a weak level of photochromism.
As a matter of fact, the photochromic effect of this
level is diluted when other components are conjointly
used as admixed therewith in various applications, with
the result that significant color change is hardly
observed. Thus, these compositions are not sufficiently
satisfactory for practical purposes.An object of this invention is to provide a
process for producing a titanium oxide compound
displaying an excellent photochromism which can be
used in various fields.This and other objects of the invention will
become apparent from the following description.The
above object can be solved by a process as defined below which
comprises mixing an organotitanium compound with a
photochromism-imparting metal-containing organic compound
in a specific fashion, subjecting the resultant mixture
to cohydrolysis and calcining the hydrolyzate. Thus the present invention provides a process
for producing a photochromic titanium oxide compound
which comprises the steps of
(i) dissolving at least one organotitanium compound
and in an amount of 0.05 to 8.0 weight % calculated as the corresponding
metal oxide relative to the amount of the resulting titanium oxide
compound
at least one organic compound containing at least one
metal selected from the group consisting of sodium, iron,
chromium, copper, nickel, vanadium, manganese, silicon,
zinc, aluminum, cerium,
