<ABSTRACT>
A method of demodulating an FM carrier wave and a demodulating 
circuit are described which utilise a gain control circuit. 

An output is supplied from the gain control circuit to a phase 
locked loop circuit tuned to a selected carrier wave 

frequency. A first output of the phase locked loop circuit is 
used to generate a tuned gain control signal dependent on the 

amplitude of the input FM carrier wave to which the phase 
locked loop is tuned and the tuned gain control signal is used 

to control the gain of the gain control circuit.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to the demodulation of FM carrier waves
to generate an audio signal and particularly to apparatus for,
and methods of, demodulation of an FM sound carrier when a
plurality of carrier frequencies are present.The present invention is particularly applicable to satellite
receiver sound demodulation where a plurality of carrier
frequencies of 5 MHz to 10 MHz may be present. The modulation
of each carrier wave may vary from ± 50 KHz to ± 200 KHz and
the carrier frequency separation will commonly be greater than
180 KHz. The frequency modulation of each carrier will be
such as to avoid frequency overlap of adjacent carrier waves
due to their respective modulations. Such systems may be used
to produce hi-fi quality audio sound.Known demodulation systems for such FM sound carriers normally
translate the frequency of the selected carrier to a known
frequency and the signal is then processed by a single high Q
narrow band pass filter. The single carrier frequency is then
FM demodulated. Each of the carrier frequencies in the
composite signal must be shifted to the same known frequency
when it is required to tune onto that selected carrier
frequency. To handle stereo signals two such filters are
required and as the band pass filter used will have a selected
band width, it is necessary to use a plurality of filters to
allow for the variation in modulation which may be permitted
for different carrier frequencies. The use of such frequency
translation when using a common filter presents more problems
in providing an economic solution on integrated circuit
chips.Phase locked loops have been used for FM demodulation but have
presented problems where a plurality of carrier waves of close
frequency have been present. Such phase locked loop circuits
have presented problems of stability due to variable gain with
process variations particularly on an integrated circuit 
implementation and they have also been sensitive to variations
in the input signal amplitude.Published Japanese Application JP-A-62 012 288 discloses a phase
locked loop type FM demodulator having a gain control amplifier
to amplify the FM input signal before the signal is demodulated.
The gain of the gain control amplifier is carried in response to
both an error signal from the phase locked loop and a signal
indicative of the amount of noise present in the demodulated
output signal.European Patent Application EP-A-0 398 254 discloses an FM
demodulator having a variable gain amplifier for amplifying the
FM input signal. The FM input
