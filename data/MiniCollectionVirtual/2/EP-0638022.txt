<ABSTRACT>
A pressing device comprises a housing (6) comprising a slide plate (8) mounted for rectilinear movement at an angle at about 45 DEG  to the horizontal. The rear end of the slide plate (8) is provided with spaced flanges (20, 21) between which at spaced positions widthwise of the slide plate two fixed nuts (22) are provided. Extending in each of the fixed nuts (22) is an adjustment screw (24a

 _), each of said screws (24) being secured at its forward end to one end region of a presser plate (26). Thus, by rotation of the adjusting screws, the position of the presser plate (26) is adjusted relative to the flange (20). Mounted above the slide plate (8) at a position below the presser plate (26) and facing the presser plate (26) is a base plate (40), fixed in relation to the machine housing, the base plate and slide plate together providing the support for the binding element. Extending around the two adjustment screws (24a

<DESCRIPTION>
Title: "Pressing device for a binding machine" Description of InventionThis invention is concerned with improvements relating to binding machines; and in particular to a pressing device for a binding machine.A known method of binding perforated sheets uses binding elements which are afforded by lengths of wire bent so as to form curved prongs on which the sheets may be impaled. The elements are provided, at the time of the impaling operation generally, in the form of a tube having a longitudinal slot in the wall, and the final stage in the binding process involves closing the slot by bringing the closed ends of the prongs into their open ends.Such binding elements (hereinafter referred to as being of the kind specified) are provided in a variety of sizes, and in a variety of pitches, enabling an appropriate element to be selected for a particular binding operation, and it is of course desirable that a binding machine (conventionally comprising a punch, to punch a row of holes along one edge of a stack of sheets, and a pressing device, to deform the binding element to a closed condition) be capable of being used with a variety of such binding elements.According to this invention there is provided a pressing device for clamping a binding element of the kind specified around the spine of a stack of sheets, comprising a support, on against which a binding element may be placed, and a presser member movable to effect closing of the binding element, characterised by the provision of an adjustment mechanism comprising two screw- threaded devices operable to move the presser member to accommodate binding elements of different sizes, means being provided to ensure simultaneous and equal adjustment of the two screw-threaded devices.In this manner, substantially rectilinear approach and separation between the presser member and the support may be ensured.Preferably the support on which the binding element is placed is provided in part at least by a relatively fixed base, conveniently in the form of a plate, against which a binding element may be placed. 

 Preferably the device comprises operating means to move the presser member towards the base plate in a pressing operation, and away therefrom, the adjustment mechanism being interposed between the operating means and the presser member.The operating means may comprise a slide member upon which the adjustment mechanism is mounted, the presser member being carried by the slide member in the operation of the device.Preferably the two screw-threaded devices are

<CLAIMS>
CLAIMS
1. A pressing device for clamping a binding element (50) of the kind specified around the spine of a stack(s) of sheets, the device comprising a support (8, 40) on which a binding element may be placed, and a presser member (26) movable to effect closing of the binding element, characterised by the provision of an adjustment mechanism provided by two screw-threaded devices (24a, 24b) operable to move the presser member (26) to accommodate binding elements of different sizes, means (30, 36) being provided to ensure simultaneous and equal adjustment of the two screw-threaded devices.
2. A pressing device according to Claim 1 wherein the support is provided in part at least by a relatively fixed base (40) against which a binding element may be placed.
3. A pressing device according to Claims 1 and 2 comprising operating means (10, 12) to move the presser member (26) towards the base plate (40) in a pressing operation, and away therefrom, the adjustment mechanism being interposed between the operating means (10, 12) and the presser member (26).
4. A pressing device according to Claim 3 wherein the operating means comprises a slide member (8) upon which the adjustment mechanism (30, 36)is mounted, the presser member being carried by the slide member in the operation of the device.
5. A pressing device according to Claim 4 wherein the two screw- threaded devices (24a, 24b) are carried by the slide member (8) and in turn support the presser member (26).
6. A pressing device according to one of Claims 4 and 5 wherein the slide member (8) also affords part of the support for the binding element (50). 


 7. A pressing device according to Claim 6 wherein the slide member (8) is afforded by a plate extending at right angles to the base plate (40).
>
8. A pressing device according to Claim 7 wherein the slide plate (8) is inclined to the horizontal axis conveniently at an angle of between 30 and 60Â°.
9. A pressing device according to any one of the preceding claims wherein the two screw-threaded devices are connected together by a flexible endless element (36).
10. A pressing device according to Claim 9 wherein the flexible elongate element is capable of being moved in an adjustment operation by rotation of a wheel (30) of relatively large diameter.
