<DESCRIPTION>
Method and machine for laminating a decorative layer to the surface of a three-dimensional object.This invention refers to a method for laminating a decorative layer to the surface of a three-dimensional object in a membrane press comprising two chambers which are separated by a membrane and can be subject to different air pressures, one of the chambers containing the object to be decorated, wherein the object to be decorated is brought into contact with the decorative layer, which is pressed against the said surface of the object by a pressure difference in the two chambers acting on the membrane.A further subject of the invention is a machine for applying at least one decorative layer to a surface of a three-dimensional object comprising an upper, hood shaped pressure chamber, heating means within the pressure chamber, means for tightly clamping a membrane forming the decorative layer to lower edges of the pressure chamber, a supporting plate for the object to be decorated, means for vertically moving the pressure chamber and the supporting plate, resp., in order to bring the supporting plate and the pressure chamber into and out of contact with each other and to bring the surface of the object to be decorated into contact with the decorative layer, and pressure means for applying pressure to the space limited by the pressure chamber and the membrane as well as suction 

means for applying suction to the space between the membrane and the supporting plate for the object.Many different laminating methods and machines are known in the trade. Machines for laminating decorative sheet material to large flat surfaces usually employ one or more rollers for rolling the sheet material onto the said flat surfaces. However, where the surface of the object is sharply curved or angled, it is not always possible to make use of rollers to apply the decorative sheet material since the rollers are not designed to reach into all the sharp curves and corners.There are also known machines for laminating decorative sheet material to an object which includes sharply curving or angled surfaces. Such machines comprise a base and a hollow head, the open bottom of which is sealed by a flexible diaphragm or membrane (EP-A2 0.302.703). In use the three-dimensional object to be laminated is placed on the base and the decorative sheet material to be laminated to the surface of the object is placed over the object. Thereafter the hollow head is placed over the object with the membrane engaging the object. Thereafter air is pumped
