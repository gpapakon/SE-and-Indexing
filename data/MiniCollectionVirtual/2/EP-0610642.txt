<ABSTRACT>
An inverter for the supply of one or more discharge lamps 
(11; 111A, 111B) with heated electrodes (13, 15), 

comprises: a load circuit with a series resonant circuit 
(17, 19, 21, 117A, 117B; 119; 121) and at least one lamp 

(11, 111A, 111B), two controllable switches (7, 9; 107, 
109) and a control circuit (25) for the said switches, 

causing the said switches to conduct alternately. A 
normally isolated dissipative component (33; 133), which 

is connected, when the voltage across the load circuit 
exceeds a given value, to the load circuit, thus 

modifying its figure of merit to limit the maximum 
voltage without varying the resonant frequency of the 

load circuit.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to an inverter for the supply 
of one or more discharge lamps with heated electrodes, of 
the type stated in the preamble of the principal claim. An inverter of this type is described, for example, 
in Patent EP-B-O, 113, 451. In this patent, a load 
circuit, comprising a series resonant circuit and a 
discharge lamp, is associated with a special circuit to 
prevent the appearance of unacceptable excess voltages 
across the lamp, particularly in the starter transient. 
For this purpose, a voltage-dependent resistor and a 
capacitor are connected together in series, in parallel 
with a branch comprising the inductance of the resonant 
circuit. With this arrangement, when the voltage across 
the lamp exceeds a certain limit value, depending on the 
variable resistor, the latter becomes conducting. This 
produces a variation in the resonant frequency of the 
load circuit, changing it from the supply frequency and 
consequently limiting the voltage across the lamp. The present invention relates to a circuit of the 
type mentioned initially, with a different system of 
limiting the voltage applied to the lamp. The invention is defined in Claim 1. It is substantially based on 
the concept of using a resonant load circuit in which it is possible 
to connect a dissipative component, which has no effect 
on the resonant frequency of the said load circuit, but 
changes its figure of merit. The inverter according to the invention is therefore 
substantially characterised by a normally isolated 
dissipative component, which is connected, when the 
voltage across the load circuit exceeds a given value, to  
 
the load circuit, thus modifying its figure of merit to 
limit the maximum voltage without varying the resonant 
frequency of the load circuit. In a practical embodiment of the inverter according 
to the invention, there is placed, in a shunt in parallel 
with a branch containing at least one of the components 
of the load circuit, a voltage-dependent resistor, in 
series with a dissipative component of the resistive 
type, the said voltage-dependent resistor becoming 
conducting at a limit value of the voltage applied across 
it. From NL-A-9000175 a supply circuit with an oscillator 
for a gas discharge lamp is known, wherein a voltage 
divider is connected to the resonant load circuit. 
In one embodiment disclosed therein the voltage divider 
includes a varistor. The voltage at the tap of the voltage 
divider is used to control the voltage applied to 
the load. However, in this known
