<ABSTRACT>
An arrangement of fuel rod (6) support members consisting 
of dimples (9) and springs (10) is presented to prevent abrasive 

wear of the fuel rods (6) caused by bouncing of the fuel rods 
(6) against the supporting members (9, 10) caused by vibrations 

in a diagonal direction of the support grids (4). The 
supporting members (9, 10) are disposed such that dimples (9) 

are provided on one pair of adjacent walls (11a, 11d) located on 
one side of the vibrational direction while springs (10) are 

provided on adjacent walls (11b, 11c) located on the opposite 
side of the vibrational direction.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates in general to fuel assemblies 
for nuclear reactors, and relates in particular to a fuel 
assembly for preventing abrasion of fuel rods caused by 
vibrations in the fuel assembly. A known example of a fuel assembly for a pressurized light 
water reactor is shown in Figure 2. The fuel assembly shown in this drawing is provided with an 
upper nozzle 1, and a lower nozzle 2 which is oppositely spaced 
apart from the upper nozzle 1. A plurality of control rod guide 
pipes 3 are fixedly disposed between the upper nozzle 1 and the 
lower nozzle 2, and a plurality of support grids 4 are attached 
to the control rod guide pipes 3 in the middle section of the 
fuel assembly with a certain spacing, and a plurality of fuel 
rods (6) are inserted through and supported by the support grids 
(4). As shown in Figure 3, each of the support grids 4 comprises 
a plurality of straps 7 crossing at right angles to each other 
to produce a grid network and a plurality of square-shaped grid 
cells 5 therein. A plurality of dimples 9 and springs 10 are 
provided on the opposing walls surrounding each of the grid 
cells 5 to elastically hold the fuel rods 6 which are inserted 
through the grid cells 5.  
 The dimples 9 and the springs 10 are disposed in the grid 
cells 5 in the pattern shown in Figure 3. Dividing the support 
grid 4 in a plan view into four quadrants S1, S2, S3 and S4 in a 
counter-clockwise designation about an origin O, equivalent to 
the center of the support grid 4. In the first quadrant S1, of 
the four walls defining each square-shaped grid cell 5, the 
dimples 9 are formed on the left and bottom walls while the 
springs 10 are formed on the right and top walls. In the second 
quadrant S2, the dimples 9 and the springs 10 are formed 
symmetrically to those in the first quadrant S1 with respect to 
the Y-axis. In the third quadrant S3, the dimples 9 and the 
springs 10 are formed symmetrically to those in the first 
quadrant S1 with respect to the origin O. In the fourth 
quadrant S4, the dimples 9 and the springs 10 are formed 
symmetrically to those in the first quadrant S1 with respect to 
the X-axis. The fuel assembly comprising such support grids 4 is 
provided with a plurality of mixing vanes (not shown) formed at 
the intersections of the straps 7, for the purpose of stirring 
the cooling water for removing the heat generated by the fuel 
rods efficiently. It is thought that, in a plan view of the grid, the 
turbulent flows caused by the presence of these mixing vanes
