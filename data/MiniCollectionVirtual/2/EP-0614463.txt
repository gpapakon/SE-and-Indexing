<ABSTRACT>
Angiostatic steroids for use in controlling neovascularization and ocular hypertension are disclosed. Pharmaceutical compositions of the angiostatic steroids and methods for their use in treating neovascularization and ocular hypertension, including controlling the ocular hypertension associated with primary open angle glaucoma, are disclosed. In addition, the combination of the compounds with glucocorticoids for the prevention of elevated intraocular pressure during the treatment of inflammation is disclosed.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to the use of an angiostatic steroid for the preparation of a medicament for
preventing and treating
neovascularization.Steroids functioning to inhibit angiogenesis in the presence of heparin
or specific heparin fragments are disclosed in Crum, et al., A New Class of
Steroids Inhibits Angiogenesis in the Presence of Heparin or a Heparin
Fragment, Science, Vol.230, pp.1375-1378 (December 20, 1985). The authors
refer to such steroids as "angiostatic" steroids. Included within the new
class of steroids found to be angiostatic are the dihydro and tetrahydro
metabolites of cortisol and cortexolone. In a follow-up study directed to
testing a hypothesis as to the mechanism by which the steroids inhibit
angiogenesis, it was shown that heparin/angiostatic steroid compositions cause
dissolution of the basement membrane scaffolding to which anchorage dependent
endothelia are attached resulting in capillary involution; see, Ingber, et
al., A Possible Mechanism for Inhibition of Angiogenesis by Angiostatic
Steroids: Induction of Capillary Basement Membrane Dissolution, Endocrinology
Vol. 119, pp.1768-1775 1986).A group of tetrahydro steroids useful in inhibiting angiogenesis is
disclosed in International Patent Application No WO-87/02672, Aristoff, 
et al., (The Upjohn Company). The compounds are disclosed for use in treating
head trauma, spinal trauma, septic or traumatic shock, stroke and hemorrhage
shock. In addition, the patent application discusses the utility of these
compounds in embryo implantation and in the treatment of cancer, arthritis and
arteriosclerosis. Some of the steroids disclosed in Aristoff et al. are
disclosed in U.S. Patent No. 4,771,042 in combination with heparin or a
heparin fragment for inhibiting angiogenesis in a warm blooded animal.Compositions of hydrocortisone, "tetrahydrocortisol-S," and U-72,745G,
each in combination with a beta cyclodextrin, have been shown to inhibit
corneal neovascularization: Li, et al., Angiostatic Steroids Potentiated by
Sulphated Cyclodextrin Inhibit Corneal Neovascularization, Investigative
Ophthalmology and Visual Science, Vol. 32, No. 11, pp. 2898-2905 (October,
1991). The steroids alone reduce neovascularization somewhat but are not
effective alone in effecting regression of neovascularization.Tetrahydrocortisol (THF) has been disclosed for its use in lowering the
intraocular pressure (IOP) of rabbits made hypertensive with dexamethasone
alone, or with dexamethasone/5-beta-dihydrocortisol; see Southren, et al.,
Intraocular
