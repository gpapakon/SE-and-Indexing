<ABSTRACT>
Filter auxiliaries (11) are cleaned of organic deposits are cleaned by putting the uncleaned filter auxiliaries (11) into suspension followed by acoustic irradiation to release the deposits (9) and break them down into smaller fractions. The filter auxiliaries (11) and deposits (9) are separated in a separation device (25), e.g. a centrifuge (25). The process is applicable, for instance, to the production of beer and fruit juices.

Method of loosening and separating deposits from
filtering aids, wherein


the filtering aids are introduced into an acoustic
irradiation zone together with an acoustic irradiation

fluid,
the deposits are loosened from the filtering
aids by an acoustic irradiation process using sound waves,

and subsequently
the filtering aids are retained in a separating
device in the form of a filter layer, and acoustic

irradiation fluid and deposits are conducted through the
filter layer and eliminated.
Method according to claim 1, characterised in that
the acoustic irradiation fluid, together with the loosened

deposits and the filtering aids, are conducted from the
acoustic irradiation zone into the separating device.
Method according to claim 1, characterised in that
the deposits are split-up and separated by acoustic

irradiation whilst being kept in their mutually liberated
form.
Method according to one of claims 1 to 3,
characterised in that the acoustic irradiation of the

filtering aids, charged with deposits, is effected in an
alkaline acoustic irradiation fluid with a leach

concentration of less than 2 %.
Method according to one of claims 1 to 4,
characterised in that the separation of the deposits and

the acoustic irradiation fluid from the filtering aids is
effected by centrifuging. 
Method of separating filtering aids and deposits
loosened therefrom and treatment fluid used therefor

according to one of the preceding claims 1 to 5,
characterised in that the treatment fluid, with the

deposits which are contained therein and are present in
their liberated form, and the filtering aids are

continuously supplied to a separating device, in which the
filtering aids are retained and form a filter layer, which

continuously becomes thicker, and through which layer the
treatment fluid with the deposits is guided, and the

deposits and the treatment fluid are separated from the
filtering aids.
Method according to one of claims 1 to 6,
characterised in that the filtering aids are rinsed again

with fluid during the separation process.
Method according to claim 7, characterised in that
the pH value of the filtering aids is reduced by the

rinsing fluid.
Method according to one of claims 1 to 8,
characterised in that the treatment of the filtering

aids is effected chargewisely or on-line.
Method according to one of claims 4 to 9,
characterised in that the filtering aids are rinsed from

the filtering device with an alkaline fluid and treated.
Method according to one of claims 1 to 10,
characterised in that the filtering aids are kept in the

suspended state at a temperature of approx. 85° C and
sterilised.
Method according to one of claims 1 to 10,
characterised in that the filtering aids, separated from

deposits, are suspended, sterilised at a temperature of 
approx. 85° C and, in the heated state, metered out to a

filtering device in the concentration usual for the
filtration.
Apparatus for loosening and separating deposits
from filtering aids, comprising an acoustic irradiation

zone for introducing an acoustic irradiation fluid and the
filtering aids, an acousti
c irradiation device for
transferring vibrations to the acoustic irradiation fluid

and the filtering aids situated therein and for loosening
the deposits from the filtering aids, a separating device

for forming a filter layer from filtering aids which are
introduced into the separating device and for guiding the

deposits, previously loosened from the filtering aids in
the acoustic irradiation zone, and the acoustic irradiation

fluid through the built-up filter layer.
Apparatus according to claim 13, characterised in
that a centrifuge (25) is used as the separating device.
Apparatus according to one of claims 13 or 14,
characterised in that a sound probe (2) is immersed in the

acoustic irradiation medium as the acoustic irradiation
device and, by its effect, loosens the deposits introduced

therein and adhering to the filtering aids.
Apparatus according to claim 15, characterised in
that the deposits are split-up into smaller fractions by

the acoustic irradiation.
Use of the methods according to one of claims 1 to
12 for purifying diatomaceous earth generally, for

purifying and processing diatomaceous earth prior to the
initial use as a filtering aid, for purifying and

regenerating diatomaceous earth and/or additional
substances from the filtration process. 
Use of the methods according to one of claims 1 to
12 for the production of beer, wine and fruit juice, or for

the regeneration of filtering aids in chemical methods.
