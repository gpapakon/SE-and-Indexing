<DESCRIPTION>
 APPARATUS FOR EMPTYING A HAZARDOUS WASTE CONTAINERTECHNICAL FIELDThis invention relates to devices having utility in the field of hazardous waste disposal. More particularly, it relates to a device having utility in emptying a container having blood and other body fluids therein.BACKGROUND ARTBlood and other body fluids are lost when a patient undergoes surgery, and many different containers have been invented for collecting said lost blood and other fluids. Some of the containers are designed to be disposed of while still containing the fluids therein, and other containers are designed to be emptied so that they can be reused. Other con¬ tainers are designed to be emptied but not reused. Typically, a flexible hose extends from the patient's body to the collection device and the fluids are con- 

tinually vacuumed into the collection device throughout the surgical procedure.One of the most widely used fluid collec¬ tion devices is a chest-drainage device known as the Pleur-Vac; it is made by Deknatel (a Pfizer company) and is the subject of U.S. patent Nos. 4,018,224, 4,955,874, and others. The leading end of a first flexible hose extends from the patient's chest cavity to an inlet of the Pleur-Vac, and a second flexible hose or suction tube extends from an outlet of the unit to a source of negative pressure; the unit is designed so that blood and pleural fluid collect in the device and cannot enter the suction tube. The device is also designed so that the fluids entering it are trapped in a labyrinth, and cannot be easily emp¬ tied therefrom without exposing the operator and others in the operating theater to the hazards of contact by splashing and aerosolizationsiite.When the surgical procedure is completed, the Pleur-Vac is disconnected from the patient and theSUBSTITUTE SHEET 

fluids collected therein may be safely and legally disposed of by introducing them into a sanitary sewer. However, the only known means of emptying the unit is to manually and alternately rotate it so that the fluids may escape the labyrinth and flow therefrom under the influence of gravity. Thus the person charged with this task, and others are exposed to contact.OSHA regulations require that blood, pleu- ral fluids, and other body fluids be handled in such a manner that the handlers and those in the vicinity of the handlers are not exposed to such fluids or aerosols thereof, and recommend that the fluids be carefully introduced to the sanitary sewer at or near the point of generation. The only known and present method of

WHAT IS CLAIMED IS:
1. An apparatus that removes fluids from a container, said apparatus being in fluid communication with a source of a preselected liquid fluid under pressure, comprising:
a first conduit in fluid communication with said source of a preselected liquid fluid under pressure;
a first on-off valve for selectively admitting said preselected liquid fluid into said first conduit;
said first on-off valve having a normally "open" configuration so that said preselected liquid fluid is always in said first conduit;
a second on-off valve, disposed in said first conduit downstream of said first on-off valve, for selectively admitting said preselected liquid fluid into the apparatus; 


 said second on-off valve having a normally "closed" configuration;
a venturi device through which flows said preselected liquid fluid only when said second on-off valve is placed in an "open" configuration by a human operator;
said second on-off valve being disposed between said first on-off valve and said venturi de¬ vice;
a check valve disposed between said con¬ tainer and said venturi device so that fluids may' flow in a forward direction from said container into said venturi device but not in a reverse direction relative to said forward direction;
a vacuum breaker disposed between said first on-off valve and said venturi device so that said preselected liquid fluid under pressure flows in a forward direction from said first on-off valve to said 


venturi device but not in a reverse direction relative to said forward direction;
a second conduit for providing fluid commu¬ nication between the interior of the container to be emptied and said venturi device; and
a third conduit disposed in fluid communi¬ cation between an outlet of said venturi device and a sanitary sewer;
whereby said preselected liquid fluid flowing through said venturi device entrains the fluids from said container and carries said fluids through said third conduit to said sanitary sewer only when said second on-off valve is opened by a human operator.
