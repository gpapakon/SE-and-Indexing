<ABSTRACT>
A saw (10) comprises a frame, a table (12) mounted in the frame 
and adapted to adopt two positions. A pivot member (14) is on a 

first side of the table and a saw assembly (16) is pivoted (at 18) to 
the pivot member. A blade (26) is journalled in the assembly and a 

motor (22) drives the blade. A spring (124) between the pivot 
member and saw assembly biasses the saw assembly away from the 

table a slot in the table permits the blade to protrude through the 
table. 
In a first of said two positions of the table, the saw assembly is 
above the table and the saw is a chop saw for performing plunge cuts 

on workpieces supported on said first side of the table (Figure 1). In 
a second of said two positions, the saw assembly as below the table 

and the saw is a bench saw for performing cuts on workpieces 
passed through the blade on a second opposite side of the table 

(Figure 2). 
The spring acts on an intermediate element (114,132) which has 
two dispositions, in a first of which the spring supports the weight of 

the saw assembly when the table is in its first position. In the second 
disposition the spring bias is released.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to circular saws of the type comprising a 
table, a pivot member on the table and a saw assembly pivoted about 
a pivot axis with respect to said pivot member, whereby said saw 
assembly carrying a motor driven blade can be plunged into a 
workpiece supported on the table. Such saws are known and described in published patent 
documents such as EP 0133666 and EP 0450400. These saws are 
useful and have numerous possibilities for enhancement to improve 
the capacity, capability and efficiency, not to mention cleanliness 
and safety of their arrangements. On the other hand, all these 
features add complexity and cost, and may render the saw user 
unfriendly. The present invention particularly relates to saws of the type 
described above but which in addition have the table mounted in a 
frame such that the table may be inverted, as by pivoting about an 
axis, so that the saw assembly is then beneath the table. The table is 
in addition provided with a slot so that the blade can protrude 
through the slot to render the saw a bench or table saw. Such saws 
are known and described in DE 1628992 and EP 0502350. Both EP 0133666 and EP 0450400 mentioned above describe 
saws in which the saw assembly comprises an upper guard and a 
lower guard for the blade. The upper guard is formed from the 
housing of the assembly and pennanently covers a top part of the 
blade. A bottom part of the blade is covered by the lower guard but  
 
this must be withdrawn in use so that the blade is exposed when 
required to perform cutting operations. A handle is disposed on the upper guard by means of which a 
user can pivot the saw assembly up and down to perform cutting 
operations on a workpiece supported on the table. The lower guard may be opened entirely by an actuating lever 
disposed on said handle. Alternatively the guard may be opened 
automatically by pivoting of the saw assembly, there being provided 
a connection between the guard and the pivot member for this 
purpose. A further alternative is that the guard may be opened partly 
by either of these arrangements and only further opened by direct 
contact with a workpiece. Means must be provided to bias the saw assembly to a raised, 
upright position when it is at rest so that the user is not required to 
lift the not-insignificant weight of the saw assembly after completing 
a plunge cut. Such means is normally in the form of a powerful 
spring. However, a problem arises when the saw is of the second type 
mentioned above and the table is

A saw comprising a frame, a table mounted in the frame and 
adapted to adopt two positions, a pivot member on a first side of the 

table, a saw assembly pivoted with respect to the pivot member, a 
blade journalled in said assembly, a motor to drive the blade, spring 

means between the pivot member and saw assembly to bias the saw 
assembly away from the table, a slot in the table through which said 

blade is adapted to protrude, in a first of said two positions of the 
table the saw assembly being above the table, the saw thereby 

forming a chop saw for performing plunge cuts on workpieces 
supported on said first side of the table, and, in a second of said two 

positions of the table, the saw assembly being below the table and 
the saw thereby forming a bench saw for performing cuts on 

workpieces passed through the blade on a second opposite side of 
the table, said spring means acting on an intermediate element 

having two dispositions, in a first of which dispositions said spring 
means supports the weight of the said saw assembly when the table 

is in its first position and in a second of which dispositions said bias 
is substantially removed. 
A saw as claimed in claim 1, which further comprises an upper 
guard to cover an upper portion of the blade, the guard being pivoted 

to said assembly, and a parallelogram lever having a pivotal 
connection to the pivot member and upper guard whereby the 

orientation of said upper guard with respect to said pivot member is 
maintained, and an extension of said parallelogram lever co-operates  

 
with depth of cut adjustment means when said intermediate element 

is in its second disposition and when the saw assembly is in its 
second position. 
A saw as claimed in claim 2, in which said adjustment means 
comprises a worm gear rotationally mounted in a carrier member, 

which member is adjustably connected to said pivot member, and 
said extension has a rack to engage said worm gear, rotation of the 

worm gear when engaged with said rack serving to pivot said 
parallelogram lever about its pivot to the pivot member to alter the 

depth of protrusion of the blade through the slot. 
A saw as claimed in claim 3, in which said carrier member is 
pivoted to said pivot member and said intermediate element 

comprises a toggle lever pivoted to the pivot member, which toggle 
lever in said first disposition tensions said spring means and, in 

pivoting to said second disposition, releases said tension and pivots 
said carrier into engagement with said extension. 
A saw as claimed in claim 4, in which said carrier and toggle 
lever are pivoted about the same axis in said pivot member. 
A saw as claimed in any preceding claim, in which said spring 
means comprises a torsion spring around the pivot axis of the saw 

assembly in the pivot member, one end of said spring pressing 
against the saw assembly and the other end engaging said 

intermediate element. 
A saw as claimed in claim 6, in which an intermediate lever is 
disposed between said other end of the spring and said intermediate 

element.  
 
A saw as claimed in claim 7, in which said other end of the 
spring is pivoted to said intermediate lever about a first axis, said 

intermediate lever is pivoted to said intermediate element about a 
second axis and said intermediate element is pivoted to said pivot 

member about a third axis, said axes being parallel and a line joining 
said first and second axes lying to one side of said third axis in said 

first disposition of said spring and to the other side of said third axis 
in said second disposition. 
A saw as claimed in any preceding claim, in which said spring 
means is neutral in said second disposition
