<ABSTRACT>
A machine tool (10) comprises a headstock (11) and a work table (12) in which a first area is provided as a machining side (14) for first workpieces (17) for machining by means of a tool and in which a second area, as loading side (15), can be loaded with second workpieces (17') preferably during the machining of the first workpieces (17). The two areas (14, 15) are interchangeable by a relative change in position, effected in the direction of a first coordinate (18) of the work table (12), between the headstock (11) and the work table (12), a splash guard (16) being provided between the areas (14, 15). The splash guard (16) extends in the direction of a second coordinate (19) roughly perpendicularly to the first coordinate (18) and is designed to be variable in length at least in sections in the direction of the second coordinate (19).

Machine tool (10; 110), comprising a spindle head (11;
111) and a workpiece table (12; 112), said workpiece table

providing for a first region as a machining side (14; 114)
for first workpieces (17; 117) for being machined by a

tool element, and providing for a second region as a loading
side (15; 115) for being loaded with second workpieces

(17'; 117') preferably while said first workpieces (17;
117) are being machined, said two regions (14, 15; 114,

115) being exchangeable with each other by a relative
positional change between said spindle head (11; 111) and

said workpiece table (12; 112) in the direction of a first
coordinate (18; 118) of said workpiece table (12; 112),

and a spray shielding panel (16; 116; 216) being provided
between said regions (14, 15; 114, 115), said spray

shielding panel extending in the direction of a second
coordinate (19; 119; 219) approximately perpendicular to

said first coordinate (18; 118),

characterized in that

said spray shielding panel (16; 116; 216) is configured
at least in sections with a variable length in the direction

of said second coordinate (19; 119; 219), such that during
machining of a workpiece (17, 117) said splash guard wall

extends over its full length in the direction of said second
coordinate (19; 119; 219) and during a relative positional

change between said workpiece table (12; 112) and said
spindle head (11; 111) takes its position shortened in

the direction of said second coordinate (19; 119; 219), 
wherein at least the variable-length part has been moved

out of the region of the spindle head (11; 111) moving
relativ to said splash guard wall (16; 116; 216).
The machine tool of claim 1, characterized in that the
spray shielding panel (16; 116; 216) is configured to be

at least in sections telescopic in the direction of the

second coordinate (19; 119; 219).
The machine tool of claim 1 or claim 2, characterized in
that the spray shielding panel (16; 116; 216) comprises

a first panel element (21; 121; 221) connected to the
workpiece table (12; 112) as well as a second panel element

(22; 122; 222) that is displaceable with respect to the
first panel element (21; 121; 122) in the direction of

said second coordinate (19; 119; 219).
The machine tool of claim 3, characterized in that said
first panel element (21; 121; 221) is a double panel element

(23; 123; 223) with a clearance inbetween (24; 124; 224)
in which the second panel element (22; 122; 222) can be

displaced.
The machine tool of claim 3 or claim 4, characterized in
that a piston-cylinder arrangement (28; 228) connected

to said second panel element (22; 222) is provided for
displacing the second panel element (22; 222). 
The machine tool according to any of claims 3-5, characterized
in that the first panel element (221) comprises a

lower section (235) extending in the direction of said
second coordinate (212) substantially over the entire depth

of the workpiece table in this direction, said first panel
element (221) comprising thus an L-shape.
The machine tool of any of the preceding claims, characterized
in that said spindle head (11) is displaceable in

the direction of said first coordinate (18) for the purpose
of said relative positional change.
The machine tool of any of claims 1-6, characterized in
that said workpiece table (12) is displaceable in the

direction of said first coordinate (18) for the purpose
of said relative positional change.
The machine tool of any of claims 1-6, characterized in
that the workpiece table (112) can be pivoted in the

direction of said first coordinate (118) for the purpose
of said relative positional change.
