<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to anaerobically-curable sealant
compositions which give flexible products when cured. Such
compositions are particularly useful for forming a seal between two
surfaces such as flanges which are subject to slight movement, for
example as a result of differential heat expansion.Flange sealant materials can be subjected to high temperatures and
solvent environments, particularly in a motor vehicle engine. It is
desirable that the materials maintain their flexibility and integrity
under such conditions and also when they return to normal, ambient
conditions.U.S. Patent 4,985,523 Mochizuki et. al. describes an anaerobically
curing adhesive sealing composition comprising
(A) a methacrylate prepolymer having a urethane structure in the main
chain thereof and having an average molecular weight of 10,000 or
more, and (B) a (meth)acrylate prepolymer having a urethane structure in the
main chain thereof and an average molecular weight of at most 5,000(C) a mono (meth)acrylate monomer represented by the formula (I)

   wherein R1 represents a hydrogen atom or a methyl group; and
R2 represents
Resins having an average molecular weight of 10,000 or more are
not readily available for use as prepolymer (A). Also the monomers (C)
are quite specific.U.S. Patent 4,439,600 Moran describes polymerizable compositions
which form highly flexible rubber-like polymers or elastomers. The
compositions comprise
(A) a moderate-to-long chain di or polyfunctional prepolymer having
vinyl reactive ends, and(B) a mono(meth)acrylate monomer, such as 3-phenoxy-2-hydroxypropyl
methacrylate.All of the prepolymers in the Moran examples were made by reacting
a polyether diol or a polyester diol with an aromatic diisocyanate i.e.
toluene diisocyanate.Tests have shown that while the products of the Moran examples
have high flexibility when cured, this flexibility is lost on ageing at
elevated temperature.U.S. Patent 5,116,558 Wrobel et. al. describes 2-part compositions
for use in forming gaskets by injection. The compositions comprise
(A) a moderate-to-long chain di or polyfunctional prepolymer having
vinyl reactive ends, and(B) a mono (meth)acrylate monomer, such as phenyl substituted alkyl
(meth)acrylates which are particularly preferred, especially
phenyl propyl methacrylate, because the resulting polymers have
better flexibility at high temperatures (up to 150°) than those
made from other monomers.However it has now been found that the degree of flexibility is
relatively low and the materials themselves are
