<ABSTRACT>
A water- and oil-repelling adsorbing film (3) formed on 
a 
substrate surface (1), the adsorbing film being a chemically 
adsorbed film having surface irregularities, the chemically 

adsorbed film being bonded by covalent bonds to the substrate 
surface either directly or indirectly, the chemically adsorbed 

film being a monomolecular or polymer film with the molecules 
thereof containing a fluorocarbon group and a siloxane group, 

and the surface irregularities being due to fine particles 
formed on the substrate surface or due to fine particles 

present in the chemically adsorbed film, wherein the particles 
formed on the substrate surface and fine particles in the 

chemically adsorbed film are hydrophilic particles.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to water- and oil-repelling
adsorbed films which can be used on electric
products, vehicles and industrial apparatus requiring such a
film and a method of manufacturing the same.The invention further relates to water- and oil-repelling,
anti-contaminating glass, ceramic, metal and
plastic products and a method of manufacturing such products.Heat-, weather- and wear-resistant super-thin coating
films are desired for electric products, vehicles, industrial
apparatus, mirrors and glass lenses.Hitherto, coatings which have been extensively used
for water- and oil-repelling purposes, has been produced by
the surface roughening of an Al substrate or the like by means
of blasting, a wire brush or chemical etching, and then
coating a primer followed by a fluorine enamel coating or like
paint. The coatings can be prepared by suspending fine
fluorocarbon base particles of polyethylenetetrafluoride in
ethanol, followed by drying and baking (or fixing) at about 
400 °C for about one hour to affix the fluorocarbon based
polymer to the substrate surface.However, while this method permits ready manufacture,
the polymer is bonded to the substrate by a mere anchor
effect, thus imposing limitations on the adhesion of the
polymer to the substrate. In addition, since the coating film
surface is baked at a high temperature of 400 °C, it is
flattened, and it was impossible to obtain a satisfactorily
water- and oil-repelling surface. The method, therefore, was
insufficient for electric products, vehicles, industrial
apparatus and so forth requiring water- and oil-repelling
coating films.The water- and oil-repelling properties have also been
required for glass, ceramic, metal and plastic products,
typically such glass products as vehicle window glass and
front glass, optical lenses, glass lenses and building window
glass, such ceramic products as sanitary porcelain, table
dishes and flower vases, such construction materials as door
and window sashes, metal materials for building exterior walls
and such plastic products as furniture, cover films,
decoration boards and panels.Further, it has been a sole way of preventing contamination
of the glass, ceramic, metal and plastic products to
make the surface of the products as smooth as possible. It is 
a known practice to coat hydrophilic polymer for preventing
the fogging of the glass surface. However, this provides only
a tentative effect. It is also a known practice to coat a
metal surface with a fluorine resin or the like. This is done
by thinly
