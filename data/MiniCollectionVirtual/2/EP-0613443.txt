<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to the lifting blades of 
helicopters, more specifically to methods for folding 
the blades of the main rotor for purposes of storage. In the prior art, the main rotor blades of 
helicopters are constructed to permit folding of the 
blade about the rotor to decrease the space required 
for storing the aircraft. In addition to 
conservation of storage space, the folded blades 
generally are secured to prevent damage caused by the 
blades striking each other in high winds or other 
conditions that cause movement of the blades. Many of these prior art systems are comprised of 
motors, gears, linkages and control systems that 
automatically fold the main rotor blades of the 
helicopter. United States Patent Nos. 4,376,979, 
4,354,234, 3,749,515, 3,743,441, 3,484,175, and 
3,356,155 all show motorized, fully automated blade 
folding systems. Such systems add a great deal of 
weight to the helicopter, and are difficult to 
maintain and inspect. Other prior art blade folding systems are 
completely manual in operation. United States Patent 
No. 4,712,978 shows one such method and apparatus. 
United States Patent Nos. 4,623,300 and 4,252,504 
show main rotor blade supports and locking member 
systems, respectively, adapted for use in manual 
blade folding systems. In these prior art rotor  
 
blade folding systems, workers are required to move 
the blades manually from the ground using a crutch 
pole or other device. When the locking member is 
released, the blade and rotor structure loses a great 
deal of rigidity. If a person moving the blades 
manually were to drop the blade with the locking 
member released, serious damage to the hinge pin, the 
yoke, or the blade itself is quite possible. To 
avoid such damage, in one prior art technique 
supporting braces are secured to the rotor assembly 
during the folding process. This procedure is time-consuming 
and requires heavy and cumbersome ground 
support equipment. The object of the present invention is to 
provide a simplified method for folding the main 
rotor blades of a helicopter for storage that employs 
a minimum number of additional parts. This object is accomplished by 
a method according to claim 1.  
 FIG. 1 is a perspective view of a helicopter 
with blade supports attached to the nose and tail 
sections of the fuselage and the main rotor blades in 
an unfolded position, illustrating a step of the 
folding method in accordance with the present 
invention. FIG. 2 is another perspective view of the 
helicopter of FIG. 1 showing

<CLAIMS>
A method of folding the main rotor blades (21, 23, 25, 27) for storage of a 
helicopter (11) of a type having a main rotor assembly (29) with a yoke and first second, 

third and fourth blades, each blade foldably attached to the yoke by a means including 
a locking member (51), the helicopter having a fuselage with a nose section (13) located 

before the main rotor assembly and a tail section (17) located aft of the main rotor 
assembly, the method comprising the steps of: 


removably attaching a forward blade support (31) to the nose section (13) 
of the fuselage; 
removably attaching an aft blade support (33) to the tail section (17) of the 
fuselage; 
rotating the main rotor assembly (29) to a position in which the first and 
second blades are in substantially parallel alignment with a longitudinal axis running 

from the forward blade support (31) to the aft blade support (33); then 
placing the first and second blades on the forward (31) and aft (33) blade 
supports, respectively; then 
releasing the locking members (51) to the first and second blades to permit 
the yoke to rotate relative to the first and second blades; then  

 
rotating the main rotor assembly (29) while restraining from rotation the 
first and second blades in the forward (31) and aft (33) blade supports, respectively, to 

a position in which the third and fourth blades are in substantially parallel alignment with 
a longitudinal axis running from the forward blade support (31) to the aft blade support 

(33); and then 
placing the third and fourth blades on the forward and aft blade supports. 
The method according to claim 1 further comprising the steps of lifting the 
first and second blades with the forward (31) and aft blade (33) supports, respectively, 

before releasing the locking members (51). 
The method according to claim 1 or claim 2 wherein the step of placing the 
third and fourth blades on the forward (31) and aft (33) blade supports comprises placing 

the third and fourth blades on portions (37) of the forward (31) and aft (33) blade 
supports that are separate from those portions (35) upon which the first and second 

blades are placed. 
The method according to any of the previous claims wherein the step of 
retraining the first and second blades from rotation in their respective blade supports 

comprising closing a restraining device (35a) around each of the first and second blades.
