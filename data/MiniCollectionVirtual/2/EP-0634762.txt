<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method for producing solid electrolytic capacitors of the kind using conductive macromolecules
as solid electrolyte, and more particularly, to producing a solid
electrolytic capacitor which is encased in synthetic
resin molded casing, hereinafter referred to as the
"casing".In line with the recent trend in which electronic
circuits are digitized and have high frequencies,
capacitors used therefor are required to have
high reliability, small-size, large capacitance and
excellent high frequency characteristics. Solid electrolytic
capacitors, which are inherently small-size
and have large capacitance, have been improved by
using solid electrolytes of newly developed conductive
macromolecules. As a result, they have a high electroconductivity
of conductive macromolecules of about
104 s/m as compared with that of manganese dioxide
(100 s/m or TCNQ salt (102 s/m) and high thermal stability.
The improved solid electrolyte capacitors which are e.g. known from EP-A-0 336 299 have
desirable characteristics such as stable frequency
characteristics of impedance and thermal characteristics
within a wide range.However, it is necessary to reduce inductance
caused by external terminals of the capacitor in accordance
with increases in frequency. It is also 
required to occupy a minimum space on a circuit substrate
in order to reduce the size of the electronic
devices. Furthermore, the consistent reliability of
capacitors are essential so as not to spoil the sophisticate,
long-term electronic devices. Therefore, chip
type elements which are small-size, highly reliable,
and flexible in mounting, that is, can be mounted in a
desired position without occupying a large space; that
is, vertically stacked or horizontally arranged.
Conventional elements are disadvantageous in that
inductance is likely to become large and mounting
flexibility is lacking.Referring to Figures 17 and 18, a conventional
chip type solid electrolytic capacitor will be
described:The solid electrolyte capacitor uses conductive
macromolecules as solid electrolyte. The type
shown in Figure 17(a) is covered with positive electrode
foils, and the type shown in Figure 17(b) is
provided with plain positive electrode foils, and
Figure 18 shows a further type of low chip solid electrolyte
capacitor element. The positive foils are
etched to form an oxide film as dielectric. Then a
conductive macromolecules layer, a graphite layer, and
a silver paint layer are formed on the portion except
the lead line of the positive electrode.
