<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a fuel system for an internal combustion
engine and more particularly to an electronically controllable,
high pressure fuel pump assembly.For well over 75 years the internal combustion engine has been
mankind's primary source of motive power. It would be difficult to
overstate its importance or the engineering effort expended in seeking its
perfection. So mature and well understood is the art of internal
combustion engine design that most so called "new" engine designs are
merely, designs made up of choices among a variety of known alternatives.
For example, an improved output torque curve can easily be achieved by
sacrificing engine fuel economy. Emissions abatement or improved
reliability can also be achieved with an increase in cost. Still other
objectives can be achieved such as increased power and reduced size and/or
sleight but normally at a sacrifice of both fuel efficiency and low cost. An engine's fuel system is the component which often has the
greatest impact on performance and cost. Accordingly, fuel systems for
internal combustion engines have received a significant portion of the total
engineering effort expended to date on the development of the internal
combustion engine. For this reason, today's engine designer has an
extraordinary array of choices and possible permutations of known fuel
system concepts. Design effort typically involves extremely complex and
subtle compromises among cost, size, reliability, performance, ease of
manufacture and backward compatibility with existing engine designs.The challenge to contemporary designers has been significantly
increased by the need to respond to governmentally mandated emissions
abatement standards while maintaining or improving fuel efficiency. In
view of the mature nature of fuel system designs, it is extremely difficult
to extract both improved engine performance and emissions abatement from
further innovations in the fuel system art. Yet the need for such
innovations has never been greater in view of the series of escalating
emissions standards mandated for the future by the United States
government. Meeting these standards, especially those for ignition
compression engines, will require substantial innovations in fuel systems
unless engine manufacturers are prepared to adopt significantly more costly
fuel systems and/or engine redesigns. For example, Cummins Engine
Company, Inc., assignee of the subject application, presently manufactures
a pair of mid-range compression ignition engines identified as the B
