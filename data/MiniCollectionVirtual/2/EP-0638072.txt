<DESCRIPTION>
This application is a continuation-in-part of 
pending U.S. Patent Application Serial No. 07/542,780 
filed June 27, 1990. This invention relates to the use of N,N-disubstituted 
amic acids and/or N,N-disubstituted amic 
acid ammonium salts, their use as surfactants, 
emulsifiers, suspending agents and conditioning agents in 
shampoos. This prior art is replete with emulsions for a 
myriad of uses. Among the numerous applications for 
emulsions are fabric softeners, surface cleaners, 
agricultural chemical mixtures, skin creams and lotions, 
car wax formulations, textile lubricants, and 
antiperspirant formulations. These emulsions are the type wherein a liquid is 
dispersed in at least one insoluble liquid. Such 
emulsions include oil-in-water, water-in-oil, oil-in-water-in-a 
second oil, water-in-oil-in-a second oil, and 
oil-in-a second oil emulsions. These emulsions typically 
include oils such as crude petroleum oil, distilled 
petroleum oil, heavy paraffinic oil, asphaltene oil, 
linseed oil, tall oil, soybean oil alkyd, linseed oil 
alkyd, mineral oil, petrolatum, isopropyl palmitate, 
isopropyl myristate, caprylic/capric triglyceride, 
lanolin, acetylated lanolin alcohol, silicone compounds 
such as dimethicone and cyclomethicone, hydrogenated 
vegetable oil, sesame oil, safflower oil, avocado oil, 
glycerine, propylene glycol, sorbitol, C12-C16 alcohol 
benzoates, cocoa butter, vitamin E acetate, squalene, 
sodium pyrolidone carboxylic acid, methyl glucose ether, 
panthenol, melanin, and mixtures thereof.  
 Exemplary emulsions are shampoo and conditioner 
compositions. The prior art is also replete with shampoo 
and conditioner emulsions. Such emulsions are widely 
used because human hair becomes soiled due to its contact 
with the surrounding atmosphere and, to a greater extent, 
from sebum secreted by the head. The build-up of the 
sebum causes the hair to have a dirty feel and an 
unattractive appearance. The soiling of the hair 
necessitates its being shampooed with frequent 
regularity. Shampooing the hair cleans by removing excess soil 
and sebum. However, the shampooing process is 
disadvantageous because the process results in hair that 
is left in a wet, tangled and generally unmanageable 
state. A variety of approaches have been developed to 
alleviate the after-shampoo problems. These range from 
the inclusion of hair conditioning aids in shampoos to 
post-shampoo application of hair conditioners, i.e., hair 
rinses. Hair rinses typically work by depositing a 
polymeric film or
