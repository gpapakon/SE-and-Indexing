<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to an agent to enhance strength
of keratin fiber which is hereinafter be referred to as a
keratin fiber strengthening agent containing at least one
optically active (2S,3R)-2-acyaminoalkane-1,3-diol and a
method for improving strength of keratin fiber by applying
the keratin fiber strengthening agent to keratin fiber by
adhesion, coating or impregnation.Keratin is a body component such as hair, horn, nail,
scale or feather which covers the outermost part of a body
and is originally derived from the epidermis.
Morphologically, it can be classified into a fibrous type
and amorphous type. The former type is called keratin
fiber and it includes hair, eyebrows and eyelashes and
animal hair such as wool and dog hair.The primary function of keratin is to protect the body
of a higher animal, particularly an animal higher than a
batrachian, from outside attack. Another function of
keratin is to keep the appearance of an individual body
beautiful and this function has a close relation with
retention and improvement of the strength of keratin.
Accordingly, it is important to maintain and reinforce the
strength of keratin or improve the strength of damaged 
keratin.Keratin exists in the outermost part of the body so
that it tends to be exposed to severe attack from the outer
world. Particularly keratin fiber is susceptible to the
outer influence.For example, the physical factors in the natural world
such as friction, rain, dirt, dust or ultraviolet rays and
microbiological factors such as dandruff and bacteria, damages
keratin fiber of hair. In addition, thermal or chemical
irritation due to permanent wave and degreasing due to hair
washing with a solvent or detergent have recently increased
the frequency of hair being damaged.Thermal and chemical irritation of permanent waving or
degreasing caused by washing with a solvent or detergent
decreases the tensional strength of keratin fiber owing to
the damage of protein filament. For example, hair tends to
reduce tensional strength according to the frequency of
permanent waving. It has been reported that the strength
of hair is reduced to about half of the untreated hair at
the tenth treatment.In addition, the hair so damaged and having a reduced
strength loses its gloss. Such a reduction in the strength
produces broken hair or spilt hair, thereby deteriorating
the appearance, which causes a cosmetic problem.It is therefore cosmetically significant to maintain
and increase the strength of keratin fiber and improve the 
strength of damaged keratin
