<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an optical fiber connector
and a method for manufacturing the same.The optical connection between an optical device
such as an optical waveguide component, an optical
semiconductor device (LD array, LED array), etc. and
optical fiber has so far been made by the following
procedure. An optical fiber connector, in which a
plurality of optical fibers are arranged at a
predetermined intervals, is butted against an optical
device, or the optical fiber connector and the
optical device are disposed in opposition to each
other. Then, alignment is performed to align optical
axes between the optical fiber and the optical device.
After that, both elements are bonded by an adhesive
such as a heat curing type or a light (ultraviolet
rays) curing type. Alternatively, an optical fiber
connector and an optical device are opposed to each
other with a predetermined gap between them, optical
axes are aligned between the optical fiber and the
optical device, and then the optical fiber connector
and the optical device are welded to a metal base. As a first example of such a connection between
an optical fiber connector and an optical device,
for example, the connection between an optical fiber
connector and an optical waveguide component is
known.The optical fiber connector has a tape fiber,
in which a plurality of optical fibers are arranged at
predetermined intervals in a coating, and a ferrule.
The ferrule has a butting end face, which is disposed
in opposition to or butted against an optical
waveguide component, and a plurality of fiber holes
formed in parallel at predetermined intervals. One
end of optical fiber is inserted into each of the
fiber holes and bonded, and the optical fiber is
exposed to the butting end face. The most inexpensive
and general method for manufacturing the ferrule is
plastic molding performed by using a mold.The optical waveguide component consists of a
waveguide substrate and a waveguide layer, and
sometimes a cover is bonded onto the waveguide layer.
In the waveguide layer, single or plural waveguides
are formed, and the waveguides are exposed to the
butting end face at both ends. The cover serves to
ensure an effective area for bonding to the optical
fiber connector by making the area and shape of the
butting end face of optical waveguide component
substantially equal to those of the butting end face
of the optical fiber connector.The aforementioned optical fiber connector is
butted against the optical waveguide component through
their butting end faces, and
