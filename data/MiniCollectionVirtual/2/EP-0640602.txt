<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to novel 
benzo[b]furancarboxamide derivatives, stereo-isomers thereof, 
process for the preparation of same, and medicine for improving 
hypermotility of digestive tract, which contains the compound or 
salt as an effective ingredient. Since 4-amino-5-chloro-N-[(2-diethylamino)ethyl]-2-methoxybenzamide 
[General name : Metocloplamide ("The Merck 
Index", 10th Ed. 6063)] had been developed in the 1960s, as an 
agent for improving hypermotility of digestive tract or anti-vomiting 
agent, various benzamide derivatives have been synthesized 
to evaluate pharmacological effect thereof. The main 
object for developing such derivatives lies in moderating a side 
effect of Metoclopramide to central system due to its anti-dopamine 
action, namely extrapyramidal disorder and cryptorrhea 
(lactation and prolactinemia), and recent years, various reports 
have been issued on development of derivatives having antagonism 
to serotonin receptor. A relation between a selective action and 
structure of these benzamide derivatives has not sufficiently 
been elucidated, but it has been recognized that a mutual relation 
between a substituent to amide nitrogen and alkoxy group at 
2-position is important [for instance, Jap. Pat. No. Sho 62 
(A.D. 1987) - 129279(A) and "J. Med. Chem.", Vol. 34, page 616 
(1991)]. Under such a technical notion, carboxamide derivatives 
of benzofuran and benzopyran have been studied, as compounds 
analogous to the benzamide derivatives [Jap. Pat. Nos. Sho 60 
(A.D. 1985) - 169473(A), Sho 62 (A.D. 1987) - 234083(A), Hei 1 
(A.D. 1989) - 104272(A), Hei 1 (A.D. 1989) - 110684(A), Hei 1 
(A.D. 1989) -168686, Hei 1 (A.D. 1989) - 501226(A) and Hei 4 
(A.D. 1992) - 295476(A)]. An object of the present invention is to provide a novel 
compound which has excellent or powerful action to improve hypermotility 
of digestive tract and no or weak side effect to  
 
central system, and thus is excellent in effectiveness and 
safety. The inventors have energetically studied and investigated 
to finally found that certain benzo[b]furancarboxamide derivatives 
are suitable for attaining the object, so that the invention 
was established. The benzo[b]furancarboxamide derivatives are shown by a 
formula of 
   wherein 
Ra, Rb, Rc and Rd are a hydrogen atom or lower alkyl 
group, respectively; Re is a hydrogen atom, amino radical, 
lower alkylamino group or acylamino group; X is a hydrogen 
atom or halogen atom; and n is an integer of 1 - 5. According to a process of the invention,
