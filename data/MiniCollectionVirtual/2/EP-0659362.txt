<ABSTRACT>
A woven slide fastener stringer which includes a 
row of coiled coupling elements (2) woven into one longitudinal 

edge portion (8-1) of a woven stringer tape (8) with a 
stuffer cord (3) and upper and lower core threads (4, 5) 

extending longitudinally through a space defined in the 
coupling elements (2). Foundation warp threads (9) and a 

foundation weft thread (10) laid in double picks cooperate 
with the upper core thread (4) to weave upper legs (11) in 

the longitudinal tape edge portion (8-1). Binding warp 
threads (14) underlying lower legs (12) and interlaced at 

appropriate positions with the foundation weft thread (10), 
and the lower core thread (5) are interlaced with a binding 

weft thread (13) laid in double picks to weave the lower 
legs (12) into the longitudinal tape edge portion (8-1). 

The binding weft thread (13) is thinner than the foundation 
weft thread (10) and aligned in parallel juxtaposition with 

the foundation weft thread (10) in a region of the stringer 
tape excluding the longitudinal tape edge portion (8-1). 

With this arrangement, the coupling elements (2) can be 
firmly and stably secured to the longitudinal tape edge 

portion (8-1), and the stringer has a desired flexibility.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a woven slide
fastener stringer including a row of coiled coupling elements
of synthetic resin woven integrally into a stringer
tape along a longitudinal edge portion thereof.One type of Woven slide fastener stringer is known
in which a row of coiled coupling elements of synthetic
resin woven into a woven stringer tape along one longitudinal
edge thereof, with two core threads and a stuffer cord
received longitudinally in a space defined through the
coiled coupling elements. One of the core threads and one
leg of each coupling element is secured by weaving to one
longitudinal tape edge. The other leg of the coupling
element is firmly secured to the longitudinal tape edge by
a binding thread design which includes a binding weft
thread running between a foundation weft thread located
outside the stuffer cord and the other core thread and
interlaced with binding warp threads disposed between the
foundation weft thread and the stuffer cord, and in which
the other core thread is not underlaid any other thread 
(see, U.S. Patent No. 4,383,558).In the above-mentioned woven slide fastener
stringer having coiled coupling elements, the binding weft
thread in the binding thread design has loops each underlying
the upper and lower core threads in inter-element spaces,
and extending over and across upper leg adjacent to the
coupling head and over lower legs,whereby the upper legs are
sandwiched between the core thread and the binding weft thread.
In making or finishing the woven slide fastener stringer into
a slide fastener chain, a group of the coiled coupling elements
are cut off and then removed from the binding thread
design to form an element-free space portion. The element-free
space portion is relatively thin, however, it results
that the core threads disposed in the coiled coupling elements
adjacent to the upper and lower legs come off and the binding
warp threads float from the binding thread design. When the
slide fastener stringer is finished into a single slide fastener,
the binding warp threads slacken from the tape edge,
thus deteriorating the appearance of the slide fastener. In
addition, when the slide fastener is closed, the slackened
warp threads are likely to be caught between coupling elements,
thereby hindering smooth operation of the slide fastener. To
avoid this difficulty, the slide fastener stringer may be
finished into a slide fastener with a cut portion of the
coupling elements left in a space portion. However, due to 
the presence of the coupling elements,
