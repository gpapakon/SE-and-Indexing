<ABSTRACT>
A load cell for sensing weight and torque on a drill bit during a drilling operation 
includes a cylindrical load cell made from a material with minimum residual stress. A 

plurality of strain gauges are arranged symmetrically on each load cell and electrically 
coupled to form two Wheatstone bridges. The load cells are mounted 180 degrees apart in 

radial pockets drilled in a drill collar wall. A half Wheatstone bridge from one load cell is 
electrically coupled with a half Wheatstone bridge from the other load cell to form a 

Wheatstone bridge for measuring WOB and a similar coupling is made to form another 
Wheatstone bridge for measuring TOB. In another embodiment, additional strain gauges in 

another Wheatstone bridge measure differential pressure. The output of the pressure and 
weight bridges are electrically combined to provide a weight signal unaffected by 

differential pressure fluctuations. The load cells are force fit in the radial pockets in the 
drill collar and a cap is installed on each pocket housing a load cell to protect the load cell 

from drilling fluid. The strain gauges in each load cell are placed to minimize the effects 
of bending, hydrostatic pressure, temperature, differential pressure and cross talk between 

WOB and TOB measurements. The load cells can be replaced easily and drill collar 
gauging is not required. Since the strain gauges are not directly attached to the drill collar, 

the high residual stress in the drill collar does not cause the strain gauges to drift.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to the making of downhole force measurements during the
drilling of a well bore. More particularly, this invention relates to an apparatus for sensing
the amount of weight and/or torque being applied to the drill bit during the drilling
operation.It is well known that the axial load and torque applied to a drill bit during the drilling
of a well are important parameters which affect the direction and inclination of the
borehole as well as the economics of the drilling operation.The axial load on the drill bit is also known as the "weight-on-bit" or "WOB". Weight
is applied to the drill bit by a string of heavy drill collars that are attached immediately
above the drill bit and suspended in the borehole on a smaller diameter drill pipe. In
conventional drilling practice, the entire length of the drill pipe and the upper portion of
the drill collar are suspended at the surface by a derrick in tension so that the amount of
WOB can be adjusted by changing the surface hook load. WOB affects the rate of
penetration, the drill bit wear and the direction of drilling. The torque applied to the drill
bit ("torque-on-bit" or "TOB") is also important with regard to drill bit wear and drilling
direction, particularly when considered together with measurements of WOB. Excessive
TOB is indicative of serious bit damage such as bearing failure and locked cones.In the past, measurements of WOB and TOB were made at the surface by comparing
the "hook load weight" to the "off-bottom weight" of the drill string and by measurement
of the torque applied to the drill string at the surface. It was soon discovered that surface
measurements of WOB and TOB are simply not reliable since other forces acting on the
drill string interfere with surface measurement.More recently, various systems have been devised for taking measurements "down-hole"
and transmitting these measurements to the surface during the drilling of the
borehole. Nevertheless, the down-hole sensors that have been utilized are also subject to
significant inaccuracies due to the effects of well pressure and temperature gradients. 
These systems cannot distinguish between strain due to weight and axial strain due to
pressure differential, the force on the end area of the drill string which urges the drill string
to elongate under internal pressure. They are also adversely affected by the pressure
exerted by drilling fluids.Several attempts have been made to improve the accuracy of down-hole measurements.
One approach, as taught by U.S.
