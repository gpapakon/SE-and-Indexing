<ABSTRACT>
A dielectric probe, of the type in which an electromagnetic wave is reflected from a dielectric/magnetic structure and spectrum analyzed (6), further includes a coil (7) for applying a magnetic field to the structure as the wave is being reflected. Information about the intrinsic electromagnetic properties and structure of the material is obtained by comparing the reflected spectra for both the magnetic field on and off conditions.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to non-destructive test apparatus, and in particular to a
probe for evaluating the intrinsic electromagnetic properties of a dielectric/magnetic
structure.The interaction between an electromagnetic wave and a dielectric/magnetic
structure can be analyzed by reflecting the wave off of the structure and analyzing the
reflected wave. A dielectric probe is essentially a conduit for directing
electromagnetic waves at the surface of the dielectric/magnetic structure and directing 
the reflected waves to an analyzer which analyzes changes in the waveform. The
analysis generally involves measurement of both phase and magnitude of the reflected
wave. Because the amount of energy reflected or absorbed depends on the intrinsic
electromagnetic properties of the structure, the intrinsic properties can be deduced
from the magnitude and phase of the reflected wave. The physical and mathematical
principles involved are well-known to those with a working knowledge of basic
electromagnetic theory, and in particular of antennas which operate according to the
same fundamental principles.Conventional dielectric probes use a variety of conduits for directing the wave
against the material including open-ended waveguides, open resonators, interdigital
dielectrometers, and coaxial cables, all of which are capable of carrying high
frequency waves such as microwaves and/or electromagnetic waves in the VHF/UHF
band. As is well-known, the electric field vectors E and the magnetic field vectors
H of the wave are respectively affected by the permitivity ε of the material and the
permeability µ of material, both of which encompass a polarization component (ε', µ')
and a loss component (ε'', µ''). The respective vector couplings change the relative
magnitude of the E and H vectors, thereby changing both the overall phase and the
magnitude of the wave.Although the theory of electromagnetic wave interaction with a dielectric
and/or magnetic material is in general well-known, the specific contributions of µ and
ε are indistinguishable in the reflected wave by conventional measurement techniques, 
and thus one of the intrinsic properties ε and µ must be known in order to deduce the
other.This is not a problem in the case of a non-magnetic material because the
permeability µ can be assumed to equal the free-space permeability constant.
However, where magnetic effects are significant, another method of measuring µ is
required. Conventional dielectric probes are incapable of measuring the intrinsic
permeability of a
