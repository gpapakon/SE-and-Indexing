<ABSTRACT>
The present invention relates to a helmet, especially a plastic protective helmet for cyclists, and to a method of manufacturing it. To achieve the object of the invention, to provide a plastic helmet which can be produced at a considerably lower manufacturing cost, but with increased resistance to loading, it is proposed to manufacture the helmet in dual-wall (2, 3) construction from blow-moulded plastic. Furthermore, means are to be provided, which bring about a reinforcement of the walls (2, 3) of the helmet (1) relative to one another under compression loading, it being possible for these means to be implemented, preferably, in the form of openings (e.g. 30).

Helmet, in particular a cyclist's
helmet having a shell-like outer wall (2) and an inner

wall (3) and individual apertures (30, 31) which
interconnect the two walls and have walls (34, 35)

which connect the outer wall (2) and inner wall (3) to
one another, the entire helmet shell, comprising the

outer wall (2), inner wall (3) and walls (34, 35),
being integrally formed, characterized in that the

space between the walls (34, 35) of the apertures (30,
31), viewed in cross-section, tapers from the outer

wall (2) to the inner wall (3) over a partial region
of the space between the outer wall (2) and the inner

wall (3), and then widens again towards the inner wall
(3), and additional reinforcing ribs (32, 33), which

do not lie in a line with the apertures (30, 31) and
are formed in the outer (2) and/or inner wall (3), are

provided in the lateral region of the helmet.
Helmet according to Claim 1,
characterized in that the apertures (30, 31) are

formed in elongate manner, and are oriented in the
longitudinal direction of the helmet (1). 
Helmet according to either one of
Claims 1 and 2, characterized in that the apertures

(30, 31) are disposed offset relative to each other
with respect to their longitudinal alignment.
Helmet according to any one of the
preceding claims, characterized in that the outer and

inner walls (2, 3) comprise ribs (32, 33).
Helmet according to any one of the
preceding claims, characterized in that the helmet can

be made from a recyclable material such as
polyethylene, polypropylene copolymer, polystyrene

copolymer, acrylonitrile-butadiene-styrene (ABS),
polyamide or polycarbonate.
Helmet according to any one of the
preceding claims, characterized by a plastics material

which is provided with phosphorogen fluorescent dyes
or colouring pigments.
Helmet according to any one of the
preceding claims, characterized by a plastics material

which is provided with odorous substances.
Helmet according to any one of the
preceding claims, characterized in that one or a 

plurality of air outlet openings (8, 8') are provided
in one of the walls, preferably the outer wall (2).
Helmet according to Claim 8,
characterized in that the air outlet openings (8) have

such a narrow cross-section that it retards the
emergence of air and/or the air outlet openings are

equipped with a valve which likewise retards the
emergence of air.
Helmet according to Claim 9,
characterized in that the valve takes the form of a

flat, resilient blade (9), is mounted on the external
face of the wall in question and covers the respective

opening (8').
Helmet according to any one of the
preceding claims, characterized in that ventilator

wheels (38) are provided in the region of the
apertures (30, 31).
Helmet according to Claim 11,
characterized in that the ventilator wheels (38) are

driven by the head wind or by a solar cell.
Crash helmet, in particular a motor
cyclist's crash helmet, characterized in that the 

crash helmet (50) comprises a helmet (1) according to
at least one of Claims 1 to 12 as the basic member

(53), and the basic member (53) bears on its outer
side an additional helmet shell (51) connected in a

fixed manner.
Method of producing a helmet, in
particular a cyclist's crash helmet according to one

or more of the preceding claims, the helmet being
produced by the blow-moulding process, characterized

in that the helmet is blow-moulded inside a mould (11)
from a plastics tube (13) such that the tube is shaped

in a cavity (12) in the mould (11) to form a double
wall (2, 3, 5) forming the helmet, and partial regions

(22, 23, 24) of the walls (2, 3) are pressed against
one another after the blow-moulding step but before

removal from the mould, such that they are
interconnected, preferably bonded to one another,

there; and in that subsequently the partial regions
(22 - 24) are cut out, so producing apertures (30, 31)

provided with side walls (34, 35).
Method according to Claim 14,
characterized in that by choosing a tube of

corresponding thickness, the thickness of each of the
walls (2, 3) can be set at a desired value.
