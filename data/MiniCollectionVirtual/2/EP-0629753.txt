<ABSTRACT>
The present invention relates to the dismountable anchoring devices for a prestressed cable or the like. The device according to the invention is characterised essentially by the fact that it comprises an anchoring block 2, a seat 3 formed in the anchoring block, the cable 1 being arranged in the seat along an axis 4, a first corner 7 which is able to fit, via one of its faces, against the lateral surface of the cable, a runner 11 mounted so as to be able to slide on a part 12 of the wall of the seat 3 in a plane not parallel to the axis 4 and comprising a part 14 of its lateral wall which is able to cooperate with another face of the corner in order to exert on this corner a force of reaction having at least one component parallel to the axis 4, and a wedge 16 which can be placed in contact between the wall 17 of the runner and a part 18 of the wall of the seat. Application in particular to the construction of large-scale masonry structures such as bridge arches or the like.
