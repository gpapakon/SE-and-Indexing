<ABSTRACT>
In order to coat an essentially toroidal magnet core (1), as edge protection for windings which are to be fitted, the magnet core (1) is surrounded by a shrink sleeve (2) whose ends (3) are pressed after being heated to the shrinkage temperature, by means of suitable tools (5, 6) into the internal opening (4) in the magnet core, so that coating, which is adequate for edge protection, is produced with only a small increase in volume, even in the case of small magnet cores.

Method for coating an essentially cylindrical 
magnet core (1) with an inner opening for achieving an 

effective edge protector, in particular for toroidal 
strip-wound cores with sharp edges, by using a shrink-on 

sleeve (2) which is drawn over the outer circumference of 
the magnet core (1) and whose length projects beyond the 

length of the magnet core (1) at both ends in the axial 
direction, characterized in that bonded onto the end 

faces of the magnet core are aperture discs (7) whose 
aperture diameters are smaller than the diameter of the 

inner opening of the magnet core, and in that these 
aperture discs are shrunk around by the shrink-on sleeve 

while being heated, and their ends are pressed a little 
into the inner opening (4) of the magnet core (1) and 

held therein. 
Method according to Claim 1, characterized in 
that essentially conical tools (5) press the edges of the 

apertures in the aperture discs (7) in the heated state 
into the inner opening (4) of the magnet core (1), with 

the result that after cooling they are fixed in this 
form. 
Method according to Claim 1, characterized in 
that the edges of the apertures in the aperture discs (7) 

are pressed into the inner opening (4) of the magnet core 
(1) during winding of the core with electrically conducting 

turns and are held therein by the electric turns (8).
