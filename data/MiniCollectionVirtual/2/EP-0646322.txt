<ABSTRACT>
The present invention relates to improvement of breeding 
efficiency of sows. 
The present invention povides an additive for the feed 
of sows containing as an active ingredient a reduced form of 

folic acid in the form of 7,8-dihydrofolic acid, leucovorin, 
liver powder, disrupted cells or cell extract of a 

microorganism, etc.; a feed for sows added with such as 
additive; and a method of breeding sows in which sows are 

orally administered with such an additive or fed with such a 
feed.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method for the preparation of a feed for sows.Folic acid is a coenzyme participating in the synthesis of amino acids, such as methionine, serine and glutamic acid, and purine bases of nucleic acids constituting DNAs. It has been confirmed by epidemiological surveys on pregnant women and tests on pregnant guinea pigs that the demand for folic acid increases and its concentration in blood plasma decreases in mother's bodies during pregnancy [Pritchard J. A. et al., Am. J. Obst. Gynecol., Vol. 104, p. 388 (1969) and Habibzadeh H. C. et al., Br. J. Nutr., Vol. 55, p.23 (1986)].It has also been confirmed with regard to pigs, the domestic animal, that the amount of reduced form of folic acids in blood plasma of sows decreases during pregnancy [Natsuhori et al., Final Program and Abstracts Book of the 10th International Symposium: "Chemistry and Biology of Pteridines and Flates," p.196 (1993)]. It has also been proved that breeding efficiency can be improved by administering folic acid (an oxidized form) to pregnant pigs by means of intramuscular injection [Matte J. J. et al., J. Anim. Sci., Vol. 67 p. 426 (1989) and Friendship R. M. et al., Can Vet. J., Vol. 32, p.564 (1991)], which shows the importance of administering folic acids to pregnant pigs (sows).However, administering the folic acid to sows by intramolecular injection is practically troublesome, and it is highly preferred if the effect of improving breeding efficiency expresses when the folic acid are administered by means of addition to feed (oral administration). A number of investigations have already been made on the improvement of breeding efficiency based on oral administration. However, some consider the administration effective [Thaler R. C. et al., J. Anim. Sci., Vol. 67, p. 3,360 (1989), Lindemann M. D. et al., J. Anim. Sci., Vol. 67, p. 459 (1989) and Lindemann M. D. et al., J. Anim. Sci., Vol. 71, p. 239 (1991)], and others are skeptical about its effects [Easter R. A. et al., Nutrition Reports International, Vol. 28, p. 945 (1983) and Matte J. J. et al., Livestock Production Science, Vol. 33, p. 131 (1992)]. There is no clear conclusion on the effects of oral administration of an oxidized form of folic acid.In general, folic acid is chemically synthesized. Chemically synthesized folic acid is of the oxidized form, and the oxidized form of folic acid per se does not function as a coenzyme. Usually, after being absorbed into the body, it is transferred by dihydrofolic acid dehydrogenase into

<CLAIMS>
A method for the preparation of a feed for sows comprising a feed additive comprising as an active ingredient for improving the efficiency of breeding a reduced form of folic acid or an active derivative thereof in an amount which gives an intake of 0.1 to 100 Âµg (as reduced form of folic acid) per kg of body weight of a sow per day, wherein said reduced form of folic acid is in the form of disrupted cells or cell extract of a microorganism, wherein said method comprises cultivating the cells in a medium added with p-aminobenzoic acid, an oxidized form of folic acid, and/or a nucleic acid in an amount of 1 mg/l to 1 g/l and obtaining said disrupted cells or cell extract.
