<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates generally to roller
skates, and more, particularly, to skates for skating in a
manner similar to inline skating, but wherein separate sets
or groups of wheels are positioned on respective sides of
the skate and/or on respective sides of a central support
member.Inline roller skating has now become a popular
recreational activity. in response to this, a growing
commercial market for such skates has developed in the
United States and elsewhere.The term "inline skating" is derived from the
arrangement of the skate's wheels. According to the inline
arrangement, the wheels of the skate are arranged
longitudinally one behind the other or in tandem so that the
wheels rotate in the same longitudinally oriented vertical
plane, similar to ice skating where there is a blade all in
one plane. Further, the axles of each wheel are generally
oriented in the same horizontal plane. This alignment
results in an arrangement of wheels approximating the
footprint of the blade of an ice skate.DE-A-2446210 discloses an inline roller skate obtained
by conversion of an ice skate. The skate comprises an
elongate support carrying two vertical flanges. Wheels may
be attached either between or on either side of these
flanges.It is recognized in the industry that by arranging the
wheels of the roller skate in the same vertical plane,
resistance to turning the skate is minimised. This
arrangement, however, provides little or no latitudinal
support for the skate. As a consequence of this lack of
support, a great deal of 
stress is placed on the skater's lower leg, particularly the
skater's ankle. The industry has responded to this problem
by producing inline skates with rigid plastic boots that
provide support for the user's ankle. To be effective, these
boots must rise at least above the user's ankle, but many of
the boots in use rise approximately halfway up the user's
calf.Although adoption of the plastic boot by the inline
skating industry has reduced the stability problems
associated with inline skates, it has created another set of
problems. First, plastic boots generally do not breathe,
that is, they do not allow for the transfer of perspiration
out and away from the user's foot during use. Secondly, the
rigid plastic boots often do not confirm as well to the shape
of the user's foot as boots fabricated from more pliable
materials, such as leather. And, thirdly, because of the
bulkiness of the plastic boots required, the boots are
heavier and less aerodynamically designed than those
fabricated from

<CLAIMS>
A roller skate (10) to be worn on the feet of a user,
the roller skate comprising:


(a) mounting means (28) for attachment to the foot
of a user having an inside (38) and an outside (36),

respectively, corresponding to the inside and the outside of
the respective user's foot on which the skate (10) is

designed to be worn;
(b) a first group (34) of wheels (18) generally in
longitudinal alignment with the roller skate (10) and

generally in rotatable alignment with each other; and
(c) a second group (40) of wheels (22) generally in
longitudinal alignment with the roller skate (10) and

generally in rotatable alignment with each other;

   said first group (34) of wheels (18) being rotatably
attached to said mounting means (28) and disposed to the

outside (36) thereof, said second group (40) of wheels (22)
being rotatably attached to said mounting means (28) and

disposed to the inside (38) thereof, 
characterised in that

a first span between a foremost wheel and a hindmost wheel
of the first group (34) of wheels (18) is less than a second

span between a foremost wheel and a hindmost wheel of the
second group (40) of wheels (22).
A roller skate according to claim 1, further
comprising foot support means arranged to fit the feet of

the user and having the mounting means connected thereto,
said foot support means having a first side disposed to the

outside of said mounting means and a second side disposed to
the inside of said mounting means.
A roller skate according to claim 2, wherein the said
foot support means is a shoe.
A roller skate according to any one of claims 1 to 3,
wherein the mounting means is a central support beam

extending in longitudinal alignment with the foot support 
means.
A roller skate according to claim 4, wherein said first
group of wheels is rotatably interconnected to said central

support beam and disposed to the first side thereof, said
second group of wheels being rotatably interconnected to said

central support beam and disposed to a second side thereof,
wherein the respective first and second groups of wheels are

disposed to opposite sides of said central support beam.
A roller skate according to any one of claims 1 to 5,
further comprising brake means for slowing and stopping the

roller skate when a user desires.
A roller skate according to any one of claims 1 to 6,
wherein the number of wheels disposed on the inside of each

skate is greater than the number of wheels disposed on the
outside of each skate.
A roller skate according to claim 7, wherein two wheels
are disposed on the outside of the skate and three wheels are

disposed on the inside of the skate.
A roller skate according to claim 8, wherein the three
wheels disposed on the inside of the skate include first,

second and third wheels which are aligned in numerical order,
the individua
l wheels of the group of two wheels disposed on
the outside of the skate being individually staggered

latitudinally between the first and second wheels and the
second and third wheels, respectively.
