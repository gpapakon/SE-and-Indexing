<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a stacking device for plate-like goods (plates), especially sheet-metal plates, with a transport device, on the transport surface of which the plates rest in succession in a successive arrangement spaced relative to another and are fed to a stack-depositing point. Provision is made for the transport device (11) to have an oscillating switch (21) for allocating the plates (10), and for the feed of the plates (10) to at least two stack-depositing points (stacking box 1, stacking box 2) to take place, downstream of the switch (21), by means of feed devices (25,26), the plate-transport speed of which is reduced in relation to the plate-transport speed of a feed device (20) preceding the switch (21) belonging to the transport device (11).
