<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to water dispersible 
granules for agricultural use. More particularly, 
the invention relates to water dispersible granules 
that carry biologically active substances, in liquid 
form, including pesticides, optionally in combination with adjuvants 
which enable the active substances to be delivered to 
target species. Biologically active substances for the 
control of weeds, insects, fungi and other pests are 
extensively used and are generically referred to as 
pesticides. They may also include beneficial agents 
such as plant growth regulators. When the active 
substances are in a liquid state at ambient 
temperatures they have been formulated in a number 
of ways that, to varying extents, are adapted for 
ease of transport, handling and application. It is 
generally desirable with these various formulations  
 
that the active substance be delivered in the form 
of an aqueous spray. Examples of types of 
formulations that may be applied in this manner are 
emulsifiable concentrates (EC), wettable powders 
(WP), suspension concentrates (SC) and water 
dispersible granules (WG). EC, WP and SC 
formulations have disadvantages either during 
manufacture, transport, storage or use. Limitations 
of EC formulations include the dangers in packaging, 
storing and handling highly flammable solvents. WP 
formulations can present handling problems with the 
nuisance and potential health hazard of dust to the 
user. SC formulations can have storage problems and 
are difficult to clean up after spillage. WG formulations offer significant advantages 
in packaging, ease of handling and safety. 
Typically these consist of small granules of 0.1 - 3 
mm in diameter and preferably of uniform size and 
which are free flowing, low dusting and readily 
disperse in water to form an homogenous suspension 
of very small particles which may pass through 
conventional spray nozzles. Ideally WG formulations 
when dispersed in water under gentle agitation for 
five minutes have residues of less than 0.01% on a 
150 µm sieve screen and less than 0.5% on a 53 µm 
screen. The granules can usually be measured 
accurately by volume which is convenient for the end 
user. Generally, WG comprise a biologically active 
substance, a filler (also referred to as diluent), 
surface active agents (which term may include 
dispersants and wetting agents) and auxiliary agents 
such as binders, stabilisers and buffering agents. 
The amounts of individual ingredients may vary 
widely, with the biologically active substance

<CLAIMS>
A method for preparing water dispersible granules by 
preparing an absorbent water dispersible granule from finely 

divided filler particles and a dispersing agent and then 
absorbing a liquid biologically active substance, optionally 

in combination with an adjuvant therefor, into said absorbent 
granule. 
A method for preparing water dispersible granules as 
defined in claim 1 wherein the biologically active substance 

and, optionally, the adjuvant therefor are in the form that is 
miscible with water. 
A method for preparing water dispersible granules as 
defined in either claim 1 or claim 2 wherein the biologically 

active substance is a liquid at less than 50°C. 
A method for preparing water dispersible granules as 
defined in claim 1 wherein the biologically active substance 

has a water solubility of less than 20 g/litre. 
A method for preparing water dispersible granules as 
defined in claim 1 wherein the finely divided fillers are 

water insoluble and have a particle size less than 50 µm. 
A method for preparing water dispersible granules as 
defined in claim 5 wherein at least a portion of the fillers 

are plate-like in shape. 
A method for preparing water dispersible granules as 
defined in claim 1 wherein a portion of the filler is selected 

from heat processed expanded perlite, talc and muscovite mica.  
 
A method for preparing water dispersible granules as 
defined in claim 1 wherein the granules are formed by a low 

pressure extrusion process followed by gentle rolling or 
tumbling action. 
A method for preparing water dispersible granules as 
defined in any one of claims 1 to 8 wherein the quantity of 

biologically active substance and, optionally, adjuvant therefor 
that is absorbed into the absorbent granule is chosen such 

that 60-90 % of the absorptive capacity of the absorbent 
granules is attained. 
A method for preparing water dispersible granules as 
defined in any one of claims 1 to 9 wherein the active substance 

is selected from the group consisting of fluazifop-P-butyl, 
lambda-cyhalothrin and propargite. 
A method for preparing water dispersible granules by 
preparing an absorbent water dispersible granule from finely 

divided filler particles and a dispersing agent and then 
absorbing a liquid surface active substance or an emulsifier 

into said absorbent granule.
