<ABSTRACT>
A computerized tomography apparatus is disclosed 
which reconstructs a tomography image of data from 

multi-directional projection data in a period of time 
less than the time required for a scan operation for 

data acquisition and displays the tomography image after 
a lapse of a given period of time from the termination 

of the scan operation. This avoids the time interval 
between scan and image display becoming irregular. 

Accordingly, tomography images can be displayed successively 
like motion picture to observe the internal 

movements of a section of a human body under examination 
in real time.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a computerized
tomography apparatus. More specifically, the present
invention relates to a computerized tomography apparatus
which permits continuous scanning.In general, a computerized tomography (CT)
apparatus performs three processes of scanning, image
reconstruction and image display in time sequence.
Projection data acquired from many directions while an
X-ray tube rotates or the X-ray tube and a detector
array rotate together is digitized, then subjected to
preprocessing such as calibration and temporarily stored
as raw data on large-volume storage such as magnetic
disk storage.At the time of image reconstruction, the raw data
is read out of the magnetic disk storage, then fed into
a reconstruction unit via a memory. Tomography image
data reconstructed in the reconstruction unit is stored
on magnetic disk storage and transferred as a video
signal to a cathode ray tube (CRT) monitor via a display
memory.The introduction of slip rings has enabled a
continuous scan to be made. This continuous scan
permits multi-directional projection data for a single
slice or multiple slices to be obtained in time
sequence. The multi-direction projection data is read
from the magnetic disk storage into the reconstruction 
unit at arbitrary timing, then used for image
reconstruction as described above. The time required
for the image reconstruction is longer than the scanning
time, and the time it takes to write on and make access
to the magnetic disk storage is long. It is therefore
impossible to display tomography images successively in
real time like motion pictures while making a continuous
scan.The high-speed processing of image reconstruction
was considered in recent years and is reaching the stage
of practical use. Thus, the CT apparatus has been
expected to display successively tomography images in
real time while making a continuous scan. However, the
long storage and access times of magnetic disk storage
are a serious obstacle to practical use of the high-speed
processing of image reconstruction. Further, the
wait state occurs irregularly in writing on and making
access to magnetic disk storage. Thus, the time interval
between a scan and the display of a tomography image
varies irregularly, making it impossible to reproduce
the internal movements of a section of a human body
under examination.Besides, the following problems arise in connection
with the use of real-time X-ray CT apparatus in a clinical
field. The first problem is that it takes a long
time for an operator to
