<ABSTRACT>
Thermos bottle (1) comprising an inner insulating bottle (3) 
held in a main body case (2), said thermos bottle comprising a 

feeding port (4) through which liquid may enter or leave the inner 
bottle. A feeding port plug (5), comprising a liquid receiving 

input port (10) at the one side communicating through a 
communication chamber (11) with a liquid feeding pipe (12) at the 

other side, is installed in said feeding port, such that the liquid 
feeding pipe extends inside the inner bottle. The length of said 

feeding pipe is selected such that the free end of said pipe 
reaches almost to near the bottom of the inner bottle.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a thermos bottle comprising an inner 
insulating bottle held in a main body case, said thermos bottle 
comprising a feeding port through which liquid may enter or leave 
the inner bottle, a feeding port plug, being installed in said feeding port, said feeding port 
plug comprising a liquid communication chamber extending between a liquid receiving input 
port and the interior of the bottle, Such a thermos bottle is known from document US-A-4 386 556.  
 Thermos bottles of the above-identified type are known in 
various different embodiments and are used for storing hot liquids, 
such as coffee, tea, or the like, or for storing cooled liquids, 
such as ice water, ice tea, etc. In a variety of thermos bottles the feeding port for feeding 
liquid is closed by a stopper plug which has to be removed for 
feeding liquid through the feeding port into the inner bottle. In 
other embodiments the stopper plug is provided with a feeding 
passage and in that case the stopper plug does not have to be 
removed to feed liquid into the inner bottle because, for that 
purpose, said feeding passage can be used. Generally known are thermos bottles comprising a lid with a 
built in pump mechanism for injecting air into the bottle and 
comprising a feeding port stopper plug containing a passage 
connected to a riser pipe extending from said passage to near the 
bottom of the bottle. A problem with such thermos bottles is, that 
the plug with the thereto connected riser pipe has to be removed 
each time the thermos bottle is refilled with fresh extracted 
liquid. A first object of the invention is now to provide a thermos 
bottle embodied such that it is not necessary to remove the feeding 
port stopper plug with the thereto attached further components to 
be able to fill the bottle with liquid. If the thermos bottle is used in cooperation with an 
apparatus for preparing hot drinks by extraction, such as coffee or 
tea, the bottle is positioned underneath the filter unit of said 
apparatus to directly receive the extract liquid dripping out of 
said filter unit. However, since the concentration of the extract 
differs between the beginning and the end of the extraction process 
the liquid sequentially collected in the inner bottle will show a 
concentration gradient, the liquid with stronger concentration 
being present near the bottom of the bottle and the concentration  
 
decreasing in upwards direction. Hence, it requires stirring or the 
like to eliminate this concentration gradient. It is now
