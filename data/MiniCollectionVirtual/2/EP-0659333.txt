<ABSTRACT>
The present invention relates to an agricultural machine for the distribution of products intended for feeding cattle or for straw bedding (mulching), including in particular a receptacle (1) with two sidewalls (3 and 4), a mechanism (25) for shifting the products which is located in the bottom of the receptacle (1), and a device (5) for shredding and distributing the products which is placed in a casing (6) situated at one end of the said receptacle (1) and has a large opening (10) pointing towards this receptacle (1) and a side opening (49) for the ejection of the products, which shredding and distributing device (5) consists of a rotary disc (27) fitted with ejector blades (30, 31). It is noteworthy in that the shredding and distributing device (5) has, on the side pointing towards the receptacle (1), a means (35) for regulating the amount of products arriving at the disc (27) and at the ejector blades (30, 31), which means (35) consists of at least one ring (36, 37) which is concentric with the disc (27) and has at least one central opening (41, 42) via which products to be distributed pass and which is situated at a certain distance from the said disc (27), above the mechanism (25) for shifting the products.

Agricultural machine for distributing products intended for feeding livestock
or for straw spreading, comprising a receptacle (1) with two side walls (3 and

4), a mechanism (25) for conveying the products which is arranged in the
bottom of the receptacle (1) and a device (5) for shredding and distributing

the products which is placed in a casing (6) located at one end of the said
receptacle (1) and has a wide opening (10) directed towards this receptacle

(1) and a side opening (49) for ejecting the products, which shredding and
distributing device (5) consists of a rotary disc (27) equipped with ejection

blades (30, 31) and has, on the side facing the receptacle (1), a means (35) of
regulating the amount of product reaching the disc (27) and the ejection

blades (30, 31), 
characterized in
 that the regulating means (35) consists of at
least one ring (36, 37) concentric with the disc (27) and located a certain

distance from the disc (27) above the mechanism (25) for conveying the
products, which ring (36, 37) has an approximately cylindrical wall (39, 40)

of small thickness with at least one central opening (41, 42) through which
some of the products that are to be distributed pass.
Machine according to Claim 1, 
characterized in
 that the regulating means
(35) comprises two rings (36 and 37) which have different diameters and

which are located at different distances from the disc (27), the ring (36)
which has the smaller diameter being further from the disc (27) than the

other ring (37).
Machine according to Claim 2, 
characterized in
 that each of the rings (36,
37) consists of a thin wall (39, 40).
Machine according to any one of the preceding claims, 
characterized in
 that
the rings (36 and 37) are fixed on bars (38) secured to the disc (27). 
Machine according to Claim 4, 
characterized in
 that the bars (38) have parts
which are inclined between the two rings (36 and 37) and bear knives (44).
Machine according to any one of the preceding claims, 
characterized in
 that
each ring (36, 37) is fitted with knives (43).
Machine according to Claim 2, 
characterized in
 that the ring (37) with the
larger diameter is located near to the conveying member (25).
Machine according to Claim 1 or 7, 
characterized in
 that the mechanism
(25) for conveying the products consists of a rubber belt with transverse bars

(26), which is given a forward motion.
Machine according to any one of the preceding claims, 
characterized in
 that
it comprises a fixed retaining member (46) located above the regulating

means (35).
Machine according to Claim 9, 
characterized in
 that the retaining member
(46) comprises knives (47) directed towards the regulating means (35).
Machine according to any one of the preceding claims, 
characterized in
 that
at least the side wall (3) which is on the side on which the shredding and

distributing device (5) travels downwards as it rotates bears a screen (48)
which extends towards the regulating means (35).
Machine according to Claim 11, 
characterized in
 that the screen (48) extends
downwards as far as near to the conveying mechanism (25). 
Machine according to Claim 11, 
characterized in
 that the screen (48) extends
upwards at least as far as a horizontal plane (P) passing through the middle of

the shredding and distributing device (5).
Machine according to any one of the preceding claims, 
characterized in
 that
it comprises an apron (51) which is located in front of the opening (10) in the

casing (6), in the upper part of the space between the regulating means (35)
and the side wall (4) which is on the side on which the shredding and

distributing device (5) travels upwards as it rotates.
Machine according to Claim 14, 
characterized in
 that the apron (51) is made
of flexible rubber.
Machine according to Claim 14 or 15, 
characterized in
 that the apron (51) is
