<ABSTRACT>
A liquid crystal device is constituted by a 
pair of substrates, and a chiral smectic liquid 

crystal assuming at least two stable states disposed 
between the two substrates. At least one of the 

substrates is subjected to a uniaxial aligning 
treatment in two directions including a normal 

direction and a reverse direction substantially 
opposite to the normal direction. The liquid crystal 

is placed in an alignment state such that the liquid 
crystal provides an apparent tilt angle ϑa which is a 

half of an angle between said two stable states, a 
tilt angle H ○ and a pretilt angle α with respect to a 

substrate surface, and forms smectic layers forming an 
inclination angle δ from a normal to the substrate 

surfaces, satisfying: 

H
/2 
<
 ϑa ≦ 
H
 
 and 


H

. 

According to the liquid crystal device, an undesirable 
liquid crystal molecular movement along the substrates 

is effectively suppressed.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a liquid 
crystal device filled with a chiral smectic liquid 
crystal and used, e.g., in terminal displays of 
computers, word processors and typewriters, television 
receivers, view finders for video cameras, and light 
valves for projectors and liquid crystal printers. 
The present invention further relates to a liquid 
crystal apparatus equipped with such a liquid crystal 
device. A liquid crystal device of the type which 
controls transmission of light in combination with a 
polarizing device by utilizing the refractive index 
anisotropy of ferroelectric liquid crystal molecules 
has been proposed by Clark and Lagerwall (U.S. Patent 
No. 4,367,924, etc.). The ferroelectric liquid 
crystal has generally chiral smectic C phase (SmC*) or 
H phase (SmH*) and, under this state, shows a property 
of taking either one of a first optically stable state 
and a second optically stable state responding to an 
electrical field applied thereto and maintaining such 
a state in the absence of an electrical field, namely 
bistability, and also has a rapid response to the 
change in electrical field. Thus, it is expected to 
be utilized in a high speed and memory type display  
 
device and particularly to provide a large-area, high-resolution 
display. With respect to a liquid crystal device using 
such a ferroelectric liquid crystal, it has been 
hitherto desired to develop a technique of 
appropriately controlling the alignment state of the 
liquid crystal to obtain a homogenous alignment state 
thereof, thereby improving display characteristics, 
such as contrast. Further, in such a liquid crystal device, 
there have been posed several problems in addition to 
the alignment technique. One of such problems is 
occurrence of local coloring or tinging of a display 
device (generally along a side region thereof) during 
the drive of the device. The phenomenon is described 
with reference to Figure 1A (a plan view of a 
ferroelectric liquid crystal device) and Figure 1B (an 
illustration of liquid crystal molecular behavior in 
the device). More specifically, when such a device is 
continually driven for a long period, a side or edge 
region 13 of the display area is colored or tinged in 
yellow. Such a phenomenon not only deteriorates the 
appearance of the picture but also can change the 
switching characteristics of the related liquid 
crystal pixels. It has been found that such a 
phenomenon has been caused by movement of liquid  
 
crystal molecules toward the region 13 to
