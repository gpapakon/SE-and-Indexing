<ABSTRACT>
In a field effect transistor and a production method 
thereof, a p-type layer (19) is provided at a region at 

source side so as not to accumulate positive holes which 
have flown to the source side to a high concentration. By 

surrounding the source side region by the p-type layer (19) 
and making positive holes stray to the ground through a high 

concentration p-type layer (18), it can be avoided that the 
positive holes generated at the drain side region and 

accumulated to the source side region weaken the electric 
field in a substrate (4) at the source side as well as the 

high concentration positive hole region (16) extends out to 
the drain side thereby to strengthen the electric field at 

the drain end region at the drain side as in the prior art, 
whereby the improvement in the drain breakdown voltage is 

enabled.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a field effect 
transistor and a production method therefor, and more 
particularly, to the improvement of the source to drain 
breakdown voltage of a compound semiconductor field effect 
transistor. Figure 4 is a cross-sectional view illustrating a 
structure of a prior art refractory metal gate field effect 
transistor. In the figure, reference numeral 4 designates a 
semi-insulating intrinsic layer or p-type layer of a 
compound semiconductor substrate comprising, for example, 
GaAs or the like. An n-type active layer 2 serving as 
channel is produced at the surface region of the compound 
semiconductor substrate 4 by implanting n-type impurity, for 
example, Si or the like into the surface region of the 
compound semiconductor substrate 4. A refractory metal gate 
comprising WSi or the like is produced on the n-type active 
layer 2 serving as a channel. High concentration n-type 
layers 3a and 3b which are to become a source and a drain 
regions, respectively, are produced at the n-type active 
layer 2 serving as channel by impurity plantation at the 
both sides of the gate electrode 1. A source electrode 6 
and a drain electrode 5 are disposed on the high  
 
concentration n-type source and drain layer 4, respectively. 
In the figure, reference character A designates a region of 
high electric field produced at a region in the channel in 
vicinity of the drain region end between the gate and the 
drain region, and in this high electric field region 
collision ionization, which will be discussed later, occurs. A description is given with reference to figure 5 as to 
how the drain breakdown voltage, i.e., the voltage at which 
breakdown occurs in a state where a large current is flowing 
between the source electrode 6 and the drain electrode 5 is 
determined, in the above-described compound semiconductor 
field effect transistor. In figure 5(a), (b), and (c), reference numeral 1 
designates a refractory metal gate, reference numeral 2 
designates an n-type channel layer, reference numerals 3a 
and 3b designate respectively a source and a drain high 
concentration n-type layers, reference numeral 7 designates 
a depletion layer below the gate produced in the channel 
layer 2, reference numeral 8 designates a flow of an 
electron from the source region 3a to the drain region 3b in 
the below-gate depletion layer 7, and reference numeral 9 
designates a high electric field region in the channel 2 
between the gate and the drain where collision ionization 
occurs at an
