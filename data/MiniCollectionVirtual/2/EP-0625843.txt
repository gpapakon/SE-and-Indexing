<ABSTRACT>
A laser imaging apparatus (10) includes a 
laser diode (16) which is controlled to 

produce a laser beam the power of which varies linearly 
as a function of a digital image input signal (12). 

The digital image input signal has a first range of digital values which 
would operate the laser diode in the linear region and lower ranges of 

digital values below the first range of values which would operate the 
laser diode in the nonlinear region. The laser beam is deflected by 

scanning optics to expose photosensitive media such as film. The control 
device (14) includes comparator for comparing the value of the digital 

image input signal to first and second predetermined transition values, 
which delineate, repsectively, the first and the second ranges of values 

and the second and the third ranges of values, such that, the laser 
diode is controlled to operate in the amplitude modulation (AM) mode and 

pulse amplitude modulation (PAM) or pulse width modulation (PWM) modes. 
When the digital image signal is in a first range of values to operate 

the laser diode in its linear region, the laser diode is controlled to 
operate in an AM mode. W
hen the digital image signal is in a second, 
lower range of values which would operate the laser diode in its 

non-linear region, the laser diode is controlled to operate in the 
linear region but in a PAM mode. When the digital image signal is in a 

third, lower range of values which would operate the laser diode in its 
non-linear region, the laser diode is controlled to operate in the 

linear region but in a PWM mode.

<DESCRIPTION>
In general, the present invention relates to 
laser imaging apparatus such as laser printer 
apparatus. More particularly, the present invention 
relates to laser diode printer apparatus wherein the 
exposure characteristics of a laser diode are optimized 
so that the maximum range of exposure (Emax -Emin) is 
obtained without the use of the light emitting diode 
(LED) region of the laser diode. A laser diode operates in two distinct 
regions which includes a laser region and a LED region. 
As shown in FIG. 1, the laser region is characterized 
by a linear relationship between the laser diode drive 
current above a threshold current, and the output 
illuminative power. In the LED region, the 
relationship between the drive current and the output 
illuminative power is non-linear, and the change in 
output illuminative power is very small for a change in 
current, relative to the laser region of operation. A 
means of using laser diodes for exposure in laser 
printers, is to drive the laser diode with a digital to 
analog converter (DAC) which equally divides the 
current into 2N-1 values, where N equals the number of 
bits input to the DAC. Because the laser diode 
efficiency (which is measured as milliwatts output 
power, per unit milliamp of input current) is very 
small in the LED region, a large range of input signal 
code values results in very little change in exposure. One type of laser printer uses an n bit (for 
example, 12 bit) DAC which drives an exposure device (a 
He-Ne gas laser and acoustooptic modulator or laser 
diode). The exposure device then prints exposures upon 
photosensitive media such as film. An output lookup 
table is constructed, through which the data is mapped 
prior to digital to analog conversion. The lookup  
 
table is calculated to force a linear mapping from code 
value to film density. In the high density region of the Density vs. 
Log Exposure (DLogE) film curve, the delta exposure for 
a constant delta density is much greater than in the 
low density region. As a result, the output lookup 
table maps a number of input code values to a single 
output code value in the high density or high exposure 
region. This results in an inefficient use of code 
values for exposure. It is known that the threshold of visibility 
for a small change in luminance is relatively constant 
in the luminance region over which radiographs are 
viewed (see M.I. Sezan, K. Yip, S.J. Daly, "Uniform 
Perceptual Quantization: Applications to Digital 
Radiography," IEEE Transactions on Systems,
