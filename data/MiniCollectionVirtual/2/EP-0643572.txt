<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a zero-loss,
multi-pressure, air support system, in the form of a
mattress assembly.It is well known in medical circles that low
pressure air support systems are rated very highly in
providing pressure relief to patients and elderly people
who are at risk in developing pressure sores
particularly, when confined to a bed for a long period of
time.There are various air support systems known
including low loss air support systems, alternating
pressure systems and static inflatable devices. There is
particularly known a support apparatus comprising a frame
with support members being mounted on such frame and a
plurality of inflatable air sacs mounted on and
operatively connected to such support members. Such beds
usually have a low pressure air supply connected thereto,
the pressure normally utilised being of the order of
25 mm Hg. The air sacs or air chambers are almost
airtight but permit leakage at a planned rate from holes
or stitch holes and the sacs may be linked together to
form common pressure zones. Such arrangement enables
differing pressures to be applied to the differing groups
of air sacs or chambers so as to provide a patient with a
comfortable support system. Moreover, the frame is in
the form of sections, the angles of which may be adjusted
to assist in the comfort of the patient. Whilst such air support systems are well known and
utilised in medical circles, the provision of totally air-tight
sacs or chambers, particularly when grouped close
together, do not allow for ventilation and can cause a
patient to perspire heavily and become uncomfortably hot.It is an object of the present invention to at
least minimize the above-mentioned disadvantages.EP-A-0292218 discloses an improved bed system
having two inflatable bladders with a pre-set pressure
differential therebetween and indicates the possibility of
utilising a forced air ventilation system in one
embodiment.According to the present invention there is
provided a zero-loss, multi-pressure, air support system
comprising an air support means in the form of a mattress
assembly having a first plurality of inflatable, air-tight,
air sacs forming chambers which are connected together in
at least first and second pressure zones, each of said
pressure zones being operated at a pre-selected pressure, a
specific pressure being selected for each zone, and multi-section
pressure regulation means which operates to inflate
said first pressure zone to a first pressure and operates
to inflate said second pressure zone to

<CLAIMS>
A zero-loss, multi-pressure, air support system
comprising an air support means in the form of a mattress

assembly having a first plurality of inflatable, air-tight,
air sacs forming chambers (10) which are connected together

in at least first and second pressure zones (11), each of
said pressure zones being operated at a pre-selected

pressure, a specific pressure being selected for each zone,
and multi-section pressure regulation means (12) which

operates to inflate said first pressure zone to a first
pressure and operates to inflate said second pressure zone

to a second pressure which is different from the first
pressure, and further including forced air ventilation

means;

   characterised in that said forced air ventilation
means includes a second plurality of inflatable air sacs

with apertures (16) forming second chambers, an air supply
pump (52), and a manifold (15), said second chambers being

connected to the manifold (15), said air supply pump (52)
providing a stream of air through the manifold (15) to the

inflatable air sacs, and said apertures (16) providing a
ventilation air stream.
An air support system as claimed in claim 1,
further including a group of air-tight inflatable sacs

(130) forming chambers which are connected to form three
pressure zones, (131, 132, 133) a pressure being selected

for said third pressure zone, and wherein the multi-section
pressure regulating means (12) operates to inflate said

third pressure zone to a pressure selected to be different
from the first and from the second pressure.
A zero-loss air support system, as claimed in claim
1, wherein the mattress assembly comprises:


a first plurality of inflatable sacs which are
completely air-tight connected together so as to form at

least a first group (47) and a second group (48) of sacs, 
each group defining an individual pressure zone capable to

operate at a different pressure; and
means (45, 46) for applying pressure to each group
of sacs until each zone is inflated to a different pre-selected

pressure;
and further including a second plurality of
inflatable sacs (51) with apertures (16) defined therein;

and
means (50) for maintaining a continuous supply of
forced air, said apertures (16) providing a ventilating air

stream.
A zero-loss air support system as claimed in claim
3, wherein said means for applying pressure includes a

first manifold connected to apply pressure to the first
group of sacs; a second manifold connected to apply

pressure to the second group of sacs; and means for
supplying pressure to said first and second manifolds.
A zero-loss air support system as claimed in claim
4, further including a third group of completely air-tight

inflatable sacs (49) connected to form a third group
defining a further pressure zone, and wherein said means

(45, 46) for applying pressure includes a third manifold
connected to the third group of sacs for applying pressure

to said third manifold, whereby each pressure zone may be
maintained at a different pre-selected pressure.
A zero-loss air support system as claimed in
claims 3, 4 or 5, wherein said means for maintaining a

continuous supply of forced air includes a manifold
connected to said second plurality of inflatable sacs, and

a source of air under pressure for maintaining the
plurality of sacs inflated while the ventilating air stream

is provided. 
A zero-loss support system as claimed in claims 2,
3, 4, 5 or 6, wherein an inflatable sac of the first

plurality of sacs and an inflatable sac of the second
plurality of sacs are formed by a triple membrane

arrangement, two of the membranes providing a completely
air-tight chamber and a third, outer membrane having

apertures, said outer membrane connected so as to form a
chamber which is capable to discharge a ventilating air

stream.
