<ABSTRACT>
To extend an operable range of a hybrid excitation type 
permanent magnet synchronous motor having a field of a 

permanent magnet and a dc excitation coil, magnetic flux of the 
field is controlled so as to be kept constant when a rotation speed of 

the motor is smaller than a predetermined base speed and so as 
to be changed in reverse proportion with the rotation speed of the 

motor when the rotation speed is larger than the predetermined 
base speed. Electric current and voltage to an armature of the 

motor is controlled such that a current ratio of a direct-axis 
component and a quadrature-axis component which components 

are obtained by dividing an electric current to the armature coil 
into the direct-axis component and the quadrature-axis 

component relative to the voltage induced in the armature coil, is 
kept constant.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method and a control system for
controlling a hybrid excitation type permanent magnet
synchronous motor of the kind as defined in the preamble of claims 1 and 7, respectively.Conventionally, a speed control of a permanent magnet
synchronous motor has been implemented such that three-phase
current or voltage for controlling the inverter is produced by
detecting a rotation speed of the motor and compensating the
rotation speed command by the feedback of the detected rotation
speed. On the other hand, in a torque control the feedback of the
detected rotation speed has been implemented to a current
command instead of the rotation speed command. In case that a
constant-output operation of such a motor is implemented by
keeping the power source voltage constant, as a method for
broadening operable speed area of the motor by raising the
maximum rotation speed, a so-called demagnetization control has
been proposed, in which an electric current is applied to an
armature coil for canceling the magnetic flux of the permanent
magnet, in order to equivalently reduce induced voltage. Fig. 36
shows a characteristic curve obtained from such a
demagnetization control. A control method and a control system of the above-mentioned
kind is known from EP-A-0 167 158.It is an object of the present invention to provide a control method
and control system of a hybrid excitation type permanent magnet
synchronous motor, which control method and system enable the
operable speed range of the motor to be further broadened.The motor control method according to the present invention 
is characterized in that electric current and voltage to the armature are
controlled such that a current ratio of a direct-axis current component
and a quadrature-axis current component which components are obtained
by dividing an electric current to the armature coil into the direct-axis
current component and the quadrature-axis current component relative to
the voltage induced in the armature coil is kept constant; in that at least
one of said magnet flux controlling and said constant current ratio controlling
are selected to control the motor; and in that with said constant
current ratio controlling being selected said current ratio is kept constant,
between -0.3 and -1.2, while changing the flux.The control system according to the present invention is characterized in
that it further comprises: second control means for controlling electric
current and voltage to the armature such that a current ratio of a
