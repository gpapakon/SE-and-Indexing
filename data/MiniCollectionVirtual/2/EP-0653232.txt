<ABSTRACT>
A block toy includes a plurality of blocks (102 - 111) 
each of which is formed by mutually connecting unit blocks 

selected from a first to a 25th unit block, the unit blocks 
being made by cutting an imaginary base block (10) by four 

horizontal imaginary cutting planes (m1 - m4) parallel to each 
other and four vertical imaginary cutting planes (n1 - n4) 

parallel to each other in such a way that each unit block is 
designated the first to 25th unit block, respectively, 

arranged from left to right and from top to bottom. In order 
to built up a structure, a first and a second group of blocks 

are used in combination. That is, the blocks (102 - 107) of 
the first group are structured by connecting a unit block or 

unit blocks selected from the 11th through 15th unit block to 
the unit blocks corresponding to the second, fourth, seventh 

through ninth, 17th through 19th, 22nd and 24th unit block 
and, while the blocks (108 - 111) of the second group are 

structured by connecting a unit block or unit blocks selected 
from the second through fourth unit block and/or the 22nd 

through 24th unit block to the blocks corresponding to the 
seventh through ninth, 12th, 14th, and 17th through 19th unit 

block.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a block toy able 
to construct a variety of structures by connecting a plurality 
of blocks to each other. Conventionally, there have been proposed various 
types of block toys. For example, one known block toy is 
shown in Japanese Laid-Open Patent Publication No. 57-60034, 
which discloses that each block 102 of the block toy is 
constructed approximately H-shaped with a through-hole formed 
in the center thereof, referring to Fig. 1. In order to 
connect blocks 102 to each other, two blocks 102 adjacent to 
each other are sandwiched in between a pair of legs of another 
block 102. As shown in Fig. 1, each block 102 is constructed 
to be the same in its configuration with a unit dimension [a]. 
These blocks have a characteristic and an advantage that they 
can be freely connected to each other in such a way that they 
are aligned in one direction, in two or there dimensions. Two 
adjacent blocks do not have, however, a self-connecting 
function, i.e., they cannot be connected to each other without 
the intermediary of a third block. In addition, these blocks 
have such a disadvantage as when they are connected to each 
other, at least one side surface of a structure never fails 
to become uneven in appearance, i. e., the lateral of a block 
is not flushed with that of another block connected to the 
former on the side and it is impossible to make all the side 
surfaces of the structure flat and even.  It is an object of the present invention to provide 
a block toy including blocks having self-connecting function. It is another object of the present invention to 
provide a block toy including blocks which make it possible 
to flush the lateral of a block with that of another block 
connected to the former on each side of a structure built up 
by them. According to one aspect of the 
present invention, there is provided a block toy comprising 
any desired blocks selected from a first group of blocks comprising six 
different types of blocks, namely a first to a sixth block 
each of which is symmetrical with respect to a line, each of 
which is formed by connecting at least one desired unit block 
selected from a 11th through a 15th unit block to essential 
unit blocks corresponding to a second, fourth, seventh, 
eighth, ninth, 17th, 18th, 19th, 22nd and 24th unit block. 
The arrangement may be such that twenty-five unit blocks from a 
first to a 25th unit block are formed from a rectangular base 
block [8 x a] in vertical length and [6 x a] in horizontal length 
by
