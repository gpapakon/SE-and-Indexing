<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to an apparatus
for producing frozen particles of a liquid and, more
particularly, to an apparatus having a liquid nozzle
for introducing liquid droplets to be frozen and a
plurality of flat spray cryogenic nozzles for creating
an entrapment zone of atomized droplets of cryogenic
fluid so as to freeze the liquid droplets to produce
frozen particles.The formation of physically uniform and chemically
homogeneous spherical frozen particles from aqueous
biological solutions and suspensions is essential to
the manufacture of unit dose tablets for the
pharmaceutical and diagnostic industries. Physically
uniform particles minimize variability in bulk density
and provide for tablet manufacturing processes that can
produce tablets which vary in weight by no more than
about one percent. Homogeneous chemical composition of
the particles is needed to insure an accurate unit
dose. From a manufacturing perspective it is desirable
for frozen particles which are processed in various
types of manufacturing tablet making equipment to
exhibit the free flow properties characteristic of 
spherical particles. Furthermore, any manufacturing
process for obtaining frozen particles with these
desired characteristics should operate efficiently to
offset the generally high cost of reagents and other
raw materials.Known techniques used in processing granular
products include dry blending, direct compression, wet
granulation, particle fabrication by coating product
nuclei with discrete ingredients, fluidized bed
granulation and spray freezing of frozen particles.Spray freezing methods generally produce highly
uniform particles as a result of their
characteristically rapid freezing processes. However,
spray freezing is generally an expensive technique due
to the high cost of refrigerants and the relatively
large product losses which can occur.Typical methods of spray freezing include striking
or impinging a solution to be frozen into or against a
liquid refrigerant stream(s) or spray(s), spraying a
solution to be frozen onto the surface of a bath of
liquid refrigerant, and spraying solution to be frozen
through a freezing zone. Examples of refrigerants
typically used to accomplish this freezing include
liquid nitrogen, liquid carbon dioxide, and
fluorocarbons. Some of the disadvantages of these
known methods are: insufficient throughput to support
manufacturing sale needs, loss of product due to
partial freezing and/or accumulation on the sides of
the freeze chamber, and inefficient uses of cryogenic
liquids.DE-
