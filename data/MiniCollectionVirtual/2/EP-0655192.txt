<ABSTRACT>
An improved method for producing potato microtubers 
by tissue culture is provided. The improvement 

comprises culturing potato plants in a medium containing 
a high sugar content, i.e., 8% (w/v), for about 1 to 4 

weeks under the light prior to culturing the plants in 
the dark to produce the microtubers.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method for
producing potato microtubers whereby large microtubers
which can be directly planted in the field are
efficiently produced.A first method for producing potato microtubers
that is popularly employed in practice comprises the
steps of growing virus-free plants and then forming and
growing microtubers.A second method is described in Japanese Laid-open
Patent Application No. 3-35738. This Laid-open Patent
Application discloses a process for producing potato
microtubers comprising the following three steps:
(A) Potato plants are tissue-cultured to produce
virus-free plants having stems and leaves (Illumination:
1,000 - 100,000 lux for 6 - 24 hours/day, at 20 - 30°C);(B) The plants are cultured at a low temperature
(10 - 30°C) under a short daylength (1,000- 100,000 lux
for 12 hours or less), thereby inducing a state in
which the apical buds or axillary buds are converted to
microtubers; (C) Apical buds or axillary buds induced in the
preceding step are converted into microtubers in the
dark at a low temperature (10 - 30°C).In the second method, a step of inducing the state
in which the apical buds and axillary buds are converted
to microtubers at low temperature and under a short
daylength is inserted between the two steps of the first
method. This step was presumably inserted taking into
consideration the general property of potatoes that the
formation of microtubers is induced at a low
temperature and under a short daylength, which property
is known and described in the literature.Thus, via the second method, microtubers are
effectively produced by three steps, i.e., step A:
growth of virus-free plants; step B: induction of the
state in which the apical buds and axillary buds are
converted into microtubers; and step C: formation and
growth of microtubers.It is another characteristic feature of the second
method that step C is carried out at a low temperature
in the dark. In general, the formation and growth of
the microtubers are carried out in the dark or under a
short daylength. Although the reason why the low
temperature condition is indispensable is not clear, it
is probably because the formation of potato microtubers
is promoted at low temperature.It seems true that the conversion into
microtubers is promoted, and the number of formed
microtubers is increased, by the short day treatment
after the stem and leaf-growing step. However, since
the efficiency of production of large microtubers (not
less than 0.5 g) which can be directly planted in the
field is
