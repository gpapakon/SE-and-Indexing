<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a recording medium
suitable for use in an ink-jet recording method, a method
of forming images using such a recording medium, and a
method of producing a print using the recording medium,
and more particularly to a recording medium which exhibits
excellent ink receptivity, provides recorded images
excellent in brightness and prevents the occurrence of
curling, a method of forming images using such a recording
medium, and a method of producing a print using the
recording medium.An ink-jet recording method is a recording method in
which recording is conducted by generating and flying
droplets of an ink by one of various ink ejection systems,
for example, an electrostatic attraction system, a system
using a piezoelectric element to give an ink mechanical
vibration or change, or a system in which an ink is heated
to form bubbles in the ink, thereby using the pressure
thus produced, and applying the droplets in whole or in
part to a recording medium such as paper. The ink-jet
recording method attracts attention as a printing method 
which scarcely produces noise and can conduct high-speed
printing and multi-color printing.As inks for ink-jet recording, inks comprising water
as a principal component are mainly used from the
viewpoint of safety and recordability. Polyhydric
alcohols and/or the like are often added to such inks with
a view toward preventing the clogging of nozzle and
improving ejection stability.As recording media used in this ink-jet recording
method, there have heretofore been used ordinary plain
paper and recording media called ink-jet recording paper
in which a porous ink-receiving layer is provided on a
base material.With the improvement in performance of ink-jet
recording apparatus, such as speeding up of recording and
multi-coloring of images, and the spread of such ink-jet
recording apparatus, recording media are also being
required to have higher and wider properties. More
specifically, in order to obtain recorded images high in
resolution and quality, the recording media for ink-jet
recording are required to simultaneously satisfy basic
requirements, for example, the following properties:
(1) receiving ink therein as quick as possible;(2) in case ink dots overlap each other, preventing
the ink of a dot applied later from running out into a dot
applied earlier; (3) preventing an ink droplet from diffusing thereon
to enlarge the diameter of an ink dot beyond its need;(4) providing dots having a substantially round
shape and a smooth periphery; and(5)
