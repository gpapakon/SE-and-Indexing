<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a method and a device for regulating the power (performance) of an air-breathing fuel cell system which consists of an air supply line, a fuel cell, an air outlet line and a separate gas supply system for the hydrogen gas. In order to regulate the fuel cell power, it is proposed to arrange a compressor having an adjustable rotation speed in the air supply line and an expander having a variable suction capacity in the air outlet line, the compressor, the expander and an additional electric motor being arranged on a common shaft. The expander converts the pressure energy contained in the exhaust air into mechanical energy and emits this energy via the common shaft to the compressor. The air mass flow is regulated at a predetermined nominal value via the rotation speed of the compressor, a predetermined operating pressure being set in the fuel cell system at the same time, by matching the suction capacity of the expander.

A device to regulate the output of an air-breathing fuel cell (12) with a
variable speed compressor (6) positioned in the air supply line (3) to the fuel

cell (12) and with an expander (16) with adjustable absorption capacity
positioned in the air removal line (5), whereby the compressor (6) and the

expander (16) are positioned on a common shaft (20),
characterised in that
positioned on the common shaft (20) is an electric motor (3) which is
supplied with voltage from the fuel cell system (1) and to which is

connected a current regulator (13),
that a control device (11) is provided to determine a pre-set air flow volume
(V
sdl
) and a pre-set operating pressure (p
L
) in the cathode chamber of the
fuel cell (12) dependent upon the fuel cell voltage (U
BZ
), the fuel cell current
(I
BZ
), the compressor speed (n) and the air flow volume (V
Air
),
which is suitable to set the pre-set air flow volume (V
ref
) with a speed
control device for the electric motor (30) using the current regulator (13)

and the pre-set operating pressure (p
L
) using the absorption capacity of the
expander (16) to the pre-set reference values.
A device in accordance with Claim 1,
characterised in that
upstream of the expander (16) is provided a flap (32) through which
ambient air can be taken in case of under-pressure.
A device in accordance with Claim 1,
characterised in that
also positioned on the common shaft (20) in addition to the electric motor
(30) is a starter motor (28) which is supplied with voltage by a starter

battery (9).
A device in accordance with Claim 3,
characterised in that
the electric motor (30) is a permanently excited synchronous motor.
