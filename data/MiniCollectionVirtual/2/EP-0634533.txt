<ABSTRACT>
Insulating panel to be applied either onto roofs or against 
inner or outer walls of inhabited buildings. 
Panel comprising a part (14) made of foamed plastic 

material, shaped on its surface with relief parts (15) and 
depressed parts (17, 18) for laying and supporting a 

plurality of roof covering elements of different forms, said 
part (14) being coated on its surface with one or more layers 

of waterproofing material like the bitumen emulsion and 
thereafter with eventual fine-grained solid material to 

roughen such surface. 
Panel comprising also a plurality of relief parts (67) on its 
upper surface, in which drilled inner inserts (68) are 

provided, which are made of material with hardness and 
mechanical strenght higher than those of the panel material. 

Thus, the roof covering elements may be fixed to such inner 
inserts (68) without damaging the panel material. 
Support panel acting as insulation, as waterproofing material 
and provided with a simple, light and cheap structure.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to an insulating panel for inhabited 
buildings, particularly applicable on the roof thereof and 
realized in such a manner as to perform the function of 
insulating and waterproofing material as well as of support 
structure. At the present time, the roof covering for 
inhabited buildings is carried out by utilizing particular 
support structures, made of masonry or wood etc.., which are 
generally arranged inclined at directions opposite and joined 
to each other on the ridge of the roof, onto which a 
plurality of insulating panels placed side by side and 
reciprocally joined is disposed, with the interposition of 
one or more layers of suitable per se known waterproofing 
material, panels onto which the roof tiles, the bent tiles or 
other similar per se known covering elements are then laid, 
in a manner that an air circulation for the ventilation and 
thermal stabilization of the whole assembly be established in 
the hollow space provided between said covering elements and 
said panels. This kind of coverages for inhabited buildings 
has evident limitations and inconveniences in use, resulting 
from both the presence of insulating panels generally 
constituted by polystyrene foam or other similar porous 
plastic materials, which in the course of time are subject to 
eventual reciprocal disconnections and water seepages, caused 
by the atmospheric precipitations, winds and other natural 
agents, with consequent progressive decay of the roof 
insulation and waterproofing, and the constructive complexity 
of the same coverages, which require to perform several 
operating steps involving many working weeks, thus resulting 
to be complicated and economically burdensome. The object of 
the present invention is to overcome the above mentioned 
inconveniences and limitations of the present roof coverages, 
by utilizing an insulating panel according to the invention, 
which is obtained with such constructive characteristics as 
to simplify and reduce the component parts of said coverages, 
being also applicable for different functions in the  
 
inhabited buildings. Moreover, this insulation panel is adapted to insure in as 
simple and rapid manner the safe support and fixing of the 
covering elements to be fitted onto any kind of roofs, and in 
particular of highly inclined roofs, by preventing any 
possibility of fallings, detachings and undesired damagings 
thereof. This insulating panel is obtained with the features 
substantially described with particular reference to the 
attache
