<ABSTRACT>
A control circuit (17) synchronizes operation of 
a latching relay (K0) to extend contact life. The relay 

(K0) is switched using an H-bridge drive circuit (22). The 
synchronization is done using a two-step delay. The first 

delay is provided by a phase shifter (35), which delays the 
timing signals used by a logic controller (20) relative to 

a zero crossing. The second delay is provided by an 
adjustable timer circuit (22) including a potentiometer 

(UR2). The two delays are used so that the latching relay 
(K0) is tripped at a selectable time coinciding with the 

second zero crossing after a switching command is received.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to control of a latching 
relay and, more particularly, to synchronization of relay 
contact switching. In providing electrical circuits to a facility, 
such as a home, one or more branch circuits are wired to 
distribute electrical power to load devices, such as light 
fixtures or outlet receptacles. Typically, the receptacle 
or fixture is hardwired directly to the branch circuit, 
with power to the device being turned on or off at the 
device itself. For example, a light fixture might include 
a pull cord for actuating a switch, while a small appliance 
might include a power switch. With recent technological developments it is both 
possible and advantageous to provide automated control of 
load devices to provide, for example, remote or timed 
switching. One such system directs all communication 
functions into a master system controller. This gives a 
homeowner flexible communication and power control from 
anywhere in the home there is a control panel or switch, or 
even anywhere there is a telephone, such as the car or 
office. An intelligent outlet receptacle or fixture block 
allows individual appliances or fixtures to be separately 
and automatically controlled as necessary or desired. To 
do so, some means must be provided far controlling 
switching of power to the load device. To be practical, 
the switching must be done inexpensively and accurately. 
A latching relay has been found to be readily adaptable to  
 
such an application. A latching relay is latched when 
connected to a positive polarity voltage source and 
unlatched when connected to a negative polarity voltage 
source. A latching relay includes a relay coil and an 
electrical contact switched by the relay coil. The relay 
contact is connected between an AC power source and the 
load device. Opening and closing of the contact can 
produce arcing if the transition occurs at a non-zero point 
on the AC input waveform. This requires that a larger 
capacity relay be used, increasing expenses and size, to 
withstand these conditions. Therefore, a desire exists to 
avoid arcing so that a smaller relay can be used. A known 
procedure for minimizing arcing is to synchronize the 
switching of the contact to the AC line input. 
Particularly, the relay is controlled to lead energization 
of the relay so that the expected contact switching time 
occurs at or close to a zero crossing of the AC input. Without any synchronization the switching occurs 
randomly. Thus, arcing may or may not occur. While this 
situation is
