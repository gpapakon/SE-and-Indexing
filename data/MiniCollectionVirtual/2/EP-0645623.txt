<ABSTRACT>
A method of monitoring the concentration of certain plating bath major constituents such as acid is provided 
which is insensitive to the effects of hydrogen produced during plating. The method involves applying an ac 

signal superimposed on a dc potential to a sensing electrode in contact with the solution, producing an ac 
response current. The steady state value of the ac response current is then measured and provides an accurate 

indication of the acid concentration within the solution. The method can be performed using a single sensing 
electrode. Furthermore, the method complements and is usually integrated with known voltammetric techniques 

and equipment suitable for analysis of other plating bath constituents.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention was made with support provided by
the United States Government under Contract Number
DAAB07-88-A047 awarded by the Department of the Army.
The U.S. Government has certain rights in this
invention.The present invention relates generally to plating
baths and methods for monitoring the constituents
contained therein. More particularly, the method of the
present invention relates to a voltammetric analysis
technique for monitoring the concentration levels of
certain plating bath major constituents such as acid.
The method can be used to maintain desired constituent
concentrations in order to ensure optimal plating bath
performance.A typical plating bath solution is comprised of a
combination of several distinct electrochemical
constituents which can be broadly divided into major
constituents and trace constituents. The major
constituents typically make up about 2 to 50 percent of
the total bath weight or volume. Trace constituents are
present in smaller quantities, usually less than 1
percent of the total weight or volume. Acid is an
important major constituent in many plating baths. For
example, in an acid cadmium plating bath, acid typically
represents about 5 to 10 percent of the total bath
weight.The concentration levels of both major and trace
constituents will influence the quality of the resultant
plating deposit, and should therefore be regularly 
monitored. Methods have been developed for in-tank
monitoring of trace constituents as well as certain
major constituents. For example, U.S. Patent No.
4,631,116 discloses a method for monitoring trace
constituents using an in-tank electrochemical sensor.
Application Serial No. 08/037,158 entitled "Method of
Monitoring Major Constituents in Plating Baths"
and resulting in U.S. patent 5 336 380 discloses a method for in-tank monitoring of major
constituents such as sulfuric acid in an acid copper
bath. US patent 5 336 380 was published after the prior
date of the present application. The above patent and pending patent application
are owned by the same assignee as the present invention.
However, these techniques provide less than optimal
accuracy for certain types of acid, particularly in
plating baths in which large quantities of hydrogen are
produced during plating. For example, the above
voltammetric techniques are not well-suited to
measurement of acid in an acid cadmium bath. As a
result, alternative techniques are currently used to
measure acid cadmium concentrations.One such technique involves the use of two sensors;
one voltammetric,

comprising the steps of:

providing at least one sensing electrode in contact with
said solution; and
applying a voltammetric signal to said sensing electrode,
