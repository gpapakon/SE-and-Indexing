<CLAIMS>
A passenger seat for a public transport vehicle - in 
particular for an aeroplane - comprising at least one 

arm-rest (1) and at least one individual screen (2) 
associated with the arm-rest (1), the screen (2) being 

mounted to retract through a slot (3) provided in a top 
wall (4) of the front portion (5) of the arm-rest (1), 

and the screen (2) being associated via a hinged jib (6, 
7) to a plate (8) which is guided to move in vertical 

translation inside the front portion (5) of the arm-rest 
(1),
 
   the seat being characterized by the following, in 

combination: 

the plate (8) is slidably mounted on two guide 
columns (9, 10) disposed inside the arm-rest (1) 

substantially perpendicularly to the top wall (4) of the 
arm-rest (1) and at opposite ends of the plate (8), the 

plate (8) extending substantially parallel to the top 
wall (4) of the arm-rest (1); 
the hinged jib (6, 7) comprises an angled rod (6) 
hinged at one end about a vertical axis (13) to the plate 

(8), and a link rod (7) hinged at one of its ends (19 of 
18, 19) about a horizontal axis (15) to the other end 

(14) of the angled rod (6); and 
the screen (2) is hinged via its bottom portion 
(17) to the other end (18) of the link rod (7) that is 

remote from the end (19) of the link rod (7) which is 
hinged to the angled rod (6). 
A seat according to claim 1, characterized in that the 
hinge between the link rod (7) and the angled rod (6) 

includes a stop (20) that limits deployment of the link 
rod (7) relative to the angled rod (6) about the normal 

pivot axis (15), and a second hinge axis (21) parallel to 
the normal pivot axis (15), and including clamping means 

enabling the link rod (7) to pivot relative to the angled  
 

rod (6) beyond the stop (20), but only when the pivoting 
torque exceeds a predetermined value. 
A seat according to claim 1 or 2, characterized in 
that the screen (2) is hinged at the end (18) of the link 

rod (7) about a horizontal axis (22), orthogonal to the 
axis (15) of the hinge between the link rod (7) and the 

angled rod (6). 
A seat according to any one of claims 1 to 3, 
characterized in that the plate (8) is urged by resilient 

return means (23) towards its high position, in which the 
screen (2) is deployed outside the arm-rest (1), and in 

that it includes a locking device (24, 25) for locking 
the plate (8) in its low position, in which the screen 

(2) is retracted into the arm-rest (1). 
A seat according to claim 4, characterized in that the 
locking device (24, 25) is caused to lock and unlock by 

applying vertical downward pressure on the screen (2), 
and thus on the plate (8). 
A seat according to claim 4 or 5, characterized in 
that the locking device (24, 25) is constituted by a 

resilient tongue (24) secured to the arm-rest (1) or to 
the plate (8), and having a hook-shaped free end (29) co-operating 

with a bearing surface (25) secured to the 
plate (8) or to the arm-rest (1). 
A seat according to any one of claims 1 to 6, 

characterized in that the screen (2) is mounted relative 
to the arm-rest (1) in such a manner as to be flush with 

the top wall (4) of the arm-rest (1) when the screen is 
in its retracted position inside the arm-rest.
