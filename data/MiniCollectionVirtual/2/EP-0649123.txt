<ABSTRACT>
An object is to provide a fire alarm system 
adaptable to a large-size fire alarm system and capable of 

causing a receiving portion thereof to quickly detect fire 
information from a terminal unit or the like if the terminal 

unit or the like has been operated. In a fire alarm system 
in which terminal units, such as fire detectors, are 

connected to the receiving portion, an address is given to 
the terminal unit and which detects a terminal unit the 

status of which has been changed, wherein system polling or 
the like for a specific terminal unit, such as a 

transmitter, among the terminal units is performed prior to 

performing system polling of other terminal units.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a fire alarm system in which
terminal units, such as fire detectors, are connected to a
receiving portion thereof, and to the terminal units are given
addresses so that a terminal unit having a status change is
detected, according to the introduction of claim 1.As a fire alarm system in which terminal units, such
as fire detectors, are connected to a receiving portion thereof,
and to the terminal units are given addresses so that a terminal
unit having a status change is detected, a fire alarm system has
been disclosed in EP-2-0 381 018 for the
purpose of enabling the receiving portion to quickly detect a
terminal unit among the terminal units that has a status
change.The foregoing structure has an arrangement that the
terminal units are divided into a plurality of groups, the
timings at which the terminal units respond to the receiving
portion are made to be different among the groups of the
terminal units, a terminal unit having a status change responds
to the receiving portion (system polling) at a response timing
for a group to which the terminal unit having the status change
belongs, timings at which terminal units belonging to the group
to which the terminal unit that has responded to the receiving
portion at the system polling belongs respond to the receiving
portion are made to be different among the terminal units in the
group, the terminal unit having the status change responds to 
the receiving portion at the response timing for the terminal
unit (point polling), and the receiving portion collects
specific information from the terminal unit that has responded
to the receiving portion at the point polling (selecting).Thus, the operation for obtaining predetermined
information is performed for only the terminal unit having the
status change. The operation for obtaining the predetermined
information is not performed for the terminal units that are
free from the status change. Therefore, the status change of a
terminal unit can be detected in a shorter time as compared with
a structure in which the predetermined information is intended
to be sequentially obtained from all terminal units.The foregoing terminal units to be connected to the
receiving portion are fire detectors, smoke blocking and
exhausting units and transmitters. If the transmitter is
operated, a fire alarm is obliged to be generated within a
predetermined time from the commencement of the operation and
the response lamp of the transmitter that has been operated must
be turned on. If many terminal units
