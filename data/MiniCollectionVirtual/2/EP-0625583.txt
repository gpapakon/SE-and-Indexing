<ABSTRACT>
The disclosed material comprises different zones of a maximium size comprised between 60 and 
500 microns, wherein at least two substances have different hardness and friction coefficients, 

the harder the substance having the higher friction coefficient. Preferably, they are 
comprised of grians of hard material with a high friction coefficient, said grains being bound 

to each other by a binder material which fills the major part of the intergranular voids, the 
remainder of said voids being the porosities. Conveniently, if the lubricant contains an 

additive of the borate or sulfide type, the hard material is a passivatable steel containing 

one or varoius of the following elements; Cr, Mo, V, W, Si and the less hard material is a 
lightly allied steel.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a powder metallurgy
gearbox synchronization ring, suitable to operate in a
lubricating medium and in particular, but not exclusively, to the manufacture of synchronization rings for use in manual gearboxes, comprising different regions with a
maximum size comprised between 60 and 100 microns and
consisting of at least two materials having different
hardness, the harder material occupying between 1/3 and 4/5
of the total volume.The development of materials for gearboxes is subject
to many demands, some of them mutually contradictory. On
the one hand, the gears must be effectively lubricated,
i.e. the coefficient of friction between them must be as
low as possible, whilst on the other hand, the synchronizing
rings must have a high coefficient of friction which
remains constant independently, in particular, of the
temperature, the speed and the pressure.One suggestion (FR-A-2073831) is to cover the active surface of the
synchronizing rings with a suitable material such as molybdenum.
This method is expensive.Another technique is aimed at preventing an oil layer
from forming, or causing the oil film to break by means of 
creating geometric irregularities by machining grooves or
the like or by means of finer heterogeneities by using a
non-homogeneous material, in particular a relatively soft
matrix containing harder particles. DE-A-2354826 discloses the
use of Al2O3 as harder particles within the softer matrix.
FR-A-2207193 discloses the plasma spray coating of oxides or carbides
on near resistant bearing surfaces, the powder of the base metal
could be Al, Cu or Ni based alloy powder. The steel powder metallurgy gearbox
synchronization rings disclosed in DE-A-3808460 contain optionally 0.1-6% of at least one of Mn, Cr, Mo and optionally at least one of Ni and Cu in amount 0.1-6%.In the current state of the art powder metallurgy
gearbox synchronization rings are known, designed to
operate in lubricated media, said rings comprising
different regions, between 60 and 100 microns in size, and
at least two substances with different hardnesses and
different coefficients of friction, the harder substance
being the one with the higher coefficient of friction and
the one which occupies a volume between 1/3 and 4/5 of the
total volume. Powder metallurgy articles as disclosed in
GB-A-2157711 and WO-A-8700207 contain, similarly to the
above features, harder regions in a softer matrix.The remaining volume of the material is occupied by the
softer substance and by the porosity resulting
