<ABSTRACT>
The connector (1) comprises a female first element (2), a male 
second element (3) and an interposed gasket (4) acting as a 

connection element between the two elements (2, 3) which remain 
however free to mutually rotate about the connector axis (5). The 

component elements of the connector (1) can be sold separately as 
the non-releasable connection is formed simply by forcing the male 

element (3) into the female element (2) and can therefore be made 
by the installer immediately prior to installation.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a connector for conduit, in particular 
for electric cables. Conduit containing electric cables is currently connected to the 
electrical user by connectors in accordance with the introduction 
to claim 1. The last step in making the connection comprises clinching the 
inner end of the male element so that the two elements of the 
connector remain inseparably fixed together but able to rotate 
relative to each other, so enabling the installer to mount the 
connector without it being necessary to rotate the elements 
converging towards it, whether these be conduits or the terminal 
block of an electrical user. The installer installing such 
connectors selects those necessary on the basis of the two types 
of thread with which each connector is provided. The existence of 
various types of thread requires the availability of numerous 
types of connector and still more numerous reducers to allow 
possible adaptation. The need for the availability of such a wide range of connection 
products is a source of inconvenience for the manufacturer and 
seller, but in particular for the installer, who has only a small  
 
probability of carrying the appropriate connectors on site, 
particularly in the case of work which has not been previously 
programmed in detail. The object of the present invention is to obviate the aforesaid 
inconvenience. This object is attained by a connector in accordance with claim 1. 
At the moment of use the male element and female element (this 
latter provided with a hydraulic seal gasket) suitably chosen from 
the various ones available, can be forced into engagement by the 
installer to form the appropriate connection. The installer can therefore form the necessary connector by 
selecting from a small number of male and female elements which 
differ only in the thread which they carry. Reduction or 
adaptation elements are superfluous, and consequently the 
producer, seller and installer need therefore produce, stock and 
purchase only the various types of male and female elements which 
can be variously combined to form the required connector from the 
various connectors obtainable. The invention is illustrated by way of non-limited example on the 
figures of the accompanying drawings. 
Figure 1 is a partly full and partly sectional view of a connector 
of the invention in its mounted configuration; Figure 2 is a partly full and partly sectional view of the 
connector of Figure 1 in its exploded configuration. With reference to said figures, the connector of

<CLAIMS>
A connector (1) for conduit, in particular for cable, of 
the type comprising a female first element (2) and a male second 

element (3) coaxially joined together but such that they can 
rotate relatively about their axis, in which: 


said female first element (2) comprises coaxial to each other 
a first threaded portion (6) and a first handling element (7); 
said second male second element (3) comprises coaxial to each 
other a second threaded portion (9), a second handling element 

(10) and an annular portion (11) housable within said female first 
element (2); 
a hydraulic seal gasket (4) interposed between said first 
element (2) and said second element (3), 
 
characterised in that said hydraulic seal gasket (4) is of elastic 

material, the connection being made by interposing said gasket (4) 
between an undercut (13) in the male element (3) and the wall (14) 

of the seat (15) for the gasket, which faces it. 
A connector as claimed in claim 1, characterised in that 
the hydraulic seal gasket (4) is an O-ring. 
A connector as claimed in claim 1, characterised in that 
the undercut (13) in the male element (3) is associated with a 

second conical surface (12) converging towards the axis (5) of the 
connector (1) and intended to abut against a corresponding first 

conical surface (8) on the female element (2).
