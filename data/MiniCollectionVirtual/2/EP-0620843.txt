 COLORLESS DETERGENT COMPOS ITIONS WITH ENHANCED STABI L ITYTECHNICAL FIELD This invention relates to stable, colorless detergent compositions containing anionic and/or nonionic surfactant, oxygen bleach and metal sequestering agent.SUMMARY The present invention relates to a colorless detergent composition comprising:(a) from about 5% to about 95% by weight of anionic or nonionic surfactant;(b) from about 0.005% to about.10% by weight of oxygen bleach; and(c) from about 0.001% to about 8% by weight of metal sequestering agent; wherein the composition has a pH between about 4 and about 11, and a transmittance at 470 nm. of greater than about 85%.This composition exhibits good stability over time and under harsh temperatures.BACKGROUND INFORMATION Detergent compositions for performing a wide variety of household and industrial cleaning operations are known in the art and are formulated for optimized performance under the contemplated end use conditions. See for example U.S. Patents 4,555,360, Bissett et al , issued November 26, 1985; 4,435,317, Gerritsen et al , issued March 6, 1984; 4,681,704 Bernardino et al , issued July 21, 1987; 4,316,824, Pancheri, issued February 23, 1982; 4,904,359, Pancheri et al , issued February 27, 1990; 4,133,779, Hellyer et al , issued January 9, 1979, and 4,678,606, Akhter et al , issued July 7, 1987. Along with optimized performance, a product which- after storage is stable and aesthetically pleasing is desirable. It is especially difficult to achieve a stable colorless detergent composition. 

 It is possible to develop a clear detergent product; however, detergent ingredients such as anionic surfactants and suds boosters cause product yellowing or darkening over time. Dyes are often added to the compositions to compensate for this discoloration.It has been found that a stable colorless detergent composition can be attained by adding certain amounts of oxygen bleach and metal sequestering agent to anionic and/or nonionic surfactant.DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION The present invention encompasses detergent compositions which are stable and remain colorless over time, even under harsh temperatures. These detergent compositions contain three essential components:(1) from about 5% to about 95% by weight of anionic and/or nonionic surfactant;(2) from about 0.005% to about 10% by weight of oxygen bleach; and (3) from about 0.001% to about 8% by weight of metal sequestering agent.Optional ingredients, especially suds boosters, can be added to provide various performance and
