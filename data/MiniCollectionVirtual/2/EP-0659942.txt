<CLAIMS>
Sealing ring between a cover (3) and a manhole entrance (1) to an enamelled 
tank, comprising a sealing washer (5) of chemically resistant plastics 

with an apron (6) likewise of chemically resistant platics, which extends in 
the axial direction and which, in the installed condition, projects into the 

manhole entrance (1), 
characterized in that
 at least one groove (8, 10) of 
varying radius relative to the axis of the sealing washer (5) is provided o
n 
the upper side and the lower side of the sealing washer (5), an O-ring seal 

(9, 11) being disposed in each groove (8, 10), and the periphery of the 
sealing washer (5) being encircled by a dimensionally stabilizing, load-carrying 

binding (13). 
Sealing ring according to claim 1, 
characterized in that
 the upper side 
and lower side of the sealing washer (5) have a grooved profile (12) concentrical 

of the axis (A). 
Sealing ring according to claim 1 or 2, 
characterized in that
 the sealing 
washer (5) and apron (6) are interconnected by a groove and tongue arrangement 

(7). 
Sealing ring according to one of claims 1 to 3, 
characterized in that
 the 
binding (13) consists of a strip of special steel, the width of which is less 

than the thickness of the sealing washer (5). 
Sealing ring according to one of claims 1 to 4, 
characterized in that
 the 
binding (13) is provided with mounting links (14).  

 
Sealing ring according to one of claims 1 to 5, 
characterized in that
 the 
chemically resistant plastic material is polytetrafluorethylene.
