<ABSTRACT>
A fuel injection device functioning with pilot and main injection contains a pressure chamber (15) recessed into a hollow piston (8) for the pilot injection. In order to initiate the pilot injection the hollow piston (8) is axially displaced until a gap (a) is surmounted, and a stop is thereby activated, a plunger (13) reducing the volume of the pressure chamber (15) in order to increase the fuel pressure to the pilot injection pressure. The pilot injection sequence is terminated by surmounting of the gap (a) and activation of a stop, whilst preventing a pressure drop due to long discharge distances.

Fuel-injection device arranged for the purpose of injecting the pre-injection 
and main injection quantities of fuel and having a housing (2, 3, 4) in which 

is received in a longitudinally displaceable manner and in sequence in this 
direction a high pressure piston (6), a pressure chamber (7) and a hollow 

piston (8), 

wherein the high pressure piston (6) is subjected at times to an actuating 
force which acts upon its end face remote from the pressure chamber (7) 

causing a longitudinal displacement in the direction of the hollow piston (8) 
which is supported by way of a first spring (14) in the direction of the high 

pressure piston (6), 
furthermore having a solenoid valve (27) within a duct arrangement between 
a fuel supply line (23a) to the injection device and the pressure chamber (7) 

which is controlled in the direction blocking this duct arrangement during 
injection processes, 
furthermore having a pressure chamber (15) which is formed in the hollow 
piston (8) and is defined in a longitudinal direction by a pressure surface on 

the hollow piston (8), wherein the pressure surface is smaller than an end 
face (17) of the hollow piston (8) adjacent to the pressure chamber (7), so 

that its volume is compressed in the longitudinal direction against the force 
of the spring (14) during a first range of longitudinal movements of the hollow 

piston (8), causing a defined pre-injection quantity of fuel to be supplied by 
way of a pressure duct (18) which is fixed to the housing, communicates 

with an injection needle (11a) of the injection device and is flow connected 
to the pressure chamber (7), 
and having a counterstop (31), which is fixed to the housing, for terminating 
an injection pausing stroke of the hollow piston (8) which follows on from the 

pre-injection stroke, 
characterised in that
 a plunger (13), which is provided on both sides with  
 

cylindrical projections (13a, 13b) protrudes into the hollow piston (8) which 
encompasses the pressure chamber (15), wherein the spring (14) which Is 

disposed coaxial to the upper projection (13a) is supported at one end on the 
plunger (13) and at the other end on an inner surface (16) of the hollow 

piston (8) and wherein the pressure surface is defined by the radius (b) of 
the pressure chamber (15) and the upper projection (13a), and wherein the 

spring (14) holds the lower projection (13b) in position with a spring plate 
(10) which for its part is inserted into the housing (2, 3, 4) by a second spring 

(11), which is dimensioned greater than the spring (14) and simultaneously 
forms a closing spring of the injection needle (11a), influenced in the 

direction of the pressure chamber (7) displaceable in a longitudinal direction, 
and wherein for the purpose of initiating the pre-injection stroke the spring 

plate (10) adjacent to a lower end face (12) of a housing part (2) is at a 
small spaced disposition (a) with respect to the hollow piston (8), which 

space is overcome for the purpose of injecting the pre-injection quantity by 
means of the longitudinal movement of the hollow piston (8), Wherein the 

relative displacement of the plunger (13) in the hollow piston (8) displaces 
the pre-injection quantity of fuel,
 
and wherein in order to terminate the injection pausing stroke a stop formed 

as a shoulder (30) on the spring plate (10) moves into position against the 
housing-side counterstop (31).
