<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a method for analysis, in whole or in part, of information contained in data structures in order to supply an external system with the information necessary for routing the said data structures or for processing them by an intelligent external system, in which meaningful fields of the said data structures are analysed, particularly the source or destination addresses, by using the principle of translation tables by successive indirect addressing in a two-dimensional table TRIE (i, j), each row of the table constituting a register with 2
<
k
>
 cells where k is the length of the slice addressed. In this method, the search in the translation tables is performed at the rate of the incoming information, per slice of data structure.

Process for the analysis of all or part of the informations contained
in data structures in order to supply to an external system the informations necessary

for the dispatching of said data structures or for their processing by an intelligent
external system in which analysis takes place of the significant fields of said data

structures, particularly the source or destination addresses, using the principle of
translation tables by successive indirections in a two-dimensional array TRIE (i, j),

each line of the table constituting a register with 2
k
 cells, in which k is the length of
the addressed segment, wherein the search in the translation tables takes place at the

clock cycle of the entering information by data structure segments, in such a way as to
start the search before having completely received the data structure, the content of a

cell making it possible, after a time equal to a few data segments, to address the
following segment, or to indicate if the search has failed, or supply an operating

information for an intelligent external system, or a value, particularly for dispatching,
associated with the content of the active data structure, wherein the informations are

supplied to an associated automaton and wherein the check informations of the
protocol and the addressing informations of the protocol are both processed.
Process according to claim 1, wherein several successive analyses
can be carried out and the same table can be used for several search types using

different paths, e.g. by commencing the searches with different gate registers.
Process according to claim 1, wherein it is possible to exclude from
the search any ancillary or non-ancillary part of the data structure, without alignment

constraint of the field or a subpart of that part which is tested on the segment frontier
and without interrupting the search process.
Process according to any one of the preceding claims, wherein the
data structures are dispatched by source routing.
Process according to claim 4, wherein the source routed frame
comprises a routing information field constituted by several fields, including a RT

field indicating the routing type and a LTH field indicating the length in bytes of the
routing information field, and a sequence of route designators and wherein the

analysis of the RT and LTH fields is obtained by consulting the TRIE memory which
supplies a function for the frames of the ARE or STE type used by the end systems

for producing their own routing tables, an error if the LTH field has an incorrect
value and the duration precalculated in segments if the frame is of the SRF type. 
Process according to claim 5, wherein the dispatching information
is obtained by the analysis of the route designator zone, which describes the path

which must be followed by a frame, the path being described by the succession of
links taken (LAN identifiers LANid) and the traversed nodes (bridge identifiers BN).
Process according to claim 6, wherein dispatching is established by
the recognition of a particular sequence (LANID., BN, LANid) in a RD field,

recognition taking place in such a way that until a first LAN identifier has been
recognized, the bridge identifier is ignored and the search is recommenced, as soon as

a LAN identifier has been recognized, dispatching is obtained after analysis of the
bridge identifier and the LAN identifier which follow, the "until" condition being

obtained by an adapted programming of the TRIE memory: a failure during the
analysis of one of the segments of a LANid pointing towards the dummy registers

pointing either towards the following dummy register, or for the last towards the gate
register in order to recommence the search.
Process according to claim 7, wherein the dispatching, which is
dependent on the frame direction, is obtained at the end of analysis by indirection on

the stored intermediate result when the sequence has been recognized and by indexing
by a direction bit recorded beforehand.
Process according to claim 7, wherein the same LAN identifier in a
LANid, BN, LANid sequence traversing the latter appearing more than once in the

route designator sequence is detected.
