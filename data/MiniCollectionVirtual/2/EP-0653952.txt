<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a treatment device of 
the kind having a particulate treatment bed for the 
treatment of a liquid flowing through the treatment bed. The particulate treatment medium has to be 
periodically rejuvenated which generally requires the 
treatment device to be taken off line while it is 
backwashed in situ, or the treatment medium is removed for 
rejuvenation or is replaced, leaving the treatment device 
out of action for considerable periods (see, for example, US-B-492 716). According to the present invention a treatment device is provided 
according to claim 1, which avoids this disadvantage. Such a fluidising unit ensures that the treatment 
medium particles can be removed efficiently from the bed 
without contacting a pump impeller. The treatment medium 
removed through the discharge duct is replaced by particles 
from above which fall under gravity or pressure into the 
space created by the evacuation of the treatment medium. 
In this way the treatment medium will tend to progress down 
through the treatment bed ensuring that all of the bed can 
be cleaned cyclically. The material which has been removed from the bed may 
be lead to a rejuvenating means, wherein it is rejuvenated  
 
and reused, or may be disposed of or made use of elsewhere. 
For example if the particles of the treatment medium are 
combustible, the treatment might be to filter and hence deoil 
oily water, thereby increasing the calorific value of 
the particles and enabling them to be used as a fuel. It is therefore possible gradually to remove the 
particulate treatment medium from the treatment bed for 
rejuvenation while the treatment device is still on line. Fluidising units of a type suitable for use in the 
present invention are disclosed in our earlier US-A-4978251, 
4952099 and 4992006. The operation of the fluidising unit may be improved 
if the liquid supply duct has means for swirling the 
liquid. The treatment device is particularly effective as a 
filter device wherein the rejuvenating means is a separator 
for separating contaminants from the treatment medium. Conventional filters have to be backwashed when the 
filter bed becomes clogged by contaminants. This requires 
liquid to be drained from the filter bed, air to be blown 
through the bed to break it up and water to be passed back 
through the bed to wash out the contaminants. This not 
only causes the filter to be off line for long periods but 
also results in lost water and some lost particles of 
filter medium. The use of the
