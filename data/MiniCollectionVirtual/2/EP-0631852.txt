<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a device for fitting a seal (J), provided with a fastening clamp (P) of U-shaped cross-section, on a bodywork frame (B), the said device especially including means for clamping the arms (P1, P2) of the said U-shaped clamp (P) against the said frame. According to the invention, the said means for tightening the arms comprise at least one jaw provided with at least one bearing face (1, 2) which can be moved both parallel to the arms (P1, P2) along the clamp (P) and in a substantially perpendicular plane in order to come into contact over its entire surface with the outer lateral face of the arm opposite and deform the latter through even and progressive compression.

A device for fitting a seal (J), provided with a fastening clamp (P) having a U-shaped 
cross section, to a bodywork frame (B), said device comprising, in 

particular, means for tightening the branches (P1, P2) of said U-shaped clamp 
(P) against said frame, characterised in that said means for tightening the 

branches comprise at least one jaw (10, 20) provided with at least one bearing 
face (1, 2) which can be displaced both parallel to the branches (P1, P2) along 

the clamp (P) and in a substantially perpendicular plane so as to come into 
contact, over its whole surface, with the outer lateral face of the branch facing 

it and so as to deform the latter by regular and progressive compression. 
A device according to Claim 1, characterised in that it comprises at least one 
feed roller (3, 4) which procures the relative longitudinal displacement and the 

guiding of said bearing face (1, 2) parallel to the branches (P1, P2) by rotation 
in contact with said clamp (P). 
A device according to one of the preceding claims, characterised in that it 
comprises two bearing faces (1, 2) arranged symmetrically on either side of the 

clamp (P). 
A device according to one of the preceding claims, characterised in that each 
bearing face (1, 2) is carried by the inner lateral face of a shoe (10, 20) 

connected to a housing (5) in which the means for controlling and monitoring 
the movement of said shoe are housed. 
A device according to Claim 4, characterised in that said housing (5) is 
constituted by two parts (51, 52) assembled side by side; each of said parts 

being connected to at least one shoe (10, 20). 
A device according to Claims 2 and 5, characterised in that said roller (3, 4) is 
mounted on the lower part of the housing (5) and is adapted to roll over the 

upper part of the seal (J).  
 
A device according to one of Claims 4 to 6, characterised in that said housing 
(5) comprises a control handle (6). 
A device according to one of Claims 4 to 7, characterised in that at least one 
of the lateral parts (51, 52) of the housing (5) is movable laterally in 

translation so as to displace the shoe (10, 20) and its bearing face (1, 2) 
transversely to the branch (P1, P2) facing it. 
A device according to one of Claims 4 to 8, characterised in that said shoe (10, 
20) is movable longitudinally relative to the housing (5). 
A device according to Claims 2 and 9, characterised in that it comprises two 
feed rollers (3, 4) located respectively in front of and behind the housing (5); 

said shoe (10, 20) being movable between the two rollers (3, 4). 
A device according to one of the preceding claims, characterised in that it 
further comprises at least one holding body (8) constituted by a rod (18) 

connected to the housing (5) and having its free end in contact, for the 
purposes of guiding and holding, under the frame (B) by means of a roller 

wheel (80). 
A device according to one of Claims 4 to 11, characterised in that said shoe 
(10, 20) is pivotable in a plane substantially perpendicular to said 

branches (P1, P2). 
A device according to one of Claims 4 to 12, characterised in that said shoe 
(10, 20) comprises at least one roller wheel (12, 21) rotatable by contact 

with the branch (P1, P2) facing it when said shoe is moved forward. 
A device according to one of Claims 4 to 13, characterised in that said bearing 
face (1, 2) is constituted by a pad fixed to the shoe (10, 20) which is capable 

of being put under pressure.  
 
A device according to one of Claims 5 to 14, characterised in that the two parts 
(51, 52) of the housing (5) are provided with removable side flanges 

(510,520). 
A device according to one of the preceding claims, characterised in that it 
further comprises anti-vibration means. 
A device according to one of the preceding claims, characterised in that it 
further comprises means for adjusting the compression force exerted by the 

bearing face (1, 2) on the branch (P1, P2) facing it, as a function of the 
mechanical strength of the clamp (P). 
A device according to one of the preceding claims, characterised in that the 
dimensions, profile and course of the bearing face (1, 2) are determined as a 

function of the geometry of the clamp (P) and that of the bodywork frame (B). 
A device according to one of Claims 4 to 18, characterised in that said means 
for controlling and monitoring said shoe (10, 20) comprise a motor and an 

independent power source. 
A device according to one of Claims 7 to 19, characterised in that the control 
handle (6) is connected to the housing (5) via an articulation allowing clearance 

of between 0 and 360Â°. 
Use of the device according to one of Claims 1 to 19 in a robot-operated 
system.
