<ABSTRACT>
A rotary oven conveyor apparatus is provided for 
receiving a continuous flow of articles (15) such as can ends and 

for conveying the articles (15) in an on-edge, spaced apart 
condition for a selectable predetermined period of time, to 

facilitate a treatment such as oven curing of a coating 
previously applied to the articles (15). The rotary oven 

conveyor comprises an enlarged wheel structure (10) defining an 
axis and having a diameter many times the cross-sectional 

dimensions of the articles (15) and mounted for rotation about 
its axis. A drive (30) rotates the wheel structure (10) about 

its axis. An article-receiving area (42) is defined about an 
outer periphery of the wheel structure (10) and is configured for 

partially surroundingly receiving the articles (15). A magnetic 
structure (44) is mounted adjacent the article-receiving area 

(42) for magnetically attracting articles (15) to the article-receiving 
area (42) and for maintaining articles (15) in the 

article-receiving area (42) in an on-edge, spaced apart 
condition, projecting generally radially outwardly of the 

periphery of the wheel structure (10).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention is directed generally to the 
article handling arts and more particularly to a novel and 
improved rotary type conveyor. While the rotary conveyor of the 
invention may find other applications, the following description 
will refer particularly to the use of the invention in conveying 
a plurality of articles such as can ends through a treatment 
process such as an oven in which a coating previously applied to 
the can ends is cured by exposure to air at a predetermined 
elevated temperature for a predetermined period of time. In modern can end fabrication operations, a large 
number of can ends are processed and fabricated at a relatively 
high rate. To enjoy the economies of scale possible in such a 
relatively high speed operation, it is important that the can 
ends be handled accurately and expeditiously. In this regard, 
the can ends are often conveyed from one portion or station in 
the fabricating operation to the next in a generally facewise  
 
nested condition, in a generally continuous stream or flow. In 
some instances where it is required that the can ends be handled 
in a flat condition, that is, such that their surfaces are 
exposed to be operated upon or treated in some fashion, various 
conveyor apparatus maybe utilized to convert or turn the can ends 
individually from their facewise nested condition to a flat, end-to-end 
condition, in which condition the ends may be fed along 
a further conveyor belt or the like to or past such further 
processing stations or apparatus. In particular, following the initial stamping or 
formation of the can ends from suitable aluminum or other 
metallic material or blanks, frequently a tear-away opening 
portion is formed in the can end. This is frequently 
accomplished by scoring of the material in the desired shape of 
the opening and the application of a graspable portion such as 
a pull ring or tab, or the like. This latter graspable portion 
is often applied with a rivet which extends through both the 
graspable portion and the can end. Following this scoring and tab or ring application, it 
is often desirable to apply a coating of suitable material to 
effect "repair" of the product side of the can end, for example 
to assure that the can end will maintain a seal, and to overcome 
the effect of any slight perforations or imperfection which may 
occur as a result of the scoring and application of the pull ring 
or tab. Various coatings may also be applied in accordance with 
requirements of a final end user, such as may be
