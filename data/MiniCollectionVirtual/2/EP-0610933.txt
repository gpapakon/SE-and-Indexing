<ABSTRACT>
There is disclosed a camera adapted for films 
provided with magnetic storage portions or a magnetic 

recording apparatus for the camera of the type 
described comprising first information writing means 

for writing information in a first area of a magnetic 
storage portion of the film; and second information 

writing means for writing information in a second area 
of the magnetic storage portion, the second area being 

outward the first area of the first information 
writing means, the second information writing means 

comprising means for elongating a distance to the 
second area of the magnetic storage portion of the 

film in which the second information writing means is 
capable of writing information than a distance to the 

first area of the magnetic storage portion of the film 
in which the first information writing means is 

capable of writing information.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a camera adapted for
films provided with magnetic storage portions and, in
particular, to an improvement of information writing
to the magnetic storage portion.Conventionally, U.S. Patent No. 4,977,419
discloses a color negative film including a virtually
transparent magnetic layer on a base surface of the
film, and a camera having a magnetic head for
magnetically recording information in the film or for
reading the information recorded in the film. It also
discloses to provide on outside the exposed face of
the film a plurality of recording tracks in which the
camera records information magnetically. This directs
to increase the amount of information to be recorded
for individual frames by means of increasing the number
of recording tracks.Disclosed as the information recordable by the
camera is photographing information such as the date
of photographing, time, the type of illumination light 
source used upon photographing, pseudo zoom
information, exposing time, diaphragm values or the
like.Alternatively, U.S. Patent No. 4,878,075
discloses that a filmstrip is previously provided with
film information written therein such as film
sensitivity and film regulated frame number, and that
a camera reads this information before exposure while
re-writes this information upon taking up the film
after completion of exposure to record various types
of information upon photographing.To read film information previously written in
a magnetic layer on a base side of the film or to
write photographing information in the magnetic layer
in cooperation with exposing operation by using a
magnetic head disposed in a camera, the film is
required to be transported with the magnetic head
being joined to the above mentioned magnetic layer.
With this respect, typical cameras are so structured
that a film is pinched with spring operation between
the magnetic head disposed on the base side of the
film and a pad disposed at a position opposing to said
magnetic head on the emulsion-applied surface of the
film. Accordingly, flaws or pressure marks
(sensitizing due to pressure) are caused on sliding
portions to the magnetic head because of the pressure 
required for pinching. As a result, reading of the
film information and writing of the photographing data
by the camera are made only at the peripheries of
frames out of the frames of the film.Figs. 6 and 7 are views for use describing the
above. Fig. 6 is a view illustrating operation of
magnetic recording on the film. In Fig. 6, F
represents a film

<CLAIMS>
A magnetic recording apparatus for a photographic camera adapted for a film provided with a magnetic
storage portion, said apparatus comprising:


A) first information recording means (2; 22) for recording
information on a first area (T1) of the magnetic storage portion

of the film, said first information recording means (2; 22)
generating the recording information in form of a magnetic field; and
B) second information recording means (3; 23) for recording
information on a second area (T2) of the magnetic storage

portion nearer to an edge of the film than the first area (T1),
said second information recording means,(3; 23) generating the

recording information in form of a magnetic field, said second information recording means
(3; 23) being arranged such that the recording information

protrudes farther than the recording information of said first information recording means (2; 22).
An apparatus according to Claim 1, wherein at least one
of said first and second information recording means (2, 3; 22,

23) comprises a magnetic head for use in recording information.

film; and a second current supplying means (10 to 13) for use in
recording information on said second area of said magnetic storage portion (T2)

of said film, said first current supplying means supplying
a current (I4) larger than that current (I5) supplied by

the second current supplying means.
An apparatus according to Claim 3, wherein said first and
second information recording means (2, 3; 22, 23) comprise, respectively, a
