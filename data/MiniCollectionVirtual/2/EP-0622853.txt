<ABSTRACT>
The insulated gate bipolar transistor (IGBT) integrates an 
anti-excess voltage protection function and a drain voltage 

fixing function. When a voltage is applied across the drain 
electrode and the source electrode of the IGBT to propagate a 

depletion zone from a p-n junction between a p base layer and a 
n⁻ drain layer toward inside of the n⁻ drain layer, a critical 

electric field is established that causes generation of a great 
number of electron-hole pairs due to impact ionization of 

carriers in or near the n⁻ drain layer, thereby causing 
conduction between the drain electrode and the source electrode, 

at an applied voltage lower than a drain-source voltage at 
which said depletion region reaches a p⁺ drain layer through 

the n⁻ drain layer, the applied voltage being equal to or lower 
than a critical voltage that causes generation of a great 

number of electron-hole pairs due to impact ionization of 
carriers in or near the n⁻ drain layer below a p-n junction 

between a p-type guard ring and the n⁻ drain layer.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an insulated gate bipolar
transistor (hereinafter referred to as "IGBT") integrating an
anti-excess voltage protection function and a drain voltage
fixing function.Upon turning OFF a power switching element employed as an
inverting device for a motor circuit or non-interruptible power
supply circuit, a high voltage can be induced in an inductive
load or a floating inductance in the circuit due to the abrupt
change of current flowing through the circuit. This high voltage
is applied to the power switching element as a spike voltage to
cause fatigue or breakage of the power switching element. To
protect the power switching element from excess voltage, a
voltage clamp circuit including a constant voltage diode based
on the principle of avalanche breakdown for turning ON the
constant voltage diode before breakdown occurs in the power
switching element because of applied spike voltage and thus
fixing the level of the spike voltage within a safe operation
range, is employed.When an IGBT is employed as the power switching element, a
similar means can be applied. Namely, the constant voltage diode
is externally connected between the drain and gate of the IGBT
element. However, this increases both the assembling cost and
the overall device size. It is also possible that a layer of
polycrystalline silicon is deposited on a substrate, in which
an IGBT element has been formed, and a constant voltage diode
is then formed in this polycrystalline silicon layer integrally
with the IGBT element. This increases the number of photo-masks
necessary in the element fabrication process leading to an
increase in the production cost. Furthermore, in order to form 
the constant voltage diode on the surface of the IGBT element,
it is necessary either to reduce the area of the cell region or
to increase the chip dimensions.As a solution to this problem, JP-A-1 081 270
proposes a method of
integrating a constant voltage diode, in which method the
constant voltage diode based on the principle of avalanche
breakdown is incorporated in the IGBT element so that the
constant voltage diode is interposed between the drain and the
source in an equivalent circuit. This solves the problems such
as the reduction of the chip area of the IGBT element.The proposed method provides a construction as shown in
Fig. 1, including a source electrode 51, a drain electrode 52
and a gate electrode 53. The upper portion of the construction
is composed of an insulating gate having a DSA (diffused self-aligned)
structure, a
