<ABSTRACT>
Quick connection of a tube (2) capable of being fitted into a socket (1), the said tube having, at a given distance from its end (2b), a shoulder (2c), the socket includes an annular sealing gasket (3) intended to come into contact with the tube in the zone situated between its end and the shoulder. A member (4) for locking the tube is fitted into the socket, the said member being immobilised axially relative to the socket and elastically deformable in the radial direction between an inactive configuration and an active configuration in which it bears on the shoulder (2c). A sleeve (5) is mounted so that it can slide inside the socket (1) between a first position and a second position remote from the first towards the inside of the socket. The sleeve has a limit stop (5b) located in the path of the shoulder of the tube and, in its first position, holds the locking member (4) in its inactive configuration, while the locking member is released when the sleeve is in its second position.

<CLAIMS>
A quick connection of a tube (2, 12) capable of being fitted in a 
connector (1, 11), said tube presenting, at a determined distance from its 

end (2b, 12b), a shoulder or the like (2c, 12c), whilst the connector 
comprises an O-ring (3, 13) intended to come into contact with the tube in 

the zone located between its end and the shoulder, a tube locking member 
(4, 16) is mounted in the connector and a bush (5, 17) is disposed within 

said connector, said locking member being axially immobilized with respect 
to the connector and elastically deformable in the radial direction between 

an inactive configuration and an active configuration in which it abuts on the 
shoulder of the tube opposite its end, characterized in that the bush (5, 17) 

is mounted to slide in the connector (1, 11) between a first position and a 
second position remote from the first towards the inside of the connector, 

said bush presenting a stop (5b, 17a) disposed on the path of the shoulder 
of the tube during fitting thereof in the connector and ensuring, in its first 

position, hold of the locking member (4, 16) in its inactive configuration, 
whilst, in the second position of the bush, the locking member is released 

and the axial locking of the tube (2, 12) in the connector (1, 11) may be 
checked visually. 
The quick connection according to claim 1, characterized in that 
the bush (5), preferably made of plastics material, is connected to an 

element (5d) projecting out of the connector when the bush is in its first 
position, said element being detachable and its connection with the bush 

being eliminated when the bush is in its second position. 
The quick connection according to claim 2, characterized in that 
an appropriate zone (4a) of the locking member (4) abuts axially on the 

detachable element (5d) of the bush when said member passes from its 
inactive configuration to its active configuration. 
The quick connection according to claim 1, characterized in that, 
in its second position, the inner transverse face (5a) of the bush abuts, 

directly or indirectly, on the O-ring (3) and thus imprisons it in its housing. 
The quick connection according to claim 1, characterized in that 
the locking member (16) presents two arms (16a, 16b) projecting outwardly 

of the connector (11), said arms being held by an indicator (18) when the  
 

locking member is in its inactive configuration, and released from said 
indicator when the locking member is in its active configuration.
