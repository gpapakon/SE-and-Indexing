<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to bis-aryl carbinol 
derivatives, pharmaceutical compositions and methods of using such 
derivatives. European Patent Application Publication Number 
0235463, published September 9, 1987 discloses compounds of the 
formula: 
 
wherein: Ar, D, and R can be selected from, amongst others, phenyl, 
substituted phenyl, pyridinyl, thienyl or furanyl; A can be, amongst 
others, -O-R1 wherein R1 can be, amongst others, hydrogen; Q can be 
absent because n can be zero; p can be one; m is 0 to 6 and can 
therefore be one; and B can be absent because z can be zero. International Publication Number WO 89/10369 discloses 
compounds of the formula:  
 
 
wherein: one of a, b, c and d represents nitrogen or -NR11-, wherein R11 
is, amongst others, O-, and the remaining a, b, c and d groups are CH; T 
represents carbon or nitrogen, with the dotted line attached to T 
representing an optional double bond when T is carbon; when m plus n 
equals 1 or 2, X represents, amongst others, -O- or -S(O)e- wherein e is 
0, 1 or 2; when m plus n represents 0, X can be, amongst others, any 
substituent for m plus n equalling 1 or a direct bond; when m plus n 
equals 3 then X equals a direct bond; Z represents =O or =S such that 
when Z is O, R may be, amongst others, 
 
wherein Y is N or NR11; when Z represents =S, R represents in addition 
to the R group above, aryloxy or alkoxy.  
 US 2,898,339 discloses N-substituted benzhydrol,
