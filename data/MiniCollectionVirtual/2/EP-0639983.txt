<ABSTRACT>
The invention provides an agent against HIV and/or related viruses, comprising CD4 or a CD4-like substance and an H2 histone or an H2 histone-like protein. The content of the CD4 or CD4-like substance is preferably less than the antivirally effective dose of that substance alone. The invention also provides an H2 histone or an H2 histone-like protein, for use in a method of medical treatment, in particular against HIV and/or related viruses, and also for use in the manufacture of a pharmaceutical composition against HIV and/or related viruses.

<DESCRIPTION>
 ANTIVIRAL AGENT COMPRISING CD4 AND AN H2 HISTONE.This invention relates to anti-viral agents, especially agents active against HIV-1 and related viruses.It is known that an initial stage of at least one mode of the infection of humans by RNA and DNA viruses involves attachment of the virus to the membrane of a human cell. In the case of HIV-l and HIV-2, binding is between a cell surface glycoprotein, known as CD4, and a viral envelope protein known as gpl20. Thus, CD4 acts as a cell surface receptor for the virus.After attachment of the virus to the cell membrane the replication cycle of the virus involves a series of steps, one of which appears to be fusion of the viral envelope with the cell membrane. It might be expected that fusion depends solely on binding of gpl20 to CD4. However, it is known that if the gene for human CD4 is transfected into CD4 negative HeLa cells, these cells are then rendered susceptible to productive infection by HIV-1, whereas transfection of the same gene into mouse L-cells causes these cells to bind the virus but does not allow internalisation to occur. Also, experiments with VSV(HIV) pseudotypes have shown that HIV-l binds to mouse L-cells transfected with human CD4 but is not internalised. Furthermore, it has been reported that CD4 negative cells from a wide range of human tissues can be infected by HIV- 1; such infection is not blocked by preincubation of the cells with an anti-CD4 MAb (Leu 3a) or by incubation of the virus with sCD4. These observations cause us to postulate that fusion of the virus envelope with that of a CD4 positive cell requires the involvement of at least one other cell surface receptor, a "fusion receptor".The present invention is based on our discovery that at least one such fusion receptor appears to be a cell surface protein having N-terminal homology to an H2 histone. 

The invention provides an agent against HIV and/or related viruses comprising CD4 or a CD4-like substance (for example, CD4-IgFc immunoadhesins, CD4 V1-V2 domains, andCD4-derived peptides) and an H2 histone or H2 histone-like protein. The content of CD4 or CD4-like substance may be less than (for example, less than one-half of) the anti- virally effective dose of the CD4 or CD4-like substance alone.In therapeutic use, the anti-viral agent of the invention is normally administered parenterally, for example intravenously. However, administration via the peritoneal cavity may be the most effective route in that it results in entry of at least some of the anti-HIV agent directly
