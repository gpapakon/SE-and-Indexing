<ABSTRACT>
An incident optical signal from a potential enemy threat is captured by an array of apertures (1, 16) which are connected to a number of broadband filters (21-24). The broadband filters (21-24) have overlapping band pass regions to cover the wavelength spectrum of potential threats, but not with the spectral resolution of a larger number of narrowband filters. To further increase resolution without adding additional filters, each broadband filter is connected to an optical delay line (31-34) which converts wavelength into a time delay. To enable measurement of the time delay, additional optical lines (91-94) with no relative delay are connected directly from the apertures (1-16). The time difference between when a signal arrives over optical delay lines (31-34) from the filters and when a signal arrives over optical lines (91-94) directly from the array of apertures (1, 16) is then reconverted to wavelength to a high degree of resolution.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates generally to a system of 
measuring the wavelength of an incoming signal, or 
spectral discrimination. More particularly, the 
invention relates to spectral discrimination of optical 
signals. An enemy attempting to detect and destroy an 
aircraft, tank, or ship may transmit an optical signal 
using a laser or other suitable transmitting device and 
look for a return signal much like with a radar. To 
prevent the enemy from receiving an accurate optical 
return signal, a jamming signal of the same wavelength 
may be transmitted back. To effectively transmit back a 
return signal, however, one must quickly and accurately 
determine the wavelength of the incoming signal 
transmitted by the enemy. In the past, determination of the wavelengths of 
incoming signals, or spectral discrimination, has been 
performed by using a large number of narrow band filters. 
A large number of narrowband filters, however, are 
required so that the wavelength range covered by the 
narrowband filters can cover the possible wavelength 
range of every enemy transmitter. In other words, the 
bandpass region of an individual filter has had to be  
 
small so that an incoming signal of a given wavelength can be 
identified with the wavelength range of a single filter. To achieve higher resolution, or to detect enemy signals with 
increasingly narrower wavelength ranges, an even larger number of 
narrow band (laser line) filters has been required. Wavelength 
resolution, therefore, has been controlled by the number of filters, 
and the narrowness of the filter band pass regions. US-A-4 238 141 describes a device for delaying specified 
frequencies of a multiple frequency laser beam. It does not, however, 
describe an apparatus or method for determining the wavelength spectrum 
of an incident optical signal. The present invention obtains a high resolution of wavelength 
without incorporating a narrow band filter for each wavelength to be 
detected. In other words, wavelength can accurately be resolved using 
a limited number of broad band filters. The present invention also allows wavelength detection without 
knowing the particular wavelength range of possible enemy signals for 
purposes of obtaining narrow band filters with the correct bandpass 
region. If the enemy shifts the frequency of his source signal 
slightly, presence of the signal may still be detected with the same 
resolution without the worry of the source shifting out of the narrow 
bandpass regions of a group of filters. The present invention
