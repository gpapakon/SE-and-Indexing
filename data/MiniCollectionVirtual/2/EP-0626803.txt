<ABSTRACT>
A fluid regulator comprising two valve bodies (24, 25) placed opposite and cooperating with two openings (22, 23) for controlling the fluid flow from an inlet chamber to two outlet chambers. A spindle (34) interconnects said valve bodies (24, 25) at a predetermined mutual distance forming a spindle assembly. Each valve body and each opening form a passage (30, 31), the sum of the areas of said two passages being constant, but adjustable by a handle (9). The spindle assembly is freely moveable in the axial direction under the influence of the pressures across the openings acting upon the valve bodies so that the pressure drop times the area of each opening is equal for the two openings, and dividing the fluid flow from the inlet chamber into two fluid flows to the outlet chambers. The fluid regulator is intended to be used in an agricultural sprayer for a distribution of a fluid composition to a soil to be treated. The agricultural sprayer comprises a tank (2), a pump (6), said fluid regulator, and a plurality of nozzles. The fluid regulator divides the fluid flow from the pump into a flow to the nozzles and a surplus flow back to the tank.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a fluid regulator dividing the fluid flow from a pump into a nozzle
part and a surplus part. The fluid regulator is mainly intended for regulating the spray capacity of a
agricultural sprayer.An agricultural sprayer comprises a spray ramp having a plurality of nozzles, supplying a
composition to the soil to be treated. Such composition can be a fertilizer, herbicide, fungicide,
insecticide etc.The sprayer further comprises a tank for the composition, a pump delivering the
composition to the nozzles and regulation valves for controlling the sprayer. The entire assembly is
supported by a tractor and the pump is connected to the power outlet of the tractor.The pump can be of the positive displacement pump type, in which the output is
proportional to the speed of the power output and essentially independent of pressure. In this case it
is possible to have the ramp nozzles outputting a constant dosage per squaremeter of soil by allowing
the output from the nozzles to become proportional to the power output of the tractor and thus the
speed of the tractor.Such a system is shown in the French Patent Specification No. FR-A-2 334 277. The
system comprises a fluid flow divider for dividing the fluid flow from the pump into a first flow to
the ramp nozzles and a second flow back to the tank. The flow divider is able to divide the flow very
carefully so that a predetermined proportion of the total flow is delivered to the ramp nozzles.
However; if some of the ramp nozzles are closed, the flow divider must be readjusted so that the
remaining nozzles do not receive an increased amount of the composition.Another example is shown in German Offenlegungsschrift DE-C1-33 32 189 comprising an
adjustable flow control valve and an adjustable return valve. The return valve is combined with a
pressure relief valve for avoiding any excessive pressure.The most common system used on the market today is a pressure regulator comprising an
adjustable spring loaded cone throttling against a valve seat for returning a portion of the flow to the
tank. In principal, it operates as an adjustable overflow valve and return to the tank the fluid, which
does not pass to the spray ramp.In principle, since the pressure relief valve maintains the output pressure constant to the 
ramp, the output from each nozzles should be independent of the number of nozzles connected in the
ramp, but in practice it is very difficult to manufacture a pressure relief valve which is insensitive to
fluid flow. Thus, if some of the nozzles
