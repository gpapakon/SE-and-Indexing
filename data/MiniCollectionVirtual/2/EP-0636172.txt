<ABSTRACT>
The present invention relates to engineering attenuated viruses by altering a non-coding region or the coding sequence of a viral gene. Alterations of the non-coding regions which regulate transcription and/or replication are described. These alterations result in the down-regulation of the viral gene and an attenuation of the virus, either by the production of defective particles during replication, or by reducing the number of progeny virions produced during viral replication. Alterations of viral coding sequences are also described which result in a recombinant or chimeric attenuated virus.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to engineering
attenuated viruses by altering
the coding sequence of a viral gene.
Alterations of viral coding sequences
are described which result in a recombinant or
chimeric attenuated virus.Inactivated virus vaccines are prepared by
"killing" the viral pathogen, e.g., by heat or
formalin treatment, so that it is not capable of
replication. Inactivated vaccines have limited
utility because they do not provide long lasting
immunity and, therefore, afford limited protection.
An alternative approach for producing virus vaccines
involves the use of attenuated live virus vaccines.
Attenuated viruses are capable of replication but are
not pathogenic, and, therefore, provide for longer
lasting immunity and afford greater protection. 
However, the conventional methods for producing
attenuated viruses involve the chance isolation of
host range mutants, many of which are temperature
sensitive; e.g., the virus is passaged through
unnatural hosts, and progeny viruses which are
immunogenic, yet not pathogenic, are selected.Recombinant DNA technology and genetic
engineering techniques, in theory, would afford a
superior approach to producing an attenuated virus
since specific mutations could be deliberately
engineered into the viral genome. However, the
genetic alterations required for attenuation of
viruses are not known or predictable. In general, the
attempts to use recombinant DNA technology to engineer
viral vaccines have mostly been directed to the
production of subunit vaccines which contain only the
protein subunits of the pathogen involved in the
immune response, expressed in recombinant viral
vectors such as vaccinia virus or baculovirus. More
recently, recombinant DNA techniques have been
utilized in an attempt to produce herpes virus
deletion mutants or polioviruses which mimic
attenuated viruses found in nature or known host range
mutants. Until very recently, the negative strand RNA
viruses were not amenable to site-specific
manipulation at all, and thus could not be genetically
engineered.The present invention relates to the production
of attenuated viruses using recombinant DNA
techniques. The approach for engineering
attenuated viruses  
involves engineering
alterations of a viral coding region so that the viral
protein expressed is altered by the insertion,
deletion or substitution of an amino acid residue or
an epitope and an attenuated chimeric virus, wherein the amino acids
sequence of the stalk region of the neuraminidase protein is selected from the group
consist
