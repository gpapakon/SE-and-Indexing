<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to organic
luminescent materials for EL (electroluminescent) devices
and to EL devices, and more particularly it relates to
organic luminescent materials for EL devices which
exhibit electroluminescence upon the application of a
voltage, and to EL devices which employ the above-mentioned
organic luminescent materials for EL devices.EL devices employing luminescent materials
which exhibit electroluminescence upon the application of
a voltage are conventionally used in backlights for
displays of OA machines such as word processors and for
automobile meters.Although inorganic luminescent materials have
conventionally been used as the luminescent materials for
such EL devices, high driving voltages have been required
when inorganic luminescent materials for EL devices are
caused to emit high-intensity light.Recently, therefore, research has been
conducted in regard to organic luminescent materials for
EL devices which allow lower driving voltages (see, for
example, C.W. Tang and S.A. VanSlyke: Appl. Phys. Lett.
51. 913 (1987)).Thin-film EL devices employing such organic
luminescent materials make it possible to use lower
driving voltages than with EL devices which employ the
conventional inorganic luminescent materials for EL
devices.There have also been reported organic
luminescent materials which exhibit blue luminescence,
and which may be suitably used in backlights for OA
machine displays and for automobile meters
(see, for example, Jpn. J. Appl. Phys. Vol. 32 (1993) 
L511).However, because of the inadequate luminescent
intensity of conventional organic luminescent materials
exhibiting blue luminescence, organic luminescent
materials for EL devices and EL devices have been sought
which are capable of blue luminescence of ever higher
intensities.Here, it is an object of the present invention to
provide organic luminescent materials for EL devices
which are capable of high-intensity blue or blueish green
luminescence, as well as EL devices employing them.As a result of study aimed at achieving the above-mentioned
object, the present inventors have found that
an EL device employing a 2-(O-hydroxyphenyl)-benzoxazole
or -benzothiazole zinc complex as the luminescent
material produces high-intensity blue or blueish green
luminescence upon the application of a driving voltage,
and thus the present invention has been completed.In other words, the present invention provides
organic luminescent materials for EL devices comprising a
2-(O-hydroxyphenyl)-benzoxazole or -benzothiazole
