<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a method and a system for making it easier for an elastomeric material to flow through a die. According to this method, ultrasound is used which is generated by at least one ultrasound-emitting source (10) and is propagated as far as the die (8) along a direction parallel to the axis of flow of the material through the die (8), in order to reduce friction between the material and the land (passage section) (8a) of the die (8). The invention applies especially to the manufacture of tubes or profiles by extrusion, for example rubber tubes or profiles.

Method for facilitating the flow of an elastomeric
material through a tool, such as the die of an extrusion machine

or the nozzle of an injection moulding press for example, of the
type which consists in using a plurality of ultrasound-emitting

sources (18) for propagating ultrasound in a direction parallel
to the axis on which the material flows through the tool, and in

arranging the ultrasound-emitting sources in proximity to the
tool and upstream thereof, characterized in that it consists in

interposing an acoustic insulation part (12) between the tool and

the body of the extrusion machine or of the injection moulding
press which contains the elastomeric material, and in using the

emitted ultrasound to cause only the tool of the extrusion
machine or of the injection moulding press to vibrate.
Method according to Claim 1, characterized in that it
consists in creating phase shifts between the said sources (10),

such that a helical propagation wave through the tool is
obtained.
System for implementing the method according to Claim 1
or 2, for facilitating the flow of an elastomeric material

through a tool, such as the die of an extrusion machine or the
nozzle of an injection moulding press for example, of the type

comprising a plurality of ultrasound-emitting sources (10) which
are regularly spaced around the tool (8) and upstream thereof,

the ultrasound being transmitted radially as far as a support (5)
of the tool (8) through a waveguide (13), then as far as the tool

(8) in a direction parallel to the axis on which the material
flows, characterized in that it comprises an acoustic insulation

part (12) inserted between the tool (8) and the body (2) of the
extrusion machine or of the injection moulding press.
System according to Claim 3, characterized in that each
ultrasound-emitting source (10) comprises at least one

piezoelectric ceramic in the form of a disc (10a) surrounded by
two metal discs (10b) connected to an excitation device (11).
System according to Claim 4, characterized in that the
distance between the ultrasound-emitting sources (10) and the 

tool (8) is such that a maximum amplitude of the vibrations is
obtained at the passage section (8a) of the tool (8), which

distance is a function of the frequency and of the excitation
phase of the sources (10).
System according to Claim 4 or 5, characterized in that
it comprises at least three ultrasound-emitting sources (10), and

in that a phase shift is created at the said sources in order to
produce a helical propagation wave of the vibrations propagating

all along and around the passage section (8a) of the tool (8).
Machine, such an extruder, characterized in that it is
equipped with a system as defined in any one of Claims 3 to 6,

the said system being supported by the extrusion head of the
machine.
