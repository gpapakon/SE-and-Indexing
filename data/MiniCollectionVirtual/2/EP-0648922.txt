<ABSTRACT>
An acoustically improved, air gap engine exhaust 
conduit (10) having a dual wall, air gap, metal exhaust 

conduit of an outer jacket (12) and a thin inner liner 
(14), the jacket (12) having at least one exhaust gas inlet 

and an exhaust gas outlet, the liner (14) having at least one 
inlet and an outlet, the jacket inlet and the liner inlet 

being adjacent each other, the liner (14) being secured to the 
jacket (12) adjacent the jacket inlet and the liner inlet, the 

liner outlet being optionally in engagement with the 
jacket (12), and the liner (14) otherwise being spaced from the 

jacket (12) over its length to form a continuous air gap from 
the liner inlet to the liner outlet, a pattern of 

indentation ribs (20,22) protruding into or out of the 
jacket (12) over substantially all of said jacket (12), each 

indentation rib (20,22) protruding toward or away from the liner (14), 
and terminating short of the liner (14) to be spaced from and 

not in engagement with the liner (14), to maintain the 
continuous air gap. Optionally, the liner (14) can have a 

pattern of indentation ribs protruding inwardly or 
outwardly and, if the latter, terminating short of the 

jacket (12) so as not to engage the jacket (12) and leave an air 
gap over the length thereof.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to dual wall, air gap engine 
exhaust conduits, such as exhaust pipes, downpipes, 
exhaust manifolds and the like, and more particularly to 
air gap exhaust conduits having superior acoustical 
properties and excellent thermal operational efficiency. Exhaust component technology has changed markedly 
over recent decades, from simple cast exhaust manifolds 
and ordinary steel exhaust pipe components, to 
sophisticated, lightweight and durable systems including 
catalytic converters. Lightweight stainless steel 
exhaust manifolds are replacing the heavy cast 
structures. Recent developments, as shown in US-A-5170557 
have enabled dual wall, air gap, heat durable 
steel exhaust manifolds to be readily economically 
produced. This type of manifold includes a thin inner 
liner and an outer jacket. Exhaust pipe components such 
as downpipes likewise have been developed with a thin 
inner liner and a thicker outer jacket. These thin 
liners heat rapidly from the exhaust gases after engine 
startup, to achieve quicker "light off" of the downstream 
catalytic converter. The result is a much more efficient 
system with emissions that meet federal standards. However, noise radiation is a drawback to these 
lightweight systems. Hence, efforts have been made 
heretofore to modify these systems for improving sound 
quality and reducing sound intensity. Typically, the 
prior art devices use friction to reduce noise. 
Frictional contact between the components, however, also 
involves the creation of a heat sink, i.e., thermal 
inertia, which detracts significantly from the quick 
temperature rise needed in the structure for emissions 
control.  
 Another noise control technique which was suggested 
years ago was to form an air gap to reduce noise and have 
one or both walls of a double wall conduit crimped to 
form surface deformations which served to hold one wall 
partially spaced from the other by engaging the other 
wall with the undulations or crimp areas so formed, as 
described in US-A-3 133 612. However, these very 
deformations create substantial physical contact and 
thermal exchange between the inner and outer walls along 
the length thereof. That was acceptable in the early 
1960's, but today's environmental requirements demand 
that the catalytic converter light off shortly after 
engine startup, which necessitates low heat energy 
absorption in the inner liner without creating a heat 
sink of the type that would result from the structures 
described in that patent. It has been
