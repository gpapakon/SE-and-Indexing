<ABSTRACT>
An assay and test kit for the determination of LKM-1 autoantibodies in test samples 
suspected of containing anti-LKM-1 autoantibodies. The method uses a solid phase which 

preferably is a microparticle. The method is standardized and can be performed in 
automated systems, allowing quantitation of the amount of anti-LKM antibody in test 

samples.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates generally to autoantibodies, and more particularly, relates to 
an immunoassay for the detection of liver-kidney microsomal (LKM) autoantibodies by 
automated or semi-automated means. Liver-kidney microsomal (LKM) autoantibodies are known to be associated with 
inflammatory liver diseases. LKM autoantibodies associated with idiopathic autoimmune 
chronic active hepatitis (AI-CAH) are termed "LKM-1,' autoantibodies. M. P. Manns, in 
Seminars in Liver Disease, Vol. II, No. 3:205-214(1991). The LKM-1 autoantibody has been found to recognize a 50 kilodalton (kDa) protein 
identified initially as rat liver cytochromes P450 db1 and db2, leading to the development of 
a method for determining LKM-1 in individuals. M. Gueguen et al., Biochemical and 
Biophysical Research Communications Vol. 159 (2):542-547(1989). Recent reports 
indicate that three P450 cytochromes can be identified as autoantigens in patients with 
inflammatory liver disease. All three P450 cytochromes (IA2, IID6 and IIC9) are drug 
metabolizing enzymes recognized by strongly inhibitory autoantibodies. M. P. Manns et 
al., Archives of Biochemistry and Biophysics Vol. 280 (1):229-232 (1990). Circulating autoantibodies such as LKM-1 have become important markers for 
determining the diagnosis of autoimmune hepatitis. The diagnosis of autoimmune hepatitis 
has become important, since patients suffering from autoimmune hepatitis benefit from 
treatment with immunosuppressives but not from treatment with interferons, used in the 
treatment of viral-induced hepatitis. Thus, the differentiation between viral-induced 
hepatitis and autoimmune hepatitis is important to ensure correct treatment. Recent reports 
have indicated that patients diagnosed with chronic non-A, non-B viral hepatitis (NANBH) 
by either exclusionary methods or assays for hepatitis C virus (HCV) and treated with 
interferon, actually were suffering from autoimmune hepatitis. M. Ruiz-Moreno et al., J. 
Hepatol., Vol. 12 (2).:265-266 (1991), and T. Papo et al., Annals of Internal Medicine 
Vol. 116 (1): 51-53 (1992). These recent reports have suggested that a diagnosis of 
autoimmune hepatitis should at least be considered before beginning interferon therapy, 
since this therapy is contraindicated for patients suffering from autoimmune hepatitis. Historically, methods for detection of LKM-1 autoantibodies included indirect 
fluorescent antibody (IFA) techniques, radioimmunoassay (RIA), electronmicroscopy and 
immunoblotting. M. Manns et al., J. Clin. Lab.

<CLAIMS>
A method for the determining anti-LKM autoantibody which may be present 
in a test sample, said method comprising: 


(a) incubating the test sample with an LKM specific binding member attached to 
a solid phase for a time and under conditions sufficient for LKM antigen/anti-LKM 

antibody specific binding pairs to form; 
(b) incubating with the so-formed specific binding pairs an indicator reagent 
comprising a species-specifi
c antibody attached to a signal generating compound capable of 
generating a measurable signal; 
(d) measuring the signal detected, 
 
wherein the amount of signal detected is correlated to the amount of anti-LKM antibody 

present in the test sample. 
The method of claim 1 wherein the solid phase is a suspension of 
microparticles having affixed thereto an LKM-1 antigen selected from the group consisting 

of an LKM microsome fraction or recombinant LKM-1 (cytochrome P450 db 1) amino 
acids 125-497. 
The method of claim 1 wherein the test sample is diluted prior to performing 
step (a). 
The method of claim 1 further comprising the step of separating the solid 
phase comprising LKM antigen/anti-LKM autoantibody before performing step (b) specific 

binding pairs by microparticle separation on a porous element and washing said solid 
phase. 
The method of claim 1 wherein said signal generating compound of step (b) 
is alkaline phosphatase. 
The method of claim 1 wherein said species-specific antibody is goat anti-human 
IgG. 
A test kit for performing a LKM autoantibody assay, said test kit 
comprising: 


a. a container containing LKM antigen bound to a solid phase; and 
b. a container containing an indicator reagent capable of generating a 
measurable signal. 
The test kit of claim 7 wherein said solid phase of (a) are microparticles to 
which an LKM-1 antigen selected from the group consisting of an LKM microsome 

fraction or LKM-1 cytochrome P450 db 1 amino acids 125-497. 
The test kit of claim7 wherein said indicator reagent is goat anti-human IgG 
attached to alkaline phosphatase.
