<ABSTRACT>
In an apparatus for weighing continuously flowing flowable material, in which the mass flow is determined as a function of measurements of forces exerted on at least one plate (1) in contact with the flowing material, the main novel features are that the apparatus is adapted to perform at least two of said measurements in substantial dependence of the distribution of weight, such as between third points (A, B), on a basically rectilinear inclined plate, on which the material flows slidingly. With this arrangement, the results of the measurement may be used for creating an expression of the mass flow, the accuracy of which is independent of the flow velocity, density and friction of the material.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an apparatus for weighing
a continuous stream of granular or powdery material
flowing freely under the influence of gravity, such as set
forth in the preamble of claim 1.An apparatus of the kind referred to above is disclosed
in the international patent application WO 89/11082,
corresponding to US-A-5,002,140. This known apparatus
comprises an inclined plane plate, on which the material
passes slidingly, while the weight of the amount of
material present on the plate at each instant is
registered by the force it exerts against the plate. Thus,
the weight of material being present on a known length of
plate, in connection with a measured flow velocity, is
utilized to determine the mass flow.In addition to the requirement that this velocity
measurement is to be carried out with the sufficient
precision independently of the thickness of the layer of
the flowing material (and the consequent differences in
radius from the axis of the measuring drum), it is a
prerequisite for this arrangement to function correctly,
that the flow velocity on the whole plate is uniquely
determined by the outlet velocity. This is normally not
the case, as a coefficient of friction, that is smaller or
greater than the tangent to the angle of inclination of
the plate relative to the horizontal, will cause an
acceleration or a deceleration respectively of the
material, so that the mean velocity over the plate will be
smaller or greater respectively than the outlet velocity
as measured. It is the object of the present invention to provide an
apparatus of the kind initially referred to, with which it
is possible to achieve a more accurate measurement of the
mass flow independently of the various parameter
variations reducing the accuracy of the previously known
apparatus discussed above, and this object is achieved
with an apparatus, which according to the present
invention is characterized by the features set forth in
the characterizing clause of claim 1.Thus, while the above-mentioned known weighing apparatus
does not take into account the variations in the velocity
of the material during the sliding movement on the plate,
the weighing apparatus according to the present invention
thus in fact exploits the variation in velocity from inlet
to outlet caused by friction and inclination, as the
invention is substantially based on measuring the
distribution of the material on the plate in combination
with either a measurement of the frictional force on the
latter and/or the force required to deflect the
