<ABSTRACT>
Acetic ester is produced economically by a gas phase 
carbonylation of methanol with carbon monoxide followed by a 

transesterification. Specifically, the inventive process 
comprises (a) carbonylating methanol in a gas phase with 

carbon monoxide to produce a mixture of acetic acid and methyl 
acetate; (b) separating from the production mixture the acetic 

acid, and a mixture of the methyl acetate and the co-catalyst; 
(c) further separating said methyl acetate and the co-catalyst 

and recycling the separated co-catalyst to the carbonylation 
reactor; (d) introducing the separated methyl acetate into a 

lower region of a transesterification reactor at a temperature 
of above its boiling point; (e) introducing an C₂ or higher 

alcohol into an upper region of the trans-esterification 
reactor at a temperature of up to its boiling point; (f) 

transesterifying the methyl acetate with the alcohol in the 
presence of an acid catalyst to produce a mixture containing 

acetic esters; and (g) recovering the acetic esters from the 
mixture as a bottom product while recycling the unreacted 

methyl acetate and methanol to the carbonylation reactor or 
distillation column.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a process for preparing
acetic esters from methyl acetate selectively obtained by a
gas phase carbonylation of methanol.Acetic esters including alkyl acetate have been widely
employed as solvents and plasticizers. Specifically, ethyl
acetate, propyl acetate, butyl acetate, isobutyl acetate,
isoamyl acetate and the like with a low molecular weight are
frequently used as a solvent for lacquers, paints, warnishes,
adhesives, etc.; and such acetates as dioctyl phthalate,
dibutyl phthalate, and butyl oleate of a high molecular weight
are largely used as a plasticizer.Acetic esters have generally been prepared by an
esterification of acetic acid with an alcohol. However, in
such esterification, in order to increase the conversion rate,
the desired ester product should be removed from the reaction
system as the esterification proceeds because the
esterification is reversible.Method of recovering the desired ester varies, depending
on a number of factors such as the difference in the boiling
point of the alcohol and the resulting ester, the formation of 
an azeotrope between the alcohol and water, which is produced
during the esterification, or between the ester and water, and
so forth. When the boiling point of the resulting ester is
lower than that of the corresponding alcohol, it may be
readily removed from the reaction product. However, when the
boiling point of the resulting ester is equal to or higher
than that of the alcohol, its removal process may become
rather complex.For example, ethyl acetate forms a two-component
azeotrope with water, and a three-component azeotrope with
ethanol and water (ethyl acetate:ethanol:water = 83%: 9%: 8%).
Processes for producing ethyl acetate using such properties
in a batch or continuous system are disclosed in U.S. Patent
Nos. 1,425,624; 1,425,625; 1,454,462 and 1,454,463 assigned to
U.S. Industrial Alcohol Co.FR-A-2 022 110 discloses a process for the preparation of
carboxylic acids and esters from methanol and carbon monoxide; a
pre-treatment of carbon monoxide is not mentioned or suggested in
this reference. CH-A-459 971 refers to a process for the transesterifiaction
of methyl esters of organic acids, which
transesterifiaction can be carried out in a vapour phase.Recently, a reactive distillation process has been
developed as an improved process, which comprises introducing
a high boiling acidic liquid catalyst at the top of the
distillation column, and distilling the resulting reaction
mixture while carrying out the reaction on

the co-catalyst as a low boiling fraction thereof;
