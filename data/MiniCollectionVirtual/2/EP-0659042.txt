<ABSTRACT>
A reversible plough, preferably of the semi-mounted type, comprises a main beam (11), coupling means (12) at the forward end of the beam (11), a carrying beam (16) having pairs of plough bodies (17) mounted along its length and pivotally connected to the main beam (11) to move between first and second ploughing positions for plough body reversal, a coupling beam (19) secured to the carrying beam (16) and projecting laterally therefrom in either ploughing position and movable with the carrying beam (16) during plough body reversal, and a soil preparation device e.g. packer (20) engageable with the soil turned over by the plough bodies (17) to prepare the soil for seed. A hopper (22) is mounted, or adapted to be mounted, at a fixed location relative to the plough/packer combination, and a distributor (23) is mounted on the packer (20) and arranged to distribute the hopper contents onto the ground. The hopper contents are conveyed via a flexible distribution system including line (25) extending between hopper (22) and the distributor (23).

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a reversible plough which is
adapted to be towed behind a tractor or other propelling
vehicle and which comprises a main beam, coupling means at the
forward end of the main beam to couple the plough to the rear
of the propelling vehicle, and a carrying beam having pairs of
plough bodies mounted along its length and pivotally connected
to the main beam for movement between first and second
ploughing positions, in one of which one plough body of each
pair is in a ploughing position and in the other of which the
other plough body of each pair is in the ploughing position.Reversible ploughs are usually (1) of the fully mounted
type, in which the major part of the weight of the plough is
borne by the rear lift mechanism of a tractor, or (2) of the
semi-mounted type in which the weight of the forward part only
of the plough is borne by the rear lift mechanism, whereas the
rear part of the plough is supported by one or more ground
wheel.The present invention has been developed primarily in
connection with a reversible plough of the semi-mounted type,
and the preferred embodiment which will be described with
reference to the accompanying drawings is also of this type.
However, it should be understood that the invention is not
restricted solely to a plough of the semi-mounted type, and may
be applied also to a fully mounted reversible plough.Semi-mounted ploughs often are of substantial length, so
that a considerable number of furrows can be ploughed during
each pass along the field, and to further increase the number
of furrows, the plough may have a forward section coupled
directly to the rear of the tractor, and a rear section coupled
with the forward section and carrying a further set of
reversible plough bodies, and the arrangement is such that both
the forward section and the rear section can undergo joint
movement during each reversal of the plough.It is also known to use soil preparation devices, such as
harrows and packers, to break down the soil turned over during 
ploughing, and this can take place either (1) as a separate
operation after ploughing has been completed or (2)
simultaneously with the ploughing operation in the case of
plough / soil preparation combinations (see DE-A-3333748).Packers are often used in plough / packer combinations,
and comprise heavy packer wheels arranged in sets, or toothed
rolls; and these are heavy and robustly constructed, comprising
rolling masses of high inertia so as to exert a sufficient
crumbling force to break down clods of soil to form

a main beam (11);
coupling means (12) at the forward end of the main beam
(11) to couple the plough to the rear of the propelling

vehicle;
a carrying beam (16) having pairs of plough bodies (17)
mounted along its length and pivotally connected to the main

position and a second ploughing position in which the other
plough body (17) of each pair is in the ploughing position;

being movable with the carrying beam (16) during each pivotable

adjustment of the carrying beam (16) between the first and
second ploughing positions;
a soil preparation device (20) engageable with the soil
turned-over by the plough bodies (17) in order to prepare the

soil to receive seed;
a swivel connection (21) which mounts the soil
preparation device (20) on the coupling beam (19), in which the

swivel connection (21) (1) allows the soil preparation device
(20) to engage the ground in either ploughing position; (2) is

effective to transmit load during operation from the plough to
the soil preparation device (20) to increase the effectiveness

of the latter; and (3) permits the soil preparation device (20)
to be lifted from the ground on one side of the main beam (11),

to move laterally, and then to be lowered to the ground on the
other side of the main beam (11) during each reversal of the

plough bodies (17); characterised by

fixed location relative to the plough / soil preparation device

combination, and serving to store seed and / or fertiliser;
