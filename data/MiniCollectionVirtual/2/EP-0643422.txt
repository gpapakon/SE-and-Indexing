<ABSTRACT>
A high-energy pulse protection device (10) protects an integrated 
circuit (28 and 30). The integrated circuit (28 and 30) associate with an 

integrated circuit substrate region (64). The high-energy pulse protection 
device (10), has a protection circuit substrate region (74) that is disassociated 

from the integrated circuit substrate region (64). A primary protection circuit 
(40 and 42) associate with the protection circuit substrate region (74) and has 

at least one connection (22) with the integrated circuit (28 and 30) for 
receiving and dissipating through the at least one connection (22) a high-energy 

pulse. This protects the integrated circuit (28 and 30) from the high-energy 

pulse.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention generally relates to integrated circuits and,
more particularly, to a method and system for protecting integrated circuits
against a variety of electrical transients.Integrated circuits are used in a variety of environments including
harsh ones that can seriously deter the integrated circuit's proper operation.
In general, the phenomena known as electrostatic discharge (ESD) and
electrical overstress (EOS) can affect and, in some cases, prohibit the
functioning of integrated circuits. ESD may be thought of as high-energy
pulse that occurs whenever someone or something carrying an electrical
charge touches the integrated circuit. In EOS, a voltage spike of a longer
duration exists. An example of EOS occurs when a system is improperly
tested or during improper operation of an electrical system that causes a
large voltage spike to enter the integrated circuit. In some even harsher
environments, such as that of an automobile, a phenomenon known as "load
dump" may occur. An example of the load dump electrical transient happens
when a battery cable disconnects from the battery terminal as a result of the
car hitting a bump or experiencing some other jolt. The disconnected battery
cable, if connected to the alternator, may contact a component such as an
engine control circuit that has an embedded integrated circuit. This battery
cable contact dumps the energy from the alternator into the integrated circuit
and can destroy its proper operation.Integrated circuits that protect against ESD often use on-chip
protection at the input and output pins. Protection devices that protect 
against ESD may protect against high-energy pulses of up to
15 kilovolts. On-chip protection device designs for pulses
having magnitudes beyond this level are not possible due to
practical limits of size on the integrated circuit chip.
Circuits that address the EOS and load dump situations may
use a metal oxide veristor (MOV) device to absorb the high-energy
pulse. MOV devices, however, are bulky and expensive
to implement for all integrated circuits that may require
protection. The heat that the known protection devices
produces also impairs performance of integrated circuits as
the temperature rises in the associated silicon substrate
region.US-A 4 920 405 discloses an over-current protection
circuit for a bipolar transistor. A pair of diodes is
connected in series between the base and emitter of the
transistor, and a resistor is placed in the emitter lead.
When the emitter current through the resistor exceeds a
