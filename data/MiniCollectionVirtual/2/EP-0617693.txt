<DESCRIPTION>
This invention pertains to an apparatus for 
separating a predetermined sheet from an array of sheets 
on a conveyor. Widestock rolls of web, such as film or paper, 
frequently are cut into sheets suitable for use by a 
customer, typically by first slitting the wide rolls 
into narrow rolls and then chopping the film from the 
narrow rolls into sheets. When the slitting and 
chopping steps are performed on a widestock roll 
substantially simultaneously, an array of sheets having 
transverse rows and longitudinal lanes is transported on 
a conveyor to a station which stacks the individual 
sheets for packaging. Typically, in the case where the 
web is coated, the array of sheets is inspected for 
defects which occurred during the coating or finishing 
operation, and defective sheets are separated therefrom. 
In addition, sheets from the array may be separated for 
sampling purposes. Furthermore, there may be a desire 
to randomly combine or shuffle equally sized sheets from 
different lanes into stacks of sheets which are selected 
from a variety of different parts of the web. A problem 
arises when one sheet in the array has a defect or needs 
to be separated from the array for any purpose. In the 
past, the entire transverse row or crosscut of sheets  
 
containing the defective sheet would be separated. This 
separating of additional sheets results in much 
reworking of the separated sheets and possible waste of 
acceptable, i.e., defect-free, material. One method which is particularly adapted to 
handling articles of this nature is to transport the 
array of sheets by means of a conveyor comprising an 
endless, perforated belt which moves by means of drive 
rolls and idler rolls. Typically, such a conveyor 
includes a vacuum box having an apertured portion about 
which the perforated belt moves. By this means, the 
array of sheets that have been positioned on the 
conveyor will be securely transported by the vacuum from 
the slitting and chopping location to the stacking 
location. If the sheets are flexible, limber, or 
relatively lightweight, such as photographic film 
sheets, there is a problem when diverting sheets from 
one vacuum conveyor to another for separating, 
shuffling, stacking, or special handling, in that a 
lightweight sheet is easily displaced by air currents, 
so accurate location of the sheet is difficult to 
maintain and sheet damage is possible. This is 
particularly true when the sheet is transported at high 
speed. There is a need to reliably transfer a single 
lightweight
