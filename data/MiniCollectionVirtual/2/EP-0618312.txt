<ABSTRACT>
A process for obtaining N-acetyl homocysteine 
thiolactone of the formula (I) from DL-homocystine by 

electrochemical methods. An aqueous solution of DL-homocystine 
and a mineral acid are submitted to 

electrolysis in an electrolytic cell with the catholyte 
and anolyte separated. The catholyte consists of the 

above solution and the anolyte can be any saline 
solution. The electrodes can be flat, or three-dimensional, 

forming a compact or fluidized bed. The 
current tension is between 10 mA/cm² and 2 A/cm²; the 

temperature is comprised between 0 and 90°C . The 
solution obtained in the catholyte is concentrated, 

dried and acetylated to obtain the compound (I), with a 
high degree of purity. 
The compound of the invention can be used for the 
therapy of liver complaints and as a mucolytic.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention refers to a general process for obtaining 
N-acetyl homocysteine thiolactone (cythiolone) of the 
formula (I). 
In the chemical literature we find processes for 
obtaining this product industrially that are protected 
by patents. Some methods are based on reaction with sodium and 
liquid ammonia from N-acetyl methionine. 
(German patent DE 1.134.683)
 
or from methionine 
(Japanese patent JP 1.376) to eliminate the methyl group 
and later cycling, or acetylation and cycling, to obtain  
 
cythiolone. These processes use an expensive and dangerous 
technology, as they involve the handling of liquid 
ammonia under pressure and/or at low temperature 
(-50°C), and the addition of metal sodium with the 
drawbacks and dangers that this involves. By treating the methionine in sulfuric acid we obtain 
DL-homocystine. 
This can be reduced with tin and hydrochloric acid 
(Journal of Biological Chemisty, 112, p. 149, 1935-36) 
or with zinc in acetic acid (Japanese patent JP 3.420) 
to give homocysteine thiolactone 
which when acetylated according to usual methods gives 
cythiolone. These processes involve the use of metals in acid  
 
medium, in which hydrogen is produced. These reactions 
are dangerous as this release of hydrogen is difficult 
to control, and they leave metal residues that are 
difficult to eliminate or recycle whereby the 
environment is damaged. Different methods of acetylation of homocysteine 
thiolactone are described in several patents (Japanese 
patent JP 16.712 and French patents FR 2.147.468 and 
2.219.877). The process according to the invention is characterized 
fundamentally in that it makes the DL-honiacystine react 
electrochemically in acid medium in order to obtain a 
salt of homocystine thiolactone 
which when acetylated by suitable methods gives 
cythiolone. 
The process that is the object of the present invention 
is particularly suitable for industrial application 
whereby it should be noted in comparison with prior art  
 
that it is an easily controllable method and that it 
does not leave residues that deteriorate the 
environment, as the raw material used is the electric 
current. Homocysteine thiolactone is obtained electrochemically 
by electroreduction in a medium composed of acid water 
of DL-homocystine. The system of electrosynthesis is formed by one or 
several cathodes which can be made of : graphite, tin, 
zinc, lead, mercury, copper, titanium, platinum, 
platinized titanium or any steel or an alloy containing 
iron, and by one or several anodes made
