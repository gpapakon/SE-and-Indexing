<ABSTRACT>
A lengthy continuous textile product is serially 
treated with an aqueous liquid containing a 

thermoplastic resin and thermochromic and/or photochromic 
microcapsules having a volume-based median diameter of 0.5µ 

m to 15 µ m by padding. The textile product is colored with the 
reversibly color changing microcapsules without the tailing 

and reverse tailing phenomena.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method of coloring a 
lengthy continuous textile product with reversibly color 
changing microcapsules, and a colored product made thereby. Previously, the present inventors proposed a method of 
efficiently coloring a lengthy continuous textile product 
with a reversibly color changing material wherein the 
reversibly color changing material is carried on the 
textile product by padding after the product is treated 
with a cationic nitrogenous compound (Japanese Patent 
Application No. 60959/1993). Although the above-mentioned coloring method is very 
useful for industrial application in that reversibly color 
changing materials can be applied to textile products by 
padding, an approach that has been thought to be impossible 
for some reasons including longitudinally ununiform 
coloring, it involves multiple steps because of the 
necessity for a separate pretreatment with a nitrogenous 
cationic compound, a step not needed in ordinary 
practice of padding. In addition, the nitrogenous cationic compound, 
originally used to prevent the reverse tailing phenomenon  
 
in padding operation, can result in the tailing phenomenon 
owing to excess acceleration of adhesion of non-vehicle 
components (i.e. components which are in the padding bath 
and are not vehicle or do not act as vehicle) such as reversibly 
color changing materials, depending on kind of textile product 
and kind of nitrogenous cationic compound. The object of the present invention is to provide a 
method of uniformly and efficiently coloring a lengthy 
continuous textile product with reversibly color changing 
microcapsules by padding without the tailing and reverse 
tailing phenomena, and a colored product made thereby. The present inventors found that the above-described 
tailing and reverse tailing phenomena occur with very 
strong dependency on the size of various particles which 
are non-vehicle components in the padding bath. Through 
further investigations, the inventors found it possible to 
use reversibly color changing microcapsules whose particle 
size fall within a particular range to obtain a reversibly 
color changing colored product uniformly colored with said 
microcapsules as a result of prevention of the reverse 
tailing phenomenon and also the tailing phenomenon even 
without pretreatment with a nitrogenous cationic compound, 
and developed the present invention. Accordingly, the 
coloring method of the present invention is characterized 
in that a lengthy continuous textile product is
