<ABSTRACT>
An ambulatory infusion and/or KVO (keep vein open) system (12, 18) has a gas-pressurized bladder arrangement (12) including a gas barrier associated therewith. The system includes a flexible bag of solution (13) inserted in a sleeve portion (36) of the bladder arrangement (12). Internal gas pressure which is developed within the bladder arrangement by a selectively initiated chemical reaction exerts a continuing pressure against the solution bag (13) to cause the solution to flow therefrom. A tubing set (18) of the system includes a flow restrictor (24) which is sized for minimal flow rates for indwelling catheter patency maintenance.

<DESCRIPTION>
 AMBULATORY ENERGIZED CONTAINER SYSTEMBACKGROUND OF THE INVENTIONThere are many patients on intermittent I.V. medication who are healthy enough to be more freely ambulatory if it were not necessary for them to be tied down to a hospital or clinic so that patency in their venipuncture sites could be maintained by means of a standard in-hospital KVO (keep vein open) therapy or lengthy, relatively involved heparin or saline lock therapies requiring flushing of the patient's venipuncture site before and after each administration of medication, which therapies are relatively costly and result in a large volume of waste to be disposed of. Although some ambulatory KVO therapies have been tried, none have been able to successfully maintain the necessary positive pressure, continuous fluid flow patency for a long enough period to make their use worthwhile.An object of the invention is to provide a new ambulatory energized container KVO system which is effective for an advantageous period of time.Another object of the invention is to provide a new ambulatory self-energized KVO system which is lightweight and which is disposable in its entirety after being used.A further object of the invention is to provide a new ambulatory energized container system having a combination bladder and sleeve member which while being flexible, maintains an enhanced degree of structural integrity while being pressurized for an extended period of time, for example for greater than 48 hours.An additional object of the invention is to provide a new design for construction of a new combination sleeve and bladder member of an energized container system of the 

invention, which design is advantageously forgiving of deviations from manufacturing specifications during lamination procedures involved in construction of the combination sleeve and bladder member.Other objects of the invention will become apparent to the reader infra.SUMMARY OF THE INVENTIONThe present invention is for an ambulatory energized container system suitable for developing a continuous pressure on, and flow of, a solution from a flexible bag for solution into a patient's indwelling vein access device, for example sufficient for keeping the patient's vein open even though medication may be administered through the access device only intermittently. The ambulatory energized container system comprises a combination sleeve and bladder member (combination member). The combination member has a bladder portion and a sleeve portion. A flexible bag for solution can be inserted
