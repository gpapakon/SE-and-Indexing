<ABSTRACT>
An injection syringe slot 28 for holding a tip of a syringe 30 detachably is 
formed on a case 2. A pair of shafts 4 and 6 connected to a rotary drive device 

is journalled on the case 2, and a plurality of elongate electrodes 8 
and 10 are fixed to each of the shafts 4 and 6 at a predetermined interval. 

Each electrode 8 of the shaft 4 of one side forms a pair with each electrode 
10 of the shaft 6 of the other side which is opposed to each other with a 

difference in level in axial direction, and a plurality of sets of a pair of 
electrodes are set so that the opposite interval of a pair of electrodes of 

a lower level is narrower than the opposite interval of a pair of electrodes 
in upper level. When a pair of electrodes 8 and 10 of the lowest level abuts 

on the needle 42, this pair of electrodes 8 and 10 is shortcircuited to cause 
a spark phenomenon, and the portion of the needle 42 abutting on the electrodes 

8 and 10 melts and is cut off. When the needle 42 is cut off, a pair 
of electrodes 8 and 10 of this cut portion oscillates mutually in the crossing 

direction, and then, a pair of electrodes 8 and 10 of next upper level 
abuts on the needle 42.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a device for disposing injection needles in which 
used injection needles for medical treatment melt by means of sparks according to the 
preamble of claim 1. Many applications have been filed for devices for disposing injection needles by 
means of discharge, heat melting and the like and they have already become prior art. In the US - A - 5,138,124, a device for destructing used injection needles is disclosed 
in which an injection syringe is retained by hand, and a tip of the injection needle is 
urged against one of two rotating electrodes, and the injection needle melts by means 
of sparks. Also, in the US - A - 4,628,169, a structure of a device for destructing injection needles 
is disclosed in which an injection needle of an injection syringe is inserted into an 
elongate injection syringe slot while holding the injection syringe by hand, and the 
injection syringe is caused to slide along a longitudinal direction of the injection syringe 
slot while holding the injection syringe by hand, and the injection needle melts 
at its tip by sparks flying up between electrodes. Also, in the JP - A - 2-52652 which forms the next coming prior art, a device for disposing 
injection needles is disclosed in which a plurality of electrodes are simultaneously 
caused to make contact with the injection needle, and voltage of a predetermined 
level is applied to the injection needle through the plurality of electrodes, 
and the temperature of the injection needle is elevated by a resistance heat up to cut 
off the injection needle at an optional number of locations of the injection needle. Each of the devices disclosed in the above-noted US - A - 5,138,124 and US - A - 
4,628,169 requires an attachment of the injection needle to the electrodes during the 
melting of the injection needle tip while an operator helds the injection syringe by 
hand.  
 For this reason, the injection needle disposing operation is not easy, and moreover, 
the vibration of the sparks at the tip of the injection needle is transmitted to the hand 
which gives uncomfortable feeling on the part of the operator. Also, the device according to JP - A - 2-52652 for cutting the injection needle with 
heat melting while the plurality of electrodes are simultaneously in contact with the 
injection needle requires a structure of causing the plurality of electrodes to make 
contact with the injection needle simultaneously, and its structure becomes complicated. Furthermore, a system of causing the plurality of
