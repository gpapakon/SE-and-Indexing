<CLAIMS>
A lock with a cam (4) and with automatic return, of the type comprising a rotor 
(2) turning in a stator (1) under the action of a key, the said stator being integral with 

a wall to be locked, the said cam (4) being mounted with angular play at the end of the 
rotor (2) opposite to the keyhole, the rotor (2) being returned relative to the stator (1) 

by means of a torsion spring (3), characterized in that the said cam (4) has a detent 
nose (9) cooperating with a projection (5) on the stator (1) and in that means for 

causing the cam (4) to rotate independently of the lock can act on the cam from the 
exterior to move it from its locking position into a detent position of engagement with 

the projection (5), which position corresponds to disablement of the lock, to keep the 
cam in an unlocked position, even when the rotor (2) is in the locking position, the 

angular displacement of the cam (4) from the locking position to the detent position 
being greater than the angular displacement of the cam from its locking position to its 

angular position of unlocking in the sense for opening the lock. 
A lock according to claim 1, characterized in that the detent nose (9) of the 
cam (4) is rigid and the projection (5) is elastically deformable. 
A lock according to claim 1, characterized in that the detent nose (9) of the
