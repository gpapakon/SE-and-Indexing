<ABSTRACT>
A probe (1) for making electrical connections to the legs (3) 
of an already mounted integrated circuit (4) carries rows (2) of 

tapered wedges (8). The wedges within a row are spaced apart by an 
amount that corresponds to the width of the IC's legs. For n-many 

legs on a side of the IC there are n + 1 corresponding wedges, 
which then have n-many intervening spaces. As the positioned 

probe is pressed down the spaces between the wedges receive the 
legs of the IC, and wedges become wedged between the IC's legs. 

Each wedge has left and right conductive surfaces (22) separated by 
an insulator (19,20,21). Each leg of the IC has a wedge to its 

left and a wedge to it right. Within the probe the right-hand 
conductive surface of the wedge to the left of a leg, and the lefthand 

conductive surface of the wedge to the right of that leg, are 
electrically connected together. Thus, the probe makes electrical 

contact to each leg in two places. The tapered wedges are of Ni- 
and Au-plated BeCu separated by acrylic adhesive and Kapton. 

Acrylic adhesive and Kapton are also used as the spacer between 
wedges. The rows of wedges (48-51) are cemented to a mantle (52). 

A lead frame (59) soldered to the butt end of the wedges connects 
opposing surfaces of adjacent wedges and makes the interconnection 

between the rows of wedges and an array of pins (61) in a pin block 
(60) at the top of the probe. Sticks of coplanar wedges are made 

by laminating layers of material in a press. The taper of the 
wedge
 tip arises from layers of shorter length in conjunction with 
a shaped surface in the laminating press N + 1 sticks are laminated 

together with intervening spacers to form a stack from which rows 
of n + 1 wedges may be removed.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to apparatus for connecting
test equipment to legs of an integrated circuit.The measurement of electrical signals on the leads or legs of an integrated circuit (IC)
package, or the application of external electrical stimulation to the legs of an IC, has become
increasingly problematic with the continued decrease in the size of the legs and the space
therebetween, coupled with increasing numbers of legs on a package. The circuit probing techniques
originated for use with test equipment such as voltmeters and oscilloscopes are simply impractical
for use with surface mount components of half-millimeter or less lead pitch. Increasingly, the task
of connecting logic analyzers, timing analyzers, emulators and automatic board testers to surface
mounted integrated circuits is becoming mechanically difficult, less reliable and definitely more
expensive.As the size of the legs and their intervening space decreases, a number of problems are
exacerbated. Because of the legs' smaller size, there is less contact surface, and what there is of it
may be coated with a residue of solder resist or flux. Contact mechanisms such as the one disclosed in US-A-5 015946, that rely upon making
contact with the outer face of the legs run the risk of poor contact either because of poor wiping
action against the leg by the corresponding contact in the probe or because of insufficient contact
pressure. Alignment is becoming increasingly critical, with the associated risk that the probe's
contacts may short adjacent legs together. To ensure that the probe does not fall off inadvertently,
some manufacturers are equipping their IC probes with grippers that engage the corners of the IC
package. These grippers have to be replaceable because they are easily broken.A further problem arises with conventional probes: They tend to have a bigger "footprint"
than the IC's they probe, and as those IC's get smaller, the footprints do not scale down as fast in
size as do those IC's. Thus, as the density of circuit boards increases so does the problem of
interference between a probe for an IC and the components adjacent that IC.The present invention seeks to provide improved connection
apparatus.According to an aspect of the present invention, there is
provided apparatus for connecting test equipment to legs of an
integrated circuit as specified in claim 1.The preferred embodiment is directed to 
wedging a strip of conductive material between adjacent legs of an IC. If one side of the material
is backed by an insulator
