<DESCRIPTION>
 DESCRIPTIONUSE OF RENIN INHIBITORS FOR THE TREATMENT OF GLAUCOMATechnical FieldGlaucoma is a condition characterized by an increase in intraocular pressure. Increased intraocular pressure can lead to optic nerve damage and defects in the visual field. .Blindness can result if the condition is left untreated.This invention relates to new use of amino acid derivatives which inhibit renin for treating glaucoma or reducing and/or controlling intraocular pressure.Accordingly, this invention provides new use of said amino acid derivatives for treating glaucoma or reducing and/or controlling intraocular pressure.Further, this invention provides an agent and a pharmaceutical composition for treating glaucoma or reducing and/or controlling intraocular pressure, which comprises said amino acid derivatives.Still further, this invention provides a method for treating glaucoma or reducing and/or controlling intraocular pressure, which comprises administering said amino acid derivatives to mammals.Background ArtThe amino acid derivatives used in this invention ar known as renin inhibiting compounds and disclosed in European Patent Publication No. 300189.It has been disclosed (for example, in WO-87/02581, EP-A-0311012) that renin inhibitors are useful for treating glaucoma, but there is still a need for useful methods and compositions for treating glaucoma or reducin 

 and/or controlling intraocular pressure,Disclosure of the InventionThe amino acid derivatives used in this invention can be represented by the following general formula [I].wherein Rl is lower alkyl optionally substituted with a substituent selected from the group consisting of acyl, hydroxy, lower alkoxy, aryl, lower alkylthio and a group of the formula :in which R-5 is hydrogen or acyl andR^ is hydrogen or lower alkyl; aryl; or amino optionally substituted with substituent(s) selected from the group consisting of lower alkyl and acyl; andR2 is hydrogen or lower alkyl; orRl and R2 are taken together with the attached nitrogen atom to form a heterocyclic group optionally substituted with substituent(s) selected from the group 

 consisting of lower alkyl, hydroxy(lower)alkyl, lower alkoxy(lower)alkyl, acyl(lower)alkyl, oxo and acyl; R-3 is hydrogen or lower alkyl; and R4 is lower alkyl; and its pharmaceutically acceptable salt.The term "lower" is intended to mean a group having to 7 carbon atom(s), unless otherwise provided.Suitable "lower alkyl" may be a straight or branched one such as methyl, ethyl, propyl, isopropyl, butyl, isobutyl, tert-butyl,
