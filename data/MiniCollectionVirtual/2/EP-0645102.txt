<ABSTRACT>
Closure device particularly for sports shoes including 
a shell (2) and a quarter (3) and provided with a first flap 

(4a,4b) and a second flap (5a,5b) to be secured or with 
straps to be tensioned and secured. The device includes grip 

elements (7) and at least one engagement element (12) which 
are associable respectively with the first flap and with the 

second flap, or with the shoe and with the band. The grip 
elements selectively and detachably interact with the 

engagement element by using an auxiliary lever (16). The 
device has low manufacturing costs, allowing to standardize 

the individual components and limiting protrusions with 
respect to the surfaces of the shoe.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a closure device
particularly for sports shoes comprising a shell and/or at
least one quarter provided with a first flap and a second
flap to be secured, or with straps to be tensioned and
secured.Various devices are currently known which allow to
close a first flap and a second flap of sports shoe, such
as for example a ski boot.Such devices are usually constituted by a lever that
comprises a lever body which is pivoted transversely, at one
end, at two shoulders that protrude from a base which is
rigidly coupled to one of the flaps to be joined.Said lever body can have, at one of its surfaces,
several teeth between which it is possible to engage for
example the end of a ring the other end of which is rigidly
coupled to the other flap to be joined.As an alternative, a ring may be pivoted transversely
to the lever body, while the other end of the ring is
selectively associated at a tooth of a rack which is rigidly
coupled to the other flap to be joined.Devices are also known wherein the arm of the lever is
essentially U-shaped, with a bar pivoted between its arms,
and wherein a traction element, such as for example a cable,
is associated with one end of said bar. The other end of the
traction element is associated for example with a ring that
selectively interacts with a rack.These and other conventional devices essentially have
the drawback of being constituted by several components
which increase their total cost, also bearing in mind the 
fact that for some shoes, such as for example ski boots or
ice skates or roller skates, it is necessary to have
multiple closure devices.In these last cases, it is also necessary to use
closure devices which have components with slightly
different dimensions, because during securing it is
necessary to compensate for a varying amount of space
between the flaps to be joined, and to avoid interference
between the levers and the ground, in particular for the
levers securing the shell portion of the boot.Therefore, in ski boots and skates, the use of levers
at the toe area always entails closure difficulties, as the
levers have rather small dimensions, to avoid protruding
excessively outside the shell and the user can hardly grip
them.Furthermore, in known closure devices the lever arms
are subject to possible accidental impacts during sports
practice which either damage the device or open it.Furthermore, the use of metal to manufacture these
conventional closure devices increases the weight and total
cost of the shoe.US-A-4 250 595 and

Closure device, particularly for sports shoes
comprising a shell (2) and at least one quarter (3) provided

with a first flap (4a,4b) and a second flap (5a,5b) to be
secured or with a strap to be tensioned and secured, the

closure device comprising grip elements (7), an auxiliary lever
(16) and at least one engagement element (12), said grip elements (7) being

associated with said first flap or with said sports shoes
and selectively and detachably interact, by means of said

auxiliary lever (16) detachable from said sports shoe, with
at least one engagement element (12) being associated

with said second flap or with said strap, the closure device
being 
characterized in that
 said auxiliary lever (16) comprises a
pivoting lever arm (17) and a traction element (18)

connected to said pivoting lever arm (17) such that said traction
element (18) is engageable with said engagement element (12) while

simultaneously a pivoting action of said lever arm
selectively enables the selection of one of a plurality of

engagement positions between said grip and engagement
elements (7,12).
Device according to claim 1, characterized in that
each of said grip elements comprises a base (8) which is

associated proximate to said first flaps (4a,4b) or with
said shoe, multiple mutually parallel first seats (10) being

provided transversely on said base.
Device according to claim 2, characterized in that a
hole is formed at each one of said first seats (10).
Device according to claim 2, characterized in that a
first tab (11) protrudes towards the facing surface of said

first flaps.
Device according to claim 4, characterized in that 
said engagement element (12) is constituted by a pawl which

has a first tooth (14) directed towards said first flaps or
said shoe.
Device according to claim 5, characterized in that
the dimensions of said first tooth (14) are approximately

equal to those of said first seats (10) of said base (8).
Device according to claim 6, characterized in that a
second tooth (15) is provided on the opposite side with

respect to said first tooth (14) on said at least one
engagement element (12), said second tooth protruding in the

opposite direction with respect to the surface of said
second flaps (5a,5b).
Device according to one or more of the preceding
claims, characterized in that said traction element is in

the form of a ring (18) which can temporarily engage the
surface of said second tooth (15) at its free end and which

is associated in an intermediate position with said lever
arm (17).
Device according to claim 8, characterized in that
two shoulders (19a,19b) are pivoted transversely at one end

of said lever arm (17) and protrude at right angles with
respect to a freely movable wing (20) which is essentially

L-shaped.
Device according to claim 9, characterized in that
the larger portion (21) of said wing (20) oscillates

partially below said lever arm (17), protrudes beyond the
axis for pivoting to said lever arm, and is joined to a

smaller portion (22) which is directed opposite to the free
end of said lever arm (17).
Device according to claim 10, characterized in that 
said smaller portion (22) of said wing (20) forms a third

tooth which can be selectively located at one of said first
seats.
Device according to claim 11, characterized in that
the arms (23) of an essentially U-shaped plate (24) are

freely pivoted to said lever arm (17) at the same axis on
which said pair of shoulders (19a,19b) of said wing (20) is

pivoted.
Device according to claim 12, characterized in that
the length of said arms (23) is such as to accommodate,

between them, the part of said larger portion (21) of said
wing (20) that lies below said lever arm (17) when said

plate lies adjacent and below said lever arm.
