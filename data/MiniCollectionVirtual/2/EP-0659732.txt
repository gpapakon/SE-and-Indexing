<ABSTRACT>
This invention pertains to compounds represented by formula 

wherein R is selected from the group consisting of branched and 
unbranched lower-alkyl and lower-cycloalkyl groups having up to to 10 

carbon atoms. The present invention also provides flavoring, in particular 
smoking compositions, and methods for flavoring, e.g. smoking 

compositions, which incorporate the novel alkyl sclareol diol carbonates of 
the invention.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to novel carbonate derivatives of decahydro-2-hydroxy-2,5,5,8a-tetramethyl-1-naphthaleneethanol 
(alkyl sclareol diol 
carbonates) which effectively release a desirable woody amber odor to the 
mainstream and sidestream smoke of cigarettes. In addition, the novel 
carbonates are odorless, or nearly odorless, crystalline solids which are 
stable to storage in cigarettes under ambient conditions. The present 
invention also provides smoking compositions, and methods for flavoring 
smoking compositions, which incorporate the novel alkyl sclareol diol 
carbonates of the invention. Flavor additives have long been used to flavor a wide variety of 
consumer products, particularly tobacco products, foodstuffs, and gums. 
Flavor additives in such products may be used to mask or attenuate 
undesirable flavors or odorants, and to enhance existing flavors or odors, or 
to provide additional flavors or odors not initially present in the consumer 
product. In tobacco and tobacco products, flavorants have been added in order 
to modify or enhance the overall flavor of the product upon use, primarily 
during smoking. However, the use of many flavorants in tobacco is limited 
by the volatility or stability of the particular flavorant. Consequently, there is 
a need for flavorants to be incorporated into tobacco products in such a 
manner that the flavorant is stable and nonvolatile but then will be released 
during use. Sylvamber (a Givaudan-Roure trade name for do decahydro-3a,6,6,9a-tetramethylnaphtho[2,1-B]furan, 
CAS# 6790-58-5) has long been 
used in fragrances to provide a strong woody amber note. Sylvamber has 
been reported to be a component of French Tobacco Absolute, B. Corbier, C. 
Ehret, E. Giraudi and G. Pelerin (Flavors and Fragrances: A World 
Perspective, Proceedings of the 10th International Congress of Essential 
Oils, Fragrances and Flavors, B.M. Lawrence, B.D. Mookerjee and B.J. 
Willis (editors), p. 483-494, Elsevier Science Publishers, Amsterdam, 1988).  
 
Sylvamber has also found occasional use as a tobacco flavorant. The utility of 
Sylvamber, however, is limited by its low odor threshold and its volatility. 
When used at levels high enough to have a strong impact upon smoking, 
Sylvamber tends to volatilize from the cigarette into the surrounding pack. 
In addition, Sylvamber imparts an odor to the unsmoked cigarette which is 
not acceptable to many smokers. A principal strategy currently employed to impart flavors and odors to 
consumer products is admixing the flavorant
