<ABSTRACT>
Solutions such as for example drinking water, ground 
water and extracting solutions contaminated with heavy 

metals and radioactive species, singly or in combination, 
are treated by first treating the contaminated solution 

with silicate and ammonium hydroxide solution precipitants; 
then the contaminated solution is separately treated with 

an acid which gels, polymerizes and/or precipitates the 
contaminant-containing silica matrix to form an easily 

dewaterable and separable solid, whereby the solid contaminants 
are readily removed from the cleansed solution by 

filtration means.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates generally to precipitation 
methods for decontaminating various types of solutions 
which are contaminated with a variety of contaminants such 
as heavy metals and radioactive compounds, using a novel 
combination of treatment steps. More particularly, this 
invention relates to methods for remediating water contaminated 
with uranium, thorium, mercury and/or copper using 
silicate, ammonium hydroxide and acid, to precipitate the 
contaminants and ultimately separate them from solution. There is increasing concern over the hazards posed 
by the rising levels of inorganic contaminants within the 
world's water supplies due to accidental spills, leaks, 
mining practices and poor disposal practices. Most heavy 
metal contaminants are toxic to some degree to all life-forms. 
In humans, toxic heavy metal poisoning can lead to 
severe nervous system disorders and can cause death. It has been suggested that various inorganic 
contaminants in solution can be removed via precipitation 
techniques. In particular, the use of sodium silicate 
(also referred to as water glass or Na₂SiO₃) to remove 
uranium and/or thorium from waste streams has been suggested. 
For example, in U.S. Patent No. 4,501,691 (Tanaka et 
al.), there is described a process for treating radioactive 
liquid waste in which the liquid waste is treated with 
sodium silicate to form a uranium containing silica precipitate. 
The precipitate subsequently is treated in a step-wise 
fashion with acid to recover the uranium, and then  
 
alkali metal hydroxide solution to regenerate the water 
glass. Silicate precipitation processes for uranium and 
thorium recovery also are described in U.S. Patent Nos. 
4,349,513 (Ishiwata et al.); 5,077,020 (Lahoda et al); and 
U.S. Patent No. 4,338,286 (Nakai et al.). In Ishiwata et 
al., the liquid waste is treated with sodium silicate in 
the presence of aqueous fluorine and ammonia to make a 
uranium/thorium-containing silicate precipitate which is 
filtered out of the process stream and sent to a holding 
tank. In Lahoda et al., the contaminated stream is treated 
with sodium silicate in the presence of ammonia, fluoride, 
and nitrate in water. Nakai et al. generally describe a 
precipitation process for treating liquids contaminated 
with uranium/thorium wherein sodium silicate is added to 
the solution in the presence of ammonia water and chlorine 
to cause a contaminant-containing silica precipitate to 
form. There are significant disadvantages associated 
with the application of each
