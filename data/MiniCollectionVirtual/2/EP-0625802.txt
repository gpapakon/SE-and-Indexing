<ABSTRACT>
A solar cell module and an installation method thereof 
are disclosed. The solar cell module comprises an active 

solar cell element and a filler holding element disposed on 
said active solar cell element, said active solar cell 

element and said filler holding element being encapsulated 
with a filler between a transparent film and a reinforcing 

member, the solar cell module being characterized in that 
the reinforcing member, the filler, and the transparent 

film are bent in the direction opposite to the surface to 
be illuminated with the sunlight, wherein there is no 

filler holding element at least in a bending portion. The 
solar cell module arranged in the above-described manner 

can be installed without degradation in conversion 
efficiency of the solar cell module. Furthermore, the total 

weight and total size including installation materials are 
very small.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a solar cell module
with no installation frame, and to an installation method
thereof. More specifically, the present invention relates
to a solar cell module which has a solar cell reinforcing
member, wherein the reinforcing member is also used to
install the solar cell module, and which can maintain
excellent characteristics without a significant reduction
in conversion efficiency. The present invention also
relates to a method of installing a solar cell module of
this type.In recent years, it has been predicted that an increase
in CO2 in the atmosphere will give rise to a greenhouse
effect, which will result in a serious global temperature
increase. From this view point, the requirement for
development of a clean energy source which does not exhaust
CO2 has become serious. The nuclear power generation does not exhaust CO2.
However, it has an unsolved problem regarding the treatment
of radioactive wastes, and it is required to develop a
safer and cleaner energy source than that.Among various candidates for clean energy sources for
future use, one of the most promising energy sources is a
solar cell, which has advantageous properties in that it is
clean, safe, and easy to treat.There are various types of solar cells discussed below. One example is
a solar cell module comprising an active solar cell element
made up of single crystal silicon. The active solar cell
element used in this type of module is sensitive to a
mechanical shock. Therefore, it is needed to protect its
surface with a thick glass plate and EVA (ethylene-vinyl
acetate copolymer) wherein EVA is filled between the active
solar cell element and the glass plate.Another example is a solar cell module comprising an
active solar cell element made of non-single crystal
silicon formed on a glass plate. This type of module also
includes a thick glass plate as in the case of solar cell
modules made of single crystal silicon.In solar cell modules of these types having a glass
plate on their surface, it is required to attach a frame to
them so as to protect the periphery of the glass plate, to
reinforce the mechanical strength of the glass plate, and 
to connect a module to another module or to install the
module on an installation base element.Materials for a frame include metal, plastic, wood,
etc. The weight of a solar cell module having a glass plate
is as great as 10 kg/m2. Therefore, a frame material should
have a sufficiently great mechanical strength to support
such a great weight. From this view point,
