<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a vinyl 
acetylsalicylate-vinyl alcohol based copolymer suitable for 
use as medicament and to a copolymeric precursor thereof. Acetylsalicylic acid is widely used as a medicament, 
called aspirin, for producing antipyretic and analgesic 
medicines. There have been many investigations on 
acetylsalicylic acid, and it has recently been reported 
that acetylsalicylic acid has some newly found effects such 
as antithrombotic effect in addition to the antipyretic and 
analgesic effects. For broadening the scope of application of 
acetylsalicylic acid as medicament, attempts have been made 
to control as desired or stabilize the efficacy of the 
acid. For instance, conversion of acetylsalicylic acid to 
its sodium salt, aluminum salt, etc., incorporation of 
acetylsalicylic acid in tablets, capsules, etc. and the 
like methods have been attempted for the purpose of 
controlling and stabilizing the efficacy of acetylsalicylic 
acid. These methods, however, are not yet satisfactory for 
enlarging the application area of acetylsalicylic acid as 
medicament. As another means for broadening the scope of  
 
application of acetylsalicylic acid as medicament, a vinyl 
acetylsalicylate polymer obtained by polymerizing vinyl 
acetylsalicylate has been proposed. The polymer upon 
hydrolysis yields acetylsalicylic acid. The hydrolysis is 
regulated to control the amount of acetylsalicylic acid 
formed, thereby controlling the efficacy of the acid, or 
the way the effects of the acid are exerted. A further attempt has been made in which the vinyl 
acetylsalicylate is regulated in degree of polymerization 
or saponification, whereby the amount of acetylsalicylic 
acid groups in the polymer can be varied, in order to 
control the efficacy of acetylsalicylic acid. However, the vinyl acetylsalicylate polymer is a 
homopolymer and its saponification reaction proceeds with 
difficulty. Therefore, it is difficult to achieve the 
intended control of saponification degree of the polymer, 
namely, to accomplish a desired control of the efficacy of 
acetylsalicylic acid. It is accordingly an object of the present invention 
to provide a new vinyl acetylsalicylate-vinyl alcohol based 
copolymer which ensures easy control of the efficacy of 
acetylsalicylic acid, and to a copolymeric precursor of 
said copolymer. The present invention provides, as a means for 
attaining the above object, a vinyl acetylsalicylate-vinyl 
alcohol based copolymer 
as set forth in claim 1. The invention also provides a
