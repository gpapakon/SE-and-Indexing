<ABSTRACT>
The automatic flow controller comprises a rigid shutter (2) which is articulated (at 2b) in the body (1) and which is subject on the one hand to elastic means (3) and on the other hand to the pressure of the current of air (F), this antagonistic action ensuring the control of said shutter which leaves free at any moment a cross-section which is suitable for ensuring the balancing of the installation.

<CLAIMS>
Automatic flow regulator for ventilation, air-conditioning 
or similar units, of the kind equipped with 

a moveable member against which act, in opposition, the 
differential air pressure existing on either side of the 

said moveable member and elastic means for the purpose of 
modifying the air flow area, the said regulator comprising 


elastic means (3) associated with the damper, for 
the purpose of bringing the latter back to the position 

of maximum opening; 
and a dashpot (4), the moveable member (4
a
) of 
which is fastened to the damper, for the purpose of 

eliminating buffeting effects; 
 
characterized in that it comprises, in combination: 


a tubular body (1) suitable for defining a duct 
having two parallel plane walls (1
b
) which are joined by 
a plane wall (1
c
) and an arched wall (1
d
), the said body 
being designed (at 1
a
) to be attached to a pipe (C); 
a rigid damper (2) which, having a profile similar 
to that of the cross-section of the aforementioned duct, 

is articulated (at 2
b
) to the body (1) transversely to 
the axis of the duct of the latter, which damper is 

associated with two stops (2
c
, 2
d
) which define a position 
of maximum closure and a position of maximum opening, 

the latter providing a pressure chamber (6) which is 
closed substantially at the articulation (2
b
) of the 
damper and which opens to the upstream in the direction 

of blow of the air. 
Regulator according to Claim 1, characterized in  
 

that the elastic means associated with the damper (2) 
consist of at least one strip (3), one end of which bears 

against the body (1) while the opposite end is held fast 
to the said damper. 
Regulator according to either of Claims 1 and 2, 
characterized in that the stop defining the position of 

maximum closure consists of the transverse edge, curved 
in the form of a beak (2
c
), of the damper (2) which is 
located to the rear of the hinge pin (2
b
). 
Regulator according to any one of Claims 1 to 3, 
characterized in that the stop defining the position of 

maximum opening consists of two lateral rime (2
d
) provided 
on that face of the damper (2) which is turned 

towards the plane wall (1
c
) of the duct. 
Regulator according to any one of Claims 1 to 4, 
characterised in that the dashpot (4) comprises a moveable 

member in the form of a piston (4
a
) inserted so as 
to be able to slide in a virtually sealed manner in a 

cylinder (4
b
), the elements (4
a
, 4
b
) of this dashpot 
being fastened to the damper (2) and to the body (1).
