<ABSTRACT>
A process for forming a color image which may be 
used to represent a printed color image to be obtained 

from a printing press comprising (a) forming a thermal 
dye transfer image in a polymeric dye image-receiving 

layer of an intermediate dye-receiving element by 
imagewise-heating a dye-donor element and transferring 

a dye image to the dye image-receiving layer, (b) 
applying a dye-migration barrier layer to one surface 

of a paper substrate, and (c) transferring the imaged 
polymeric dye image-receiving layer to the surface of 

the paper having the dye-migration barrier layer 
applied thereon; the dye-migration barrier layer 

comprising 

(a) crosslinked polymeric particles whose average 
diameter is equal to or less than about one-half the 

thickness of the layer; or 
(b) a polymer containing a polymeric crystallizable 
plasticizer that is at least partially compatible with 

the polymer and which has a crystalline melting point of 
less than about 135°C.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a thermal dye 
transfer process for obtaining a color image which may 
be used to represent a printed image to be obtained 
from a printing press, and more particularly to the use 
of a particular dye migration barrier layer in the 
resulting color image to control dye smear and to 
provide its use in an automatic laminating and 
delaminating device without rough edge tear and 
mechanical jams. In order to approximate the appearance of 
continuous-tone (photographic) images via ink-on-paper 
printing, the commercial printing industry relies on a 
process known as halftone printing. In halftone 
printing, color density gradations are produced by 
printing patterns of dots of various sizes, but of the 
same color density, instead of varying the color 
density uniformly as is done in photographic printing. There is an important commercial need to 
obtain a color proof image before a printing press run 
is made. It is desired that the color proof will 
accurately represent the image quality, details, color 
tone scale and, in many cases, the halftone pattern of 
the prints obtained on the printing press. In the 
sequence of operations necessary to produce an ink-printed, 
full-color picture, a proof is also required 
to check the accuracy of the color separation data from 
which the final three or more printing plates or 
cylinders are made. Traditionally, such color 
separation proofs have involved silver halide 
photographic, high-contrast lithographic systems or 
non-silver halide light-sensitive systems which require 
many exposure and processing steps before a final, 
full-color picture is assembled.  
 In U.S. Patent 5,126,760, a thermal dye 
transfer process is described for producing a direct 
digital, halftone color proof of an original image. 
The proof is used to represent a printed color image 
obtained from a printing press. The process described 
therein comprises: 
a) generating a set of electrical signals which is 
representative of the shape and color scale of an 
original image; b) contacting a dye-donor element comprising a 
support having thereon a dye layer and an infrared-absorbing 
material with a first intermediate dye-receiving 
element comprising a support having thereon a 
polymeric, dye image-receiving layer; c) using the signals to imagewise-heat by means of 
a diode laser the dye-donor element, thereby 
transferring a dye image to the first dye-receiving 
element; and d) retransferring the dye image to a second final 
dye image-receiving element which
