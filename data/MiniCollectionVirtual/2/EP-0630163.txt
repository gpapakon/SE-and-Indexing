<ABSTRACT>
A radio system which is arranged to operate in accordance 
with a packet reservation multiple access protocol, wherein at 

least one time slot in each frame is designated for the 
transmission of access contention data, which time slot includes a 

field reserved for data specifying preferred information slots 
required by a sub-unit, and which system includes a base station 

adapted for operation such that consequent upon receipt of data 
in the said reserved field, the base station is arranged to respond 

by allocating the preferred slots, if available, thereby to satisfy 
the requirement of the sub-unit, the sub unit being arranged to 

include monitor means for monitoring in respect of predetermined 
slots, a parameter in dependence upon which expected 

communication quality is predictable, and slot selection means 
effective for selecting the said preferred slots in dependence upon 

this monitoring operation.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to cellular mobile radio systems and
more especially, although not exclusively, it relates to an
improvement in or modification of a cellular mobile radio system
arranged to operate in accordance with the packet reservation
multiple access protocol which forms the subject of our co-pending
GB Patent Application No 9219824.1.Although the invention is primarily intended for
incorporation in digital cellular mobile radio communication
systems, it may also find application in wireless local area
networks.According to our co-pending patent application, a cellular
mobile radio system is provided which is arranged to operate in
accordance with a packet reservation multiple access protocol,
where at least one time slot in each frame is designated for the
transmission of access contention data which includes a field
reserved for data specifying a number of information slots
required by a mobile unit, and which system includes a base
station adapted for operation such that consequent upon receipt of
data in the said reserved field, the base station is arranged to
respond by allocating available slots to satisfy the requirement of
the mobile unit.One important advantage of this system as will be
appreciated by those skilled in the art, is that since only one
access contention request is required, irrespective of the number 
of information slots required, the access contention time required
to reserve capacity will be minimised or at least substantially
reduced as compared with a system in which each individual slot
must be contended for. Although the system is an improvement
over hitherto known arrangements, in that the access contention
time is reduced, the choice of the slots used is made solely by the
base station on the basis of availability, with a result that some
slots may be less than ideal due, for example, to the level of co-channel
interference experienced by the mobile.It is therefore an object of the present invention to provide
an improved system wherein slots are chosen in such a manner as
to avoid the selection of those slots wherein communication
quality is likely to be less than ideal.According to the present invention we provide a radio
system which is arranged to operate in accordance with a packet
reservation multiple access protocol, wherein at least one time slot
in each frame is designated for the transmission of access
contention data, which time slot includes a field reserved for data
specifying preferred information slots required by a sub-unit, and
which system
</DESCRIPTION>
<CLAIMS>
A radio system which is arranged to operate in accordance
with a packet reservation multiple access protocol, wherein

at least one time slot in each frame is designated for the
transmission of access contention data, which time slot includes a

field reserved for data specifying preferred information slots
required by a sub-unit (1-17,30), and which system includes a

base station (18-29) adapted for operation such that consequent
upon receipt of data in the said reserved field, the base station is

arranged to respond by allocating the preferred slots, if available,
thereby to satisfy the requirement of the sub-unit (1-17, 30), the

system being characterised in that the sub unit is
arranged to include monitor means (30) for

monitoring in respect of predetermined slots, a parameter in
dependence upon which expected communication quality is

predictable, and slot selection means (30) effective for selecting
the said preferred slots in dependence upon this monitoring

operation.
A radio system as claimed in Claim 1 which is a cellular
mobile radio system wherein the sub-unit (1-17, 30) is a mobile

unit.
A system as claimed in Claim 1 and Claim 2, wherein the
predetermined slots are those slots used for the transmission of

information. 
A system as claimed in any preceding claim, wherein the
parameter measured is the signal to noise level as indicated by

the carrier level to interference level ratio.
A system as claimed in any preceding claim, wherein the
mobile unit (1-17, 30) includes a memory storage device used to

store data appertaining to the information slots used in a previous
transmission and a slot transmission timer (17) responsive to the

store for re-setting the transmitter so that the same tune slots are
re-selected for use in the next successive frame consequent upon

confirmation from the base station (18-29) that the slots used in
the previous period of transmission activity should be re-used in

the next successive frame.
A system as claimed in Claim 5, wherein preparation for the
same slots to be re-used is performed also in the base station (18-29)

wherein the receiver chain (14) is prepared in advance and so
expects to receive transmission bursts in slots used previously.
