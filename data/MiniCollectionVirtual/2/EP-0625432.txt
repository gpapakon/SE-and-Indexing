Signature folder or sorter constituted by the joining-together
of a plurality of sheets (1, 11) each having a

front page (2, 12) and a back page (12'), of the type in
which each sheet (1, 11) comprises at least one retaining

tab, a strip (3, 13) of the said sheet (1, 11), which strip
is folded over along a groove (15) formed in a manner

parallel with one edge (30) of the said sheet (1, 11) and
is glued, by a narrow portion (4, 14) situated along the

said groove (15), onto a corresponding narrow portion of
the page situated opposite the said portion (4, 14'),

forming, between its non-glued portion and the said page
(2, 12), the said retaining tab,

characterised in that

the said strip (3, 13) of the said sheet (1, 11) is folded
over along the groove (15) in a direction such that the

said narrow portion (4, 14) is glued onto the same page (2,
12) of the said sheet (1, 11) from which the said strip (3,

13) originates.
Signature folder or sorter according to claim 1,
characterised in that the said strip (3, 13) of the said

sheet (1, 11) is folded over upwards along the groove (15)
in such a way that it is glued, by its front face, onto the

front page (2, 12) of the same sheet (1, 11) along a narrow
portion (4, 14) situated along the groove (15), the said

retaining tab being constituted between, on the one hand,
that non-glued front portion of the strip (3, 13) which is

situated between the extreme edge (30) of the sheet (1, 11)
and the narrow portion (4, 14) and, on the other hand, that

front page (2, 12) of the same sheet (1, 11) which faces
it.
Signature folder or sorter according to claim 1,
characterised in that a strip (23) of the said sheet (11)

is folded over downwards along a groove (25), in such a way
that it is stuck by its back face onto the back page (12')

of the same sheet (11), along a narrow portion (24) 
situated along the groove (25), the said retaining tab

being constituted between, on the one hand, that non-glued
back portion of the strip (23) which is situated between

the extreme edge (40) of the sheet (11) and the narrow
portion (24) and, on the other hand, that back page (12')

which faces it under the same sheet (11).
Signature folder or sorter according to claim 1,
characterised in that each sheet (1, 11) comprises, at the

same time, at least two retaining tabs distributed over at
least two of its edges, the one created with the front page

(2, 12) in accordance with claim 2 and the other created
under the back page (12') in accordance with claim 3.
Signature folder according to claim 4, characterised in
that each sheet (11, 11') comprises four retaining tabs

(13, 23, 110, 111 ; 13', 23', 110', 111') distributed over
the two pairs of parallel edges of the sheet.
Signature folder according to claim 4, characterised in
that, the sheet (11, 11') comprising two pairs of parallel

strips (13, 23, 110, 111 ; 13', 23', 110', 111'), each
strip of each pair being folded over and glued partially,

the one (13, 111; 13', 111') onto the front page, and the
other (23, 110; 23', 110') onto the back page of the sheet,

the tabs (110, 111; 110', 111') of a pair which are thus
formed are cut away (113, 112; 113', 112') at the place

where they would be superposed on the tabs (23, 13; 23'
13') of the other pair.
