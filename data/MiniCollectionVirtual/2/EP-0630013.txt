<ABSTRACT>
A tape loading device of a magnetic recording/reproducing 
apparatus, is characterized by including: 

first and second tape guide posts (9,11) for taking a tape 
(14), extending between a supply side reel (3) and a winding 

side reel (4) of a tape cassette (2), from the tape cassette 
and travelling the tape to a predetermined position located 

outside the tape cassette; first and second loading guides 
(19,20) for respectively guiding travels of the first and 

second tape guide posts to take out the tape from the tape 
cassette to the predetermined position; a common guide (22) 

for joining a part of the first loading guide and a part of 
second loading guide into the same path so as to guide the 

first and second loading guides in order; and a branch 
pointer arm (24,25) for switching between the common guide 

and the first and second loading guides, the branch pointer 
arm being urged to open one loading guide of the loading 

guides and close the other loading guide thereof, and 
pressed by one tape guide post of the tape guide posts when 

the tape guide post, moving along the common guide in 
precedence to the other tape guide post, has guided by the 

one loading guide which has been opened, whereby the one 
loading guide is closed and the other loading guide is 

opened to guide the other tape guide post of the tape guide 
posts.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a tape loading
device of a magnetic recording/reproducing apparatus such as
a cassette type video tape recorder.As a conventional tape loading device of a cassette
type video tape recorder for recording or reproducing
a video signal by taking out a magnetic tape from a tape
cassette and winding it around the peripheral surface of a
rotation drum disposed in the vicinity of the tape cassette,
the following type tape loading device is known: A magnetic
tape is taken out of the cassette tape using each moving
type loading roller post disposed on the supply reel side
and winding reel side and then, the magnetic tape is wound
around the rotation drum from both sides thereof.For example, as shown in Fig. 17, a loading roller
post 201 disposed on the winding reel side is moved in the
direction shown by the arrow 202 so as to take a magnetic
tape 203 out of a tape cassette and at the same time, a
loading roller post 204 disposed on the supply reel side is
moved in the direction shown by the arrow 205 so as to take 
the magnetic tape 203 out of the tape cassette. Thereafter,
the magnetic tape 203 is wound around a rotation drum 206
from both sides thereof.However, in order to make the rotation drum
compact so that a magnetic recording/reproducing apparatus
such as a camera-integrated video tape recorder is made to
be compact, it is necessary to wind the magnetic tape deep
around the rotation drum. To this end, as shown in Fig. 18,
the loading roller post 201 disposed on the winding reel
side is moved to the back of the rotation drum 206 in the
direction shown by the arrow 207. At this time, in order to
secure the tape path of the magnetic tape 203, a post 208 is
moved in the direction shown by the arrow 209 so as to
expand the tape path. The posts 201, 204, and 208 are moved
by an appropriate driving means and a loading guide for
providing the travel path of the posts 201, 204, and 208,
respectively. In Figs. 17 and 18, reference numeral 210
denotes a fixed type pinch roller. The magnetic tape 203 is
sandwiched between the pinch roller 210 and a capstan 212
which moves from the tape cassette side. Thus, the force
for travelling the magnetic tape 203 is imparted thereto.
Reference numeral 213 denotes a device for driving the
capstan 212.In the above known construction, two moving paths
are required to move the posts 201 and 208 in the directions 
shown by the arrows 207 and 209 using each loading guide.
Therefore, the spaces for the moving paths are required,
which makes it very

<CLAIMS>
A tape loading device of a magnetic recording/reproducing apparatus, in
which a magnetic tape (14) is taken out from a tape cassette (2) and

wound around a rotary cylinder (23) on which a rotary magnetic head is
mounted by a tape guide post (9 or 11) for recording/reproducing

operation, the tape guide post (9 or 11) is placed at its unloading
position, which is a loading start position, in a travel path before

starting an operation for winding the tape (14) around the cylinder
(23) by the tape guide post (9 or 11), and the tape guide post (9 or

11) is placed at its loading position, which is a loading completion
position, in the travel path when the tape guide post (9 or 11) allows

the tape (14) to be wound around the cylinder (23) for the
recording/reproducing operation;

characterized by

a tape guide post supporting member (15 or 16) carrying the tape guide
post (9 or 11) for moving the tape guide post (9 or 11) between the

unloading and loading positions along the travel path (19a, 22, 19b; or
20a, 22, 20b), the tape guide post supporting member (15 or 16) being

placed at the unloading and loading positions of the tape guide post (9
or 11) in the travel path (19a, 19b; or 20a, 20b);
a loading guide (19 or 20) having a guide groove for guiding the tape
guide post supporting member (15 or 16) along the travel path (19a, 22,

19b; or 20a, 22, 20b);
a pinch roller arm (75) pivotal about an axis (77) thereof, the pinch
roller arm having an auxiliary loading guide constituting a part of the

loading guide (19 or 20); and
a pinch roller (10) mounted on the pinch roller arm (75) and moving,
according to pivotal motion of the pinch roller arm (75), along a path,

which intersects the travel path of the tape guide post (9 or 11), from
an interior of the tape cassette (2) to a position near a capstan (30)

provided outside the tape cassette (2) so as to sandwich the tape (14),
taken out from the tape cassette (2) by the tape guide post (9 or 11),

between itself and the capstan (30).
