<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a process for depositing, using plasma polymerisation, a layer or a protective film on the surface of a plastic substrate. It comprises at least the steps of:   1. pretreatment consisting in arranging the plastic substrate on a substrate holder which is only slightly biased or not biased, in subjecting it to at least one pretreatment gas allowing influx of oxygen and in supplying, within the gaseous pretreatment medium, a minimal quantity of energy to create a quantity of oxygen in the plasma for the purpose of activating the surface of the substrate, this energy being supplied in the form of an electric power density pulse, and 2. deposition of the layer or the film on the surface of the substrate by means of a plasma consisting of a gaseous deposition mixture comprising at least one gas allowing influx of oxygen and an organic silicon-containing compound.

Process for deposition, by plasma
polymerization, of a protective layer or film on the

surface of a plastic substrate, in which the substrate
is exposed to a plasma obtained in a low-vacuum reactor

by electrical discharge in a gaseous medium,

characterized in that
 it comprises at least the
following steps:


a) pretreatment of the said plastic substrate,
consisting in placing it on a substrate holder which
