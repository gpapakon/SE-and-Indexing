<ABSTRACT>
A method for the treatment of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is disclosed. The method comprises administration of an antibody, polypeptide or other molecule recognizing VLA-4, a surface molecule expressed on most types of white blood cells and involved in leukocyte adhesion to endothelium and other tissus in the gut.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a treatment for 
inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). More particularly, this 
invention relates to the use of antibodies recognizing the 
integrin VLA-4 (very late antigen-4) in the treatment of 
IBD. Inflammatory bowel disease, or IBD, is a 
collective term encompassing ulcerative colitis and 
Crohn's disease (ileitis), which are chronic inflammatory 
disorders of the gastrointestinal tract. Ulcerative 
colitis is confined to the large intestine (colon) and 
rectum, and involves only the inner lining of the 
intestinal wall. Crohn's disease may affect any section 
of the gastrointestinal tract (i.e., mouth, esophagus, 
stomach, small intestine, large intestine, rectum and 
anus) and may involve all layers of the intestinal wall. 
Both diseases are characterized by abdominal pain and 
cramping, diarrhea, rectal bleeding and fever. The 
symptoms of these diseases are usually progressive, and 
sufferers typically experience periods of remission 
followed by severe flareups. IBD affects an estimated two million people in 
the United States alone. Although IBD is not considered a 
fatal illness, prolonged disease can lead to severe 
malnutrition affecting growth or to the formation of 
abscesses or intestinal scar tissue, leading in turn to 
infection or bowel obstruction. IBD has no cure, and the exact causes of IBD are 
not yet understood. Conventional treatments for IBD have 
involved anti-inflammatory drugs, immunosuppressive drugs  
 
and surgery. Sulfasalazine and related drugs having the 
bioactive 5-amino-salicylic acid (5-ASA) moiety are widely 
used to control moderate IBD symptoms and to maintain 
remission. Severe inflammation is often treated with 
powerful corticosteroids and sometimes ACTH or with 
immunosuppressants such as 6-mercaptopurine and 
azathioprine. The most common surgical treatments for 
severe chronic IBD are intestinal resections and, 
ultimately, colectomy, which is a complete cure only for 
ulcerative colitis. Severe side effects are associated with the 
drugs commonly prescribed for IBD, including nausea, 
dizziness, changes in blood chemistry (including anemia 
and leukopenia), skin rashes and drug dependence; and the 
surgical treatments are radical procedures that often 
profoundly alter the everyday life of the patient. 
Accordingly, there is a great need for treatments for IBD 
that are effective yet less severe in their side effects 
and are less invasive of the IBD sufferer's body and 
quality of life. The search for the causes of IBD

<CLAIMS>
CLAIMS:
1. A method for the treatment of inflammatory bowel disease comprising administering to a mammal suffering from inflammatory bowel disease a composition comprising an anti-VLA-4 antibody.
2. The method of Claim 1, wherein the anti- VLA-4 antibody composition is administered intravenously.
3. The method of Claim 1, wherein the anti- VLA-4 antibody is selected from the group consisting of HP1/2, HP2/1, HP2/4, L25, and P4C2.
4. The method of Claim 1, wherein the anti- VLA-4 antibody is HP1/2, or a fragment thereof capable of binding to VLA-4.
5. The method of Claim 1, wherein the composition is administered at a dosage so as to provide from 0.05 to 5.0 mg/kg of antibody, based on the weight of the inflammatory bowel disease sufferer.
6. The method of Claim 5, wherein the composition is administered at a dosage so as to provide 0.5 to 2.0 mg/kg of antibody, based on the weight of the inflammatory bowel disease sufferer.
7. The method according to Claim 1, wherein the composition is administered in an amount effective to provide a plasma level of antibody in the mammal of 10-15 μg/ml.
8. The method according to Claim 1, wherein the mammal is a human.
9. The method of Claim 8, wherein the mammal suffers from ulcerative colitis. 10. The method of Claim 8, wherein the mammal suffers from Crohn's Disease. 


 11. The method of Claim 1, wherein the composition is administered during an acute flareup of the inflammatory bowel disease.
12. A method for the treatment of inflammatory bowel disease comprising administering to a mammal suffering from inflammatory bowel disease an antibody, a recombinant antibody, a chimeric antibody, fragments of such antibodies, a polypeptide or a small molecule capable of binding to the α
4
 subunit of VLA-4, or combinations of any of the foregoing, in an amount effective to provide relief to said mammal.
13. The method of Claim 12, wherein the antibody, polypeptide or molecule is selected from monoclonal antibody HP1/2; Fab, Fab', F(ab')
2
 or F(v) fragments of such antibody; soluble VCAM-1 polypeptides; or small molecules that bind to the VCAM-1-binding domain of VLA-4.
14. The method of Claim 12 , wherein the composition comprises a plurality of anti-VLA-4 monoclonal antibodies or VLA-4-binding fragments thereof.
15. The method of Claim 12, wherein the composition includes, in addition to anti-VLA-4, an anti- ELAM-1 antibody, an anti-lCAM-1 antibody, an anti-VCAM-1 antibody, an anti-CDX antibody, an anti-LFA-1 antibody, an anti-CD18 antibody or combinations of any such antibodies.
16. The method of Claim 12, wherein the anti- VLA-4 antibody is HP1/2, or a fragment thereof capable of binding to VLA-4. 


 17. The method of Claim 12, wherein the composition is administered at a dosage so as to provide from 0.05 to 5.0 mg/kg of antibody, antibody fragment, polypeptide or small molecule, based on the weight of the inflammatory bowel disease sufferer.
18. The method of Claim 17, wherein the composition is administered at a dosage so as to provide 0.5 to 2.0 mg/kg of antibody, antibody fragment, polypeptide or small molecule, based on the weight of the inflammatory bowel disease sufferer.
19. The method according to Claim 12, wherein the composition is administered in an amount effective to provide a plasma level of antibody in the mammal of 10-15 μg/ml. 20. A pharmaceutical composition effective to significantly reduce acute inflammation in IBD tissues in an IBD sufferer, consisting essentially of a monoclonal antibody recognizing VLA-4 in a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier.
