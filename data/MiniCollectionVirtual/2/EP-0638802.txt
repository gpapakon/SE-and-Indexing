<ABSTRACT>
A direct-read exposimeter for providing a visual, graded 
measurement of color variation corresponding to different ranges of 

dosage exposure to a polluting gas in the atmosphere over a given time 
period. The exposimeter includes a color-forming member and at least 

one gas-diffusion control member within an enclosure formed between 
a base and a cover. The cover has a number of openings exposed to 

the atmosphere in alignment with a number of separate diffusion zones 
formed in the gas-diffusion control member.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a direct-read, passive, colorimetric 
exposimeter which may readily be carried by an individual for 
performing a real-time measurement of the exposure level of a 
gas/vapor pollutant in the ambient atmosphere. There is a need in the field of industrial hygiene for a 
colorimetric, passive device, which may be carried by an individual in 
the form of a badge, to provide a direct-read quantitative measurement 
of the range of concentration of various toxic gases and/or vapors in 
the ambient atmosphere, by means of real-time integration of the 
exposure level of such toxic gases or vapors over a fixed time horizon. Several methods are presently known for the colorimetric 
estimation of time-weighted average (TWA) measurements and the 
short-term exposure limit (STEL) of toxic gases and vapors in the 
atmosphere. These methods can be classified into the following major 
categories: 
1. Methods which compare the quality of a received 
colorimetric result (density, color, tone, shade, or nuance) to a given 
color standard. The colorimetric devices of this category rely on a gas 
pollutant reacting chemically with reagent(s) dispersed on a suitable 
substrate to produce a color change. The estimation of the gas  
 
pollutant is semiquantitative and is reliable only for a relatively narrow 
exposure interval. 2. Methods which use the quantity of the received 
color expressed by area or length of stain. In general, the devices in 
this category are made of transparent tubes filled with a granular, solid 
support impregnated with colorimetric reagent(s). Gas pollutants 
penetrate by diffusion through a diffusion retainer and react with the 
colorimetric reagent(s). The colorimetric result is a length of stain 
proportioned to the total exposure value of the concentration multiplied 
by the exposure time, i.e., CT value. The measure of exposure is visual 
and occurs by comparing the length of the stain to a fixed scale. 
Although this is a significant advantage, such devices are nonlinear and 
their response time changes with the length of stain. Several passive, direct-read, colorimetric devices have 
been proposed in the patent literature, which rely upon the degree of 
gas penetration through the chromophoric reagent to determine dosage 
exposure, and to visually provide a graded sensitivity in the color 
detection for real-time measurement. In the dosimeter of U.S. Patent 
No. 4,478,792, issued to McConnaughy, a stack of porous sheets are 
impregnated with a reagent, causing the

polluting gas in the ambient atmosphere and for providing a visual, 

graded measurement of color variation corresponding to different 
ranges of exposure to such polluting gas over a given time period, 

comprising: a base composed of a gas-impermeable, inert material; a 
cover for said base composed of a gas-impermeable, inert material,
