<ABSTRACT>
A gas-flow heat exchanger comprises a sinuously wound foil strip (11) providing a stack of parallel pockets (12) each of which contains a moulded plastics skeletal insert (13). The insert (13) comprises a flat rectangular frame (14) supporting within it a set of parallel baffles (15) which define a platen of passageways (16) extending between inlet and outlet openings (17 and 18) provided in the frame (14). Webs (20) lie in the medial plane of the frame and support the baffles (15). Holes and rebates (24, 25) are provided in the lower part of the insert to drain water from its interior. The foil (11) may be coated with hydrophilic material on one side.

<DESCRIPTION>
 MOULDED BAFFLE HEAT EXCHANGERFIELD OF THE INVENTIONThis invention relates to a tubeless heat exchanger for transferring heat between two gas- flow paths.STATE OF THE ARTHeat exchangers for transferring heat between two isolated gas-flow paths have developed along different lines from liquid heat exchangers. This has resulted from the fact that gas, unlike a liquid, is incompressible and has a lower heat content per unit volume than a liquid. This has lead to the development of heat exchangers in which the gas-flow paths have a large cross-sectional area so that there is an insignificant pressure drop between -the gas inlet and outlet apertures of the heat exchanger. Also, thin materials are preferred because the transfer of heat from a gas to a surface along which it is travelling, takes place more slowly than is the case with a liquid which wets the surface.The conventional form of heat exchanger for use with gases is the parallel plate heat exchanger. This comprises a stack of spaced, parallel metal plates which define, between them, pockets through which the gas flows. Alternate pockets are connected to carry one of the two gas streams between which heat is to be transferred, and the remaining pockets carry the other gas stream.In order to extend the dwell time of the gases in the heat exchanger, it has been proposed to provide metal baffles in the pockets which extend the length of the gas-flow path through them and are in good thermal contact with the plates. Such an arrangement is disclosed in the Applicant's United States Patent No. 5,078,208. This Patent Specification discloses the feature of providing the parallel plates from a sinuously wound metal foil successive spaced areas of which provide the parallel spaced plates. It has also been proposed in the said Patent to use metal spacers between rectangular plates of a heat exchanger and which are shaped to produce counterflow passages in successive pockets so that the heat exchange efficiency is enhanced (see said Patent, column 8, between lines 36 and 55). Amongst 

other Patents disclosing the use of a sinuously wound metal strip are United States Patent Nos. 4,131 ,159 and 4,343,355.Recent developments in heat-conductive plastics have created interest in the use of plastics materials in place of metals in heat exchangers. Plastics sheeting can be made thinner than metal sheeting so that the reduced heat-transfer co-efficient of the plastics is offset by its reduced thickness. Also, pressing thin metal sheets into different shapes, which is

 CLAIMS
1 . A gas-flow heat exchanger comprising a set of parallel, spaced, heat-conductive areas providing between them a stack of pockets each containing parallel baffles which define a platen of passageways guiding the gas-flow path through the pocket between inlet and outlet openings, the openings being arranged in four parallel lines at the sides of the stack, two of the lines respectively containing the inlet and outlet openings associated with the gas-flow paths of alternate pockets of the stack, while the other two lines respectively contain the inlet and outlet openings associated with the remaining pockets of the stack; in which heat exchanger each pocket contains a removable frame formed with the openings Â° provided at the ends of the gas-flow path through it, and supporting within the frame parallel baffles which divide the gas-flow path into the platen of passageways.
2. A heat exchanger as claimed in claim 1 , in which each frame has its contained baffles supported by webs which are integrally moulded with the frame and baffles from a plastics material.
15 3. A heat exchanger as claimed in claim 2, in which the baffles comprise parallel-sided strips having opposite flat parallel edges engaging the conductive areas forming opposite sides of the pocket, the webs extending inwardly from the frame in its medial plane, and the frame is of flat rectangular shape.
20 4. A heat exchanger as claimed in claim 1 , claims 2 or claim 3, in which the heat conductive areas are provided by spaced sections of a continuous, rectangular flexible foil wound in sinuous fashion to provide the pockets respectively containing successive frames.
5. A heat exchanger as claimed in claim 4, in which the foil is aluminium.
^ 6. A heat exchanger as claimed in claim 5, in which the foil is coated on one side with a hydrophilic coating.
7. A heat exchanger as claimed in any one of the preceding claims, in which the passageways are substantially U-shape and the inlet and outlet openings at the ends of the passageways are .arranged, respectively, in adjacent sides of the frame. 


8. A heat exchanger as claimed in any one of the preceding claims, in which the baffles in neighbouring pockets register with one another substantially throughout their lengths so that the major parts of the passageways in the pockets are substantially aligned with one another and the heat-conductive areas are sandwiched between the edges of neighbouring baffles and are held at their edges between interfitting portions of the frames.
9. A heat exchanger as claimed in any one of the preceding claims, in which each frame is formed along one lower side with apertures for draining liquid from its interior, and the portions of the baffles adjacent said lower frame side have rebates permitting water to flow through the baffles to the lower side of the frame.
1 0. A heat exchanger as claimed in claim 9, incorporated into an air conditioning unit having a labyrinthine structure with associated means for saturating with water vapour a stale air steam leaving a room before the stale air enters one flow path of the heat exchanger.
