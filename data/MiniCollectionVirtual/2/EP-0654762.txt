<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention is in the field of digital radiography.
The invention more specifically relates to an image processing
method applied for the purpose of enhancing the quality of
diagnostic evaluation of a radiographic image.In the field of digital radiography a wide variety of image
acquisition techniques have been developed such as computerised
tomography, nuclear magnetic resonance, ultrasound, detection of a
radiation image by means of a CCD sensor or a video camera,
radiographic film scanning etc. By means of these techniques a
digital representation of a radiographic image is obtained.In still another technique a radiation image, for example an
image of x-rays transmitted by an object, is stored in a screen
comprising a photostimulable phosphor such as one of the phosphors
described in European patent publication 503 702 published on
16.09.92 and US Ser. 07/842,603. The technique for reading out the
stored radiation image consists of scanning the screen with
stimulating radiation, such as laser light of the appropriate
wavelength, detecting the light emitted upon stimulation and
converting the emitted light into an electric representation for
example by means of a photomultiplier and finally digitizing the
signal.The digital images obtained by one of the acquisition techniques
described hereinbefore can be subjected to a wide variety of image
processing techniques.If the unprocessed original image representation is stored, it
can be subjected off-line to different types of image processing
techniques as well as to processing using different values of the
processing parameters as frequently as required.The processed or unprocessed images can further be applied to a
display device and/or can be reproduced by means of an image
recorder such as a laser recorder or the like. For the purpose of display and/or hard copy recording signal
values are converted into density values envisioned in the display
or hard copy according to a signal-to-density mapping curve that has
a predetermined shape in between a minimum and a maximum displayable
or reproducible density value.In some applications radiologists protect their subjects against
unnecessary exposure to X-rays by use of X-ray opaque 'collimation'
material. The material is placed in the path of the X-ray beam so
as to shield those areas of the patient which are not regarded as
diagnostically important. Besides reducing patient dose this
technique has the additional advantage of limiting the amount of
scattered radiation in the image field of
