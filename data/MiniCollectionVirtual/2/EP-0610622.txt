<ABSTRACT>
A wrench tool for preventing cross threading during 
engagement of nuts (9) with studs (11) is provided. A 

driving body (12,18) receives the nut (9) and alignment with 
the stud (11) is effected through a locating 

assembly (22,24,32,36,42) pivotally connected to the driving 
body. The locating assembly is moved out of engagement with 

the stud (11) by the movement of the driving body (12,18) in 
the tightening direction.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to socket wrench tools, and more 
specifically to wrench tools configured to prevent cross 
threading between nuts and studs. It is known that many manufacturing processes call for 
the installation of threaded nuts onto threaded studs. 
Studs are fixed bolts projecting from a work piece for the 
purpose of fastening or location. Studs used in automated 
processes generally have starter points or "dog points" on 
their free end to aid location of the stud with the opening 
in the nut. Typically, a work piece containing a threaded 
stud is moved into a position where the stud is presented to 
receive a threaded nut. The work piece is held in place and 
a wrench tool containing a nut is advanced to the stud where 
the nut engages the dog point. Rotatably turning the nut 
with the wrench causes the nut to be run down the length of 
the stud thereby imparting clamp loads as is typical of 
threaded fasteners. The ideal wrenching process has the 
longitudinal axis of the stud in line with the rotation axis 
of the nut, thereby making it easier to locate the dog point 
and match the treads. For a variety of reasons, misalignments often occur 
between the nut and the stud. A situation of particular 
concern has the nut face tilted away from perpendicularity 
with the axis of the stud. The rotation axis of the nut 
does not line up with the longitudinal axis of the stud 
leading to a mismatching between the nut threads and the 
stud threads. Some tilting of the nut relative to the stud 
can be tolerated without adverse consequences, but 
uncontrolled misalignments usually result in cross 
threading. The threads of the nut permanently damage the 
threads of the stud, or vice versa, by cutting across them 
rendering the fastener system ineffective or unusable. No devices are known which have been developed 
specifically to prevent cross threading by automatically 
limiting misalignment between a nut and a stud and which do not interfere 
with the nut during run down of the nut along the stud. Many other  
 
devices are known however, that permit one handed wrenching 
of nuts and bolts. United States Patent 1,097,288 to 
Bidinger discloses a ratchet wrench adapted with a notched 
portion which holds the head of a bolt thereby preventing 
rotation of the bolt when the nut is run down. This device, 
like others, requires that the nut be applied by hand before 
the tool can be used. United States Patent 1,282,523 to Bauer discloses a 
wrench for applying and removing nuts to bolts in 
inconvenient

<CLAIMS>
A wrench tool for installing threaded nuts on threaded 
studs comprising; 


a socket (18) adapted at one end for rotatable engagement 
with a driver head (14) and adapted at its free end to 

receive the nut (9) such that the nut face is perpendicular 
to the rotation axis of the socket; and 
limiting means for limiting the extent of misalignment 
between the rotation axis of the nut (9) and the 

longitudinal axis of the stud (11) in order to prevent cross 
threading;
 
   characterised in that the limiting means comprise; 
an upper link (24) defining parallel depending arms (26), 
the arms being mounted at one end to the driver head (14) 

for pivotal movement from a base position, the base position 
defined by having the arms (26) extend perpendicularly to 

the rotation axis of the socket (18); 
means (34) for resiliently loading the upper link (24) to 
resist pivotal movement away from the base position; 
an elongate inwardly arched locating link (36) journalled 
at one end to the upper link (24) permitting pivotal 

movement between the upper link (24) and the locating link 
(36), the locating link depending beyond the socket (18) and 

slidably locating the free end of the socket (18) by means 
of an inside arched surface (38) of the locating link; 
means for resiliently loading the locating link (36) to 
maintain slidable locating engagement of the locating link 

(36); and 
a foot element (42) fixed to the free end of the locating 
link (36) for establishing the relative position of the 

longitudinal axis of the stud (11) to the tool, the foot 
element (42) defining a bottom surface (44) for locating a 

work piece surface in surrounding relationship to the stud 
(11) and a V-shaped channel (46) perpendicularly disposed to 

the bottom surface (44) for locating surfaces along the stud 
(11). 
A wrench tool as claimed in claim 1, wherein the socket 
(18) is magnetised. 
A wrench tool as claimed in claim 1 or 2, wherein the 
loading means (34) are leaf springs. 
A wrench tool as claimed in claim 1, 2 or 3, wherein the 
foot element (42) is adapted to carry a generally V-shaped 

tongue for selective accommodation of a variety of stud 
diameters and lengths. 
A wrench tool as claimed in claim 1, 2, 3 or 4, wherein 
the head (14) has a wall element (22) depending parallel to 

and spaced laterally from the socket (18) and terminating 
proximate the free end of the socket (18); 


the inside arched surface (38) of the locating link (36) 
slidably engaging the terminal end of the wall element (22) 

to locate the free end of the socket (18).
