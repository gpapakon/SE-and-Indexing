<ABSTRACT>
DNA encoding 3-phosphoglycerate dehydrogenase (PGD) with reduced sensitivity to inhibition by serine in comparison to wild-type PGD - i.e., the DNA encodes PGD which has at least some level of enzymatic activity useful for biosynthesis, and which retains that activity at higher serine levels than does the (unmodified) wild-type PGD. Also disclosed are: a) PGD having the amino acid sequence of the above-described engineered DNA; b) expression vectors comprising the engineered DNA and regulatory DNA positioned and oriented for expression of the engineered DNA in a host expression system; c) cells comprising such expression vectors; and d) methods for producing serine or a serine-derived product by culturing such cells.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to the general field of biosynthesis 
of serine and products related to serine, particularly 
tryptophan, and to methods and materials used in that 
biosynthesis. Serine is a primary intermediate in the biosynthesis of a 
wide variety of cellular metabolites including such 
economically important compounds as choline, glycine, 
cysteine and tryptophan. In addition, serine acts as a 
single carbon donor and is responsible for 60 - 75% of the 
cell's total need for C₁ units through the production of 
5,10-methylenetetrahydrofolate from tetrahydrofolate. These 
C₁ units are used in a wide variety of biosynthetic pathways 
including the synthesis of methionine, inosine 
monophosphate, other purines and some pyrimidines (e.g. 
thymidine and hydroxymethyl cytidine). The serine biosynthetic pathway shown in Fig. 1 is generally 
available to a wide variety of tissues and microorganisms. 
The first committed step in that pathway is the conversion 
of 3-phospho-D-glyceric acid (PGA) to 3-phosphohydroxypyruvic  
 
acid (PHA) by means of the enzyme 3-phosphoglycerate 
dehydrogenase (PGD). The gene encoding PGD 
has been cloned and sequenced, and the amino acid sequence 
of the PGD subunit has been deduced. Tobey and Grant, J. 
Biol. Chem. 261:12179-12183 (1980). In procaryotes (particularly bacteria) and microorganisms 
such as yeast, but not in higher eukaryotes, activity of 
wild-type PGD is inhibited by cellular serine levels. This 
inhibition has been studied kinetically and reportedly 
proceeds in an allosteric matter. Tobey and Grant, J. Biol. 
Chem., 261:12179-12183 (1986); Dubrow and Pizer, J. Biol. 
Chem. 252:1527-1551 (1977); McKitrick and Pizer, J. 
Bacteriol. 141:235-245 (1980). Tosa and Pizer, J. Bacteriol. 106:972-982 (1971) studied the 
effect of a normally toxic serine analog, L-serine 
hydroxamate, on an E. coli strain. Selection on a growth 
medium containing that analog yielded serine resistant 
mutants. Some mutants were shown to have a modification in 
an enzyme unrelated to PGD, seryl-tRNA synthetase. Crude 
extract of one mutant showed PGD activity with reduced 
serine sensitivity (See J. Bacteriol. 106:972-982 (1971); 
Fig. 5; Table 6; and see p. 973 bottom left col., p. 977 
bottom left col.). One aspect of the invention generally features DNA encoding 
3-phosphoglycerate dehydrogenase (PGD) with reduced 
sensitivity to inhibition by serine in comparison to wild-type 
PGD--i.e., the DNA encodes PGD which has at least some 
level of enzymatic activity useful for
