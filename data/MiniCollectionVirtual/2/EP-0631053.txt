<ABSTRACT>
Disclosed is a compressor having a plate rotatable about an 
axis of a rotary shaft and a piston connected to the plate. 

The plate causes the piston to reciprocate between a top dead 
center and a bottom dead center in accordance with the 

rotation movement of the plate. Cam surfaces are provided 
with the plate for actuating the piston. The cam surfaces 

have first portions for driving the piston toward the top dead 
center, and second portions for driving the piston toward the 

bottom dead center. Transmission members are interposed 
between the piston and the plate for t
ransmitting the rotation 
movement of the plate to the piston. The first and second 

portions cause the transmission members to displace on the cam 
surfaces. At least one of the first and second portions are 

arranged to have a normal line extending obliquely to the axis 
of the rotary shaft for a constant contact between the 

transmission members and the one of the portions.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a wave plate type compressor 
in which a piston reciprocates in response to the rotation of 
a wave plate secured to a rotary shaft. In a conventional swash plate type compressor, one head of a 
double-headed piston completes a single compression cycle for 
every rotation made by the swash plate and the rotary shaft. 
On the other hand, with compressors using a wave plate, one 
head of the double-headed piston completes a plurality of 
compression cycles in accordance with the shapes of the cam 
surfaces or cam grooves on the wave plate for each rotation 
of the rotary shaft. The wave plate type compressors 
therefore have an advantage over the swash plate type 
compressor in that the discharge displacement per rotation is 
increased. Conventional wave plate type compressors are disclosed in 
Japanese Unexamined Patent Publication No. 57-110783 and 
Japanese Unexamined Utility Model Publication No. 63-147571. 
In the compressor described in the Japanese Unexamined Patent 
Publication No. 57-110783, on which the preamble of claim 1 is based, in particular, rollers 53 and 54 
are provided between an associated double-headed piston 52 and 
the front and rear cam surfaces 5la and 51b of a wave plate 
51 as shown in Fig. 13. The rollers 53 and 54 are rotatably 
fitted in the piston 52, and are capable of rolling on the 
wave plate 51. As the wave plate 51 rotates, its cam surfaces  
 
51a and 51b engage and displace the rollers 53 and 54. These 
rollers then transmit this displacement to the piston 52, in 
turn, causing its reciprocation. In the compressor described in the Japanese Unexamined Utility 
Model Publication No. 63-147571, cam grooves are formed on the 
front and rear surfaces of the wave plate instead of the cam 
surfaces. In this publication, balls rather than rollers are 
interposed between the cam groove and double-headed piston. Although the rollers or balls may at first appear to be in 
line contact with the wave plate, a microscopic view reveals 
a plane contact exists between the contacting components due 
to their deformation under pressure. This deformation 
results in the occurrence of the so called "Hertz contact 
which effectively increases the contact area shared between 
the rollers or balls and the wave plate. To improve the durability of the compressor, it is important 
to reduce the contact pressure between the above contacting 
components. This can be done by increasing the length of the 
line contact or reducing the curvature of the contact
