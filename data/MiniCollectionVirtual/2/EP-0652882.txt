<ABSTRACT>
Compounds with herbicidal properties should be effective in the smallest possible concentrations and be rapidly biodegradable. The compounds proposed by the invention are intended for use as herbicices and to meet the above requirements. Proposed are compounds of formula (I), in which R1 to R4 are hydrogen or an optionally substituted organic group and Q is an optionally substituted aromatic group. These compounds are readily biodegradable and have herbicidal properties. The compounds are suitable for use as non-selective herbicides or on crop plants, either pre- or post-germination.

Method for the preparation of anellated
(oxa)hydantoins corresponding to formula I, according

to claim 1,

characterised in that

(a) a compound corresponding to formula II is caused
to react with a compound corresponding to formula

III


wherein R stands for H, (C

4
)alkyl or active
ester, optionally in the presence of an acid

acceptor and optionally in the presence of a
diluent, or
b) a compound corresponding to formula IV is caused
to react with a compound corresponding to formula

V, optionally in the presence of an acid acceptor
and optionally in the presence of a diluent, and 

the reaction product (III) possibly arising as an
intermediate is reacted with a compound

corresponding to formula II optionally in the
presence of an acid acceptor and optionally in

the presence of a diluent, with the formation of
a compound corresponding to formula VI, wherein R

is H, and


this is then converted, with ring closure, into a
compound corresponding to formula I, or
c) a compound corresponding to formula III, wherein

R is H or (C

)alkyl, together with phosgene
or a phosgene substitute, is first of all

converted into a compound corresponding to
formula VII and then this, together with a

compound corresponding to formula VIII, is
converted to a compound corresponding to formula

VI, 


from which, with ring closure, a compound
corresponding to formula I is obtained, or
d) a compound corresponding to formula II is caused
to react with a compound corresponding to formula

IX, optionally in the presence of a diluent,
whereby a compound corresponding to formula X



is obtained, which is then hydrolysed and
converted, with ring closure, to a compound

corresponding to formula I, or
e) a compound corresponding to formula XI 


wherein X is O, S, NH,

is caused to react with a compound corresponding
to formula XII, XIII or XIV



wherein Z is an atom of chlorine, bromine or
iodine, so that a compound corresponding to

formula I is obtained.
