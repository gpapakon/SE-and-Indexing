<ABSTRACT>
Screw-type dental implant for screwing into a reception hole in the jaw. Known screw-type dental implants (81) have a head region whose design results in crushing of the gums on screwing it into the reception hole in the jaw. Such crushing delays healing-in of the screw-type dental implant (81) in the jaw. The screw-type dental implant (81) according to the invention has a central section (83) with a screw thread of lower depth. This results in widening of the gums before screwing-in of the threadless head section (84) of the screw-type dental implant (81) in the reception hole in the jaw. The screw-type dental implant (81) according to the invention is particularly suitable for forming a base to be implanted in the jaw for fastening of dental components, for example artificial individual teeth and prostheses.

<CLAIMS>
Screw-type dental implant for fastening dentures
to the jaw, having a dental implant body, which can be

screwed at least partly into the jaw and in which a
tool-locating means (86) for screwing the dental implant

into place is arranged and which has an outer surface
which at its bottom part is provided at least partly

with an external thread for forming a threaded section
(82) and has a thread-free section (84) at a top part, a

centre section (83) having a thread of smaller depth
being arranged between the head section (84) and the

threaded section (82), characterized in that the tool-locating
means (86) for screwing the dental implant into

place extends through the head section (84) and at least
over most of the centre section (83) having the thread

of smaller depth.
Screw-type dental implant according to Claim 1,
characterized in that the thread-free head section (84)

has a smaller diameter than the threaded section (82).
Screw-type dental implant according to Claim 2,
characterized in that the minor diameter (dm) of the

centre section (83) corresponds approximately to the
diameter of the head section (84).
Screw-type dental implant according to one of
the preceding claims, characterized in that the centre

section (83) is longer than the head section (84).
Screw-type dental implant according to one of
the preceding claims, characterized in that the tool-locating

means is designed as a hexagon socket (86).
Screw-type dental implant according to Claim 5, 
characterized in that the hexagon socket (86) is located

slightly below an end face (22), to the outside of the
jaw, of the dental implant body (21).
Screw-type dental implant according to Claim 5
or 6, characterized in that there is a frustoconical

widened portion between the end face (22) and the
hexagon socket (86), and this frustoconical widened

portion tapers in the direction of the hexagon socket
(86).
