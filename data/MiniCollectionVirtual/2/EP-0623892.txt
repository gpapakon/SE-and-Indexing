<ABSTRACT>
When vibration is entered on a vibration 
transmitting tablet, the vibration is sensed by 

vibration sensors attached at four corners of the 
tablet. When this is done, a time delay from entry of 

the vibration to detection thereof is measured, and the 
distance between each sensor and the source of the 

vibration is calculated in dependence upon the time 
delay. At this time the vibration sensors also sense 

reflected waves resulting from reflection of the 
vibration at the end face of the tablet. The larger the 

angle of reflection, the greater the magnitude of the 
reflected waves sensed. Accordingly, sensors must 

likely to sense reflected waves are excluded from 
calculation, and coordinates are calculated based upon 

vibration sensed by the remaining sensors only. As a 
consequence, a discontinuity in coordinates occurs at 

the boundary of a region decided by whichever of the 

sensors are excluded. For this reason, a weighted mean 
is computed of a set of coordinates calculated based 

upon data obtained from a set of a plurality of sensors, 
and the value of the weighted mean is adopted as the 

coordinates sought.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a coordinate input
apparatus and, more particularly, to a coordinate input
apparatus in which elastic-wave vibration that has been
entered from a vibrating pen is sensed by a plurality of
vibration sensors provided on a vibration transmitting
tablet, and the coordinates of a point at which
vibration is entered by the vibrating pen is sensed
based upon a time delay in the elastic-wave input to the
vibration transmitting tablet from the vibrating pen.Ordinarily, in an apparatus of this type, the time
delays required for the vibration generated by the
vibrating pen to reach vibration sensors provided at
prescribed positions of the vibration transmitting
tablet are measured, and the distances from the
vibrating pen to the vibration sensors and, hence, the
coordinates designated by the vibrating pen, are
calculated based upon the measured values.Vibration detected by a vibration sensor contains,
in addition to a direct-wave component that reaches the
vibration sensor directly upon being generated by the 
vibrating pen, a reflected-wave component that reaches
the vibration sensor upon being reflected at, say, the
end face of the vibration transmitting tablet.
Components other than the direct-wave component needed
for coordinate calculation are unnecessary components
and result in erroneous calculation of coordinates. For
this reason, it is required that the effects of the
unnecessary reflected-wave component be reduced. In
order to suppress the level of reflected waves, an
expedient used in the art is to attenuate the reflected
waves by affixing a vibration suppressor in the
proximity of the end face of the vibration transmitting
tablet. Despite this arrangement, however, there are
cases in which the effects of reflected waves appear
when the external configuration of the coordinate input
unit is made small in size. Specifically, when the
apparatus is made compact, the effective area of the
apparatus approaches the vibration suppressor.
Consequently, when vibration generated by the vibrating
pen is reflected at the boundary of the vibration
suppressor and the resulting reflected waves arrive at a
vibration sensor, these reflected waves exhibit a large
angle of incidence with respect to the vibration
suppressor. When the angle of incidence approaches 90Â°,
the reflectivity at the boundary where the vibration
suppressor is affixed approaches 1. Accordingly, there 
are instances where the level of the reflected waves is
enlarged, as a result of which coordinates are sensed
erroneously
