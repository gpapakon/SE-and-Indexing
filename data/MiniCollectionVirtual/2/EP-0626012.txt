<ABSTRACT>
Homozygotic cells are obtained by employing homologous recombination with a construct comprising a marker gene. The marker gene allows for selection without amplification and by employing elevated levels of the antibiotic to which the marker gene imparts resistance, gene conversion can occur, where in a diploid host, both copies of the target locus will be the same. In this manner, knock-outs of genes can be readily achieved without requiring two steps of homologous recombination.

<DESCRIPTION>
The field of this invention is directed targeting of
genes in viable cells.There are continuing advances in the ability to modify
cells. One of the most exciting areas for the treatment of
genetic diseases is gene therapy. In those situations where
cells can be isolated, which are relatively long-lived and
can be grown in culture and expanded, one has the
opportunity to isolate such cells from a host, either the
diseased host or an allogeneic host. The cells may then be
grown in culture, expanded, and modified by homologous
recombination, and the modified cells restored to the host.In other situations, one wishes to produce products
which are exogenous to the host. In this situation, one may
modify embryonic stem cells, add them to a blastocyst, and
then produce a chimeric host. This chimeric host may then
be mated and the progeny either used as heterozygous mutants
or further mated to produce homozygous mutants. By
providing for appropriate changes in the embryonic cells,
one can produce various human proteins in bovine milk and
the like.Alternatively, one may wish to change the nature or
characteristics of a product of a host, such as meat,
vegetable oils, size, or the like. In many cases,
homologous recombination will be required with both genes, 
since the host will be diploid. This means that one must go
through an extensive number of steps in first modifying one
gene, ensuring that the proper modification has occurred,
then using the modified cells to repeat the process and
modify the second gene. Even where the modification is a
knock-out, namely introduction of an interfering sequence
and/or deletion into the target locus, the process can be
time-consuming and labor-intensive. There is, therefore,
substantial interest in being able to develop techniques
which allow for improvements in the efficiency of achieving
genetic modifications at target loci.Procedures for the modification of ES cells and
detection of the modified cells may be found in Mortensen,
et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. (USA) 88, 7036-7040 (1991).
Paludan, et al., Gene 85, 421-426 (1989) reports enhanced
resistance of cells comprising multiple neo genes.
Spontaneous production of homozygous cells from heterozygous
cultured cells have been reported by Nelson, et al., Mol.
Cell. Biol. 9, 1284-1288 (1989); Potter, et al., Proc. Natl.
Acad. Sci. (USA) 84, 1634-1637 (1987); Rajan, et al., J.
Immunol. 145, 1598-1602 (1990) and Campbell, et al., Mol.

A method for modifying eukaryotic cells to be homozygous
at a target locus, said method comprising:


introducing into host cells a construct, said construct
comprising a marker gene flanked by regions of homology to

said target locus, to produce a mixture of cells comprising
modified cells in which said construct is homologously

recombined at a single target site, wherein said marker gene
is a non-amplifiable gene which confers on said modified cells

a preferential ability to grow in a selective medium;
selecting cells comprising said construct by means of
said marker gene by growing said cells in selective medium at

a first level of selective agent and analyzing viable cells
for homologous recombination to provide a substantially pure

population of modified cells which have undergone homologous
recombination at one or more target loci;
subjecting said population of modified cells to a level
of selective agent greater than said first level, whereby a

recombination event occurs to provide cells homozygous for
said marker gene at said target locus; and
isolating said homozygotic cells.
A method for modifying mammalian cells to be homozygous
at a target locus, said method comprising:


introducing into mammalian host cells a construct, said
construct comprising a marker gene flanked by regions of

homology to said target locus, to produce a mixture of cells
comprising modified cells in which said construct is

homologously recombined at a single target site, wherein said
marker gene is an antibiotic resistance gene which confers on

said modified cells a preferential ability to grow in a
selective medium;
selecting cells comprising said construct by means of

said marker gene by growing said cells in selective medium at 
a first level of antibiotic and analyzing viable cells for

homologous recombination to provide a substantially pure
population of modified cells which have undergone homologous

recombination at one or more target loci;
expanding said pure population of modified cells;
subjecting said expanded population of modified cells to

A method according to any one of the preceding claims,
wherein said target locus is a surface membrane protein locus.
A method according to claim 7 wherein said cells are non-human
ES cells and which method further comprises injecting a

said cell into a non-human blastocyst which is brought to term
in a non-human female host to recover a chimeric progeny.
A method according to claim 8 wherein said ES cell is a
murine ES cell. 
A method for providing a cultured mammalian cell
containing a homozygous disruption at a target locus

comprising two copies of the same endogenous gene, wherein
