<ABSTRACT>
Process for the removal of mercury from hydrocarbons by passing the feedstock with hydrogen over a catalyst and then placing the product obtained in contact with a solid scavenger for mercury, the catalyst containing at least one element chosen from the group consisting of iron, nickel, cobalt, molybdenum, tungsten and palladium, in which at least 5 % is combined in the sulphide state. The arsenic which may be present in the feedstock is also removed. According to the invention the catalyst is simultaneously presulphurised and reduced. The invention makes it possible to obtain a large reduction in the period for reaching operating conditions and good scavenging efficiency at temperatures between 120 and 250@C and in the presence of 0-1000 mg of sulphur/kg of feedstock.

A process for the elimination of mercury and, if
present, arsenic from a hydrocarbon feedstock comprising

from 0 to 1000 mg of sulphur/kg, wherein the feedstock,

in the presence of hydrogen, is brought into contact
with a catalyst constituted by at least one metal and a

support, the product obtained then being brought into
contact with a mercury retention bed comprising sulphur

or a metallic sulphide, characterised in that the presulphurated
catalyst comprises at least one metal selected from the

group formed by iron, nickel, cobalt, molybdenum,
tungsten, chromium and palladium, at least 5 % by weight

of said metal or metals being in the form of its
sulphide, and in that the catalyst is obtained in a

first step by impregnation of a catalyst precursor
comprising said supported metal or metals in the

metallic and/or oxide form, using an aqueous or organic
solution or an aqueous or organic suspension comprising

a reducing agent and at least one sulphur containing
agent selected from the group constituted by


at least one organic polysulphide which may if
necessary be mixed with elemental sulphur,
at least one organic disulphide which may if
necessary be mixed with elemental sulphur, 
at least one organic or inorganic sulphide which
may if necessary be mixed with elemental sulphur,
elemental sulphur,

said impregated precursor then being thermally treated
in a second step,

and in that contact with the catalyst takes place at a
temperature of 120°C to 250°C and a pressure of 1 to 40

bars, and that the contact with the retention bed takes
place at a temperature of less than 220°C and volume

flow of 1 to 50 h
-1
.
Process according to claim 1, characterised in that
the hydrogen flowrate with respect to the catalyst is

between 1 and 500 volumes of gas per volume of catalyst
per hour.
Process according to any one of the preceding claims,
characterised in that the feedstock comprises from 0 to 5 mg

of arsenic per kilogram of feedstock.
Process according to any one of the preceding
claims, characterised in that the volume ratio of

catalyst to retention bed is between 1:10 and 5:1. 
Process according to any one of the preceding
claims, characterised in that the metal of the catalyst

is nickel.
Process according to any one of the preceding
claims, characterised in that the metals of the catalyst

are nickel and palladium.
Process according to any one of the preceding
claims, characterised in that the support is selected

from the group constituted by alumina, aluminosilicates,
silica, zeolites, activated carbon, clays and alumina

cements.
Process according to any one of the preceding
claims, characterised in that the sulphur is obtained by

offsite impregnation of the catalytic precursor using at
least one sulphur containing liquid selected from the

group constituted by ammonium sulphide, a colloidal
suspension of sulphur in water, an organic solution of

sulphur, an organic solution of a sulphur containing
compound or compounds. 
Process according to any one of the preceding claims,
characterised in that the feedstock comprises 10
-3
 to 5 mg
of arsenic per kilogram of feedstock.
Process according to any one of the preceding
claims, characterised in that the feedstock is brought

into contact with the catalyst at a temperature of 130-200°C.
Process according to any one of the preceding
claims, characterised in that the precursor obtained is

reduced in hydrogen at 120-600°C before being brought
into contact with the feedstock.
Process according to any one of the preceding
claims, characterised in that the precursor is thermally

treated at a temperature of between 100°C and 200°C in
the second step.
Process according to any one of the preceding claims,
characterised in that at most 50 % by weight of the

metal(s) of the catalyst is in the form of sulfide.
