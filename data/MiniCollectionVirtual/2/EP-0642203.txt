<ABSTRACT>
The induction charging apparatus has a power 
source unit (12) and a device unit (18) which can be 

detachably coupled to the power source unit (12). The 
power source unit (12) has a first casing (22) having one 

end opened, a primary coil (14) provided in the first 
casing, an oscillator (38) for supplying an alternating 

current to the primary coil to generate magnetic fluxes, 
and a depressible member (78) movably provided and closing 

the open end of the first casing. The depressible member 
is movable between a lift position at which the magnetic 

fluxes are substantially located under the depressible 
member (78), and a depressed position at which portions of 

the magnetic fluxes are substantially located over the 

depressible member (78). The device unit (18) has a second 
casing (24) having one end detachable to the open end of 

the first casing, a secondary coil (16) provided in the 
second casing and adjacent to the one end, and rechargeable 

battery (30) provided in said second casing for receiving 
power from the secondary coil (16). When the second casing 

is attached to the first casing, the depressible member 
(78) is moved to the depressed position to electromagnetically 

couple the primary and secondary coils.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an induction 
charging apparatus for use in various kinds of electric apparatuses 
such as, portable game machines, power-driven 
tooth brushes, electric tools, or the like and, more particularly, 
to an induction charging device having a power 
source unit and a battery unit detachably connected to the 
power source unit for the supply of electric power from a 
commercial power source through the power source unit to 
the battery unit, utilizing the electromagnetic induction 
coupling between the power source unit and the battery 
unit. EP-A-0 298 707 discloses an example of an induction charging apparatus for charging a watch battery. A coil in the charger casing induces a magnetic flux which links with a coil in the watch casing. In the conventional arrangement of induction 
charging apparatuses of the aforementioned type, a secondary 
battery (rechargeable battery) is installed in a unit 
of the device. Normally, the unit of the device is set to 
a power source and prepared to stand a short-term driving 
load while the secondary battery is kept charged with a 
minute current from the power source. Therefore, a primary 
oscillator section, e.g., an inverter circuit or the like 
at the side of the power source is always held in the 
driving state, and at the same time, the output of the 
primary oscillator section is controlled depending on the 
presence/absence of the load in the device unit so as to 
save power in case the device unit is separated from the 
power source for a long time. In the arrangement as above, in the case where 
the available output power from the primary oscillator 
section is increased and if a metallic element such as a 
clip or the like, instead of the device unit, is brought 
close to a primary coil, the metallic element is erroneously 
recognized as a proper load. In consequence, an  
 
excessive amount of eddy current is fed and heat is 
generated. The inventors have discovered from the studies of 
the aforementioned inconvenience that, when the primary 
oscillator section is maintained always in the driving 
state and the primary coil is accommodated in the power 
source unit while being separated from a touching face 
thereof to the power source, the magnetic flux density at 
the peripheral surface of a main casing can be made as 
small as possible, and moreover, if a touching face of the 
power source is made movable to the primary coil in the 
interlocking movement with setting of the device unit to 
the power source, the above
