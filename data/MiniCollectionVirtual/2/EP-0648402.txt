<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a microcellular radio network comprising a plurality of base transceiver stations (BTS) and higher-level network elements, such as base station controllers (BSC) and exchanges (MSC), and an SDH transmission network. The base transceiver stations (BTS) and higher-level network elements (MSC, BSC) are connected to nodes (16) of the SDH network for dynamic establishment of digital transmission links. The network management (TMN) of the SDH network is capable of dynamic allocation of transmission capacity of the transmission network to base transceiver stations or higher-level network elements according to their traffic load. The traffic load is determined on the basis of the number of transmission channels in use and those not in use, or on the basis of load information otained from the network management of the radio network.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a microcellular radio
network comprising a plurality of base transceiver
stations and higher-level network elements, such as base
station controllers and exchanges, and a transmission
network having node means to which the base transceiver
stations and higher-level network elements are connected
for dynamic establishment of digital transmission
links between the network elements and the base
transceiver stations.At present, different kinds of cellular radio
or mobile phone systems are in use or under development,
in which systems the geographical area covered by the
network is divided into separate smaller radio areas
called radio cells in such a manner that when a radio
telephone or mobile radio station is located within the
cell, it communicates with the fixed network through a
fixed radio station, or base station, located in the
radio cell. The mobile stations belonging to the system
may roam freely within the area of the system from one
cell to another. The base stations are connected,
normally with fixed transmission links (e.g. PCM links),
to a mobile exchange either directly or via an intermediate
base station controller, which controls the base
station system including several base stations. Each
base station is provided with a fixed number of traffic
channels for setting up calls with mobile stations via
a radio path. The transmission link interconnecting a
base station and a mobile exchange contains a fixed
number of transmission channels equal to the number of
traffic channels of the base station. The traffic load 
caused by mobile stations in cellular radio networks is
highly statistical: all available radio channels and
traffic channels are never in use at the same time. In
practice it is very difficult to predict beforehand
where the highest traffic load will be located geographically.
Therefore in conventional macrocellular
networks a fixed number of transmission channels equal
to the number of traffic channels of the base station
has been allocated for the transmission link between the
base station and the switching centre.In densely populated areas with a high traffic
load the aim is to achieve a cellular network that
offers more efficient utilization of radio channels by
employing very small and correspondingly a larger number
of radio cells. Such a microcellular network comprises
a huge number of base stations, wherefore it is practically
impossible to predict the distribution of traffic
load. On the other hand, the number of traffic channels
of the base
