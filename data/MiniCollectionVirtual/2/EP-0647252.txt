<ABSTRACT>
A process for activating vulcanized waste rubber particles by treating the waste rubber particles with a rubber latex and a curing system and drying the treated waste rubber particles. The waste rubber particles are preferably treated with 1 to 4 % by weight of rubber latex (calculated as dry substance) and 0.5 to 3 % by weight of sulfur as vulcanizing agent, both being calculated on the waste rubber particles. The treatment is carried out conveniently by mixing the waste rubber particles with the vulcanizing agent, adding the latex at a temperature of from 70 to 90  DEG C and stirring the obtained mixture for 5 to 10 min. so as to evaporate the water. Also disclosed are processes for producing a rubber-like article by molding the activated waste rubber particles, whether or not mixed with a non-vulcanized rubber compound, while applying heat and pressure.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a process for activating 
vulcanized (cured) waste rubber particles by treating the 
waste rubber particles with a non-vulcanized rubber 
polymer and a vulcanizing agent. In order to prevent that waste rubber and in particular 
the growing quantity of scrapped automobile tires become 
damaging to the environment, it is highly desirable to 
recycle this material. Recycling of waste rubber can be 
carried out by grinding and adding the waste rubber particles 
to rubber mixtures for manufacturing new products. 
This process, however, leads to a strong deterioration of 
the physical properties. Another method of recycling is to 
reclaim the waste rubber in which the network formed by 
vulcanization, is thermally degraded. The reclaimed 
material can be added to rubber mixtures for manufacturing 
new products. This process leads to a loss of physical 
properties either, because the properties of the reclaimed 
material are poor in comparison with virgin polymers which 
is caused by the random decomposition of the network 
during reclaiming.  
 US patent specification 4,481,335 proposes a process for 
activating cured waste rubber particles. In this process 
100 parts by weight of particulate, cured rubber are mixed 
with from 1 to 5 parts by weight of a liquid, sulfurcurable 
polymeric binder having ethylenic unsaturation and 
being soluble in hexane and/or benzene and having a 
viscosity at 140°C of not greater than about 10⁶cp, and 
with a curing agent in a quantity of from 50 to 500% by 
weight of the polymeric binder. The polymeric binder is preferably a homopolymer or copolymer 
of 1,4-butadiene. The applied polymers have a molecular 
weight of from 1000 to 100,000, and preferably from 
1000 to 50,000. The polymeric binder is obtained by drying 
a commercially available aqueous emulsion, e.g. by stirring 
the emulsion in a Waring mixer at approximately 65°C. 
The curing agent may be any of the curing agents commonly 
used, such as sulfur or sulfur donors. The waste rubber 
particles, the polymeric binder and the curing agent are 
mixed at a temperature of approximately 60 to 140°C until 
a homogeneous, dry mixture is obtained. The obtained activated waste rubber particles can be added 
in a quantity of preferably 25 to 75% by weight to rubber 
mixtures for producing rubber-like products, wherein the 
loss of physical properties is considerably reduced in 
comparison with the application of untreated waste rubber 
particles. The subsequent PCT-application WO 88/02313 of the same
