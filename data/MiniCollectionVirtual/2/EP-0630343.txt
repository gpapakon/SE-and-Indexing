Stack of annular- or annular disc-shaped component 
parts (10) which are provided with a radial slot (11), 

such as securing rings or the like, which are lined-up 
on a packing (20) with identically orientated radial 

slots (11), said packing being inserted into the inner 
receiving means of the component parts (10), the packing 

(20) having a guide element (21a, 22a), which extends 
over the length of the stack and is retained in the 

aligned radial slots (11) by means of a supporting 
element securely connected thereto, and the supporting 

element being supported on the inner receiving means of 
the component parts (10), and a front end of the packing 

(20) being provided with abutment elements (21b, 22b), 
against which the facing component part (10) of the 

stack abuts in a surface-to-surface manner, 
characterised in that the guide element (21a, 22a) and 

the supporting element are parts of an integral piece of 
sheet metal angled in the longitudinal direction, the 

supporting element being supported by two supporting 
edges (24, 26) symmetrically relative to the radial 

slots (11) on the inner contour of the component parts 
(10) with some clearance in the transverse direction, so 

that the guide element (21a) is securely retained in the 
radial slots (11) in a limited adjustable manner. 
Stack according to claim 1, characterised in 
that the other front end of the packing (20) is provided 

with receiving means (27) for a securing element which 
non-detachably secures the component parts (10) which 

are lined-up on the packing (20). 
Stack according to claim 2, characterised in 
that the receiving means (27) are configured as bores,  

 
which are aligned with one another, for receiving a 

closure pin serving as a securing element. 
Stack according to one of claims 1 to 3, 
characterised in that the end of the packing (20) having 

the securing element is provided with insert members 
(28), whic
h are adapted to recesses (41, 42) in a 
subsequent treatment device (40). 
Stack according to one of claims 1 to 4, 
characterised in that, for component parts (10) which 

are configured as internal securing rings, the packing 
(20) is formed as a piece of sheet metal which has been 

angled in a V-shaped manner and is introduced by its 
bent edge into the radial slots (11) in the component 

parts (10), in that the lateral portions (21, 22) form, 
with the portions communicating with the bent edge, the 

guide element (21a, 22a) which defines with a pair of 
supporting edges (23, 25) the displacement of the 

packing (20) in a direction from the radial slots (11), 
in that the free edges of the lateral portions (21, 22) 

form an additional pair of supporting edges (24, 26), 
which define the displacement of the packing (20) in a 

direction into the interior of the component parts (10), 
and in that the abutment elements (21b, 22b) are angled 

at a front end of the packing (20). 
Stack according to claim 5, characterised in 
that the supporting edges (23, 25) of the guide element 

(21a, 22a) abut against the edges of the radial portions 
(11) of the component parts (10), and in that the 

lateral portions (21, 22) are supported on the inner 
contour of the component parts (10) by their supporting  

 
edges (24, 26) in the region of the diameter lying 

perpendicular to the radial slots (11). 
Stack according to claim 5 or 6, characterised 
in that the abutment elements (21b, 22b) extend with the 

same width over the entire width of the lateral portions 
(21, 22) of the packing (20). 
Stack according to one of claims 1 to 4, 
characterised in that, for component parts which are 

configured as external securing rings, the packing is a 
piece of sheet metal which has been bent in a V-shaped 

manner, wherein a strip-like, double-layered and 
continuous guide element is formed in the region of the 

point by its lateral portions being partially folded 
over one another.
