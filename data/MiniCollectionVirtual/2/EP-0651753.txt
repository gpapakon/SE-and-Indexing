<DESCRIPTION>
 Novel P ridonecarboxylic Acid Derivatives and Processes for Preparing the SameTechnical FieldThe present invention relates to novel pyridonecarboxylic acid derivatives which have a broad antibacterial spectrum. The present invention also relates to processes for preparing these compounds.Background ArtA number of pyridonecarboxylic acid-type antibacterials are known. Of these ofloxacin is known to exhibit an excellent antibacterial activity and possesses superior characteristics in bioavailability and efficacy as compared to other quinolone antibacterials. However, ofloxacin suffers from the disadvantage that although it is active against Gram-negative bacteria, it exhibits relatively weak antibacterial activity against Grαw-positive bacteria.Disclosure of nventionThe compounds of the present invention have a broad antibacterial activit)The present invention provides compounds of Formula (I);
whereinR,, R2, R3 and R4 may be the same or different and represent independently hydrogen or lower alkyl,X represents oxygen or sulfur,Y represents hydrogen or methyl, n denotes an integer of 0 or 1, and stereoisomers thereof, and pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof.Another object of the present invention is to provide stereospecific compounds of Formula (la) and Formula (lb):wherein R,, R2, R3, R,, X and n are as defined above, or a racemic mixture thereof.Another object of the present invention is to provide processes for preparing compounds of Formula (I) above.The present invention is further explained hereinbelow. 

 In accordance with the present invention, compounds of Formula (I) can be prepared by reacting a compound of Formula (II) with a compound (III) as illustrated in the following reaction diagram:in the above formulae,R,, R2, R3, R4, X, Y and n are as defined above, and Z is a leaving group such as fluoro.15The term "lower alkyl" used herein refers to a straight or branched Cj-3 alkyl, such as methyl, ethy. n-propyl or isopropyl.As stated above, compounds of Formula (I) can be prepared by the reaction _n of a compound of Formula (II) above and a compound of Formula (III).The process may be carried out in the presence of a solvent. Suitable solvents include acetonitrile, dimethylformamide, dimethylsulfoxide, pyridine, water, an alcohol and mixtures thereof.25The process is preferably carried out in the presence of a base that can bind the side product of the reaction, e.g., a hydrogen fluoride gas.Suitable bases for this purpose include inorganic bases such as potassium -,n carbonate and
