<ABSTRACT>
The invention provides an immobilised oligopeptide for detecting protein 
prenylation consisting of an oligopeptide containing the amino acid 

sequence Xad-Xac-Xab-Xaa-OH at its carboxyl-terminus, at least one of 
Xaa, Xab, Xac and Xad representing cysteine (Cys), said sequence being 

capable of acting as a substrate for a prenyl transferase catalysing 
protein preny
lation, and being bonded to a solid carrier, preferably at 
its amino-terminus. The invention further provides a kit for detecting 

protein prenylation comprising a first immobilised oligopeptide as 
mentioned above and a second immobilised oligopeptide which differs from 

said first immobilised oligopeptide in that the cysteine residue is 
substituted by another amino acid. Also provided are antibodies against 

the prenylated oligopeptides.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention is in the field of biochemical analysis. In 
particular, the invention relates to an immobilised oligopeptide and to 
a kit containing this immobilized oligopeptide for determining protein 
isoprenylating activity in biological samples. Mammalian cell proteins can undergo post-translational modification 
by derivatisation of carboxyl-terminal cysteine residues by 
mevalonate-derived isoprenyl groups. Several of these isoprenylated 
proteins were identified as belonging to groups of related proteins: e.g. 
the nuclear lamins, low molecular weight GTP binding proteins, such as 
the ras-oncogene proteins and heteromeric G proteins. The polyisoprenyl 
group that was attached to a protein was identified as farnesyl (C₁₅) or 
geranylgeranyl (C₂₀), depending on the recognition of the C-terminal amino 
acid sequence of the proteins involved. Lamins and p21ras proteins, which 
possess the consensus CAAX motif (C = cysteine, A = any amino acid having 
an aliphatic side chain and X = any amino acid), are farnesylated, while 
several members of the rab proteins having C-terminal CC or CXC motifs, 
and of the heteromeric G-protein γ-subunits are geranylgeranylated. 
Reviews of the post-translational modification of proteins by isoprenoids 
in mammalian cells are given by Maltese W.A. in FASEB J.4 3319-3328 
(1990) and Casey P.J. in J. Lipid Res. 33 1731-1740 (1992). The isoprenylation of these proteins seems to play a role in their 
association with membranes and nuclear envelopes, where they are processed 
further and/or perform their function. This was shown for example 
by blocking the mevalonate synthesis by HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors, 
which prevented proteolytic processing of the lamin A precursor (Beck et 
al., J. Cell. Biol.110 (1990) 1489-1499) or resulted, in other studies, 
in the accumulation of non-isoprenylated p21ras precursor and the loss of 
transforming activity of oncogenic ras proteins. The latter observation 
triggered the search for specific inhibitors of the farnesylation of 
p21ras in order to prevent its action in cells, where overexpression of 
this protein leads to tumour development, such as in colon carcinomas. G proteins play a role in the receptor-mediated transduction of 
signals (such as growth modulation signals) over the plasma membrane, and 
other isoprenylated proteins, not yet identified, may have a function in  
 
cell cycle progression. There is evidence as well that GTP binding 
proteins are involved in the regulation of intracellular protein traffic
