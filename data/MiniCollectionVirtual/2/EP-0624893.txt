<ABSTRACT>
In a magnet arrangement suitable for providing PPM focusing, cylindrical 
magnets 4 have inclined inner faces 6 and 7 meeting at an edge 8. Pole pieces 9 

are contiguous with the inclined faces 6 and 7 to provide a relatively large field 
within the volume enclosed by the arrangement. Preferably, the magnet is of a 

type II magnetic material.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to magnet arrangements and is more particularly, but 
not exclusively, applicable to periodic permanent magnetic (PPM) focusing stacks. PPM focusing is used to confine and focus a beam of charged particles to 
oppose mutual charge repulsion and prevent the particles colliding with the walls of 
a surrounding structure. Such arrangements may be employed in linear electron 
beam tube devices such as travelling wave tubes (TWTs) and klystrons. A PPM 
stack consists of a plurality of cylindrical magnets arranged about a common 
longitudinal axis and defining a central aperture along which the beam to be 
focused is directed. Adjacent magnets have opposite polarities so as to produce a 
magnetic field having an amplitude which varies sinusoidally in the axial direction. 
One such conventional arrangement is schematically illustrated in Figure 1, which 
is a longitudinal section showing only half of the arrangement which is cylindrically 
symmetrical about its longitudinal axis X-X. Adjacent magnets 1 have opposite polarities as indicated by the arrows 
and are interposed with annular pole piece discs 2 which are of a soft 
ferromagnetic material, typically iron. The pole pieces provide a path for the 
magnetic flux and concentrate the magnetic field in the aperture at the centre of the 
arrangement. Cylindrical spacers 3 are included within the magnets 1 and serve to  
 
accurately locate the magnets 1 to prevent radial movement. The spacers have an 
internal diameter which is substantially the same as that of the pole piece discs 2 
and are of a non-magnetic material, for example nickel, such they do not affect the 
magnetic field configuration. Although as shown, the components of the stack 
arrangement are in a close touching relationship, in practice, there are often small 
gaps between them. The present invention arose from an attempt to provide an improved 
magnet arrangement which is particularly useful for PPM focusing stacks. 
However, it is envisaged that the inventive arrangement may be advantageously 
employed in other applications. According to the invention, there is provided a magnet arrangement 
comprising: cylindrical magnet means surrounding a volume and having a 
longitudinal axis with a radially inner face portion inclined relative to the longitudinal 
axis and end face portions making larger angles with the axis; and pole piece 
means including a portion substantially contiguous with the inclined inner face 
portion for concentrating the magnet field in the said
