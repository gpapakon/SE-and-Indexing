<ABSTRACT>
Apparatus for electrostatic clamping of a semiconductor wafer (12). In a first embodiment, the apparatus includes an electrically conductive platen (110), a resilient, thermally-conductive dielectric layer (14) affixed to the platen (12) and one or more conductive wires (20, 22, 24) positioned on the clamping surface (18). In a second embodiment, a three-phase wafer clamping apparatus includes a platen (90) divided into three electrically isolated sections (92, 94, 96). One phase of a three-phase clamping voltage is connected to each of the platen sections (92, 94, 96). In a third embodiment, a six phase wafer clamping apparatus includes a platen (200) having six symmetrically located electrodes (210, 212, 214, 216, 218, 220). Voltages with six different phases are applied to the electrodes (210, 212, 214, 216, 218, 220) with the voltages applied to electrodes on opposite sides of the platen being one-half cycle out of phase. The applied voltages are preferably bipolar square waves.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to apparatus for
processing semiconductor wafers and, more
particularly, to apparatus for electrostatic
clamping of semiconductor wafers in a vacuum
processing chamber. The apparatus of the invention
is particularly useful in ion implantation systems,
but is not limited to such use.In the fabrication of integrated circuits, a
number of well-established processes involve the
application of ion beams to semiconductor wafers in
vacuum. These processes include, for example, ion
implantation, ion beam milling and reactive ion
etching. In each instance, a beam of ions is
generated in a source and is directed with varying 
degrees of acceleration toward a target wafer. Ion
implantation has become a standard technique for
introducing conductivity-altering impurities into
semiconductor wafers. A desired impurity material
is ionized in an ion source, the ions are
accelerated to form an ion beam of prescribed energy
and the ion beam is directed at the surface of the
wafer. The energetic ions in the beam penetrate
into the bulk of the semiconductor material and are
embedded in the crystalline lattice of the
semiconductor material to form a region of desired
conductivity.The target mounting site is a critical part of
an ion implantation system. The target mounting
site is required to firmly clamp a semiconductor
wafer in a fixed position for ion implantation and,
in most cases, to provide cooling of the wafer. In
addition, means must be provided for exchanging
wafers after completion of ion implantation.
Cooling of wafers is particularly important in
commercial semiconductor processing wherein a major
objective is to achieve a high throughput in terms
of wafers processed per unit time. One way to
achieve high throughput is to use a high current ion
beam so that the implantation process is completed
in a shorter time. However, large amounts of heat
are likely to be generated by the high current ion
beam. The heat can result in uncontrolled diffusion
of impurities beyond prescribed limits in the wafer
and in degradation of patterned pnotoresist layers. It is usually necessary to provide wafer cooling in
order to limit the maximum wafer temperature to
about 100Â°C.A number of techniques for clamping a
semiconductor wafer at the target mounting site are
known in the art. According to one well-known
technique, the wafer is clamped against a platen by
a peripheral clamping ring which engages the outer
periphery of the front surface of the wafer. The
front surface of the wafer is exposed for ion
implan
