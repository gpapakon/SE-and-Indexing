<ABSTRACT>
Catalyst composed of the oxides of silicon, aluminium and titanium, characterised in that the catalyst particles are made up of a core of the composition (SiO2)x(AlO2)yMy where x/y = 10 -  INFINITY  and M = H, Na, K, NH4, NR4, where R = C1-C8-alkyl, and a shell of the composition (SiO2)n(TiO2)m where n/m = 12 - 1000 and both core and shell have a crystal structure of the type MFI or MEL. The catalyst can be produced by preparing in a known manner a synthesis gel for the preparation of a titanosilicalite, introducing into this synthesis gel an aluminosilicate of the structural type MFI or MEL and further processing the synthesis gel in a known manner.
