<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a process for the reductive dehalogenation of halogenated hydrocarbons contained in mixtures of solid or liquid substances by treating these substances with sodium in liquid ammonia. According to the invention, halogenated hydrocarbons can be destroyed in this manner rapidly and completely without preceding extraction even if they are present in the sorbed state on solid matrices, such as activated charcoal, ash, river sediments, soils and the like.

<CLAIMS>
A process for the reductive dehalogenation of hydrogen
halides present in mixtures with solids by treating

these mixtures with sodium in liquid ammonia, whereby
metallic sodium is added to a contaminated solid

dispersed in liquid ammonia and undergoes further
chemical reactions in a dissolved state.
A process according to claim 1 whereby the sodium
treatment lasts 1-30 minutes and preferably 2-10

minutes at 15-25 °C under pressure with reflux.
A process according to claim 1 whereby the sodium
treatment lasts 1-20 minutes and preferably 2-10

minutes below 0 °C without pressure or under a
slightly increased pressure.
A process according to claim 1 whereby the treatment
is carried out with excess sodium, and the unused

reagent is removed as an ammoniac solution for
additional reactions before it is decomposed with

hydrogen-active compounds.
A process according to claim 1 whereby the solvent,
ammonia, is evaporated after the reaction is over by

heating it and/or flash evaporation and recycled.
