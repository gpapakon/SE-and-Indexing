<ABSTRACT>
To achieve unitary (uniform) oxidic (oxidation) layers and defined surface properties, a process is provided for producing oxidic layers on metallic substrates subsequent to a nitridation (nitriding) or nitrocarburation process, in which the oxygen potential present in the oxidising atmosphere is continually determined, the measurement result is compared with a predetermined set value and, in the case of deviations, the oxidising atmosphere is modified until the measurement result agrees with the set value.

Process for producing uniform oxide layers on metallic workpieces following a
nitration or nitrocarburisation process, wherein the workpieces are exposed to

an oxidising atmosphere at given temperature for a preset time after nitration or
nitrocarburisation, characterised in that the oxygen potential existing in the

oxidising atmosphere is determined continuously, the measured result is
compared with a preset theoretical value and in the case of deviations the

oxidising atmosphere is modified until the measured result agrees with the
theoretical value, wherein the theoretical value is fixed so that the oxygen

potential at the given oxidising temperature always lies above the formation
limit of Fe
3
O

 oxide, but below the formation limit of other iron oxides.
Process according to claim 1, characterised in that the theoretical value for the
oxygen potential is set between 1,100 mV and 800 mV at temperatures

between 450°C and 650°C.
Process according to claim 1 or 2, characterised in that oxidising agent is

supplied when the theoretical value is not reached.

reducing agent is supplied when the theoretical value is exceeded.
Process according to one of the preceding claims, characterised in that the
supply of reducing agent is stopped when the theoretical value is not reached. 
Process according to one of the preceding claims, characterised in that when
the theoretical value is exceeded the oxidising agent is disconnected and the

reducing agent connected at the same time or alternately.
Process according to one of the preceding claims, characterised in that when
the theoretical value is not reached the oxidising agent is connected and the

reducing disconnected at the same time or alternately.
Process according to one of the preceding claims, characterised in that the
oxidising agent contains air H

Device for carrying out the process according to one of claims 1 to 10, wherein
the nitration or nitrocarburisation and the subsequent oxidisation is carried out

in an atmospheric furnace (1) which has at least one gas supply line (8),
characterised in that an oxygen probe (10) is arranged in the furnace chamber

(4) and in that a control device is connected to the oxygen probe and controls
the gas supply to the atmospheric furnace (1) as a function of the measured

value.
