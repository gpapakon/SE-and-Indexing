<ABSTRACT>
A shock absorbing device provided with a damping 
plate damper comprises a viscosity damper including: a 

case body consisting of an upper flange, a body portion and 
a lower flange; a resilient member provided with a collar, an 

outer surface of a body portion thereof and the undersurface 
of a collar portion thereof being connected to the 

above-described case body; a center shaft connected to the 
central portion of the resilient member provided with the 

collar; a damping plate fixed to the bottom end portion of 
the center shaft; and a viscous substance filled up in a damper 

case fixed to the bottom end of the above-described case 
body. An operator cabin of a construction machine is resiliently 

supported on a machine body through this shock absorbing 
device. For this reason, the number 
of natural vibration 
of the operator cabin during high speed running of a 

hydraulic power shovel is increased, whereby resonnance 
thereof with the mesh-up frequencies by a caterpillar band 

and a sprocket wheel is avoided, so that effective damping 
effects can be achieved against the number of vibrations applied 

in wide ranges by the construction machines and the 
like, thus improving riding comfort for an operator and the 

mechanical strength of the operator cabin.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to an operator cabin placed to 
construction machines such as a hydraulic power shovel, more 
particularly, to a resilient supporting device for resiliently 
supporting an operator cabin against a car body. Fig. 9 is a side view showing the appearance of a typical 
hydraulic power shovel applied to general use, including an 
operator cabin 1, an upper turning body 2, an upper turning 
body frame 2a and a lower traveling body 3. Fig. 10 is a longitudinal section showing the relation of 
placement between the operator cabin 1 and the upper turning 
body frame 2a, in which a floor plate 21a of the operator 
cabin 1 is fixed by a shock absorbing device 24 to a 
supporting frame 22b to which the upper turning body frame 2a 
is welded. Fig. 12 is a longitudinal section showing the detail of 
the related connection between the floor plate 21a and the 
supporting frame 22b fixed by the shock absorbing device 24. 
In Fig. 12, a resilient member 24a filled up in a case 24c,  
 
which is arranged between the floor plate 21a and the 
supporting frame 22b, and a resilient member 24b filled up in 
a case 24d sandwich the supporting frame 22b therebetween, a 
floor boss 21b welded on the floor plate 21a penetrates the 
case 24c, the resilient member 24a, the case 24d and the 
resilient member 24b, and then a bolt 26 is fastened to the 
floor boss 21b, so that a predetermined amount of space for 
tightening are given between the resilient members 24a and 24b 
and the floor plate 21a and the supporting frame 22b are 
assembled. Also, the floor plate 21a is fastened to a blacket 
21c welded on the frame of the operator cabin 1 by a bolt 27. In this manner, as shown in Fig. 11, four shock absorbing 
devices 24 are placed in both corners of the back and forth 
sides of the operator cabin 1, resilient members 25 are put 
between the periphery of the floor boss 21b and holes to which 
the supporting frames 22b are attached, so that the operator 
cabin 1 can be resiliently located in the horizontal surface 
against the upper turning body frame 2a. However, in the 
prior art mentioned above, since the floor plate 21a of the 
operator cabin 1 is connected to the supporting frame 22b of 
the upper turning body 2 by the four shock absorbing devices 
24, the number of natural vibrations of the operator cabin 1 
becomes small, whereby the number of natural vibrations of the 
operator cabin 1 during high speed running of a hydraulic 
power shovel becomes close to mesh-up frequencies provided by  
 
a
