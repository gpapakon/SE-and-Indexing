<DESCRIPTION>
N-T-BUTYL-ANDROST-3.5-DIENE-17β-CARBOXAMIDE-3-CARBOXYLTCACID POLYMORPH B The present invention relates to a novel polymorphic form of N-t-butyl-androst-3,5-diene-17β- carboxamide-3-carboxylic acid.Brief Description of the DrawingsFigure I is an Infa-red spectrum of N-t-butyl- androst-3,5-diene-17β-carboxylic acid polymorph B.Figure II is an enhanced FT-IR spectrum of the 3399-3501 cm-1 region of polymorph B disclosing the characteristic N-H stretch of polymorph B.Detailed Description of the Invention N-t-butyl-androst-3,5-diene-17β-carboxamide-3- carboxylic acid is a compound which is disclosed and claimed as being useful in the treatment of benign prostatic hypertrophy in U.S. Patent No. 5,017,568, the entire disclosure of which is hereby incorporated by reference. Said compound can be prepared by methods such as described in U.S. Patent No. 5,017,568. The isolation and identification of the polymorphic forms of said compound is advantageous in identifying desirable 

physical characteristics of the different crystal forms of said compound.It has now been found that a polymorphic form (hereinafter polymorph B) of the compound N-t-butyl- androst-3,5-diene-17β-carboxamide-3-carboxylic acid can be obtained in a high state of polymorphic purity by crystallization or by precipitation of said compound from or by the trituration of said compound in a solvent consisting of or primarily consisting of acetonitrile, 2-butanone, methanol or tetrahydrofuran. Also, contemplated herein is the process of obtaining substantially pure polymorph B by crystallization or by precipitation of said compound from or by the trituration of said compound in a solvent consisting of a combination of solvents selected form acetonitrile, 2- butanone, methanol and tetrahydrofuran. Preferably, crude N-t-butyl-androst-3,5-diene-17β-carboxamide-3- carboxylic acid is dissolved in and substantially pure polymorph B is crystalized from a solution of boiling acetonitrile, said solution optionally containing a co- solvent, preferably methylene chloride, to aid dissolution. Preferably a 12-40% by weight slurry of N- t-butyl-androst-3,5-diene-17β-carboxamide-3-carboxylic acid in acetonitrile is stirred at above ambient temperature. Preferably a 14-20% by weight slurry of N- t-butyl-androst-3,5-diene-17β-carboxamide-3-carboxylic acid in boiling acetonitrile is stirred, preferably for about an hour. Preferably, crude N-t-butyl-androst-3,5- diene-17β-carboxamide-3-carboxylic acid is dissolved in and substantially pure polymorph B is precipitated
