Saccharomyces.
Biomass according to one of the Claims 1 to 3, 
characterized by
 the fact that it

homofermentative and heterofermentative strains, and secondly a strain of yeast
belonging to the Saccharomyces genus that does not ferment maltose, such as the strain

Saccharomyces cerevisiae variety chevalieri.
Biomass according to one of the Claims 1 to 3, 
characterized by
 the fact that it
comprises a strain of bacteria belonging to the species Streptococcus faecium and a 

strain of yeast belonging to the species Saccharomyces cerevisiae, these strains having
been chosen with the intention of using the biomass as a probiotic in animal nutrition.
Biomass according to one of the Claims 1 to 3, 
characterized by
 the fact that it
comprises a strain of bacteria belonging either to the genus Lactobacillus or to the

species Leuconostoc oenos, chosen for its property of performing the malo-lactic
