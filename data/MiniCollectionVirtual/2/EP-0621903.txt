<ABSTRACT>
A method of reducing material containing metal oxide in a circulating fluidized bed, in which coal in excess and air is introduced into the fluidization chamber (12) so as to maintain a temperature of 
>
 850 DEG C in the chamber. Bed material which has been separated from the flue gases is conveyed through a carbidization chamber (48) in a recirculation system at a temperature of 
<
 850  DEG C to the lower part of the fluidization chamber. Conditions favourable for formation of carbide are maintained in the carbidization chamber.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method for reducing 
material containing metal oxide in solid phase in a 
circulating fluidized bed reactor. The present invention is particularly suited for reduction 
of iron ore to metallic iron with carbon, i.e. with a 
mixture of CO and CO₂. The invention can advantageously be 
used for pre-reducing iron ore before the smelting stage 
in a direct smelting reduction process. The reduction of iron oxide is an endothermic process and 
requires supply of energy. In a reduction process in which 
coal or coke in solid form is supplied, the energy required 
for the reaction can easily be supplied by partial 
combustion of the coal. Depending on the temperature, a 
certain content of CO₂ in the gas can be permitted, 
preferably however so that the CO₂/CO+CO₂ ratio does not 
exceed 0.2. This implies a certain degree of oxidation of 
the coal or the coke beyond the CO stage, but requires 
then preheating of the ore concentrate as well as the air, 
if air and not oxygen is used. The reaction kinetics of the reductionFe₂O₃ ---> FeO
 
is relatively unfavourable at the low temperatures normally 
prevaling in fluidized bed reactors. At temperatures of 
about 800°C, reaction times of several minutes, possibly 
tens of minutes, are required, depending on the particle 
size and the desired degree of reduction. The subsequent 
reaction according toFeO + CO ---> Fe + CO₂
 
to metallic iron is effected at a temperature of above 
700°C at an appropriate gas composition.  
 The reduction of iron ore to metallic iron in the fluidized 
bed is impeded by the tendency of the particles in the bed 
to sinter. Higher temperatures, which would give higher, 
and therefore more favourable, reaction kinetics for the 
reduction process, lead to a higher tendency to sinter. 
The risk of sintering has considerably limited the use of 
fluidized bed technique for pre-reduction of iron ore. Sintering is believed to be caused in part by the sticky 
iron ore particles in which the iron is completely or 
partly in metallic form. FeO appears as a molten layer on 
the surface of the pre-reduced ore, which causes sintering 
of small particles into larger particles and aggregates. 
Sintering of the particles in the reactor renders it 
difficult or impossible to bring about fluidization in the 
reactor. Sintering can, in addition to a molten iron layer on the 
particles, be caused by crystallization of metallic iron 
as dendrites on the ore particles, whereby particles are 
formed that very easily become
