<ABSTRACT>
An information processing apparatus has a 
plurality of nodes, a connection line for connection 

between the plurality of nodes, an arbiter for 
performing arbitration of use of the connection line, 

and an arbitration signal line for connection between 
the arbiter and each node, wherein the arbiter performs 

processing of a request for use of the connection line 
and processing of additional information related to 

data transfer executed after connection of the 
connection line. An arbitration method in the 

information processing apparatus includes steps of 
letting a node originating a request for use of the 

connection line, when requesting use of the connection 
line to the arbiter, also send additional information 

related to data transfer on the connection line 
together with the request for use to the arbiter; and 

letting the arbiter, when performing arbitration of use 
of the connection line to set the connection line based 

on the request, send the additional information related 
to the data transfer to a node being to receive the 

request.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates principally to an
information processing apparatus consisting of a
plurality of nodes, each having at least a processor
and a memory, and a connection line for connecting the
nodes.For connecting a plurality of information
processing apparatus (each of which will be called as a
node in the present application), each of which has at
least one processor and one memory for the purpose of
data exchange between nodes, there are a method to
connect them using one of various types of LANs and a
method to connect them at address level of memory
without using a LAN.In these cases, an arbiter is generally
provided for avoiding a conflict of access to a
connection line between nodes and performing
arbitration of a right of use of the connection line.
Receiving connection line setting information from the
arbiter, two nodes set up a connection line based on
the information and exchange address information and 
the like through the set line, thereafter performing
actual data transmission. Fig. 1 shows an example of
the system for performing such an operation and Fig. 2
shows a timing chart to show a flow of the processing
in that case.In Fig. 1, reference numerals 100, 200, and 300
designate nodes, which are connected by a connection
line 10. Each node includes a CPU 101, 201, 301, a
memory 102, 202, 302, an interface circuit 103, 203,
303 for connection between the connection line 10 and
the inside of each node, an arbitration interface
circuit 104, 204, 304 used in requesting use of the
connection line 10, and an internal bus 105, 205, 305
for interconnection between the listed internal
components in node. Numeral 20 denotes an arbiter for
performing arbitration of use of the connection line
10. The arbiter 20 is connected with each node by an
arbitration signal line 110, 210, 310. Inside the
arbiter there is a line selection information managing
apparatus 21 for managing line request information sent
from each node.Fig. 2 shows an example where CPU 101 on node
100 reads data in memory 202 on node 200. In the
timing chart as shown in Fig. 2, the horizontal axis
represents lapse of time, an arrow a flow of signal and
control, a rectangle a process executed in each
processing apparatus, and a hexagon a state in which a 
variety of information is present for transmission on
the internal bus, the connection line, or the
arbitration signal line. Phases in the processing will
be described one by one.CPU 101 on node 100 issues an address on the
common bus 105. Detecting it, the arbiter
