<ABSTRACT>
A detergent composition comprises (a) one or more glyceryl ethers of a C12-C18 alkyl or alkenyl primary or secondary alcohol, at least 50 mole percent of the glyceryl ether being diglyceryl ether and not more than 25 mole percent of the glyceryl being monoglyceryl ether, and (b) an anionic detersive surfactant. The compositions, which may be in granular or liquid form, may also contain other conventional ingredients, e.g. other detersive surfactants, detergency building compounds, enzymes and bleaches.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to detergent compositions,
especially heavy duty compositions, that contain one or
more glyceryl ethers as a nonionic detersive surfactant.Heavy duty detergents, whether in granular or liquid form,
commonly comprise an anionic detersive surfactant, for
example sodium (linear alkyl) benzene sulfonate in which
the alkyl group preferably has 11-13 carbon atoms, or
sodium alkyl sulfate, e.g that obtained by sulfating a C8-C18
alkanol. To improve the performance of such detergent
compositions against greasy stains and soils, it is
conventional to include a nonionic detersive surfactant,
typically a condensation product of a (C6-C15 alkyl) phenol
or a C8-C22 alkanol with ethylene oxide. Preferred
condensates are those containing 3-12 moles of ethylene
oxide per mole of alkylphenol or 4-8 moles of ethylene
oxide per mole of alkanol. A particular preferred nonionic
is a condensate of C14-C15 alkanol with 7 moles of ethylene
oxide per mole of alkanol.The ethylene oxide used in the preparation of the above
discussed nonionics is, however, derived from oil and,
furthermore, is a reagent that needs careful handling in
order to minimise the risk of explosion. Thus, on account
both of economics and of safety and other environmental
considerations, it would be desirable to find an
alternative nonionic surfactant.The present invention relates to the use as a nonionic
detersive surfactant in a detergent composition of one or
more glyceryl ethers of the general formula
RO - (C3-H6-O2)nH 
wherein
R represents an alkyl or alkenyl group of from 12 to
18 carbon atoms,C3H6O2 represents a divalent radical formed by removal
from glycerol of an hydroxyl group and of the hydrogen
from another hydroxyl group, andn is an integer,
in particular glyceryl ethers of which 50-100 mole percent
is constituted by diglyceryl ether ( n = 2 ) and 0-25 mole
percent is constituted by monoglyceryl ether ( n = 1 ), the
remainder, if any, being constituted by triglyceryl ethers
( n = 3 ) and/or higher homologues (n>3).In one aspect, the present invention provides a detergent
composition comprising (a) one or more glyceryl ethers of
the general formula (1) as defined above and (b) an anionic
detersive surfactant.The glyceryl ethers of the general formula (1) defined
above are effective as nonionic detersive surfactants. At
least 50 mole percent and preferably at least 60 mole
percent of the glyceryl ethers of the formula (1) present
in the detergent composition of this invention should be
constituted by diglyceryl
