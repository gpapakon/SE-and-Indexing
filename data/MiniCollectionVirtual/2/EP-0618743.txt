<ABSTRACT>
Improved time-division multiplexed 
communication methods for a wide area paging system. 

One method appends check bits of a correction code to 
each data word and interleaves the words on 

transmission. A second method transmits multiple 
messages for one or more paging receivers in a single 

time slot. A third method increases the number of 
individual receivers that can be served by a single 

paging system. A fourth method increases the number of 
receivers that can be served by splitting the receivers 

in an area among several systems.

<DESCRIPTION>
THIS INVENTION relates to communication systems and receivers and more
particularly to a method and system for data transmission to many receivers on
a common channel.International Publication No. WO86/03645 discloses a watch pager and
communication protocol in a transmitter system comprising a plurality of
stations transmitting, on different frequencies, digital data packets to a plurality
of receivers each having an address-system control infonnation encoded into
control packets which are transmitted to the receivers to direct a receiver to a
system and a channel for receiving following data packets. To this aim, the receiver must scan
the frequency spectrum for control packets and check their contents, in order to verify if the system to which it is currently
tuned is its assigned system; these operations are repeated until the verification yields a positive result.With respect to this known system, the present invention aims at simplifying the tuning of a receiver to its
assigned transmitting station, and at increasing the number of individual receivers that can be served by a
single transmitter system. In this respect:One object of the invention is to service a large number of users.A further object of the invention is to enable paging via a common
system of a virtually unlimited number of pager subscribers within any desired
area, including local, regional, national, continental, and worldwide
communication capability.Still another object of the invention is to enable subscribers in such
paging system reliably and efficiently to receive messages of unlimited length
and information content.Accordingly, one aspect of the present invention provides a time
division multiplexed communication method for increasing the number of
individual receivers that can be served by a single transmitter system
comprising a plurality of stations 
transmitting on different frequencies digital data packets to a plurality of
receivers each having an address, the method being characterised by:
encoding format information in a data packet uniquely addressed to a
receiver within the system indicating that the data therein is receiver control
information rather than message information;encoding in the receiver control information the identification of stations
within the system to which the addressed receiver must tune for message
information;transmitting the data packet from all stations within the system to alert
the addressed receiver to tune to any of the identified stations; andtransmitting the data packets having

<CLAIMS>
A time division multiplexed communication method for increasing the
number of individual receivers that can be served by a single transmitter

system comprising a
plurality of stations transmitting on different frequencies digital data packets to

a plurality of receivers each having an address, the method being characterised
by: encoding format information in a data packet uniquely addressed to a

receiver within the system indicating that the data therein is receiver control
information rather than message information; encoding in the receiver control

information the identification of stations within the system to which the
addressed receiver must tune for message information; transmitting the data

packet from all stations within the system to alert the addressed receiver to tune
to any of the identified stations; and transmitting the data packets having

message information to the addressed receiver only from the identified stations.
The method of Claim 1 in which encoding the identification of stations
comprises identifying each station by a time offset that corresponds to the

station's frequency in a list of frequencies and offsets known to the receiver.
A time division multiplexed communication systems for increasing the
number of individual receivers that can be served by a single transmitter system

comprising a plurality of stations transmitting on
different frequencies digital data packets to a plurality of receivers each having

an address, the communication system being characterised by: means for encoding format
information in a data packet uniquely addressed to a receiver within the

transmitter system indicating that the data therein is receiver control
information rather than message information; means for encoding in the

receiver control information the identification of stations within the transmitter 
system to which the addressed receiver must tune for message information;

means for transmitting the data packet from all stations within the system to
alert the addressed receiver to tune to any of the identified stations; and means

for transmitting from the identified stations to the addressed receiver the data
packets having message information.
The communication system of Claim 3 in which the means for encoding the
identification of stations comprises means for identifying each station by a time

offset that corresponds to the station's frequency in a list of frequencies and
offsets known to the receiver.
