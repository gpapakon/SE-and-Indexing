<ABSTRACT>
The present invention relates to a gel composition comprising a pigment
and/or filler which has been surface-treated by a water-repellent oil-repellent agent,

and a gelling agent comprising a polyacrylamide-based polymer. The invention
also relates to a cosmetic composition composed of or comprising the gel

composition, and an external agent for skin composed of or comprising the gel
composition. The compositions according to the invention excel in pigment and/or

filler uniformity and stability and have a good outer appearance even when
containing a relatively large amount of pigments.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a gel composition with a novel texture, and
particularly relates to a gel composition containing a relatively high amount of a
pigment and/or filler, suitable for use in cosmetic compositions or external agents for
the skin. Additionally, the invention relates to a cosmetic composition such as a
makeup, sun care or skin care composition or an external agent for the skin
formulated by using this gel composition.While various agent formats have been used conventionally in the field of
cosmetics, cream or lotion type formats lack a feeling of refreshment and tend to be
sticky, and therefore are not suited to regions or seasons with high-temperature,
high-humidity climates, such as the summers in Japan, and gel compositions which
are generally known as gels are widely used as agent formats which have an
abundant sense of refreshment.However, although it is often desirable to add a relatively large amount of
pigments and/or fillers depending on the type of cosmetic composition, if pigments
and/or fillers are included in large amounts in a gel base, the pigments and/or fillers
cannot be uniformly dispersed in the gel base due to problems in the compatibility,
so that the appearance of the gel becomes non-uniform in the manner of the surface
pattern of marble.Additionally, while water-soluble polymers having gelling ability are used
for the formulation of gels, the particle supporting net-work structure formed by the
polymers become unstable after the passage of a few days to a few weeks due to an 
ionization effect, and the quality of the gel product is degraded overall.Furthermore, while gum-based gels using xanthan gum as the water-soluble
polymer are known, these gels tend to be sticky, and do not have a sufficient sense of
refreshment.Moreover, conventional gel compositions also have a problem in that they
have less fitness to skin and are less easily applied in comparison to other formats.Therefore, the discovery of a gel composition with exceptional pigment
and/or filler dispersibility and stability, having a good appearance, providing-a sense
of coolness and a sense of refreshment without stickiness, and with exceptional
fitness to skin and applicability in comparison to conventional gel compositions has
been desired.Upon performing diligent research in view of the above situation, the present
inventors discovered unexpectedly that it is possible to obtain an excellent gel
composition which does not have the above-described problems by surface-treating
the pigment
