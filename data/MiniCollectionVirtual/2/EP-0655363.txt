<ABSTRACT>
A traction power converter for a rail vehicle is proposed, having at least two four-quadrant converters (4q-S1, 4q-S2), at least two power inverters (WR1, WR2), at least two intermediate circuit capacitors (Cd1, Cd2) and at least one series resonant circuit comprising a series resonant capacitor (CSK) and a series resonant inductor (LSK). Switches (28 to 34) are provided which permit all the components (4q-S1, 4q-S2, WR1, WR2, Cd1, Cd2, CSK/LSK) to be connected to form a system with an entire intermediate circuit, the first four-quadrant converter (4q-S1), the first power inverter (WR1), the first intermediate circuit capacitor (Cd1) and the series resonant circuit (CSK/LSK) to be connected to form a first subsystem with intermediate subcircuit, and the second four-quadrant converter (4q-S2), the second power inverter (WR2), the second intermediate circuit capacitor (Cd2) and the series resonant circuit (CSK/LSK) to be connected to form a second subsystem with intermediate subcircuit.

Traction power converter for a railway vehicle, 
having at least two four-quadrant converters (4q-S1, 

4q-S2), at least two invertors (WR1, WR2), at least two 
intermediate-circuit capacitors (Cd1, Cd2) and at least 

one series tuned circuit, which comprises a series tuned 
circuit capacitor (CSK) and a series tuned circuit 

inductor (LSK), switches (28 to 34, 39) being provided 
which enable connection of all the components (4q-S1, 

4q-S2, WR1, WR2, Cd1, Cd2, CSK/LSK) first to form a 
system with an overall intermediate circuit, connection 

of the first four-quadrant converter (4q-S1), of the 
first invertor (WR1), of the first intermediate-circuit 

capacitor (Cd1) and of the series tuned circuit (CSK/LSK) 
to form a first partial system with a partial intermediate 

circuit, as well as connection of the second 
four-quadrant converter (4q-S2), of the second invertor 

(WR2), of the second intermediate-circuit capacitor (Cd2) 
and of the series tuned circuit (CSK/LSK) to form a 

second partial system with a partial intermediate circuit, 
characterized in that the series tuned circuit 

(CSK, LSK) can be connected via in each case one switch 
(31 to 34) to each pole of the two partial intermediate 

circuits. 
Traction power converter according to Claim 1, 
characterized in that a third four-quadrant converter 

(4q-S3) is provided whose functionally associated 
converter phases (4q-S3.1,4q-S3.2) are distributed in 

terms of circuitry between different partial systems. 
Traction power converter according to Claim 1,  
 

characterized in that both the first partial system and 
the second partial system are assigned a further, additional 

four-quadrant converter (4q-S3,4q-S4). 
Traction power converter according to one of 
Claims 1 to 3, characterized in that two identical 

converter systems are provided, which each comprise two 
partial systems.
