<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a power converting 
apparatus for converting dc power to AC power or inverting 
AC power to dc power, and more particularly concerns 
controlling a voltage across a capacitor on a dc side of 
the power converting apparatus to control an AC voltage of 
three levels. A usual three-level power converter operates in the 
way that capacitors connected in series divides a DC 
voltage to two DC voltages to create three level voltages, 
including a high, intermediate, and low potentials, and 
switching devices of a main circuit are turned on or off 
to selectively lead the three level powers to an AC side 
of the power converter. A control method of an AC output voltage in which 
the power converter is used as an inverter for converting 
the DC to AC was proposed in "A Novel Approach to the 
Generation and Optimization of Three-Level PWM Waveforms," 
PESC '88 Record, April, 1988, pp. 1255-1262 (hereinafter 
referred to as the document 1). The document 1 proposes a dipoler modulation method 
in which a positive and negative pulse voltages are  
 
alternately fed out via zero voltage as a modulation 
method useful for waveform improvement and minute voltage 
control of the three-level inverter. However, the three-level power converter is involved 
in such a problem that voltages of the capacitors for 
dividing the DC voltage to two (hereinafter referred to as 
the voltage dividing capacitors) are made imbalance. The imbalance is due to unequal voltage sharing of 
the voltage dividing capacitors. The unequal voltage 
sharing is caused by a DC current component flowing into a 
serial connection (hereinafter referred to as the neutral 
point) of the voltage dividing capacitors. Such an 
undesirable flowing is due to difference of capacitances 
of the voltage dividing capacitors, dispersion of AC 
voltages of the power converter (imbalance of the positive 
and negative pulses), or distortion of the output current 
(imbalance of positive and negative current waveforms 
likely caused by superimposition of higher harmonics). A technique for limiting the voltage imbalance of 
the voltage dividing capacitors was disclosed in the 
Japanese Patent Laid-Open No.2-101969(1995), "Balance 
Control of DC Input Capacitors of NPC Inverter," 
Semiconductor Power Study Group, Association of Electric 
Engineers, SPC-91-37, June, 1991, pp. 111-120 (hereinafter 
referred to as the document 2).  The limiting technique for the voltage imbalance of 
the two DC components disclosed in the Japanese Patent
