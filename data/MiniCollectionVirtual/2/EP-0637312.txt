<ABSTRACT>
The invention concerns a method of preparing alkyl glycosides by reacting reducing saccharides with dialkyl sulphates in which the alkyl groups have at least two C-atoms, the molar ratio of saccharides to dialkyl sulphates being 1:1 to 1:5. The invention also concerns the use of the reaction mixtures, which contain as their major components alkyl monoglycosides and alcohol sulphates, as surfactants, preferably in washing and cleaning agents.

<CLAIMS>
A process for preparing alkylglycosides by 
alkylation of reducing saccharides in the presence of a 

base and a solvent, characterized in that the alkylating 
agent used is a dialkyl sulfate whose alkyl groups 

contain at least 6 carbon atoms, the molar ratio of 
saccharide to dialkyl sulfate being from 1:1 to 1:5. 
A process as claimed in claim 1, wherein the 
alkyl groups of the dialkyl sulfate contain 6 to 30 

carbon atoms and may contain a double bond. 
A process as claimed in claim 1 or 2, wherein the 
base used is a hydroxide, amide, hydride, oxide or 

carbonate of an alkali metal and/or alkaline earth metal, 
boron hydride, sodium borohyride or an hydride, 

hydroxide, oxide or carbonate of aluminum. 
A process as claimed in claim 1 or 2 or 3, 
wherein the molar ratio of the base to the saccharide 

units is 1:1 to 10:1.
