<ABSTRACT>
Moving platform intended to reproduce periodical movements along three axes (longitudinal, transverse, vertical) with a preferential direction (XX), the said platform (2) being carried via a baseplate (1) on the one hand, at one end (termed "rear") by means of at least one leg (3) coupled to a crank (7) and, on the other hand, at the other end (termed "front") by link rods articulated to the said baseplate, characterised in that the said crank (7) is carried by a support (9) connected to the baseplate (1) by a leg (9a) which can be moved laterally such that the crank (7) finds itself either in a vertical plane comprising the preferential direction (XX), or in a plane which is oblique to one side or the other, and in that the two front legs are each articulated onto a link rod (15, 20) which is substantially vertical, each link rod (15, 20) being articulated directly or indirectly at its lower end to the baseplate (1).

A moveable platform intended to reproduce periodic 
movements along three axes (longitudinal, transverse, vertical) with one 

preferential direction (XX), the platform (2) being carried by a base (1) on 
the one hand, at one end (so-called 'rear') by means of at least one foot 

(3) coupled to a crank (7) and on the other hand, at the other end (so-called 
'front') by rods pivoted on the base, characterised by the fact that 

the crank (7) is carried by a support (9) connected to the base (1) by a 
foot (9a) which can be displaced laterally in a manner such that the 

crank (7) is disposed either in a vertical plane including the preferential 
direction (XX), or in an oblique plane at one side or the other, and in 

that the two front feet are articulated each on a substantially vertical rod 
(15, 20), each rod (15, 20) being articulated directly or indirectly at its 

lower end on the base (1). 
A platform according to Claim 1, in which the articulation on 
the base (1) of one of the two front rods (20) is constituted by a 

horizontal shaft (21) substantially perpendicular to the preferential 
direction. 
A platform according to Claim 1 or Claim 2, in which the 
position of one of the front feet (5) with respect to the platform (2) can 

be modified at will along a line (24) substantially parallel to the 
preferential direction (XX). 
A platform according to Claim 1, in which the platform (2) is 
provided with a receptacle (25).  

 
A platform according to Claim 4, in which the position of the 
receptacle (25) can be modified at will (fâ‚ƒ) along the preferential 

direction (XX). 
A platform according to Claim 1, in which the rear foot (3) is 
single. 
A platform according to Claim 1, in which the rear foot (3) is 
double in order to increase the rigidity of the assembly. 
A platform according to Claim 1, in which the crank (7) is an 
arm of variable length. 
A platform according to Claim 1, in which the crank (7) is a 
disc. 
A platform according to Claim 9, in which the disc constituting 
the crank (7) is provided with a window (26), positioned in an 

asymmetrical manner, in which the connection between the rear foot (3) 
and the crank (7) can move according to the direction of rotation of the 

crank. 
A platform according to Claim 1, in which the crank (7) is 
driven in rotation by a variable speed motor (14) of which the direction 

may be reversed. 
A platform according to Claim 11, in which the rotation of the 
motor (14) is controlled by means permitting the number of revolutions 

per minute to be varied.  
 
A platform according to Claim 12, in which these control means 
permit the cyclical variation of the rotational speed during each 

revolution. 
A platform according to Claim 1, in which the front feet (4, 5) 
are indirectly articulated on the base by being carried by a shaft (30) 

rotatable in two bearings (31), the shaft being elbowed in order that the 
lower ends of the rods are driven in a movement of amplitude R, so as 

to induce pitching movements of the platform. 
A platform according to Claim 14, in which the shaft (30) has a 
first portion (35) carrying a rod (20) describing a cylinder of first radius 

and a second portion (34) carrying a rod (15) describing a cylinder of 
second radius different from the first, so as to induce rolling movements 

in the platform at the same time as the pitching movements. 
A platform according to Claim 1, in which the rear foot (3) is 
articulated on the platform (2) by means of a swivel joint (35) and a 

second crank (37) drives a rod (36) disposed between this crank (37) and 
the swivel joint (19) connecting the front foot (5) to the rod (20) 

articulated on the base, so as to induce oscillating movements in the rod 
(20) articulated on the base.
