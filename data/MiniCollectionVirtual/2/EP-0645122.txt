Syringe for the controlled discharge of paste-like materials having a cartridge 
(2) for holding the materials into which a rotary piston (4) plunges from the one 

end thereof, whith the rotary piston with its one plunging end abutting against a 
stopper (6) having a disc-shaped partial surface which sealingly closes the 

inside cross section of the cartridge, characterized in that the disc-shaped 
partial surface of the stopper (6) is configured at least partly as a membrane 

surface (10) which, in a depressurized state, is prestressed assuming a stable 
position with respect to the plunging direction of the rotary piston (4) so that 

after a displacement by the rotary piston (4), the disc-shaped partial surface 
returns reversibly to the stable position in the depressurized state and in that 

the membrane surface (10) is formed from plastic material. 
Syringe as claimed in claim 1, characterized in that the stopper (6) is 
cup-shaped and has a base surface configured as an elastically deformable 

membrane surface (10). 
Syringe as claimed in one of claims 1 or 2, characterized in that the membrane 
surface (10) is prestressed in the form of a curvature opposite to the plunging 

direction of the rotary piston (4). 
Syringe as claimed in one of claims 1 to 3, characterized in that the stopper (6) 
comprises a sealing lip (15) on its outside portion in the region of contact with 

an inside wall of the cartridge (2).  
 
Syringe as claimed in claim 4, characterized in that the sealing lip (15) is 
configured in an encircling manner, projecting downward beyond the 

membrane surface (10) and outward beyond the side wall (11). 
Syringe as claimed in one of claims 2 to 5, characterized in that on an inside of 
the cup-shaped stopper (6), in a transitional region between a side wall (11) of 

the cup and the membrane surface (10), there is formed an at least partly 
encircling groove (13). 
Syringe as claimed in claim 5 and claim 6, characterized in that the encircling 
sealing lip (15), which is in contact under tension against the inside wall of the 

cartridge (2), exerts a moment on the membrane surface (10) which is directed 
opposite to the plunging direction of the rotary piston (4). 
Syringe as claimed in one of claims 2 to 7, characterized in that the wall (11) on 
an outside of the cup-shaped stopper (6) comprises radially-encircling 

channels and grooves and/or projections (14). 
Syringe as claimed in one of claims 2 to 8, characterized in that the diameter of 
the side walls (11) of the stopper (6) increases toward their free ends. 
Syringe as claimed in one of the claims 1 to 8, characterized in that the end 
(22) of the rotary piston (4) is curved. 
Syringe as claimed in claim 10, characterized in that the curvature of the end 
(22) of the rotary piston (4) is configured according to the maximum travel of 

the membrane surface (10) of the stopper (6) in a direction of forward motion of 
the rotary piston (4). 
Syringe as claimed in one of claims 1 to 11, characterized in that the cartridge 
(2) forms a tight seal toward the material on the one side. 
Syringe as claimed in one of claims 1 to 12, characterized in that the stopper 
(6) on the plunging end of the rotary piston (4) abuts against a stop (14) formed 

on the cartridge (2).  
 
Syringe as claimed in one of claims 1 to 13, characterized in that the 
membrane surface (10) has a thickness between 0.2 and 0.6 mm. 
Syringe as claimed in claim 5, characterized in that the encircling sealing lip 
(15) projects outward by a distance in the range of 0.2 to 0.7 mm beyond the 

side walls (11). 
Syringe as claimed in claim 5, characterized in that the encircling sealing lip 
(15) projects downward by a distance in the range of 0.3 to 0.5 mm beyond the 

membrane surface (10). 
Syringe as claimed in claim 6, characterized in that the encircling groove (13) 
has a radius of about 0,5 mm.
