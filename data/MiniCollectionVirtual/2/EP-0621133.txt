<ABSTRACT>
A printing machine, in particular an offset machine, having a plurality of interacting cylinders (D1-D4) for printing, which are mounted so as to be rotatable, so as to be adjustable in terms of register and so as to be engageable with one another, in that the cylinders (D1-D4) are connected in each case to an electric motor (F, G) to form a direct drive. The rotor (F) of the electric motor (F, G) is firmly connected to the drive shaft (E) of the cylinder (D1-D4) and is mounted rotatably (21, 22) with said drive shaft in the wall (H) in an eccentric (A). The stator (G) is firmly connected to the wall (H) via a bridge-like projection (K). If the size of the air gap (L) is insufficient to take up the adjusting movement of the cylinder/rotor (F), an eccentric (B) can be arranged between the bridge-like projection (K) and the stator (G), which eccentric can be retained by means of blocking elements (C) and with which the stator (G) can also be adjusted to the adjusting movement of the cylinder/rotor (F).
