<ABSTRACT>
A sealing strip (9) has an essentially S-shaped cross section. The lateral boundary surfaces (12,13) of the recess (10) are in contact with one-piece spacers (14,15) under elastic stress. The spacers are so formed and arranged that the total surface of the flanks (17,18) of the sealing strip and the adjacent chambers (6,7) are jointly subject to the impact of pressure. The two flanks are provided with hollow sections (19,20) to create the S-shaped profile.

A sealing arrangement for sealing off two machine 
parts which are arranged so as to be pivotable relative 

to one another and are formed by a shaft and a housing 
which surrounds the shaft with radial spacing, the 

annular space formed by the spacing being subdivided by 
at least two wings into at least two chambers which are 

adjacent in the circumferential direction, are sealed off 
against one another, and can be pressurized alternately 

to introduce the pivoting movement, the wings being 
relatively rigidly connected to the shaft and/or the 

housing, extending substantially along the entire axial 
extent of the chambers, and respectively approaching the 

relatively movable machine part whilst leaving a sealing 
gap, respectively comprising a sealing strip of 

elastomeric material, which sealing strip is arranged in 
a substantially U-shaped groove of the wings, the said 

groove being open in the direction of the sealing gap, 
surrounds the wings on the circumferential side and, with 

a sealing surface, touches the relatively pivotable 
machine part in a sealing manner under elastic prestress, 

characterized in that the sealing strip (9) has a 
substantially S-shaped cross-section and touches the 

lateral boundary surfaces (12, 13) of the groove (10), 
bearing against them with integrally moulded-on spacers 

(14, 15) under elastic prestress and touches the groove 
base (16) in a sealing manner, and in that the spacers 

(14, 15) are designed and arranged in such a way that 
substantially the entire surface of the respective flanks 

(17, 18) of the sealing strip (9) and the respectively 
adjacent chambers (6, 7) can be pressurized together.  

 
A sealing arrangement according to claim 1, 
characterized in that the sealing strip (9) has a corresponding 

cross-section along its entire extent. 
A sealing arrangement according to either of 
claims 1 and 2, characterized in that the two flanks (17, 

18) of the sealing strip (9) are provided with correspondingly 
designed recesses (19, 20) to form the S-shaped 

profile. 
A sealing arrangement according to claim 3, 
characterized in that the recesses (19, 20) have a 

profile which is open substantially in a U-shape in the 
direction of the lateral boundary surfaces (12, 13) of 

the groove (10). 
A sealing arrangement according to either of 
claims 3 and 4, characterized in that the recesses (19, 

20) are respectively 0.3 to 0.6 times as wide as the 
width (21) of the sealing strip (9). 
A sealing arrangement according to any of claims 
3 to 5, characterized in that the recesses (19, 20) are 

respectively 0.1 to 0.4 times as high as the height (22) 
of the sealing strip (9). 
A sealing arrangement according to either of 
claims 5 and 6, characterized in that the ratio of the 

maximum width (21) and the maximum height (22) of the 
recesses (19, 20) is from 0.8 to 1.2. 
A sealing arrangement according to any of claims 
1 to 7, characterized in that the sealing strip (9) 

touches the groove base (16) of the groove (10) in a 
sealing manner with at least two statically stressed 

sealing surfaces (23, 24) under elastic prestress, and in 
that the statically stressed sealing surfaces (23, 24) 

are arranged adjacent to one another with spacing in the 
direction of the width (21) of the sealing strip (9). 
A sealing arrangement according to any of claims 
1 to 8, characterized by the use for sealing off a 

pivoting motor.
