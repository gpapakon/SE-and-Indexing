<ABSTRACT>
The invention discloses an extensible structural support having an inner tube (11) which is plugged telescopically into an outer tube (10) and is provided in the longitudinal direction with a plurality of bores (12.1, 12.2) for receiving a plug-in bolt (23) which is intended for the length adjustment of the structural support and, in the event of loading of the structural support, is supported on the outer tube (10). According to the invention, adjacent bores (12.1, 12.2) of the inner tube (11) are arranged such that they are offset, in the circumferential direction of said inner tube, by a predetermined angular amount in each case. By virtue of the bores (12.1, 12.2) being arranged such that they are offset at certain angles, the invention makes it possible, for a structural support with a predetermined nominal load-bearing capacity and with a spacing between adjacent bores (12.1, 12.2) of the inner tube (11) which is the same as in the prior art, to reduce the wall thickness and/or the diameter of the inner tube (11) considerably, as a result of which savings in materials and thus weight can be made for the structural support, this having considerable advantages in terms of costs, in particular as far as the mass production of such structural supports is concerned.
