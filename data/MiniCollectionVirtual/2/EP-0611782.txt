<ABSTRACT>
Antimicrobial quaternary ammonium group-containing organosilicon polymers, aqueous 
disinfectant solutions containing such polymers, and lenses p
roduced from such polymers 
are provided herein. The polymers are produced by homopolymerizing or copolymerizing, 

with a suitable comonomer, a quaternary ammonium group-containing organosilicon 
monomer of formula I as defined herein. A preferred monomer of formula I is the 

monomer of formula II: 

3-methacryloxypropyltetramethyldisiloxanylpropyldimethyloctadecylammonium chloride 
(MADAC).

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to quaternary ammonium group-containing organosilicon polymers 
and novel monomers used to produce these polymers. The invention also relates to 
methods of producing such polymers and monomers. The polymers may be used in wide 
applications as antimicrobial agents as, for example, in solutions to disinfect contact 
lenses and certain of these polymers may be used to produce solid structures, such as 
contact lenses. Contact lenses are typically made of hydrophilic and partially hydrophilic plastic 
materials. These materials have a high capacity to absorb water and swell to a soft mass or 
hydrogel. This hydrogel is characterized by excellent mechanical properties, complete 
transparency, good shape retention and high resistance to degradation in boiling water. 
Such hydrophilic or partially hydrophilic plastic materials are described in such patents as 
US-A-2,976,576, US-A-3,499,862 and US-A-3,503,942. These patents disclose, inter alia, 
the production of the so-called soft contact lenses. One of the problems associated with cleaning soft contact lenses made from the 
aforementioned hydrophilic materials, is in the disinfecting and cleaning of such lenses. 
These lenses have a high capacity to absorb water, i.e. upwards of about 38 weight % 
water, based on the total weight of the hydrogel. Therefore, the compounds employed to 
disinfect the contact lenses are often absorbed and possibly even concentrated in the lenses 
and later released when the soft contact lenses are worn on the eye. This, of course, may 
damage or stain the contact lenses and harm the sensitive tissues of the eye. Such 
preservative or disinfectant materials typically used to disinfect the contact lenses may be 
such materials as chlorohexidine or thimerosal, for example. To overcome these problems, materials such as quaternary ammonium group-containing 
polymers having antimicrobial activity may be used to disinfect the lenses. The advantage 
of using antimicrobial polymers is that they have a larger molecular size and are less 
likely to penetrate or be absorbed into the soft contact lenses, and tend to be less toxic.  
 Examples of such polmyers are the polymeric quaternary ammonium compounds having 
recurring vinyl benzene ammonium units. Such polymers are disclosed in 
US-A-4,482,680. These polymers have a disadvantage in that they have relatively poor 
solubility in water. Another example of polymers employed for disinfecting contact lenses are the organosilicon 
quaternary ammonium compounds
