<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a recording
liquid. More particularly, it relates to a recording liquid
suitable for ink-jet recording.The so-called ink-jet recording method has come
into practical use in which droplets of a recording liquid
containing a water-soluble colorant, e.g., a direct dye or an
acid dye, are issued from a minute ejection orifice and
adhered onto a receiving material, e.g., paper, to conduct
recording.The recording liquid is required not only to be
stably ejectable over a long time period and to rapidly fix
to recording papers for general business use, e.g., paper for
PPCs (plain-paper copiers), e.g., electrophotographic paper,
and fanfold paper (continuous paper for computers, etc.), to
give a print in which the printed characters are of good
quality, that is, the printed characters are free of blurring
and have clear contours, but also to be excellent in the
shelf stability. Therefore, solvents
usable in the recording liquid are severely restricted.The colorants for the recording liquid are
required, for example, not only to have sufficient solubility
in the solvents that are restricted as described above to 
thereby enable the recording liquid to be stable even in
long-term storage, but also to give printed images having
high density and excellent water resistance and light
resistance. However, it has been difficult to satisfy these
many requirements simultaneously.Although various techniques (e.g., JP-A-55-144067,
JP-A-57-30773, JP-A-57-207660, JP-A-58-147470,
JP-A-62-190269, JP-A-62-190271, JP-A-62-190272,
JP-A-62-250082, JP-A-62-246975, JP-A-62-257971,
JP-A-62-288659, JP-A-63-8463, JP-A-63-22867, JP-A-63-22874,
JP-A-63-30567, JP-A-63-33484, JP-A-63-63764, JP-A-63-105079,
JP-A-64-31877, JP-A-1-93389, JP-A-1-210464, JP-A-2-140270,
JP-A-3-167270, JP-A-3-200882, etc.) have hence been proposed,
a colorant has not been developed which sufficiently meets
the performance requirements of the market and is easy to
produce. (The term "JP-A" used herein means an "unexamined
published Japanese patent application.)An object of the present invention is to provide a
black recording liquid which is good in print quality when
used in ink-jet recording, writing, etc. to conduct recording
on plain paper; which gives recorded images having high
density and excellent in light resistance and, in particular,
in water resistance and recorded-image color tone; and which
has good stability in long-term storage. The recording
liquid exhibits good performance to give recorded images 
having high
