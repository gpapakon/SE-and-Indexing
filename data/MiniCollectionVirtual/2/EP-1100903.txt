<ABSTRACT>
A novel gene, PB39, that is up-regulated, or over-expressed, in prostate cancer has been identified. The gene has been identified by means of its cDNA obtained by reverse transcription of the corresponding mRNA. Microdissection of prostate glands that had been surgically removed from prostate cancer patients revealed a novel up-regulated transcript in an aggressive prostate carcinoma. Differential analysis for the presence of this gene was carried out from the same glands by comparing tanscription in microdissected normal prostatic epithelium versus that in microdissected invasive tumor. The transcript was over-expressed in 5 of 10 prostate carcinomas examined. A variant transcript was over-expressed in 4 of 4 prostate carcinomas, and was found in 1 of 4 normal samples. The invention provides a purified and isolated nucleic acid that includes the sequence of PB39 or its complement, the sequence of a variant of PB39 or its complement, and a primer or probe, that includes a sequence that is a fragment of these sequences. Additionally, the polypeptide encoded by these genes, an antibody to the polypeptide, and methods of detection of PB39 or its gene product are provided.

<DESCRIPTION>
 PB39, A GENE DYSREGULATED IN PROSTATE CANCER, AND USES THEREOFFIELD OF THE INVENTIONThis invention relates to a novel gene. PB39, and variants thereof, which is dys- regulated in prostate cancer. This invention also relates to polypeptides encoded by these genes, antibodies to the polypeptides, and to methods for detection of PB39, variants thereof, and/or its gene product. These methods can be used to assess the presence of precancerous or cancerous cells in the prostate gland.BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTIONProstate cancer is the most common malignancy in men and the second leading cause of cancer mortality in the United States (Wingo P. et al., Cancer statistics, Cancer J Clin 45: 8-30 (1995)). The disease can progress with markedly different clinical outcomes. An understanding of the difference between aggressive and nonaggressive tumors at the molecular level has been hindered by the diverse cell types present in the prostate gland and an inability to derive pure cell populations for genetic study.The Gleason score is a reliable prognosticator for disease progression at both ends of the histologic spectrum (<4 or â‰¥S). Poor disease outcome in the more prevalent Gleason range (5 to 7) is best predicted by a positive surgical margin, capsular penetration, and seminal vesicle invasion (Epstein J. et al., Prediction of progression following radical prostatectomy: a multivariate analysis of 721 men with long-term follow-up, Am J SurgPathol 20: 286-292 (1996)). However, these parameters can only be assessed after major surgery. Certain cases of prostate cancer respond to surgical and/or pharmaceutical intervention. Others metastasize rapidly, by mechanisms that remain poorly understood, to tissues such as bone. Currently available diagnostic methods directed to the detection of prostate cancer focus largely on prostate specific antigen (PSA). This protein is known to be a glycosylated serine protease, and is produced in relatively large quantities in the epithelial cells of the 

prostate and is secreted in seminal fluid. Smaller amounts are detected in the serum of healthy individuals; higher serum concentrations are thought to be correlated with pathological conditions such as prostate cancer. Other diagnostic methods address nucleic acids differentially expressed in prostate cancer. U. S. Patent 5,674,682 issued Oct. 7, 1997. to Croce et al. relates to methods for detecting prostate cancer micrometastasis, in which a sample containing nucleic acids is amplified and probed by hybridization to particular
