<ABSTRACT>
An ignition system (K) for an internal combustion 
engine, comprising: a tubular insulating member (1) which 

has a through-hole (1a); a tubular terminal (2A) which is 
mounted in an upper portion of the through-hole (1a); an 

ignition coil (3) which has a first terminal (4); the first 
terminal (4) being fitted into an upper portion of the 

terminal (2A) so as to be electrically connected to the 
terminal (2A); a coiled spring (15) which is attached to a 

lower portion of the terminal (2A) and is loosely fitted 
into a lower portion of the through-hole (1a); a spark plug 

(6) which has a second terminal (7) fitted into the 
through-hole (1a) from a lower portion of the insulating 

member (1); the second terminal (7) being brought into 
contact with the coiled spring (15) so as to be electrically 

connected to the coiled spring (15); and a buckling 
preventive portion (1b) for reducing an inside diameter 

(d1, d2) of the through-hole (1a), which is provided at a 
portion of the through-hole (1a) between the lower portion 

of the terminal (2A) and an upper portion of the second 
terminal (7) so as to prevent buckling of an intermediate 

portion of the coiled spring (15).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention generally relates to an 
ignition system for an internal combustion engine as described in the first part of claim 1 and more 
particularly, to an improved construction for connecting an 
ignition coil and a spark plug in the ignition system. In a known ignition system for an internal 
combustion engine, a tubular terminal 2A or 2B is mounted 
in an upper portion of a through-hole 1a of a tubular 
insulating member 1 and an electrode 4 of an ignition coil 
3 is fitted into an upper portion of the terminal 2A or 2B 
so as to be electrically connected to the terminal 2A or 2B 
as shown in Fig. 1 or Fig. 2. Meanwhile, a coiled spring 
5 attached to a lower portion of the terminal 2A and 2B is 
loosely fitted into a lower portion of the through-hole 1a 
of the insulating member 1. Furthermore, an electrode 7 of 
a spark plug 6 is fitted into the through-hole 1a from a 
lower end of the insulating member 1 and is brought into 
contact with the coiled spring 5 so as to be electrically 
connected to the terminal 2A or 2B. Meanwhile, in Figs. 1 
and 2, reference numeral 8 denotes a mounting hole formed 
in a cylinder head of the engine. In the known ignition 
system, a distance L1 or L2 (L1<L2) between the electrode 
4 of the ignition coil 3 and the electrode 7 of the spark 
plug 6 varies according to types of the internal combustion 
engine. In case the distances L1 and L2 are different from 
each other as described above, lengths H1 and H2 (H1<H2) of  
 
the insulating member 1 are also different from each other 
and a length H3 of the terminal 2A is also different from 
a length H4 (H3<H4) of the terminal 2B. Therefore, in 
accordance with variations of the distance L1 or L2 between 
the electrode 4 of the ignition coil 3 and the electrode 7 
of the spark plug 6, different molding dies for producing 
the insulating member 1 and the terminal 2A or 2B having 
different lengths should be prepared, thereby resulting in 
production cost of the ignition system. Meanwhile, since the 
number of kinds of the components of the ignition system increases, 
control of the components becomes complicated, so that such 
a possibility exists that wrong components are used for the 
ignition system, thereby resulting in deterioration of 
reliability of the ignition system. In order to obviate this problem, it may be 
considered that the terminal 2A having the length H3 
shorter than the length H4 of the terminal 2B is used in 
common for the lengths L1 and L2 between the electrode 4 of 
the ignition coil
