<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a method for hydraulically controlling a link-type or a toggle press and a link-type or toggle press with a control system adapted for carrying out the method. An innovative feature is that in the operating region of the press ram (3), the speed of the driving piston rod (2) is increased at least once. The speed of the ram (3) is therefore kept relatively constant until the lower part is reached.

A method of hydraulically controlling a piston rod (2) of a working cylinder (1) of a toggle-joint
or knuckle-joint system of a toggle-joint or knuckle-joint press, in which the press ram speed is

reduced before reaching the cutting phase (contact of the tool with the workpiece) and the press
force of the ram (3) is increased, characterized in that the speed of advancing movement of the

piston rod (2) is increased at least once after reaching the cutting point and before initiating the
return movement.
A method according to claim 1, characterized in that the speed of the advancing and return
movement of the piston rod (2) is controlled - preferably through mechanical contact elements - in

dependence on the stroke of the press ram (30, wherein the piston rod (2) is optionally moved also
in its return movement with different drive speeds.
A method according to claim 1 or 2, characterized in that the speed of the piston rod (2) is
increased at least twice after reaching the cutting point.
A method according to any one of the preceding claims, characterized in that the speed variation is
effected through the - optionally stepless - switching out or in of hydraulically acting piston

surfaces (8 - 10).
A toggle-joint or knuckle-joint press with a hydraulically controlled cylinder and piston
arrangement, in which the press ram speed is reduced before reaching the cutting phase (contact

of the tool with the workpiece) and the press force of the ram (3) is increased, characterized in that
hydraulic valves are provided for the control and are connected indirectly or directly from a

stroke-dependent feedback element (14; 115) which detects the stroke of the piston rod (2) or the
press ram (3), wherein the speed of advancing movement of the piston rod (2) is increased at least

once after reaching the cutting point and before initiating the return movement.
A press according to claim 5, characterized in that at least one differential cylinder with at least
one integrated plunger/cylinder (11) is provided as the cylinder and piston arrangement.
A press according to claim 5, characterized in that the speed variation is effected through the -
optionally stepless - switching out or in of hydraulically acting piston surfaces (8 - 10). 
A press according to any one of the preceding claims 5 to 7, characterized in that at least one cylinder
of the cylinder and piston arrangement (1) is fixed to the ram.
A press according to any of the preceding claims 5 to 8, characterized in that at least one working
cylinder - especially for the return movement of the press ram (3) - is provided alongside a

differential cylinder with at least one integrated plunger/cylinder (11).
A press according to any of the preceding claims 5 to 9, characterized in that at least one
auxiliary working cylinder (44) with its piston rod connected to the press arm (3) is disposed

alongside at least one main working cylinder (13) - preferably a differential cylinder with
integrated plunger/cylinder (11) - fixed to the ram, with its piston rod (2) connected to the

knuckle joint (5 - 7).
