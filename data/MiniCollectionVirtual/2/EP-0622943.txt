<ABSTRACT>
A circuit for handling power dissipation through telephone subscriber 
line power supply interface devices using a pair of final stages (4,5) 

to which an external component (3) effective to dissipate power is 
connected. 
The largest current supplied into the line is controlled by discrete 
reference circuit means (11,12,13) to which the final stages may be 

connected upon the longitudinal current on the line exceeding a 
predetermined value. 
On that occurrence, the external component (3) is also disabled.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a circuit for handling power
dissipation through telephone subscriber line power supply
interface devices, in particular a monolithically
integratable telephone interface devices.Further, the invention relates to a circuit for handling
power dissipation through a telephone subscriber line power
supply interface device using a pair of amplifier final
stages provided with output terminals which are coupled to
the line and comparator circuit means effective to compare
the mean value of the longitudinal current on the line with a
predetermined threshold value.The incorporation of such devices to telephone exchanges of
ever more compact design requires that new designs be evolved
for circuits and systems to provide improved power
distribution and active power control under any operating
conditions.Power distribution consists of using an auxiliary element
(e.g. an external transistor) connected to each interface
device, which auxiliary element is effective to dissipate
some of the power.Under certain exceptionally severe conditions of the line,
and in the presence of longitudinal currents due to one or
both of the line wires being temporarily connected to ground
("ground key" situation), or to failures in the line ("fault"
situation), the dissipated power may fall outside the upper
admissible limits by standard packages even in the presence
of an external auxiliary element adapted to dissipate some of
the power.Longitudinal current has been defined in the
telecommunication arts as being the current which flows from 
ground to one of either the tip or ring leads as discussed in
published UK Patent Application No. GB -A-2 199 719.Known in the art are arrangements for limiting the largest
current supplied to the line, and hence the amount of power
dissipated.Such prior arrangements, while performing their expected
function satisfactorily in normal operation of the telephone
system, are unable to operate effectively when the line is
subjected to a longitudinal or common mode current at a non-zero
mean value. In fact, when the load draws a longitudinal current from the
supply line, the above-mentioned prior devices fail to
perform their function because the cut-in threshold of the
limiter arrangement is usually above the value of the current
flowing through the line.Telephone systems normally incorporate a thermal protection
device which is operated upon the temperature reaching a
predetermined upper threshold level to change the operational
characteristics of the protected system and,

A circuit for handling power dissipation through a
telephone subscriber line power supply interface device

using a pair of amplifier final stages (4, 5) provided with
output terminals which are coupled to the line (2) and

comparator circuit means (6) effective to compare the mean
value of the longitudinal current on the line with a

predetermined threshold value, the comparator circuit
means in turn driving a program unit (8) adapted to set

respective limiting currents supplied to the amplifier
final stages (4,5) and thereby limit the currents into the

line from the amplifier final stages, 
characterized in that

the program unit (8) comprises at least first (11) and
second (12), as well as a third (13), reference circuit

means effective to set, in the final stages of the device
(4 and 5) to which they are coupled, predetermined

different values for the largest admissible currents
supplied to the line, resulting in the device power

dissipation being controlled by limiting the largest
current being supplied into the line according to the value

of the longitudinal current present on the line.
A circuit according to Claim 1, 
characterized in that

the program unit (8) further comprises connection and
switching circuit means (10) connected between the final

stages of the device and said comparator circuit means (6).
A circuit according to Claim 2, 
characterized in that

the comparator circuit means (6) enable connection of both
final stages to the first reference circuit means (11) at

mean values of the longitudinal current below a
predetermined threshold value, and at mean values of that

current above said threshold value, enable connection of
the device final stages, the one to the second (12) and the

other to the third (13) of said reference circuit means, or 
vice versa, according to the sense of the common mode

current on the line.
A circuit according to Claim 3, 
characterized in that

the second and third reference circuit means are effective
to set such values for the largest output currents from the

final stages as to cause them to differ from each other by
a larger value than the threshold value.
A circuit according to any of the preceding claims, and
comprising at least one external component (3) effective to

dissipate power connected to the interface device, that
external component being driven into conduction by control

circuit means (7) responsive to the transversal line
current, 
characterized in that
 such control circuit means
(7) are coupled to the comparator circuit means (6) and

disable the external component upon the mean value of the
longitudinal current exceeding the threshold value.
