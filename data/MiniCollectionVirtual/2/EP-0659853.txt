<ABSTRACT>
The following description sets forth paints consisting of aqueous 
dispersions of mixtures of fluorinated polymers, polyphenylene 

sulphides and acrylic polymers, in addition to pigments and 
surfactants, that may be rolled on aluminium disks before machine 

moulding of same into cookware provided with a non-stick lining.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to rollable water paints for the
antistick coating of aluminium cookware and procedure for their
application.The term "cookware" is used herein to mean pots and relevant lids,
pans, baking pans, oven trays, toaster or oven racks, kitchen
utensils, spatulas, mixing spoons, and all other utensils usually
employed for food preparation and cooking.The use of non-stick cookware has extraordinarily increased during
the last 30 years. Consequently, studies have been and are-still
being conducted to develop non-stick paint formulations and relevant
methods of application to the pot and pan surface coming into
contact with food.Several materials are suitable for cookware production, but non-stick
coated pans and pots are mainly made of aluminium.Particularly successful non-stick water paints are based on
fluorinated polymers (PTFE).With a view to overcoming the difficulty of non-sticking water paints
based on PTFE to metal surfaces, several methods for the treatment
of said surfaces before paint application, e.g. simple degreasing or
pickling or sand-blasting, have been studied. Furthermore, very
many formulations based on PTFE combined with other components to
be laid on the metal surface in a single application or with more
coats, each coat preferably being of a different composition, were 
developed.For example. a particularly effective way of pickling an aluminium
surface for non-stick paint application is disclosed in Italian
patent No. 1,226,347 by the Applicant.The use of ternary mixtures based on PTFE, polyarylene sulphide
resins (PAS), in particular polyphenylene sulphide (PPS), and
polyamido-imidic (PAI) and/or polyimidic resins (PI), for the
preparation of water paints exhibiting improved surface strength and
adhesion to supports is described in DE 2.755.364. This document
teaches the use of polyimidic (or polyamido-imidic) resin in amounts
comprised in very large range namely from 5 to 0.33 parts by weight per
part of polyphenylene sulfide.A composition containing PTFE, colloidal silica, a polyamide aminic
salt, a coalescence agent, and mica particles at appropriate ratios
meant for improving the adhesion of PTFE to the metal substrate is
described in British patent No. GB 1,565,842.A formulation comprising PAI or polyethersulphonic resins (PES)
combined with at least two different types of PTFE of very different
viscosities on melting, which stratifies in a first layer on the
metal, with PTFE being mainly concentrated in the external part of
the paint layer, is

Rollable water paint for aluminium disks consisting of
aqueous dispersion containing mixtures of polytetrafluoroethylene

(PTFE), polyphenylene sulphide (PPS), polyamido-imidic resin
(PAI) and carbon black, characterized in that the PAI content

ranges between 5% and 10% by weight and the carbon black content
ranges between 10% and 15% by weight referred to PTFE + PPS + PAI as

a whole and further the ratio by weight (by w.) of PTFE
to PPS ranges between 35:65 and 80:20 and the water content

ranges between 40% and 65% by weight.
The water paint according to claim 1 wherein the ratio by w.
of PTFE to PPS ranges between 35:65 and 55:45.
The water paint according to claim 1 wherein the ratio by w.
of PTFE to PPS ranges between 55:45 and 80:20.
Procedure for painting aluminium disks to be drawn into
cookware characterized in that it comprises the steps of:


a) degreasing the aluminium disk to be drawn into cookware by
alkaline treatment at 30 to 50°C;
b) rolling a first layer of water paint according to claim 2;
c) hot-air drying (at 120°C max.) of the layer until no aftertack
to the touch;
d) rolling a second water paint layer as per step b), except that
water paint is according to claim 3;
e) hot-air drying (at 120°C max.) of the layer until no aftertack 
to the touch;
f) rolling a third water paint layer based on PTFE and not
containing PPS and PAI;
g) hot-air drying (at 120°C max.) of the layer until no aftertack
to the touch;
h) heat treatment of the disk provided with three dried paint
layers, at a temperature of 400°C to 430°
C for a period of 5 to 2
minutes.
The procedure of painting according to claim 4 characterized
in that in the steps b) and d) the amount of paint is

rolled so that each paint layer has a thickness
(after drying) of 2-10 µm and in step f) the amount of

paint is rolled so that a paint layer has a
thickness of 5-20 µm.
The procedure of painting according to claim 4 characterized
in that in step b) and d) the thickness of each layer is 5 µm and

in step f) the paint layer is 10 µm.
The procedure of painting according to claim 4 characterized
in that it is carried out in continuous and in-line with a 6 to

20 m/min. speed of the belt transferring aluminium disks to
painting.
The procedure of painting according to claim 4 characterized
in that the steps b) and c), d) and e), f) and g) are repeated,

if so required, by causing the disk to pass under the paint roll 
unit several times, each time providing a paint layer of 5 µm

max. to obtain a layer of the desired thickness.
