<ABSTRACT>
Convolutionally encoded information subjected to channel intersymbol 
interference is decoded by calculating the minimum cost path through a trellis. The 

trellis terminates in known states. Exploiting the open architecture of the coprocessor 
(7) 

E.C.C.P., the minimum cost state is checked to ascertain if it is the known, that 
is, correct state and if it is not, the possible known states are searched by the DSP (7) 

inside the ECCP active register and the state with the lowest cost amount the 
possible states is selected.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to receivers for digital
communications, and to methods for determining a state
having an extremum cost from a group of states each
having an associated cost.Although telecommunications technology originally developed using
copper wires as the transmission media, there is much interest and commercial
activity in wireless technology using free space as the transmission media. Wireless
technology frees the user from the physical constraint of needing an electrical
connection to the transmission media, and is therefore extremely useful to people
engaged in activities such as automobile driving.Initial commercial activity developing wireless technology used analog
transmission. In the interests of increasing the efficiency of spectrum utilization,
digital transmission systems have been developed and it is certain that ultimately a
majority of wireless telecommunications will utilize digital transmission systems.
Digital systems transmit information as either 0s or 1s. Accurate information
transmission depends upon being able to reliably detect transmitted 1s as 1s and 0s
as 0s. Accurate detection is not always a simple matter because of factors such as
low received signal power and multiple transmission paths caused by, for example,
reflecting objects between the transmitter and receiver. Error correction techniques
have been developed to increase the accuracy of digital communications systems.Several techniques that have been developed or utilized to improve the
accuracy of the communications system will be briefly described. The information
may be convolutionally encoded; this encoding technique reduces the effects of burst
channel noise by interleaving the bits of the data stream, that is, the transmitted
information. Accuracy of transmission is further improved by the inclusion of
encoded multiple bits, in place of single bits in the bit stream, which are used for
error correction in the decoding process. An exemplary error correction scheme uses
the Viterbi algorithm; use of the Viterbi algorithm is not, however, limited to
convolutional codes. It is also applicable to maximum likelihood sequence
estimation (MLSE) equalization and other coded bit streams. See, Mobile Radio
Communications, R. Steele, ed., Chapter 4 Channel Coding by Wong and Hanzo for
an exposition of convolutional encoding and the Viterbi algorithm.The Viterbi decoder is a maximum likelihood decoder scheme that
provides forward error correction. See, for example, United States Patent 4,493,082
issued on January
