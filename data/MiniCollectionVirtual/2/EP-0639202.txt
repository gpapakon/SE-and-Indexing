<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to stable polypeptide
compositions and methods of preparing such stable
compositions.Polypeptides possess chemical and physical
properties that present special problems which can cause
instability in storage and delivery, particularly of
biologically active polypeptides. Usually polypeptides
are lyophilized to form solid compositions. Often,
additives are introduced into polypeptide formulations in
an effort to increase stability. Such additives have
included salts of ionic compounds, polyalcohols, but this
is less effective at higher concentrations of such
additive, and detergents, both nonionic and anionic,
particularly for transdermal and intranasal
administration. Many of the instability problems of
protein pharmaceuticals are discussed in Manning et al.,
Pharm. Res. (1989) 6 (11):903-918.European patents 311,950, 286,830 and 288,891 and
U.S. patents 4,361,510 and 4,470,968 describe separation
processes that use of one or usually more than one of
various additives such as 3-propiolactone; various Tris,
hepes, glycine or citrate buffers, polyols or alkanols;
salts, such as sodium chloride or sodium, potassium or
lithium citrate, in preparing or purifying proteins but
with a pH above at least 5.5 and preferably usually 6, if 
not 7-8. Usually the protein is removed from these
additives and preferably lyophilized.However, many polypeptides are useful as
biologically active materials which are most useful when
injected directly into an animal. This is the case for
polypeptides useful as therapeutic agents for the
treatment and prevention of platelet-associated ischemic
disorders initiated by atherosclerosis and
arteriosclerosis.In treatment of some life-threatening results of
these disorders it can be necessary to inject the patient
with a drug concentrate as quickly as possible (bolus
treatment) and/or followed by prolonged (infusion)
treatment with a lower drug concentration. Accordingly,
the drug, which may be a polypeptide, must be stored
conveniently for immediate use by hospital personnel and
paramedics. This means it must be storage-stable for
long periods, even at room temperature, and already in an
injectable liquid formulation, not a solid which must be
dissolved.Because the drug is injectable, it must be
formulated as simply as possible to be as compatible as
possible with the patient so as to not induce other
traumas or interfere with other drugs being given to the
patient. The ideal formulation would avoid other
additives normally required for stabilization and
