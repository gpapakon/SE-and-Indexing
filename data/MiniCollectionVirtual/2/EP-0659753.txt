<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a new silacyclohexane compound,
a method of preparing it, and a liquid crystal composition
which contains it, as well as a liquid crystal display element
which contains said liquid crystal composition.A liquid crystal display element utilizes the optical
anisotropy and dielectric anisotropy of liquid crystal substances.
Display modes include the TN mode (twisted nematic mode), the
STN mode (super twisted nematic mode), the SBE mode (super
birefringence mode), the DS mode (dynamic scattering mode),
the guest-host mode, the DAP mode ("deformation of aligned
phase" mode) and the OMI mode (optical mode interference mode).
The most common display device has a twisted nematic structure
based on the Schadt-Helfrich mode.The properties required of the liquid crystal substance
used in these liquid crystal displays are somewhat different 
depending on the display method. However, a wide liquid crystal
temperature range and stability with regard to moisture, air,
light, heat, electric fields, etc., are properties commonly
required by all display methods. Furthermore, it is desirable
for the liquid crystal material to have a low viscosity, and
also to have a short address time, low threshold voltage and
high contrast in the cell(s).Currently, there is no single compound which satisfies
all these requirements. In practice, liquid crystal mixtures
are obtained by mixing several to more than ten liquid crystal
compounds and latent liquid crystal compounds. Because of
this, it is also important that the components of a liquid
crystal composition mix easily.Among liquid crystal compounds which can be these components,
one of the basic components conventionally known which, in
particular, control the ability to assume the liquid crystal
phase at high temperatures is a compound which has the cyclohexyl
ring-biphenyl-cyclohexyl ring structure, a so-called CBC structure,
such as

(Tokko Hei 4-28693),

(Tokko Hei 4-28693), and

(Tokko Hei 4-28693) have been known.In recent years, along with the expansion of the applications
of liquid crystal displays, the characteristics required of
liquid crystal materials are becoming more and more advanced
and demanding. In particular, superior characteristics such
as improved low temperature performance, a wider temperature
range for automobile onboard use and a lower driving voltage,
compared with conventional liquid crystal substances, are desired. From such a viewpoint, this invention is a newly
