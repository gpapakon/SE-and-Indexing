<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a method for increasing 
the precision of the components in an impression system 

for dental prostheses of the type which are permanently 
anchored in the jaw by means of one or more securing 

elements (fixtures) implanted in the jawbone. Each one of 
the securing elements is provided with a distance member 

(2) whose upper part protrudes above the palatal arch and 
on which the finished dental bridge/dental prosthesis is 

then anchored via a so-called gold cylinder. The system 
includes impression components in the form of impression 

tops (1) and distance dummies (9) with continuous guide 
holes (5) and stop members (6) for a guide pin (4) which, 

during fixing of the components, is guided through the 
respective guide hole and engages with the stop members 

(6) of the respective impression component. That part of 
the guide pin (4) which interacts with the stop members 

(6) of the guide holes (5) of the respective impression 
component (1, 9) has a conical stop surface (11), while 

the stop members form plane surfaces and guide edges (6', 
6''). By means of the design of the guide pin, the 

components are centred and the precision is improved in 
existing impression systems.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method for
increasing the precision of impression-taking and
production of dental prostheses of the type which are
permanently anchored in the jaw by means of one or more
securing elements implanted in the jawbone. Each one of
these securing elements is provided with a distance
member whose upper part protrudes above the palatal arch
and on which the finished dental prosthesis/dental bridge
is then anchored via a so-called gold cylinder.Dental bridges which are anchored in this way on
distance members must be carefully adapted to the actual
appearance of the jaw. The way in which this can be done
is shown, for example, in Swedish Patent 446371 which
describes how a positive working model of a lower or
upper jaw provided with protruding distance members of
this type can be produced. The impression system which is
used there includes components such as impression tops
and distance dummies which are fixed with the aid of
guide pins.A positive working model of the jaw obtained in
this way is used by the dental technician for producing
the finished dental prosthesis/dental bridge. In this way
he does not have to carry out the time-consuming and
complicated work involved in adapting the prosthesis
directly in the patient's mouth, and instead he works
with a model of the patient's jaw. The production of the
positive working model is facilitated with the aid of the
components included in the impression system, namely the
impression tops, distance dummies, gold cylinders and
guide pins. The ways in which the various impression
components are used are already known per se and will
therefore not be described in detail here. However, it
will be noted that the impression technique and the
production of the model comprise four stages:
the impression top is placed on the distance
member, the distance dummy is placed on the impression
top,the impression top is placed on the gold
cylinder,the gold cylinder is placed on the distance
member.In the first three stages a guide pin is used to
fix the components to each other, while the gold cylinder
is fixed on the distance member with the aid of a gold
screw. Since the components always have a certain
tolerance deficit, a degree of error is introduced during
each of the four stages. The errors add up and can lead
to stresses being built into the finished dental bridge.To be more specific, the tolerance deficit
results in the centre of the various components ending up
eccentric upon assembly. A guide pin is admittedly used
which can

Method for increasing the precision of an
impression system for dental prostheses of the type which

are permanently anchored in the jaw by means of one or
more securing elements implanted in the jawbone and each

provided with a distance member (2) whose upper part
protrudes above the palatal arch and on which the

finished dental prosthesis/dental bridge is then anchored
via a so-called gold cylinder, the system including

impression components in the form of impression tops (1)
and distance dummies (9) with continuous guide holes (5)

and stop members (6) for a guide pin (4) which, during
fixing of the components, is guided through the respective

guide hole and engages with the stop members (6) of
the respective impression component, and

that part of the guide pin (4) which interacts with
the stop members (6) of the guide holes (5) of the

respective impression component (1, 9) has a conical stop
surface (11), characterized in that

the conical guide pin interacts with stop members which
form plane surfaces

and guide edges (6', 6'').
Method according to Patent Claim 1, characterized
in that twice the cone angle 2(α) of the stop surface

(11) of the guide pin lies within the range of
15° ≤ 2α ≤ 90°.
Method according to Patent Claim 1, characterized
in that the play of the guide edges is minimized between

distance member (2) and impression top (1) and between
impression top (1) and distance dummy (9), while an

intentional and adapted play is present between gold
cylinder and distance member (2).
Method according to Patent Claim 3, characterized
in that the intentional play present between gold

cylinder and distance member lies within the range of
0.05 - 0.2 mm.
Method according to Patent Claim 3, characterized
in that the tolerance ranges for distance member (2),

impression top (1) and distance dummy (9), in addition to
being minimized, are placed edge to edge with each other, 

while the tolerance range of the gold cylinder is placed
with the said adapted play in relation to the distance

member (2).
