<ABSTRACT>
In the installation proposed, an air duct (16) runs parallel to and below the linear trackway (8) of a travelling cleaner (10), and the cleaner trackway and air duct run above a row (6) of looms (4). Fitted above each loom on the underside of the air duct (16) is a downwards-facing air displacement flow outlet (20) which is supplied with suitably conditioned air from the air duct. Fitted in the floor (24) below each loom is an air outlet (28) which is linked to an air-extraction duct (32). The air extracted by the air-extraction duct (32) is conditioned in an air-conditioning installation and then fed back into the air duct (16). The fact that the air duct is mounted parallel to the travelling-cleaner trackway permits the installation to be designed so that it is simple and less costly.

<CLAIMS>
Apparatus for influencing the ambient conditions 
of textile machines, with a runway (8; 108; 208) extending 

above the textile machines (4; 104) and with at least 
one travelling cleaner (10; 110; 210) moving on the 

runway, characterized in that there extends parallel to 
the runway of the travelling cleaner an air channel (16; 

116; 216) which, for each textile machine, supplies at 
least one d
ownward-directed piston-flow outlet (20; 120; 
220) arranged at a predetermined distance above the work 

zones of the machines, in that the air channel is connected 
to an air-treatment system, and in that exhaust-air 

ports (30) for each machine are arranged in the 
region of the floor and are connected to a suction 

channel (32). 
Apparatus according to Claim 1, characterized in 
that the runway (8; 108; 208) of the travelling cleaner 

(10; 110; 210) is formed by rails (48; 148; 248) which 
are supported jointly with the air channel (16; 116; 

216). 
Apparatus according to Claim 1 or 2, characterized 
in that the piston-flow outlets (20; 220) are formed 

on the air channel (16; 216). 
Apparatus according to Claim 1, characterized in 
that the runway (8; 208) of the travelling cleaner (10; 

210) is provided directly on the air channel (16; 216) 
and is supported jointly with the latter, and in that the 

piston-flow outlets (20; 220) are formed by outlet boxes 
(84; 284) provided on one wall of the air channel. 
Apparatus according to Claim 4, characterized in 
that the air channel (16; 216) forms rails (48; 248) as  

 
a runway (8; 208) for the travelling cleaner (10; 210). 
Apparatus according to Claim 4 or 5, characterized 
in that busbars (54) for driving the travelling 

cleaner (10) are provided on the air channel (16). 
Apparatus according to Claim 4, 5 or 6, characterized 
in that the air channel (16) is designed as a 

carrier for lighting bodies (58) and the current and 
compressed-air supply of the weaving machines (4). 
Apparatus according to one of the preceding 
claims, characterized in that the air channel (16) is 

connected to an air-conditioning plant, to which the 
suction channel (30) is also connected. 
Apparatus according to Claim 3, characterized in 
that each piston-flow outlet is preceded by a throttle 

member and/or closing member (192).
