<ABSTRACT>
Ceramic SiCO fibers are formed by spinning a 
mixture of a substantially linear polysiloxane fluid having 

unsaturated hydrocarbon substituents and a photoinitiator 
into a fiber, exposing the fiber to radiation and heating the 

fiber in an inert environment to a temperature of at least 
800°C.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention is a method of preparing SiCO 
ceramic fibers in which a composition comprising a 
substantially linear polysiloxane fluid is used as the 
ceramic fiber precursor. Small diameter, polymer-derived SiCO ceramic fibers 
are useful as the reinforcing phase in composite structures. 
Numerous methods for the preparation of these fibers are 
known in the art and several are used commercially. The most 
common approach has been to start with a polycarbosilane 
polymeric precursor. This precursor, however, presents 
several difficulties. For instance, the cage-like molecular 
structure of polycarbosilane makes it difficult to spin. 
Similarly, the polymer's slow crosslinking and the green 
fiber's fragility inhibit the use of continuous processing. The use of polysiloxane resins as precursors to 
SiCO fibers is also known in the art. For instance, 
published European Patent Application 0 435 065 teaches 
forming green fibers from a preceramic polymeric precursor 
comprising phenyl-containing polyorganosiloxane resins, doping 
the green fibers with boron and pyrolyzing the green fibers to 
form polycrystalline SiC fibers. These resins, however, which 
are generally solid at room temperature, are also difficult to 
spin and the green fibers can be fragile. The present inventor has now discovered that a 
composition comprising substantially linear polysiloxanes, as 
compared to the resins described above, can be easily drawn 
into fibers. These fibers can be rapidly cured into green 
fibers which are considerably tougher than those made from 
resinous precursors and, upon pyrolysis, produce SiCO fibers. EPA 0 490 401 describes a process for the preparation of 
siloxy-endblocked polysiloxanes of a specified general formula 
containing both alkylhydrosiloxane units and alkylvinylsiloxane 
units which are useful as starting materials in the preparation 
of silicon oxycarbide ceramic compositions. EPA 0 490 401 
further describes a silicon oxycarbide ceramic composition and 
a process for the conversion of the polysiloxane to the silicon 
oxycarbide ceramic composition which process comprises heating  
 
the polysiloxane to a temperature ranging from about 500 to 
1300°C in an inert atmosphere consisting of nitrogen or argon 
at ambient pressure. It is mentioned that shaping, spinning 
and casting of the polysiloxanes can be performed in 
commercially available equipment designed for such purpose and 
known to those skilled in the art. The examples, however, 
illustrate only the casting method for
