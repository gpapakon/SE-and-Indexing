<ABSTRACT>
The present invention provides a packaging material for use in packaging horticultural produce. The packaging material of the present invention comprises a first sheet which is impermeable to water vapour and liquid water and a film which is capable of absorbing at least 10 % of its weight of water from liquid water after being equilibrated with an atmosphere saturated with water vapour. In preferred forms of the invention the film comprises a layer of fibrous hydrophilic materials such as paper made from cellulose fibre or other hydrophilic fibres. Alternatively, the film comprises a polymer of polyvinyl alcohol which is able to absorb water from the vapour and from the liquid phase to form a water-swellable gel. The film may be bonded to the first sheet or it may be free. The present invention also provides a method of packaging produce involving the use of this packaging material.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a packaging
material and to a method of packaging horticultural
produce. The packaging material and method of packing
of the present invention enable the cooling of living
horticultural produce within the packaging material
with a greater than 90% reduction over current methods
in the condensation of water on the packed produce.When horticultural produce is harvested it begins
to deteriorate. The process of deterioration can be
retarded by cooling the produce as soon as possible
after harvest. Products that are relatively resistant
to cold are cooled to temperatures as close as
practicable to their freezing point, while many
tropical fruits, vegetables and flowers are cooled to
temperatures of 15째C or less. During subsequent
storage and transport to distant markets, the produce
is preferably maintained at a temperature as low as
possible, consistent with the resistance to cold of the
particular produce.In current practice, a number of different
techniques of cooling and methods of packaging are
used. Whatever methods are used, their sequence is
relevant to the invention described here.In the first procedure, the produce, which may be
a fruit, vegetable, harvested ornamental or a plant
still attached to its roots, is cooled before being
packaged to a temperature that approaches the optimum
temperature for storage. For many products, this will
be a temperature close to 0째C. The produce is then
packaged in a way that protects the produce during
subsequent storage and transport. In the second procedure, the reverse sequence is
used, with the produce being packaged before being
cooled.Whether one or the other sequence is used depends
on the nature of the crop, the length of storage
desired and the facilities available. If condensation
is likely to harm the commodity, the first sequence is
to be preferred. However, a number of considerations
often make it difficult or impossible to achieve in
current practice. These considerations are detailed
below.
1. If the produce is cooled before packing, it will
tend to warm during packing. To prevent this, the
packing operation should be performed at the
temperature of storage. However, packers must be paid
higher rates to work at such low temperatures and in
any case the provision of controlled temperatures in a
packing area is expensive.2. If the produce is destined for extended storage,
dehydration must be prevented by using packaging that
is a barrier to the loss of water. This will result in
relative humidities around the produce

<CLAIMS>
A method of packaging horticultural produce comprising packing the produce in a
packaging material comprising;


(i) a first sheet which is impermeable to water vapour and liquid water,
(ii) a second sheet which is permeable to water vapour, and
(iii) a film positioned between the first and second sheets, which is capable of
absorbing at least 10% of its weight of water from liquid water after being equilibrated with

an atmosphere saturated with water vapour,

wherein the second sheet is facing the horticultural produce.
A method as claimed in claim 1 in which the film comprises a layer of fibrous
hydrophilic material.
A method as claimed in claim 2 in which the film is paper made from cellulose fibres
or other hydrophilic fibres.
A method as claimed in claim 1 in which the film comprises a polymer of polyvinyl
alcohol and is able to absorb about 40 grams water per 100 grams dry film from the vapour

phase when in contact with air at 100% relative humidity, and about 70 grams per 100
grams dry film when in contact with water in the liquid phase.
A method as claimed in claim 4 in which the polyvinyl alcohol polymer is soluble in
water above 80째C and insoluble in water below 40째C.
A method as claimed in claim 4 or claim 5 in which the polyvinyl alcohol polymer is
free of low molecular weight compounds.
A method as claimed in any one of claims 1 to 6 in which the film is bonded to the
first sheet. 
A method as claimed in claim 7 in which the bonded area is less than 5% of the total
area of the film.
A method as claimed in any one of claims 1 to 8 in which the first sheet comprises a
film of polyethylene, polypropylene or a layer of wax.
A method as claimed in any one of the preceding claims in which the second sheet
is composed of a hydroph
obic polymer such that while it is freely permeable to water
vapour it offers resistance to the passage of liquid water.
