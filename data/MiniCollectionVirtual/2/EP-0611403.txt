<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates generally to the art of textiles
and more particularly to a plant structure for the open-end
spinning of textile fibers into yarn products.Various plant structures have existed for the production
of textile yarns for ultimately weaving or knitting into
desired fabric.Traditionally, two techniques of spinning have been
utilized, i.e. ring spinning and open-end spinning. An example
of open-end spinning is described in U.S. Patent No. 4,939,895
to Raasch, et al. assigned to W. Schlafhorst & Co. of Germany.
As described in this particular patent cans of coiled sliver
typically are positioned on the floor adjacent to an open-end
spinning apparatus and vertically bent upwardly into the open-end
spinning apparatus.An example of an open-end spinning apparatus is the
Autocoro 240 automatic rotor spinning and winding machine
produced and sold by W. Schlafhorst & Co. Further, other
apparatus and methods for spinning are known from US-A-3469385 representing the closest prior art,
and US-A-3816991.While plants have effectively operated utilizing the
arrangement as above described, room exists for improvement in
the overall plant operations utilizing such open-end spinning
devices.It is thus an aim of this invention to provide a novel
plant arrangement of an open-end spinning apparatus.It is a further and more particular aim of this
invention to provide such a novel open-end spinning apparatus
arrangement wherein the number of such open-end spinning
apparatuses may be maximized per square foot of the floor
maintaining such apparatus.It is a further and more particular aim of this
invention to provide a novel apparatus for feeding a sliver to 
an open-end spinning apparatus.It is a further and yet more particular aim of this
invention to provide a novel plant structure for housing
such open-end spinning apparatus.With these as well as other aims in mind, the present
invention provides in an open-end spinning apparatus having
means to receive sliver for the spinning thereof into yarn,
an improvement as defined in claim 1 hereinafter.The present invention further provides a plant structure
for the treatment of textile fibers to form such fibers as
yarn as defined in claim 2 hereinafter, and a process for
conditioning textile fibers as defined in claim 3
hereinafter.Specific embodiments of the present invention are now
described, by way of example only, with reference to the
accompanying drawings, in which:-Figure 1 of the drawings illustrates a plant structure in
accordance with this
</DESCRIPTION>
<CLAIMS>
An open-end spinning apparatus (11,13) having means
to receive sliver for the spinning thereof into yarn,

comprising:

a sliver feed tube (31,33) having an input end and a
withdrawal end for feeding sliver to said open-end spinning

apparatus (11,13), said sliver originating from a sliver
source disposed two floors above said open-end spinning

apparatus (11,13); and
said sliver feed tube (31,33) having a vertical portion,
an obtuse portion forming an obtuse angle with said vertical

portion at a lower end of said vertical portion, such that
said sliver travels downwardly through the vertical portion

and then through said obtuse portion;

   characterised in that

the tube ends up in a horizontal portion (41,43) such
that the sliver, after having travelled through the obtuse

portion, travels through said horizontal portion (41,43),
and
the inner wall of said tube defines an uninterrupted
smooth surface between said input and said withdrawal ends,

the diameter of the tube being such that the sliver can pass
down the tube in a snake-like fashion without significant

rubbing on the walls of the tube.
A plant structure (1) for the treatment of textile
fibers to form such fibers as yarn, comprising:


a building structure having first (3), second (5) and
third (7) floors therein;
at least first (11) and second (13) open-end spinning
apparatuses located adjacent one another on said first floor

(3);
a first sliver feed tube (31) on said second floor (5)
for directing sliver (17) from a can (15) located on said

second floor (5) to said first open-end spinning apparatus
(11), said feed tube (31) being hollow;
a second sliver feed tube (33) extending from said third 
floor (7) to said second open-end spinning apparatus (13)

for directing sliver (23) from a can (21) located on said
third floor (7) to said second open-end spinning apparatus

(13), said feed tube (33) being hollow; and
each said first (31) and second (33) sliver feed tubes
having a vertical portion and an obtuse portion forming an

obtuse angle with said vertical portion at a lower end of
said vertical portion, such that said sliver travels

downwardly through said vertical portion and then through
said obtuse portion;

   characterised in that

each tube ends up in a horizontal portion (41,43) such
that the sliver, after having travelled through the obtuse

portion, travels through said horizontal portion (41,43),
and
the inner wall of each tube defines an uninterrupted
smooth surface between said input and said withdrawal ends,

the diameter of the tube being such that the sliver can pass
down the tube in a snake-like fashion without significant

rubbing on the walls of the tube.
A process for conditioning textile fibers comprising the
steps of:


providing a structure (1) having first (3), second (5)
and third (7) levels;
providing on the second (5) and third (7) levels sliver
cans (15,21) having coiled therein sliver;
providing on said first level (3) open-end spinning
apparatuses (11,13);
feeding said sliver from said second (5) and third (7)
levels into input ends of a plurality of sliver feed tubes

(31,33), each said tube defining a hollow interior;
passing said sliver through a vertical portion of said
sliver feed tube (31,33);
passing said sliver through an angled portion of said
sliver feed tube (31,33); and
feeding said sliver (45,47) from an output end of said
sliver feed tube (31,33) to an open-end spinning apparatus 

(11,13) on said first level;

   characterised by

each sliver feed tube ending up in a horizontal portion
(41,43) such that the sliver, after being passed through

the obtuse portion, is passed through said horizontal
portion (41,43) before reaching the spinning apparatus

(11,13);
the inner wall of each sliver feed tube defining an
uninterrupted smooth surface between said input and said

output ends, the diameter of the tube being such that the
sliver can pass down the tube in a snake-like fashion

without significant rubbing on the walls of the tube;
providing optimum temperature and humidity conditions
on said second (5) and third (7) levels for conditioning

said sliver; and
providing on said first level (3) an optimum temperature
and humidity environment for spinning sliver into yarn.

claim 1 wherein said sliver feed tube (31,33) has an inner

arcuate wall and provides a passage for said sliver which is
unobstructed at all points inside said passage.
In an open-end spinning apparatus (11,13) according to
claim 1 wherein said sliver feed tube (31,33) is made from

an extruded transparent material.
