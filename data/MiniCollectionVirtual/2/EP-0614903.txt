<ABSTRACT>
Novel phosphine compounds are represented by 
formulae (I) and (II): 


wherein the R substituents have the significations defined 
in the specification and are useful in the form of their 

transition metal complexes, or of compounds with transition 
metals, in producing an optically active aldehyde by 

hydroformylation of an olefin with high positional and 
steric selectivities. A 4-[(R)-1'-formylethyl]
azetidin-2-one 
derivative obtainable by the process is particularly 

useful as an intermediate for the preparation of carbapenem 
antibiotics.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a process for producing an
optically active aldehyde using a combination of the
phosphine compound and a transition metal; and to a process for
producing an intermediate for carbapenem antiobiotics using
a combination of the phosphine compound and a transition
metal.A large number of reports have been made on transition
metal complex catalysts useful for organic syntheses, such
as asymmetric hydrogenation, asymmetric hydrosilylation,
and asymmetric hydroformylation.In particular, many complexes exhibiting excellent
catalytic activity in asymmetric syntheses are found among
those comprising a transition metal, e.g., rhodium or
ruthenium, and an optically active tertiary phosphine
compound as a ligand (e.g. EP-A-0104375; WO-A-9303839; US-A-5171892;
EP-A-0503884). To improve the activity of these
catalysts, various phosphine compounds having a special
structure have been developed to date as disclosed, e.g.,
in 
Nippon Kagakukai (ed.), KAGAKU SOSETSU, Vol. 32, "YUKI
KINZOKU NO KAGAKU", pp. 237-238 (1982).Attention being directed only to asymmetric
hydroformylation using a transition metal-phosphine complex
as a catalyst, known techniques include a reaction using a
rhodium complex containing optically active 2,3-O-isopropylidene-2,3-dihydroxy-1,4-bis(diphenylphosphino)butane
(hereinafter abbreviated as DIOP) as a ligand (see J. Org.
Chem., Vol. 46, p. 4422 (1981)), a reaction using a rhodium
complex containing an optically active bidentate phosphine
compound (e.g., DIOP) as a ligand (see Bull. Chem. Soc. Jpn.,
Vol. 52, p. 2605 (1979)), and asymmetric hydroformylation of
methyl acetamidoacrylate using a rhodium complex containing
DIOP, etc. as a ligand (see Tetrahedron Asymmetry, Vol. 10,
p. 693 (1990)).Known complexes containing an optically active
tertiary phosphite as a ligand include those containing a
bis(triarylphosphite) ligand having an optically active
binaphthyl skeleton disclosed in Tetrahedron Asymmetry, Vol.
3, p. 583 (1992). Asymmetric hydroformylation of vinyl
acetate using a rhodium complex containing this ligand has
been reported.On the other hand, carbapenem antibiotics have
recently undergone marked development, and preparation of 4-[(R)-1'-carboxyethyl]azetidin-2-one
derivatives represented
by formula (VIII): 

wherein R1 represents a hydrogen atom or a hydroxyl-protecting
group; and R2 represents a hydrogen atom or an
amino-protecting group,
which are important intermediates for carbapenem antibiotics
have been extensively studied.The carbapenem antibiotics
