<ABSTRACT>
Set formed of sandwich panels having a web (13) made of foam or the like protected by internal metal section pieces (9, 10) and external metal section pieces (11, 12), one of the fastening pieces (29) inserted in the joints between panels. The lower edges, on the outer side, have a projecting part (14) followed by a reentrant part (16) with a V-shaped cross-section, the two faces of which interact with the corresponding faces of a projecting part (18) of the upper edge of the adjacent panel. One of the faces of these Vs preferably parallel to the plane of the panels, thus effectively and in a leaktight manner, holding the panels in the event of horizontal stresses. The fastening pieces come into contact with the external section pieces in order to prevent them from moving away from the support.
