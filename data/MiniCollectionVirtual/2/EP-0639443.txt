<ABSTRACT>
A mold and method of forming a butterfly valve and 
the novel valve formed. In the method, a valve skeleton 

(200) having a body portion (202), a hollow neck (210) 
extending from the body portion to receive a valve stem 

and a cruciform-shaped actuator plate portion (212) on 
the hollow neck is suspended in a mold cavity (30) in 

inverted orientation, and reaction injection molding 
polymer is injected by laminar flow into the bottom of 

the mold cavity with an amount of polymer sufficient to 
fill the space from the bottom up, encapsulating the 

skeleton, and overfill the space to force the leading 
edge of the polymer out the top of said space into an 

escape chamber (188) to entrap residual gases into a 
severable offal member. The polymer encapsulates the 

cruciform-shaped actuator plate while filling the corner 
spaces (214) thereof, except for fastener orifices (311). 

A gate (138) at the bottom of the mold assures laminar 
flow of polymer into the mold cavity. The valve skeleton 

may have a plurality of radially extending mounting lug 
portions fitting into lug-receiving cavities (130') of 

the mold including at least one mounting lug-receiving 
cavity projecting radially outwardly and upwardly, the 

said mold cavity including an upwardly oriented flow 
passage (131) up from said at least one lug-receiving 

cavity to the polymer-receiving escape chamber (188), for 
flow of air from the at least one lug-receiving cavity 

through the flow passage to the escape chamber.

<DESCRIPTION>
Butterfly valves have for many years been 
manufactured by casting a rough valve body, machining the 
several required surfaces including the end faces, the 
valve seat where the disc engages and seals, the actuator 
flange face and fastener openings, and the stem bore. 
All of these must be highly accurate surfaces for proper 
smooth function and full closure of the valve. These 
machining operations are very costly and sometimes 
difficult to achieve, especially on large valves having 
a substantial weight. Consequently, the inventor herein, in efforts to 
lower the cost of the valve, and to improve its 
manufacturing ease, conceived of an injection molding 
technique for valve components as described in US-A-4 774 
750 and 4 777 977. That injection molding technique 
involved pressures in the general range of about 55,000 
to 69,000 kPa (about 8,000 to 10,000 pounds per square 
inch) and up. The earliest attempts in this regard 
resulted in the grey iron valve body breaking up under 
the pressures involved. Yet it is desirable to employ 
grey iron castings for cost reasons, if possible. Later 
attempts involved complex techniques in efforts to 
balance the pressures across certain surfaces of the 
valve body so as to not destroy the valve body under the 
tremendous injection molding pressures. Although it was 
found possible to do this for certain valve components, 
this advantage was not enough to instigate commercial use 
of the technique. The cost of molds for the injection 
process of these prior patents was high, being in the 
range of about US $70,000. Consequently, the older, 
standard manufacturing method involving several costly 
machining steps has largely prevailed. The present applicant has previously employed the  
 
technology set forth in US-A-4 740 347 to commercially 
produce certain components of butterfly valves. This 
involves injection molding of rubber around valve stem 
bearings after mounting them on a previously machined 
replica of the valve and stem, and placing them in the 
unmachined (or rough machined) opening in the valve 
housings. Still, whichever of these known commercial 
manufacturing processes was used, the cost of producing 
quality butterfly valves has been relatively high, with 
production requiring several complex operations. The present invention is set out in the independent 
claims while preferred features are set out in the 
dependent claims. Certain objects and advantages of 
preferred ways of putting the invention into practice 
will now be described but
