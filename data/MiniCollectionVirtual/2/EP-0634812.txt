<ABSTRACT>
This invention relates to a wire-connecting 
apparatus which comprises an insulating housing (10) and 

cover (12), and at least one terminal (14, 16) mounted in 
the housing wherein each terminal comprises a strip of 

electrically conductive sheet material having spaced 
terminal slit arrangements (34) formed therein. Each slit 

arrangement defines a plurality of tongues (40, 42) adapted 
to grip a wire or pin inserted between them. Wire-receiving 

holes (23) extend through the wall of the 
housing, and pin-receiving holes (30) extend through the 

cover with each wire and pin-receiving hole being in 
register with a terminal slit arrangement.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a wire-connecting 
apparatus for connecting one wire to another, or for making 
an electrical connection between an electronic component 
and a wire. The invention additionally extends to a 
terminal for use in such arrangements. Wire-connecting arrangements in the form of 
connector assemblies for electrically joining two wires or 
for connecting the pins of an electrical component to wires 
are known. These arrangements generally consist of a 
housing having a pair of electrical terminals electrically 
coupled to one another, and the wires and/or the component 
pins are connected to the terminals from outside of the 
housing. In many cases, the individual terminals of each 
pair are separate and are connected together on the inside 
of the housing by electrically conductive clips or wires, 
which are themselves soldered or screw-clamped to the 
individual terminals. In a number of arrangements, one or 
both terminals project outside the housing. Therefore, the 
soldering and screw-clamping of the wires and/or pins to 
the terminals, both on the inside and outside of the 
housing, not only add to the cost of manufacturing the 
assembly, but may result in dry soldered or poorly clamped 
electrically intermittent connections. Additionally, the 
exposed uninsulated portions of the terminals on the 
outside of the housing are electrically hazardous. Document EP-A-0 046 042 discloses a connector comprising push-in 
contact locations having two opposing contact portion, of which at least 
one is a spring tongue. Each spring tongue is sent out as a cantilever arm 
into the inside of the connector housing so that a conductor, which can be 
inserted into the connector in a single predetermined direction is engaged 
by the spring tongue at a small pitch angle.  
 A wire-connecting apparatus according to the 
invention comprises a connector assembly having a housing 
which is made from an electrically insulating material, a 
cover and at least one terminal mounted in the housing. 
Each terminal comprises a single strip of electrically 
conductive sheet metal material having two sets of spaced 
terminal slit arrangements which each define a plurality of 
tongues adapted to grip a wire or pin pressed between them. 
The housing and cover both include wire or pin-receiving 
holes, each hole being in register with a terminal slit 
arrangement. Each terminal is generally L-shaped and a 
terminal slit arrangement is located in each separate 
planar portion thereof. Preferably, the form defining

<CLAIMS>
A wire-connecting apparatus comprising: 

a dielectric base housing (10), and 
at least one electrically conductive terminal 
mounted within the housing, 
wherein each terminal includes a terminal strip 
having a plurality of spaced terminal slit arrangements 

(34) which each define a set of spaced tongues (40, 42) 
adapted to grip a wire inserted thereinto, and 
wherein the base housing includes a wire-receiving 
hole (23) in register with at least one of the 

terminal slit arrangements, 
 
characterized in that
 
   each terminal is generally L-shaped and one terminal slit arrangement is located in a separate planar portion of the terminal strip. 
A wire-connecting apparatus as set forth in 
claim 1 further comprising a cover (12) for mounting on the 

housing and including a pin-receiving hole (30) in register 
with at least one of the terminal slit arrangements. 
A wire-connecting apparatus as set forth in 
claim 1 or 2 wherein the base housing is generally box-shaped 

and includes integrally formed wall formations (26, 28) 
which locate and hold the terminals in position within the 

housing.  
 
A wire-connecting apparatus as set forth in 
claim 2 wherein the cover further comprises 


a terminal support structure on an inside surface 
thereof (31) for holding one of the planar portions of the 

terminal, and 
an inwardly extending ramp (46) within the area 
defined by the terminal support structure adjacent the pin-receiving 

hole (30) and against which the tongues (40, 42) 
of the at least one terminal slit arrangement bear to 

predispose the tongues out of the general plane of the 
terminal strip. 
A wire-connecting apparatus as set forth in 
claim 3 wherein an outer wall the base housing includes an 

outwardly extending wire-receiving socket (24) for guiding 
the wire into the wire-receiving hole (23) and into 

gripping engagement by the tongues of the terminal slit 
arrangement. 
An electrical terminal (14, 16) for use in 
a wire-connecting apparatus comprising:
 
   a terminal strip of electrically conductive sheet 

material including a plurality of spaced terminal slit 
arrangements (34) which each define a set of tongues (40, 

42) adapted to grip one of a wire and a pin inserted 
thereinto, characterized in that
 
   the terminal is generally L-shaped and one 

terminal slit arrangement is located in each separate 
planar portion of the terminal strip.  

 
An electrical terminal (14) as set forth in 
claim 6 wherein each terminal slit arrangement includes a 

first generally elongated slot (36) and a second slot (38) 
which extends generally perpendicular to the first slot and 

defines the wire-gripping tongues of the terminal.
