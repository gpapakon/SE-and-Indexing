<ABSTRACT>
A hand held, power driven planing tool (1) is 
fitted with at least one guide/guard member (2, 3). 

The guide/guard member (2, 3) comprises a first portion 
(5) which facilitates attachment to the planing tool 

(1) and a second portion (7) which is angled relative 
to the first portion. In use, a template defining the 

desired profile of a workpiece is attached to the side 
of an unworked workpiece and the said second portion of 

the guide/guard member is braced against the side of 
the workpiece. As the workpiece is worked by the 

planing tool the said second portion of the guide/guard 
member engages with and follows the template thereby 

ensuring that the profile of the finished workpiece 
exactly reproduces the shape of the template.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to power tools for 
shaping, shaving, chamfering, trimming and otherwise 
working on workpieces of wood and other similar 
materials. Such a power tool is disclosed and 
described in European Patent No. 0396582. More 
specifically, the present invention relates to a novel 
design of guide/guard member for use therewith. This 
guide/guard member is capable of following the shape of 
a template secured to a workpiece so as to reproduce 
the shape of the template in the surface of the 
workpiece. European Patent No. 0396582 discloses a hand held, 
power driven planing tool which comprises a rotatably 
driven cylindrical cutter block carrying one or more 
cutting blades mounted in a housing. The planing tool 
is supported, in use, against the surface of a 
workpiece by front and rear sole plates. These sole 
plates are spaced from each other to define an elongate 
slot therebetween through which the cutting blades 
extend to engage the surface of the workpiece as the 
cutter block is rotated. A guide/guard member is releasably secured to the 
housing at each end of the elongate slot defined 
between the front and rear sole plates. The position  
 
of each guide/guard member is adjustable to partially 
cover the elongate slot and thereby vary the effective 
length of the cutting blades which are exposed 
therethrough. In this way it is possible to ensure 
that no more of the cutting blades than is necessary to 
work the workpiece is exposed, thus minimising any risk 
of accidental contact with the cutting blades by the 
operator. The guide/guard members each take the form of an 
angled bracket one leg of which facilitates 
attachment to the planing tool and the other leg of 
which is shaped and curved around an axis angled 
relative to the longitudinal axis of the slot and 
contained in a plane perpendicular to the plane of the 
slot and passing through the longitudinal axis thereof. These curved and angled guide members allow a 
workpiece having a curved or straight edge to be 
accurately chamfered. However, they cannot be employed 
to quite the same effect in situations which require 
relatively complex profiles, including concave and 
convex curves, to be made in the surface of a 
workpiece. It is an object of the present invention to 
provide a guide/guard member for use with a power tool 
of the type disclosed and described in European Patent 
No. 0396582 which is capable of following a template 
secured to a workplate so as to ensure a perfect  
 
reproduction of the

<CLAIMS>
A guide/guard member for use with a hand held, 

power driven planing tool to shape and profile a workpiece,which 
guide member comprises a first portion (5) 

which facilitates attachment thereof to the planing 
tool and a second portion (7) which is angled relative 

to the said first portion (5) and which is intended, in 
use, to be braced against the side of a workpiece to be 

worked, characterised in that the bottom edge of the 
said second portion (7) defines a point contact which, 

in use, engages with and can follow the shaped edge of 
a template attached to the side of the workpiece 

against which the said second portion (7) is braced so 
as to ensure that the profile of the finished workpiece 

exactly reproduces the shape of the template. 
A guide/guard member according to Claim 1, 
characterised in that the bottom edge of said second 

portion (7) of the guide/guard member is curved to 
enable concave and convex curves in a template to be 

followed smoothly. 
A guide/guard member according to Claim 1, 
characterised in that the said second portion (7) takes 

the form of a relatively narrow and short spike, the 
point of which is intended, in use, to follow the 

shaped edge of a template. 
A guide/guard member according to any 
preceding Claim characterised in that a roller or ball 

bearing is carried by the guide/guard member at the 
intended point of contact with the shaped edge of a 

template. 
A guide/guard member according to any 
preceding Claim characterised in that the said 

second portion (7) defines a curved or V-shaped 
profile about an axis which lies in a plane angled 

relative to the said first portion (5) thereof. 
A guide/guard member according to any preceding 
Claim, characterised in that the length of the said 

second portion (7), that is to say the distance 
between the said first portion (5) and the bottom edge 

or point of contact of the second portion (7) with a 
template, is adjustable. 
A hand held, power driven planing tool (1) 
fitted with at least one guide/guard member (2, 3) 

according to any preceding Claim in combination with a 
template (9), the template (9) being attached, in use, 

to the side of a workpiece so as to facilitate 
profiling of the workpiece with the planing tool (1) 

to exactly reproduce the shape thereof.
