<ABSTRACT>
In a single wafer processing apparatus including a portable processing head that can 
be a portable module or a movable unit mounted to a supporting machine frame. The 

processing head has wafer support apparatus with grippers comprising movable fingers 
adapted to grip a wafer. The fingers protrude from a protective wafer plate and are 

mounted within a flexible diaphragm. Indexing and rotation monitoring assemblies are 
provided for automation of the wafer processing steps. A complementary processing 

base includes an upwardly-open bowl that receives a wafer held by the portable 
processing head. It has a full-diameter movable bottom wall for rapid draining 

purposes. Liquid and/or gas jets and nozzles supply fluids required within the bowl 
for processing wafers.

<DESCRIPTION>
The technical field of this invention relates to single wafer processors for 
holding, transporting and processing individual semiconductor wafers in conjunction 
with fluid treatment of at least one wafer surface. Chemical processing of semiconductor wafers and similar substrates is often 
carried out with respect to relatively large batches of wafers. Typically as many as 
twenty or thirty wafers are simultaneously immersed in a fluid (liquid or gas) or are 
subjected to fluid sprays. While this is highly effective for rinsing and drying of 
wafers, as well as for many conventional high volume manufacturing applications, it 
is of questionable economy where more expensive wafers or substrates are being 
processed, particularly during more complex or critical processing conditions. Such 
large-scale batch treatments of wafers multiply potential loss due to malfunction in the 
processing steps. Batch handling of wafers also interrupts the normal individualized 
handling and development of more expensive and exotic wafers or substrates. Individual handling and processing of wafers has also been increasingly dictated 
by the greater size of wafers coming into use today, as compared to earlier wafers. 
Where wafers once were 5 to 7.5 cm (2 or 3 in) in diameter, some are now as large 
as 20 cm (8 in) in diameter, and wafers having a diameter of 30 cm (12 in) are being 
used experimentally. This increase in size drastically increases the number of devices 
on each wafer, and correspondingly increases their potential value. Manufacturers can 
no longer economically risk the loss of such large numbers of devices to the many 
unpredictable variations encountered in batch processing operations. US-A-4788994 (Shinbara) discloses apparatus for surface treating a wafer, 
having a rotatable processing head allowing the wafer to be lowered into a treatment 
chamber and then raised out of it. The wafer is held above a wafer plate forming part 
of the processing head by upright, radially movable pillars or similar elements for 
holding the periphery of the wafer. It is an object of the invention to minimize the economic losses associated with 
use of prior processes.  According to one aspect of this invention, there is provided a single wafer 
processor, including a processing head which is centred about a first reference axis and 
includes: a wafer plate coaxially centred about the first reference axis at one axial end 
of the processing head, and having oppositely facing inner and outer surfaces; drive 
means
