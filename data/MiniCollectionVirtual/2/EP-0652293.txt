<ABSTRACT>
A method for the preparation of finely divided, dense 
packing, spherical shaped silver particles comprising the sequential steps of: 


(1) reacting an aqueous mixture of a silver salt with an alkanolamine to 
form a homogeneous aqueous solution of a dissolved silver alkanolamine 

complex; 
(2) preparing an aqueous solution of a reducing agent and, optionally, an 
alkanolamine; and 
(3) mixing together the silver alkanolamine complex solution and the 
reducing agent alkanolamine solution at a buffered pH and a 

temperature of 10°C to 100°C to form finely divided spherical 

silver particles.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention is directed to an improved process for making
finely divided silver particles. In particular, the invention is directed to a
process for making silver powders that are finely divided, dense packing
spheres.Silver powder is used in the electronics industry for the
manufacture of conductor thick film pastes. The thick film pastes are
screen printed onto substrates forming conductive circuit patterns. These
circuits are then dried and fired to volatilize the liquid organic vehicle and
sinter the silver particles.Printed circuit technology is requiring denser and more
precise electronic circuits. To meet these requirements, the conductive lines
have become more narrow in width with smaller distances between lines.
The silver powders necessary to form dense, closely packed, narrow lines
must be as close as possible to monosized, dense packing spheres.Many methods currently used to manufacture metal powders
can be applied to the production of silver powders. For example, thermal
decomposition processes, electrochemical processes. physical processes
such as atomization or milling, and chemical reduction methods can be 
used. Thermal decomposition processes tend to produce powders that are
spongy, agglomerated, and very porous whereas electrochemical processes
produce powders that are crystalline in shape and very large. Physical
processes are generally used to make flaked materials or very large
spherical particles. Chemical precipitation processes produce silver
powders with a range of sizes and shapes.Silver powders used in electronic applications are generally
manufactured using chemical precipitation processes. Silver powder is
produced by chemical reduction in which an aqueous solution of a soluble
salt of silver is reacted with an appropriate reducing agent under conditions
such that ionic silver is reduced and silver powder is precipitated. Inorganic
reducing agents including hydrazine, sulfite salts and formate salts produce
powders which are very coarse in size, are irregularly shaped and have a
large particle size distribution due to aggregation.Organic reducing agents such as alcohols, sugars or aldehydes
are used to reduce silver nitrate in the presence of a base such as alkali
hydroxides or carbonates. See Silver-Economics, Metallurgy and Use, A.
Butts, ed. 1975, Krieger Publishing Co., NY, p. 441. The reduction reaction
is very fast, hard to control and produces a powder contaminated with
residual alkali ions. Although small in size (e.g., <1 µm (micron)), these
powders tend to have
