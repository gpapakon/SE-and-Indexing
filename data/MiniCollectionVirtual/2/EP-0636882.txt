<ABSTRACT>
A detachable column cartridge for a gas chromatograph 
is disclosed. The cartridge column contains analytical 

and reference columns, a heater and a thermocouple, and 
connects via detachable connectors to a base unit 

containing an injector, a detector and other components 
normally found in gas chromatographs. The cartridge 

arrangement permits a substitute column to be connected to 
the base unit easily, in the field, when different gases 

are to be separated and analyzed. Also included are 
specific connectors for detachably connecting the columns 

with capillary tubes in the base unit of the gas 
chromatograph.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to gas chromatographs and in
particular to miniature gas chromatographs having a
capillary-type column and to connectors for such gas
chromatographs.More precisely the invention relates to a connector
as claimed in claim 1 and an arrangement for joining two capillary tubes
as claimedin claim 8.In recent years, semiconductor technology has created
the possibility of a miniature gas chromatograph. Such a
device is described in U.S. Patent No. 4,474,889, issued
to Terry et al., in which the channels for the carrier gas
and sample gas are etched in a semiconductor wafer. The
analytical column is external to these elements. U.S.
Patent No. 4,471,647, issued to Jerman et al., discloses a
miniature gas chromatograph in which all of the channels,
including the column, are etched on a semiconductor wafer.Functionally, a gas chromatograph can be divided into
elements which may be used repeatedly, for any tests, and
elements which may need to be changed, depending on the
gases to be detected. The former group includes the
injector and detector and their associated valves and
channels. On the other hand, the column may need to be 
changed in order to permit the gas chromatograph to
analyze a different gas or group of gases.The miniaturization of gas chromatographs has led to
the use of miniaturized capillary columns having internal
diameters generally in the range of 100-500 microns.
Exchanging a column having these dimensions is no trivial
task, and one that normally cannot be performed in the
field. Frequently, the chromatograph must be returned to
the manufacturer, who severs the connections to the
analytical and reference lines at the injector and
detector, replaces the column, and then reconnects the
column to the injector and the detector. Aligning the
tubes on either side of the connection is a delicate
operation, and connectors containing ferrules are often
used for this purpose. A mismatch or the introduction of
a "dead volume" in the connector can create eddy currents
and spatial voids which enhance Brownian diffusion,
ultimately interfering with the accuracy of the analysis.
This process can be time consuming and obviously requires
the chromatograph to be removed from service. It also
involves some expense and training.Several techniques for forming a connection between capillary tubes
are known. For example, International application WO-A-93/13415
describes a connector in which the capillary tube is fitted inside a
tubular metal insert, and an elastomeric gasket is fitted over the

A connector (91) for a capillary tube (118) comprising:

a fitting (112) having a tapered bore (112C) and an orifice
(112B) communicating with said tapered bore (112C), said orifice

(112B) being positioned on an axis of said fitting (112) and on a flat
surface (112A) perpendicular to said axis; and
a capillary tube (118) inserted into said tapered bore
(112C), an end of said capillary tube (118) abutting an interior

surface of said tapered bore (112C) and being spaced apart from said
orifice (112B) of said fitting (112), 
characterized in that
 said
tapered bore (112C) includes a portion having a diameter smaller than

an outside diamter of said capillary tube such that said capillary
tube does not extend to an end of said tapered bore.
The connector of claim 1 wherein said capillary tube (118)
is bonded to said fitting (112).
The connector of claim 1 or 2 wherein said orifice (112B)
has a diameter no greater than an outside diameter of said capillary

tube (118).
The connector of any preceding claim 1-3 wherein said
orifice (112B) has a diameter which is approximately equal to an

inside diameter of said capillary tube (118).
The connector of any preceding claim 1-4 wherein said flat
surface (112A) has a slight curvature.
The connector of any preceding claim 1-5 wherein said
tapered bore (112C) includes a first section tapered at a first angle

() and an second section tapered at a second angle (β).
