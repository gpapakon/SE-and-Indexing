Instrument for measuring the maximum quantity of flow
during expiration, comprising


a housing of two housing halves (12, 22) having an air
inlet opening (21) and at least one air outlet opening

(24) as well as a slot (14) extending in the
longitudinal direction of the housing and having a

display element (16) which can be moved along this slot
(14),
a rod (60) arranged in the housing extending from the
inlet opening (21) into the housing parallel to the

slot (14) and on which an impact plate (64) is slidably
mounted, which moves the display element (16) which can

be moved along the slot (14) in one direction by
slaving,
spring means (62) which are arranged between housing
and impact plate (64) and oppose the movement of the

impact plate (64) away from the inlet opening (21) with
a progressively increasing spring force, and
a receiver (30) for a mouthpiece attached to the
housing in the region of the air inlet opening (21),

characterised in that
the first housing half (12) has at least one projection
(18) which engages in a recess (24) in the second

housing half (22) when the housing is assembled,
the first (12) and the second housing half (22) have in
each case at least one extension (20, 26) which rest

against one another when the housing is assembled, and
the two extensions (20, 26) are held releasably against
one another when the housing is assembled by means of a 

retaining element (30) pushed thereover.
Instrument according to claim 1, characterised in that
the two extensions (20, 26) at their surface facing

outwards when the housing is assembled have in each case
at least one groove (70) and the grooves (70) are

provided in each case with at least one recess (72).
Instrument according to claim 1 or 2, characterised in
that the two extensions (20, 26) surround the air inlet

opening (21) when the housing is assembled.
Instrument according to claim 3, characterised in that
the receiver (30) for the mouthpiece (39) is designed as

a retaining element for holding the two extensions (20,

26) against one another.
Instrument according to claim 4, characterised in that
the receiver (30) for the mouthpiece (39) comprises a

hollow body, which has in each case an opening at the two
opposing end-faces, wherein the mouthpiece (39) is pushed

into the first opening (32) and the extensions (20, 26)
resting against one another of the two housing halves

(12, 22) are pushed into the second opening (34), and
which has two opposing openings (36) in the outer surface

which are arranged within depressions (38).
Instrument according to one of claims 4 or 5,
characterised in that the receiver (30) for the

mouthpiece (39) is locked releasably on the two
extensions (20, 26) using a securing element (40).
Instrument according to claim 6, characterised in that
the securing element (40) is designed like a clamp and

has on the two limbs (42, 44) bars (46) projecting
inwards which project beyond the ends of the limbs (42,

44) with noses (48) and on which is arranged in each case
at least one projection (50) protruding further inwards. 
Instrument according to claim 7, characterised in that
the clamp-like securing element (40) is pushed into the

depressions (38) on the outer surface of the retaining
element (30), wherein the bars (46) of the securing

element (40) are pushed through the openings (36) into
the depressions (38) of the outer surface into the

grooves (70) on the extensions (20, 26) of the two
housing halves (12, 22), the noses (48) at the ends of

the bars (46) engage the outer surface of the retaining
element (30) from the inside and the projections (50)

arranged on the bars (46) lock into the recesses (72) in
the grooves (70), so that a positive connection to be

released manually is formed between securing element
(40), retaining element (30) and extensions (20, 26).
Instrument according to one of the preceding claims,
characterised in that the at least one projection (18) on

the first housing half (12) is designed as a protruding
nose which engages in an air outlet opening (24) provided

in the second housing half (22) when the housing is
assembled.
Instrument according to one of the preceding claims,
characterised in that the spring means comprise a helical

extension spring (62) which is arranged around the rod
(60) arranged in the housing and has at one end a limb

directed into the interior of the helical spring (62) and
cutting the central axis of the helical spring (62),

which limb is firmly clamped by one end of the rod (60)
between the latter and a diffusor (19) arranged in the

air inlet opening (21), and the other end thereof is
screwed onto the impact plate (64).
Instrument according to claim 10, characterised in
that the impact plate (64) his a hollow journal (66)

standing vertically to the surface, through which the rod
(60) is pushed and is pushed onto one end of the helical

spring (62), as well as a bore passing vertically through
the impact plate (64) arranged next to the journal (66), 

on which bore starts a thread (68) arranged on the plate
surface passing once around the journal (66) and having a

pitch corresponding to the pitch of the helical spring
(62).
