Electromagnetic relay which exhibits the following 
features: 


an insulating base body (1; 201), 
at least one coil (23, 33; 223), disposed on the 
base body, with a core, 
a yoke (12; 212) connected to a first end of the 
core, 
an armature (13; 213) which is mounted on the yoke 
and which forms an air gap with the second end of 

the core, 
at least one contact spring (7, 8; 207), which is 
disposed between armature (13; 213) and coil (23, 

33; 223) and which is secured, in the vicinity of 
the armature bearing, to a holding pin (9, 10; 209) 

anchored in the base body and can be switched over, 
by its free end, by the armature between a normal 

position and an operated position, and 
at least one countercontact element (51, 52, 61; 
251, 261), which is anchored in the base body and 

which, in a specified switching position of the 
armature, closes a load current circuit with the 

contact spring, 
the holding pin (9; 209) being situated within the 
ferromagnetic circuit formed by yoke, armature and 

core and the countercontact element being situated, 
at least by a connecting portion, outside this 

ferromagnetic circuit, 
 
characterized in that a connecting pin (110; 210) for the 

contact spring (7; 207) is anchored in the base body (1; 
201) on that side of the armature (13; 213) or of the  

 
yoke (12; 212) which is opposite to the contact spring 

and is conductively connected to the contact spring via 
a hoop portion (111; 211) which engages over the armature 

or the yoke. 
Electromagnetic relay according to Claim 1, which 
exhibits: 


two separately drivable coils, disposed on the base 
body (1), with in each case one winding (23, 33) and 

in each case one core (14, 15) which are aligned 
substantially axially in relation to one another, an 

air gap being formed between the mutually facing 
inner ends of the core; 
a yoke (12) connecting the outer ends of the core, 
at least one armature (13) which is mounted on a 
centre region of the yoke (12) and which is disposed 

in the air gap between the inner ends of the core, 
at least two contact springs (7, 8) which are 
disposed in each case between armature (13) and coil 

and which are secured in the vicinity of the armature 
bearing and can be switched over by their free, 

contact-providing ends (72, 82) in each instance by 
the armature (13) between a normal position and an 

operated position, and 
at least two stationary countercontact elements (5, 
6) which are anchored in the base body and which 

provide contact in each instance at least with one 
contact spring (7, 8) in at least one of their 

switching positions, 
 
characterized in that the connecting pins (10, 110) of 

both contact springs (7, 8) are anchored in the base body 
(1) in the region between the armature (13) and the one 

coil (33), the one connecting pin (10) serving as holding 
pin for the one contact spring (8) and the other being 

conductively connected to the other contact spring (7) 
through a hoop portion (111) engaging over the armature 

(13). 
Relay according to one of Claims 1 or 2, 
characterized in that the holding pin (9) of the other  

 
contact spring (7) is additionally designed as connecting 

pin. 
Relay according to one of Claims 1 to 3, 
characterized in that a U-shaped connecting hoop (110, 

111, 9; 210, 211, 209) is secured, engaging over the 
armature (13; 213), by both ends in the base body (1; 

201), a first limb forming the connecting pin (110; 210) 
and a second limb forming a holding pin (9; 209) for the 

contact spring (7; 207). 
Relay according to Claim 4, characterized in that 
the U-shaped connecting hoop is secured in the base body 

in plug-in fashion.
