<CLAIMS>
A method for the treatment of foreign bodies
during the opening of bales, with the foreign

bodies in form of stones, strings, metal parts or
even foreign fibres, rags and packaging residues

or the like being determined, located and
automatically removed in the fibre bale or on the

fibre bale surface, characterized in that the
foreign bodies are removed after their recognition

by a removal unit (8) provided on the bale take-off
member (4).
A method as claimed in claim 1, characterized in
that the removal unit (8) is positioned and

lowered to the respective fibre bale surface
depending on the driving speed of the bale take-off

machine (1) over the fibre bales to be taken
off and on the position of a foreign body

recognition unit (7) with respect to the fibre
bale surface during the recognition of the foreign

body.
A method as claimed in claim 1 or 2, characterized
in that the bale take-off member (4) is lifted

after the recognition of the foreign body and and
is lowered again along the fibre bales (10 to 13)

depending on the driving speed of the bale take-off
machine (1) in order to pass by the foreign

body in a purposeful manner.
A method as claimed in claim 1 or 2, characterized
in that immediately after the recognition of a

foreign body the bale take-off machine (1) is
stopped, moved back, stopped again and is moved

with a predetermined driving speed in the normal
driving direction in order to position the removal 

unit (8) above the foreign body and to remove the foreign body.
A method as claimed in one of the preceding
claims, characterized in that the foreign body is

grasped from the fibre bale surface by means of a
gripper (24) and is transferred to a waste

container (25).
A method as claimed in one of the claims 1 to 4,
characterized in that the foreign body is sucked

off from the fibre bale surface by means of a
suction means (35) or a suction tube (41) and is

conveyed further by means of a suitable air stream
to a waste container (25).
An apparatus to perform the method as claimed in
claim 1, with a bale take-off member (4) and a

foreign body recognition unit (7) provided on the
bale take-off member for detecting foreign bodies

in the fibre bale or on the surface of the fibre
bale, and with a foreign body removal unit and a

computer control unit (21) which is connected with
the recognition unit (7) in order to cause an

automatic removal of a determined foreign body by
the removal unit (8), characterized by a foreign

body removal unit (8) provided on the bale take-off
member (4) for removing located foreign

bodies.
An apparatus as claimed in claim 7, characterized
in that the foreign body recognition unit (7) and

the foreign body removal unit (8) are provided on
the same side of the bale take-off member (4).
An apparatus as claimed in claim 7, characterized
in that the foreign body recognition unit (7) is 

provided on the one side of the bale take-off
is provided on the other side of the bale take-off

member (4).
An apparatus as claimed in one of the claims 7 to
9, characterized in that the foreign body removal

unit (8) is reciprocatably movable back and forth
and up and down on a carriage (26) transversally

to the direction of movement of the bale take-off
machine (1).
An apparatus as claimed in one of the claims 7 to
10, characterized in that the foreign body removal

unit (8) comprises a gripper (24).
An apparatus as claimed in one of the claims 7 to
10, characterized in that the foreign body removal

unit (8) comprises a suction means (35) or a
suction tube (41).
