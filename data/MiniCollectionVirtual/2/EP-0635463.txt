<ABSTRACT>
Additives for preventing the corrosion of metals in building materials containing an inorganic binder are described. These additives contain as corrosion inhibitor a reaction product of amines with acids or consist thereof. These salt-like corrosion inhibitors are low in odour and pleasant to process and can be used to improve, in a targeted manner, properties of the building material in processing or in use. In the corresponding methods for preventing the corrosion of metals which are in contact with the building materials, the corrosion inhibitors are preferably used in amounts of from 0.01 % by wt. to 10% by wt. based on the binder present in the building material. Also described are building materials which contain the corrosion inhibitors of the invention.

Use of a salt-like compound of amines and
acids as corrosion inhibitor in additives for inhibiting

the corrosion of metals in construction materials which
contain inorganic binders, characterised in that this additive

is added to the construction materials during the
production of the construction material, and in that the

salt-like compound during its use is not liberated into
the atmosphere.
Use according to claim 1, characterised in
that the amine component of the corrosion inhibitor is a

primary and/or secondary and/or tertiary amine in which
aliphatic and/or aromatic and/or cycloaliphatic residues

are bonded to the nitrogen atom or the nitrogen atom of
the amine component is a part of a heterocyclic structure

and in which one or more amino groups are present in the
amine component of the corrosion inhibitor.
Use according to claim 1 or 2, characterised
in that the amine component of the corrosion inhibitor

also includes in its molecule at least one hydroxy
group, preferred amino components comprising hydroxy

groups being those primary, secondary or tertiary aliphatic
amines which contain at least one alkanol amine

group per molecule.
Use according to one of claims 1 to 3,
characterised in that the amine component of the corrosion

inhibitor contains at least one amine which is selected
from the group which comprises the following

amines:

cyclohexylamine,
dicyclohexylamine,

as well as derivatives of the stated amines.
Use according to one of the claims 1 to 4,
characterised in that the acid component of the corrosion

inhibitor is a monobasic or polybasic inorganic or organic
acid, and that in the reaction product of the amine

and the acid there is present a stoichiometric ratio of
the two components or an excess of the amine component.
Use according to one of the claims 1 to 5,
characterised in that the acid component of the corrosion

inhibitor is selected from the group of those acids which
themselves have a corrosion inhibiting activity and/or a

concrete-fluidising action.
Use according to one of the claims 1 to 6,
characterised in that the acid component of the corrosion

inhibitor is such as to form with calcium ions low-solubility
or insoluble compounds and/or the acid component

of the corrosion inhibitor forms complexes or
chelates with calcium ions.
Use according to one of claims 1 to 7,
characterised in that the acid component of the corrosion

inhibitor is selected from the group of acids which comprises
the following monobasic or polybasic inorganic or

organic acids:
