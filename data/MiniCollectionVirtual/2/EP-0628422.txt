<ABSTRACT>
A printing sheet of the type which is used in a 
thermal transfer system, the printing sheet comprising a 

support and a dye receiving layer formed thereon, the dye 
receiving layer including a polymer containing isocyanate 

group, the polymer having polysiloxane unit and urea unit. 
The isocyanate group-containing polymer is selected from a 

reaction product between a multifunctional polyisocyanate 
compound and amino-modified silicone, or a reaction product 

between a multifunctional polyisocyanate compound and alcohol-modified 
silicone or carboxyl-modified silic
one and an amine 
compound or water. According to the present invention, both 

the writing characteristic and anti-sebaceous characteristic 
on an image surface are improved simultaneously while basic 

characteristics such as printing sheet sensitivity, image 
preservative stability, and so on, are satisfied.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention generally relates to printing
papers or sheets suitable for use in thermal transfer systems,
especially sublimation type thermal transfer systems and
manufacturing methods therefor. More particularly, the
present invention is directed to a printing paper or sheet
which has excellent anti-sebaceous characteristic as well as
excellent writing characteristic simultaneously, and a
manufacturing method therefor.There is widely used a thermal transfer recording
system in which an ink ribbon is heated through a thermal head
or by laser or the like in accordance with image information
to transfer a dye from the ink ribbon onto a printing sheet
through thermal melting, thermal diffusion or sublimation to
thereby form an image on the printing sheet. Particularly, in
recent years, a sublimation type thermal transfer recording
system receives a considerable attention, in which a thermal
dispersion dye such as a sublimation dye or the like is used
to form a full color image having continuous gradations. For
example, an attempt to heat an ink ribbon selectively in
accordance with an image signal of a video image to thereby
form an image on a video printing sheet has been made.As such a video printing sheet used is that which is
obtained by forming a dye receiving layer on a sheet-like 
support made of polypropylene or the like. The dye receiving
layer is a layer which receives a dye transferred thereto from
the ink ribbon by heating and preserves an image formed from
the dye. Examples of a resin heretofore used for constituting
the aforementioned dye receiving layer include materials which
can take dye well, for example, polyester, polycarbonate,
polyvinyl chloride, vinyl chloride copolymer such as vinyl
chloride-vinyl acetate copolymer, and thermoplastic resin such
as polyurethane resin, polystyrene, AS resin, ABS resin, etc.Further, in recent years, various attempts to
improve sensitivity to make the formation of a sharp image
possible and improve the weather resistance, light resistance
and thermal stability of the resulting image to preserve the
image stably have been made on the resin for constituting the
dye receiving layer. For example, in order to improve the
light resistance and weather resistance of the resulting
image, use of cellulose ester mainly as the resin for
constituting the dye receiving layer has been proposed (U.S.
Patent No.5,278,130).With the spread of thermal transfer recording
system, not only the sensitivity, and the weather resistance,
light resistance and thermal
