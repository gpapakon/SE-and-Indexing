<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to novel bispecific antibody fragments which
recognize lymphocyte CD2 antigen and any variable tumor antigen. Preferrably,
the antigenous determinant of the epidermal growth factor-receptor
(EGF-R) is used as tumor antigen. Moreover, the invention relates to two
new monoclonal antibodies termed AICD2.M1 and AICD2.M2, and a combined
positive effect of them on tumor lysis, whereby at least one of them is
a bispecfic antibody fragment. The antibodies and antibody fragments can be
used successfully in tumor therapy and diagnostics.T lymphocytes are probably the most efficient components of the immune
system when tumor cells are to be eliminated. However, most cancer
patients do not have significant numbers of cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTL)
specifically reactive to their tumor cells (e.g. Knuth et al. 1984, Proc. Natl.
Acad. Sci. (USA) 81, 3511). In order to activate the full lytic potential of
CTL all these cells have to be directed towards tumor cells for which they
have no natural specificity. T cells can be activated to proliferation, cytokine
secretion and cytolytic activity by binding of monoclonal antibodies to certain
membrane antigens on the surface of these cells.
Bispecific antibodies recognizing tumor-associated antigens with one
binding arm and T cell markers with the other one have been showed to
bridge monospecific CTL and malignant cells (e.g. Staerz et al. 1985, Nature
314, 628).
T cell activation by these artificial antibodies may occur through the T cell
receptor (TCR)/ CD3 complex, in which the TCR is responsible for the antigen
recognition and the CD3 epitope for the transduction of signals generated
by the TCR-antigen interaction ( e.g. see review article of H. Nelson,
Cancer Cells, May 1991, 163, and references cited herein).Effector cell activation may also occur via the CD2 antigen, a glycoprotein
which is present on T lymphocytes and natural killer (NK) cells (e.g. Hunig
et al. 1987, Nature 326, 298). CD2 supports the interaction of the effector
cell with the natural ligand LFA3 (CD58) on the target cell. Three functionally 
important epitopes (T11.1, T11.2 and T11.3) have been identified on
CD2. In contrast to the CD3 antigen which undergoes modulation upon
antibody binding there is no report sofare on CD2 modulation after targeting
of CD2 with antibody. Earlier work using anti-CD2 antibody for activation
has shown that a two-step activation via the CD2 antigen seems realistic.
