<ABSTRACT>
A process is provided for modifying a surface of a 
large area, non-planar substrate (
10
) to form micro structures 
(

process comprises forming the micro structures by reactive 

ion beam etching through a chosen pattern that has been 
prepared on the surface.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to the modification of
optical properties of a surface, and, more particularly, to
ion etching of the surface with chemically active ions.The optical properties of a surface can be modified by
fabricating micro structures into the surface. These
structures are useful in the fields of optical gratings,
crossed grating structures, and binary optics.Current etching technology for optical surfaces depends
upon the removal of material from the substrate by
kinetic bombardment. The kinetic energy of the incoming
ion, typically a noble gas such as argon, is transferred to
the substrate at the point of impact, causing substrate
molecules to break off.However, the prior art approach suffers from two disadvantages.
The first relates to the presence of accumulated
debris in the etched areas, and the second relates to
control of depth and shape of the etched areas.With regard to accumulated debris, the removed material
can fall back into the etched structures, like debris
falling into a meteor crater, or it can deposit onto the
sidewalls of etched grooves. This debris prevents the
etching of highly defined or deep structures that are vital
to tailoring the properties of an optical surfaces.With regard to control of depth and shape of the
etched areas, the kinetic energy of the ions by the prior
art process is varied by adjusting the anode voltage. However, 
this method of control does not have sufficient precision.DD-A-297 519 discloses a process according to the preamble of claim 1.EP-A-0 583 678 is part of the prior art under Article 54(3) EPC. It discloses the use of reactive ion beam etching for producing structure in a substrate. The photomask and the substrate are etched away at the same time.Thus, there remains a need for an etching process to
modify the surface for the formation of precision optical
gratings, crossed grating structures, and binary optics.In accordance with the invention, a process is provided
for modifying a surface substrate to form micro structures
therein that alter its optical properties. The process
comprises forming the micro structures by reactive ion
beam etching through a chosen pattern that has been prepared
on the surface.Reactive ion beam etching (RIBE) of optical surfaces
has two distinct advantages to the prior art methods.
First, RIBE enhances removal of debris. Because the reactive
ion undergoes a chemical reaction with the substrate,
the removed material can be in the form of a volatile gas
that is easily pumped away. Second, RIBE permits
