<CLAIMS>
Use of 1,4,5-triazine-2,4,6-tris-alkylaminocarboxylic
acid derivatives of the general formula



in which

n denotes a number in the range from 4 to 11 and
R
1
 has one of the following meanings:

a) an alkali metal atom or an ammonium ion derived
from an alkanolamine of the general formula



in which

at least one of the groups R
2
 denotes

aa)a hydroxyalkyl group having 2 to 4 carbon atoms,
bb)a hydroxyalkyl-oxyalkylene group having in each
case 2 to 4 carbon atoms in the hydroxyalkyl

and oxyalkylene radical or
cc)a dihydroxyalkyl group having 3 to 6 carbon
atoms

and, if less than two of the groups R
2
 have the
above meaning, the other group R
2
 is an alkyl group
having 1 to 6 carbon atoms or hyd
rogen, or
b) a radical of an alkanolamine of the general formula
II,

as biocidal and biostatic agents in aqueous systems.
Use according to Claim 1, characterized in that
n denotes the number 5. 
Use according to Claim 1 or 2, characterized in
that the amines of the general formula II are primary

alkanolamines or mixtures of primary and secondary
alkanolamines having 2 to 4 carbon atoms in the hydroxyalkyl

radicals.
Use according to at least one of Claims 1 to 3
together with water-soluble fungicides which are stable

to alkali.
Use according to at least one of Claims 1 to 4,
characterized in that pyrithione or derivatives thereof

and/or N-alkyl-diazenium dioxide salts are used as the
fungicide.
Use according to at least one of Claims 1 to 5,
characterized in that the aqueous systems are cooling

lubricants.
Use according to at least one of Claims 1 to 6,
characterized in that the aqueous system, based on the

total formulation, contains 0.05 to 0.40% by weight of
the 1,3,5-triazine-2,4,6-tris-alkylaminocarboxylic acid

derivatives of the general formula I and 0.0001 to 0.2%
by weight of fungicides.
