<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a hot melt adhesive 
and to a disposable article utilizing the adhesive. The 
invention more particularly relates to a disposable 
article such as a sanitary napkin, an incontinent pad, a 
bed pad, or a feminine pad. The adhesive of the invention 
is utilized as a positioning adhesive through which 
the napkin or pad is adhered to undergarments made of 
cotton, silk or man-made fibers such as nylon. The typical commercial disposable article 
adhesives use a plasticizing oil and a tackifying resin 
in combination with typically a styrene-ethylene/butylene-styrene 
(S-EB-S) or styrene-isoprene-styrene 
(S-I-S) linear (A-B-A) block or a multi-block (A-B-A-B-A-B) 
copolymer having a molecular weight less than about 
140,000. Such conventional commercial adhesives are 
typically formulated to generally contain greater than 
20 wt-% S-I-S or S-EB-S, A-B-A block copolymer or a 
multi-block (A-B-A-B-A-B) copolymer, generally 25 to 35 
wt-% with 40 to 60 wt-% tackifier and 25 to 35 wt-% oil. 
To date, amounts of block copolymer ranging from 20-35 
wt-% of the adhesive have been required to maintain 
adequate cohesive strength and adhesion properties in 
linear A-B-A block copolymer systems. The use of this 
amount of A-B-A rubber in these formulas result in high 
costs when compared to other adhesive systems. 
Additionally, such an adhesive with a high polymer 
content can result in a product viscosity that is in 
excess of the maximum viscosity useful for application 
temperatures lower than 176,6°C (350°F). It is desirable to apply 
positioning adhesives at temperatures lower than 176,6°C (350°F) 
for lower basis weight or heat sensitive substrates. To 
date, adhesives with a lower polymer level (i.e. about 
20 wt-%) and a viscosity in the applicable range have  
 
lost cohesive strength which results in adhesive 
transfer to the undergarment material, and produce 
unacceptably high peel strengths in the attachment mode. A different type of adhesive is disclosed in 
Doss et al, U.S. Pat. No. 3,993,613, which teaches an 
adhesive composition comprising about 10 parts by weight 
of a rubbery radial teleblock copolymer and a blended 
tackifier made by mixing a polyterpene, a polyvinyl 
aromatic or other tackifying resins with a polyalkylene 
tackifying copolymer. Additionally, Taylor et al, U.S. 
Pat. No. 4,212,910 teaches a PET bottle base adhesive 
having 20-40 percent by weight of a low molecular weight 
radial block polymer, 30-59% tackifier and 20-40% wax or 
oil. Collins et al, U.S.
