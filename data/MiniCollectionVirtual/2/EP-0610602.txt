<ABSTRACT>
A method and apparatus for displaying radiographic image(s) is 
disclosed. The image is decomposed into detail images at multiple 

resolution levels and a residual image, detail images are then 
modified and together with the residual images subjected to a 

reconstruction process wherein modified detail images are only taken 
into account up to a displayable resolution level.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention is in the field of digital radiography and
more specifically relates to processing and display of digital
radiographic images on a workstation.In the field of digital radiography a wide variety of image
acquisition techniques have been developed such as computerised
tomography, nuclear magnetic resonance, ultrasound, detection of a
radiation image by means of a CCD sensor or a video camera,
radiographic film scanning etc.In still another technique a radiation image, for example an
image of x-rays transmitted by an object, is stored in a screen
comprising a photostimulable phosphor such as one of the phosphors
described in European patent publication 503 702 published on
16.09.92 and US Ser. 07/842,603. The technique for reading out the
stored radiation image consists of scanning the screen with
stimulating radiation, such as laser light of the appropriate
wavelength, detecting the light emitted upon stimulation and
converting the emitted light into an electric representation for
example by means of a photomultiplier and digitizing the signal.The digital images obtained by one of the acquisition techniques
described hereinbefore can be stored on a graphic workstation for
retrieval at any time by an operator and for processing or re-processing
and display on a CRT screen or the like.The number of pixels in the digital radiographic image is
commonly far greater than the addressable number of pixels on the
display screen of the workstation.For example, in case of a digital radiographic image obtained by
read out of an exposed photostimulable phosphor plate, the number of
pixels in the digital image representation typically amounts to 2000
times 2500 pixels or even more whereas commercially available
display screens, for example CRT screens typically can display not
more than 1000 by 1200 pixels. The number of pixels in the digital
image representation is only indicative since the number of pixels 
in the pixel matrix may depend for example on the dimensions of the
photostimulable phosphor screen and may for some dimensions exceed
this number.In any case, if a radiographic image represented by a greater
number of pixels than the addressable number on the display device
is to be displayed, some sort of pixel number reduction has to be
performed.EP-A-0 146 728 (IBM) relates to image processing systems
including a plurality of input/output devices having different
resolutions.The system allows communication with input and output devices
having varying resolutions. It converts an image into

A method of displaying on a display device a radiographic
image represented as a digital signal comprising the steps of


decomposing the image representation into a sequence of detail
images at multiple resolution levels and a residual image,
storing said detail images and said residual image in a memory
device,
computing a processed image by applying a reconstruction
algorithm to the residual image and the detail
 images, the
reconstruction algorithm being such that if it were applied to

the residual image and all detail images without modification,
then said original image or a close approximation thereof would

be obtained, wherein retrieval of detail images is limited to
detail images up to a specific resolution level lower than the resolution of said radiographic image so that the

processed image after reconstruction has a resolution that is
equal to or smaller than the resolution of said display device,
displaying said reconstructed image,
characterised in that
pixel values of retrieved detail images are modified to yield
pixel values of a set of modified detail images by applying to

the pixel values of the retrieved detail images a non-linear
monotonically increasing odd mapping function with a slope that

gradually decreases with increasing argument value.
A method of displaying on a display device a number of
radiographic images by applying the method of claim 1 to said

resolution that is equal to or smaller than the resolution of

said display device.
A method according to claim 1 or 2 wherein the decomposed
image has a pyramidal structure such that the resolution level

of the detail images differs by a factor of 2, and the detail
images at each resolution level are calculated by filtering the 

original image with the difference of two low-pass filters and
by subsampling the resulting image by a factor 2.
A method according to claim 1 or 2 wherein said
