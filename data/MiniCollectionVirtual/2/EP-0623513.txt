<ABSTRACT>
A product packaging machine incorporates a pair of 
conveyor belts (30,30a) which are continuously driven in 

a given direction at a selected speed. The conveyor 
belts are mounted on a reciprocable frame (34,34a) and 

are arranged such that the product (P) being conveyed 
resides between the belts and a run of each belt firmly 

engages and transports the product. The belt runs 
engaging the product can be made to extend and retract in 

correspondence with the product being packaged reaching 
and completing a succeeding stage of packaging such as 

sealing.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to packaging machines and more 
particularly to a packaging machine such as a poultry 
packaging machine, having a conveyor belt system. 
A packaging machine as defined by the features indicated in the 
preamble of claim 1 is known from US-A-5 137 099. Conveyor belts are frequently used to transport items 
from one location to another. A conveyor belt when used 
as a conveying means normally has a fixed length or run 
extending between end rollers on which the belt travels 
and which are located at the beginning and end of travel 
of the belt. Thus, the conventional belt conveyor has an 
operative surface or run of fixed length. There are, however, operations requiring the use of a 
conveyor belt in which the length of the operative 
surface or run is required to change. An example of a 
conveyor belt extending between the beginning and the end 
of a conveyorized sealing process and in which the length 
of the operative run is required to periodically change 
during the course of moving items along a path is found 
in the reciprocable sealing bar section of an automatic 
film wrapping machine, such as that used to pack poultry 
for retail sale. As the speed of processing increases in  
 
such a variable length belt run system, the need to keep 
firm control of the product being packed also becomes 
increasingly important. In a widely used type of poultry 
packaging machine, a sheet of heat sealable film is 
formed into a tube around the product being packed. The 
tube is then cut and sealed along a line transverse to 
its centre line at a series of locations essentially 
between successive wrapped items. The cutting and 
sealing of the film is accomplished by a pair of heated 
sealing bars which converge onto the film tube and travel 
with the tube for a selected distance to permit a dwell 
time sufficient to adequately seal and cut the tube. The 
heated bars then separate and move backward to their 
starting position. Such a machine is disclosed in 
Japanese patent No. 63-33230 to Tadoru Suga for 
"Operation Control Apparatus of Seal Mechanism in 
Packaging Machine and Method Therefor". To allow the 
sealing bars to first move with and in the direction of 
the conveyor and then move back, there is disclosed in 
related Japanese patent application Serial No. 4-121,444, 
filed April 15, 1992, a conveyor having a moving gap on 
its product carrying surface which reciprocates to 
accommodate the reciprocating sealing bars. In order to maintain proper control of the product being 
wrap
