<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a catalyst according to the
preamble of Claim 1 for purifying diesel gases. The invention
also relates to a method for the manufacture of a catalyst and
to a method for purifying diesel exhaust gases.The exhaust gases of diesel engines contain nitrogen oxides,
carbon monoxide, and hydrocarbons. In addition, diesel exhaust
gas contains small amounts of SO2 gas, which in the operating
conditions of an exhaust gas catalyst tends to form, for example,
sulphates, which, when depositing on a surface containing
noble metals, will weaken the efficiency of the exhaust
gas catalyst. Other compounds which are detrimental for the
functioning of a catalyst are lead compounds and phosphorus
compounds.Sulphur dioxide gas in itself does not hamper the functioning
of a catalyst. However, in the exhaust gas catalysts in diesel
engines, sulphur dioxide gas tends to oxidize, whereby sulphur
trioxide is formed, and in a moist environment further
sulphate. This, in turn, results in the accumulation of sulphur
on the catalyst surface and a weakening of the catalytic
action. The accumulation of sulphur on the surface of the catalyst
is a serious problem in diesel exhaust gas catalysts.Patent publication US-5 000 929 discloses a catalyst in which
diesel exhaust gases are purified by using the oxides of palladium,
praseodymium, neodymium and samarium, and as a support
inorganic oxides. These inorganic oxides include active aluminum
oxide, silica, titanium dioxide, zirconium oxide, etc.,
mentioned in the patent. The operating conditions of the above-mentioned
catalyst are a high temperature and an oxidizing
atmosphere. EPO publication 0 377 290 discloses a catalyst which is silica-based
and removes impurities from diesel exhaust gases by oxidizing
carbon monoxide and hydrocarbons into carbon dioxide and
water. Both noble metals and promoters are added to the silica
support layer. The promoters include gold chloride, silver
nitrate, cerium chloride, etc. By means of the invention, the
oxidation of SO2 to SO3 is decreased to a rather low level.Patent publication WO-90/00439 discloses a method for lowering
the light-off temperature of diesel soot. On the surface of the
soot filter there is produced a support layer in which, for
example, titanium dioxide is used. The surface of the titanium
dioxide is impregnated with a noble metal, which may be Pt, Pd
or Rh. The light-off temperature of the soot was lowered by
means of such a filter.Patent publication EP-214 085 discloses a method for the production
