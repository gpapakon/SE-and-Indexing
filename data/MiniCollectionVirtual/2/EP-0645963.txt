<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to fungicidal and insecticidal active
compounds, compositions and derivatives thereof, and processes for producing such
compounds. The invention also relates to fungicidal and insecticidal compositions
comprising these compounds, either alone or in combination with other pesticides
or growth regulators, and the use of the compounds or compositions of the
invention for controlling fungi and/or insects.For a number of years it has been known that various microorganisms
produce secondary metabolites exhibiting biological activity so as to be useful as
pesticides for controlling diseases and pests.Although progress has been made in the field of identifying and
developing biological pesticides for controlling various diseases and pests in plants
and animals of agronomical and horticultural importance, most of the pesticides in
use are still synthetic compounds that are difficult to decompose in nature and have
a broad spectrum of activity.In the last decade or so there has been an increasing concern for the
impact of such pesticides on the environment and the ecosystems surrounding
farmlands, and consequently there exists an outspoken need for pesticides that are
more specific in their activity, and are readily degradable in the natural
environment.Natural products provide an alternative to synthetic fungicides and
insecticides in that they may have another mode of action, may be more
biodegradable and safer in the environment.Several compounds have been previously isolated from the genus
Pyrenophora. The Aspergillomarasamines, including Toxin A (below), are a series
of compounds derived from several genera of fungi including Pyrenophora. These 
compounds are toxic to higher plants and are widely distributed in fungi. (Physio.
Plant Path., Vol. 14, pp. 41-46, 1979).Another series of compounds isolated from a number of genera
including Pyrenophora are the Ophiobolins. A report of these phytotoxic and
antimicrobial compounds from P. teres has not previously been made. (Proc. Natl.
Acad. Sci. USA, Vol. 84, pp. 3081-3085, 1987). Pyrenolide compounds have been
isolated from P. teres. (Agric. Biol. Chem, Vol. 44, pp. 2761-2762, 1980). However,
their biological activity spectrum includes antifungal activity but no insecticidal
activity.Compounds reported from the genus Pyrenophora are the following:
It is, therefore, an object of the present invention to provide novel
fungicidal and insecticidal compounds which originate from natural sources or are
direct derivatives of such compounds
