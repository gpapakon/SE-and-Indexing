<ABSTRACT>
A method of forming an image in an electron microscope. Because of the 
oscillating behaviour of the phase contrast transfer function (PCTF), images made by 

means of an electron microscope are liable to exhibit contrast whereas the object does 
not exhibit such contrast. In order to counteract these deviations, it is proposed to form 

sub-images, each sub-image having its own defocusing of the imaging lens and each 
sub-image being formed with its own weighting factor, and to add said sub-images. A 

substantially flat variation of the PCTF is achieved by imparting an oscillating 
dependence as a function of the defocusing to the weighting factor. The invention offers 

a simple method of image reconstruction from the sub-images in that the value of the 
oscillating function has the same sign throughout the defocusing range. The desired 

image can then be obtained by addition of the sub-images on, for example a 
photographic film.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a method of forming an image of an object in a 
particle-optical instrument by way of a number of sub-images formed by means of an 
imaging lens system, which method comprises the formation of a number of successive 
sub-images, utilizing a different defocusing adjustment of the imaging lens system for 
each sub-image, the assignment of a weighting factor to each sub-image thus obtained, 
the of the weighting factor as a function of the defocusing being an oscillating function, 
and the addition of the sub-images multiplied by the weighting factors. The invention also relates to a particle-optical instrument for carrying out 
the method. A method of this kind is known from an article in the magazine "Journal 
of Electron Microscopy", Vol. 39, No. 3, 1990 pp. 137-144: "Active Image Processing 
as Applied to High Resolution Electron Microscopy (I) Assessment of Misalignment and 
Its Correction" by Y. Taniguchi et al. Methods of forming an image of an object in a particle-optical instrument 
by addition of a number of sub-images are known per se, for example from an article 
by P. Bonhomme and A. Beorchia: "Image synthesis in the electron microscope", 
Ultramicroscopy 17 (1985), pp. 127-132. The cited article, notably the caption of Fig. 
2, discloses a method of image reconstruction where an image is formed by addition of 
three series of sub-images. The first series thereof consists of a single image, whereas 
the second series consists of a continuous series of images for which the defocusing 
varies once in time from a lower limit to an upper limit due to linear variation in time 
of the excitation current of the lens, and the third series consists of a continuous series 
of images for which the defocusing also varies once in time from a lower limit to an 
upper limit, again due to a linearly varying lens current. The weighting factor assigned 
to the sub-images arises from the dwell time of the adjustment of the imaging lens 
system in a given defocus range. The cited article also describes the use of a lens  
 
current which varies sinusoidally in time. The cited publication by Bonhomme and Beorchia describes that this 
method enables the formation of images which transmit a wider range of the spatial 
frequencies present in the object in comparison with a conventional image for which the 
imaging lens has a fixed focus during the formation of the image. The image in a particle-optical instrument such as an electron microscope 
is customarily described by means of the
