<ABSTRACT>
The automatic firing unit according to the invention acts together with an electronic ignition unit (1). The latter has a distinctly lower nominal voltage of, for example, 120 volts than the mains voltage, for example 230 volts. The electronic ignition unit (1) is operated at the mains voltage, a power controller (2) which clocks the mains voltage at an adjustable sampling ratio being connected upstream of it, so that only some full-wave trains of the mains voltage are effective on the electronic ignition unit (1). In an advantageous refinement, the clock ratio is varied via the actual level of the mains voltage.

<CLAIMS>
An automatic firing arrangement having means for actuating
an incandescent igniter (1), by which the incandescent igniter (1)

can be heated up by means of mains voltage, wherein connected
upstream of the incandescent igniter (1) is a power adjusting means

(2), characterised in that the power adjusting means (2) cycles the
mains voltage with an adjustable pulse duty factor TV in such a way

that only individual whole full-wave trains of the mains voltage
become effective at the incandescent igniter (1).
An automatic firing arrangement according to claim 1
characterised in that the incandescent igniter (1) is designed for

operation at 120 volts, that the mains voltage is 230 volts
(-15/+10%) and the pulse duty factor TV of the power adjusting means

(2) is 1:4.
An automatic firing arrangement according to claim 2
characterised in that the pulse duty factor TV of 1:4 is produced by

a procedure whereby after the transmission of a full wave train of
the mains voltage the power adjusting means (2) subsequently blocks

three full wave trains of the mains voltage.
A automatic firing arrangement according to claim 1
characterised in that the power adjusting means (2) has a first input

(3) at which there is a signal corresponding to the design rated
voltage for operation of the incandescent igniter (1), that it has a

second input (5) at which there is a signal corresponding to the
mains voltage, and that the pulse duty factor TV of the power

adjusting means (2) is so varied in accordance with the relationship
of the design rated voltage and the mains voltage that the power loss

converted at the incandescent igniter (1) is approximately constant. 
An automatic firing arrangement according to claim 4
characterised in that the power adjusting means (2) determines the

pulse duty factor TV in accordance with the formula:

TV
 =

+0.5)

wherein U
ist
 is the mains voltage actual value.
An automatic firing arrangement according to claim 5
characterised in that the power adjusting means (2) has a first

operational amplifier (15), on whose non-inverting input acts the
charge state of a capacitor (17) whose charge state is influenced by

the magnitude of the mains voltage U
ist
 and on whose inverting input
acts a voltage divider comprising a Zener diode (11) and a resistor

(12), and that the power adjusting means (2) has a second operational
amplifier (22) which controls the production of trigger pulses for a

triac (31) immediately after the passage-through-zero of the mains
voltage U
ist

voltage U
ist
.
An automatic firing arrangement according to claim 6
characterised in that the operational amplifier (15, 22) has a push-pull

output.
An automatic firing arrangement according to claim 6 or
claim 7 characterised in that the operational amplifier (15, 22) and
