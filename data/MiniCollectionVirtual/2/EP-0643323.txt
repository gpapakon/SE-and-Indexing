<ABSTRACT>
A light-sensitive, zone focus, passive automatic focus/automatic exposure 
system for a zoom camera receives light level data and selects flash status, lens 

focus distance, and exposure setting such that flash illumination is provided at a 
light level greater than necessary to prevent underexposure but sufficient to 

provide fill-flash based only on the detected light level. A no-flash mode is 
provided in which exposure times are increased rather than activating the flash.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates generally to photographic zoom cameras and, more
particularly, to passive automatic focus/automatic exposure systems for cameras.Cameras that require no adjustments from users before taking photographs
are very inexpensive and easy to use, and therefore are quite popular with
consumers. These cameras often have a fixed lens focus distance, shutter speed,
and aperture diameter. For improved picture-taking with no loss in convenience,
consumers typically purchase flash-equipped cameras with variable focus, shutter,
and aperture mechanisms and automatic exposure and automatic focus systems.
Automatic exposure systems detect the amount of ambient light in the
photographic scene and adjust one or more exposure parameters such as shutter
speed, aperture opening, and flash setting to obtain optimal exposures for the
detected light level. Automatic focus systems typically include ranging systems
that determine the distance from the camera to a subject and automatically set
the focus of the camera objective lens in accordance with the determined
distance. Generally, the distance to the subject can be measured by a light- or
sound-emitting system, comprising an active system, or the distance can be
measured by the ambient light received from the photographic scene, comprising
a passive, split-image rangefinder system.Active ranging systems generally provide good accuracy, but require
relatively expensive components, including an emitter that produces a beam of
energy directed into a photographic scene, a beam receiver that detects the
reflected beam from a subject in the scene, and a control system that provides 
power to the emitter and processes information from the beam receiver to
determine the distance to the subject. These systems add cost and increase the
difficulty of packaging the camera components into a compact camera size.
Passive split-image rangefinder systems can require complex data manipulation
and correlation functions to make the calculations necessary to convert received
ambient light levels into object distances. Sophisticated cameras that provide
both automatic lens focus and exposure control features are very convenient to
use and provide good results, but can be rather complex and expensive. See, for
example, U.S. Patent No. 4,345,825 to Matteson and U.S. Patent No. 5,017,955 to
Kotani disclosing a camera in which a flash unit, a shutter/aperture combination exposure system and an autofocus system are automatically actuated by a controller including a data table
</DESCRIPTION>
<CLAIMS>
A zoom camera for taking photographs of a scene, the camera
comprising:


a variable focal length objective lens unit (12) with means for focus distance
adjustment;
means (24) for selecting, by a user, one of a limited number of predetermined
focal lengths of the objective lens;
a shutter/aperture combination (36) operable to provide a range of exposure
settings comprising shutter open times and aperture diameters to produce a photographic

exposure;
a light level detecting system (18) that receives ambient light from the scene and
produces a light signal representative of the amount of received light;
a flash unit (20) that provides flash illumination to the photographic scene;
a program table memory (38, 40) having data elements addressed by the selected
focal length and by a predetermined number of light level intervals of the light signal value,

each data element storing lens focus distance data, flash unit status on/off data, aperture
data, and shutter time data; and
a controller (32) that receives the detected light signal from the light level detecting
system (18) and, based on the light level interval of the light signal value and the selected focal

length, selects lens focus distance data, shutter time data, aperture data and flash unit status
on/off data from the program table memory and, based on the selected data from the

program table memory, controls the corresponding camera settings, wherein the program
table memory is such that the flash unit status is changed from off to on at a predetermined

light signal value different from the value at which the lens focus distance is changed.
The zoom camera as defined in claim 1, wherein the program table
memory contains data elements such that only one predetermined shutter time is possible for

each aperture selected from the table memory.
The zoom camera as defined in claim 1, wherein the camera further
comprises a manual flash selector (22) switch that can be switched in a non-flash setting such 

that the controller increases the shutter time for data elements that otherwise would have a
flash unit status data from the memory table with an on setting.
The zoom camera as defined in claim 1, wherein the shutter/aperture
combination (36) comprises a separate shutter mechanism and aperture mechanism.
The zoom camera as defined in claims 1, 2 or 4, wherein the controller
controls the shutter/aperture combination such that the shutter aperture diameter is selected

from a predetermined number of diameters.
The zoom camera as defined in claim 5, wherein the shutter aperture
diameters comprise four predetermined diameters.
The zoom camera as defined in claim 5, wherein the controller controls
the shutter/aperture combination such that the controller selects only one predetermined

shutter time for each aperture diameter regardless of changes in light level.
