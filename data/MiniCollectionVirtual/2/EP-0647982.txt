<ABSTRACT>
An antenna for a base station comprising a plurality of antenna arrays 
(40; Fig. 6a) each capable of forming a multiplicity of separate 

overlapping narrow beams in azimuth, the arrays being positioned 
such that the beams formed by the arrays provide a coverage in 

azimuth wider than each array. Means are provided for operating (Fig. 
12a, Fig. 12b) two or more non-collocated narrow beamwidth antenna 

arrays to form jointly a broad beamwidth antenna radiation pattern 
wherein the time averaged antenna pattern is substantially null free.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a base station antenna arrangement, for use
in a Cellular Radio communications system.Cellular radio systems are currently increasing in use throughout the
world providing telecommunications to mobile users. In order to meet
the capacity demand, within the available frequency band allocation,
cellular radio systems divide a geographic area to be covered into
cells. At the centre of each cell is a base station, through which the
mobile stations communicate. The available communication channels
are divided between the cells such that the same group of channels
are reused by certain cells. The distance between the reused cells is
planned such that the co-channel interference is maintained at a
tolerable level.When a new cellular radio system is initially deployed, operators are
often interested in maximising the uplink (mobile station to base
station) and downlink (base station to mobile station) range. The
ranges in many systems are uplink limited due to the relatively low
transmitted power levels of hand portable mobile stations. Any
increase in range means that less cells are required to cover a given
geographic area, hence reducing the number of base stations and
associated infrastructure costs.When a cellular radio system is mature the capacity demand can often
increase, especially in cities, to a point where more, smaller size cells
are needed in order to meet the required capacity per unit area. The
process used to create these smaller cells is known as celt splitting.
Any technique that can provide additional capacity without the need for 
cell-splitting will again reduce the number of base station sites and
associated infrastructure costs.The antenna used at the base station site can potentially make
significant improvements to the range and capacity of a cellular radio
system. The ideal base station antenna pattern is a beam of narrow
angular width as shown in Fig 1a. The narrow beam is directed at the
wanted mobile, is narrow in both the azimuth and elevation planes, and
tracks the mobile's movements. When compared to an omni-directional
antenna, such a beam will have the dual benefits of having high gain,
leading to increased range in thermal noise limited initial deployments,
and rejecting interference from co-channel reuse cells allowing higher
capacity without cell splitting in mature deployments. The narrow beam
reduces interference in a balanced manner on the uplink and downlink.
On the uplink the base station receiver is protected from interference
generated by
