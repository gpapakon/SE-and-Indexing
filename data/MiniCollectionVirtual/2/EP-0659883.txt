<ABSTRACT>
The present invention is related to a novel protein p140 
polypeptide which is a key protein involved in the signal transmission 

system of insulin; method for preparation of it; DNA encoding the said 
polypeptide; vector derived the said DNA; host cells transformed the said 

vector; antibody of the said polypeptide; pharmaceutical composition 
containing the said peptide or antibody; method for the prevention and/or 

treatment of diabetes, which is characterized by tyrosine phosphorylation 
of the said protein p140; agent for the prevention and/or treatment for the 

currently said the prevention and/or treatment method; agent for the 
prevention and/or treatment of diabetes, which is characterized by 

containing a compound which can tyrosine phosphorylation of protein 
p140, as active ingredient and the screening methods of the said 

prevention and/or treatment agent. 
Tyrosine phosphorylation of protein p140 is an essential step in the 
induction of hypoglycemia by glucose uptake. Method and agent of 

prevention and/or treatment based on tyrosine phosphorylation of protein 
p140 in the present invention is not only improve the diabetes-derived 

hyperglycemic conditions but are also useful for the treatment and/or 
prevention of diabetes, especially non-insulin dependent diabetes 

mellitus (NIDDM).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention is related to a novel protein p140
polypeptide which is a key protein involved in the signal transmission
system of insulin; method for preparation of it; DNA encoding the said
polypeptide; vector derived the said DNA; host cells transformed the said
vector; antibody of the said polypeptide; pharmaceutical composition
containing the said peptide or antibody;
agent for the prevention and/or treatment of diabetes, which is
characterized by containing said polypeptide
and the screening
methods of the said prevention and/or treatment agent.Diabetes, an abnormal metabolic disease, is induced by a defect in
the mechanism of glucose metabolism.Under normal conditions, glucose metabolism occurs as follows:
Carbohydrates, consumed in the form of food, are digested to glucose in
the intestines prior to absorption into the circulatory system. Pancreatic β
cells respond to an increase in the blood glucose level by secreting
insulin, which in turn stimulates the target peripheral tissues (muscles and 
liver) to decrease the blood glucose level by enhancing tissue absorption
of the blood glucose followed by conversion to glycogen for storage.Depending on the causative factors, diabetes is classified into two
major categories; insulin dependent diabetes mellitus (IDDM) and non-insulin
dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM). IDDM (Type I diabetes) is a
pathological condition where insulin is not secreted or insufficient even on
secretion by pancreatic β cells responding to an increase in the blood
glucose level induced by food consumption. It has been known that
destruction of β cells of the pancreatic islets induces IDDM. The current
therapy employs supplementation of insulin from exogenous sources.NIDDM (Type II diabetes) is a pathological condition where the
feedback mechanism of peripheral tissues is dysfunctional and is
ineffective in decreasing the blood glucose level although normal insulin
secretion occurs within the living system. In the United States of America,
NIDDM is said to be a common disease; 5% of the population exceeding
40 years of age suffer from NIDDM. Causative factors involved in this
disease have yet to be elucidated.Elucidation of the etiology of NIDDM; namely, clarification of the
insulin-induced glucose uptake mechanism in peripheral tissue cells is,
however, unclear as current knowledge on information transmission
mechanism of insulin remains limited and unestablished.Insulin secreted from the pancreatic islets binds with insulin
receptors on the cell membrane of
