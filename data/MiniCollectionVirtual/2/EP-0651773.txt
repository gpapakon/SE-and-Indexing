<ABSTRACT>
The invention describes directly formable solutions prepared in an anhydrous dimethylalkylene urea, based on a polyimide obtained from an aromatic dianhydride and an aromatic diisocyanate. The method of obtaining said solutions, a method of spinning said solutions, and the yarns and fibres thus obtained are also described.
