<ABSTRACT>
The craft according to the present invention consists of a structure corresponding to the one of the inflatable tubulars of the known rubber dinghies, preferably realized of polyester reinforced with glass fibre, externally showing a shape (1) cylindrical or similar and provided, in the internal part, with re-entrant spaces (4) that considerably increase the internal space of said craft so that, maintaining the typical shape of the rubber dinghies, the craft according to the present invention shows a greater structural stiffness and mechanical resistance.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention concerns a craft with rigid
tubulars, having watertight, non-communicating
compartments, a high hydrodynamic efficiency and
comprising internal spaces enlarged with respect to the
known rubber dinghies.Said rubber dinghies, beyond their great advantages of
manoeuvrability and transportability, have also a few
disadvantages:
they are subject to puncturing, which determines their
most serious damage;they request a rather long time for inflating;during movement and in particular situations, they may
get deformed in the impact with the waves, with a
consequent increase of the friction and loss of speed
and seaworthiness;they prevent, due to the cylindrical structure of
their edges and to the material they are of, to place
seats or similar.A rigid craft has been disclosed in FR-A-2 578 220.It is the aim of the present invention to realize a
craft that maintains the positive features of a rubber
dinghy without its disadvantages. The aim set forth is reached by means of the craft
according to the present invention, consisting of a
structure corresponding to the one of the inflatable
tubulars of the rubber dinghies, realized with different
kinds of rigid materials, like polyester reinforced with
glass fibre, having externally a cylindrical shape or
similar, and internally being provided with cavities
that increase the internal space so that, maintaining
the shape typical for rubber dinghies, the object
according to the present invention shows a structural
stiffness and a mechanical resistance.Still according to the present invention, it is provided
that the craft be provided on deck with infrastructures
for realizing cabins and/or protections from atmospheric
agents; to this purpose, a greater space inside the
craft offers great advantages.The advantages of the craft according to the present
invention consist of a greater internal space, the lack
of maintenance, resistance to ageing and puncturing, a
petrol consumption reduced than with rubber dinghies,
greater safety on sea with respect to all conventional
crafts. The present invention will be described more in detail
hereinbelow relating to the enclosed drawings in which
some preferred embodiments are shown.Figure 1 shows a plant scheme of a craft according to
the present invention, with rigid tubulars, having
watertight, non-communicating compartments, provided
for the lower hull as well as for the deck.Figures 2, 3 and 4 respectively show a square section, a
lateral view and details of a craft obtained by coupling
a hull F and a deck
</DESCRIPTION>
<CLAIMS>
A craft with rigid tubulars, having watertight, non-communicating
compartments, and a high hydrodynamic efficiency, comprising:


increased internal spaces with respect to inflatable rubber dinghies;
tubular hulls (1) of metal, plastic material or polyester reinforced with
glass fibre, or any rigid material, provided with a floating capacity

similar to the one of the inflatable crafts, but being rigid and not
deformable during movement;
a plurality of diaphragms (2) for the separation into
transversal compartments of the internal volume of hulls (1), into

noncommunicating, watertight chambers (3) for the anti-sinking safety;
re-entrant perimetral internal shapes 84) of the tubulars (1),
for increasing the internal useful volume,

characterized by:

longitudinal diaphragms in the hulls, a plurality of
lateral backs pliable onto hinges applied onto the

upper edges of the rigid tubulars and by longitudinal
keel-like tubular bottoms joined up with the central

V-shaped keel by means of surfaces with convex sections. 
A craft according to claim 1, characterized in that it
is realized by coupling the rigid hull (F) and the rigid

deck (C). 
A craft according to the precedent claims, characterized
in a series of separate, watertight chambers, muc
h
closer in the lower part - the hull (F) - than in the

deck (C), for increasing the unsinkability, should the
craft dash againts a rock.
A craft according to claim 1, characterized in tubulars
(1) filled up with closed-cells foams.
A craft according to claim 1, characterized in a driving
consolle (7) placed in a central position, with lateral

areas (8) for walking, also in crafts of very small
dimensions.
A craft according to claim 1, characterized in tubulars
(1) with a lower keel-structure (9).
A craft according to claim 1, characterized in built-in
or disappearing seats in the rigid structure of tubulars

(1).
