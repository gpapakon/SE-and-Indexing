<ABSTRACT>
A container (1) for transporting and storing, in particular, flammable and non-flammable liquids which are a hazard to water in cubic tank containers and large packaging means in the form of a container has a fluid-tight bottom trough (10) which is covered by a bottom grid (15) and is provided with two closable ventilation openings which are arranged, in particular, opposite each other at the end face. The container (1) is an exchangeable container made of non-flammable material and designed in the manner of a suitcase with a centring tunnel and four supporting legs (20) which can be folded in. The bottom trough (10) has a bottom plate (11) which is profiled in the longitudinal direction. Two lateral longitudinal supports (12) and two end-face transverse supports (13) are integral constituents of the bottom trough (10). The other transverse supports (14) are arranged extending solely within the bottom trough (11) between the longitudinal supports (12) and are connected to the latter. The centring tunnel is formed by two guide profiles (16) which are spaced apart and are mounted outside the bottom trough (10). The bottom trough (10) thus formed also constitutes the bearing understructure of the container (1). This results in an extremely flat construction of the understructure, such that the dual function of storing and transporting can be implemented in an exchangeable container designed in the manner of a suitcase with a centring tunnel.

Receptacle for transporting and storing, in 
particular, flammable and nonflammable water-endangering 

liquids in cubic tank containers and large-scale 
packaging means, and also vats, canisters, barrels and 

other transportable vessels, in the form of a container 
having a liquid-tight base trough which is covered by a 

base grating and also two closable ventilation openings 
which are oppositely arranged, in particular at the end 

faces, characterized in that 

the receptacle (1) is an exchangable receptacle made 
of nonflammable material in a trunk-type construction 

having centring tunnel and four retractable 
supporting legs (20), 
the base trough (10) has a base plate (11) profiled 
in the longitudinal direction, 
two lateral longitudinal beams (12) and two end-face 
transverse beams (13) are integral components of the 

base trough (10), 
a plurality of transverse beams (14) are arranged 
exclusively within the base trough (11) running 

between the longitudinal beams (12) and are joined 
to the latter, and 
the centring tunnel is formed by two guide sections 
(16) which extend continuously in the longitudinal 

direction at a distance outside the base trough (10) 
and are joined to the base plate (11). 
Receptacle according to Claim 1, characterized in 
that the transverse beams (14) arranged inside the base  

 
trough (10) are welded or glued to the base plate (11). 
Receptacle according to Claim 1 or 2, characterized 
in that the base trough (10) has, in particular in the 

end regions of the lateral longitudinal beams (12), an 
inwardly receding, box-like contour shape for the 

outwardly flush reception of the supporting legs (20) in 
the retracted state. 
Receptacle according to Claim 3, characterized in 
that supporting bearings (21) are provided in each case 

for the supporting legs (20) in the region of the receding 
contour shape, which supporting bearings are attached 

to the transverse beams (14) which are arranged inside 
the base trough (10) with the insertion of the base plate 

(11). 
Receptacle according to one of the preceding claims, 
characterized in that the base grating in the form of a 

multiple arrangement of individual bar gratings (15) 
rests directly on the transverse beams (14) extending 

inside the base trough (10)and can be transported by a 
fork lift stacker or a manual fork lift truck. 
Receptacle according to one of the preceding claims, 
characterized in that at least the base plate (11), the 

longitudinal beams (12) and the transverse beams (13, 14) 
are composed of a material which is resistant to the 

liquids to be transported and stored. 
Receptacle according to Claim 6, characterized in  
 

that the resistant material is high-grade steel. 
Receptacle according to one of Claims 1 to 5, 
characterized in that the base trough (10) is completely 

coated on the inside with a material which is resistant 
to the liquids to be transported and stored. 
Receptacle according to one of the preceding claims, 
characterized in that the base trough (10) has a closable 

drainage opening. 
Receptacle according to Claim 9, characterized in 
that a viewing window is provided immediately adjacent to 

the closable drainage opening in the base trough (10). 
Receptacle according to Claim 9 or 10, characterized 
in that the closable drainage opening and the viewing 

window also present are provided on a portion of the 
longitudinal beam (12) which extends in a set-back 

manner.
