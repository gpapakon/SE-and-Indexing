<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a recording and/or reproducing apparatus
arranged to process, record and/or reproduce images and
sounds.Document EP 0 390 421 A1 discloses a still video camera wherein
a solid-state memory device is used as an image recording medium
wherein photographed images generated by a photographic lens are
recorded. For recording a large amount of image information in a
less memory capacity, a plurality of data compressing means including
a non-compression one are provided, and wherein the control
concept of the still video camera is such that in accordance
with image data one of the plurality of compression means
can be selected to use a proper one of the compression processes
according to the image data to obtain an optimal data compression.
Before the data of the images are compressed the data are
evaluated by an analog-to-digital conversion. In addition, the
memory means can also be used for storing programs for compression
and can be provided as an element attachable to and detachable
from the camera body. Accordingly, by means of the data or
programs included in this memory the data available in the camera
as well as the program for compression can be modified when
the memory is attached to the camera body and the program for
compression written in the memory is transferred to the camera
body and used therein. Furthermore, Fig. 8 shows in a block diagram a conventional
digital electronic camera. Referring to Fig. 8, the
digital electronic camera 800 is arranged to use a memory
card 801 as a recording medium. The camera 800 includes a
photo-taking lens 1, a diaphragm shutter 2 which is a
shutter, but functions as a diaphragm as well, and a flash
device 3. A CPU 4 is arranged to control mechanical and
operation parts. A driving circuit 5 is arranged to drive
each part of a mechanical system. An image sensor 6 is
arranged to convert into an electrical signal a reflection
light which comes from an object of shooting. A timing
signal generating circuit (abbreviated to a TG circuit) 7
is arranged to generate a timing signal necessary for
operating the image sensor 6. An image sensor driving
circuit 8 is arranged to amplify the timing signal from
the timing signal generating circuit 7 up to a level
necessary for driving the image sensor 6. A preprocessing
circuit 9 is provided with a CDS circuit for removing a
noise from the output of the image sensor 6 and a
nonlinear type amplifying circuit for amplifying the
output of the image sensor 6 prior to an A/D (analog-to-digital) 
conversion
