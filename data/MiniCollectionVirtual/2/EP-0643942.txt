<ABSTRACT>
A system and a method for monitoring concentrations of 
ammonium, and urease, during short or prolonged periods is 

presented, as an indicator of the presence and activity of 
a Helicobacter Pylori ("HP") infection, and of other 

bacterial infections that are similar. Ambulatory 
monitoring is possible. This system and method may be used 

in the evaluation of treatments for HP and other bacterial 
infection in the patient. A method is also presented to 

increase the diagnostic accuracy of the system and method 
by ingesting urea immediately before or during the 

monitoring.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention involves a system and a method for 
the measurement, which may be continous on a stationary or 
ambulatory basis, of various internal factors of a human 
patient. Specifically the invention, according to one 
embodiment, monitors the concentration of ammonium and of 
urease in the gastrointestinal tract of the patient. 
Specifically and according to other embodiments of the 
invention the invention monitors the concentration of e.g. 
ammonium and urease in the saliva and/or in the urine of 
the patient. More specifically, this data is used as an 
indicator of the presence of bacteria and especially 
Helicobacter Pylori ("HP") infection in the patient, as 
well as of the effectiveness of treatment for a bacterial 
infection, and especially an HP infection. The system may 
also be used for in vivo monitoring of ammonium producing 
bacteria in the colon and other parts of the gastrointestinal 
tract and for in vitro monitoring of ammonium 
producing bacteria in the patient. A method is also shown 
to increase the accuracy of the present invention by 
ingestion of urea by the patient prior to use. HP is a recently discovered bacteria increasingly being 
recognized as an etiologic agent for a variety of upper 
gastrointestinal diseases (see Kim et al., in the American 
Journal of Clinical Pathology, 1990, volume 94, pages 187 
ghrough 191) including gastritis, ulcers, cancer, and 
associated disorders. In the case of an infection, HP may 
be identified in the mucus layer. In the case of a stomach 
infection, HP produces a urease enzyme and influences the 
ammonium levels in the gastrointestinal tract of the 
patient. It has recently been discovered that an ammonium electrode  
 
can be used to identicate the presence of HP bacteria in 
gastric tissue. (See Butcher, et al., in Digestion, 1992, 
volume 53, pages 142 through 148). However, this discovery 
was of the use of such an electrode on in vitro (cell 
cultures in a laboratory) and not in vivo (in a living 
patient). Biopsies were required, and information was 
obtained only for the condition present at the time that 
the biopsy was obtained. No in patient, continous, real 
time, ambulatory monitoring was indicated, nor was the 
possibility of combining such measurements, with 
simultaneous measurement of other related parameters. 
Furthermore, it has not been thought of the possibility of 
measuring in vivo in the mouth and/or in the bladder or in 
vitro in saliva or urine samples of the patient. Diagnosis and monitoring of an HP
