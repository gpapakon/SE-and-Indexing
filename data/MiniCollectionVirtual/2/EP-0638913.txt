<ABSTRACT>
The circuit according to the invention makes it possible to detect and to identify the position of several contactors. Each contactor (1) is mounted in series with a resistor (2). The first contacts (AN) are connected together. It is the same for the second contacts (BN) and the third points (CN) of the branches thus constituted. Furthermore, the third points (CN) are separated by a second resistor (6). Measurement of the voltage between the first and third points (A, C) makes it possible to detect and to identify the open and closed contactors. It makes it possible furthermore to detect a breakdown. Application to detecting the position of the doors of a turbine jet engine thrust reverser.

<CLAIMS>
Circuit for detecting the position of several 
two-pole contactors (1) on a first contact (A
N
) and a 
second contact (B
N
), characterized in that: 

the contactors (1) are mounted in parallel; 
a first resistor (2) of defined value is mounted in 
series with each contactor (1); 
a voltage supply (3) is connected between a first 
point (A) connected to all the first contacts (A
N
) 
and a second point (B) connected to the second 

contacts (B
N
); 
an analog/digital converter (4) is connected between 
the first point (A) and the third point (C), supplying 

a measurement signal; 
a signal processing means (5) is connected to the 
output of the analog/digital converter (4). 
Detection circuit according to Claim 1, characterized 
in that a second resistor (6) of defined value is 

interposed between each of the branches consisting of a 
contactor (1) and of a first series-mounted resistor (2). 
Circuit according to Claim 2, characterized in 
that the first resistors (2) have a defined value equal 

to 2R, the second resistors (6) having a defined value 
equal to half, that is to say R. 
Circuit according to Claim 1, characterized in 
that a third resistor (7) of defined value is placed 

between the two contacts (A
N
, B
N
) of each contactor (11). 
Circuit according to Claim 4, characterized in 
that the first resistors (2) and the third resistors (7) 

have the same value, R. 
Device for detecting the position of the doors of  
 

a thrust reverser of a jet engine, using a circuit 
according to one of the preceding claims, the movable 

part (L) of each contactor (1) being linked to the door 
of a reverser, in such a way that the two positions of 

the contactors (1) are characteristic of the open and 
closed positions of the doors.
