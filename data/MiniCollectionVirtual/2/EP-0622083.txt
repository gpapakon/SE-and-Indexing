<ABSTRACT>
(A) A clad powdery or granular preparation of a 
medicinally active ingredient and (B) a powdery or 

granular ion exchanger such as a cation exchange resin 
are blended to prepare a solid preparation. The active 

ingredient includes β-lactam antibiotics having a basic 
group. The clad powdery or granular preparation includes 

not only coated preparation wherein the active 
ingredient or preparation is coated but also a variety 

of preparations in which the contact of the active 
ingredient with the ion exchanger is suppressed or 

inhibited. Polymers such as a water-soluble polymer, 
an enteric polymer and so on can be used as the coating 

agent for the coated preparation. The using amount of 
the ion exchanger is about 10 to 5,000 parts by weight 

per 100 parts by weight of the active ingredient. Said 

solid preparation can remarkably decrease the unpleasant 
taste and odor of the active ingredient such as 

bitterness, being excellent in dissolution property and 
absorbability of the active ingredient.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a solid preparation
providing for improved compliance through the masking
of the unpleasant taste and/or odor of a drug and a
method of producing the same. The invention finds
application in the field of medicines.Many medicinally active ingredients have unpleasant
tastes, e.g. bitter or pungent tastes, and/or
unpleasant odors. Because such medicinal substances
cannot be easily taken orally by young children and the
aged, the dosage and administration recommendations are
sometimes neglected so that the so-called compliance
problem occurs at times.Therefore, to provide pharmaceutical preparations
with improved tastes and odors, several approaches have
heretofore been suggested. Among them are (1) the
method comprising adding a corrigent such as a sweetener
to a medicinally active ingredient and processing
the mixture into a preparation, (2) the method in which
the medicinally active ingredient is absorbed physically
on a carrier, (3) the masking method comprising
microencapsulating or cladding the medicinally active
ingredient with a wall-forming or coating material, and 
(4) the method comprising complexing the medicinally
active ingredient with an ion exchange resin.The first-mentioned method (1), however, has the
disadvantage that depending on the threshold bitterness
of the medicinally active ingredient, inter-patient
differences in gustatory sensibility, etc., the bitterness,
for instance, cannot be sufficiently controlled.
The second-mentioned method (2) calls for the use of an
absorbent in a large quantity for effective absorption
of the medicinally active ingredient, leading to an
increase in dosage unit size. The third-mentioned
method (3) is also disadvantageous in that an excessive
increase in wall or film thickness detracts from the
gastrointestinal absorption of the medicinally active
ingredient while an excessive reduction in wall or film
thickness results in a premature development of bitterness,
with the result that its bitterness can hardly be
controlled efficiently without decreasing the absorbability
of the active ingredient. Moreover, the pharmaceutical
manufacturing process is complicated of necessity
and, yet, no commensurate suppression of the
unpleasant taste and/or odors can be expected.Regarding the fourth-mentioned method (4), British
Patent 1462356, Research Disclosure 176019 (Derwent
WPI Acc No. 78-92367A/51) and Research Disclosure
176020 (Derwent WPI Acc No. 78-92368A/51) describe
complexes of β-lactam antibiotics with cation exchange 
resins and
