A verification method in a system comprising
Î± communicating devices Ai connected to a centralised

verification device B by means of communication
interfaces:


each communicating device Ai

having data processing means (11),
communication means (10), storage means (13; 14; 15)

and means of producing random or pseudo-random

numbers (12),
executing a digital signature algorithm and
producing a digital signature signal, and
transmitting a digital signature signal to the
centralised verification device B,
the centralised verification device B

having data processing means (30),
communication means (31) and storage means (32; 33;

34),
verifying, in a processing by batches, at the
same time, a set comprising more than one element of

digital signature signals, once all these digital
signature signals have been received, by
effecting, first of all, processings on the
digital signature signals received, and by

first of all calculating the processing C, D, G,
where 


y
i
 being the public key;
r
i,j
 being the first part of the signature,
r
i,j
 = (g
k
i,j modp) mod q
;
s
i,j
 being the second part of the signature;
t
i
 being the number of DSS signatures to verify;
c. if the test is true, B accepts all the
signatures.
A method according to Claim 1, characterised
in that, if the test fails, B executes a tree search,

by cut and choose, in order to find where the false
signatures are.
A method according to Claim 1, characterised
in that B converts the pairs into standard DSS

signatures by substituting 
r
i,j
 = R
i,j
 modulo q for
R
i,j
.
A method according to Claim 2, characterised
in that B converts the pairs into standard DSS 

signatures by substituting 
r
i,j
 = R
i,j
 modulo g for
R
i,j
.
A method according to Claim 2, characterised
in that the method by cut and choose comprises

collecting messages corresponding to the same public
key y
i
.
A method according to Claim 4, characterised
in that the method by cut and choose comprises the

collection of messages corresponding to the same
public key y
i
.
