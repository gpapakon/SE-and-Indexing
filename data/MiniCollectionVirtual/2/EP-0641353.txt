<ABSTRACT>
The invention includes oligonucleotides which are complementary to the 3'-end untranslated regions or to at least some of the splicing recognition region of an mRNA transcript precursor for a particular immunoglobulin heavy chain. More particularly, the oligonucleotides are complementary to at least a continuous 12 nucleotide segment of the sequence upstream to the 3' splice junction up to and including the branch point A residue. Sequences of some of the oligonucleotides of the invention are the underlined portions of SEQ ID NOS: 3-33. These oligonucleotides will hybridize with the splicing recognition region and prevent or inhibit maturation of the mRNA. This will prevent production of mRNA encoding a complete immunoglobulin, so that it will not be translated into a functional immunoglobulin. The invention also pertains to the preparation of these anti-sense oligonucleotides for specifically suppressing IgG and/or IgM production in patients suffering from autoimmune diseases and for specifically suppressing IgE in patients suffering from allergic diseases manifested by immediate-type hypersensitivities.

<DESCRIPTION>
 ANTI-SENSE OLIGONUCLEOTIDES FOR ISOTYPE-SPECIFICSUPPRESSION OF IMMUNOGLOBULIN PRODUCTIONBackground of the Invention In man and many mammals, five classes of immunoglobulins, namely IgD,IgM, IgG, IgA, and IgE, are synthesized. An antibody monomer contains twoidentical light chains of one of the two isotypes, K and λ, and two identical heavy chains of one of the five isotypes, δ, μ, y, a, and e. Some of these isotypes havesubclasses. For example, in man, γ has γl, γ2, γ3, and γ4 subclasses. Antibodies have enormously diverse binding specificity characterized bytheir individually unique binding sites. Each heavy chain or light chain has its own unique variable region segment, as well as constant region segments whichdefine the isotype and subclass. A mature, immunocompetent, resting B cell has a rearranged genes encoding for the heavy and light chain variable regions and, therefore, a defined antigen specificity. However, while undergoing activation and clonal expansion process, a B cell can further mature and differentiate into a cell expressing one or more immunoglobulins of the five classes, all of whichbear the same variable regions and antigen specificity.The five classes of antibodies, which could probably bear the samevariable regions and the same antigen specificities, have different immunefunctions and are differently involved in the pathogenesis of immune system- related disease. IgM exists as a pentamer and is multivalent, and fixescomplement effectively; IgG generally is most effective in mediating antibody- 

 dependent cellular cytotoxicity and crosses the placenta to the fetus; IgA is most important in mucosal surface; IgE is dominant in sensitizing mast cells and basophils in pharmacological mediator release; IgD is on the B cell surface andis probably crucial in the B cell activation process. Among the different classes of antibodies, those of IgG isotype are most conspicuously involved as autoantibodies in autoimmune diseases, such as in rheumatoid arthritis, system lupus erythematosus, Graves' disease, Hashimoto's* thyroiditis, myasthenia gravis, pemphigus vulgaris, and idiopathic thrombocytopenia purpura. IgE is mainly responsible for immediate typehypersensitivities manifesting allergic rhinitis, extrinsic asthma, drug and food allergies, and atopic dermatitis.For treating certain diseases, such as one of the autoimmune or allergic diseases, it is desirable to suppress the antibodies causing the disease. Since IgG is responsible for many autoimmune diseases, and IgE is mainly
