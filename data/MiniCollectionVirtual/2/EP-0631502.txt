<ABSTRACT>
Fragments from the polymorphic domains of Class I HLA antigen domains are used to modulate T-cell activity. The peptides are from the alpha 1- or  alpha 2 domains, particularly of the HLA-A, and B antigens. The peptides may be conjugated to other compounds to be used in diagnosis and therapy. The peptides may block lysis, CTL proliferation or have other regulating effects.

<DESCRIPTION>
The field of this invention is the regulation of
cytotoxic T-lymphocytes using peptide fragments from
Class I HLA peptides.Cytotoxic T-cells, particularly cytotoxic
T-lymphocytes ("CTL"), are restricted in their activity by
recognizing a specific major histocompatibility complex
("MHC") antigen on the surface of the target cell, as well
as a peptide bound in a cleft of the MHC antigen. The
foreign antigen may be as a result of transplantation from
an allogeneic host, viral infection, mutation, neoplasia,
or the like. The involvement of the MHC protein appears
to be essential to the attack by CTL's against the cell
which includes the foreign antigen. The CTL's by
monitoring the presence of foreign antigens, are able to
destroy cells, which if otherwise allowed to proliferate, 
would result in the proliferation of pathogens or
neoplastic cells.In monitoring the presence of foreign antigens, the
CTL's also recognize transplants of organs, tissue and
cells, which come from allogeneic hosts. In order to
protect the transplant from the CTL's, various immuno-suppressive
procedures are employed. These procedures are
frequently unsatisfactory in not being completely
protective and making the patient susceptible to
opportunistic infection.In view of the very great interest in being able to
increase or decrease the numbers of CTL's and their
activity, there is substantial opportunity for developing
new techniques which would allow for regulating the CTL's,
while still providing substantial protection against
pathogens.Clayberger, etal., J. Exp. Med. (1985) 11:1709-1714
describe HLA-A2 antigen in comparisons with HLA-Aw68 and
Aw69. Townsend, etal., Cell, (1986) 44:959-968 suggests
that CTL recognize segmental epitopes of denatured or
degraded proteins in a similar way as helper T-cells.
Holmes and Parham, EMBO J., (1985) 4:2849-2854 describe
the relationship of HLA-A2, Aw68 and Aw69. CTL target
specificity has been taught to be extremely sensitive to
changes in structure of human Class I molecules (Durna and 
Pease, Transplantation, (1986) 41:279-285: Biddison, et
al., J. Immunol., (1980) 124:548-552: Spits, et al.,
Immunogenetics, (1982) 16:503-512: Gaston, et al., J. Exp.
Med. (1983) 158:280-293).Mutants which affect recognition by CTL have been
studied in mice (Nathenson, et al., Ann. Rev. Immunol.
(1986) 4:471-502: Schulz, et al., Proc. natl. Acad. Sci.
USA (1983) 80:2007-2011) and humans, (Krangel,
Biochemistry (1982) 21:6313-6321: Krangel, et al., J.
