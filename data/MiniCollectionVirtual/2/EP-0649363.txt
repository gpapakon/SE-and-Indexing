<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a stapler with a staple magazine (22) to take strips of staples with their sides guided between side walls of the staple magazine (22) and a staple feeder (28), sliding in a guide (60) of the staple magazine (22), formed from bent sheet metal, which can be pushed by the fronts (50) of two mutually parallel sides (44) against the sides of the strip of staples (41) in the staple magazine, under the effect of a spring (26). In order to ensure that the staple feeder bears on the sides of the staples without jamming even when thin-walled material is used, the sides (44) of the staple feeder are transversely deformed (48) to form a corner, at least in the region of their frontal edges (50).

Stapler, having a staple magazine (22), which is capable 
of swivelling to a limited degree on a base part (14), 

for receiving staples which are lined up in groups one 
behind the other and are guided with their side limbs 

between side walls of the staple magazine, and having a 
staple pusher (28) preferably in the form of a bent 

sheet-metal part, which is guided in a push guideway (40) 
of the staple magazine (22), may under the action of a 

spring (26) strike with the front edges (50) of two 
parallel pusher limbs (44) resting against the side walls 

of the staple magazine (22) against the side limbs of the 
staple group (41) situated in the staple magazine (22) 

and may with the aid of a pulling mechanism (36) be 
lifted off said staple group counter to the action of the 

spring (26), 
characterized in that
 both limbs (44) of the 
staple pusher (28) at least in the region of their front 

edges (50) have a transverse deformation (48) directed 
towards the interior of the pusher limbs (44). 
Stapler according to claim 1, 
characterized in that
 the 
transverse deformation takes the form of a stamped 

portion (48) directed towards the interior of the pusher 
limbs (44). 
Stapler according to claim 2, 
characterized in that
 the 
stamped portion (48) has a depth corresponding to 0.5 to 

2 times the material thickness. 
Stapler according to one of claims 1 to 3, 
characterized 
in that
 the transverse deformation (48) in the region of 
the front edge has the shape of an outward bulge or 

offset.  
 
Stapler according to one of claims 2 to 4, 
characterized 
in that
 the stamped portion (48) extends in the region of 
the front edge (50) over 1/3 to 2/3 of the limb length. 
Stapler according to one of claims 1 to 5, 
characterized 
in that
 the staple pusher (28) has a substantially U-shaped 
profile delimited by the pusher limbs (44) and a 

web (42) which connects the pusher limbs (44) to one 
another, and that the pusher limbs (44) have a front 

projection (46) delimited by the front edges (50). 
Stapler according to claim 6, 
characterized in that
 the 
height of the projection (46) corresponds to 1 to 5 times 

the material thickness of the staple pusher (28). 
Staple according to claim 6 or 7, 
characterized in that
 
the stamped portion (48) extends over the entire height 

of the projection (46). 
Staple according to one of claims 2 to 7, 
characterized 
in that
 the stamped portion (48) extends over the entire 
pusher length. 
Stapler according to one of claims 1 to 9, 
characterized 
by
 a respective stop tab (52) projecting beyond the top 
edge of each pusher limb in the limb plane at a distance 

from the front edge (50), said stop tab having a stop 
edge (54) directed towards the front for the pulling 

element in the form of a towing eye (36).
