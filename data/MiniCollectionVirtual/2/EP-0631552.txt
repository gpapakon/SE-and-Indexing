<DESCRIPTION>
My invention relates to small boats and more
particularly to boats which fold and in which certain folded
parts nest within other parts for compact transport and
storage.Folding boats are well known in the small boat art.
Some of the prior art boats include U.S. Patent #5,052,324
to Lesly which sets forth a multipontoon boat in which the
pontoons pivot relative to one another to reduce the overall
width.U.S. Patents #3,684,139 to Johnson; #4,841,900 to
Maselko; #4,827,865 to Yelderman; #3,724,011 to Scholle are
exemplary of rigid boat sections hinged together so that the
bow folds over the stern. These reduce the length by half,
but the width remains unchanged.U.S. Patent #3,822,427 to Ewart and U.S. Patent
#3,996,635 to Wilkes both teach dividing the boat
transversely into multiple rigid sections which nest together
to further shorten the length of the boat. These do not
however, reduce the width of the collapsed boat. A great
reduction in both width and length of a boat for storage is
desirable. This may be accomplished by use of inflatable
construction. However inflated boats do not have the
rigidity and fine lines often desired in a small boat.It is accordingly an object of the invention to provide
a boat that has rigid surfaces and fine lines when open and
that is composed of rigid sections that fold and nest
together so that both the overall width and length of the
closed boat are thereby greatly reduced for transport and
storage. It is a further object of the invention that the
boat be readily converted between closed and open conditions
without special skills. It is yet another object of the 
invention that the open condition provide a rigid boat with
good operating characteristics.The folding and nesting boat of the invention according to
independent claims 1, 10, 13 comprises an elongate boat divided transversely
into at least two separable sections each section is divided
into a port and a starboard portion that are permanently hinged to one another
so that they may be folded together to thereby reduce the
overall width by about half. The folded, separated sections
are arranged to nest together in the folded state to thereby
reduce the overall length by about half when there are two
separable sections and by even a greater amount when there
are more than two separated sections. Joining means are
provided to join the unfolded sections together to provide a
water-tight, rigid boat in the open condition.These and other objects, advantages and features of the
invention will become more apparent

wall member at each margin that is adjacent an adjoining
portion, all the wall members of a portion being joined

together with said at least one rigid side of said
portion in water-tight connection, said wall portions

cooperating with said fastening means for securely
joining said portions and sections together in said open

condition.
The boat according to claim 7 further comprising:

a connecting member having a horizontal member joined
to four vertical members dependent therefrom, said

connecting member arranged for resting atop a
junction of four of said portions with each of said

vertical members arranged to engage an angle formed
by a junction of one said upstanding wall member

with another said upstanding wall member of the same
portion.
The boat according to claim 8, in which said connecting
member is provided with a seat on said horizontal member.
A portable foldable and nestable boat capable of being 
readily converted between a rigid boat configuration for

operation and a compact package configuration for storage
and transport, said boat comprising:


A) a boat hull having, in said boat configuration, a
transom, a bottom, a bow, rigid sides, a

substantial length along a centerline, and a width
that is less than said length, said hull separable

B) a foldable forward section including said bow, said
forward section comprising a port bow portion and a

starboard bow portion hingedly connected together
