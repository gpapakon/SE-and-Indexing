<ABSTRACT>
A method for controlling the morphogenesis of plant organs is disclosed which comprises causing the underexpression of a homeotic gene responsible for determining the identity of the plant organ in object. The method has particular application to flowers, where, by way of a first example herein, the flower petunia has been modified to present an additional whorl of petals derived from the modification of sepals. The additional whorl of petals may be formed by the conversion of sepals to petals, and/or by the stimulation of the growth of the existing petal structures to define inverted structures that appear to present a second whorl. The hometoic gene green petal in petunia has been cloned and characterized and is presented herein, both alone and in association with expression control sequences and in vectors for transgenic ectopic expression. In a second example, the same flower may be modified to present a whorl of petals having sepaloid characteristics along at least a portion thereof. The invention extends to a promoter construct derived from the CaMV 35S promoter and designated herein m35S. The promoter is particularly suited for the construction of homeotic transgenes in accordance wtih the present method. Petunia flowers having a whorl of modified petals prepared by the present method are likewise disclosed.

<DESCRIPTION>
 A METHOD FOR CONTROLLING AND DETERMINING PLANT ORGANMORPHOGENESIS, A HOMEOTIC GENE, A PROMOTER ELEMENTTHEREFOR, AND RELATED USES THEREOF5 TECHNICAL FIELD OF THE INVENTION$>The present invention relates generally to the genetic determination of plant morphology, and more particularly, to the control of such morphology by techniques involving recombinant genetic technology. 10BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTIONThe study of plant morphology and morphogenesis has developed extensively with the advent of recombinant technology. Investigators have identified individual15 homeotic genes that act either alone or in concert with each other to determine structures in the developing plant. Variations in plant morphology have been noted through the ages, and recent studies have revealed that mutations of critical homeotic genes may account for such structural aberrations. The bulk of these investigations have sought to determine both the manner in which such aberrations20 result and possible avenues for application of such aberrations either to develop new plant strains and structures.More particularly, investigations have focused on the morphological determination of flowers, as represented by the following publications [Sommer et al. EMBO J.25 9(3):605-613 (1990); Schwarz-Sommer et al. , SCIENCE 250:931-936 (1990); Schwarz-Sommer et al., EMBO J. 7(l):251-263 (1992); and Jack et al., CELL, 68:683-697 (1992)]. The noted publications all deal with the elucidation of homeotic genes, such as the gene deficiens found in Antirrhinum majus (snapdragon) and the gene APETALA3 found in Arabidopsis thaliana.30 Specifically, gene sequences are disclosed as are aspects of gene structure that control differentiation (the MADS-box), and their interaction with other homeotic genes determining flower organ morphology. These investigations identified the mutation of the genes and the consequences of such mutation, and sought to better 

understand the interrelationship of the combinatorial actions between the homeotic genes determining the four primary components of the flower.SUMMARY OF THE INVENTIONThe present invention is predicated in part on the broad discovery that the controlled expression of a homeotic gene, such as the gene green petal disclosed herein, can cause the conversion of a particular plant organ to another desired plant organ. More particularly, the invention is illustrated in a first embodiment by the overexpression of the homeotic gene green petal in petunia, to cause the conversion of sepals to petals so that an
