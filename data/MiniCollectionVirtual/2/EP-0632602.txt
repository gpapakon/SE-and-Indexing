<DESCRIPTION>
This invention, as stated in the title of this document, consists
of a communications adapter for data transmission by low and medium
voltage electrical distribution network, the object being to permit
data links to be set up over low and medium voltage electrical
distribution networks in systems that employ protocols and transmission
equipments not adapted to this transmission medium.Consequently, by means of the invention, data are sent over the
electrical distribution networks for their application in remote
operation systems, control and data acquisition systems, and remote
control and measurement systems for these electrical distribution
networks.Normal practice in communications in the field of remote operation
and control systems has employed different technologies and
transmission media, each one offering a series of advantages and
disadvantages but with none being clearly superior to the others. In
general it may be considered that the transmission media employed can
be divided into those that use a physical medium of transmission (e.g.
dedicated telephone tielines or the public switching network, optical
fibre, coaxial cable, electrical distribution networks, etc.) and those
that do not use a physical medium (e.g. radio or satellite links,
etc.). The advantages and disadvantages of each of these have been
described in the comparative tables contained in the article entitled
"Automating the power grid" by Dennis J. Gaushell, IEEE Spectrum,
October 1985, pages 39 to 45.In general it may be said that radio-based systems have a greater
range than those using physical media. In addition, it is obvious that
extending systems that do not use physical media is less costly, as the
laying of new communications lines is always expensive and complicated.Nevertheless, the transmission signalling rates in radio systems
are always less than in those that use physical media.It should also be kept in mind that the installation of radio 
equipment is subject to legislation and, in certain areas, its use is made
impossible because of frequency saturation.The use of the existing medium and low electrical distribution networks,
as the physical media of transmission for carrying out remote control and
measurement operations on electrical distribution networks, is extremely
attractive because the electricity utilities actually own them and, in addition,
complete coverage is guaranteed because they connect precisely with the
locations where the remote commands have to be obeyed. The main
drawback offered by their use
