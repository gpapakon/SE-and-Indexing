<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to novel DNAs,
polypeptides encoded thereby and methods for detecting
the DNAs and the polypeptides. The present invention is
useful for diagnosis of t(8;21) translocation type acute
myeloid leukemia.The t(8;21) translocation type acute myeloid
leukemia is an acute myeloid leukemia (hereinafter also
referred to as "AML") which accompanies translocation of
a gene on chromosome 8 to chromosome 21, which is one the
most frequent acute myeloid leukemias ranking with
t(15;17) translocation type acute myeloid leukemia. The
t(8;21)(q22;q22) translocation type acute myeloid
leukemia morphologically associates with FAB-M2 subtype
of AML (Fourth International Workshop on Chromosomes in
Leukemia, 1982, Cancer Genet. Cytogenet. 11, 284 (1984);
J.D. Rowley, Sem. Hematol. 27, 122 (1990)). Leukemic
cells with the t(8;21) translocation are uniquely
characterized by a high frequency of Auer rods and
mutation of granulocytic line (R. Berger et al., Blood
59, 171 (1982)). Cytogenetically, this translocation is
often accompanied by a loss of sex chromosome which is
rarely observed in acute leukemias without t(8;21) 
translocation.Diagnosis of t(8;21) translocation type AML can be
attained by detecting the above-mentioned features or by
analyzing the chromosomes. However, these methods are
troublesome and the sensitivity of the diagnosis is not
satisfactory.Kearney et al (Cancer Genetics and Cytogenetics, vol.57, No. 1, November 1991,
pages 109-119) describes the use of a YAC clone which contains
DNA sequences which hyberdise to Chromosome 21 and to the derivatives of t(8;21)
(q22;q22) or AML. Shimizu et al (Genes, Chromosomes and Cancer, Vol. 3, No.3
May 1991, pages 163-167) describes identification of clones believed to the
close and distal to the t(8;21) breakpoint.Accordingly, an object of the present invention is
to provide means for diagnosing t(8;21) translocation
type acute myeloid leukemia by a simple operation with
high sensitivity.As a result of intensive study, the present
inventors discovered that a transcript of a fused gene of
AML1 gene (H. Miyoshi et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.
U.S.A. 8, 10431 (1991)) on chromosome 21 and an unknown
gene neighboring the AML1 gene exists, the unknown gene
being translocated from chromosome 8. The present
inventors also succeeded in determining the nucleotide
sequence of the fused gene. The present inventors
further discovered a method for diagnosing t(8;21)
translocation type AML by specifically detecting the
fused gene or the transcript thereof,
