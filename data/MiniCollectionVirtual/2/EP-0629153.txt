<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method of producing a mineral 
fibre element comprising a mineral fibre base layer having a surface 
coating in the form of a fibrous netting formed of a thermoplastic 
polymer material, wherein such a surface coating is provided on at 
least a part of the surface of the base layer. Mineral fibre material is used i.a. for thermal and acoustic 
insulation in a number of connections. In order to increase the tactility of the mineral fibre material 
used during the handling and mounting thereof it may be coated with 
a surface layer, e.g consisting of a non-woven sheet material of 
polymer fibres. Furthermore, such a surface coating serves to reduce or eliminate 
the release of fibre wads or single fibres from the mineral fibre 
material to the surroundings before, during or after mounting. Furthermore, a surface coating of the above mentioned type imparts a 
considerably increased tensile strength to the mineral fibre 
element. It is known to produce mineral fibre elements of the type mentioned 
in the introductory part by adhering a pre-manufactured, non-woven 
web material consisting of polymer fibres to the surface of a 
web-formed mineral fibre material by using a resin, such as phenol 
formaldehyde resin, as an adhesive and by subsequently cutting the 
coated mineral fibre web so as to form individual mineral fibre 
matts. FR-1.137.652 discloses a process of this type. Non-woven polymer fibre materials can be produced from thermoplastic 
polymers which i.a. are characteristic in being adhesive in melted 
state. In the production of non-woven fibre materials the adhesive 
effect can be used to bond the individual fibres together to form a 
coherent layer.  
 However, the prior art method suffers from several drawbacks. In order to impart sufficient strength to the non-woven material so 
as to enable it to resist strains during the handling thereof and in 
particular during the application of the material onto the uneven 
surface of the mineral fibre material, the material used should have 
a surface weight of at least about 20 g/m². However, it is not necessary to use a surface coating having a 
surface weight of such a magnitude in order to obtain a functional 
coating, and hence the prior art method involves a certain waste of 
material. Furthermore, the resin used for adhering the non-woven material 
implies an increase in the thermal value of the surface coated 
mineral fibre element, which is undesirable for fire safety reasons. In addition, mineral fibre
