<ABSTRACT>
Method for the distribution of returns (4) in the mail-order trade, particularly of articles of clothing (4), the returns, in a chaotic distribution, (4) being stored fully automatically in a return store (14, 19, 21), the data of the store positions (31a, 31b) and the specific return data (10), preferably obtained by adopting the displayed bar-code labelling (6), of the individual returns (4) being recorded and only the commissioned extraction of returns from the return store (21) according to the data of the store positions (31a, 31b) and the specific return data (10) taking place manually, and a storage container (14) in box form for use in this method.

Method of distributing returned articles in a mail order dispatch centre, in particular
of articles of clothing, characterised in that the returned articles (3a, 3b, 3c, 3d, 29)

are automatically randomly distributed and stored into a returned article store (21),
wherein the data of the storage positions and the specific returned article data of the

individual articles (3a, 3b, 3c, 3d, 29) are detected - preferably by taking the barcode
thereon - and only the removal of those returned articles (3a, 3b, 3c, 3d, 29)

from the returned article store (21) is effected manually conditional upon an order
according to the data of the storage positions and the specific returned article data.
Method according to claim 1, characterised in that the fully automatic storage of the
returned articles (3a, 3b, 3c, 3d, 29) and the data collection are controlled by an

electronic data collection and processing unit (8), in which the data detected are
stored.
Method according to claim 2, characterised in that before storage the returned
articles (3a, 3b, 3c, 3d, 29) are subjected to a quality check and are sealed in

packaging material, preferably in foil (4), by means of a packaging device (2).
Method according to claim 3, characterised in that the specific return data of the
sealed returned articles (3a) are detected by means of a detection device, in

particular a scanner (5).
Method according to claim 4, characterised in that as specific return data, the order
number (10) of the returned article and/or a serial number (36) are detected.
Method according to claim 5 or 6, characterised in that the specific return data are
printed on the sealed returned article (3c) by means of a printer, in particular a foil

printer (9), preferably on the edge, or a correspondingly printed label is stuck on. 
Method according to claim 6, characterised in that the returned article (3d) is so
introduced by means of an automatic tool, in particular a robot (11) into a storage

container (14) having a front removal aperture (24), that the printed-on specific
return data (10, 37) are perceivable in the region of the removal aperture (24).
Method according to claim 7, characterised in that a plurality of returned articles
(28) are stacked in a storage container (14) until a predetermined level of filling is

reached.
Method according to claim 7 or 8, characterised in that the storage container (14) is
allocated to a specific storage position in the returned article store (21) provided

with a code (31a) and is disposed in the corresponding storage position by means of
a further tool, in particular a stacking robot (17).
Method according to claim 9, characterised in that the storage container (14) is
introduced into a movable storage trolley (19) having the individual storage

positions or being provided with a code (31b), the returned article store (21) being
formed from one or more storage trolleys (19).
Method according to claim 10, characterised in that the storage containers (14) are
stacked one on top of another and/or one next to another according to their code

(31a) of the storage position on the storage trolley (19).
Method according to one of claims 9 to 11, characterised in that before the storage
containers (14) are housed in the returned article store (21) and/or optionally the

storage trolley (19), the code data (31a, 31b) of the specific storage position and
optionally of the specific storage trolley (19) are applied to the storage container

(14) by means of a printer, in particular a labelling machine (16), preferably on the
front side (30).
Method according to claim 12, characterised in that in the electronic data
collection and processing unit (8), the specific return data (10, 36) and the data 

(31a, 31b) of the storage position and/or of the storage trolley (19) are allocated to
each individual returned article (28).
Method according to claim 13, characterised in that in order to carry out each
order, first the inventory of the return store (21) is scanned about the order.
Method according to claim 14, characterised in that the electronic data collection
and processing unit (8) communicates preferably via an interposed networking plane

(33) with an electronic data processing unit (34) allocated to the ordering plane.
Method according to claim 14 or 15, characterised in that as a function of the
scanning result, a goods ticket (35) associated with the relevant order and acting for

the manual removal of the returned articles (29) associated with the relevant order
from the returned article store (21) and having the specific return data (10, 36) and

the code data (31a, 31b) of the storage position and optionally of the storage trolley
(19) is created.
Method according to claim 16, characterised in that after the creation of the goods
ticket (35), the stock data of the returned article store (21) are updated in the

electronic data collection and processing unit (8) as a function of returned articles
(29) to be removed.
Method according to claim 17, characterised in that after completion of removal of
the returned articles (29), the storage container (14), upon reaching of a

predetermined filling level of the storage container (14) and/or of the storage trolley

removal aperture (24) for removal at the end face of the returned articles (29)

stored therein, characterised in that the storage container (14) is divided into two 
substantially equal-volume shelves (27a, 27b) by a central partition wall (26)

transverse to the longitudinal direction and in that one removal aperture (24) is
disposed on each end face (30).
Storage container according to claim 19, characterised in that in the region of the
removal aperture (24) a sealing device is disposed for sealing the removal aperture

(24) after filling.
Storage container according to claim 20, characterised in that the sealing device is

removal aperture (24).
Storage container according to claim 22, characterised in that the indicator
elements (28) are so formed that during filling they communicate with separately
