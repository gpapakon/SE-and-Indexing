<ABSTRACT>
A process and apparatus for the manufacture of 
chemical vapor deposition deposited structures which 

comprises supplying a solid metal (42), such as zinc, 
continuously to a heated retort (54) at a controlled rate. 

The retort is a body of refractory material having a top 
and a bottom and a transverse cross section which decreases 

from the top to the bottom of the retort. The zinc is 
melted, vaporized, and conveyed to a chemical vapor 

deposition zone (72) defined by a number of heated mandrel 
plates (48) where it is reacted with a reaction gas (38) 

such as hydrogen sulfide or hydrogen selenide to form a 
chemical vapor deposited structure. The process and 

apparatus provide for improved control over the evaporation 
rate of zinc and a reduction in the furnace volume needed 

to melt and vaporize the zinc.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a process using chemical vapor 
deposition for the manufacture of chemical vapor deposited 
structures, such as discs, domes, and plates. In particular 
this invention relates to an improved process for providing 
enhanced control of the rate of metal vapor, particularly 
zinc vapor, supplied to the chemical vapor deposition process. In the manufacture of ZnS or ZnSe components by chemical vapor 
deposition (CVD), as shown in Fig. 1, a mold upon which the CVD 
structure is to be deposited is placed in a CVD furnace above a 
source of zinc metal. Typically, the mold is made from a number of 
graphite mandrel plates which are arranged in the form of a 
rectangular box and bolted together. The CVD furnace is then 
covered, sealed, and vacuum connections are attached in preparation 
for operation of the CVD process. The furnace is heated to 
operating temperature (650-700°C) and a flow of reaction gas, H2S 
or H2Se, and an inert carrier gas, such as argon, is initiated. The 
CVD process continues until a sufficient depth of material is 
deposited, after which the furnace is cooled (approximately 24 
hours) and the mold containing the CVD deposited structures is 
disassembled and the structures are removed from the furnace. The current method of supplying zinc vapor to the reaction,  
 
as shown in Fig. 1 consists of graphite retorts 10 located inside 
the CVD furnace 12 below the mandrel plates 14 upon which the CVD 
parts are deposited. The retorts are loaded with solid zinc, 
either in the form of balls or disks. The retorts 10 contain the 
supply of zinc for the entire run (135-455 kg. capacity). These 
retorts are then heated to approximately 650° C to melt and then 
evaporate the zinc. The evaporation rate of zinc is a function of 
the surface area of the molten zinc 16, temperature at the surface 
of molten zinc, and pressure in the retorts 10. The measurement of 
the zinc evaporation rate is done by calculating the change in 
volume of the molten zinc 16 over time. The change in volume is 
calculated by periodically measuring the level of the molten zinc 
16 and calculating the rate by dividing the change in the level of 
the molten zinc by the period of time between which the readings 
were taken. The measurement of the liquid zinc level is done with 
a graphite float 18 on the zinc surface 20 which supports a 
graphite rod 22, a quartz connecting rod 24, and the magnetic core 
26 of a linear variable differential transformer 28 (LVDT). As the 
zinc evaporates the level
