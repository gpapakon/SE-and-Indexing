<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to the field of semiconductor
devices, and in particular, to a process for forming a semiconductor device having a
layer including an elemental metal and its conductive metal oxide.Semiconductor devices may have a layer in which electrical
characteristics are changed if the layer is oxidized or reduced.
With conductive materials, such as substrate regions, silicon
members, contacts, vias, and interconnects and the like, oxidation
is typically to be prevented or at least minimized. Conventional
materials used for conductive materials may include silicon
(monocrystalline, polycrystalline, and amorphous), metals, and
metal-containing compounds. Oxides of most of these materials
typically are insulators. The formation of insulating oxides can
result in electrical opens, which may not be desired.In some semiconductor devices, reducing agents may pose a
problem. In capacitors using oxide ferroelectric materials as the
dielectric, a reducing atmosphere may cause the ferroelectric to
become degraded. The ferroelectric may lose enough of its
ferroelectric properties to become virtually useless as a
ferroelectric capacitor. Ferroelectric capacitors appear to be
more sensitive with respect to this problem than many
semiconductor devices. Processing with a relatively inert
ambient, such as nitrogen, argon, helium, and the like, without any
oxidizing gases may still cause ferroelectric capacitors to
become degraded.In addition to ferroelectric capacitors, other semiconductor
devices may have problems with reducing agents, such as
hydrogen. Hydrogen may accelerate hot electron degradation of
many types of electrically programmable read only memories
(EPROMs) and particularly electrically erasable EPROMs
(EEPROMs). Hot carrier transport through a gate or tunnel 
dielectric layer generally lessens the number of times the EEPROM
may be cycled, wherein a cycle is the combination of a programming
step and an erasing step. Also, hydrogen may react with oxygen to
form moisture. Moisture in an EPROM generally causes data retention
problems.EP 0 478 799 is related to a semiconductor device with a
ferroelectric capacitor. After forming a transistor, a contact and
lower electrode for the ferroelectric capacitor are formed. After a
contact opening is formed to a source region of the transistor, a
conductive metal oxide is formed within the contact followed by a
platinum layer.
The conductive metal oxide protects the underlying source region
from oxidation. A lead-containing ferroelectric layer is
