<ABSTRACT>
A method of analysing a communication system to locate the source of a fault. The communication system comprises a signal carrying medium (9) coupled to a series of end station ports (2-6) which enable respective end stations (24) to transmit signals onto and receive signals from the medium and a controller (8) to control connection of end stations (24) to the medium via the ports (2-6). The method comprises disconnecting end stations (24) in series from the medium (9) in response to detection of a fault and then detecting whether the fault still exists. A fault analyzer (10) adapted to respond to the detection of a fault causes the controller (8) firstly to disconnect an end station (24) which has previously been characterised as the most likely source of a fault. The controller (8) may disconnect groups of end stations (24) and reconnect subgroups if no fault is present in the group which was not disconnected until the faulty end station is identified.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a communication system, for 
example a ring communication system or an open ended 
system, having a number of end station ports which enable 
respective end stations (such as computers and word 
processing terminals) to transmit onto and receive signals 
from a signal carrying medium. Communication systems of this type are highly 
sophisticated and rely on complex protocols to enable 
communication to be achieved between end stations connected 
to the signal carrying medium. Examples of such protocols 
are the token ring protocol and the FDDI system. These 
protocols incorporate certain fault recovery procedures if 
a fault should arise within the system. However, with 
increasing numbers of end stations being connected to 
communication systems, the existing fault recovery 
techniques tend to be slow and in addition the existing 
fault recovery procedures provide incomplete protection 
against the erroneous operation of the end stations 
themselves, against any out of specification operation of 
the system or major cable faults. Conventionally, ports are connected via so-called hub 
units which themselves can incorporate certain intelligence 
to enable faults to be detected. For example, in one type 
of hub unit, additional end stations within the hub are 
incorporated on the system which are used simply to detect 
if the network or system is operational or faulty. 
Internal control circuits can then process the information 
returned by the end stations and force other end stations 
connected to the hub to be removed in turn until the 
network or system is again operational. As mentioned above, these fault recovery techniques 
can be slow particularly in practical implementations where 
80 or more end stations may be connected to a single hub. 
Multiple faults will further increase fault recovery time. EP-A-0244775 discloses a ring network system in which 
terminal stations are connected through branch lines to a  
 
number of line concentrators. Each line concentrator 
includes control switches capable of disconnecting branch 
lines from the ring network whilst allowing the network to 
continue functioning. The disconnected branch line forms 
a local ring through cooperation with an internal 
transmission line. The line concentrator can then undergo 
internal diagnosis without disturbing communication among 
other line concentrators. EP-A-0431635 discloses a ring type LAN with a fault 
processing system. Each station is provided with a timer 
for measuring the transmission

A method of analysing a communication system to locate 
the source of a fault, the system comprising a signal 

carrying medium (9) coupled to a series of end station 
ports (2-6) which enable respective end stations (24) to

stations to the medium via the ports, the method 
comprising, upon detection of the fault by fault analysis means (10), disconnecting end 

stations (24) in series from the medium (9) and detecting 
whether or not a fault condition still exists,

has previously been characterised as the most likely to be 

the source of the fault. 
A method according to claim 1, wherein the first end 
station (24) to be disconnected is one of the most recent 

end station to have been connected to the system and the 
last end station which has been diagnosed as causing a 

fault. 
A method according to claim 1 or claim 2, wherein if 
the first end station to be disconnected is found not to be 

the cause of the fault, then the next end station (24) to 
be disconnected is the end station that is characterised to 

be the next most likely source of the fault and wherein 
this process is repeatable so that the next end station to 

be disconnected is characterised to be the next most likely 
source of the fault. 
A method according to claim 3, wherein the end 
stations are disconnected until the end station causing the 

fault is located. 
A method according to claim 1 or claim 2, wherein if 
the first end station to be disconnected is found not to be 

the cause of the fault then the method further comprises: 

a) causing the control means (8) to disconnect a group of 
two or more of the remaining end stations;  

 
b) detecting whether the fault exists; 
c)
