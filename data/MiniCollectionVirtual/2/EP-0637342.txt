<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to the use of probes targeting sequences from the 5'
untranslated region of HCV for genotyping of HCV isolates.The invention also relates to a process for genotyping of HCV isolates.The invention also relates to a kit for genotyping of HCV isolates.Hepatitis C viruses (HCV) are a family of positive-stranded, enveloped
RNA viruses causing the majority of non-A, non-B (NANB) hepatitis. Their
genomic organization indicates a close relationship to the Pestiviridae and
Flaviviridae. The sequences of cDNA clones covering the complete genome of
several prototype isolates have already been completely determined (Kato et al.,
1990; Choo et al., 1991; Okamoto et al., 1991; Takamizawa et al., 1991; Okamoto
et al., 1992b). These genomes are about 9500 base pairs long. The isolates
reported by Kato, Takamizawa, and Choo contain an open reading frame (ORF) of
3010 or 3011 amino acids, and those reported by Okamoto encode 3033 amino
acids. Comparison of these isolates shows a considerable variability in the
envelope (E) and non-structural (NS) regions, while the 5' untranslated region
(UR) and, to a lesser extent, the core region are highly conserved.Using cloned sequences of the NS3 region, Kubo et al. (1989) compared
a Japanese and an American isolate and found nearly 80% nucleotide and 92%
amino acid homology. The existence of sequence variability was further
documented when sequences of the 5'UR, core, and E1 regions became available
(HC-J1 and HC-J4; Okamoto et al., 1990). After the isolation of several NS5
fragments in Japanese laboratories, two groupes, K1 and K2, were described
(Enomoto et al., 1990). A comparison of the "American-like" isolate PT-I with
K1, which was more prevalent in Japan, showed that they represent closely related
but different subtypes with an intergroup nucleotide identity of about 80%. The K2
sequence was more distantly related to both K1 and PT-1, because homologies of
only 67% at the nucleic acid level, and 72% at the amino acid level were observed.
Moreover, K2 could be divided into two groups, K2a and K2b, also showing
intergroup nucleotide homologies of about 80%. Nucleotide sequence analysis in
the 5' UR showed 99% identity between K1 and PT-1, and at most 94% identity
between K1 and K2, enabling the use of the 5' UR for restriction fragment length
polymorphism (RFLP) and classification of HCV into groups K1 and K2 (Nakao
et al., 1991). Further evidence for a second group was given by the complete
sequence of HC-J6 and HC-J8, two sequences related to the K2
