<ABSTRACT>
Provided herein are carbohydrate complement-modified 
bifunctional glycoproteins, and their use in tumor-selective 

therapy. The bifunctional glycoproteins 
comprise a first component that specifically binds to a 

tumor-specific antigen and a second component having 
enzymatic activity by means of which a non-toxic prodrug 

is cleaved into a cytotoxic drug. The carbohydrate 
complement comprises at least one exposed carbohydrate 

residue selected from the group consisting of mannose, 
galactose, N-acetylglucosamine, N-acetyllactose, glucose 

and fucose. The modified carbohydrate complement 
contributes to increased relative concentration of the 

glycoproteins at the site of the tumor, and enhanced 
clearance from the general circulation and non-tumor 

sites.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to bifunctional glycoproteins
having targeting protein and enzyme properties. More
particularly, the invention relates to such proteins
whose complements of carbohydrate residues have been
modified in a manner that enhances the clearance of such
proteins from the circulation and increases the relative
binding of the proteins at the tumor site. The enzymatic
portion is capable of converting a prodrug into a
cytotoxic drug that attacks tumor cells.This invention also relates to the treatment of
tumors with such proteins, and the production of such
proteins, including recombinant production and production
by transgenic animals.In efforts to control tumors, attempts have been made
in the last twenty years to achieve selective therapeutic
effects based on the specificity of antibodies. However,
important therapeutic successes still have not been
achieved in the case of solid tumors. Although highly
specific tumor-selective monoclonal antibodies are
available for targeting purposes, the lack of success in
immunotherapy is primarily due to the small quantities of
monoclonal antibody molecules that can be localized to
solid tumors. One reason for this low degree of
localization, which is generally insufficient for
therapeutic purposes, is the presence of diffusion
barriers in the tumor (Jain, R.K., Cancer Res. 47: 3039
(1987)). Prior attempts to compensate by increasing the
dosage of the drug have encountered problems of
widespread non-specific binding in non-tumor structures,
and generalized toxic side effects.Prior art compounds have sought to utilize (i) the
specificity of a monoclonal antibody or tumor-binding 
protein partner and (ii) the catalytic amplification
potential of an enzyme. Such antibody-enzyme conjugates
can be administered to a patient and given time to bind
to the tumor. Thereafter, a non-toxic prodrug, which can
be cleaved by the enzyme portion of the conjugate to
yield a cytotoxic drug, is administered to the patient.
In theory, the enzyme portion of the molecules bound to
the tumor converts the prodrug in the vicinity of the
tumor into a drug which is cytotoxic to the tumor. In
reality, however, such compounds suffer several
drawbacks.First, such antibody-enzyme conjugates are highly
immunogenic in humans, since they represent chemical
conjugates composed, as a rule, of mouse antibodies and
xenogeneic enzymes. Repeated use of the same antibody-enzyme
conjugate on the same patient is therefore not
possible clinically (Bagshawe et al., Disease Markers, 9:
233
