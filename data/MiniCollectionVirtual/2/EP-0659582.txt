<ABSTRACT>
A reversible thermochromic composition develops 
fluorescent color of yellow, yellowish orange, orange, 

reddish orange, or red with a high color density and 
high color brightness, yet gives no residual color 

under non-color-developing conditions, and has 
remarkably improved light resistance. The reversible 

thermochromic composition, comprising a solubilized 
mixture of three components of (a) an electron-donating 

color-developing organic compound selected from 
pyridine types, quinazoline types, and bisquinazoline 

types of compound, (b) an electron-accepting compound 
for the electron-donating color-developing organic 

compound, and (c) a compound serving as a reaction 
medium for causing reversibly an electron exchange 

reaction between the components (a) and (b) within a 
specified temperature range.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a reversible
thermochromic composition. More particularly, the
present invention relates to a reversible thermochromic
composition which develops fluorescent color of yellow,
yellowish orange, orange, reddish orange, red, or the
like under color-developing conditions, and turns
colorless under non-color-developing conditions.Several reversible thermochromic compositions
are known which are constituted of a solubilized
mixture containing essentially a reaction medium for
causing reversible electron exchange between an
electron-donating coloring organic compound and an
electron-accepting organic compound in a specific
temperature range as disclosed in USP 4,028,118, USP
4,732,810, USP 4,865,648, USP 4,720,301, etc.These disclosed reversible thermochromic
compositions for developing yellow, orange, or red
color are not satisfactory in practical use owing to
insufficient color density, insufficient color
brightness, and to residual color in a decolored state. The present invention seeks to provide a
reversible thermochromic composition which does not
have the above disadvantages and develops a
fluorescent yellow, yellowish orange, orange, reddish
orange, or red coloration with a high color density
and high color brightness, yet gives no residual color
under non-color-developing conditions, and has
remarkably improved light resistance.After comprehensive studies on the combination of
the components of the color-developing system based on
the electron exchange reaction, it has been found that
these requirements are satisfied by a solubilized
mixture composed of (a) an electron-donating color-developing
organic compound; (b) an electron-accepting
compound serving as a color-developer for the above
compound (a); and (c) a reaction medium for coloring
and decoloring of the above compound in a specified
temperature range (as described in US Patent
4,028,118), but in which the electron-donating color-developing
organic compound (a) is selected from
pyridine-type, quinazoline-type and bisquinazoline-type
compounds. Further, it has been found that the
light resistance of the above system is remarkably
improved by incorporating a light stabilizer in the
system.The reversible thermochromic composition of the 
present invention therefore comprises a solubilized
mixture of three essential components:
(a) an electron-donating color-developing
organic compound;(b) an electron-accepting compound for the
electron-donating color-developing organic compound;
and(c) a compound serving as a
