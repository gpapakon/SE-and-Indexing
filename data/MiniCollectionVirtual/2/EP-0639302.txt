<ABSTRACT>
A device is disclosed for accomodating an electromotor (112) with a tubular casing section (114) which surrounds the motor armature and on whose front faces supports (116, 118) are arranged which belong to the motor casing and upon which are mounted bearings for the motor shaft (120). In order to obtain a motor housing which has particularly low vibrations and is thus particularly silent, at least one elastic damping element (122) is arranged between the inner walls of the accomodating device (110) and the outer walls of the reception device (100) and the outer walls of the motor casing (114) which face them. The elastic damping element (122) is supported on the facing walls of the accomodating device and motor casing (114). This vibration-neutralizing suspension of the electromotor reduces the noises produced by a fan motor in the ventilation channel of a motor vehicle air conditioning installation.
