<ABSTRACT>
The device is provided for the intermittent processing of articles (1), especially of syringe cylinders for medical syringes, and consists of a transport rotor (2) which is provided circumferentially with receiving elements (3) holding the articles (1) and open radially outwards. A loading station (4) serves for transferring the articles (1) onto the receiving elements (3) and an unloading station (5) serves for taking over the articles (1) from the receiving elements (3). A plurality of the receiving elements (3) are respectively arranged jointly on a receiving segment (7, 8) in a linear orientation relative to one another, every second receiving segments (7, 8) being connected rigidly to the transport rotor (2) in the circumferential direction. The respective receiving segments (8) arranged between them are connected at one end (9) pivotably about an axis (9) parallel to the axis of the transport rotor between a transfer position and a processing position, in the radially inward-pivoted processing position the orientation of the receiving elements (3) of the pivotable receiving segments (8) corresponding to the orientation of the receiving elements (3) in the rigid receiving segments (7), whilst, in the transfer position, the receiving elements (3) of the pivotable receiving segment (8) and of the rigid receiving segment (7) adjacent to the pivot axis (9) lie in a common vertical plane.

Apparatus for the cyclic processing of articles (1), in 
particular syringe cylinders for medical syringes, comprising a 

transport rotor (2) which at its periphery is provided with receiving 
elements (3) which hold the articles (1) and which are open in a 

radial direction outwardly, wherein a respective plurality of the 
receiving elements (3) are arranged jointly on a receiving segment (7, 

8) in mutually subjacently linear orientation and in the peripheral 
direction each second one of the receiving segments (7, 8) is rigidly 

connected to the transport rotor (2), and further comprising a loading 
station (4) for delivery of the articles (1) to the receiving elements 

(3) and an unloading station (5) for taking over the articles (1) from 
the receiving elements (3), characterised in that the receiving 

segments (8) respectively arranged between rigid receiving segments 
(7) are connected at their one end (9) pivotably about an axis (9) 

parallel to the axis of the transport rotor between a delivery and a 
processing position, wherein the orientation of the receiving elements 

(3) of the pivotable receiving segments (8) in the radially inwardly 
pivoted processing position corresponds to the orientation of the 

receiving elements (3) in the rigid receiving segments (7) while in 
the delivery position the receiving elements (3) of the pivotable 

receiving segment and the rigid receiving segment (7) adjoining the 
pivot axis (9) are in a common vertical plane. 
Apparatus according to claim 1 characterised in that the 
receiving elements (3) of a rigid receiving segment (7) and the 

associated pivotable receiving segment (8) which is pivoted into the 
delivery position are arranged equidistantly relative to each other. 
Apparatus according to claim 1 or claim 2 characterised in 
that at their side remote from the pivot axis (9) the pivotable 

receiving segments (8) are provided with a cam roller (10) which runs  
 

against a cam track (11), wherein in the region of the loading and 
unloading stations (4, 5) the cam track (11) is of a radially inwardly 

extending configuration. 
Apparatus according to claim 3 characterised in that the 
cam track (11) is formed by the peripheral surface of a cam disc (12) 

against which the cam roller (10) lies under the force of a stressing 
spring (13). 
Apparatus according to one of claims 1 to 4 characterised 
in that the pivotable receiving segments (8) are of a U-shaped 

configuration with profile limbs (14) which face towards the axis of 
the transport rotor (2). 
Apparatus according to claim 5 characterised in that 
provided on one of the profile limbs (14) is a connecting bar (15) for 

the stressing spring (13) which is connected with its other end to a 
stud (16) on the transport rotor (2). 
Apparatus according to claim 5 or claim 6 characterised in 

that a plurality of clip bar members (17) which form the receiving 
elements (3) are releasably connected on the outside to the rigid 

receiving segment (7) and to the outside of the back of the profile of 
the pivotable receiving segment (8), which bar members (17) are 

provided with spring tongues (18) for clamping the articles between 
them. 
Apparatus according to one of claims 1 to 7 characterised 
in that the pivotable and the rigid receiving segments (7, 8) each 

carry an equal number of receiving elements (3).
