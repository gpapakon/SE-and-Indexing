<ABSTRACT>
This is an edging machine in which elastic means (25) capable of urging the rocker (14) towards the associated feeler (17) are interposed between this rocker (14) and the supporting structure. According to the invention, this feeler (17) being mounted so that it can move on the supporting structure, there are provided, in addition, between the rocker (14) and this feeler, auxiliary elastic means (28) which are themselves also capable of urging this rocker (14) towards the feeler (17). Application to the edging of spectacle lenses.

An edge-trimming machine for a spectacles lens of the kind
comprising at least one cutting tool (12) such as a grinding tool or a

milling cutter which is mounted rotatably on a support, a rocker member
(14) which is mounted pivotably on said support about an axis (A2) which

is parallel to the axis of rotation (A1) of the cutting tool (12), a
support spindle (15) which is mounted rotatably on the rocker member (14)

about an axis (A3) which is also parallel to the axis of rotation (A1) of
the cutting tool (12) and which is adapted to receive axially in line with

the cutting tool (12) the lens (10) to be machined and at a spacing from
said lens (10) a template (16) and, carried by the support in line with

said template (16), a contact member (17) with, between the rocker member
(14) and the support, resilient means (25) capable of urging said rocker

member (14) towards said contact member (17), characterised in that, the
contact member (17) being mounted movably on the support, provided between

the rocker member (14) and the contact member (17), in addition to the
resilient means (25) operatively disposed between the rocker member (14)

and the support and referred to hereinafter for the sake of simple
convenience as main resilient means, are auxiliary resilient means (28) which

are also capable of urging said rocker member (14) in the direction of
said contact member (17).
An edge-trimming machine according to claim 1 characterised in
that the support load induced at the location of the lens (10) by the

auxiliary resilient means (28) is at most equal only to a fraction of that
induced by the main resilient means (25).
An edge-trimming machine according to claim 2 characterised in
that said fraction is of the order of a third.
An edge-trimming machine according to any one of claims 1 to 3
characterised in that, when the template (16) carried by the rocker member

(14) is in contact with the contact member (17), the support load induced
at the location of the lens (10) by the auxiliary resilient means (28) is

substantially zero. 
An edge-trimming machine according to any one of claims 1 to 4
characterised in that, the contact member (17) being subject to means (20)

for controlling displacement thereof, said displacement-control means are
themselves under the control of pilot-control means (30) which make it

possible temporarily to impart to the contact member (17), for a given
angular orientation of the support spindle (15) carrying the lens (10), a

dimension with respect to the template (16) which is less than the
reference dimension which is normally to be complied with for machining

the lens (10) in that angular orientation of said support spindle (15).
An edge-trimming machine according to any one of claims 1 to 5
characterised in that, the contact member (17) being subject to means (20)

for controlling displacement thereof, said displacement-control means (20)
comprise a nut (21) which carries the contact member (17) or which by

itself forms such a contact member (17), a screw (22) with which said nut
(21) is in screwing engagement and which is mounted rotatably on the

support, and a motor (23) whose output shaft (24) provides for driving the
screw (22) or by itself forms such a screw (22).
An edge-trimming machine according to any one of claims 1 to 6

characterised in that the point of action (26) of the main resilient means
(25) on the rocker member (14) is beyond the pivot axis (A2) thereof with

respect to their point of attachment (27) to the support.
