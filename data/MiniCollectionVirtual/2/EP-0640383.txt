<ABSTRACT>
In a process and mixer assembly, the assembly control unit is linked to inner (4) and outer (8) shafts rotating a mixer vessel (2). The inner (4) and outer (8) shafts are at an angle to each other and may be separately driven. The novelty is that the direction of rotation of the inner (4) and outer (8) shafts is periodically reversed, and that following reversal, the respective shaft is driven at a pre-determined speed of rotation; further that the speed of rotation following reversal is different from that of the previous cycle; further that the mixer assembly incorporates a control unit (16) with stored values.

Method of controlling the drive of a mixing 

apparatus which has a mixing container (2) rotatably 
mounted on an inner shaft (4) and an outer shaft (8), the 

inner shaft (4) and the outer shaft (8) enclosing an 
angle with one another and being drivable separately from 

one another, characterized in that the directions of 
rotation of the inner shaft (4) and the outer shaft (8) 

are changed periodically in each case, and in that, after 
each change in the direction of rotation, the respective 

shaft is driven at a predetermined rotational speed or 
with a predetermined rotational-speed function. 
Method according to Claim 1, characterized in 
that the predetermined rotational speeds of successive 

periods of a shaft (4; 8) are different. 
Method according to Claim 1 or 2, characterized 
in that the rotational speed of each shaft (4, 8) is kept 

constant, after a predetermined desired rotational speed 
has been reached, for a length of time which is shorter 

than the length of one period. 
Method according to one of the preceding claims, 
characterized in that the periods of the inner shaft (4) 

and the outer shaft (8) are approximately equally long. 
Method according to Claim 4, characterized in 
that the variations of the rotational speeds of the inner 

shaft (4) and the outer shaft (8) have a phase 
difference. 
Method according to Claim 4 or 5, characterized 
in that the phase of the outer shaft precedes the phase 

of the inner shaft. 
Method according to one of the preceding claims,  
 

characterized in that the predetermined rotational speeds 
of the two shafts (4, 8) are equal in adjacent periods. 
Method according to one of the preceding claims, 
characterized in that each sequence of predetermined 

rotational speeds recurs after N sequential time 
elements. 
Method according to one of Claims 1 to 7, characterized 
in that the sequence of rotational-speed values 

is stored in a memory and is called up sequentially. 
Mixing apparatus to carry out the method according 
to one of Claims 1 to 9, having a mixing container 

(2) rotatably mounted on an inner shaft (4) and an outer 
shaft (8), the inner shaft (4) and the outer shaft (8) 

enclosing an angle with one another and being drivable 
separately from one another by driving means (6, 10), and 

the driving means (6, 10) being connected to rotational-speed 
control means (12, 14) which are suitable for 

changing the rotational speed and the direction of 
rotation of the shafts (4, 8), and the control means (12, 

14) being connected to a control unit (16), characterized 
in that the control unit acquires the control values, 

corresponding to the predetermined rotational speeds, for 
the inner shaft (4) and for the outer shaft (8) in the 

respective period interval (t) and supplies them to the 
control means (12, 14).
