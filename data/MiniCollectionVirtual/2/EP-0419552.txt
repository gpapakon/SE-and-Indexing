<DESCRIPTION>
 A LOW TEMPERATURE BINDER COMPOUNDFOR REFRACTORY AGGREGATES ANDREFRACTORY PRODUCTS OF IMPROVED COLD STRENGTHBackground of the Invention 1. Field of the Invention;This invention relates to phosphorous- containing organic binder compounds for refractory ceramics, a process for the preparation of suitable binder compounds/ pre-mixed, ready-to-use refrac- tory/binder materials having long shelve-lives, a method of using the pre-mixed refractory materials, and high strength refractory articles produced from the pre-mixed refractory materials. 2. Description of the Prior Art: It is well known in the .art that there .are two general groups of refractory materials: Non-Basic Refractories, such as alu ino silicates; and Basic Refractories, such as periclase, dead burned dolomite and magnesite, all of which are composed mainly of CaO and/or MgO.Various materials have been used as low temper¬ ature (e.g., 400-2000°F) chemical binders in basic refractory products to impart a bond at temperatures too low for a direct bond to form through sintering. Good examples of these are sodium silicate, chromic acid and various inorganic phosphorous compounds. These compounds must be dissolved in a liquid medium to work effective¬ ly. For practical purposes, the liquid medium must be water since these binder materials are generally insolu- bla in non-aqueous media (e.g., organic solvents). In addition, most non-aqueous media also have other draw¬ backs such as fla mability, toxicity and high price. These binder materials have been useful only in basic refractor products which are prepared on-site .and used iismediately. Water is used as the liquid media but it is 

in only brief contact with the basic aggregate since heat is applied to the mixture immediately after it is implaced to remove the water. Examples of such products are gunnables, ra mables -and castables that are sold in a dry form. Since such products are mixed with water on- site and used immediately, they are not required to exhibit a significant shelf life in the mixed or wet condition.Premixed, ready-to-use, basic refractory ra - ming/patching mixes having a chemical binder uniformly dispersed throughout the mixes via a liquid phase have not been successfully produced in the past. This is due to the fact that basic refractory aggregates are not stable over long periods of time in contact with water. Both MgO and CaO will react with water to form g(OH)2 and Ca(OH)2r respectively. These reactions present the following problems with a prewetted refractory mix:1.
