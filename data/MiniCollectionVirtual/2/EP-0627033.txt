<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to front end loader
attachments and, more particularly, to an attachment
which is quickly and easily converted between a standard
loading bucket configuration and a side-shift angle dozer
configuration without the operator leaving the tractor
seat.Having a loader equipped with a loading bucket
permits the operator to scoop up loose materials, carry
them a short distance and then dump them onto the ground
or into a receptacle. Such buckets are very versatile
and are used in a wide variety of earth moving and
material handling jobs with great success.However, there are some jobs for which the
bucket is simply not well-suited. For example, when
back-filling a ditch, using the essentially single
purpose bucket to perform that task is tedious and
inefficient, and frequently produces poor quality
results. In order to return the long windrow or "spoil"
of dirt to the ditch from a position alongside the ditch,
the operator must repeatedly maneuver the tractor back
and forth at an angle to the ditch, pushing and shoving
the spoil pile into the open ditch while at the same time
twisting and turning the vehicle which tears up the soil
and grass in the vicinity. Much time is consumed in the
process and the end result is not a particularly neat or
professional-looking job.Instead of the bucket, it would be better for
the operator to use an angled dozer blade which has also
been shifted laterally from a centered position so that 
the operator only needs to drive along the ditch in a
parallel path of travel while engaging the line of spoil
with the angled dozer blade and thus continually
diverting the spoil directly into the ditch as the
tractor moves along. However, while such side-shift-angle
dozer attachments are currently commercially
available, they are intended for use only after the
bucket has first been removed from the loader arms,
leaving a place for the side-shift dozer blade to be
attached in their absence. While such interchanging of
the standard buckets and side-shift-angle dozer
attachments is theoretically quite possible, as a
practical matter the standard bucket is seldom replaced
with the dozer attachment because it is a cumbersome,
time consuming and difficult task to do so. For one
thing, the massive weight of the attachments themselves
makes such interchanging job a considerable effort for
one man to accomplish. Furthermore, the side-shift-angle
dozer is usually only required for a relatively short
period of time, whereupon it becomes necessary to reverse
the procedure and
