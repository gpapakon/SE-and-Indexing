<ABSTRACT>
A navigation system capable of setting a number 
of unspecified place positions with a simple construction. 

The navigation system comprises: information 
storage means stored with the block number data of a 

map data, which is composed of a topographic data and 
a character data in addition to the block number data 

for setting a place position in accordance with the 
block number of an addressing system, in distinction 

from the remaining data; input means for inputting the 
position; and picture means for reading out the map 

data from the information storage means on the basis 
of the position information inputted from the input 

means, to draw a map screen having the block information 
in the map at and around the inputted position.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a navigation
system for guiding a vehicle to a destination via a
predetermined route and, more particularly, to a navigation
system having such a data structure as to incorporate
the map data for indicating the detail at
and around a place position such as a present position
or a transit position, when this position is to be
set, selectively into the large section map data.In the prior art, the navigation system guides
the route so that the user may safely call at an inexperienced
destination by car. In recent years, various
technologies have been developed together with
various methods to improve the performances and functions
such as the precision, operability and visibility
of the navigation. This navigation system is equipped
with a screen to be used for setting a destination 
when the route is to be set and a display
screen to be opened automatically or upon the demand
of the driver. The display screen after the guidance
is started includes a section map for guiding a wide
area covering several sections including the section
of the entire route, in which the car is running, and
an intersection map for guiding the car at intersections.Some navigation provides the information the uncovered
distance, name and turning direction of the
intersection, at which the car should turn, so as to
cause no error in the run on the route, teaches the
characteristic object so as to allow the driver to
confirm the route during the run, and guides the route
not only by the display but also in a voice.For this navigation system to set the route, it
is necessary to input the starting point and the destination.
When these two points are determined by the
inputting, the route retrieval processing is executed
from the road information data at and around the
points and between the points so that the most proper
route is determined from a plurality of routes. There
have been proposed: a system, in which the registered
object position such as the starting point or the destination
is divided and encoded into genres such as 
sight-seeing places, parking areas, restaurants or
into the areas such as prefectures or cities so that
these codes are inputted; a system, in which a menu is
displayed in addition to the inputting of the code
numbers so that the user may select the items sequentially
from the menu and input the selected item, a
system, in which the position is inputted in terms of
coordinates of longitudes and latitudes; and a system
in which a telephone number is inputted.These systems are

<CLAIMS>
A navigation system comprising:

a)information storage means (3) for storing map data;
wherein


a
1
) said map data is composed of topographic data,
character data and housing data;
b) input means (11) for inputting a position; and
c)picture means (55); wherein

c
1
) said picture means (55) are adapted for reading out
said map data from said information storage means (3)

and displaying a first map of a larger section area at
and around said inputted position on the basis of said

map data;
c
2
) said picture means (55) is further adapted for
reading out the housing data of said map data from said

information storage means (3) and displaying a second
map;
d) control means (50) for controlling a transition
between said first map and said second map;

characterized by 

e) means arranged to display selectively
said first and second maps in response to

a driver's input;
f) said housing data including block number data of smaller sections around said input position, said data being stored separate from the remaining data; and
g) means arranged to display said second map so that the read housing data are superimposed on the first map.
A navigation system according to Claim 1, wherein
said block number data are composed of block numbers and

names of smaller sections.
A navigation system according to Claim 1 or 2, wherein
said block number data are determined on the basis of

administrative divisions.
A navigation system according to Claim 2 or 3, wherein
said information storage means (3) stores therein block

pattern data along with the block numbers, and that said
picture means (55) is responsive to receipt of an

instruction signal from said input means (11) for reading
from said information storage means the block number data

of map data and the block pattern data, and for depicting
or redrafting a second map with the block numbers and

block patterns contained therein.
A navigation system according to any of Claims 1 to 4,
wherein said first map and said second map are different

in scale from each other.
