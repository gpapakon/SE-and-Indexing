<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to papermachine clothing
comprising partially fused particles.A suitable particulate material can be partially fused
by means of a high energy input to give a structure containing
a multitude of interstices. When heated above their
crystalline melting point, the particles do not fluidise, but
adopt a viscoelastic form. The external shape of the
individual particles is substantially retained so as to
provide an array of continguously dispersed neighbouring
particles. Usually for the successful partial fusion of
polymers ultra high molecular weight materials (UHMW) must be
used, a typical molecular weight being 3 to 9 x 106 g/mol.
However, some materials such as polyurethane and thermoplastic
polyurethane do not need to possess an ultra high molecular
weight for successful partial fusion.EP 0187967 describes papermachine clothing comprising a
base cloth having a coating of a sintered product on one side
thereof. The sintered product does not cover both sides of
the base fabric. The base fabric is thus finely engineered
so as to avoid marking of the paper. Such fabrics are made
using long and arduous preparation techniques.EP 0342171 describes a method of depositing particles and
a binder system on a base fabric and relates to the product
of EP 0187967. A resin particle/binder/solvent mixture is
applied to a textile substrate. Significant costs and
stringent health and safety regulations concerning storage,
handling and disposal of solvents must be met, in addition to 
additional costs of raw materials. Further it is difficult
to obtain a uniform distribution of particles on the textile
substrate. This patent is only concerned with coatings and
not with an integral sintered structure as in the present
invention.According to the present invention there is provided
papermachine clothing made from partially fused particles and
comprising a reinforcing structure embedded wholly within the
partially fused particle structure. There is also provided
papermachine clothing made from partially fused particles.The fabrics of the invention can be made much more
quickly than those made by the method of EP 0187967 and are 
thus relatively cheap to manufacture.The particles are preferably polymeric, although other
materials such as metals may be used.This partially fused material exhibits greatly enhanced
abrasion resistance. The machine side of the material may be
grooved to increase the hydraulic differential between the
paper face of the fabric and the press roll and to aid
instalment of
