<ABSTRACT>
An electromagnetic detection system mainly for signalizing not visible obstacles during vehicle parking operation. The system comprises a transmitting-receiving mean (F) of radiofrequency field consisting of two wires or strips of electrically conductive material (antenna) coupled together; a mean (T) capable of creating, all around said transmitting-receiving mean, an electromagnetic radiofrequency field; a mean (R) capable of detecting the variations of said electromagnetic field produced by an object approaching the said transmitting-receiving mean; a mean (S) capable of signalizing such variations with an acoustic or view signal. Advantages: detection of the obstacles approaching the vehicle with absolute continuity for all the extension of the part which has to be protected (for example the bumper); detection of the obstacles not depending on their physical properties as shape, dimensions, density and reflective property, continuity of the obstacles detection from the maximum detection distance up to the contact without the blind zone (30-40 centimeters before the contact) which characterizes the prior art systems.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a system able to provide an
alarm signal indicative of the presence of any kind of obstacles
in proximity of the part of the vehicle which has to be protected.The application of this system becomes very usefull during
parking operation and mainly for protecting the back part of the
vehicle the most difficult to control from the driver seat.It is known, in the applicable art, to employ different
systems for use in vehicles control during parking operation.These systems include means vhich detect approaching
obstacles by monitoring with acoustic or view signals in all the
cases in which the direct perception of the driver is difficult or
impossible.It is possible to mention some examples of prior art for
use with the same purpose to which the present invention relates.For example, U.S. Pat. No. 4.278.962, is based on the use
of transmitting and receiving means of ultrasonic waves . In this
case the electronic system includes one or more transmitting-receiving
transducers mounted outside the vehicle bumper and an
electronic unit, electricaly connected to them, which provides to
decode the acoustic waves reflected by obstacles in proximity of
the vehicle and to signalize approximately the distance by digital
or analogic means.Such a system is nevertheless not always able to recognize
the real distance between the ultrasonic transdoucer and the
detected obstacle because the ammount of reflected ultrasonic
waves ( one of the parameters on which is based the distance
measuring system ) is depending on the shape ,density and
reflective property of the obstacle.Furthermore the ultrasonic system is unable to detect 
obstacles which are closer than 30-40 centimetres owing to
the physical limits of the system which is based on the
measurement of the time employed by the acoustic waves to
return after reflection.It is also known that the detection field, when using
ultrasonic system, has a conical shaped configuration and for
this reason it is not able to protect, for example, the
bumper surface for all his extension but only with an angled
limitation departing from the acoustic transducer. For this
reason, in order to obtain a more complete protection, it is
necessary the use of more than one acoustic transducer.In addition, the prior art ultrasonic system need the
use of external sensors (acoustic transducers) which are
visible and susceptible of handling and damage. Furthermore
the ultrasonic system is relatively expensive in his
components (electronic unit, ultrasonic
