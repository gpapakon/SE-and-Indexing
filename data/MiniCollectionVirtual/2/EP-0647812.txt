<ABSTRACT>
The device has a robot (8) which is displaceable or movable in the pipe (1) in the direction of its longitudinal axis (17) and has a part (15 or 16) which can be locked relative to the pipe (1) and is displaceable in the direction of the longitudinal axis (17) and rotatable about the longitudinal axis. The movable part (16) carries a tool (9) at its free end by means of a swivelling device (26). The tool (9) can be swivelled transversely to the longitudinal axis (17) by this swivelling device (26). In order to be able to use the robot (8) for various operations during pipe reconstruction, provision is made for the swivelling device (26) to have an interchangeable part (35), for there to be further interchangeable parts, designed as tool holders, as replacement for this part (35), and for another tool (Figs. 3 to 6) to be detachably or undetachably fastened to each of these interchangeable parts.
