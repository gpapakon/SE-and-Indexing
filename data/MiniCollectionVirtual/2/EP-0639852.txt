<ABSTRACT>
A low-pressure mercury vapour discharge lamp according to the invention 
has a discharge vessel (1, 101) which is sealed in a gastight manner and encloses a 

discharge space (2, 102) which contains a filling of mercury and rare gas. The 
discharge lamp further comprises means (3, 103) for maintaining an electric discharge 

in the discharge space (2, 102). A portion (5, 105) of a surface (4, 104) of the 
discharge vessel (1, 101) facing the discharge space (2, 102) has a reflector layer (6, 

106) of aluminium oxide particles which comprise a comparatively great porportional 
weight of larger particles with a median diameter of 0.25 to 0.80 µm and a 

comparatively small proportional weight of smaller aluminium oxide particles with a 
median diameter of 0.01 to 0.02 µm, which smaller particles are present dispersed 

among the larger particles, while the product of the median of the overall particle size 
distribution and the specific surface of all particles taken together is at least 4 x 10⁻³ 

m³/kg. As a result, the lamp has a comparatively high luminous efficacy.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a low-pressure mercury vapour discharge lamp 
comprising a discharge vessel which is sealed in a gastight manner and encloses a 
discharge space which contains a filling of mercury and a rare gas, which discharge 
lamp furthermore comprises means for maintaining an electric discharge in the 
discharge space, while a portion of the surface of the discharge vessel facing the 
discharge space has a reflector layer of aluminium oxide particles. Such a lamp, which can be used for reprographic purposes, is known 
from EP 0,270,866. The known lamp has a tubular discharge vessel. A first and a 
second electrode arranged therein in mutual opposition form means for maintaining a 
electric discharge in the discharge space. The discharge vessel is provided on a 
internal surface with a reflector layer which extends over the full length of the discharge 
vessel. The reflector layer leaves a portion of the circumference exposed so that a 
window is formed through which radiation can leave the discharge space. The reflector 
layer counteracts loss and undesirable dispersion of radiation and increases the intensity 
of radiation leaving the discharge space through the window. The reflector layer of the 
known lamp comprises aluminium oxide particles with an average size of 0.5-1.0 µm. Nevertheless, much radiation is lost in the known lamp owing to the fact 
that it is not reflected by the reflector layer. This is detrimental to the luminous efficacy 
of the lamp. It is an object of the invention to provide a measure in a lamp of the kind 
described in the opening paragraph which facilitates in a simple manner an improvement 
in the reflectivity of the reflector layer and thus an increased efficacy of the lamp. According to the invention, the low-pressure mercury vapour discharge 
lamp is for this purpose characterized in that the aluminium oxide particles comprise,  
 
besides a comparatively great proportional weight of larger particles of which the 
median diameter measured with a SHIMADZU particle size gauge is 0.25 to 0.80 µm, 
also a comparatively small proportional weight of smaller aluminium oxide particles 
with a median diameter of 0.01 to 0.02 µm, which smaller particles are present 
dispersed among the larger particles, while the product of the median of the overall 
particle size distribution and the specific surface of all particles together is at least 4 x 
10-3 m3/kg. The smaller particles are, for example, Alon-C particles. These have a 
median diameter of 0.013 µm. Smaller
