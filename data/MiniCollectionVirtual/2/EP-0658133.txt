<ABSTRACT>
A razor handle (10) for movably supporting a flexible, wet-shaving razor unit (30). The handle (10) includes a cartridge support (28), operable between a normal position and an advanced position, for providing support to the center of the razor unit (30) during shaving. In the normal position, the razor unit (30) is oriented in a substantially linear configuration, while in the advanced position, the cartridge support (28) is advanced outwards from the housing (14) of the handle mechanism such that the razor unit (30) is oriented in a substantially convex configuration to enhance the shaving of concave body surfaces.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention is a razor handle and, more 
particularly, a razor handle with at least one pivotable and 
flexible attachment member for movably supporting a flexible, 
wet-shaving razor unit, e.g., a razor cartridge, during 
shaving. Many types of razor handles are known in the art. Most 
modern razor handles are often designed to securably support 
a disposable cartridge at its ends and midpoint. Among the various types of razor handles known in the 
art are the channel-type handles, which typically have two 
fixed opposing bars adapted to slidably receive a cartridge 
having a corresponding fixed track. Such channel-type 
handles provide support to a cartridge along the entire 
longitudinal length of the cartridge. An example of a 
cartridge having a fixed track for engagement with a channel-type 
handle is disclosed in commonly-owned U.S. Patent No. 
4,516,320. Another type of razor handle known in the art includes 
spring-actuated engaging members which, upon the application 
of force to an actuator button, move inward or outward. 
After the cartridge has been properly positioned on the 
handle, the actuator button is released, allowing the 
engaging members to return to their "at rest" position and 
thereby engage the razor cartridge. Such handles have been 
designed to either fixedly maintain the cartridge or to allow 
"pivoting" of the cartridge during shaving. (The term  
 
"pivoting" refers to movement of the cartridge about an axis 
parallel to the blade edge). An improved razor handle which 
allows the cartridge to pivot or to be locked in a non-pivoting 
manner is disclosed in commonly-owned U.S. Patent 
No. 4,797,998 entitled "Lockable Pivotable Razor." Today, the use of flexible razor cartridges has become 
quite common. One early example of such a cartridge is 
disclosed in U.S. Patent No. 4,069,580 (which later reissued 
as U.S. Patent No. Re. 30,913). This flexible cartridge 
includes a pair of passages formed in the rear surface of 
the cartridge which are configured to receive a pair of 
spaced-apart, rigid pins extending from a handle mechanism. 
Another example of an early flexible razor is disclosed in 
commonly-owned U.S. Patent No. 4,443,939. The '939 patent 
discloses a flexible cartridge which is also supported by a 
handle mechanism having extending, spaced-apart, rigid pins. 
However, the '939 pins are of a relatively short length and 
are formed with bulbous ends. The rear surface of the 
cartridge includes a pair of "key-shaped" slots. To load 
the cartridge onto

<CLAIMS>
A razor handle (10) for a flexible, wet-shaving razor unit (30) 
comprising: 


means (22,24,26) for movably supporting said razor unit on said 
handle, said supporting means (22,24,26) being operable between a 

supporting position wherein said razor unit (30) is supported for flexing 
during shaving and a loading position for loading and unloading said razor 

unit (30); and 
a cartridge support (28) providing support to the center of said 
razor unit (30) during shaving said cartridge support (28) being operable 

between a normal position wherein said razor unit (30) is oriented in a 
substantially linear configuration and an advanced position wherein said 

razor unit (30) is oriented in a substantially convex configuration to 
enhance the shaving of concave body surfaces, characterised in that: 
the handle includes a selector dial (34) operatively connected to said 
cartridge support (28) for operating said cartridge support (28) between 

said normal position and said advanced position; 
said selector dial comprising a control slot (76) having an arcuate 
portion (78) and a linear portion (80), said arcuate portion (78) being 

continuous with and terminating in said linear portion (80); and 
said cartridge support (28) including an advancing pin (66) 
engageable with said control slot (76) such that said advancing pin (66) 

travels within said control slot when said selector dial is operated. 
The razor handle according to Claim 1, further comprising an 
actuator (20) connected to said supporting means (22,24,26) for moving 

said supporting means between said supporting position and loading 
position, said actuator (20) being biased against said loading position so 

that said actuator is at rest in a non-biased condition when said supporting  
 

means (22,24,26) is in said supporting position. 
The razor handle according to Claim 1 or 2, wherein said razor unit 
is maintained substantially rigid when said cartridge support (28) is 

in said advanced position. 
The razor handle according to any one of the preceding claims, 
wherein said cartridge support (28) is advanced on the order of .05 inches 

(0.13cm) when moved from said normal position to said advanced 
position.
