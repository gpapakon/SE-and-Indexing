<ABSTRACT>
A machine for applying at least one self-adhesive label to a 
bottle fed by a spacing star feeder (100) provided with bays 

defined by an envelope of idle rollers (13) projecting in such a 
manner as to be able to receive the bottle (33) under rotation 

without damaging it, comprises at least one label application 
station provided with at least one blade (201, 29, 34, 35) which 

subtends the web from which a label (30) is peeled off and which 
converges towards a plane tangential to that surface of the bottle 

to which the label is to be applied, and a bottle presser and 
drive roller (17) positioned in front of the bay and arranged to 

assume a position spaced from the bottle and a position in contact 
with the bottle and with the label being applied.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a labelling 
machine according to the preamble of 
claim 1. 
A labelling machine of this kind 
is known from US-A-5 188 696. This invention concerns more particularly the application of the label, counter-label 
and a third label known as the seal or neck-band to bottles. The label and counter-label are applied to opposite sides of the 
cylindrical portion of the bottle body, whereas the seal is 
applied to its frusto-conical part or to the cylindrical part of 
its neck. These machines comprise a star feeder which feeds the bottles 
equidistantly spaced to at least one labelling station in which at 
least a label is applied. Said station is positioned along the 
path of an intermittently moving conveyor, which comprises means 
for immobilizing the bottle while simultaneously rotating it. With said means there are associated a label feeder and a presser 
roller which causes the labels to adhere to the bottle. The 
labels used in these machines are of self-adhesive type and are 
provisionally fixed on a continuous web. In the feed station the web slides along the edge of a blade which 
is parallel to the generatrices of that part of the bottle to 
which the label is to be applied, and is positioned close to it. At the edge the web reverses its direction of movement, whereas 
the more rigid label continues in the same direction to position 
itself in front of the bottle at the disposal of the presser 
roller. The web moves at the peripheral speed of the bottle.  
 Said labelling stations are not able to apply the so-called seal 
to the frusto-conical part of the bottle in a sufficiently precise 
manner. The seal consists of a fairly thin strip with a widened part at 
its centre or, rarely, a single proper seal of circular or oval 
shape. The plan development of the seal is therefore similar to a 
half moon. The seal must be applied such that when adhering to 
the bottle it lies perfectly centered relative to the underlying 
rectangular label and perfectly horizontal. Centering is possible only if the centre line of the seal is 
firstly fixed, it then being necessary to delay the adhesion of 
the seal to the bottle until more than half of it projects beyond 
the blade which separates it from the web, while at the same time 
maintaining it as close as possible to the bottle but separated 
therefrom. An object of the invention is to locate the application station 
for at least one label directly on the star feeder, so avoiding 
the need to transfer the bottle into a separate

<CLAIMS>
A machine for applying at least one self-adhesive 
label to bottles, comprising means for conveying 

the bottles in a circular path, 
and a label application station comprising a 

blade (201, 29, 34, 35) for guiding and reversing the 
direction of movement of a support web from which the 

labels are peeled off and which converges towards a 
plane tangential to that surface of the bottle to 

which the label (30) is to be applied; characterised 
in that the conveying means is a spacing star feeder provided with 

bays, where the star bays of the feeder are defined by an 
envelope of idle rollers (13) projecting in such a 

manner as to he able to receive a bottle under 
rotation without damaging it, and in that the machine comprises a 

bottle presser and drive roller (17) positioned at the label 
application station facing the bays 

and arranged to assume a position 
distant from the bottle to be labelled and a position in contact 

with the bottle to rotate it and to press a label 
against it. 
A machine as claimed in claim 1, characterised in that 
said blade (201) which guides the web from which the labels are 

peeled off carries at its front, projecting in a position spaced 
from the edge guiding said web, a tang (210) covered with anti-adhesive 

material on which the label (30) slides after having been 
separated from the web.  

 
A machine as claimed in claim 1, characterised in that the 
presser roller is connected to an electric motor controlled by a 

microprocessor governed by an encoder. 
A machine as claimed in claim 1, characterised in that 
said application station comprises a first blade (34) guiding 

the web from which the labels (27) are peeled off, a second blade 
(35) guiding the web from which the counter-labels are peeled 

off, each blade converging towards a plane tangential to the 
cylindrical body of the bottle, and a third blade (29) guiding 

the web from which the seals or neck-bands (30) are peeled off, 
and descending from above to graze the neck of the bottle.  

 
A machine according to claim 4, characterised 
in that the third blade (29) is carried by means able to 

raise it during the application of the seal or neck 
band (30) and to bring it again in the lower position 

at the end of said application. 
A machine as claimed in claim 4, characterised in that 
the third blade (29) is rigid with a plate (48) connected to a fixed 

part of the machine by two connecting rods (51) and (52) and a 
cylinder-piston unit (65), by virtue of this latter the plate (48) 

and blade (29) being able to be arranged in a lowered position 
and to rise during the application of the seal or neck-band (30). 
A machine as claimed in claim 4, characterised in that one 
of the connecting rods (51), (52) comprises an appendix (520), at 

the end of which there is a roller (43) for tensioning the web 
(31) carrying the seals or neck-bands (30). 
A machine as claimed in claim 1, characterised in that 
said presser roller (17) is associated with an idle presser roller 

(18) of soft rubber such as sponge, which is arranged to come into 
contact with that upper region of the bottle on which the presser 

roller (17) does not act. 
A machine as claimed in claim 8, characterised in that the 
presser roller (18) is idly mounted on the same shaft as the 

presser roller (17). 
A machine as claimed in claim 8, characterised in that the 
presser roller (18) is mounted on a lever (213) which is 

independent of the presser roller (17) and by means of a cylinder-piston 
unit (214) can assume two positions, in one of which the 

roller (18) is spaced from the bottle, and in the other of which 
the roller (18) is 
in contact with the bottle.
