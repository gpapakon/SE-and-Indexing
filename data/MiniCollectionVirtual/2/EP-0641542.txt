<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an apparatus for analyzing
blood in a non-invasive manner, and
more particularly to an apparatus for analyzing blood components
necessary for a hematology test by optically measuring blood
flowing through blood vessels in a living body and a method using the
same apparatus.The items of hemotology test such as the number of blood
cells, hematocrit, hemoglobin, and corpuscular constant (mean
corpuscular volume: MCV, mean corpuscular hemoglobin: MCH, and
mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration: MCHC) are extremely
important for the diagnosis of diseases and the treatment thereof.
Such items are most frequently used in a clinical test of patients.Such hematology test involves collecting blood from a living
body to analyze the sample thereof with an analyzer. However, the
collection of blood from the living body causes a considerable pain to
the living body. The above method of hematology test is always
accompanied by a fear that needles for blood collection might cause
an accident due to error injection when they are used for collecting
blood from a different living body contracted with infectious
diseases such as hepatitis and AIDS. Thus, a demand has been made 
for many years that an apparatus be developed that allows
practitioners to perform a blood test in a non-invasive
manner. When such blood analyzer is installed besides the
bed on which the living body is laid, the practitioners can
monitor real-time conditions thereof on the spot without
difficulty. Examples of the widely known prior art relating to
such apparatus include a video microscope which applies
light to a subject portion of observation on a skin surface of a
living body to capture a video image thereof (static image)
at a shutter speed of about one thousandth second and
identifies discontinuous points in the blood stream which
points move one by one on the static image, and an
analyzer providing a video camera attached with a highspeed
shutter which captures red blood cells in the
conjunctival capillary blood vessels in an eyeball (see
Japanese Unexamined Patent Publication No. HEI 4-161915,
and USP No. 4998533).US-A-3 824 393 discloses a video microscope for counting
cells contained in a specimen.By the way, the speed of blood flow is about five mm
to tens of mm per second. When images of red blood cells
are captured at a shutter speed of one thousandth second
like in the prior art assuming that the blood flows at a rate of
10 mm per second, red blood cells move by the distance
equal to the diameter
