<ABSTRACT>
A cathode for the electrolytic deposition of non-ferrous 
metals, consisting of a plate (1) which, starting 

from one at least one of its vertical edges, is provided 
on both sides with coinciding zones (5) of dielectric 

material situated at the height of impingement of a 
number of penetrators which cause the upper edge of the 

deposited layers of zinc to detach. The plate (1) is 
provided with a slot (7), coinciding with said regions of 

dielectric material, which is occupied by a flat piece 
(5) of dielectric material, equal in thickness to the 

plate (1) and with surfaces which are flat and coplanar 
with those of said plate (1). The piece (5) and the slot 

(7) are provided with means of preventing the movement of 
said piece in any direction.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a cathode for the
electrolytic deposition of non-ferrous metals such as
zinc, copper etc., and more particularly to a flat
cathode consisting of an aluminium plate, designed
particularly for the production of zinc.In the cathodes of the type described above, the
aluminium plate is usually terminated along its upper
edge in a bar which is thicker and longer than said edge.
With this arrangement the cathodes are situated in the
electrolytic tanks with the aluminium plate in the
vertical position, the bar acting as a head for
supporting the cathode in the tank and for connecting the
lifting apparatus which handles it.During the process of electrolysis the zinc is 
deposited progressively over the entire surface of the
aluminium plate in the region which is submerged in the
electrolytic tank.Generally, the vertical edges of the aluminium
cathode plate are coated with a protective dielectric
material which prevents the zinc from being deposited on
the vertical edges. In this way the layers of zinc
deposited on each surface of the aluminium plate are
prevented from joining along the vertical edges of said
plate.The layer of zinc deposited on the cathodes adheres
to the surface of the aluminium plate. The devices used
to detach this layer include two vertically moving knives
terminating in converging horizontal lower edges, angular
in section and of approximately the same length as the
width of the cathodes. To use these devices for detaching
the plates of zinc from the cathode one knife is situated
on each side thereof, resting and pressing the edges of
both knives against said surfaces, above the height
reached by the deposits of zinc on the cathode. Then the
knives are moved downwards such that when their edges
meet the layer of zinc deposited on each side of the
cathode they carry out its separation.This system has the drawback that knives erode the
surfaces of the cathode over its entire height, making it
unusable after a certain number of operations. Due to the
high cost of the cathodes this system of detaching the
zinc is therefore inadequate.An attempt to solve the above mentioned problems has
been made by means of a system which includes two
successive phases of action on the cathodes. During a
first phase the upper edge of the deposited layers of
zinc are detached by means of a horizontally acting
lateral penetrator, and during a second phase the layers
of zinc are pulled free entirely by means of two vertical 
knives. The lateral penetrator consists of two

<CLAIMS>
A cathode for the electrolytic deposition of non-ferrous metals,
consisting of a plate (1) of aluminium alloy, or the like, preferably rectangular in

shape, one of its shorter edges terminating in a bar or head (2) which is greater in
length, whilst starting from one or both of its longer edges it is provided on both sides

of the plate with coinciding zones (5) of dielectric material, situated at the height of
the impingment of a number of horizontal penetrators which cause the upper edge of

the deposited layers of zinc to detach, characterized in that starting from at least one
of the edges which are perpendicular to said bar (2), the plate (1) is provided with a

slot (7) situated close to said bar (2) and coinciding with the regions of dielectric
material (5), said slot having a height which is greater than the width of the penetrators

and being occupied by a flat piece (5) of acid resistant dielectric material,
equal in thickness to the plate (1) and with surfaces which are flat and coplanar with

those of said plate (1) and whose shape coincides with that of the slot (7), the piece
(5) and the slot (7) being provided with means of preventing the movement of said

piece (5) in any direction, and consisting of a narrowing on both sides of the shape
of the slot (7) at its mouth, and a matching coupling (10,11) between the opposing

edges of said piece and those of the shape of the slot.
A cathode according to claim 1, characterized in that the matching
coupling is angular in section, with a convex shape (10) along the slot and a concave

shape (11) along the opposing edge of the piece of dielectric material.
