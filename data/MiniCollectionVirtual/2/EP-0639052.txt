<ABSTRACT>
Gloss-retention of chocolate compositions, in particular of chocolate coatings can be improved by incorporation of an amount of a fat blend, comprising two fat components i.e. A and B, A being a fat with a C18 trans-content of 15-70 %, B being a (H2M + M2H)-type fat, wherein H = saturated fatty acid  
>
/=  C16, M = saturated fatty acid: C8-C14, with a specific carbon number distribution, such that C40-C46/C30-C38 = 1-20; the amounts of B in the blend being: 0.2-30 wt. % on fat phase.

<DESCRIPTION>
Although trans-hardened fats are applied in confectionery 
fats, it is known that these fats often lack a good gloss 
retention. In the past it was proposed to improve the 
gloss retention of such trans-hardened fats by the 
addition of an emulsifier, such as sorbitan tristearate, 
to such fat compositions. Although the results of the addition of such an emulsifier 
were reasonable to good, we prefer to avoid the addition 
of an emulsifier. Therefore, we have sought for replacers 
of such emulsifiers, which replacers were of the 
triglyceride-type. 
This search has resulted in the finding that the addition 
of a specific type of triglycerides to fats, high in 
trans-hardened fats could lead to results that were at 
least comparable with those of the addition of sorbitan 
tristearate. Therefore, our invention concerns novel fat blends, 
comprising at least a fat A with a C18-trans content of 
15-70 wt%, preferably of 20-60 wt% and another fat B, 
which fat B is present in an amount of 0.2-30 wt%, 
preferably of 0.5-15 wt% (on fat phase), which fat B is a 
vegetable fat of the (H₂M + HM₂)-type, wherein H= saturated 
fatty acid with ≧ C₁₆, M= saturated fatty acid with C₈-C₁₄, 
preferably with C₁₂-C₁₄ and wherein the carbon number 
distribution of the fat constituents is such that: 
preferably 1-10, 
C₄₀-C₄₆ meaning the total amount of the constituents with 
40, 42, 44 and 46 carbon atoms in the fatty acid 
substituents of the compounds and C₃₀-C₃₈ meaning the same 
but with 30, 32, 34, 36 and 38 C-atoms.  
 Although the use of (M₂H + MH₂) fats in chocolate 
compositions is the subject of our co-pending patent 
applications EP 91306027.3; GB 9115421; EP 91306026.5 and 
EP 92200677.0, it is not disclosed therein that those fats 
can also be used in fat blends high in trans-fats (i.e. 
fats with a high amount of C18-trans). The hard fat component (H₂M + HM₂) can be the same hard 
stock as disclosed in the above patent applications. Thus 
interesterified mixtures of vegetable oils high in 
triglycerides with fatty acid residues with at least 16 C-atoms 
and triglycerides rich in lauric and/or myristics 
acid residues can be used advantageously. Very suitable 
fats are mentioned in our Australian Patent Application 
12346/83, S/N 549,465. 
Preferred fats are interesterified mixtures of fully 
hardened palm oil and palm kernel oil, e.g. an 
interesterified mixture of PO-58 and PK-39. However, also 
fractions of those hard stocks can be applied, e.g. the 
fractions as disclosed in above cited EP 92200677.0. These
