<ABSTRACT>
This invention relates to a purified Helicobacter pylori vacuolating toxin and methods to use this toxin to produce protective antibodies against H. pylori infection. Antiserum to this antigen can be used to detect the toxin. Methods to detect anti-toxin antibodies determine the susceptibility of a patient to develop peptic ulcer disease, gastric carcinoma, or other clinical consequences of H. pylori infection.

<DESCRIPTION>
This application is a continuation-in-part of
U.S. Serial No. 841,644 filed February 26, 1992.This invention relates to a Helicobacterpylori
vacuolating toxin, methods to use the toxin in
diagnostic testing for the predisposition to peptic
ulceration and gastric malignancy, and methods to use
the toxin as a vaccine for providing immunologic
protection against H.pylori infection.Helicobacterpylori is a curved Gram-negative
bacterium that is commonly present in the human
stomach; once acquired, this organism persists for
years or decades (Blaser, M.J. (1990) J. Infect. Dis.
161:626-633). Multiple lines of evidence now indicate
that H.pylori infection nearly universally results in
chronic gastritis (Dixon, M.F. (1991)
Gastroenterol. and Hepatol. 6:125-130 Although most
persons with H.pylori-induced gastritis remain
asymptomatic, this condition is a significant risk
factor for the development of both peptic ulceration
and gastric adenocarcinoma (Peterson, W. L. (1991) N.
Engl. J. Med. 324:1043-1048, and Nomura, A.,
Stemmermann, G.N., Chyou, P.-H., Kato, I.,
Perez-Perez, G.I, and Blaser, M.J., N. Eng. J. Med.
1991; 325:1132-6). The pathogenesis of H.pylori infection is not
yet well understood. The production of high levels of
urease by the organism (Dunn, B.E., Campbell, G.P.,
Perez-Perez, G.I., and Blaser, M.J. (1990) J. Biol.
Chem. 265:9464-9469), is thought to be essential for
the initiation and maintenance of gastric infection
(Eaton, K.A., Morgan, D.R., Krakowka, S. (1989)
Infect. Immun. 57:1119-1125). Another potential
virulence determinant is a toxin that induces
vacuolation of eukaryotic cells (Cover, T.L., Halter,
S.A., Blaser, M.J. (1992) Human Pathol. 23:1004-1010.
Functionally active toxin is produced in vitro by
50-60% of H.pylori isolates (Leunk, R.D., Johnson,
P.T., David, B.C., Kraft, W.G., and Morgan, D.R.
(1988) J. Med. Microbiol. 26:93-99 and Cover, T.L.,
Dooley, C.P., and Blaser, M.J. Infect. Immun.;
58:603-610 (1990)). Antibodies that neutralize toxin
activity are present in sera from H.pylori-infected
persons, which indicates that the vacuolating toxin
activity is relevant invivo (Leunk, R.D., Ferguson,
M.A., Morgan, D.R., Low, D.E., and Simor, A.E. (1990)
J. Clin. Microbiol. 28:1181-1184 and Cover, T.L.,
Cao., P., and Blaser, M.J. (1991) Gastroenterology
100:A570). Two studies have indicated that the
prevalence of infection with toxin-producing H.pylori
is higher among H.pylori-infected persons with peptic
ulceration than among infected persons with gastritis
alone (Figura, N.,
