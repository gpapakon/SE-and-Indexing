<ABSTRACT>
The present invention is a cone insert (10) for a 
liquefaction kettle (12). Pads (36) on the bottom of the cone 

separate the cone from the surface of the kettle (12). Solid 
material (20) is added to the top of the cone. Solid material (20) 

is melted on demand by an internal spray kettle ring (14) . The 
cone insert (10) provides continuous liquefaction and prevents 

sensitometric shift in photographic emulsions.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an apparatus 
for the liquefaction of gelled substances and, more 
particularly, to an apparatus for continuously liquefying 
gelled photographic material. In the manufacture of photographic film and 
paper, the liquefaction of gelled materials is required 
prior to coating these materials on the film or paper. 
Gelled photographic materials include aqueous or solvent 
based photosensitive or non-photosensitive emulsions and 
dispersions. There are two general methods that are known for 
liquefying gelled photographic materials: batch 
liquefaction; and continuous liquefaction. Batch 
liquefaction utilizes a jacketed kettle fitted with a 
stirring device. Heat is provided to the vessel through 
hot water or steam. The jacket system also provides 
chilled water for cooling. The jacket generally utilizes 
spray rings and operates under thin film heat transfer 
conditions. Jackets may also operate under flooded 
conditions although it is less common. Continuous liquefaction may be dynamic or 
passive. In dynamic continuous liquefaction, gelled 
material is forced into a heat exchanger by means of an 
auger and/or positive displacement pump. The system may 
include a vacuum chamber to remove air from the solid 
gelled material. Material is liquefied in the heat 
exchanger and conveyed to the coating station. Examples 
of continuous liquefaction devices are found in U.S. 
Patent 5,182,190, PCT Publication WO 89/06829 and PCT 
Publication WO 92/09007. Dynamic continuous liquefaction equipment may 
damage or alter photographic materials due to mechanical  
 
energy from the pump or auger. Additionally, the close 
tolerance pumps typically used in dynamic liquefaction 
applications are subject to damage from foreign materials 
which may be present in the photographic materials, and 
will reduce overall machine reliability. Passive continuous liquefaction typically uses a 
flat coil or heating grid to liquefy material at the 
required coating rate. Liquefied gelatin passes through 
gaps between the coil or grid and is collected in a low 
volume reservoir. The reservoir may include an ultrasonic 
horn to enhance debubbling. The liquid level in the 
reservoir is monitored and used to control the heating 
rate of the coil or grid to maintain a constant rate of 
liquefaction. An example of such a passive liquefaction 
device can be found in U.S. Patent Application Serial 
Number 07/815,462. There exists a need to use both conventional and 
passive liquefaction technology in the same
</DESCRIPTION>
<CLAIMS>
An apparatus for melting a solid meltable 
material comprising: 

   a kettle having a volume bounded by a 
heatable wall and a drainage surface; and 

   an insert positionable within the volume of 
said kettle, said insert having an outer surface and pads 

attached to the outer surface wherein when said insert is 
positioned within the volume of said kettle, the outer 

surface is spaced apart from the heatable wall and the 
drainage surface by said pads to form a gap such that when 

solid meltable material is placed in the kettle containing 
said insert and the wall is heated, the material is melted 

and flows through the gap to the drainage surface. 
The device according to claim 1 further 
comprising: 

   a spray ring for heating the heatable wall. 
The device according to claim 1 wherein said 
outer surface of said insert includes an upper portion 

which is cone shaped. 
The device according to claim 3 wherein the 
cone shaped upper section is angled greater than the 

natural angle of repose of the solid material. 
The device according to claim 1 wherein said 
pads are integral with the outer surface of said insert. 
The device according to claim 1 wherein the 
gap formed by the insert, the wall and the drainage 

surface is sufficiently large to prevent bridging of the 
solid meltable material.
