<ABSTRACT>
In order to prevent relative movement between unwelded parts (12, 14) of a cross-over frog (16), the invention proposes that a sleeve (28) passes without play through the frog parts, a bolt (26) extending down the axis of the sleeve to connect the frog with its associated guardrails (18, 20).

<CLAIMS>
A rail section in the form of a frog (16) comprising two rail sections (12, 14) and 
guard rails (18, 20) held apart by liners (22, 24), where at least said frog is passed 

through by a sleeve (28) surrounding a connecting element such as a bolt (26) and 
where a non-positive connection between said frog, said liners and said guard rails is 

achieved via said connecting element,
wherein
 
said frog (16) comprises unwelded rails sections (12, 14) and wherein said rail 

sections and at least partially said liners are passed through without play by said 
sleeve (28).  

 
A rail section according to Claim 1,
wherein
 
said sleeve (28) is pressed or shrunk into the rail sections (12, 14) or liners 

(22,24). 
A rail section with a frog (60) comprising two rail sections (66, 68) and passed 
through at least in some areas by a connecting element such as a bolt (74) 

possibly surrounded by a sleeve and with guard rails (62, 64) associated with 
said frog (60) and holdable apart from one another by liners (70, 72), with a non-positive 

connection between said frog, said liners and said guard rails being 
achieved via said connecting element,
wherein
 
said frog (60) comprises unwelded frog sections (66, 68), and wherein said 

sections on the one hand and the liners (70, 72) arranged on both sides thereof 
holding apart said associated guard rails (62, 64) on the other hand positively 

engage with one another by profiling (82, 84, 86, 88, 90, 92) provided in the 
longitudinal direction of said frog, said profiling comprising a serration formed 

by teeth (82, 84, 86, 88, 90, 92) extending from contacting surfaces of said frog 
sections (66, 68) or frog sections (60) and of said liners (70, 72) and being in 

play-free contact with their tooth flanks (94, 96).  
 
A rail section according to Claim 3,
wherein
 
tooth head (81) and tooth foot (83) are held apart from one another by teeth 

engaging in one another. 
A rail section according to Claim 3,
wherein
 
the flank angle of said tooth flanks (94, 96) in relation to the central axis of said 

frog (60) or said guard rails (62, 64) describes an angle α of preferably 65° 
<
 α 

<
 75°, in particular α = 70°. 
A rail section according to at least one of the preceding claims,
wherein
 
the common plane (35, 37, 98, 100) of said guard rail heads (42, 44) and said 

liners (22, 24, 70, 72) in relation to said central axis (80) of said guard rails 
describes an angle β of preferably 65° 
<
 β 
<
 75°, in particular β = 70°. 
A rail section in the form of a frog area in accordance with one of the 
preceding claims, where said guard rails each have a guard rail head (42, 44) 

with guide surfaces (50, 52) facing said frog (16) for a wheel (54) passing the 
frog area,
wherein
 
said guide surfaces (50, 52) of said guard rail heads (42, 44) have a curvature 

matching the curvature of said wheel (54) passing said frog area. 
A rail section according to Claim 7,
wherein
 
a constant curvature difference applies in the contact area between said guide 

surface (50, 52) and said wheel (54), or a continually changing curvature 
difference in succeeding contact areas, in each case viewed in a plane medical to 

the longitudinal direction of said frog area.  
 
A rail section according to at least one of the preceding claims,
wherein
 
said liner (22) is composed of a block-like inner section (38, 40) extending from 

said frog (16) and passed through by said sleeve preferably completely without 
play, of a first wedge-shaped section (46, 48) tapering out in the direction of said 

guard rail head (42, 44), and of a second wedge-shaped section (34, 36) 
underneath said guard rail heard and supporting the latter in a common plane 

(35, 37). 
A rail section according to Claim 9 at least,
wherein
 
said first wedge-shaped section (46, 48) of said liner (22, 24) is provided on the 

guard rail head side with an outer surface (56, 58) that smoothly merges into the 
guide surface (50, 52) of said guard rail head (42, 44). 
A rail section according to at least one of the preceding claims,
wherein
 
said outer surface (56, 58) of said first wedge-shaped section (46, 48) of said 

liner (22, 24) has a curvature matched to that of said guide surface (50, 52) of 
said guard rail head.
