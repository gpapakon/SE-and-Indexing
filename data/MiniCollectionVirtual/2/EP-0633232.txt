<ABSTRACT>
Fused zirconia refractory materials have less 
content of SiO₂, high particle strength and hardness and 

advantageously less content of radioactive elements, 
particularly non-stabilized, partially or fully 

stabilized fused zirconia refractory materials obtained 
from desilicated zirconia derived from zircon. The 

refractory materials have 0.01 to 0.5 wt. % SiO₂, a 
crystal size of larger than 50 µm, particle strength of 

30 kgf, hardness of at least 10 GPa and preferably have a 
total amount of U and Th being below 1,000 ppm. 

Refractory products using said materials as well as 
methods for producing said materials by an electrofusion 

process are described.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a fused zirconia refractory 
material which may be used for producing heat-resistant and 
corrosion-resistant refractory products such as a long 
nozzle brick, tundish nozzle brick, submerged nozzle brick 
or sliding gate nozzle brick to be used in a continuous 
casting method, tundish furnace, ladle, crucible for 
melting metals or setter plate for annealing electronic 
part, or used for placing powder, ceramic pigment, 
abrasive, thermal spray powders used for thermal barrier or 
thermal spray powders of solid electrolyte, and 
particularly to a fused zirconia refractory material using 
a desilicated zirconia material made from zircon, a method 
for producing the same and a refractory product made with 
the same. Having the properties such as a high melting point of 
about 2700°C, high corrosion resistance and low thermal 
conductivity, zirconia(ZrO₂) has been generally used for 
refractory materials. Zirconium(Zr) has a wide distribution in the earth's 
crust. The proportion of zirconium is 0.026%, nearly equal 
to carbon and 2.5 times of Cu, 5 times of Zn, of general 
components of the earth's crust. Accordingly, zirconium is 
one of the elements to be used stably as an industrial  
 
material. Zr is obtained in the form of oxide, i.e. ZrO₂ - 
baddeleyite, in the form of a compound with SiO₂, i.e. 
ZrSiO₄ - zircon, or in the form of composite oxides with 
other elements. Used for industrial materials is 
zircon(zircon sand) or baddeleyite. ZrO₂ content in the zircon sand is as low as 67%, but 
the zircon sand distributes as a placer deposit in a wide 
region in the world, e.x. in Australia, South Africa, 
India, Malaysia, U.S.A. It is easy to mine and refine. 
Accordingly, it has been widely used as zirconia materials. The purity of ZrO₂ in baddeleyite being as high as 
96%, baddeleyite is a superior zirconia material of high 
quality. Main producing district is limited to South 
Africa and Brazil. Baddeleyite in Brazil, however, 
includes a high content of radioactive substances such as 
uranium(U), thorium(Th), etc. and an export restriction is 
made by the Brazilian government. Accordingly, the 
producing district is substantially limited to South 
Africa. Baddeleyite in South Africa, however, is not fully 
satisfactory for industrial materials in view of deposits, 
mining method, quality transition. Minerals including 
radioactive substances such as U, Th, etc. are separated by 
using the difference of gravity. By the reason of 
existence of residual radioactive
