<ABSTRACT>
An arrangement pertaining to electronic alarm systems of the kind used in goods monitoring systems includes an alarm element (1) that is adapted to receive a magnetic alternating field which is transmitted from a transmitter (2) by means of a transmitter coil (3) and whose frequency is swept, wherein the alarm element is adapted to retransmit a magnetic alternating field, and wherein a receiver (4) that includes a receiver coil (5) is adapted to receive and detect the retransmitted alternating field. The invention is characterized in that the system transmitter (2) is adapted for variation of the transmitted frequency; in that the system receiver (4) is adapted to receive and detect the occurrence of a signal from a disturbing other system; in that there is provided a control circuit (8) which is adapted to analyze the frequency and phase position of a signal transmitted from a disturbing system in relation to the frequency and phase position of the alternating field transmitted from the first system; and in that the control circuit (8) is adapted to deliver to the transmitter (2) of the first-mentioned system a control signal that displaces the transmitted frequency so that the first system is not disturbed by the disturbing signal.

<DESCRIPTION>
AN ARRANGEMENT RELATING TO ELECTRONIC ALARM SYSTEMS THAT DELIVER CONTROL SIGNALS SUCH AS TO DISPLACE THE SYSTEM TRANSMISSION FREQUENCY AND THEREWITH AVOID DISTURBANCESThe present invention relates to an arrangement pertaining to electronic alarm systems of the kind used in goods monitoring systems.Many different types of goods monitoring alarm systems are described in the patent literature. These systems are intended to prevent the removal of unpaid goods from stores and like shopping facilities. These alarm systems normally include some sort of alarm element that is fastened to the goods to be protected, and detection means that are permanently installed at store exits and that generate an alarm with the aid of remote sensors when goods carrying an alarm element are brought into the proximity of the store exit.Remote sensing is normally achieved by generating an alternating magnetic field in which the presence of an alarm element can be detected as a result of a change in the alternating field that is characteristic of the alarm element.The alarm element may have the form of a long, narrow and thin strip of highly permeable material whose characteristic property is found in the transmission of high order harmonics when exposed to a magnetic alternating field. This known basic principle enables the presence of narrow and inexpensive alarm elements to be detected with the aid of complicated and relatively expensive detection devices. This type of alarm system is particularly suited for use in daily shopping complexes and is described in European Patent Specification EP 0 153 286, among others. 

Known alarm elements can also consist of a simple electric resonance circuit. The detector arrangement can therewith be made relatively simple and inexpensive, provided that the coil in the resonance circuit is made relatively large and that a relatively good Q-value can be easily obtained together with a large coupling to an external field. In this regard, the coil is placed in an alarm plate which is fastened to the goods to be protected, with the aid of some kind of locking device.Such alarm systems may be constructed in a manner in which the detector arrangement includes two mutually spaced alarm arched coils that delimit the sensing zone. Several such alarm arches may be placed parallel with one another so as to form two or more parallel sensing zones.When large departmental stores and like service complexes include two or more mutually independent alarm systems of the kind that transmit on essentially the

CLAIMS
1. An arrangement pertaining to electronic alarm systems of the kind used in goods monitoring systems, wherein the alarm system includes an alarm element (1) that is adapted to receive a magnetic alternating field which is transmitted from a transmit¬ ter (2) by means of a transmitter coil (3) and whose frequency is swept, and wherein the alarm element is adapted to retransmit a magnetic alternating field, and wherein a receiver (4) that includes a receiver coil (5) is adapted to receive and detect the retransmitted alternating field, characterized in that the system transmitter (2) is adapted for variation of the transmitted frequency; in that the system receiver (4) is adapted to receive and detect the occurrence of a signal from a disturbing other system; in that there is provided a control circuit (8) which is adapted to analyze the frequency and phase position of a signal transmitted from a disturbing system in relation to the frequency and phase position of the alternating field transmitted from the first system; and in that the control circuit (8) is adapted to deliver to the transmitter (2) of the first-mentioned system a control signal which displaces the transmitted frequency so that the first system is not disturbed by the disturbing signal.
2. An arrangement according to Claim 1, characterized in that the control circuit (8) is adapted to send to the transmitter (2) of the first-mentioned system a control signal that displaces the transmitted frequency and causes the transmitter (2) to transmit an alternating field whose frequency and phase position coincide with the frequency and phase position of the received disturbing signal.
3. An arrangement according to Claim 1, characterized in that the control circuit (8) is adapted to send to the transmitter (2) of the first-mentioned system a control signal that displaces the 


transmitted frequency so that said frequency differs from the sweeping frequency of the disturbing signal by a difference frequency that is greater than the bandwidth of the signal that the first-mentioned system is intended to receive.
4. An arrangement according to Claim 1, 2 or 3, characterized in that the transmitter (2) includes a digital direct synthesis circuit to which the control signal is delivered, said digital circuit being adapted to digitally generate the frequency to be transmitted.
5. An arrangement according to Claim 1, 2, 3 or 4, character¬ ized in that the control circuit (8) includes a microprocessor which functions to carry out said analysis, preferably by means of a Fourier analysis; and in that the microprocessor is adapted to generate said control signal.
6. An arrangement according to Claim 4 or Claim 5, character¬ ized in that the digital direct synthesis circuit is designed so that its internal oscillator frequency can be influenced by said control signal.
