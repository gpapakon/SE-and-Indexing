 MICROCHANNEL COOLING OF FACE DOWN BONDED CHIPSThe United States government has rights in this invention pursuant to Contract Number W-7405-ENG-48 between the United States Department of Energy and the University of California for the operation of Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory.CROSS REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATION The present application is related to U.S. patent application entitledTHREE DIMENSIONAL, MULTI-CHIP MODULE, Serial No. , filed on the same day as the present application, and owned at the time of invention and currently by the same assignee.BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION Field of the InventionThe present invention relates to cooling high power integrated circuits; and particularly to microchannel cooling of integrated circuits bonded face down on circuit boards, such as by flip-chip bonding.Description of the Related ArtMany computer systems rely on so-called flip-chip bonding of die for electrical and mechanical attachment of integrated circuit chips to circuit boards. See, Goldman, et al., "Area Array Solder Interconnections for VLSI", SOLID STATE TECHNOLOGY, June, 1983, pp. 91-97. In flip- chip bonds, the integrated circuits are mounted face down on the circuit board. Solder bumps are coupled to bonding sites on the integrated circuits and corresponding bonding sites on the circuit board. The principal advantages of flip-chip bonding are a relative lack of electrical parasitics associated with the electrical connection, relatively high I/O available (in principal, at least), and repairability by removal and replacement of the chips. On the other hand, a significant difficulty is 

encountered in cooling fiip-chip mounted chips. The solder bumps cover only a small fraction of the surface of the chip, and the underlying circuit boards are usually poor thermal conductors.Heat is removed from commercial flip-chip systems using so-called thermal conduction module or TCM, such as described in the Goldman, et al. article cited above. However, the thermal conduction modules are very complex mechanically, and can only remove limited amounts of heat. As the power dissipated by integrated circuits increases, it is expected that the thermal conduction module technology will be insufficient.One integrated circuit cooling technology which is capable of removing large amounts of heat is known as microchannel cooling. MicroChannel cooling is described in detail in Tuckerman, et al., "High- Performance Heat Sinking for VLSI", IEEE ELECTRON DEVICE LETTERS, Vol. EDL-2, No. 5, May, 1981, pp. 126-129;
