<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a toner for
electrophotography. More specifically, it relates to a
toner for electrophotography, which has hydrolyzability and
biodegradability and permits facile deinking (removal of
ink) with an existing deinking system, and which can be
easily waste-treated.In recent years, with a view to both environmental
protection and waste treatment, i.e., the protection of
forest resources and the prevention of global warming, it is
actively promoted worldwide to use waste paper. For
promoting the use of waster paper, there are methods in
which the content of a deinked pulp in reclaimed paper is
increased and the process of incorporating a deinked pulp
into woodfree paper and paper for information industry is
developed. For this purpose, it is required to improve the
quality of a deinked pulp obtained from waste paper from
printed matter such as newspaper, magazines, and the like,
by increasing the deinking ratio and dustproof ratio of the
deinked pulp.Meanwhile, copying machines and printers using
electrophotographic systems are now widely used, and the
waste of used copying paper is increasing in amount. It has
been therefore proposed to attempt to obtain a deinked pulp
from used copying paper. In copying paper, however, a toner
composed mainly of a colorant and a binder resin is strongly
adhered to a paper surface, and it is difficult to
regenerate a high-quality deinked pulp by a conventional 
deinking treatment method.In view of the protection of global environment,
the safety of waste is also an important issue. In Italy, a
tax on non-decomposable shipping bags has been enforced
since 1987 for overcoming the problem of plastic waste, and
a law has been issued which provides that shopping bags
and bottles are to be produced from biodegradable
materials from 1991 onward. Further, regulations against
the use of plastics or bills for the conversion of materials
to decomposable polymers are studied in other European
countries and some States of the U.S.A.Under the circumstances, developments of
biodegradable resins are now under way, and biodegradable
resins for medical materials have been put to practical use
to a considerable extent. In the field of agriculture,
biodegradable materials are practically used as multifiles,
sustained-releasable agrochemicals, fertilizers and
gardening tools. In leisure industry, some of fishing
lines, fishing tackle and tees for golfing are practically
produced from biodegradable materials. Further, some of
packaging materials for daily
