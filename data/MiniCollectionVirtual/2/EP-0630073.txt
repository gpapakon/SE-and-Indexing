<ABSTRACT>
A double collar portion formed on a rubber plug 
intermediate opposite ends thereof and an umbrella-shaped 

end plug formed at a rear end of the rubber plug improve 
waterproofing in an electrical terminal. The collar 

portion is held in intimate contact with an inner 
peripheral surface of a tubular terminal-receiving chamber 

to form a seal therebetween. An open end of the tubular 
terminal-receiving chamber is closed by the end plug 

without a gap or recess, thereby eliminating the 
possibility of collection of water and virtually 

eliminating the possibility of water leaking into the 
terminal.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a rubber plug for a waterproof
connector and more particularly to a rubber plug
wherein the plug forms a seal between a housing and a wire
within the waterproof connector.One known rubber plug for a waterproof connector is
shown in Figs. 4 and 5. A rubber plug 2 of a cylindrical
shape having a through hole 2a extending along a centerline
thereof for passing a wire 1 therethrough has two
flange-like collars 2b formed at a rear end portion 7
thereof. A front end portion 5 of the rubber plug has an
outer diameter such that the front end portion 5 can be
compressively clamped by an insulation barrel 3a of a terminal
3 with the wire 1 passing through the front end portion
5.On the other hand, a connector housing 4 (Fig. 5) has a
tubular terminal-receiving chamber 4a for retaining and
holding the terminal at its front portion 8, the terminal
receiving chamber having an open rear end portion 9. The
open rear end portion 9 has a diameter such that the collars
2b are held in tight contact with the peripheral wall
when the rubber plug 2 and the wire 1 are inserted into the
housing 4.The wire 1 is passed through the through hole 2a of the
rubber plug 2, and a covering or insulating material is
peeled from the front end portion 5 of the wire. The front
end portion 5 of the rubber plug 2 is fixedly secured to
the insulation barrel 3a of the terminal 3 by compressive
clamping, and a conductor or exposed portion of the wire 1
is connected to a wire barrel 6 of the terminal 3 by compressive
clamping. When the terminal 3 is inserted into the
terminal receiving chamber 4a of the connector housing 4, 
the terminal 3 defining the leading side is retained at the
inner end portion of the terminal receiving chamber 4a, and
the rubber plug 2 at the rear end 9 of the terminal is received
in the terminal receiving chamber 4a in intimate
contact with the peripheral wall of the chamber, with the
collars 2b being slightly elastically deformed.When water is poured on the open end 9 of the terminal
receiving chamber 4a, the intrusion of the water is prevented
because of the intimate contact between the peripheral
wall of the terminal receiving chamber 4a and the collars
2b of the rubber plug 2, thereby achieving a waterproof
effect.In the above conventional rubber plug for a waterproof
connector, however, if the rear end face 7 of the rubber
plug 2 is not flush with the open end of the terminal receiving
chamber 4a, a water collecting recess R may be
formed. In such a case, when the wire vibrates, although

<CLAIMS>
A waterproof connector having a rubber plug, said
rubber plug (10) comprising a wire (20) passed therethrough,

said rubber plug (10) together with said wire (20)
being insertable into a tubular passage (41) of the waterproof

connector to form a seal between a wall of said tubular
passage (41) and said wire (20), said rubber plug (10)

having:

a main plug portion (12) that forms said seal between
said wire (20) and said tubular passage (41) by means of a

pair of flange-like collars (13) being held in intimate
contact with the inner peripheral surface of said tubular

passage (41), and
an end plug (14) portion connected to said main plug portion
(12) at a side of the connector where an open end (43) of

said tubular passage (41) is disposed, said end plug (14)
closing said open end (43), wherein
said end plug (14) has a lip portion, said lip portion
being tapered such that its diameter progressively increases

away from said flange-like collars (13).
The waterproof connector of claim 1, wherein said
tapered end plug (14) has a first portion having a diameter

greater than a diameter of said pair of flange-like collars
(13) and a diameter of the tubular passage (41), a second

portion having a diameter equal to both the diameter of the
tubular passage (41) and the diameter of the pair of

flange-like collars (13) in the tubular passage (41), and a
third portion having a diameter less than the diameter of

the tubular passage (41) and the diameter of the pair of
flange-like collars (13).
The waterproof connector of claim 1 or 2, wherein
said main plug (12) and said end plug (14) are a unitary

structure. 
The waterproof connector of anyone of claims 1 to
3, wherein said tapered end plug (14) is pressed into intimate

contact against said open end (43) of said tubular
passage (41) to maintain a tight seal.
A rubber plug for a waterproof connector, comprising
a main plug portion (12) that forms a seal between a

wire (20) and a tubular passage (41) inside the waterproof
connector by means of a pair of flange-like collars (13)

being held in intimate contact with the inner peripheral
surface of said tubular passage (41), and


an end plug (14) portion connected to said main plug portion
(12) at a side of the connector where an open end (43) of

said tubular passage (41) is disposed, said end plug (14)
closing said open end (43), wherein
said end plug (14) has a lip portion, said lip portion
being tapered such that its diameter progressively increases

away from said flange-like collars (13).
The rubber plug of claim 5, wherein said tapered
end plug (14) has a first portion having a diameter greater

than a diameter of said pair of flange-like collars (13)
and a diameter of the tubular passage (41), a second portion

having a diameter equal to both the diameter of the
tubular passage (41) and the diameter of the pair of

flange-like collars (13) in the tubular passage (41), and a
third portion having a diameter less than the diameter of

the tubular passage (41) and the diameter of the pair of
flange-like collars (13).
The rubber plug claim 5 or 6, wherein said main
