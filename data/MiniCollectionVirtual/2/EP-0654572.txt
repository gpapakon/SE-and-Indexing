<ABSTRACT>
A lock piece is provided in the inner part of a 
tumbler. Size of a clearance formed between the side of a lock 

groove engaging portion of the lock piece and the side of a 
lock groove is determined to be smaller than size of a 

clearance formed between the side of a lock condition holding 
portion of the tumbler and the side of a lock groove. When the 

key is inserted being given a torque in the rotating direction, 
the lock groove engaging portion is engaged with the side of 

the lock groove, and the lock condition holding portion of the 
tumbler is maintained to be separate from the side of the lock 

groove. Due to the foregoing, the lock condition holding 
portion is prevented from being caught on the side of the lock 

groove.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a cylinder lock comprising a
rotor case provided with a lock groove in the inner
circumferential portion thereof, a rotor rotatably accommodated
in the rotor case, the rotor having a keyhole extending in the
axial direction and a tumbler insertion hole extending in the
radial direction, at least one tumbler movably inserted into
the tumbler insertion hole of the rotor, the tumbler including
at least one lock condition holding portion for holding the
rotor in a lock condition and at least one lock condition
release portion for releasing said rotor.Such a cylinder lock is known from FR-A-1 493 687.Conventionally, in this type cylinder lock, tumblers
are movably inserted into a plurality of tumbler insertion
holes provided in the rotor, and when a key is not inserted
into the keyhole, a lock condition holding portion of each
tumbler is engaged with a lock groove in the rotor case, so
that the rotor can be maintained in a lock condition.According to the device described above, when the key
is inserted into the keyhole, a protruding and cutout portion
of the key is engaged with the lock condition release member of
the tumbler. In the process of insertion of the key, each
tumbler is pushed upward or downward along the protruding and
cutout portion of the key. After the completion of key
inserting operation, the protruding and cutout portion of the
key is engaged with a predetermined lock condition release
portion of the tumbler, and the tumbler is moved so that the
lock condition holding portion can be released from the lock
groove. Next, the key is operated so as to rotate the rotor.In this connection, when an operator inserts the key
into the keyhole, he is well aware of the rotational operation 
of the key to be conducted after the insertion of the key.
Therefore, he tends to insert the key into the keyhole while a
torque is applied to the key. However, in the conventional
construction described above, when the key is inserted into the
keyhole while a torque is applied to the key, the tumblers
which are pushed upward or downward come into pressure contact
with a side of the lock groove. Therefore, even after the key
inserting operation has been completed, the tumblers can not be
moved due to a frictional force generated between the tumblers
and the side of the lock groove. For this reason, there is a
possibility that the lock condition holding portion is not
disengaged from the lock groove. When the lock condition
holding portion is not disengaged from the lock groove, the

<CLAIMS>
A cylinder lock comprising:

a rotor case (1) provided with a lock groove (1a) in the inner circumferential
portion thereof;
a rotor (2) rotatably accommodated in the rotor case (1), the rotor (2) having a
keyhole (2a) extending in the axial direction and a tumbler insertion hole (2b)

extending in the radial direction;
at least one tumbler (5,6) movably inserted into the tumbler insertion hole (2b) of
the rotor (2), the tumbler (5,6) including:
at least one lock condition holding portion (5b,6b) for holding the rotor (2) in a lock
condition and at least one lock condition release portion (5d,6d) for releasing said

rotor (2),
characterized in that
said lock condition holding portion (5b,6b) is adapted to engage with the lock
groove (1a) of the rotor case (1) when a key (4) is not inserted into the keyhole

(2a);
that said lock condition release portion (5d,6d) is provided in the tumbler (5,6), the
lock condition release portion (5d,6d) allowing the tumbler (5,6) to move so as to

disengage the lock condition holding portion (5b,6b) from the lock groove (1a)
when the key (4) is inserted into the keyhole (2a) with the lock condition release

portion (5d,6d) being engaged with a protruding and cutout portion (4a) of the key
(4); and
a lock piece (8) is movably provided in the rotor (2), the lock piece (8) being
located in the inner part of the tumbler (5,6), the lock piece (8) including:
rotor position holding means (29,9,10) for holding the rotor (2) in a predetermined
portion when the key (4) is not inserted into the keyhole (2a).
A cylinder lock as claimed in claim 1, wherein the rotor position holding means (2g,9,10)
includes a lock groove engaging portion (8b) engaging with the lock groove (1a) of the rotor

case (1). 
A cylinder lock as claimed in claim 2, wherein a clearance (D1) between the side
of the lock groove engaging portion (8b) of the lock
 piece (8) and the side of the
lock groove (1a) is determined to be smaller than a clearance (D2) between the

side of the lock condition holding portion (5b) and the side of the lock groove (1a)
so as to hold the lock condition holding portion (5b) of the tumbler (5,6) to be

separate from the side of the lock groove (1a) when the rotor (2) is rotated under
a lock condition.
A cylinder lock as claimed in claim 1, wherein a lock piece moving portion (8d) is
provided at least at one end of the key (4) and the lock piece (8), and the lock

piece moving portion (8d) forcibly moves from the lock groove engaging portion
(8b) coming into contact with the side of the lock groove (1a) so as to disengage

the lock groove engaging portion (8b) from the lock groove (1a) when the key (4)
is inserted into the keyhole (2a).
