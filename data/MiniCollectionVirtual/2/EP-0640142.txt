<ABSTRACT>
This invention relates to Streptomyces avermitilis lacking branched-chain amino acid transaminase activity, branched-chain 2-oxo acid biosynthetic activity and, optionally and preferably, avermectin B-O-methyl transferase activity, methods for preparation thereof, and use thereof to produce natural and non-natural avermectins from branched-chain fatty acid or branched-chain 2-oxo acid precursors. Such avermectins are useful as parasiticides.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to strains of Streptomycesavermitilis lacking branched-chain
amino acid transaminase activity (ilvE) and branched-chain 2-oxo acid biosynthetic
activity ("early ilv"), and, optionally and preferably, lacking avermectin B-O-methyl
transferase activity, to methods for producing said S. avermitilis and to the use of S.
avermitilis to produce natural and non-natural avermectins using branched-chain fatty
acid or branched-chain 2-oxo acid compounds, or derivatives or precursors thereof.U.S. Patents 4,310,519 and 4,429,042 describe the avermectins, a complex of
related agents having potent antiparasitic activity, and their production by aerobic
fermentation of strains of Sfreptomyces avermitilis; namely, S. avermitilis ATCC Nos.
31267, 31271 and 31272. The last two strains cited represent a frozen vial and a
lyophilized tube, respectively of a culture obtained by ultraviolet irradiation of S.
avermitilis ATCC 31267.EP 214,731, published March 18, 1987, the counterpart of U.S. patent
application Serial No. 886,867, filed July 16, 1986, discloses, interalia, a number of
compounds (referred to herein as non-natural avermectins) related to the natural or
known avermectins but having novel substituent groups at the 25-position, a process
for their preparation by fermentation of an avermectin producing organism in the
presence of certain specified carboxylic acids, or derivatives or precursors thereof, and
compositions and methods for treating and preventing insect or parasite infections or
infestations comprising such non-natural avermectins. The S. avermitilis organisms
used to produce the said novel C-25 substituted avermectins are S. avermitilis ATCC
31267, 31271, 31272 and NCIB 12121. The latter organism, described in EP 214,731,
is derived from S. avermitilis ATCC 31271. It gives improved yields of the novel C-25
substituted avermectins when it is cultured in a semi-defined medium. Each of ATCC
31267, 31271, 31272 and NCIB 12121 may also produce, in addition to the novel C-25
substituted derivative, varying amounts of the known, or natural, avermectins wherein
the 25-substituent is isopropyl or (S)-sec-butyl (1-methylpropyl).The carbon skeleton of the avermectins (depicted in formula (I) below) is derived
from acetate and propionate precursors and the C-25 substituent of natural avermectins
from L-isoleucine (R=(S)-sec-butyl) or L-valine (R=isopropyl) (Fisher and Mrozik,
"Macrolide Antibiotics", Academic Press (1984) Ch. 14). By "known" or "natural" avermectins is meant those
