<ABSTRACT>
A standby circuit for electrical consumers contains a detector (4), by means of which a decoder (3) is switched on once an infrared signal, emitted by a remote control, has been detected. If a command, contained in the infrared signal, for switching on is recognised by the decoder (3), a switched-mode power supply (1) feeding the consumer is switched on. During standby operation, current is consumed only by the detector (4), which is implemented to have a high resistance, with the result that the power loss is in the milliwatt range.

A standby circuit for electrical consumers
containing a detector device (4), by which a signal

emitted by a remote control can be received, a
decoding device (3), by which the signal emitted by

the remote control is decoded and which is switched
off during a standby phase and switched on when a

received signal is ascertained by the detector
device (4), and a power supply for the consumer

which is switched on when a command for switching on
the power supply is ascertained by the decoder

device (3), having a power converter (1), from the
primary side of which the detector device (4) is

supplied and from the secondary side of which the
decoder device (3) is supplied and which is switched

into a state in which the decoder device (3) is
supplied with power when the received signal is

ascertained by the detector device (4),
characterised in that
 a further detector device (9),
by which a signal emitted by the remote control can

be received, is supplied from the secondary side of
the power converter (1)
and in that
 an output signal of the further detector
device (9) is supplied to the decoder device (3) for

decoding.
A standby circuit according to Claim 1,
characterised in that
 the detector device (3) is
supplied by an energy storage device (34), which is

recharged from the secondary side of the power
converter (1). 
A standby circuit according to Claim 2,
characterised in that
 the energy storage device is
a capacitor (34)
in that
 the detector device (4) generates a voltage
monitoring signal by which the part of the power

converter (1) feeding the detector device (4) is
switched on when a minimum voltage is fallen short

of, and by which the power converter (1) can be
switched off when a set voltage is reached.
A standby circuit according to Claim 1,
characterised in that
 the detector device (3) is
supplied by a voltage divider (43, 44, 45) and by a

rectifier device (46, 47, 48) from a current path
which is switched between the connection for an

alternating voltage fed into the primary side of the
power converter (1) and a reference connection (33)

of the secondary side of the power converter (1).
A standby circuit according to one of Claims 1 to 4,
characterised in that
 the detector device (4)
contains:


a bipolar transistor (63), the emitter-collector
section of which is switched between

an input connection (61) and an output
connection (62),
a resistance element (64) switched between
emitter and base of the bipolar transistor (63)

and
a light-sensitive switching element (65), which
comprises a first connection for a reference

potential and a second connection, which is 
coupled to the base of the bipolar transistor

(63).
A standby circuit according to Claim 5,
characterised in that
 the detector device (3)
contains at least one signal amplifying device (67,

68) having a high pass property, the input-output
signal path of which is switched between the second

connection of the light-sensitive switching element
(65) and the base of the bipolar transistor (63).
A standby circuit according to Claim 6,
characterised in that
 an integrating circuit (82,
83, 80) is switched between the base of the bipolar

transistor (63) and the connection for the reference
potential (60).
A standby circuit according to one of Claims 1 to 4,
characterised in that
 the power converter (1) is a
switched mode power supply which contains a control

device (12) for controlling the operational states
of the switched mode power supply and a transformer

(10).
