<ABSTRACT>
A process for applying a metal coating to a nonconductive 
substrate without an electroless coating is disclosed. The process 

includes the step of: 

a. contacting said substrate with an activator comprising 
a noble metal/Group IVA metal sol to obtain a 

treated substrate; 
b. contacting said treated substrate with a self accelerating 
and replenishing immersion metal composition 

comprising a solution of: 

(i) a soluble metal salt whose metal is more noble 
than said Group IVA metal; 
(ii) a Group I A metal hydroxide; 
(iii) a complexing agent comprising an organic material 
having a cumulative formation constant 

log K of from about 0.73 to about 21.95 for an 
ion of the metal of said metal salt. 
The Group IVA metal is employed in a stoichiometric excess 
compared to the nobel metal, the excess Group IVA metal being in 

its lowest oxidation state. 
Self accelerating and replenishing non-formaldehyde immersion 
metal compositions are also disclosed.  
The composition is used in a two step process to electrolytically 
coat a nonconductive substrate. In the first step the conductivity 

of the substrate is increased by applying the composition 
to it. In the second step, the substrate treated with the 

composition is electrolytically coated with a metal.

<DESCRIPTION>
The field of the invention is the electrometallization of
non-metallic substrates without using an electroless metal coating.
In one embodiment, the invention relates to circuit boards
and a method for improving the manufacture of such boards by
eliminating electroless plating of the boards and effecting
through-hole plating and/or directly forming circuits thereon by
an electrolytically deposited metal coating. A novel coating process
is disclosed for this process.Many processes are known for the formation of metal coatings
on non-metallic substrates either for decorative or functional
purposes. One of the more commercially important uses of such
coatings is in the manufacture of printed circuit boards. Printed
circuit boards (PCB's) comprise, for example, a rigid
non-conducting or dielectric base made up of a fibrous material
such as glass fibers, paper and the like in combination with a
polymer such as an epoxy resin, and a conductive metal layer such
as copper on either one or both surfaces. Multilayer boards
(MLB's) comprise several PCB's laminated to one another by means
of an adhesive. In addition to rigid boards (as described above),
flexible boards can be produced employing thermoplastic dielectric 
layers such as fluorocarbon polymers, Nylon polymers, polyimides,
Kevlarâ„¢ reinforced polymers, polyparabanic acids and polyesters.
Flexible boards are manufactured without fiber reinforcing. Production
of both of these types of printed circuit boards are described
in Printed Circuits Handbook, Second Edition, edited by C.
F. Coombs, Jr., McGraw-Hill, 1979.Laminated combinations of flexible and rigid boards
are also finding utility in some applications for MLB's.In the manufacture of PCB's, a metal conductive foil such as
copper is bonded to the circuit board, although any metal may be
applied to a non-conductive dielectric circuit board as a foil or
by electro deposition or electroless deposition.Prior to laminating inner layers to form an MLB, the metal
surface is treated in an art known manner to produce electrically
conductive lines (circuits) for the transfer of current between
components of an electric circuit, the components comprising by
way of example diodes, transistors, resistors, capacitors and the
like. The circuits may be formed either by a positive or a negative
working photoresist, silk screen resist or hand painted resist
process followed by etching and in some instances, electrodeposition
of a metal or metals, all of which is known in the
art.In forming MLB's by laminating, an
