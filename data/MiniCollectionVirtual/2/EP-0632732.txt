Liquid drug infusion pump, of the type comprising at 
least one device, with cylinder and plunger, for aspirating 

a liquid from a container and delivering it to a tube 
connected to the patient, characterized in that it 

comprises : 

a first member (4) in which is arranged at least one 
metering cylinder (5) which, containing a plunger (22, 23) 

actuated by a reciprocating movement, opens into one of the 
surfaces of the member, perpendicularly to that surface, 
a second member (6) which, supported on the surface of 
the first member (4) into which each cylinder (5) opens, 

comprises, opposite each cylinder, a recess (13) whose 
diameter is greater than that of the corresponding cylinder 

and which communicates with a liquid supply container, 
a sealed and resiliently deformable membrane (18) 
sandwiched between the two members (4, 6) and comprising an 

aperture (19) opposite each cylinder (5), 
a disc (14) housed in each recess (13) of the second 
member (6), whose surface facing the first member (4) is 

staggered and comprises an external section supported, via 
the membrane, on the surface of the first member into which 

the corresponding cylinder opens, exactly round this 
cylinder, and a central section (15) projecting on the 

cylinder interior side, this disc comprising through-holes 
(16) which are regularly distributed and arranged adjacent 

to its periphery, 
a spring (17) exerting a pressure on the disc in the 
direction of the first member, and  

 
associated with each cylinder (5), a port (10) opening 
into the same surface of the first member (4) as the 

cylinder (5) in question, this port (10) being associated 
with a discharge tube (12) arranged in this member, being 

arranged adjacent to the cylinder (5), opposite the same 
recess 
(13) as this cylinder, but on the other side of the 
disc (14) which this recess contains, and being covered by 

the membrane (18) sandwiched between the two members. 
Pump according to Claim 1, characterized in that the 
disc (14), arranged in the recess (13) of the second member 

(6), comprises a cylindrical section of large diameter, 
prolonged in its central section and on the metering 

cylinder side by a cylindrical section (15) with a smaller 
diameter than the cylinder (5), the through-holes (16) 

being arranged in the external section and opening opposite 
the cylinder (5). 
Pump according to one of Claims 1 and 2, characterized 
in that it comprises a third member (7), in contact with 

the first member (4) on the side opposite the second member 
(6) and comprising bores (8) prolonging the cylinders (5) 

of the first member, a sealing membrane (20) being 
sandwiched between the first and third members (4, 7), the 

plunger of each pump comprising two sections (22, 23) 
assembled one to the other and arranged either side of the 

sealing membrane (20), the section (22) located in the 
cylinder being made of a material that is compatible with 

the liquid to be conveyed and the other section (23) being 
intended for the fixing of the means (9) by which the 

plunger is actuated. 
Pump according to Claim 3, characterized in that the 
section (23) of the plunger located on the side facing the 

third member (7) is made of a ferro-magnetic material, 
intended for fixing to the magnetized end of a movement 

actuation rod (9).  
 
Pump according to one of Claims 3 and 4, characterized 
in that each of the two sections (22, 23) of the plunger 

has a section which narrows from its free end towards its 
end fixed to the other section. 
Pump according to Claim 5, characterized in that the 
sealing membrane (20) is pre-formed so that, prior to its 

assembly, at the level of each plunger it has a hollow-profile 
section corresponding to that of an inclined zone 

of a plunger section and of the assembly zone of the two 
plunger sections. 
Pump according to one of Claims 1 to 6, characterized 
in that it comprises lugs or other distance pieces forming 

spacer wedges between the first and second members in order 
to gauge the crushing of the membrane arranged between 

them. 
Pump according to one of Claims 3 to 7, characterized 
in that the three members (4, 6, 7) and their intermediate 

membranes are assembled the ones on the others and form an 
independent functional case (3) intended to be immovably 

mounted on a box (2) for controlling and actuating the 
plungers. 
Pump according to Claim 8, characterized in that it 
comprises discriminating elements associated with the means 

of assembling the box and the case containing the 
cylinders.
