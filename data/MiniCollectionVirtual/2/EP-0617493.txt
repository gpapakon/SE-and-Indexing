<ABSTRACT>
A connection device (3) for grid-like channels (1, 2) comprises a sheet-metal plate (9) which is bent in the form of a V and contains a bore (12) in the centre, between the strips (11) which are obtained by bending-off. Seated in the bore (12) is a hammer-head bolt (14) with a rotation-prevention means (21). The shank (13) of the hammer-head bolt (14) defines the distance between the grid-like channels (1, 2) at the joint and, due to the shape of the head of the hammer-head bolt (14), it is possible at any point in time to introduce the head (15) and the shank (13) of the hammer-head bolt (14) between the adjacent wires (6) of the grid-like channels (1, 2) to be connected. Preliminary mounting of the connection device (3) is thus possible, and all that needs to be done at the mounting location is to tighten the nut (27) of the hammer-head bolt (14) after the connection device (3) has been fitted to the joint.

Connection means (3) for connecting adjacent lattice 
ducts (1, 2), which are arranged to abut against each 

other at the connection and have a wire (5) curved in 
keeping with the profile of the lattice duct on their 

face side adjacent to the abutment, 

with a connection plate (9), which carries two 
parallel straight fillets (11) spaced from one another 

which form a C-shaped profile together with the 
connection plate (9), and contains an opening (12) in 

the centre between the fillets (11), wherein the clear 
space between the fillets (11) is equal to the 

distance between the wires (5) on the face side 
adjacent to the abutment, measured over both wires 

(5), 
with a hammer-head bolt (14), which has an elongated 
head (15), a threaded shank (13) as well as a rotation 

locking means (21), said threaded shank (13) as well 
as the rotation locking means (21) having an active 

diameter equal to the desired distance between the 
lattice ducts (1, 2), and when the threaded shank (13) 

is inserted in the opening (12), the head (15) lies on 
the same side of the connection plate (9) as the 

fillets (11), and 
with a nut (27) screwed onto the threaded shank. 
Means according to Claim 1, wherein the nut (27) is a 
self-locking nut. 
Means according to Claim 1, wherein two tongues are 
additionally formed on the connection plate (9) which  

 
are located with the hole (12) on a straight line. 
Connection means (3) for connecting adjacent lattice 
ducts (1, 2), which are arranged to abut against each 

other at the connection and have a wire (5) curved in 
keeping with the profile of the lattice duct on their 

face side adjacent to the abutment, 

with a connection plate (9) made of a bent metal 
sheet (8), 
with an abutment surface for the wires (5), 
with two parallel straight fillets (11) spaced from 
one another which form a C-shaped profile together 

with the connection plate (9) and their clear space 
from one another is equal to the distance between the 

wires (5) on the face side adjacent to the abutment, 
measured over both wires, 
with two tongues (31) spaced from one another which 
are arranged centrally between the fillets (11) and 

extend in the same direction of the fillets (11), 
wherein the clear space between one fillet (11) and 

the adjacent edge (32) of the tongue (31) is equal to 
the diameter of the wire, and the width of each tongue 

(31) is equal to the desired distance between adjacent 
lattice ducts (1, 2), measured in a direction parallel 

to the space between the fillets (11), and 
with bending elements (11), which may be at least 
partially bent over around the respective wires (5) at 

the point of abutment to secure the connecting element 
(3) on the lattice ducts (1, 2). 
Connection means according to Claim 4, wherein the 
bending elements are formed by extensions of the 

fillets (11). 
Connection means according to Claim 1 or 4, 
characterised in that the fillets (11) and the 

connection plate (9) are formed from a Single 
bent metal sheet part (8). 
Connection means according to Claim 1 or 4, 
characterised in that the height of the fillets (11) 

above the abutment surface of the connection plate (9) 
is at least equal to half the diameter of the wire. 
Connection means according to Claim 4, characterised 
in that the connection plate (9) has two tongues (31). 
Connection means according to Claim 1, characterised 
in that the rotation locking means (21) has the shape 

of a square, which is rounded on two diametrically 
opposed corners, wherein the radius of curvature 

corresponds to the radius of the threaded shank.
