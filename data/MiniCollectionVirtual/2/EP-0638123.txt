<DESCRIPTION>
THIS INVENTION relates to the control of neoplastic tissue growth and is particularly concerned with the provision of new anti-tumour agents and with enzymes capable of converting prodrugs into anti-tumour agents.The alkylating agent 5-(aziridin-1-yl)-2,4-dinitrobenzamide (hereinafter designated CB 1954) has been known, almost for 20 years, as an interesting experimental compound of unique selectivity. Although CB 1954 is structurally quite closely related to numerous other known alkylating agents which have a relatively broad range of activity, CB 1954 exhibits considerable activity against the Walker tumour cells invivo or invitro but was thought to be virtually inactive against other tumours.It was recently discovered that the selectivity of CB 1954 arose from the fact that it was not an anti-tumour agent perse but was a prodrug for an anti-tumour agent generated from CB 1954 by a nitroreductase enzyme found in the Walker cell. This nitroreductase from the Walker cell was subsequently shown to be an enzyme known from other sources which was an NAD(P)H dehydrogenase (quinone) classified as EC.1.6.99.2, see Robertson etal, J. Biol. Chem. 261, 15794-15799 (1986).In the course of the previous investigations with CB 1954, it was found that the Walker cell enzyme EC.1.6.99.2 had the ability to reduce the 4-nitro group of CB 1954 to the corresponding hydroxylamine and that it was the resulting 5-(aziridin-1-yl)-2-nitro-4-hydroxylamino-benzamide that was the active anti-tumour agent.The use of prodrugs represents a clinically very valuable concept in cancer therapy since, particularly where the prodrug is to be converted to an anti-tumour agent under the influence of an enzyme that is linkable to a monoclonal antibody that will bind to a tumour associated antigen, the combination of such a prodrug with such an enzyme monoclonal/antibody conjugate represents a very powerful clinical agent.EP-A-0 330 432; Knox et al., Biochem. Pharm., Vol. 37, No. 24, pp. 4671-4677; and Knox et al., Biochem. Pharm., Vol. 37, No. 24, pp. 4661-4669, each describe the compound CB1954 (5-(aziridin-1-yl)-2,4-dinitrobenzamide) and the nitroreductase (NR) enzyme from Walker tumour cells, and the discovery that CB 1954 is acted upon by the nitroreductase (NR) enzyme found in Walker tumour cells, to yield an especially active species, the 4-hydroxylamino analog.Bryant et al., (J. Biol. Chem., Vol. 266, No. 7, pp. 4126-4130) describes the cloning, nucleotide sequence, and expression in E. coli. of a nitroreductase gene from Enterobacter
