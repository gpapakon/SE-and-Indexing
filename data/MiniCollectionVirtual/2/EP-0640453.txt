<ABSTRACT>
A device and a method of refinishing a workpiece, in particular a concrete pipe, are described. The refinishing is effected while bringing a flexible structure of a length corresponding to at least half the circumference of the workpiece into contact with the workpiece, a cutting tool being held at a constant distance from the centre between two points, opposite one another upon contact of the flexible structure with the workpiece, on the flexible structure.
