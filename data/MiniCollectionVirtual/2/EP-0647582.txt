<ABSTRACT>
The transport clamps (16) driven in the conveying direction (F) hold the printed products (26) in the region of their fold (28). Underneath the conveying means (10) there is a supporting element (38) which supports the printed products in their edge region (44) and with the leading edge (34). Arranged on rotating supporting arms (70) are opening elements (22) resembling suction heads, which, as a result of the inward pivoting of the supporting arms (70), engage in each case between two printed products (26) and come to bear from above on the edge region (44) of the printed product to be opened. Mounted on the hollow shaft (48) is a suction roller, of which a suction head (50) comes to bear in each case on the edge region (44) from below. The opening element (72) and the suction roller (46) retain respectively the first and second product part (30, 32) of the printed product for the purpose of opening the printed product (26) and lift these off from one another, after which a keeping-open element (102) moves from below between the product parts (30, 32) in order to keep the printed product (26) open during further transport.

transporting folded printing products, having:- a 

Conveying device (10) with transporting clips (16) 
which are driven in conveying direction (F), are 

arranged at intervals one behind the other and are 
designed for holding the printing products (26) while 

suspended at their fold (28), which runs transversely 
to the conveying direction (F) and joins two product 

parts (30, 32) to each other; a supporting element (38) 
which is arranged below the conveying device (10), 

forms a conveying plane (38') acting substantially in 
conveying direction (F) and is for supporting the 

printing products (26) at their border region (44), 
which is opposite the fold (28) and bent forward in 

conveying direction (F); and an opening unit (36) which 
is likewise arranged below the conveying device (10), 

is driven in time with the conveying device (10) and 
has an opening element (72), which circulates along a 

closed path of movement (97), is intended to engage 
above the supporting element (38) between two 

successive printing products (26) and, running along 
with the rear of these two printing products (26), to 

come to bear from above against its upper product part 
(32) in the border region (44) and to hold the latter 

firmly; a holding element (50) which is moved along a 
closed circulating path (50') and, running along with 

the respective printing product (26), is intended to 
come to bear from below against the lower product part 

(30), bearing against the supporting element (38) in  
 

the border region (44), and to hold the latter firmly, 
having opening sections of the path of movement (97) 

and circulating path (50'), downstream of the 
supporting element (38), in which sections the 

circulating opening element (72) and holding element 
(50) move away from each other for lifting the product 

parts (30, 32) off each other; and a holding-open 
element (102), co-running approximately in conveying 

direction (F), the opening element (50) and the holding 
element (72) releasing the product parts (30, 32) when 

the holding-open element (102) has entered between the 
latter in order to hold open the opened printing 

product (26) during further transport. 
Apparatus according to Claim 1, characterized 
in that the path of movement (97) of the opening 

element (72) has a return section (108) which is offset 
laterally, seen in conveying direction (F), with 

respect to the opening sections and is followed by an 
entry section (108') in which the opening element (72) 

engages, seen in conveying direction (F), from the side 
between the two successive printing products (26); and 

the transporting clips (16) are intended for the 
purpose of holding the printing products (26) in such a 

way that their side border (110), facing the opening 
unit (36), runs through, in a direction at right angles 

to the conveying direction (F), between the opening 
sections and the return section (108). 
Apparatus according to Claim 1 or 2, 
characterized in that the holding element (50) and the 

opening element (72) have suction heads which, for 
firmly holding the product parts (30, 32), are 

connected to a vacuum source. 
Apparatus according to one of Claims 1 to 3, 
characterized in that the holding element (50) is 

arranged on a roller (46) rotating about an axis (48) 
running at least approximately at right angles to the 

conveying direction (F) and parallel to the conveying 
plane (38').  

 
Apparatus according to Claim 4, characterized 
in that a plurality of holding elements (50) are 

arranged on the roller (46) one after the other in the 
circumferential direction, and the roller (46) is 

driven in such a way that in the cycle a holding 
element (50) in each case comes to bear against a 

printing product (26). 
Apparatus according to one of Claims 1 to 5, 
characterized by a carrying element (62) which is 

rotatingly driven about an axis of rotation (64) 
running approximately at right angles to the conveying 

direction (F) and parallel to the conveying plane (38') 
and on which there is arranged an arm (70) which bears 

the opening element (72) and, in dependence on the 
rotational position of the carrying element (62), can 

be brought out of a position of rest (78) into a 
working position (78') and back. 
Apparatus according to Claim 6, characterized 
in that the carrying element (62) is of a wheel-like 

design and on it there are mounted, one behind the 
other in the circumferential direction, on swivel pins

case an opening element (72) and, in dependence on the 
rotational position of the carrying element (62), can
