<ABSTRACT>
In a chair comprising a seat portion (3) which is 
suspended through two swingable links (4, 5) to be 

swingable with respect to a base portion (2) comprising a 
leg portion (6, 7) and a seat holder (12), the distance 

between lower ends of the two links (4, 5) is rendered 
changeable so that the parallelism between the two links 

(4, 5) can be changed thereby varying a swinging mode of 
the seat portion (3). Thus, lower ends of the two links 

(4, 5) are brought into engagement with two sliders (21, 
22) which are guided to be operable in directions for 

approaching to/separating from each other respectively.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a chair, and more
particularly, it relates to a chair comprising a swingable
seat portion.Japanese Utility Model Publication No.
2-35251 (1990) describes a chair, which is suitable for
seating an infant, provided with a seat portion which is
swingable with respect to a base portion having a leg
portion. Briefly stated, the seat portion of this chair
is suspended with respect to the base through two
swingable links. The two links are arranged in parallel
with each other, whereby the seat portion swings while
keeping its horizontal state.On the other hand, Japanese Utility Model Publication
No. 5-6847 (1993) also described a chair for an infant
comprising a seat portion which is suspended with respect
to a base portion through two swingable links in a
swingable manner. In this chair, the two links are not
parallel to each other but the distance between lower ends
thereof are made longer than that between upper ends.
Upon swinging, therefore, the seat portion rocks the 
infant for alternately vertically moving its head and feet
without keeping its horizontal state.When the seat portions swing in the aforementioned
manners, the two types of typical movements have
advantages of their own. The swinging movement of the
former seat portion keeping its horizontal state is
suitable for putting an infant to sleep immediately after
suckling it, for example, since this movement is rather
unstimulative. On the other hand, the swinging movement
of the latter seat portion rocking the infant is similar
to and hence substitutable for the movement of a mother
rocking her baby to sleep in her arms.Thus, it is preferable to vary the mode of a swinging
movement for an infant with the situation.Accordingly, an object of the present invention is to
provide a chair which can vary its swinging mode at need. US-A-165.0178 cited in the search report for this
application discloses a swinging davenport chair
comprising a base portion having a leg portion; a seat
portion; and four chain links suspending the seat
portion from the base portion for rendering the seat
portion swingable with respect to the base portion in
a swinging direction, the four chain links comprising
two chain links spaced apart in the swinging direction
of seat portion on respective opposite sides of the
seat portion, with the spacing apart of the upper and
lower ends of the chain links on each side of the seat
portion being separately changeable whereby the degree
of parallelism between the chain links on each side of
the seat

<CLAIMS>
A chair, comprising:

a base portion (2) having a leg portion (6, 7);
a seat portion (3); and
two swingable links (4, 5) for suspending said
seat portion (3) from said base portion (2) for

rendering said seat portion (3) swingable with respect
to said base portion (2) in a swinging direction, each

link (4, 5) being substantially U-shaped with a base
which is positioned under said seat portion (3) and

two arms which extend upwardly from said base on
respective opposite sides of said seat portion, said

bases of said substantially U-shaped links (4, 5)
being spaced apart in the swinging direction of said

seat portion (3);
and said chair being provided with means for
changing the spacing apart of said bases for changing

the degree of parallelism between the arms of said
links (4, 5) symmetrically on each of said opposite sides

of said seat portion (3).
A chair according to claim 1 wherein the base of
each substantially U-shaped link (4, 5) is attached to

a respective slider (21, 22) which is movable in the
swinging direction. 
A chair according to claim 2, wherein said
sliders (21, 22) are provided with respective grooves

(23, 24) for receiving said links (4, 5).
A chair according to any one of claims 1 to 3,
wherein said base portion (2) includes a wheel (9, 10)

rollable on a floor face (11).
A chair according to any one of claims 1 to 4,
wherein said leg portion includes a front leg (6) and

a rear leg (7) crossing each other and coupled
rotatably with each other at a crossing point thereof,

said seat portion (3) having a variable height by
altering the angle between said front leg (6) and said

rear leg (7).
A chair according to claim 1, wherein said means
for changing the spacing apart of said bases of said

links (4, 5) includes

two sliders (21, 22) operably guided towards and
away from each other, each slider being engaged with

a respective base and
an interlocking mechanism (29, 30, 44, 45, 46)
for symmetrically driving said two sliders (21, 22)

with each other.
A chair according to claim 6, wherein said
interlocking mechanism (29, 30, 44, 45, 46) includes

cross bars (29, 30) rotatably supported with respect
to said seat portion (3) and arranged in an X shape,

said cross bars (29, 30) each having one end being

operably coupled to one said slider (21) and the other
end being operably coupled to the other said slider

(22) respectively.
A chair according to claim 7, wherein each
operable coupling between said crossbars (29, 30) and

slot (33, 34, 37, 38) in one of said sliders.
A chair according to claim 7 or 8, wherein one of
said sliders (22) is provided with an operating part
