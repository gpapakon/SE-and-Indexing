<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to dissolved air flotation, particularly such flotation as used
as a primary treatment process in water treatment plants.In such a process, water saturated with dissolved air is generally released into
a stream of pre-flocculated raw water. On release, the air comes out of solution,
nucleating into a stream of bubbles of a few microns in diameter. The bubbles
attach to the floc, enhance its buoyancy, and cause it to float to the surface,
whence it may be removed. The dissolved air is usually released into the raw
water stream such that the main throughput carries the air into a residence tank.
The floc then floats to the surface and is removed by a suitable system such as
hydraulically or mechanically, using a scraper system. This system is however
expensive in terms of capital expenditure and operating expenditure, as well as
on space (land), in that a relatively large installation is required which in turn
requires high power and mechanical costs. Examples of prior art treatment
systems according to the preambles of Claims 1 and 11 can be found in GB-A-2230710;
GB-A-1496191; GB-A-1531775; JP-A-58-124586; and GB-A-1194850.GB-A-1 194 850 in particular describes a method and apparatus for removing
particulate materials from a liquid, using a zone of bubbles. The liquid
treatment vessel may be associated with a filter. GB-A-1 194 850 discloses
various kinds of bubble distributors, including grid and electrodes. Liquid is
passed into the treatment vessel via a pipe situated above the bubble generator.
This document does not disclose the introduction of the liquid via a riser having
a trumpet or bell end so that the energy of the liquid is dissipated in the manner
of the present invention.It is accordingly an object of the invention to seek to mitigate these 
disadvantages.Using the invention, the released impurities can then be removed by some
suitable means.According to a first aspect of the invention there is provided a method of
removing particulate impurities, comprising providing a treatment vessel,
providing a liquid containing particulate impurities, providing a source of gas,
providing a zone of gas bubbles in the liquid, passing substantially all incoming
liquid through the bubble zone whereby bubbles adhere to particulate 
impurities in the liquid and cause flotation thereof, and providing a filter for the
liquid, characterised by passing the liquid into the vessel above the zone of
bubbles in an initial direction away from the filter via a riser having a trumpet
or bell end

<CLAIMS>
A method of removing particulate impurities from a liquid, comprising
providing a treatment vessel, providing a liquid containing particulate impurities,

providing a source of gas, providing a zone of gas bubbles in the liquid, passing
substantially all incoming liquid through the bubble zone whereby bubbles adhere

to particulate impurities in the liquid and cause flotation thereof, and providing
a filter for the liquid, 
characterised by
 passing the liquid into the vessel above
the zone of bubbles in an initial direction away from the filter via a riser having

a trumpet or bell end so that the energy of the liquid is dissipated whereby
integrity of the zone is maintained, by passing the liquid through the zone of

bubbles in counter-current relation, and then passing the liquid to the filter in the
vessel, downstream of the zone of bubbles, for filtration of the liquid.
A method as defined in Claim 1, 
characterised in that
 the source of
bubbles comprises the liquid supersaturated with the gas.
A method as defined in Claim 1 or Claim 2, 
characterised by
 a step of
providing that the floating particles flocculate during rising to the liquid surface.
A method according to any preceding claim, 
characterised in that
 the
particulate impurities combine with each other and with sinking particulate

material.
A method according to any preceding claim, 
characterised in that
 the gas
bubble zone extends substantially over the cross-sectional area of the vessel.
A method as defined in Claim 5, 
characterised in that
 the gas bubble zone
is continuously maintained.
A method according to any preceding claim, 
characterised in that
 there is a 
step of regeneration of the filter means.
A method as defined in Claim 7, 
characterised in that
 the regeneration step
is a backwashing step.
A method according to any preceding claim, 
characterised in that
 there is a
step of de-scumming the liquid.
A method as defined in Claim 9, 
characterised in that
 there is a step of
raising the level of the liquid in the vessel to effect de-scumming.
Apparatus (1) for removing particulate materials from a liquid, comprising
a treatment vessel (12), an inlet (13) to the vessel for liquid containing impurities

to be treated, a filter (33) and a source of bubbles of gas (3) adapted to provide in
use a zone of bubbles in the vessel through which zone incoming liquid passes in

counter-current relation, 
characterised by
 the liquid inlet (13) comprising a riser
having a trumpet or bell end being disposed to pass the liquid into the vessel (12)

in an initial direction away from the filter and above the bubble zone so as not to
disrupt the bubble zone, and by the filter being in the vessel (12), downstream in

use of the zone of gas bubbles, the arrangement being such that liquid containing
impurities passes through the zone of gas bubbles in said counter-current relation

and then to the filter means.
Apparatus as defined in Claim 11, 
characterised in that
