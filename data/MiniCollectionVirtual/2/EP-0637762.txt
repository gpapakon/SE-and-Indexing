<ABSTRACT>
A polarized wave holding optical fiber 
(10) of the present invention includes a plurality 

of core portions (12a, 12b) in a high refractive 
index region that are juxtaposed in a radial 

direction of an optical fiber, and three core portions 
(12a, 12b) integrally propagate one fundamental 

mode. A method of producing a polarized 
wave holding optical fiber according to 

the present invention comprises forming a plurality 
of holes (22) in parallel with one another 

on a diameter of a glass rod (21) having a low 
refractive index as a clad, inserting glass rods 

(23) having a high refractive index as core portions 
into these holes (22), heating and integrating 

them together to form a base material, 
and melt-spinning the base material. A polarized 

wave holding optical fiber containing a rare 
earth element according to the present invention 

is formed by adding a rare earth element to a 
waveguide portion of the polarized wave holding 

optical fiber, and an optical amplifier and a laser oscillator utilize this polarized wave holding optical fiber. A 
polarized wave holding optical fiber coupler according to the present invention connects at least two polarized wave 

holding optical fibers, and heats, fuses and stretches them. The connection method comprises heating portions near 
the coupling point before and after connection.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a polarization-maintaining
optical fiber, which can be used in a variety of optical fiber
sensors or the like, to a method of production and to a connection
method therefor, and to a light amplifier, a laser oscillator and
a polarization-maintaining optical fiber coupler.Various polarization-maintaining optical fibers are
conventionally known. Figures 22 (a)âˆ¼(d) show representative
examples of conventional polarization-maintaining optical fibers.
The polarization-maintaining optical fiber in Figure 22(a) is
referred to as an elliptical core type. This elliptical core type
polarization-maintaining optical fiber lifts the degeneracy of two
orthogonal polarization modes by breaking the circular symmetry of
an ideal fiber with a circular core, and is designed so that the
propagation constant between the modes may differ, and so that
polarization may be maintained.Figures 22(b), 22(c) and 22(d) show polarization maintaining
optical fibers of types referred to, respectively, as an
elliptical cladding, a bow-tie, and a PANDA type. These 
polarization-maintaining optical fibers are designed to lift the
degeneracy of two polarization modes by introducing stress, which
is not circular symmetrical with respect to the center of the
optical fiber, into the fiber. In the figures, the numeral 1
indicates a core, 2 indicates a cladding, 3 indicates a jacket and
4 indicates stress-applying parts.The production technology for these polarization-maintaining
optical fibers is disclosed in a number of publications, one
example being J. Noda et al. "Polarization-Maintaining Fibers and
Their Applications", Journal of Lightwave Technology, vol. LT-4,
No. 8, August 1986, pp. 1071-1089.As is clear from the disclosure in this publication, the
production method for a conventional polarization-maintaining
optical fiber is not easy, so that the fiber is an extremely
special fiber and has not been widely used.For example, for the PANDA type polarization-maintaining
optical fiber, which is now most often used, a glass preform in
the form of a rod with a core/cladding structure for a single mode
optical fiber is first produced using the VAD method or the like.
In another process, the glass rod which forms the stress-applying
part is formed using the VAD method or the like. In order to make
the coefficient of thermal expansion of this glass rod large, it
is doped with boron oxide (B2O3) in an amount close to 20% by
weight. However, breakage occurs extremely easily in the quartz
glass which has been doped
