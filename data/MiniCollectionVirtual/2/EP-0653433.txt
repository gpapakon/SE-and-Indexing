<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a novel transition
metal compound, an olefin polymerization catalyst component
comprising the transition metal compound, an olefin
polymerization catalyst containing the olefin
polymerization catalyst component and a process for olefin
polymerization using the olefin polymerization catalyst.The "Kaminsky catalyst" is well known as a homogeneous
catalyst system for olefin polymerization. This catalyst
has an extremely high polymerization activity, and provides
a polymer having a narrow molecular weight distribution.Of the transition metal compounds used for the
Kaminsky catalyst, for example,
ethylenebis(indenyl)zirconium dichloride and
ethylenebis(4,5,6,7-tetrahydroindenyl)zirconium dichloride
has been known to be used for producing isotactic
polyolefins, as described in Japanese Patent Laid-Open
Publication No. 130314/1986. However, polyolefins prepared 
by the use of such catalyst generally have a low
stereoregularity and a low molecular weight. If low
temperatures are used, polymers having a high
stereoregularity or a high molecular weight can be
obtained, but a problem of low polymerization activity is
involved.It has been known that use of hafnium compounds in
place of the zirconium compounds makes it possible to
prepare high molecular polymers, as described in Journal of
Molecular Catalysis, 56 (1989), pp. 237-247, but this
process involves a problem of low polymerization activity.
Further, compounds such as dimethylsilylbis-substituted
cyclopentadienylzirconium dichloride have also been known
from Japanese Patent Laid-Open Publication No. 130704/1989
and Polymer Preprints, Japan, vol. 39, No. 6, pp. 1,614-1616
(1990), but there is a problem in that they do not
satisfy all of the high polymerization activity, and the
high melting point and molecular weight at the same time.Japanese Patent Laid-Open Publication No. 268307/1992
describes an olefin polymerization catalyst formed from a
metallocene compound represented by the following formula

and an aluminoxane. Further, EP 0 530 648 A1 describes another olefin
polymerization catalyst formed from a metallocene compound
represented by the following formula

wherein A is a lower alkyl group, and an aluminoxane.However, the polyolefins obtained by the use of these
catalysts are still insufficient in the melting point, the
molecular weight, etc. In this connection, a catalyst
containing a compound of the above formula wherein A is a
phenyl group is disclosed by Hoechst AG. in 40 YEARS
