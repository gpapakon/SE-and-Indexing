<ABSTRACT>
The invention is a new panoramic camera apparatus that instantaneously captures a 360 degree panoramic image. In one of the embodiments, the camera device comprises a convex mirror (210) for capturing light of the surrounding panorama, an astigmatic lens for correcting astigmatism, a camera objective lens (230) for converging light to a single point, a field flattening lens (240) for converting polar format images into two-dimensional planar images, and an image capture mechanism (250) for capturing optimized two-dimensional annular image of the surrounding panorama. The panoramic camera apparatus further includes various different systems for displaying and distributing the panoramic images. Specifically, these systems include means and method steps for digitally performing geometric transformation of the two-dimensional annular image into rectangular projections such that the panoramic image can be displayed using conventional methods such as printed images and televised images.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to the field of film and video photography. In
particular the present invention discloses a camera device that captures a 360
degree panoramic image and display systems for displaying the panoramic image
captured by the camera device.Most cameras only provide a small viewing angle. Thus, a typical
conventional camera only captures an image in the direction that the camera is
aimed. Limited view cameras force viewers to look only at what the camera
operator chooses to focus on. Some cameras use a specialised wide angle lens
to capture a wider panoramic image, but such panoramic cameras still have a
limited field of view.It would be desirable to have a camera system that would capture the light
from all directions such that a full 360 degree panoramic image can be created. A
full 360 degree panoramic image would allow the viewer to choose what she
would like to look at. Furthermore, a full 360 degree panoramic image allows
multiple viewers to simultaneously view the world from the same point, with each
being able to independently choose their viewing direction and field of view.At the present time, there are some known methods of creating 360 degree
panoramic images One example of a prior art arrangement comprises the bird-eye
auxiliary lens, details of which can be found at
www.tbk.de/panorama/show3.htm, which describes a 210° reflective mirror
auxiliary lens for use as an attachment to an SLR camera to provide a 360° image.A similar system is known from US 3 846 809 A.However, most current methods are subject to limitations 
due to their physical movements and mechanical complexity. For example, some of
the current methods operate by combining a series of individual photographs taken
in different directions into a single panoramic image. Some panoramic cameras spin
a lens and film to capture a panoramic view in a single sweeping motion.There is a market for panoramic photos to be used in multimedia
applications, typically provided on CD-ROMs. In the last few years, some software
manufacturers have introduced standards for digital storage and computer playback
of panoramic datasets. One example is QuickTime® VR, introduced by Apple@
Computer, Inc. Apple@ Computer's QuickTime® VR standard governs the file
storage format and the playback software needed to view their datasets.Currently, Apple Computer recommends and provides software tools
to implement a labor-intensive process for capturing these panoramic datasets. In
the Apple QuickTime® VR (QTVR) process a standard 35mm
