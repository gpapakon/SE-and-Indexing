<ABSTRACT>
A lightproof package of photosensitive strip material which is wound around a winding core and forms a hollow-cylindrical film coil whose outer circumferential surface is closed off in a lightproof manner by a covering film, its inner circumferential surface by the winding core and its end faces by thin-walled end caps in such a way that the outside dimensions of the coiled roll thus produced change only insignificantly due to the package and no unintentional exposure of the photographic material occurs even if the coiled roll becomes partially uncoiled and is introduced into a processing device in daylight when the material is used.

A process for enclosing in a lightproof manner a film roll of a strip of

cylinder having an outer circumferential surface and end faces surrounded by 
lightproof material comprising a cover sheet and two end caps, the film roll 

having a width and inner diameter that is essentially unchanged by the 
lightproof material, characterized by the following steps: 


joining a first end of the opaque cover sheet, which is wider than the 
film strip and slightly overhangs the film roll, to the end of an outermost 

spiral of the photosensitive material; 
winding the cover sheet around the photosensitive material and attaching 
the second end of the cover sheet to an outer circumferential surface of the 

cover sheet; 
mounting the two end caps having hub-shaped areas inserted from both 
sides into the core and held there by friction, and so that flexible sections with 

peripheral areas having flap-shaped segments overhang the film roll; 
curving the flap shaped segments downward, whereby, during the 
curving action, a pressure acts incrementally on the flap shaped segments 

towards a periphery of the outer circumferential surface of the cover sheet 
and in the direction toward the film roll, as a result of which the end face 

comes firmly together with the sealing disk, and an outer edge of the sealing 
disk forms a lightproof labyrinth with an edge of the cover sheet overhanging 

the film roll, so that the end cups, the cover sheet, and the core enclose the 
photosensitive material in a lightproof manner.
