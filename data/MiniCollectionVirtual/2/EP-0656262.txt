<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a tape cassette provided 
with an image source tape such as ink ribbon and an 
image receiving tape and also to a tape printer for 
use with such a tape cassette, the tape printer having 
a printing head and a platen disposed in a face-to-face 
relation to each other such that the two tapes in 
the tape cassette are driven through a printing area 
between the printing head and platen for printing 
an image from the printing head onto the image 
receiving tape via the image source tape by, for 
instance, a thermal printing process or a thermal 
transfer process, the image receiving tape after the 
printing being used as label or the like. In the prior art tape printer, however, the 
printing is done on the non-adhesive surface of the 
single-side adhesive tape when obtaining a tape for 
general display or as a label. Therefore, after the 
tape is applied at an intended position or to an 
intended object by separating the separable sheet, 
the printed image is liable to become blurred by being 
touched by an object. To prevent this, it is necessary 
to cover the printing surface by applying a transparent 
sheet or the like thereto, which is cumbersome.  
 
Further, peel-off of the print is liable to result 
due to direct contact of the printing surface with 
a feed roller when the tape is fed out of the tape 
printer after printing. Further, the tape printer of the type described 
is mostly used to produce tapes for general display 
or serving as labels. In other words, there has been no tape printer 
to produce a tape, which is used to obtain a lettering 
image by pushing a print on its image receiving tape 
on a separate sheet. The present invention has in the 
light of the above problems inherent in the prior 
art, as its object to provide a tape cassette, 
which is richly versatile and permits production of 
a tape for general display or serving as a label and 
with the printing surface protected to prevent direct 
contact while also permitting production of a tape 
(hereinafter referred to as a lettering tape) used 
to obtain an instant lettering image on a separate 
sheet by pushing the printing surface thereon, and 
also a tape printer, which is used with such a tape 
cassette, simple in construction and operation and 
inexpensive. To attain the above object of the invention,  
 
there is basically provided a tape cassette, which 
has a housing formed with first to third accommodation 
sections, the first and second accommodation sections 
respectively accommodating an

<CLAIMS>
A tape cassette detachably loaded in a tape printer. 
The tape cassette (35, 201) according to claim 1, 
characterized in that an image source tape (91, 215) and 

another tape (25, 217, 219) are accommodated in a housing (90, 
202) of the cassette, and that a separator (117, 239, 241, 

243) is provided on the housing such that the separator 
extends between said two tapes (91, 25; 215, 217, 219) to 

prevent direct contact thereof before a printing operation. 
The tape cassette (35, 201) according to claim 2, 
characterized in that the another tape is an image receiving 

tape (25, 217).
