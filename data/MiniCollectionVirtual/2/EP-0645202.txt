<ABSTRACT>
A die for a press brake is formed with: a first V-shaped 
groove (43A) extending in a longitudinal direction 

and on an upper surface thereof; a second V-shaped groove 
(43B) extending in the same way in parallel to the first V-shaped 

groove; a plurality of first engage slots (45A) 
arranged on a lower surface thereof in parallel to the 

first V-shaped groove by a predetermined distance away (A) 
from a central bottom line of the first V-shaped groove; 

and a plurality of second engage slots (45B) arranged in 
the same way in parallel to the second V-shaped groove by 

the same predetermined distance away from a central bottom 
line of the second V-shaped groove. The first and second 

engage slots (45A, 45B) are used in common for alignment of 
the first and second V-shaped grooves (43A, 43B) with a 

punch (7) mated to the die. Accordingly, after one of the 
V-shaped grooves has been aligned with the punch, even if 

the two V-shaped grooves are replaced with each other, the 
die can be used immediately without any additional 

alignment with the punch.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a die 
according to the precharacterizing portion of claim 1 
and to a die assembly comprising such a die. In 
particular, the present invention relates to a die formed with 
a number of V-shaped grooves and a die assembly having a die 
base for supporting the die in such a way that the V-shaped 
grooves can be replaced without any alignment with respect to a 
punch whenever the die is removed from the die base for die 
replacement, as far as the die has been once aligned with the 
punch. Fig. 1A shows a first example of a conventional 
bending tool (a pair of die and punch) for a press brake, 
in which an upper table 1 and a lower table 3 are arranged 
so as to be opposed to each other in the vertical 
direction. Further, any one of the upper and lower tables 
1 and 3 is moved vertically relative to the other. A punch 
(the upper bending tool) 7 is removably and replaceably 
attached to the upper table 1 by a fixing member 5. A die 
(the lower bending tool) 11 is also removably and 
exchangeably attached to the lower table 3 by a die holder 
9. Further, in Fig. 1A, when a plate material (work) W is 
set onto the die 11 and then the lower end of the punch 7 
is lowered so as to be engaged with a first V-shaped groove 
13A formed in the upper surface of the die 11, it is  
 
possible to bend the work W into a V-shape. In the above-mentioned bending tool, a second V-shaped 
groove 13B of the die 11 is often used when the plate 
thickness and/or material of the work W change, without 
changing the punch 7. In this case, the necessary 
procedure is as follows: the die 11 is first removed from 
the die holder 9 by unfastening a plurality of fixing bolts 
15 screwed into the bolt holes arranged in a lower surface 
of and in the longitudinal direction of the die 11; 
secondly, the front and rear direction (the right and left 
direction in Fig. 1A) of the removed die 11 is reversed; 
thirdly the second V-shaped groove 13B is aligned with 
respect to the punch 7; and lastly the fixing bolts 15 are 
all fastened again. Therefore, whenever the die 11 is removed and then 
reversed, since a number of fixing bolts 15 must be 
unfastened and then fastened, there exists a problem in 
that the die replacement work is troublesome takes a time. To overcome the above-mentioned problem, another die 
assembly as shown in Fig. 1B has been proposed, as 
disclosed in Japanese Published Unexamined Utility Model 
Application No. 54-2739. In this second example of the 
conventional die assembly, a
