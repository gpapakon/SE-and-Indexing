<DESCRIPTION>
 AIR- OR OXYGEN DIFFUSION ELECTRODEThis invention relates to a novel gas porous electrode, and in particular to an air or oxygen breathing cathode suitable for use in the generation of ozone.Ozone has a range of uses similar to that of chlorine, including the bleaching of clays and pulp and the treatment of drinking water, swimming pool water, municipal secondary effluents, high quality water (eg for electronic component manufacturing) and odours. Because chlorine produces chlorinated organics, which present long term toxicity hazards at low concentrations in water, there is a large potential market for a less toxic replacement for chlorine. 

Ozone has the potential to take over from chlorine. In addition, ozone may beused in organic synthesis for the oxidation of the carbon-carbon double bond,medical therapy and sterilisation. Examples of chemical syntheses using ozoneinclude the production of silver oxide, heliotropin, pelargonic acid, azelaic acid,peracetic acid, germicides, steroids, Nylon-9 precursor and the separation ofcerium from other rare earths.Ozone has a short half-life, and because of its highly reactivenature, tends to decompose in contact with most metals and oxides and is potentially explosive when concentrated either as a gas or liquid or when dissolved into solvents or absorbed into gels. Transportation therefore is not practical, and consequently it is desirable to generate ozone at the point of use. Currently, the major method of ozone generation adopted in industry and the utilities is corona discharge. In this process an alternating, very high voltage is discharged through a dry air or oxygen stream, producing a flow of gasescontaining up to approximately 2% ozone where an air stream is used, and upto approximately 4% ozone where oxygen is used. Corona discharge methods for ozone production have several disadvantages. In particular, the equipment required is capital intensive and bulky. In addition, the process requires thefeed gas to be cleaned, compressed, cooled and dried before passing to thedischarge tube. The use of oxygen rather than air where higher yields of ozoneare required, adds significantly to the cost. The low ozoneroxygen ratios meanthat dissolution of the ozone into water or other process medium is difficult,with low rates of transfer. An additional drawback is that appreciable amounts 

of nitrogen oxides are produced when an air feed is used, ultimately producingnitric acid if the output stream contacts water.Another method of ozone generation is the
