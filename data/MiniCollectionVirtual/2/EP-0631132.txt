<ABSTRACT>
An electrophoresis apparatus (30) for automatically performing 
medical assays includes an electrophoresis platform 

(48) which cooperates with a gantry assembly (56). The 
electrophoresis platform and the gantry assembly are movable 

along paths that are perpendicular to each other. An 
applicator assembly (50) includes pipettes (52) which 

transfer fluid samples from a specimen tray (158) to an 
electrophoresis plate (110) mounted on the electrophoresis 

platform. The electrophoresis platform then moves to a 
position into the gantry assembly, where electrophoresis is 

conducted to separate the samples into different fractions. 
The electrophoresis platform then moves beneath a reagent 

pouring station (54) where a reagent is applied to make the 
separated fractions fluoresce under ultraviolet light. The 

electrophoresis platform is then moved beneath the gantry 
assembly again, and an air knife (338) in the gantry assembly 

spreads the reagent. After incubation and drying of 
the electrophoresis plate, the electrophoresis platform and 

gantry assembly are moved relative to one another while the 
electrophoresis plate is read with the aid of ultraviolet 

lamps (296) and a photomultiplier tube (312) mounted in the 
gantry assembly. The gain of the photomultiplier tube is 

automatically adjusted and the data gathered is automatically 
edited to remove background noise. The edited 

results can be printed or displayed on a video monitor.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method and 
apparatus for automatically conducting eletrophoresis 
with an electrophoresis plate. The present invention is directed in general to 
the field of electrophoretic analysis of liquid 
samples, such as biological specimens. Valuable diagnostic information can be obtained by an 
analysis of certain biological fluids such as blood serum. 
Electrophoresis is known to be an effective technique for 
separating the various components of such fluid for subsequent 
analyses using optical densitometry techniques. The 
physical phenomenon for electrophoretic analysis is that 
particles which have an effective electric charge and which 
are deposited on a solid or semi-solid medium are caused to 
move with respect to the medium by an electric field 
applied across the medium. Particles of different types 
move at different rates, so a mixture of different types of 
particles is separated into its different components or 
fractions by electrophoretic analysis. These separated 
fractions may then be stained by exposure to a suitable 
reagent so that the fractions can be optically detected 
using visible or ultraviolet light. The invention seeks to provide an improved 
method and apparatus for automatically conducting electrophoresis. An aim of the present invention is to provide an electrophoresis 
method and apparatus in which an electrophoresis 
plate is movable in a first direction and an 
optical means for scanning the electrophoresis plate is 
movable in an orthoqonal second direction. Another aim of the present invention is to provide an electrophoresis 
apparatus having an air knife which distributes  
 
a liquid reagent across an electrophoresis plate, and which 
can be used to remove excess water from the plate to transfer 
hot air against the plate to help dry the plate. A 
related object is to provide air duct valves to isolate the 
electrophoresis platform from the ambient atmosphere except 
when air is beinq transferred throuqh the air knife Another aim of the present invention is to provide a method 
for automatically adjusting the anode voltage supplied to 
a photomultiplier tube in an automatic electrophoresis 
apparatus. Another aim of the present invention is to provide a method 
for automatically editing data collected by an automatic 
electrophoresis apparatus to reduce background noise. Another aim of the present invention is provide a method 
for chemically avoiding background noise due to albumin 
when isoenzymes of creatine kinase are assayed
