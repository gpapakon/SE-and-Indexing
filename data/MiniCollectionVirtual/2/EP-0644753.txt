<DESCRIPTION>
 BURN FOAM AND DELIVERY SYSTEMTechnical BackgroundThis invention relates generally to antibiotic ointments and relates particularly to antibiotic formulations adapted for topical application as a clinically water soluble foam and useful in treatment of burns and abrasions.Background ArtA burn is probably the most traumatic and severe injury that the human body can sustain and still survive. The major problem is that if the burn itself does not prove fatal, the infection that follows might. A severe thermal burn removes the upper protective layers of the dermis and epidermis as well as disrupting the immunological barriers to infection. It retards regrowth of normal skin and promotes collagen formation which leads to scarring.The therapeutic use of silver sulfadiazine in successfully treating thermal burns in man and animal is well documented. For example, U.S. Patent No. 3,761,590 to Fox describes a process for preparing a thick cream ointment containing silver sulfadiazine useful in burn treatment and this disclosure is incorporated herein by reference.It has been clinically shown that these silver sulfadiazine cream ointments are very effective in the treatment of burn and abrasive injuries to the skin by preventing bacterial infections, especially from Pseudomonas strains. However, in addition to the objectionable odor, cream silver sulfadiazine ointments are very poorly water soluble, making them extremely difficult and painful to remove from the burn area. This also results in excessive product waste and expense, in addition to the time-consuming task of application and removal of the ointment. There is thus a definite need in the art for an inexpensive, easy to apply silver sulfadiazine formulation that is painless to the patient when applied, and that is clinically water soluble permitting it to be 

washed off instantly with minimum discomfort to the patient.Disclosure of the InventionAccordingly, it is an object of the present invention to provide a silver sulfadiazine formulation that has all the advantageous features of presently used formulations while minimizing the disadvantages thereof.It is another object of the present invention to provide a novel antibiotic formulation adapted for topical application as a clinically water soluble foam.Another object of the present invention is to provide an improved antibiotic formulation that may be easily, quickly and relatively painlessly applied to abrasions or burns and is essentially water soluble to permit easy removal with a minimum of pain to

Claims :
1. A pH neutral antibiotic formulation adapted for topical application as a clinically water soluble foam having a micelle structure and having the physical and chemical properties of remaining in the foam state for at least twenty-four (24) hours after application, comprising: a quantity of approximately 1% by weight of an antibiotic having molecules of generally linear structure with one end thereof being more hydrophilic than the other, with the other end being more hydrophobic, suspended in an oil-in-water emulsion, said oil-in-water emulsion including between approximately 2.45 and 11.17% by weight of white petrolatum, between approximately 2.45 and 11.17% by weight of a fatty alcohol, between approximately .98 and 4.46% by weight of an emollient, between approximately 1.46 and 6.70% by weight of an emulsifying agent, between approximately 1.14 and 5.20% by weight of a humectant, a preservative and between 50% and up to 80.22% water by weight; and said emulsion being aerosolized by an inactive aliphatic hydrocarbon gaseous propellant of approximately 10% by weight into a stable micelle-like foam structure with membranes forming bubbles thereof including said antibiotic molecules of linear structure aligned with their more-hydrophilic ends generally facing away from a hollow chamber of the bubbles and the ore-hydrophobic ends generally pointing down into the hollow chamber, whereby a more water soluble portion of the antibiotic is directed toward outside of the bubble and a more water insoluble portion is directed toward inside the bubble.
2. The antibiotic formulation of Claim 1 wherein said oil-in-water emulsion includes an analgesic of between 0 and 20% by weight selected from the group of analgesics consisting of xylocaine and benzocaine. 


 3. The antibiotic formulation of Claim 1 wherein said antibiotic is selected from the group of antibiotics consisting of bacitracin, neomycin, silver sulfadiazine, and a mixture of polymyxin B sulfate, bacitracin, zinc, and neomycin sulfate.
4. The antibiotic formulation of Claim 1 wherein said antibiotic formulation is adapted for treatment of skin abrasions and burned tissue and wherein said antibiotic is silver sulfadiazine.
5. The antibiotic formulation of Claim 4 wherein the fatty alcohol is stearyl alcohol, the emollient is isopropyl myristate, the emulsifying agent is a quantity of sorbitan monooleate and a quantity of polyoxyl 40 stearate, the humectant is propylene glycol, and the preservative is methylparaben and the inactive aliphatic hydrocarbon gaseous propellant is a mixture of propane and isobutane.
6. The antibiotic formulation of Claim 4 wherein the inactive aliphatic hydrocarbon gaseous propellant is a mixture of 85% isobutane and 15% propane.
7. The antibiotic formulation of Claim 4 wherein said oil-in-water emulsion includes, by weight, approximately 8.22% white petrolatum, 8.22% stearyl alcohol, 3.28% isopropyl myristate, 0.55% sorbitan monooleate, 4.38% polyoxyl 40 stearate, 3.83% propylene glycol, 60.22% water, and 0.30% methylparaben and the inactive aliphatic hydrocarbon gaseous propellant includes, by weight, 5.00% propane and 5.00% isobutane. 


 8. The antibiotic formulation of Claim 4 wherein said oil-in-water emulsion includes, by weight, approximately 8.22% white petrolatum, 8.22% stearyl alcohol, 3.28% isopropyl myristate, 0.55% sorbitan monooleate, 4.38% polyoxyl 40 stearate, 3.83% propylene glycol, 60.22% water, and 0.30% methylparaben and the inactive aliphatic hydrocarbon gaseous propellant includes, by weight, 1.50% propane and 8.50% isobutane.
9. A method of making a pH neutral antibiotic formulation that is dispensable as a stable water soluble foam to permit painless application and removal thereof and capable of remaining in the foam state for a period of at l*-ast twenty-four (24) hours after dispensing, comprising the steps of: combining approximately 1% by weight of an antibiotic with between approximately 2.45 and 11.17% by weight of white petrolatum, between approximately 2.45 and 11.17% by weight of a stearyl alcohol, between approximately .98 and 4.46% by weight of isopropyl myristate, between approximately 0.16 and .75% by weight of sorbitan monooleate, between approximately 1.30 and 5.95% by weight of polyoxyl 40 stearate, between 1.14 and 5.20% by weight of propylene glycol, methylparaben and between 50% up to 80.22% water by weight; heating this mixture with stirring to approximately 75Â°C; maintaining this temperature and stirring until all ingredients are in the liquid state and an oil-in-water emulsion is obtained, and while hot enough to maintain the liquid state placing the liquid into aerosol cans and pressurizing the cans to approximately thirty-five pounds per square inch pressure using an inactive aliphatic hydrocarbon gaseous propellant.
