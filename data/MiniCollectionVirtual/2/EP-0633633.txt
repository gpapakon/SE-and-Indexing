<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a connector for a card (board), characterised in that it comprises:   - a socket (base) (20) of plane general shape, having electrical contact elements (15), a first end (19) of which extends beyond at least one edge of the socket (20) and a second end (25) of which extends beyond an upper face of the socket (20), as well as a first hinge element (5, 18); - a receiving cover (22) having insertion slideways (44) located below the lower plane (41) of the cover (22), as well as a second hinge element (6, 7, 8) complementary to the first hinge element (5, 18).   The socket (20) and the cover (22) have, respectively, first and second complementary locking elements (1, 2, 3, 9) arranged opposite the first and second hinge elements (5, 6, 7, 8, 18) in order to keep the socket (20) and the cover (22) in the closed connection position of the card.

Card connector comprising: 

a base (20) of a generally planar shape, having on the 
one hand electrical contact elements (15) with a first end 

(25) extending beyond an upper face of the base (20), and on 
the other hand a first hinge element (5, 18), 
a cover (22) for receiving the said card and having 
introduction channels (44) located below the lower plane (41) 

of the cover (22) as well as a second hinge element (6, 7, 8) 
complementary to the first hinge element (5, 18), the first 

(5, 18) and the second (6, 7, 8) forming a hinge about an 
axis of rotation, 
 
   the base (20) and the cover (22) having respectively 

complementary first and second locking elements (1, 2, 3, 9) 
disposed opposite the first and second hinge elements (5, 6, 

7, 8, 18) to hold the base (20) and the cover (22) in the 
closed position for connection of the card,
 
   the connector being characterised in that a second end 

(19) of the said electrical contact elements (15) extends 
beyond at least one edge of the base (20), and in that the 

said first and second locking elements (1, 2, 3, 9) can be 
disconnected by a pushing force substantially parallel to the 

said axis of rotation. 
Connector according to claim 1, characterised in that it 
comprises a spring (30) for opening the cover, having a first 

arm (31) housed in the hinge (5, 18) and a second arm (33) 
housed in a groove (35, 50) in the base (20) or in the cover 

(22). 
Connector according to claim 2, characterised in that the 
said groove (50) adjoins one of the said introduction 

channels (44).  
 
Connector according to one of the preceding claims, 
characterised in that the said channels (44) are substantially 

perpendicular to the said axis of rotation. 
Connector according to claim 1, characterised in that the 
cover (22) can be deformed so as to permit the said 

disconnection. 
Connector according to one of the preceding claims, 
characterised in that the second locking elements (3, 9) are 

integrated into the introduction channels (44). 
Connector according to claim 6, characterised in that the 
base (20) has a stop (13) for the card located in the 

vicinity of a first locking element (1, 2) and between this 
element and the first hinge element (5, 18). 
Connector according to claim 7, characterised in that the 
stop (13) is a slope inclined with respect to a direction (F) 

in which the card (70) is introduced. 
Connector according to one of the preceding claims, 
characterised in that the first and second locking elements 

are interlocking projections. 
Connector according to claim 9, characterised in that 
the first and/or second locking elements have a chamfered 

introduction region (43).
