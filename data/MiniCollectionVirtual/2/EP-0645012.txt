<ABSTRACT>
An apparatus and method for optically measuring the functional capacity of blood platelets and the blood clotting system. The invention includes a mechanical specimen handling apparatus (1) with one or more optical end-point detectors (6). The apparatus incubates a small quantity of diluted whole blood (2) with added solid or liquid reagents at body temperature, and mixes the blood via rocking and rotational motions so as to expose the blood uniformly to the reagents. The optical end-point detectors then measure the activity of platelets within the blood specimen, clotting time, and the clotting cascade. Several intermediate measurements are also available.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to optical blood hemostatic
analysis apparatus and methods, and more particularly
to an apparatus and method for optically measuring the
functional capacity of blood platelets and the blood
clotting system.In the medical field, it is often desirable to
measure and evaluate blood clotting times and blood
platelet function, and more particularly, to determine
the state of the platelets in circulation. For
example, studies of platelet function and coagulation
time are useful in the identification of patients who
are at increased risk of thrombosis due to platelet
hyperactivity or to blood hypercoagulability. They are
also of use in the identification of patients who are
at risk of bleeding due to platelet hypoactivity or to
blood hypocoagulability. Devices for measuring these
aspects of blood are therefore quite useful. The
ability to determine the state of the platelets in
circulation is important because it enables a
relatively accurate assessment of the likelihood of
forming a coronary thrombosis leading to myocardial
infarction. Separate blood clotting evaluation instruments and
platelet function evaluation instruments have been
known in the art. However, testing instruments for
determining the state of the platelets in circulation
are not available. A number of machines on the market
for evaluation of blood clotting utilize a light beam
for detecting the clotting end-point, but can cnly be
used with plasma (a relatively clear fluid derived by
removing the red cells). Very few blood clotting
evaluation instruments can be used with both opaque
whole blood and with plasma, but these are all believed
to require physical contact with the specimen, and thus
contain parts that are an infection hazard and must be
carefully cleaned to avoid infectious propagation. In
addition, such devices are difficult to clean
reproducibly, potentially affecting test performance.
This latter class of machine often uses a primarily
mechanical end-point detector, and, for that reason, is
prone to breakdown. One example of such an instrument
is known as a fibrometer, which uses a metal probe.Devices exist which are capable of evaluating
platelet function, although the state of the platelets
in circulation is not determined. It is believed that
all of these machines operate with plasma and are
single-purpose instruments. These machines are
generally called platelet aggregometers. Aggregometers
generally transmit a light through a suspension of
platelet-rich plasma (plasma containing platelets)
incubated at

<CLAIMS>
A method for preparing a detection reagent composition for use in
optically measuring characteristics of a specimen fluid

containing platelets, comprising the steps of mixing a
detection reagent comprised of molecules having a high

axial ratio and a small size capable of specifically
binding to platelets with:


(a) a diluent; and,
(b) a platelet agonist.
The method of claim 1, wherein the diluent is a saline
solution. 
The method of claim 1 wherein the platelet agonist is
a catecholamine. 
The method of claim 1, wherein whole blood is anticoagulated
and added to the detection reagent before

mixing. 
The method of claim 1, including the further step of

adding solution containing a soluble calcium salt to
the mixture.
The method of claim 4, wherein the diluent is first
mixed with the detection reagent, before the whole

blood is added to the mixture.
The method of claim 1, wherein the detection reagent
is diatomaceous earth.
The method of claim 7, wherein the diatomaceous earth
is coated with humic acid.
The method of claim 3, wherein the catecholamine is
epinephrine or noradrenaline.
The method of claim 4, wherein the whole blood is mixed
with the diatomaceous earth of claim 8.
The method of claim 3, wherein the platelet agonist
further comprises humic acid.
