<ABSTRACT>
A glass preform for an optical fiber containing a dopant in a core 
portion at a high concentration is produced by providing a glass tube, 

forming a coating film of a sol-gel solution containing a dopant compound 
on an inner wall of the glass tube, and vitrifying and collapsing the glass 

tube having the coating of the sol-gel solution while flowing a mixture of 

chlorine and oxygen through the glass tube to obtain a glass preform.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method for 
producing a glass preform for use in the fabrication of an 
optical fiber, in particular, an optical fiber which is used 
as an optical fiber laser or an light amplifying fiber. An optical fiber comprising a core to which a rare 
earth element such as Er or Nd is added is mainly used as a 
light amplifying fiber. As a method for adding a rare earth element to a 
quartz optical fiber, there are known a vapor phase addition 
method and a solution-impregnation method. In one example of the gas phase addition method, 
when a core part is formed on an inner wall of a quartz pipe 
by the MCVD method, a compound of a rare earth element is 
heated around 1000°C and a vapor of the compound is supplied 
in the quartz pipe together with a vapor of a glass-forming 
material such as SiCl4 and GeCl4, then the pipe is heated to 
a high temperature to vitrify the compound and also collapse 
the pipe to obtain a preform, which is drawn to fabricate an 
optical fiber.  
 One example of the solution-impregnation method 
utilizes a soot preform for a core part which is produced by 
the VAD method. In this method, the soot preform for the 
core part is dipped in a solution of a compound of a rare 
earth element dissolved in an alcohol. After removing the 
soot preform from the solution, the alcohol is evaporated 
off from the soot preform at room temperature to deposit the 
compound of the rare earth element on the glass soot. Then, 
the glass soot carrying the compound of the rare earth element 
is sintered and vitrified to produced a transparent 
preform. In order to use the quartz optical fiber containing 
the rare earth element as the optical fiber laser or 
the optical amplifying fiber, a higher concentration of a 
dopant compound of a rare earth element is preferred. 
However, in the conventional methods, since the vitrification 
of the glass soot requires a high temperature of 1500°C 
or higher, the rare earth element tends to be associated and 
crystallized in the glass so that the rare earth element 
cannot be uniformly added to the glass.  
 EP-A-0 443 781, published on 28 September 1991, and 
EP-A-0 469 795, published on 5 February 1992 and falling within the 
terms of Article 54(3)EPC, both disclose 
methods for producing glass preforms for use in the 
fabrication of optical fibers. 
On an inner surface of a glass tube, comprising MCVD cladding and 
optionally MCVD doped core material, is formed a coating film derived 
from a sol-gel solution. This solution
