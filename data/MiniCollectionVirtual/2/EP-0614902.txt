<ABSTRACT>
Novel phosphine compounds are represented by formula (I): 

wherein R¹ and R², which may be the same or different, each 
represent a phenyl group or a phenyl group substituted with 

a halogen atom or a lower alkyl group or they are taken 
together to form a divalent hydrocarbon group; and R³ and R⁴, 

which may be the same or different, each represent a lower 
alkyl group, a phenyl group or a phenyl group substituted 

with a halogen atom, a lower alkyl group or a lower alkoxy 
group or they are taken together to form a divalent 

hydrocarbon group. 
Transition metal-phosphine complexes containing the 
phosphine compound (I) as a ligand catalyse asymmetric 

synthesis to provide a compound having a desired absolute 
configuration in high yield and high asymmetric yield.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to novel phosphine compounds, 
and to transition metal complexes containing them as 
ligands and which are useful as catalysts for various asymmetrical 
synthesis reactions. A number of transition metal complexes have hitherto 
been used as catalysts for organic synthesis. In particular, 
since noble metal complexes, though expensive, are stable and 
easy to handle, intensive study has been conducted on their 
use as a catalyst for organic synthesis. As a result, many 
noble metal complex catalysts have been reported to realize 
organic synthesis reactions that have been regarded as 
impossible with a conventional means. Interalia, many catalysts exhibiting excellent 
performance in asymmetric reactions are found among those 
composed of an optically active tertiary phosphine 
coordinated to a transition metal, e.g., rhodium, palladium, 
ruthenium or nickel. In an attempt to further improve the 
performance of these catalysts, plenty of phosphine compounds 
having a specific structure have been developed (see Nippon 
Kagakukai (ed.), KAGAKU SOSETSU, Vol. 32, pp. 237-238 (YUKI 
KINZOKU NO KAGAKU) (1982)).  U.S. Patent 5,206,399 discloses 2,2'-bis(diphenylphosphino)-5,5',6,6',7,7',8,8'-octahydro-1,1'-binaphthyl 
and asymmetric hydrogenation using a transition 
metal complex containing the phosphine as a ligand. A great number of special phosphine compounds have 
thus been developed for the purpose of providing a catalyst 
having higher performance in asymmetric syntheses. However, 
they are not always satisfactory in selectivity, conversion, 
catalytic activity, asymmetric yield, and the like depending 
on the substrate or the reaction to which they are applied. An object of the present invention is to provide a 
novel phosphine compound providing a complex having higher 
catalytic performance than the conventional catalysts. As a result of extensive investigations, the present 
inventors have found that a transition metal complex 
containing a novel phosphine compound having a 
5,5',6,6',7,7',8,8'-octahydro-1,1'-binaphthyl skeleton (i.e., 
bitetrahydronaphthalene group) and a phosphine structure and 
a phosphite structure per molecule is considerably superior 
to the known optically active phosphine-transition metal 
complexes in asymmetric yield and selectivity in asymmetric 
syntheses. The present invention has been completed based on 
this finding. The present invention relates to a phosphine compound 
represented by formula (I):  
 
 
wherein R1 and R2, which may be the same or
