<ABSTRACT>
Known transcoders for compressed video signals comprise a decoder 
and a coder coupled thereto, between which a data signal is transmitted. 

Because compressed video signals comprise so-called difference pictures and 
normal pictures, both the decoder and the coder should have a feedback loop 

which is utilized in decoding and coding a difference picture and is not 
utilized in decoding and coding a normal picture. For example, for the 

purpose of prediction means (motion compensation and motion estimation) 
present in the feedback loop of the coder, much computation has to be carried 

out in the coder. The computation required is considerably reduced by concomitantly 
transmitting one or more information signals in addition to the 

data signal in a transcoder according to the invention, and complete decoding 
and complete coding no longer takes place.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a transcoding device comprising the features
of the preamble of claim 1.Such a transcoding device is known from EP 0 508 597 A2. The data
reprocessing means are formed by a part of the ADPCM codec 23(1) or a part
of the ADPCM codec 23(2), as shown in figure 1 of this patent application.
The demultiplexing means are formed by the Format Transform 21, also
shown in figure 1. The data processing means are formed by the other part of
the ADPCM codec 23(1) or the other part of the ADPCM codec 23(2) and the
multiplexing means are formed by the Format Transform 27.The object of the invention is, inter alia, to provide a transcoding
device of the type mentioned in the preamble, in which the computation 
required is considerably reduced.For this purpose, the transcoding device according to the invention
has the characteristic that the data reprocessing means comprise a control
input and that the data processing means comprise a control input, both
control inputs being coupled to the second output of the demultiplexing
means.Via the control inputs, the data reprocessing means and the data
processing means are provided with information signals.An embodiment of the transcoding device according to the invention
has the characteristic that the information signal comprises a quantization
control signal, and in the decoding section
the second output of the demultiplexing means comprising a quantization
control signal output,the control input of the data reprocessing means comprising a quantization
control signal input,
and in the coding section
the second input of the multiplexing means comprising a quantization
control signal input,the control input of the data processing means comprising a quantization
control signal input.In this embodiment, the information signal is formed by the
quantization control signal which is fed to the data reprocessing means via a
control input from the quantization control signal output of the
demultiplexing means. Furthermore, the quantization control signal is
optionally processed, for example fed via a control unit to a control input of
the data processing means and to the quantization control signal input of the
multiplexing means. Because the quantization control signal is fed to the 
coding section, it no longer needs to be derived from the data signal, for
which purpose much computation was necessary.A further embodiment of the transcoding device according to the invention
has the characteristic that in the decoding section
the data reprocessing means
