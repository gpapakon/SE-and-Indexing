<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to the composition of a novel medicament 
for preventive and therapeutical treatment of cattle against the threat 
of ecto- end endoparasites. With regard to the many different kinds of protozoic and bacterial 
parasites and often fast and wide spreading there exists a need for 
compounds which are not only for therapy of sick animals, but which 
can also be used for prevention of infections, while pollution of the 
environment by undesirable or dangerous chemicals should be obviated. The composition should be applicable orally as well as parenterally to 
fight endo- and ectoparasites of horses, cows, sheep, goats and pigs. The composition should be stable, easy to store and to transport. On the other hand such a product should not influence the environment, 
for example the soil used by the herds; this is a problem to be 
considered primarily, because cattle herds can disperse metabolites 
over large regions, which could lead to threatening of animals and humans. Hitherto known anthelmintics for example have been dispersed by cattle 
faeces over pasture and cultivation grounds; and thereby useful organisms 
in the soil have been destroyed. Infection with ectoparasites, such as insects and larvae, through the 
skin often causes appearance of endoparasites, and since the point of 
time for necessary therapy is often difficult to discern in many 
animals, a novel composition having a broad spectrum activity and lacking 
the said detrimental properties will satisfy a need in wide-scale 
veterinary practice. Blood-sucking round worms (nematodes) are a severe threat to live-stock, 
but with the known remedies against these worms the larvae of  
 
several arthropods, which appear simultaneously, could not be fought 
at the same time. Moreover the remainders and metabolic products of known anthelmintic 
and antiparasitic medicaments pollute the pastures and may cause allergic 
diseases to other animals and humans. In particular it was difficult to fight trematodes and larvae of 
arthropods side by side with nematodes, and in particular to provide 
a preventive treatment against several groups of said parasites. The composition prepared according to the present invention meets the 
said requirements, and it can be used for prophylaxis as well as for 
therapy of cows, sheep, goats and pigs, in infections by adult worm 
species and by larvae stages of worm species and of arthropoda. Many parasites have a growth cycle in several host animals, where 
their metabolic system demonstrates
