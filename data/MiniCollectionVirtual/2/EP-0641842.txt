<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to surface-modified pigments based on TiO2 pigments or plateletlike substrates coated with TiO2, which are coated with a layer comprising borates of the alkaline earth metals and/or double borates of the alkali and/or alkaline earth metals, and to their use for inhibiting yellowing of plastics and polymer systems.

<CLAIMS>
Surface-modified pigments, characterized in that
titanium dioxide pigments or titanium dioxide-coated

plateletlike substrates have been aftercoated with a
layer consisting of borates of the alkaline earth metals

or double borates of the alkali and/or alkaline earth
metals.
Process for preparing the surface-modified
pigments of Claim 1, characterized in that the aqueous

solution of titanium dioxide pigments or of titanium
dioxide-coated plateletlike substrates has added to it,

at one and the same time, a water-soluble alkali and/or
alkaline earth metal salt and a water-soluble boron-oxygen

compound under conditions which lead to deposition
of the borate or double borate and in that the aftercoated

pigment is separated off, washed and optionally
dried or calcined.
Surface-modified pigments according to Claim 1,
characterized in that the proportion of borate, based on

the total pigment, is 0.1-20 mass per cent.
Surface-modified pigments according to Claim 1,
characterized in that the plateletlike substrate is mica.
Surface-modified pigments according to Claim 1,
characterized in that the plateletlike substrates are

SiO
2
 flakes.
Surface-modified pigments according to Claim 1, 
characterized in that the plateletlike substrate is a

pearl lustre pigment.
Process according to Claim 2, characterized in
that the water-soluble boron-oxygen compound is a salt of

a polyboric acid.
Process according to Claim 2, characterized in
that the boron-oxygen compound is disodium tetraborate.
Process according to Claim 2, characterized in
that the alkali and alkali earth metal salts and the

boron-oxygen compound are used in molar amounts.
Process according to Claim 2, characterized in
that the aftercoating is carried out at temperatures

within the range 20-80Â°C.
Plastics system containing surface-modified
pigments according to Claim 1.
Use of surface-modified pigments according to
Claim 1 for yellowness inhibition in plastics.
