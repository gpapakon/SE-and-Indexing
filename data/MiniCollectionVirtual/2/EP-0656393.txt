flow rate (MFR) of from 0.5 to 30 g/10 min., having (A) 1 to 80 parts 

by weight of an ethylenic polymer which gives an endothermic peak in a 
temperature range of from 80 to 120°C in a temperature rise 

thermogram as measured by a differential scanning calorimeter, has a 
melt flow rate (MFR) of from 0.5 to 50 g/10 min., and is prepared by 

high-pressure radical polymerization, (B) 5 to 80 parts by weight of a 
copolymer of ethylene and an α-olefine containing 3 to 12 carbon 

atoms which gives at least one endothermic peak in a temperature 
range of from 110 to 130°C in the temperature rise thermogram as 

described above, has a melt flow rate (MFR) of from 0.5 to 30 g/10 
min. and a density of from 0.900 to 0.935 g/cm³, and (C) 5 to 70 parts 

by weight of the copolymer of ethylene and an α-olefine containing 3 
to 12 carbon atoms which has a melt flow rate (MFR) of from 0.5 to 30 

g/10 min. and a density of from 0.870 to 0.920 g/cm³ in an unannealed 
state, and gives no endothermic peak at temperatures above 110°C in 

the temperature rise thermogram as described above, and in which a 
ratio of a main component is not less than 80 %; which gives a 

packaging material having significantly improved properties such as 
heat sealability at low temperature, heat-sealing strength, hot 

tacking property and bag breaking strength, and exhibits an excellent 

extrusion processability such as film forming property and extrusion 
loading.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a resin composition for
extrusion molding. More particularly, it relates to a resin composition
for extrusion molding which is used for extrusion molding of a
packaging film or sheet.Polyolefin resins such as low density polyethylenes,
ethylene-vinyl acetate copolymers and ionomers can be heat sealed
at relatively low temperatures and have high heat-sealing strength.
Therefore, they are often used as a heat sealing layer in a packaging
film in the form of a mono layer or a multi-layer with other thin film
material. The laminated films are usually prepared by a process such
as co-extrusion, co-extrusion coating and dry laminating.Recently, high speed packaging is increasingly required in an
automatic packaging system. The high speed packaging means that
heat sealing is completed in a short time, and a period of time from
the heat sealing to the application of a weight of a content in a bag to
the heat-sealed portion is shortened. For this purpose, there is
required a film in which heat-sealing properties can be developed at a
low temperature and no peeling at the sealed portion occurs even if
the weight of the content is applied to the sealed portion when it
remains hot immediately after heat sealing, that is, a film having
excellent hot tacking properties. In laminated films, the heat sealing properties and the hot
tacking properties depend to a large extent on the resin used for
formation of a heat sealing layer while selection of a substrate film
is also important.Among the polyolefin resins, ethylene-vinyl acetate
copolymer is widely used as the heat sealing layer since it exhibits
excellent heat sealability at low temperature in comparison with
low density polyethylene or ionomers. However, it is poor in hot
tacking properties and not satisfactory in heat-sealing strength.Japanese Patent Kokoku No. 41529/1987 and JP-A-57 174 329 describe that, when
a resin composition for extrusion molding comprising (a) a low density
polyethylene, (b) an ethylene-α-olefin copolymer and (c) a low
crystalline to non-crystalline ethylene-α-olefin copolymer is used as
a heat sealing layer, it satisfies the properties required for the heat
sealing layer in packaging materials, for example, heat sealability at
low temperature, heat-sealing strength, hot tacking, strength in bag
breaking. However, concerning heat-sealing strength, hot tacking and
strength in bag breaking, it does not sufficiently satisfy the recent
requirement for the heat sealing layer.It is an object of the present
