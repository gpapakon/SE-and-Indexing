<ABSTRACT>
In a device for rounding the spines of book blocks, having a conveying apparatus which clamps the book block and having a spine-rounding apparatus consisting of rounding elements which, after release of the book block by the conveying apparatus, act on the sides of the book block by means of a defined rotational movement and by means of pressure, rolling rounding segments (40, 40'; 41, 41') are provided which are driven to rotate by drive means and can be vertically displaced on the sides of the book block (1), the vertical movement being superimposed on the rotational movement of the rounding segments (40, 40'; 41, 41'), in the manner such that the vertical movement of the book block (1) achieved as a consequence of the rotational movement is compensated.

segments (10, 11) move in rolling contact on the
toothed racks (12, 13), in that the intermediate

frames (8, 9) are mounted in supporting frames (20)
in a manner that allows horizontal displacement and,

by way of a slotted link (22) fitting onto driving

directions, are actuatable in opposing senses,
in co-ordination with the vertical stroke of the

the rounding elements (2, 2': 3, 3'), and in that
the intermediate frames (8, 9) are movable, with the

rounding elements (2, 2'; 3, 3'), into a functionally
effective position on the book block (1), with concurrent

creation of a contact pressure, and into
a position withdrawn from the book block (1).
Apparatus according to any one of Claims 1 to 6,
characterized in that the rounding radii (R1, R2)

employed for the rounding operation at any given
time can be brought into functionally effective

position by way of an adjustment of the vertical

Apparatus for rounding the spines of book blocks,

which are drive-rotated by actuating means and are
vertically movable, moving in rolling contact on the

sides of the book block (1), the vertical movement
