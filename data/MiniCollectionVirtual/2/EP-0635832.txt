<ABSTRACT>
A cassette holding means with clamping device is proposed, in which means the clamping device comprises a push rod (6) and a clamping wedge (7). The clamping device is attached on a slide (2), which can be pushed in against the force of a spring (8) together with a magnetic tape cassette (4), mounted in the slide (2), into an engaged position. The spring (8) also acts on the push rod (6) of the clamping device and, in the storing position, presses the clamping wedge (7) against the magnetic tape cassette (4). In the removal position, the clamping device is inoperative.

<CLAIMS>
A cassette holder with clamping means, which has a slider that is
arranged to be pushed back on a base plate into a storage position

against the force of a spring, which slider receives a magnetic tape
cassette or similar sound recording medium and which is arranged to be

locked in the storage position, a clamping means clamping the magnetic
tape cassette firmly in the storage position to avoid rattling noises when

vibrations occur, characterized in that the spring (8) acts on an actuating
element (6) of the clamping means mounted on the slider (2), and in the

storage position the actuating element (6) presses against a clamping
element (7) resting laterally against the inserted magnetic tape cassette

(4).
A cassette holder according to claim 1, characterized in that the
actuating element is a push rod (6) running in the direction of travel of the

slider (2), which push rod is displaceable towards a wedge-shaped

clamping member (7) forming the clamping element and arranged
transversely on the slider (2) and pivotable towards the magnetic tape

cassette (4).
A cassette holder according to claim 2, characterized in that the
wedge-shaped clamping member (7), together with the slider (2), forms a

one-piece plastics part and the wedge-shaped clamping member (7) is
surrounded by a U-shaped aperture.
A cassette holder according to one of the preceding claims,
characterized in that the actuating element (6) is guided in a longitudinal

channel (20) of the slider (2) and projects at the rear side (14) thereof with
a receiving part for the spring (8). 
A cassette holder according to one of the preceding claims,
characterized in that, as the spring (8), a torsion spring bears with one

spring arm (9) on the rear side of the cassette holder and with its other
spring arm (10) bears on the actuating element (6), the free end (13) of

the other spring arm (10) projecting beyond the actuating element (6) and
resting against the rear side (14) of the slider (2).
A cassette holder according to one of the preceding claims,
characterized in that in the removal position of the slider (2) the actuating

element (6) releases the clamping element (7) so that the latter is located
in a neutral position.
