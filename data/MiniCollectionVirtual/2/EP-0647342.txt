<ABSTRACT>
Counterfeit objects, such as products or documents, can be detected by checking associated ID numbers, which include one or more appended fields of one or more randomly selected digits, in a database containing the correct authorized ID numbers. This use of random selection makes it impossible for counterfeiters to effectively predict or anticipate correct ID numbers. For example, by using bar coded ID numbers with two distinct appended fields of randomly selected numbers, instead of traditional serial numbers, counterfeit products can be conveniently and positively detected either on a wholesaler's or vendor's shelf using a truncated outside ID number found on the product's packaging, or, for example, upon receipt of a customer's product registration card on which the complete inside ID number is found, this complete inside ID number having been concealed from casual perusal during the product's distribution. If authorized ID numbers are repeated by counterfeiters, "hot" lists are formed and used for immediate detection of counterfeit.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention disclosed herein relates to counterfeit detection
methods.When an object, such as a product or document, is worth disproportionately
more than the cost of its manufacture, it may be counterfeited at a
profit. For example, manufacturers of proprietary products lose billions of
dollars each year because their most successful products are often targeted
by counterfeiters who produce spurious goods locally or overseas. When
counterfeit goods are of similar or identical quality to the original, a
manufacturer suffers from a continuous loss of sales as counterfeiting
continues unchecked, because detection is difficult or impossible. Inferior
counterfeit products may be more easily detected, but in addition to the
above, they also jeopardize future sales of non-counterfeited products by
marring reputation. In either case, the manufacturer's continuing level of
untold lost profits due to counterfeit may be dramatic. Similar concerns
arise with counterfeit documents.A partial listing of products susceptible to being counterfeited includes:
airplane parts; art; auto parts; baby products―formula, diapers, clothing;
books; computers; computer peripherals; cosmetics; designer goods―clothing,
shoes, eye glasses; electronics; entertainment recordings―CDs, records, audio
and video cassettes; games―board, firmware, handheld; military parts; optics
―binoculars, cameras; pharmaceuticals; software; tools; toys; watches.Documents susceptible to fraud (including counterfeit) include: betting
tickets (lottery, sports, etc); bonds (Treasury, commercial, etc); certificates
(birth, gift, warranty, etc); checks (personal, commercial, travelers, etc);
coupons; credit cards; currency; licenses (driver, business, import/export,
etc); passports; scrip (store, amusement park, etc); stamps (postage, food,
etc); stocks; tickets (concerts, sports, theater, etc); travel tickets (airline,
commuter, etc), and so forth.Staggering losses due to counterfeit are estimated. For example, the
International Anti-Counterfeiting Coalition, IACC, located in Washington, 
DC, fears annual losses of $100,000,000,000 (no mistake―one hundred
billion dollars!). On April 23, 1990, U.S. Attorney Stephen J. Markman
reported the following to the IACC:
   "In addition to safety, the economic loss from
counterfeit products is enormous: The big three auto-makers
estimate that they lose 240,000 jobs each year
in the greater Detroit metropolitan area alone due to
counterfeiting of auto parts."Two approaches for detecting counterfeit are:

<CLAIMS>
A method for identifying unauthorized objects comprising:

on at least one less accessible location of each authorized object associating identifying
information therewith which includes at least two distinct randomly selected portions;
on at least one other more accessible location of each authorized object associating said
identifying information therewith but omitting at least one said distinct portion;
storing said identifying information with said at least two distinct portions aside from said
associations with said authorized objects;
reading identifying information from at least one of said locations associated with an
object being checked for authenticity;
comparing said read information with corresponding said stored information to detect one
or more discrepancies therebetween, whereby an unauthorized object is identified.
A method for identifying unauthorized objects comprising:

on at least one less accessible location of each authorized object associating identifying
information therewith which includes at least two distinct randomly selected portions;
in at least one other more accessible location of each authorized object associating said
identifying information therewith but omitting at least one said distinct portion;
storing said information with said at least two distinct portions aside from said
associations with said authorized objects;
reading identifying information from said one other more accessible location associated
with an object being check for authenticity;
comparing said read information from said one other more accessible location with
corresponding said stored information to detect discrepancy therebetween, whereby an

unauthorized object is identified;
reading identifying information including said at least two distinct portions from said at
least one less accessible location associated with an object being checked for authenticity;
comparing said read information from said at least one less accessible location with
corresponding portions of said stored information to detect one or more discrepancies

therebetween, whereby an unauthorized object is identified.
A method for identifying unauthorized objects with outer covering, such as products
with packaging, comprising: 


on at least one location inside said covering of each authorized object associating
identifying information therewith which includes at least two distinct randomly selected portions;
on at least one location on the outside of said covering of each authorized object
associating said identifying information therewith but omitting at least one said distinct portion;
storing said information with said at least two distinct portions aside from said
associations with said authorized objects;
reading identifying information from at least one of said locations associated with an
object being checked for authenticity;
comparing said read information with corresponding said stored information to detect one
or more discrepancies therebetween, whereby an unauthorized object is identified.
A method for identifying unauthorized objects with outer covering, such as products
with packaging, comprising:


on at least one location inside said covering of each authorized object associating
identifying information therewith which includes at least two distinct randomly selected portions;
on at least one location on the outside of said covering of each authorized object
associating said identifying information therewith but omitting at least one said distinct portion;
storing said information with said at least two distinct portions aside from said
associations with said authorized objects;
reading identifying information from at least one location on the outside of an object being
checked for authenticity;
comparing said read information from said outside location with corresponding said stored
information to detect discrepancy therebetween, whereby an unauthorized object is identified;
reading identifying information including at least two said distinct portions from at least
