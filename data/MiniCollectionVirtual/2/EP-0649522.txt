<ABSTRACT>
The description relates to a process and device (10) for producing thin sections (98) cut from a thin-section sample (16) by the cutting blade (20) of a microtome (12), in which the thin sections (98) are transferred to a liquid bath (40). To prevent the undesired compression of the thin sections (98) during the cutting process and also to ensure that they extend properly, the thin sections (98) are transferred from the cutting blade (20) to the liquid bath (40) by a liquid flowing from the blade (20) to the bath (40) at some distance from it. It is thus advantageously possible to divert the flowing liquid as desired by means of a deflecting device (56) to said liquid bath (40) or to a waste container (52) so as to separate "good" thin sections (98) from first cuts, coarse sections or other unsatisfactory thin sections (98) in a simple manner.

A method for producing thin sections (98) cut off by means 
of a cutting knife (20) of a microtome (12) from a thin section 

specimen (16) held by means of a specimen holder (14) of the 
microtome (12), which sections are transferred to a liquid bath 

(40),
characterized in that
 
the transfer of the thin sections (98) from the cutting knife 

(20) to the liquid bath (40) is effected by means of a fluid 
flowing from the cutting knife (20) to the liquid bath (40) 

placed at a distance from the cutting knife (20). 
A method according to claim 1,
characterized in that
 
the transfer of the thin sections (98) is effected by means of a 

fluid flowing in a laminar flow. 
A method according to claim 1 or 2,
characterized in that
 
the liquid of the bath (40) is used as the fluid. 
A method according to one of claims 1 to 3,
characterized in that
 
the fluid is selectably directed by means of a deflection device 

(56) to the liquid bath (40) or to a waste container (52). 
A method according to one of the preceding claims,
characterized in that
 
the mass of the fluid and/or the fluid rate of flow is set 

downstream after the cutting knife (20). 
A method according to one of the preceding claims,
characterized in that
 
the detachment of the rear edge of the thin section (98), or of 

the respective last thin section of a series of thin sections, 
is effected by means of a detachment device (132) provided next  

 
to the cutting knife (20) and being adjustable relative to the 

cutter blade (28) of the cutting knife (20). 
A device for producing thin sections (98) by means of a 
microtome (12) which has a cutting knife (20) and a specimen 

holder (14) provided for a thin-section specimen (16) to be 
thinly cut, which are movable relative to one another, in which 

arrangement a liquid bath (40) is provided for receiving the 
respective thin sections (98),
characterized in that,
 
the liquid bath (40) is provided at a distance from the cutting 

knife (20) and that a flow channel (42) for a fluid is provided 
between the cutting knife (20) and the liquid bath (40), by 

means of which the thin sections (98) can be conveyed, or are 
conveyed, from the cutter blade (28) of the cutting knife (20) 

to the liquid bath (40), in which arrangement the section (82) 
of the cutting knife (20) adjoining the cutter blade (28) 

delimits a cavity (48) of the flow channel (42), from which 
cavity at least one portion of the fluid emerges and flows into 

the flow channel (42). 
A device according to claim 7,
characterized in that
 
the flow channel (42) is designed for an at least approximately 

laminar flow of the liquid. 
A device according to claim 7 or 8,
characterized in that
 
the flow channel (42) has downstream after the cavity (48), a 

bottom (44) and two side walls (46) projecting from the bottom 
(44) and lying opposite each other. 
A device according to claim 9,
characterized in that
 
the bottom (44) and/or the side walls (46) are provided with 

fluid intakes (106, 108) for the selectable setting of the fluid 
mass and/or of the fluid rate of flow in the flow channel (42).  

 
A device according to one of claims 7 to 10,
 
characterized in that
 
a deflection device (56) is provided in the flow channel (42) 

for the selectable direction of the fluid to the liquid bath 
(40) or to a waste container (52). 
A device according to claim 11,
characterized in that
 
the waste container (52) is connected to the cavity (48) adjoining 

the cutting knife (20) by means of a return line (72), 
in which arrangement a conveyance device (70) for the fluid is 

provided in the return line (72). 
A device according to claim 9 and 12,
characterized in that
 
the return line (72) is connected to the fluid intakes (106, 

108). 
A device according to one of claims 10 to 13,
