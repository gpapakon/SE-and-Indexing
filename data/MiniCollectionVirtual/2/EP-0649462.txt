<ABSTRACT>
A substantially non-aqueous liquid cleaning product composition comprises a substantially non-aqueous liquid phase and also comprises a certain kind of polymer. The total composition is shear-thinning (viscosity decreases with shear rate). The equivalent composition without the solids is also shear-thinning but to a lesser or equal extent.

<DESCRIPTION>
 LIQUID CLEANING PRODUCTSTechnical fieldThe present invention relates to substantially non-aqueous liquid cleaning products which comprise a non-aqueous liquid phase, optionally with a dispersed particulate solid material. Non-aqueous liquids are those containing little or no water. The non-aqueous liquid phase may comprise a liquid surfactant and/or a liquid non-surfactant suitable for use in a cleaning product.Background & prior artMost commonly, particulate solids are those which have beneficial auxiliary effects in use, for example for fabrics washing, they may comprise detergency builders to counteract water hardness, as well as bleaches. For hard surface cleaning applications, the solids could comprise abrasive particles.It is also often desired to add one or more ingredients to these systems in order to provide one or more of the following advantages:(a) to improve the solid suspending properties of the system;(b) to reduce the clear layer formation upon storage;(c) to reduce the need of other stabilising materials;(d) to reduce ashing in fabric washing applications;(e) to reduce the consistency of the product; (f) to provide an increased tolerance for high levels of solid materials in the system; and (g) to reduce the setting of the system upon storage.We have now found that improved benefits such as of one or more of the types (a) to (g) recited hereinbefore may be obtained in non-aqueous liquid detergent compositions comprising a specific kind of polymer material. 

EP 413 616 discloses non-aqueous liquids comprising carboxy-containing polymers to provide stability and improved water dispersibility.EP 359 491 and EP 359 492 disclose non-aqueous liquids comprising respectively low and high molecular weight vinylpyrrolidone polymers.EP 28 849 discloses non-aqueous liquids comprising a stabilising polymer that is an at least partially hydrolyzed copolymers of maleic anhydrride with ethylene or vinylmethy1ether.GB 2,228,944 discloses non-aqueous liquids comprising polymeric materials that may comprise acrylamide monomers.Non-pre-published EP 510 762 discloses non-aqueous liquids comprising polymers that may comprise 2-acrylamide-2 methyl propane sulphonic acid as monomer B.Description of the inventionPolymers according to the invention have the property that when added to the non-aqueous liquid phase in the absence of the solids, the viscosity of the liquid phase reduces with shear rate and when added to the same liquid phase in the presence of the solid material, still causes a contribution to
