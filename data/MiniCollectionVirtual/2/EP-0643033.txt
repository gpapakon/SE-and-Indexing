<ABSTRACT>
A multi-purpose distillation column reactor is disclosed 
which may be used for the production of tertiary amyl 

methyl ether from the reaction of the isoamylenes contained 
in a light naphtha with methanol. Two reaction 

distillation zones are disposed above a stripping section. 
The stripping, in addition to removing the TAME product, 

also removes the Câ‚† and heavier components. The first 
reaction distillation zone contains a hydrotreating 

catalyst for removing diolefins and mercaptans. The second 
distillation reaction zone contains an acid cation 

exchange resin for the etherification reaction and the 
entire column serves to fractionate the multiple component 

reaction system (reacts, inerts, products and contaminants) 
concurrently with the multiple reactions.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a multi-purpose 
catalytic distillation column and the use of the column to 
produce an ether from the reaction of an isoolefin with an 
alcohol. More particularly the invention relates to the 
production of tertiary amyl methyl ether by the reaction of 
the isoamylenes contained within a cracked naphtha stream 
with methanol in a distillation column reactor which 
removes the C6+ fraction, sweetens the feed by removing 
mercaptans, removes the nitriles in the feed, selectively 
hydrogenates the dienes in the feed and reacts the 
isoamylenes with methanol to produce tertiary amyl methyl 
ether. The C5 refinery cut is valuable as a gasoline blending 
stock or as source of isoamylene to form an ether by 
reaction with lower alcohols. Tertiary amyl methyl ether 
(TAME) is rapidly becoming valuable to refiners as a result 
of the recently passed Clean Air Act which sets some new 
limits on gasoline composition. Some of these requirements 
are (1) to include a certain amount of "oxygenates", such 
as methyl tertiary butyl ether (MTBE), TAME or ethanol, (2) 
to reduce the amount of olefins in gasoline, and (3) to 
reduce the vapor pressure (volatility). In most C5 cuts the isoamylene suitable for the 
production of TAME is frequently present in small 
quantities, e.g. less than 15%, whereas there are other C5 
olefin isomers and enough dienes and acetylenes to inhibit 
the etherification process. It is an advantage of the 
present invention that the contaminants such as the 
diolefins, acetylenes, mercaptans and nitriles are removed 
before the etherification in the single distillation column  
 
reactor. It is also an advantage that the stream recovered from the column containing the 
ether is suitable without further treatment to be used as an octane blending stock. These and 
other advantages and features of the present invention become clear from the following 
descriptions. US-A-5243102 describes a process for the production of ethers suitable for use as high 
octane oxygenate additives for motor fuels in a multistage catalytic distillation process. The 
heavier paraffins and olefins in the olefin feed stream and a first product ether are 
concentrated into the bottoms stream of the first catalytic distillation zone. The bottoms 
stream and additional alcohol is passed into a second catalytic distillation zone in which the 
heavier isolefin is consumed in the production of a second ether. US-A-5196612 describes a process for producing ethers suitable for use as high
