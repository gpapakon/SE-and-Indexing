<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a plate
exchanging apparatus and method in a rotary printing
press, which automatically removes an old plate from a
plate cylinder and setting a new plate on the plate
cylinder.As a plate exchanging apparatus of this type,
one is generally disclosed in Japanese Patent Laid-Open
No. 11-77968. The plate exchanging apparatus disclosed
in this reference has a cassette which is swingably
supported by frames and has a new plate setting unit for
setting a new plate and an old storage unit for storing
an old plate, and an actuator for reciprocating the
cassette between a plate mounting position and a retreat
position. In this arrangement, when the cassette is
moved from the retreat position to the plate mounting
position by the actuator, the distal end of the cassette
opposes the plate fixing unit of the plate cylinder.
When the plate cylinder rotates almost one revolution
from this state, an old plate whose leading and trailing
edges are released from the plate fixing unit of the
plate cylinder is stored in the old plate storage unit 
of the cassette.In the conventional plate exchanging apparatus
described above, however, the old plate may contact the
inner surface of the old plate storage unit during the
storage of the old plate in the old plate storage unit,
thereby damaging the surface of the old plate.It is an object of the present invention to
provide a plate exchanging apparatus and method in a
rotary printing press, which can prevent damage to the
surface of an old plate during plate removal and bending
of the old plate, thereby reliably reusing the old plate.In order to achieve the above object of the
present invention, there is provided a plate exchanging
apparatus
according to claim 1 and a plate exchanging method according to claim 9.
