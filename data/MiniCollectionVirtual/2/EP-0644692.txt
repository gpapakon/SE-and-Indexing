each group, an audio-data grouping device (102) for processing 
audio data corresponding to the video data into 

groups, each group consisting of audio data items, an 
audio-data compressing device (105) for compressing and 

encoding the audio data items of each group, a sub-video 
data grouping device (104) for processing sub-video data 

into groups, each consisting of sub-video data items, a 
sub-video data compressing device (107) for compressing 

and encoding the sub-video data items of each group, a 
formatter (108) for combining the groups of compressed 

video data items, the groups of compressed audio data 
items and the groups of compressed sub-video data items, 

thereby generating a data unit, data-separating device 
(121) for separating the compressed data items, a speech 

decoder (122) for decoding the encoded video data items, 
an image decoder (123) for decoding the encoded video 

data items, a sub-image decoder (124) for decoding the

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an apparatus and method for
generating a compressed signal and to an apparatus and method for
reproducing compressed signals, which can effectively
operate in a recording/reproducing apparatus using a
magnetic disk, an optikal disk or a CD-ROM as a recording
medium.In recent years, magnetic disks and optikal disks
have been used in various information systems as recording
media for storing a great amount of data. A
number of programs can now be stored on such a disk
thanks to the recent progress in the technology of code-compressing
video data at a high ratio. Various systems
for compresing moving picture data are known. One example
is the system which is defined in ISO-11172
(MPEG).To record more data on a disk, it is desirable not
only to record signals which have been generated by
compression-coding or variable-length coding by
means of the moving-picture compression, but also to
increase the recording density of the data-recording region
of a disk. There is a demand for techniques of
searching and reproducing such signals from a disk.Digital video-information recording/reproducing
systems are disclosed in EP-0 558 848 A2 and in EP-0
558 853 A2. The system according to EP-A-0 558 848
allows recording of information signals such as computer
(SCSI) or MIDI data in addition to digital information
signals such as audio and video signals on a recording
medium in the form of a disk The data is recorded in
the form of a plurality of blocks each comprising an information
portion consisting of a plurality of sub-blocks.
A header portion including a plurailty of identification data
blocks is located preceding the information portion
and respectively associated with the sub-blocks. The
system of this prior art includes one audio decoder and
one video decoder for converting the respective data in
multiple channels from a digital to an analog signal, one
midi decoder for converting the digital data to data conforming
to the MIDI standards and one SCSI decoder
serving as an interface with a microcomputer. The digital
data read from the medium is supplied to the respective
decoders by means of a subblock header identifying circuit.
The system described in EP-0 558 853 A2 is closely related
to the aforementioned system and discloses one
video decoder and a plurality of audio decoders for a
plurality of audio channels.The object of the present invention is to provide an
apparatus and method for generating a compressed signal and an
apparatus and method for reproducing compressed
