<ABSTRACT>
The present invention relates to color 
removal agents comprising water soluble cationic 

polymer dispersions and to their use for the removal 
of color present in waste water effluents, especially from 

effluents discharged by the pulp and paper industries. 
In particular it relates to a 
method for removing color from a paper mill waste 

effluent which comprises the step of adding a low molecular 
weight hydrophobic polymer dispersion to the effluent. The 

hydrophobic dispersion is preferably formed from the 
precipitation polymerization of at least one hydrophilic 

monomer and a hydrophobic monomer in the presence of a 
precipitation aid, water, a chain transfer agent, and an 

initiator.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates generally to color removal agents comprising low
molecular weight water soluble cationic copolymer dispersions and to their use
for the removal of color present in waste water effluents, especially from effluents
discharged by the pulp and paper industries. These low molecular weight
water soluble cationic polymer dispersions are prepared by polymerizing at
least one hydrophilic monomer selected from the group consisting of
(meth)acrylamide and a cationic monomer represented by the following general
formula (II) and a hydrophobic cationic monomer represented by the following
general formula (Ia) in the presence of a precipitation aid, water, a chain
transfer agent and an initiator. The color removal agents of the present invention
exhibit excellent performance in the removal of color caused by lignin. Color removal from the effluent streams of paper mills
continues to be a problem within the pulp and paper
industry. It is necessary that these downstream waste
waters be treated for color removal prior to discharge into
public waterways.The United States wood pulp production capacity is
approximately 60 million tons per year. Since the average
cellulose content of wood is about 40%, 150 million tons of
wood are needed to produce this 60 tons of pulp. The
difference between these two numbers represents the lignin
and hemicellulose which must be removed or separated in the
pulping process in order to free the cellulose fibers.The pulping process, however, does not remove 100% of
the lignin present in the wood, with approximately 5%
remaining after either Kraft or sulfite pulping (for
mechanical pulping the amount is considerably higher). If a
high grade paper is the desired end product, then this 5%
residual lignin must be removed by bleaching the pulp.Since over 35% of the pulp produced in the United
States is bleached, there are about one million tons of
lignin removed each year at the bleach plant, and most of
this in the caustic extraction stage. This number is
significant because in the removal process (i.e., 
bleaching), most of this residual lignin is solubilized.
This solubilized lignin is a strong absorber of visible
radiation resulting from the conjugation of unsaturated and
quinodal moieties formed during the oxidation step in the
bleach plant. Consequently, the bleach plant effluent is
highly colored. Although there are other sources of color
in paper mill waste effluent, it is readily apparent that
where bleaching is performed its effluent can be expected to
be the
