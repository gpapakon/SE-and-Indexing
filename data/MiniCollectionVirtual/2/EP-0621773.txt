<ABSTRACT>
A reduced-toxicity formulation of carotenoids is disclosed which is stable in an aqueous environment. The formulation includes a carotenoid, lipid carrier particles (such as liposomes), and an intercalation promoter agent (such as a triglyceride), which causes the carotenoid to be substantially uniformly distributed with the lipid in the lipid carrier particles. The molar ratio of carotenoid to lipid is greater than about 1:10. Also disclosed is a method of inhibiting the growth of cancer cells, which comprises administering to a living subject a therapeutically effective amount of a composition as described above.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to therapeutic
compositions of carotenoids encapsulated in liposomes or
other lipid carrier particles.It has been known for more than 50 years that
retinoids, the family of molecules comprising both the
natural and synthetic analogues of retinol (vitamin A), are
potent agents for control of both cellular differentiation
and cellular proliferation (Wolbach et al., J. Exp. Med.,
42:753-777, 1925). Several studies have shown that
retinoids can suppress the process of carcinogenesis in
vivo in experimental animals (for reviews, see e.g.,
Bollag, Cancer Chemother. Pharmacol., 3:207-215, 1979, and
Sporn et al., In Zedeck et al. (eds.), Inhibition of Tumor
induction and development, pp. 71-100. New York: Plenum
Publishing Corp., 1981). These results are now the basis
of current attempts to use retinoids for cancer prevention
in humans. Furthermore, there is extensive evidence which
suggests that retinoids can suppress the development of
malignant phenotype invitro (for review, see e.g., Bertram
et al., In: M.S. Arnott et al., (eds.), Molecular 
interactions of nutrition and cancer, pp 315-335. New
York, Raven Press, 1982; Lotan et al., The modulation and
mediation of cancer by vitamins, pp 211-223. Basel: S.
Karger AG, 1983) thus suggesting a potential use of
retinoids in cancer prevention. Also, recently it has been
shown that retinoids can exert effects on certain fully
transformed, invasive, neoplastic cells leading in certain
instances to a suppression of proliferation (Lotan,
Biochim. Biophys. Acta, 605:33-91, 1980) and in other
instances to terminal differentiation of these cells,
resulting in a more benign, non-neoplastic phenotype (see
e.g., Brietman et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A.,
77:2936-2940, 1980).Retinoids have also been shown to be effective in the
treatment of cystic acne (see e.g., Peck, et al., New Engl.
J. Med., 300:329-333, 1979). In addition to cystic acne,
retinoid therapy has been shown to be effective in gram-negative
folliculitis, acne fulminans, acne conglobata,
hidradenitis suppuritiva, dissecting cellulitis of the
scalp, and acne rosacea (see e.g., Plewig et al., J. Am.
Acad. Dermatol., 6:766-785, 1982).However, due to highly toxic side effects of naturally
occurring forms of vitamin A (hypervitaminosis A) at
therapeutic dose level, clinical use of retinoids has been
limited (Kamm et al., In: The Retinoids. Sporn et al.,
(eds.), Academic Press, N.Y., pp 228-326, 1984; Lippman et
al., Cancer Treatment Reports, 71:493-515, 1987). In free
