<ABSTRACT>
This optical device comprises, at the rear of the projectile (3), a reflector (15) equipped with a polariser (16) and, at the firing post (1) of the projectile (3), a light source (5) whose beam illuminates the rear of the projectile (3) and a light flux analyzer (6) deriving the roll angle of the projectile (3) from the direction of polarisation of the light flux reflected by the projectile (3). It is noteworthy in that the polariser (16) is an index changing polariser disposed on the rear of the projectile (3), in front of the reflector (15) with an angle of inclination between the direction normal to its index variation plan and the longitudinal axis of the projectile chosen to be greater than the Brewster angle and in that the light source (5) is offset sideways with respect to the firing axis of the projectile, these two measures resulting in a modulation in the intensity of the reflected light beam depending, apart from 2 pi , on the angle of roll giving different amplitudes to two successive maxima of the analyzer signal allowing them to be differentiated and therefore allowing removal of the  pi  ambiguity resulting from the polarisation direction measurement.

Optical system for the unambiguous measurement of
the roll angle of a projectile (3) launched by launching

means (2) located in a firing station (1), comprising, at
the rear of the projectile (3), a catadioptric device

(15) equipped with a polarizer (16) and, at the firing
station, a light source (5) which is laterally offset in

relation to the firing axis of the projectile (3) and the
beam of which illuminates the rear of the projectile (3),

and a light-flux analyser (6) operating on the light flux
reflected by the rear of the projectile (3), characterized

in that the said polarizer (16) is an index-breaking
polarizer placed at the rear of the projectile (3), in

front of the catadioptric device (15), with an angle of
inclination between the direction normal to its plane of

index variation and the longitudinal axis of the projectile
(3) which is chosen to be greater than the Brewster

angle within a monotonic range of variation of the
transmission factor, the lateral offset of the light

source (5) in relation to the firing axis of the projectile
(3) causing the angle of incidence of the light beam

on the polarizer (16) to vary about the value of the
angle of inclination of the polarizer (16) as a function

of the roll angle, adding, to the change in direction of
polarization of the light beam returned by the projectile

(3) depending to within π on the roll angle, an intensity
modulation depending to within 2 π of the roll angle, in

that the light source (5) and the light-flux analyser (6)
are set so as to deliver a polarization-direction measurement

signal, the maxima of which, corresponding to two 
values separated by π from the roll angle, coincide with

the maximum and the minimum of the intensity modulation
and in that the said light-flux analyser (6) includes

means for distinguishing the two possible maxima in its
measurement signal through their different relative

levels.
System according to Claim 1, characterized in
that the said index-breaking polarizer is a polarizer

with a transparent plate.
System according to Claim 1, characterized in
that the said index-breaking polarizer consists of the

superposition of several transparent plates.
System according to Claim 1, characterized in
that the said index-breaking polarizer is a polarizer

which has several dielectric layers.
System according to Claim 1, characterized in
that the said index-breaking polarizer is a Glan-Thompson

polarizer.
