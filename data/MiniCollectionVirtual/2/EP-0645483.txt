<ABSTRACT>
The feeding-in device, which comprises a holding device, a number of feed bars (23) and drive devices (24), is designed as a constructional unit and can be brought into and out of operative connection with a weaving rotor of a linear-shed weaving loom. For this purpose, the weaving loom has a mounting arrangement for receiving the feeding-in device. The outlay for changing the articles on the weaving loom is thereby reduced.

Warp guiding device for a series-shed weaving machine 
having a weaving rotor (7), which device comprises a 

holding means having a carrier (21) which is mountable 
parallel to the weaving rotor, a number of warp guide 

bars (23) which are arranged on the holding means and 
displaceable in their lengthwise direction and at least 

one driving device (24) for the warp guide bars (23) 
characterised in that, the holding means, the warp guide 

bars (23) and the driving device (24) are realized as a 
constructional unit and in that means (27, 28) are 

provided in order to bring the constructional unit into 
and out of operational connection with the weaving rotor 

(7). 
Device according to claim 1, characterised in that the 
means includes at least one receiving part (27) in order 

to arrange the constructional unit in the weaving 
machine and at least one coupling device (28) in order 

to couple the constructional unit to the weaving rotor 
(7). 
Device according to claim 1, characterised in that the 
driving device (24) has an adjusting device (26) in 

order to align the warp guide bars (23) with respect to 
the weaving rotor (7). 
Device according to one of the claims 1 to 3, 
characterised in that two driving devices (24) are 

provided, and in that each driving device comprises a 
coupling device (28). 
A device according to one of claims 2 or 4, 
characterised in that the coupling device (28) comprises  

 
a gear coupling. 
Series-shed weaving machine having two frame walls (1, 
2) arranged at a distance from each other, a weaving 

rotor (7) which is journalled in the frame walls and a 
warp guiding device according to one of claims 1 to 5, 

characterised in that the weaving rotor (7) has at least 
one coupling member (33) in order to couple the drive 

device (24) of the warp guiding device (6) to the 
weaving rotor (7); and in that each frame wall (1, 2) is 

provided with an installation arrangement (35) with a 
support (37) for the warp guiding device (6), and with a 

positioning means (45) which is connected with the 
installation arrangement (35) in order to bring the 

weaving rotor (7) into and out of operational connection 
with the warp guiding device. 
Weaving machine according to claim 6, characterised in 
that the positioning means (45) comprises a driving 

device (58). 
Weaving machine according to claim 7, characterised in 
that the weaving rotor (7) has two coupling members 

(33). 
Weaving machine according to claim 8, characterised in 
that the coupling member is a rim gear (33) which is 

fixed to the weaving rotor (7). 
Weaving machine according to claim 6, characterised in 
that the installation arrangement (35) comprises a 

support (37) and a fixing device (38) with a quick 
fastener (43) for the fixing of the warp guiding device 

(6).
