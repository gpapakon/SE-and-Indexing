<ABSTRACT>
The present invention relates to a device for protecting a needle (6) in medical equipment. It has a rigid front part (10) connected to a flexible rear part (12). The front and rear parts surround the needle (6) circumferentially. A locking means (36) is accommodated in a chamber (24) provided in the front part (10). In a position of preparedness, the locking means allows the needle (6) to pass through a hole or a channel (14) in the front part (10) and, in an activated position, prevents the needle (6) from passing through. In the position  of preparedness, the parts (10, 12) are spaced from the tip of the needle (6). The novelty of the invention is that the locking means (36) is a resilient member which in the position of preparedness is maintained under tension, exerting a force substantially at right angles to the longitudinal direction of the needle (6), that at least the tip of the needle (6) in the position of preparedness is supported by the hole or the channel (14), the resilient member (36) being thus maintained under tension, and that the resilient member (36), after passing from the position of preparedness to the activated position when the needle (6) is moved rearwards relative to the front part (10), prevents the needle (6) from passing through the hole or the channel (14).

<DESCRIPTION>
 NEEDLE PROTECTION DEVICEThe present invention generally relates to a device for use in infusion cannulas, and more specifically to a device for protecting a needle or the tip of a needle used in such contexts.The existence of contagious or infectious diseases, such as Aids and hepatitis B, which via the blood, other body fluids or tissue parts can infect the nursing staff, makes the treatment/care of patients extremely hazardous, since each patient must be regarded as a potential infec¬ tion source.Since the discovery of HIV, many people in the health service, ambulance personnel, nurses, doctors and others have been infected, e.g. by body contact with or acciden¬ tal pricking by infected needles which have been used in the treatment of blood-infected patients.To protect the nursing staff who is directly involved in the care of such highly infectious patients, extensive efforts have been used for developing syringes and infu¬ sion cannulas, as well as protection devices for use in such syringes and infusion cannulas, with a view to pre¬ venting direct contact with infected needles and safe¬ guarding against accidental needle pricking. One example of such a device is disclosed in US-A- 4,725,267, in which a spring-biased needle tip protection means is moved forwards over the needle tip after the needle has been used. The spring actuating the protection device may be integrated with a flexible tube which pre- vents direct contact with the end of the needle remote from the needle tip.Another example of a protection device of the above- mentioned type is disclosed in DE-A1-38 08 688. A needle tip protection means connected to a flexible tube is moved forwards over the needle after this has been used, and is so angled as to bring the needle tip into a clamped posi¬ tion inside the protection device. The flexible tube is 

 then pulled over the end portion of the needle remote from the needle tip.Further,, protection devices are known in the art which have no flexible tube, but yet cover, that is sur- round, the entire needle. One example of such a device is illustrated in US-A-4,850,994, in which a rigid sleeve- shaped member, which is movable in the longitudinal direc¬ tion of the needle, is moved, after the needle has been used, over the needle, which then is completely surrounded by the sleeve-shaped member in spaced-apart relationship thereto.US-A-4,955,866 discloses a needle tip protection means which is in the form of a cylindrical part surround¬ ing the needle. The cylindrical part is fixed, e.g. by

CLAIMS
1. A device for protecting a needle (6) in medical equipment (2), especially after using this equipment, having a rigid front part (10) with a chamber (16, 24) provided therein and accommodating a locking means (26; 36; 46) which in a position of preparedness allows the needle (6) to pass through a hole or a channel (14) in said front part (10) and which in an activated position prevents the needle (6) from passing through, said front part being connected to a flexible rear part (12), said front and rear parts, when in said position of prepared¬ ness, being spaced from the tip (8) of the needle (6) and surrounding the needle circumferentially, c h a r a c ¬ t e r i s e d in that the locking means accommodated in the chamber (16, 24) is a resilient member (26; 36; 46) which in said position of preparedness is under tension, exerting a force substantially at right angles to the longitudinal direction of the needle (6), that at least the tip (8) of the needle in said position of prepared¬ ness is supported by said hole or channel (14) in the front part (10), the resilient member (26; 36; 46) thus being maintained under tension, and that the resilient member (26; 36; 46), after passing from the position of preparedness to the activated position when the needle (6) is moved rearwards relative to the front part (10), prevents the needle (6) from passing through said hole or channel (14). 2. Device as claimed in claim 1, c h a r a c t e r ¬ i s e d in that the front part (10) at the side facing away from said hole or the mouth of said channel (14) passes into a tubular extension (30), the interior of which forms a portion of said chamber (16), that the tubu- lar extension (30) has an inner diameter considerably exceeding the outer diameter of the needle (6), that the recess or chamber (24) is provided beside the tubular 


 extension (30) with which it communicates, and that the force exerted by the resilient member (26; 36; 46) on the needle (6) in activated position, in which the needle is no longer supported by the channel (14), brings about an angle between the front part (10) or the needle (6) and the longitudinal axis of the device.
3. Device as claimed in claim 1, c h a r a c t e r ¬ i s e d in that the front part (10) at the side facing away from said hole or the mouth of said channel (14) passes into a tubular extension (34), that the tubular extension (34) has an inner diameter which but slightly exceeds the outer diameter of the needle (6), that the tubular extension (34) supports the needle (6) both in the position of preparedness and in activated position, and that the resilient member (26; 46) in activated position extends transversely of the longitudinal direction of the device between opposing side walls of the chamber (16) or the recess or chamber (24), so as to cover the passage to the hole or channel (14). 4.
