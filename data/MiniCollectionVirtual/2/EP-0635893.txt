<ABSTRACT>
A semiconductor light emitter, such as the light-emitting 
diode or the semiconductor laser, having a structure in 

which a light emitting area or an active layer (16); a 
transparent layer (15,17) which is previous to light 

radiated from the light emitting area or the active layer 
(16); and an opaque layer (12,20) or an opaque substrate 

which is impervious to the radiated light are arranged in 
order or in the inverse order. The semiconductor light 

emitter includes (a) total reflection layers(s) (14,18) 
arranged between the transparent layers(s) (15,17) and 

the opaque layer(s) (12,20) so as to come into contact 
with the transparent layer (15,17). The refractive index 

of the total reflection layer (14,18) is smaller than 
that of the transparent layer (15,17). Therefore, at 

least one part of light, which has been radiated from the 
light emitting area or the active layer (16) and which 

has been reflected by the total reflection layer (14,18) 
thereafter, is either radiated outward from side surfaces 

of the transparent layer (15,17) or returned to the 
active layer (16).

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a reflection layer of a
semiconductor light emitter, and more particularly, to a
high effective total reflection layer of a semiconductor
light emitter which is utilized for a light-emitting diode,
a semiconductor laser and so on.In the semiconductor light emitter, such as the lightemitting
diode (LED), the semiconductor laser etc., it is
very important to extract light from inside effectively, in
other words, to improve an outer radiative efficiency, from
a point of obtaining a semiconductor light-emitter of high
power and efficiency.Particularly, in case of using a substrate absorbing light of a
radiative wavelength, it has been devised a countermeasure
to prevent the substrate from absorbing the light by a
provision of a reflecting layer between the substrate and
a light-emitting section, since the light absorption in the
substrate may be one of factors to reduce the outer 
radiative efficiency of the semiconductor light emitter.As an example of the prior art, Fig. 1, shows a
cross-sectional view of an LED having a multi-layer
reflection film arranged on an opaque substrate, thereby
emitting the light from an upper surface of the LED. This
emitter is produced as follows; on the whole surface of an
n-type GaAs substrate 510, n-type AlInP/AlGaInP multi-layer
reflection layers 511 (layer thickness: 0.041µm(AlInP) ;
0.040µm(AlGaInP), 20 pairs), an n-type AlGaInP cladding
layer 512, an undoped AlGaInP emitting layer 513, a p-type
AlGaInP cladding layer 514 and a p-type GaAs contact layer
515 are fabricated in order.Thereafter, a surface electrode 516 is deposited on a
surface of the LED and then the electrode 516 and the p-type
GaAs contact layer 515 are etched except a central portion
of the LED. Further, a back surface electrode 517 is also
deposited on a back surface of the LED.In the above LED, however, since the multi-layer
reflection film affords high reflectivity for only light in
a specific incident direction, i.e., a vertical incident
light in this case, there is caused a problem that, although
a beam p traveling straight downward is reflected by the
multi-layer reflection film to radiate upward, a beam q
traveling downward obliquely is absorbed by the multi-layer
reflection film so that it does not contribute to the 
outward radiation.Further, since the multi-layer reflection film reflects
mainly the light traveling straight downward, the light is
radiated through the upper surface of the LED chip, so that
the amount of light radiated through the side surfaces of
the
