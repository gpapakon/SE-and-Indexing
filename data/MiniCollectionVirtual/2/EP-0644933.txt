<DESCRIPTION>
>•»5 -1-CONSΉTU IYΈ AND INDUCIBLE EPIDERMAL VECTOR SYSTEMSThe invention was partially supported by a grant from the United States government under AR40240 awarded by the National Institutes of 10 Health. The government has certain rights in this invention.¥WΛ,T> OF THE INVENTIONThe present invention relates generally to expression vectors for use in expressing proteins and polypeptides in epidermal cells. More15 particularly it relates to a constitutive vector consisting of the loricrin gene promoter, its 5' flanking region, its 5' transcribed but untranslated region, its intron, its 3' transcribed but untranslated region, its contiguous non-coding DNA containing the gene's natural transcriptional termination region and its 3' flanking region. It further relates to an20 inducible vector consisting of the K6 keratin gene promoter, its 5' flanking region, its 5' transcribed but untranslated region, its first intron, its 3' transcribed but untranslated region, its contiguous non-coding DNA containing the gene's natural transcriptional termination region and its 3' flanking region. Additionally it relates to the treatment of disease25 using the constitutive and inducible vectors.BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTIONThe skin is the largest organ in the human body and, due to its accessibility, it is an attractive target for gene therapy. The outer layer30 of the skin is called the epidermis, and it is particularly attractive since epidermal cells can be grown in vitro from normal and affected patients, 

are easily transformed genetically by vectors, and can be readily reintroduced by autografting. Previous studies investigating the feasibility of using epidermal cells for gene therapy have only considered this ex vivo approach. These investigations utilized retroviral vectors and their promoters to introduce and express foreign genetic material in epidermal cells. Even though the epidermis is avascular, these studies demonstrated that proteins expressed in the epidermis were able to traverse the epidermal-dermal barrier and achieve systemic distribution (Morgan et al., Science, Vol. 237, pp. 1476-1479, (1987)? Feiyves et al., PNAS USA, Vol. 86, pp. 8803-8807, (1989)fGarlick et al., J. Invest. Dermatol., Vol. 97, pp.824-829, (1991)). The accessibility of the epidermis makes it suitable for other routes of vector delivery that do not require an ex vivo approach, e.g.. a gene gun (Sanford et al., Techniques, Vol. 3, pp. 3-16, (1991); Williams et al., PNAS USA, Vol. 88, pp. 2726-2730, (1991); Johnstone et al., In Vitro
