<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a hydroxamic acid 
derivative which is useful as a therapeutic agent for the 
prevention and treatment of diseases caused by the progress 
of connective tissue destruction, a process for the 
production thereof and a pharmaceutical composition 
containing the same. It is considered that collagen and proteoglycan as 
the principal components of mammalian connective tissues are 
degraded by a matrix metalloprotease (MMP) in a specific 
fashion and then by other proteolytic enzymes. Examples of 
known matrix metalloproteases include collagenase (MMP1), 
gelatinase (MMP2), proteoglycanase (MMP3) and the like. It 
is also considered that these matrix metalloproteases, 
together with a tissue inhibitor of metalloprotease (TIMP) as 
their biological inhibiting factor and α₂-macroglobulin, are 
taking a great role in controlling metabolism of connective 
tissues, and that the progress of connective tissue 
destruction occurs when collagen and proteoglycan are 
degraded by the matrix metalloprotease formed in an excess 
amount due to the unbalanced levels of the matrix 
metalloprotease and the biological inhibiting factor.  In consequence, a matrix metalloprotease inhibitor 
which represses tissue destruction through its activity to 
inhibit the aforementioned degradation by matrix 
metalloproteases will be useful for the prevention and 
treatment of diseases which are believed to be caused by the 
progress of connective tissue destruction, such as arthritis 
(e.g., chronic articular rheumatism and osteoarthritis), 
periodontal disease, corneal ulcer, epidermolysis bullosa, 
neoplastic infiltration, abnormal bone resorption and the 
like. A number of studies have been conducted on the 
development of pharmaceutical compounds capable of repressing 
degradation of collagen through their activity to inhibit 
enzyme activity of collagenase, and such compounds so far 
reported are roughly divided into certain phosphoric acid 
derivatives and hydroxamic acid derivatives. Especially, with regard to a hydroxamic acid 
derivative which relates to the compound of the present 
invention, Japanese Patent Application Toppyo Hei. 4-502008 
(international publication WO90/05719) discloses a compound 
represented by the following general formula as a hydroxamic 
acid-based collagenase inhibitor.
