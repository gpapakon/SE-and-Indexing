<ABSTRACT>
A method of producing bearing surfaces from powder metal blanks comprising: blending carbon and ferro alloys and lubricant with compressible elemental iron powder, pressing the blending mixture to form the powder metal blank, high temperature sintering the blank in a reducing atmosphere, compressing the powder metal blanks so as to produce a densified layer having a bearing surface, and then heat treating the densified layer.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a method or process of producing
bearing surfaces on powder metal articles and particularly
relates to such methods including ferro alloy powders.Powder metal technology is well known to the persons
skilled in the art and generally comprises the formation of
metal powders which are compacted and then subjected to an
elevated temperature so as to produce a sintered product.Conventional sintering occurs at a maximum temperature of
approximately up to 1,150°C. Historically the upper
temperature has been limited to this temperature by
sintering equipment availability. Therefore copper and
nickel have traditionally been used as alloying additions
when sintering has been conducted at conventional
temperatures of up to 1,150°C, as their oxides are easily
reduced at these temperatures in a generated atmosphere, of
relatively high dew point containing CO, CO2 and H2. The
use of copper and nickel as an alloying material is
expensive. Moreover, copper when utilized in combination
with carbon as an alloying material and sintered at high
temperatures causes dimensional instability and accordingly
the use of same in a high temperature sintering process
results in a more difficult process to control the
dimensional characteristics of the desired product.Manufacturers of metal powders utilized in powder metal
technology produce pre-alloyed iron powders which are
generally more difficult to compact into complex 
shapes, particularly at higher densities (> 7.0 g/cc). Manganese and chromium can be
incorporated into pre-alloyed powders provided special manufacturing precautions are
taken to minimize the oxygen content, for example, by oil atomization.
Notwithstanding this, these powders still have poor compressabilities compared to
admixed powders.Conventional means to increase the strength of powder metal articles use up to 8%
nickel, 4% copper and 1.5% molybdenum, in pre-alloyed, partially pre-alloyed, or
admixed powders. Furthermore double press double sintering can be used for high
performance parts as a means of increasing part density. Conventional elements are
expensive and relatively ineffective for generating mechanical properties equivalent to
wrought steel products, which commonly use the more effective strengthening alloying
elements manganese and chromium.Moreover, conventional technology as disclosed in United States Patent No. 2,402,120
teach pulverizing material such as mill scale to a very fine sized powder, and thereafter
reducing the mill scale powder to iron powder without
