<ABSTRACT>
The present invention relates to a highly efficient method of preparing modified microcapsules exhibiting selective targeting. These microcapsules are suitable for encapsulation or surface attachment of therapeutic and diagnostic agents. In one aspect of the invention, surface charge of the polymeric material is altered by conjugation of an amino acid ester to the polymer, providing improved targeting of encapsulated agents to specific tissue cells. Examples include encapsulation of hydrophilic radiodiagnostic agents in 1 (my)m capsules to provide improved opacification and encapsulation of cytotoxic agents in 100 (my)m capsules for chemoembolization procedures. The microcapsules are suitable for attachment of a wide range of targeting agents, including antibodies, steroids and drugs, which may be attached to the microcapsule polymer before or after formation of suitably sized microcapsules. The invention also includes hydrophilic microcapsules surface modified with hydroxyl groups. Various agents such as estrone may be attached to the microcapsules and effectively targeted to selected organs.

<DESCRIPTION>
 DESCRIPTIONTHERAPEUTIC AND DIAGNOSTIC USEOF M DIFIED POLYMERIC MICROCAPSULESBACKGROUND OF THE INVENTIONField of the InventionThe invention relates generally to a reproducible, efficient method of preparing nonaggregated microcapsules. The microcapsules are suitable for encapsulation or conjugation with substances useful as diagnostic and therapeutic agents. The invention also relates to amino-acid surface modified microcapsules and microcapsules conjugated with agents having particular potential for drug targeting.Description of Related ArtMicroencapsulation is a well-studied art. It is basically the use of a matrix or encapsulating material to enclose gases, liquids or solids into particles of relatively small size (nanoparticles up to 500 μm) . The matrix is capsular material selected according to the intended use of the microcapsules .Physical properties of encapsulated chemical entities may be modified because of the encapsulation. Other effects of encapsulation include dispersion of one substance within another, stabilization of emulsions and alteration of solubility rate. One of the most useful properties of encapsulated therapeutic materials is controlled release (Wright, et al . , 1989; Wright et al . , 1984) . 

 Microcapsules have been prepared by many methods, including coacervation, interfacial polymerization, mechanical methods, polymer dispersion and matrix encapsulation. Sustained release microcapsules have been prepared from ethylcellulose (Kawashima, et al . , 1984) and poly- (D,L) -lactide (Benita, et al . , 1984) . There is voluminous literature on the preparation and use of encapsulating polymers designed for sustained drug release (Bechtel, 1986; Tice, et al . , 1989) .Although many preparations of microencapsulated compounds have been reported, few describe microparticles in the size range below 10 μm. Particles of 1-250 μm are typically prepared by a solvent evaporation technique (Tice and Gilley, 1985) while sizes from 1-10 μm have been made by emulsion deposition (Smith and Hunneyball, 1986) . One method using solvent evaporation claims to provide a range of sizes from 0.5 - 250 μm (Mosier, 1985) . Nevertheless, none of these methods appears to provide a homogeneous preparation of single-particle, nonaggregated microcapsules. Typical of these preparations is a tendency to aggregate having an overall size of about 177 to 395 μm with 5-162 μm particles making up the aggregates (Jaffe, 1981) . This technique requires sieving to remove larger agglomerates, leaving behind a wide
