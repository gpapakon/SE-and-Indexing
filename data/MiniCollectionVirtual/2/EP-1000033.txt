<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to heterocyclic derivatives, or pharmaceutically-acceptable
salts thereof, which possess antithrombotic and anticoagulant properties and are accordingly
useful in methods of treatment of humans or animals. The invention also relates to processes
for the preparation of the heterocyclic derivatives, to pharmaceutical compositions containing
them and to their use in the manufacture of medicaments for use in the production of an
antithrombotic or anticoagulant effect.The antithrombotic and anticoagulant effect produced by the compounds of the
invention is believed to be attributable to their strong inhibitory effect against the activated
coagulation protease known as Factor Xa. Factor Xa is one of a cascade of proteases involved
in the complex process of blood coagulation. The protease known as thrombin is the final
protease in the cascade and Factor Xa is the preceding protease which cleaves prothrombin to
generate thrombin.Certain compounds are known to possess Factor Xa inhibitory properties and the
field has been reviewed by R.B. Wallis, Current Opinion in Therapeutic Patents, 1993,
1173-1179. Thus it is known that two proteins. one known as antistatin and the other known
as tick anticoagulant protein (TAP), are specific Factor Xa inhibitors which possess
antithrombotic properties in various animal models of thrombotic disease.It is also known that certain non-peptidic compounds possess Factor Xa inhibitory
properties. Of the low molecular weight inhibitors mentioned in the review by R.B. Wallis.
all possessed a strongly basic group such as an amidinophenyl or amidinonaphthyl group.We have now found that certain heterocyclic derivatives possess Factor Xa
inhibitory activity. Many of the compounds of the present invention also possess the
advantage of being selective Factor Xa inhibitors. that is the enzyme Factor Xa is inhibited
strongly at concentrations of test compound which do not inhibit or which inhibit to a lesser
extent the enzyme thrombin which is also a member of the blood coagulation enzymatic
cascade.The compounds of the present invention possess activity in the treatment or
prevention of a variety of medical disorders where anticoagulant therapy is indicated, for
example in the treatment or prevention of thrombotic conditions such as coronary artery and 
cerebro-vascular disease. Further examples of such medical disorders include various
cardiovascular and cerebrovascular conditions such as myocardial infarction, the formation of
atherosclerotic plaques, venous or
