<ABSTRACT>
This invention aims to provide a waterproof casing 
which can keep its waterproof function under a great change 

of temperature. In the waterproof casing, a lid (20) which 
covers an opening in a body (10) is provided with a pipe (24) 

which intercommunicates an interior and an exterior of the 
casing. A porous waterproof filter (25) closes a port (24a) in 

the pipe (24). Air in the body (10) is expanded and contracted 
under changes in temperature. However, only air can pass 

through the filter (25) into and out of the body (10) with water 
being precluded, thereby waterproofing the interior of the 

casing.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a waterproof casing and
more particularly to a waterproof casing suitable for
accommodating an electronic unit in an engine compartment
in a vehicle.In the case of accommodating in a casing a device
which must be waterproofed, a casing having a simple box
like construction is unable to effect waterproofing of the
device under an environment where the ambient temperature
is subject to rapid changes. Since a pressure within the
casing changes in response to a temperature change, the
casing is deformed and water enters into the interior of
the casing through clearances between a body and a lid
for sealing the interior of the casing.Heretofore, some waterproof casings which are
used under such circumstances are known by Japanese Utility
Model Public Disclosure Nos. 56-112978 (1981) and 57-186094
(1982). These casings are not formed into a sealed construction
but they are provided with a vent hole in order
to equalize the pressure in the interior and exterior of
the casing. One casing disclosed in the former reference
is provided with a labyrinth vent hole which retains water
entering thereinto, while another casing disclosed in the
latter reference is provided with a zigzag vent hole in
which baffle boards are arranged in a zigzag manner in
order to prevent water from entering into the interior
of the casing.One example of such a waterproof casing is that
which may be used to protect an electronic control device
for an engine from contamination with water when the device
is disposed in an engine compartment. In such an engine
compartment, the waterproof casing is subject to high
temperatures generated by the engine and low temperatures
from water which enters into the compartment during driving. 
In this case, the conventional waterproof casings have the following
problems.In the former casing the labyrinth vent hole can not hold a large
amount of water while the zigzag vent hole in the latter casing can not
baffle a high pressure of water.We are aware of EP-A-0377066 which is considered as the closest
prior art. This has been used as the basis of the pre-characterising
portion of claims 1 and 2.An object of the present invention is to provide a waterproof casing
which can maintain an effective waterproofing function under a
circumstance in which an ambient temperature is rapidly changed.In order to achieve the above object, a first aspect of the invention
provides a waterproof casing which accommodates an electronic unit to be
waterproofed, the casing comprising a box like body
</DESCRIPTION>
<CLAIMS>
A waterproof casing which accommodates an electronic unit to be
waterproofed, the casing comprising a box like body member (10) having

an opening and a lid member (20) for covering the opening in the body
member, in which one of the members comprises a pipe (24) which

extends in the interior of the casing to form a communication hole which
is closed with a porous waterproof filter (25), characterised in that the

body member further comprises apertures (17a) for accommodating
connectors (42a) for the electronic unit to pass and extend outwardly

through the body member (10); further comprising a flange (11) provided
on a periphery of the opening and a plurality of ribs (12) on a front side

on the flange (11) which prevent the casing from being deformed due to
changes in temperature to prevent the formation of clearances through

which water can enter the housing.
A waterproof casing which accommodates an electronic unit to be
waterproofed, the casing comprising a box like body member (10) having

an opening and a lid member (20) for covering the opening in the body
member, in which one of the members comprises a pipe (24) which

extends in the interior of the casing to form a communication hole which
is closed with a porous waterproof filter (25), characterised in that the

body member further comprises apertures (17a) for accommodating
connectors (42a) for the electronic unit to pass and extend outwardly

through the body member (10); and in which a support wall (16) is
provided on the lid (20) which projects towards the opening in the

body (10), the support wall (16) closely contacting an inner peripheral
wall in the opening so as to serve to prevent the opening portion of the

body from being deformed due to changes in temperature to prevent the
formation of clearances through which water can enter the housing. 
A waterproof casing according to claim 1 or claim 2, in which the
pipe (24) is provided in the lid member (20).
A waterproof casing according to any preceding claim,
characterised in that the casing is suitable for accommodating an

electronic unit to be waterproofed in an engine compartment in a vehicle,
and in which a flange (11) is provided on the body member (10) around

the opening.
