<ABSTRACT>
An electrographic copying machine in which an image 
projected on an original glass stand (7) by a film projector 

(1) is read out by a scanner (8) and copied is provided with 
a color scanner including a CCD for reading out a projected 

image, a smoothing processsing unit (20) for averaging the 
tone data of pixels outputted from the color scanner every 

four pixels, a difference value totaling unit (24) for 
totaling the difference values between the averaged tone 

data, and a control unit for performing focusing of the film 
projector so that the total of the difference values is 

maximum. The focusing of the projected image is automatically 
performed.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an electrographic copying 
machine where an image on an original glass stand projected by 
a film projector is read out by a scanner and copied, and more 
particularly, to a digital color electrographic copying machine. Conventionally, such a film projector is set on a digital 
color electrographic copying machine as shown in Fig. 10. 
Reference numeral 1 represents a projector body incorporating a 
lamp (not shown) serving as a light source, a projector lens 2 
and a loading portion 3 in which positive or negative film 
(mounted or stripped film) is loaded. Reference numeral 4 
represents a mirror unit including a reflecting mirror 5 and a 
Fresnel lens (dispersing plate) 6. Light from the lamp is 
irradiated onto the film. Light transmitted by the film is 
directed to an original glass stand (contact glass) 7 of the 
copying machine by way of the projector lens 2, the reflecting 
mirror 5 and the Fresnel lens 6 to thereby project the image on 
the film onto the original glass stand 7. To project an in-focus image on the original glass stand 7, 
it is necessary to adjust the position of the projector lens 2. 
Conventionally, whether an in-focus image is projected or not is 
determined by reading out an image on the original glass stand 
7 by a color scanner 8 of the copying machine, and by a control 
signal based on a result of the determination, the position of  
 
the projector lens 2 is automatically adjusted (what is called, 
automatic focusing). To adjust the position of the projector 
lens 2, a stepping motor 9 of the projector body 1 is driven as 
shown in Fig. 11 by a control signal from the copying machine to 
move a cylinder 13 for holding the projector lens 2 backward and 
forward by variable speed gears 10, 11 and 12 and a teeth 
portion 13A. Specifically, the projector lens 2 is moved by the stepping 
motor 9 from a home position (the forefront) to the rearmost end 
by a predetermined step while a charge coupled device (CCD) of 
R, G, B line structure of the color scanner 8 is located in the 
vicinity of the center of the projection area (image). During 
the movement of the projector lens 2, image data are read out by 
the CCD at each step position. In this case, 8-bit green image 
data (256 tones) of approximately 4800 pixels are read out for 
one line. Then, difference values of image data are obtained 
for 4800 pairs of adjoining pixels. The projector lens 2 is 
moved and fixed to a step position where the total of the 
difference values is maximum. For
