<ABSTRACT>
Knurled surfaces such as raised ribs (24, 30) are provided on the shell (12) of a soft gelatin capsule (10) in order to enhance gripping and manipulation of the capsule (10). The capsule (10) has a removable tab (14) at one end thereof which may also be provided with a knurled surface (30). One embodiment of the invention is a capsule (10) used for delivery of medicaments to an external body surface. An alternative embodiment of the capsule (10) is disclosed for insertion into a body orifice. The composition of the capsule (10) includes a starch or starch derivative which gives the capsule (10) a drier feel and increases the coefficient of friction of the surface of the shell (12) further improving the capsule's handling characteristics.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to soft gelatin 
medicament capsules, and particularly to such capsules 
of the type from which a medicament is discharged after 
removal of a tab closing an expulsion port. Soft gelatin capsules are used for delivery of 
medicaments, including medicinal preparations, topical 
lotions, cosmetics and the like, to external body 
surfaces. Such capsules are also used for delivery of 
medicaments to tissues within body orifices. Delivery 
of the medicament, which is stored within the capsule, 
is accomplished by removing a portion of the capsule 
shell (typically by twisting or tearing off a tab), and 
then squeezing the capsule shell, thereby forcing the 
medicament from the capsule. Typical soft gelatin 
capsules are disclosed in U.S. Patent Nos. 2,134,489; 
2,334,600; 2,379,051; 4,278,633; and 5,063,057. Soft gelatin medicament capsules are often small in 
size since only a small quantity of medicament is stored 
therein. Further, because they are typically composed 
largely of gelatin or gelatinous materials, their 
exterior surfaces have low coefficients of static 
friction. As a consequence, a user often has difficulty 
in performing the tasks required to complete the 
delivery of the medicament, that is, twisting or tearing 
off of the tab and compressing the capsule shell. This 
difficulty is even more compounded if the user's hands, 
or the capsule, are wet or oily, for example, due to 
bodily excretion or lubrication. The present invention is based on medicament 
capsules of the above type, comprising a flexible hollow 
shell having a bulb with a tapered section leading to a 
removable tab integrally formed therewith, the junction 
between the tab and the tapered section defining an 
expulsion port. According to the invention, the 
external surface of each of the bulb and tab is provided 
with a knurled texture region. In use, the medicament 
is expelled from the shell upon removal of the said tab  
 
and application of pressure to the shell. Since the 
shell and the tab have knurled surfaces, the 
difficulties of use associated with prior art capsules 
is largely eliminated. In one embodiment of the invention, the bulb is 
formed as an elongate body having top and bottom 
flattened portions, with a knurled texture region on 
both the top and bottom flattened portions. In another 
embodiment the capsule is shaped to be suitable for 
insertion into an orifice, such as the rectum. In this 
embodiment, the bulb forms an elongate neck portion 
terminating adjacent the

A soft gelatin capsule (10) containing a 
medicament, and comprising a flexible hollow shell 

having a bulb (12, 40) with a tapered section leading to 
a removable tab (14, 42) integrally formed therewith, 

the junction between the tab (14, 42) and the tapered 
section defining an expulsion port,
 
CHARACTERISED IN THAT
 
the external surface of each of the bulb (12, 40) and 

tab (14, 42) is provided with a knurled texture region 
(18, 28, 48, 50). 
A capsule according to Claim 1 wherein the 
medicament comprises a hemorrhoidal treatment. 
A capsule according to Claim 1 or Claim 2 
wherein the knurled texture regions comprise at least 

one rib (24, 30, 48, 50) applied to the exterior surface 
of the shell. 
A capsule according to Claim 3 wherein said at 
least one rib (24, 30, 48, 50) extends around the shell. 
A capsule according to any preceding Claim 
wherein the bulb (12) is in the form of an elongate body 

having top and bottom flattened portions (20, 22) to 
both of which is applied a knurled texture region (18). 
A capsule according to Claim 5 wherein the 
elongate body defines a central axis, and wherein at 

least one rib (24) is applied to each of the upper and 
lower flattened portions (20, 22) in an orientation 

transverse to said axis. 
A capsule according to any preceding Claim 
wherein the tapered section of the bulb (40) forms an 

elongate neck portion for insertion into an orifice 
after removal of the tab. 
A capsule according to any preceding Claim 
wherein the material of the shell (10) comprises gelatin 

and a starch or starch derivative in the range 0.1% to 
30% by weight of said material.
