Arrangement of an acoustic antenna (1) on the 
hull of a naval vessel for receiving low-frequency 

undersea waves, which includes at least one surface 
sensor formed by a stack of conducting layers (12) 

forming electrodes and of dielectric layers (13) of 
piezoelectric material interposed between these 

conducting layers, this sensor being enclosed in a 
sheathing of flexible material (9, 10, 11), the assembly 

thus constituted forming an attached flat panel (2) 
mounted against the wall of the hull (5) of a naval 

vessel, especially of a submarine, this panel exhibiting 
a degree of freedom in bending so as to allow it to 

follow the shape of this hull, characterized in that the 
panel is mounted on the hull while leaving an intermediate 

water layer (6) between panel (2) and hull (5), 
the thickness of this water layer being such that the 

distance separating the wall of the hull from the mid-plane 
of the sensor is less than a quarter of the wavelength 

of the maximum frequency of the operating band of 
the sensor. 
The arrangement of Claim 1, in which the sensor 
is subdivided into a plurality of elementary sensors, 

some of which have their respective electrodes 
electrically linked in parallel, the set of elementary 

sensors being placed in a common sheathing. 
The arrangement of Claim 2, in which the 

conducting layers of the elementary sensors are formed 
from a single strip machined in such a way as to divide  

 
it into separate elementary plates (15) while leaving, 

between adjacent elementary plates, at least one bridge 
of material (16) remaining, providing the electrical link 

between the electrodes of these various elementary 
sensors. 
The arrangement of one of Claims 1 to 3, in which 
the mounting of the panel on the hull is achieved by 

means of 4 clamps mounted on two rails (3 and 4). 
The arrangement of one of Claims 1 to 4, in which 
the sheathing of flexible material comprises an envelope 

of flexible material (10, 11) filled with a viscoelastic 
lining material (9). 
The arrangement of Claim 5, in which the viscoelastic 
lining material (9) is a polyurethane material 

with soft consistency, the Shore hardness of which is 
less than 50, of which the density-speed product, as well 

as the Poisson ratio, are close to that of water. 
The arrangement of one of Claims 1 to 6, in which 
the piezoelectric material of the dielectric layers (13) 

of the sensor is a film of polyvinylidene fluoride. 
The arrangement of Claim 7, in which the stack of 
the conducting layers (12) and of the dielectric layers 

(13) is produced by bonding the film of polyvinylidene 
fluoride onto the adjacent conducting layers. 
The arrangement of one of Claims 1 to 8, in which 
the material of the conducting layers (12) is a copper-beryllium 

alloy. 
The arrangement of Claim 1, in which the independent 
sensors are electrically linked by a flexible 

circuit.
