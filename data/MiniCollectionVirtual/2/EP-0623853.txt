<ABSTRACT>
A lithographic printing plate precursor and process 
for its utilization have been discovered through which 

negative and positive original images can be printably 
reproduced on the plate precursor in substantially fewer 

development steps. The precursor plate is exposed 
sequentially to either the negative or positive original 

with the resultant image subsequently developable in a 
single process or step. The process is achieved by using 

a precursor plate having two coatings of significantly 
different photographic sensitivity to light, i.e., speed 

as characterized by "camera speed" or "contact speed" and 
imagewise exposing the originals in sequence to 

alternative speeds. The contact speed coating may be 
negative-working or positive working while the camera 

speed coating is negative-working. The camera speed 
coating is developed followed by exposure of the contact 

speed coating. Images produced at camera speed are 
removed and non-image bearing portions of the contact 

speed coating are removed. The remaining image areas 
corresponding to the negative and positive originals are 

treated to provide positive printable images.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates 
to a process for the formation of 
printable images on a lithographic plate from negative 
and positive originals employing a single development 
step. More specifically, the invention relates to a 
printing plate having a silver halide coating and a non-silver 
halide coating and to a process for producing 
printable images from negative and positive originals. The prepress operations associated with lithographic 
printing plate production are demanding and becoming 
increasingly complex. Depending on the demands and 
preferences of the customer, printers may be required to 
use both negative and positive original transparencies as 
the input materials to produce a finished plate. 
Additionally, the high quality of the finished plate must 
be maintained regardless of the type of original input 
and must be commensurate with the need to produce copies 
that may number in the millions. However, as a 
consequence of these increasing requirements, both 
unipolar and bipolar plates are now available to the 
printing industry so that a single negative or positive 
original (unipolar) or both negative and positive 
originals (bipolar) can be used as input for printing 
plate image production. Known unipolar plates comprise 
generally a single photosensitive layer on a hydrophilic 
substrate. Known bipolar plates comprise generally at 
least two photosensitive layers on a hydrophilic 
substrate and are known in the art as bilevel plates, 
referring to the two photosensitive layers.  
 Currently, if the printer uses a conventional 
unipolar plate such as a negative working or a positive 
working plate to reproduce a negative and a positive 
original, i.e., bipolar reproduction, one of the original 
input materials must be converted to suit the final plate 
mode. This is expensive and time consuming. If the 
printer resorts to the use of a bipolar plate as 
available in the art heretofore for reproduction of 
images from negative and positive originals, additional 
process steps in development, masking or exposure are 
invariably required which renders this alternative 
expensive and time consuming as well. The additional 
steps required in the present art of bipolar printing 
plate utilization flow from the fact that in order to 
obtain the requisite positive images on the final 
printing plate from a negative and a positive original 
input, a reversal of one of the original images needs to 
be accomplished during the photographic image transfer 
process. Artisans in the photographic
