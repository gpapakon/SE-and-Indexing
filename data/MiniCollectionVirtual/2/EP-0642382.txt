<ABSTRACT>
A reactor system suitable in particular for a model of a gastrointestinal tract comprises one or more units (1), each consisting of two or more pressure chambers (2, 3) and in each of said pressure chambers a hose (5) made of flexible material and open at both ends, which hoses are fixed with their ends sealed in such a way that the spaces (6) between the wall of the pressure chambers and the hoses are closed. Connection means (8, 9) are also present for supplying a gas or liquid to and discharging it from the spaces (6) between the wall of the pressure chambers and the hoses, and coupling means are present for coupling the pressure chambers to each other and/or to end pieces or intermediate pieces (4). Fially, connection means (10, 11) are present in the end pieces or intermediate pieces for supplying constituents to and discharging them from the hoses.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a peristaltically mixing reactor system
suitable for a model for a gastrointestinal tract.Reactor systems often consist of a pot or tank in which a stirring
element is disposed. The digestion process in the gastrointestinal
tract, for example, can be simulated only very imperfectly with such a
system. In particular, the peristaltic movements which contribute to
the homogenization and transfer of substances are absent.The object of the invention is to provide a peristaltically mixing
reactor system in which in particular highly viscous liquids can be
mixed and homogenized, and which system is suitable in particular for
assembling a model for a gastrointestinal tract.According to the invention the peristaltically mixing reactor system
comprises for this purpose:
at least one unit consisting of two or more pressure chambers;in each of the pressure chambers a hose made of flexible material and
open at both ends, which hoses are fixed with their ends sealed in
such a way that the spaces between the wall of the pressure chambers
and the hoses are closed;connection means for supplying a gas or liquid to and discharging it
from the spaces between the wall of the pressure chambers and the
hoses;coupling means for coupling the pressure chambers to each other to end
pieces or intermediate pieces;connection means in the end pieces or intermediate pieces for
supplying constituents to and discharging them from the hoses.The medium in the spaces between the wall of a pressure chamber and a
hose can also be used for heating of the constituents taking part in 
the reaction.In order to be able to control both the frequency and the force of the
peristaltic movements accurately, control means can be used to raise
and lower the pressure in the closed spaces between a pressure
chambers wall and a hose. These control means will usually consist of
computer-controlled pumps.The volume of the reactor system can be adapted to requirements,
through the fact that the number of pressure chambers per unit and the
number of units can be varied. The system is preferably modular, i.e.
the supply of constituents to and discharge thereof from the system
can be handled by means of standardized end pieces and intermediate
pieces and the system can be expanded in a simple way, inter alia by
means of a peristaltic flap valve pump based on the principle of the
invention.It is pointed out that FR-A-2640698 discloses a peristaltic flap valve
comprising three or more pressure chambers, each with a flexible hose
fixed
