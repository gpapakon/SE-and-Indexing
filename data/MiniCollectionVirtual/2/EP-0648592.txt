<ABSTRACT>
Disclosed is a porous film manufacturing apparatus 
which is obtained by further improving an already filed 

porous film manufacturing apparatus and which can regularly 
form a large number of non-through pores (16) with 

a fine opening width of sub-µm to several tens µm at 
a high density in elongated films (13) made of various 

materials, with almost no deterioration in the essential 
characteristics of the film materials. This porous film 

manufacturing apparatus includes a feed unit for feeding 
an elongated film (13), a perforating unit including a 

first block (2) having a surface on which a large number 
of diamond particles (3) with acute corner portions are 

deposited, a second block (10) having a surface on which 
a desired protruding pattern (11) is formed, and an 

elastic organic polymer sheet (12) so arranged as to 
cover at least the protruding pattern (11) of the second 

block (10), the first and second blocks (2, 10) being 
arranged such that the particle-deposited surface of the 

first block (2) and the organic polymer sheet (12) 
oppose each other, and a pressurizing unit for moving 

the movable block toward the stationary block until the 
distance between projecting ends of the particles (3) 

and the surface of a portion of the organic polymer 
sheet (12) located on the protruding pattern (11) 

becomes smaller than the thickness of the elongated 

film (13) fed to a position between the movable and 
stationary blocks, thereby pressing the acute corner 

portions of the particles (3) into the elongated film 
(13) in a region opposing the protruding pattern (11).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a porous film
manufacturing apparatus and, more particularly, to an
apparatus for manufacturing porous films suitable for,
e.g., an easily tearable film and a gas permeability-controlled
film.French Patent 2073807 discloses a thermoplastic
film fine perforation method including the steps of providing
a pair of rolls which have a pinching portion
between them and between which a fixed distance is held,
applying abrasive particles on the surface of one of the
rolls, passing a thermoplastic film through the pinching
portion of the rolls, perforating the film with the
abrasive particles by adjusting the pressure and the
temperature of the pinching portion of the rolls, finely
perforating the film with corner portions of the abrasive
particles in contact with the film, and removing
the finely perforated film from the pinching portion of
the rolls. The abrasive particles on the surface of one
of the pair of rolls are applied by bonding sandpaper,
such as garnet type sandpaper, on the circumferential
surface of the perforating roll. In this apparatus,
however, if the pair of rolls are brought into contact
with each other and a thermoplastic film is passed
between the rolls, the garnet type sandpaper adhered as
abrasive particles on the surface of one of the rolls is
damaged by perforation in a short time period, since the 
strength of the sandpaper itself is low. As a result,
it is difficult to continuously form through pores in
thermoplastic films over long periods of time.German Patent No. 2,830,402 discloses a method by
which a large number of through pores are formed in a
polyethylene or polypropylene film by passing the film
through a pinching portion between a hard roll, which is
covered with hard particles such as corundum particles
or SiC particles, and a counter roll. According to this
German Patent, the resultant film is applied to tea
bags.The applicant of the present invention, on the
other hand, has previously filed a porous film manufacturing
apparatus comprising: feed means for feeding an
elongated film; a perforating unit including a first
rotatable roll having a surface on which a large number
of particles, each having acute corner portions and a
Mohs hardness value of 5 or more, are deposited, and a
second roll which is rotatable in a direction reverse to
a rotating direction of the first roll, the first and
second rolls being arranged to oppose each other and to
cause the elongated film to pass therebetween, one of
the rolls being stationary and the other
