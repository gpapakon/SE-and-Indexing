<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a flexible heat transfer device for dissipating heat from electrical or electronic components or their heat sinks or housings (casings) into adjacently located heat sink areas, housing areas or chassis of electrical/electronic apparatuses, comprising at least one section of a heat conductive film made of insulation material, one section of a metallic foil (3) or of a metallic layer [lacuna], which section extends at least parallel to the heat conductive film (2) in sections and, with the latter, forms a flexible composite body (1, 4, 6, 8, 11) having at least two layers. Such a design improves the heat transfer coefficients of electronic components into the film, through the film and into dissipation bodies, as well as the overall mechanical properties of the film.
