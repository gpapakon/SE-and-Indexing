<ABSTRACT>
A gas burner has a burner head (1) for bringing together a fuel gas flow and a combustion air flow, a fuel gas supply pipe, by means of which fuel gas can be guided to the burner head (1), and a combustion air supply pipe, by means of which combustion air can be guided to the burner head and which is arranged, with a radial spacing, coaxially with the fuel gas supply pipe, forming an annular space. To guarantee homogeneous combustion with high efficiency, there are formed, in an inner central part (2) of the burner head (1) connected to the burner head-side end of the fuel gas supply pipe or of the combustion air supply pipe, outlet openings (15), through which the fuel gas flow or the combustion air flow can be emitted into a burner head annular space (5) which extends between the burner head-side end of the combustion air supply pipe or of the fuel gas supply pipe and the outlet area (14) of the burner head (1), essentially in the axial direction of the fuel gas supply pipe or of the combustion air supply pipe, and in the region of which assigned to the outlet openings (15) of the inner central part (2) of the burner head (1) the combustion air flow or fuel gas flow flowing through the burner head annular space (5) essentially in the axial direction of the fuel gas supply pipe or of the combustion air supply pipe can be acted upon with the fuel gas flow or combustion air flow emerging from the outlet openings (15) of the inner central part (2) of the burner head (1).
