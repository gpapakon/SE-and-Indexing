<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to selected novolaks 
prepared via a two-stage process which contain high 
levels of ortho-ortho methylene bridge bonding. In 
the first stage, a low molecular weight oligomeric 
prepolymer with high ortho-ortho bonding is formed 
via a noncatalyzed reaction of phenolic monomers 
with an aldehyde source under elevated temperatures 
and pressures. In the second stage, the oligomeric 
prepolymer is extended to higher molecular weights 
to obtain a novolak resin with desirable alkaline 
solubility, molecular weight and ortho-ortho bonding 
properties. These novolaks can also be fractionated 
to further improve their lithographic properties. Furthermore, the present invention relates to 
radiation-sensitive compositions useful as 
positive-working photoresist compositions, 
particularly those containing these phenolic resins 
and o-quinonediazide photosensitizers. Still 
further, the present invention also relates to 
substrates coated with these radiation-sensitive 
compositions as well as the processes of coating, 
imaging, and developing these radiation-sensitive 
mixtures on these substrates. Photoresist compositions are used in micro-lithographic 
processes for making miniaturized 
electronic components such as in the fabrication of 
integrated circuits and printed wiring board 
circuitry. Generally, in these processes, a thin 
coating or film of a photoresist composition is  
 
first applied to a substrate material, such as 
silicon wafers used for making integrated circuits 
or aluminum or copper plates of printed wiring 
boards. The coated substrate is then baked to 
evaporate any solvent in the photoresist composition 
and to fix the coating onto the substrate. The 
baked coated surface of the substrate is next 
subjected to an image-wise exposure of radiation. 
This radiation exposure causes a chemical 
transformation in the exposed areas of the coated 
surface. Visible light, ultraviolet (UV) light, 
electron beam and X-ray radiant energy are radiation 
types commonly used today in microlithographic 
processes. After this image-wise exposure, the 
coated substrate is treated with a developer 
solution to dissolve and remove either the 
radiation-exposed or the unexposed areas of the 
coated surface of the substrate. In some instances, 
it may be desirable to bake the imaged coated 
substrate after the imaging step and before the 
developing step. This bake step is commonly called 
a post-exposure bake and is used to increase 
resolution. There are two types of photoresist
