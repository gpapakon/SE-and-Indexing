<ABSTRACT>
An apparatus and method for providing proper 
electrical contact between corresponding interconnect pads 

(61, 85) of a print cartridge (24, 25, 26 or 27) and a 
print carriage (30) are disclosed. A flexible insulating 

tape (87) with interconnect pads (85) is supported by an 
elastomeric compensator (94) that has columns (114) with 

hemispherical domes on the side (115) of the elastomeric 
compensator (94) facing the tape (87) and a flat surface 

(118) on the other side. The flat surface (118) of the 
elastomeric compensator (94) is supported by a gimbal 

plate (102) which, in turn, is supported by a spring 
(106).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates generally to printers
and, more particularly, to a method and apparatus for
ensuring good electrical contact between interconnect pads
on a print cartridge and the corresponding interconnect
pads in the stall of a print carriage. Inkjet printheads operate by ejecting a droplet of
ink through a nozzle and onto a recording medium, such as
a sheet of paper. When a number of nozzles are arranged
in a pattern, such as a rectangular matrix, the properly
sequenced ejection of ink from each nozzle causes
characters or other images to be printed on the paper as
the printhead is moved relative to the paper. The
printhead is usually part of a disposable print cartridge
containing a supply of ink. The print cartridge is
designed for easy installation and removal from a stall in
a print carriage. Print cartridges are installed and
removed hundreds of times over the life of a print
carriage.In one type of thermal inkjet print cartridge, the
print cartridge includes: 1) an ink reservoir and ink
channels to supply ink proximate to each of the nozzles;
2) a printhead in which the nozzles are formed in a
desired pattern; 3) a substrate attached to a bottom
surface of the printhead, a series of thin film heater
resistors being formed on the substrate, generally one
resistor below each nozzle and 4) interconnect pads formed
on an insulating tape with which electrical connections
are made to corresponding interconnect pads on the print
carriage.To print a dot of ink from a nozzle, an electrical
current is passed through paired interconnect pads of the
print carriage and the print cartridge to a selected
resistor of the print cartridge. The heater is ohmically
heated, in turn heating a thin layer of adjacent ink.
This results in vaporization of the ink, vapor bubbles in
the ink causing a droplet of ink to be ejected through an
associated nozzle onto the paper. The resistors in the
substrate are connected by conductors formed on the
insulating tape to interconnect pads on the insulating 
tape. The interconnect pads, the conductors and the
insulating tape are collectively known as the TAB circuit,
since the insulating tape is bonded to the printhead by
the well-known tape automated bonding (TAB) process.There are several problems associated with the prior
art devices that result in inadequate electrical contact
between corresponding interconnect pads. In the prior art, the
interconnect pads of the print carriage were terminal
points of a circuit formed on a flexible insulating tape
(also known as

An apparatus for use as a printer comprising:

a print carriage (30);
a print cartridge (24, 25, 26 or 27) having electrically
conductive interconnect pads (61) thereon;
a flexible insulating tape (87) attached to said carriage
(30), said tape (87) having a first surface and having

electrically conductive interconnect pads (85) in
said first surface and a series of bumps (110) on said

first surface and a series of dimples (111) on a
second surface opposite said first surface and facing

said carriage (30);
an elastomeric compensator (94) on said carriage (30), said
compensator (94) including a first side (115), a

second side opposite the first side (115), an
outwardly-facing series of columns (114) formed on

said first side (115), each having a hemispherical
distal end extending into respective ones of said

series of tape dimples (111); and
a gimbal structure (102, 106) in said carriage (30)
pivotably supporting said compensator (94) and urging

the distal end of said columns (114) into said tape
dimples (111).
An apparatus as in Claim 1, wherein the gimbal structure
(102, 106) further comprises:


a gimbal plate (102) having a first side and a second side
opposite the first side, the first side adjacent to

said tape (87); and
a spring (106) adjacent to the second side of the gimbal
plate (102).
An apparatus as in Claim 2, wherein the spring (106) is
pre-loaded to bias the gimbal plate (102) against the tape

(87) with a force of a desired magnitude. 
An apparatus as in Claim 2 or 3, wherein the spring (106)
supplies a substantially constant force for an expected

range of displacement of the tape (87).
An apparatus as in Claim 1, 2, 3, or 4, wherein the
columns (114) are each tapered such that a first magnitude

of a characteristic dimension of each column (114) measured
at and parallel to the first side (115) of the elastomeric

compensator (94) is greater than a second magnitude of the
characteristic dimension measured parallel to the first

side (115) of the elastomeric compensator (94) and at an
end of the column (114) distal from the first side (115) of

the elastomeric compensator (94).
An apparatus as in Claim 1 or 5, wherein:

each column (114) has a characteristic dimension
measured at and parallel to the first side (115) of the

elastomeric compensator (94); and
the ratio of the height of each column (114) to the
magnitude of the characteristic dimension is less than 1.

said print cartridge (24, 25, 26, or 27) and said print

carriage (30) in spite of an angular disposition between
said print cartridge (24, 25, 26, or 27) and said print
