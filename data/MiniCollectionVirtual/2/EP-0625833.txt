<ABSTRACT>
A radio communication apparatus comprises a 
transmitting circuit, a receiving circuit, an amplifier, a 

control circuit and a detecting circuit. The receiving 
circuit receives a signal from an opposite station such as a 

base station. The transmitting circuit transmits a signal 
to the opposite station. The amplifier amplifies the signal 

to be transmitted from the transmitting circuit. The 
control circuit controls the level of the transmission 

signal outputted from the amplifier. The detecting circuit 
detects the reception state in response to the reception 

level or the error rate of the signal transmitted from the 
opposite station. The control circuit selectively switches, 

in response to the detection signal obtained from the 
detecting circuit, the output level of the transmission 

signal obtained via the amplifier from a high-level mode to 
a low-level mode when the reception state of the signal 

transmitted from the opposite station satisfies a preset 
value.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a radio
communication apparatus and, more particularly, to an
apparatus where the output level of a transmission signal is
adjustable.In a duplex mobile telephone system inclusive of
portable telephone and car telephone, such as a cellular
phone system, a base station is capable of controlling or
designating the transmission output power of a mobile
station. The purpose is to reduce the transmission output
of the mobile station to the minimum value required for the
base station, so as to increase the number of mobile
stations, which can utilize the system, by using the same
channel even in a cell (service area) of another base
station.In the TAGS (Total Access Communication System),
the control or designation of the transmission output of a
mobile station is realized by transmission of a code termed
MAC (Mobile Attenuation Code) from the base station to the
mobile station. The relationship between the MAC and the
transmission output is shown in FIG. 1 of the accompanying
drawings. More specifically, the MAC is 3 bits of data, and
therefore it is possible to designate the transmission
output in a maximum of 8 steps. The transmission output is
classified into three classes from 1 to 3; i.e., class 1 is
assigned to car telephone or the like, class 2 to car
telephone and shoulder type mobile telephone, and class 3 to
handy type portable telephone, respectively.Accordingly, in a car telephone of class 1, its
transmission output is controlled or designated in 8 steps
at an interval of 4 dB. In a portable telephone of class 3,
its maximum output is predetermined to be less than half the
value of that of a car telephone in class 1 in order to 
increase the service life of the battery used as a power
supply.Further, although some errors are permitted
legally in the levels of such transmission outputs, the
allowable error range of each transmission output is set to
be relatively wide as shown in FIG. 1.A method of changing the transmission output in
accordance with the MAC will now be described below with
reference to FIG. 2. FIG. 2 is a block diagram of a radio
communication apparatus on which the present invention is
based.In FIG. 2, there are shown a mouthpiece 11, an
audio circuit 12, a transmitting circuit 13, a power
amplifier 14, a duplexer 15, a transmitting/receiving
antenna 16, a receiving circuit 17, and an earpiece 18.When a sound signal from the mouthpiece 11 is
supplied via the audio circuit 12 to the transmitting
circuit 13, it is converted into an up-channel
