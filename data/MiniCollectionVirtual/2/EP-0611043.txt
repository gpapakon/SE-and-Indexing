<ABSTRACT>
An electric rotary razor including at least one outer 
cutter (36) which has slits (37a) for whisker entry and at least one 

inner 
cutter (38) having a plurality of cutter blades (40). Each one of the 

cutting blades (40) is inclined in the rotational direction of the 
inner cutter (38) and has a cutting edge surface (41) at its upper end 

that 
slide on the bottom surface of the outer cutter (36). The cutting 

edge surface (41) is thinner than the cutter blade (40) or the cutter 
blade (40) 

can have a recess (40a) beneath the cutting edge surface (41). Thus, 
sheared whiskers are prevented from sticking to the cutter blade (40) 

of the inner cutter (38).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an electric razor 
and more particularly to an electric razor that includes an inner 
rotary cutter which can reduce the load and frictional resistance 
relative to the power source and outer cutter. In rotary electric razors, the inner cutters are 
rotated under the outer cutters, and the whiskers are cut by the 
shearing force provided by the outer and inner cutters. There is 
an electric razor having a single shaving unit that consists of a 
single inner cutter and a single outer cutter installed in a head 
frame of a razor. There is also another type of electric razor 
that has three shaving units arranged in an equilateral triangle 
shape on a head frame. Figure 8 illustrates the relationship between the 
outer cutter and the inner cutter. The explanation of the 
cutters will be made below referring to how the whiskers are cut 
by the cutters. More specifically, the outer cutter 2 has openings 
or slits 2a on the top surface. Whiskers penetrate the slits 2a 
into the razor and are cut by the sliding action of cutter blades  
 
4a (only one shown in this Figure) of the inner cutter 4 which is 
in contact with the outer cutter 2 and rotates in the direction 
of the arrow. In other words, the whiskers are cut by the outer 
cutter 2 and the rotating inner cutter 4. The cutter blades 4a 
of the inner cutter 4 are inclined in the rotational direction of 
the inner cutter. There are different types of inner cutters. One 
of them is an inner cutter obtained by cutting and bending a 
plurality of projections from the circumferential edge portion of 
a cutter disk that is made out of metal or other materials. When shaving is done, grease secreted out of the 
skin is mixed with shaving debris of the sheared whiskers. As a 
result, the shaving debris easily adheres to the surfaces of the 
cutter blade, particularly to the rear side surface 4b of the 
cutter blade 4a that faces the opposite direction from the 
direction of the rotation of the inner cutter. More 
specifically, if the shaving debris 5 and other substances adhere 
to the cutter blades, the frictional resistance between the inner 
cutter and outer cutter increases. This means that the load 
applied on the driving source (or motor) increases, resulting in 
high power consumption. Moreover, the rotational speed of the 
inner cutter goes down and the cutting or shaving performance 
drops. Thus, cleaning of the inner cutter 4 is inevitable. Furthermore, when the frictional resistance 
between the inner and outer cutters

<CLAIMS>
An inner cutter for an electric razor having at least one 
outer cutter (35) with openings through which, in use, whiskers 

penetrate the inner cutter comprising:- 

a plurality of cutter blades (40) extending from cutter arms (39a) integral with a round 
cutter disk (39), each one of said cutter arms with cutter blades having been 

obtained by cutting and bending a circumferential edge portion 
of said round cutter disk out of the plane of said cutter disk and being provided with a cutting edge 

surface (41) at an upper end thereof distant from, and substantially 
parallel to, the plane of the cutting disk, the cutter blades being adapted to be urged 

into contact with said outer cutter so as to slide in use on an 
inside surface of said outer cutter, said cutter blades (40) 

being inclined in a direction of rotation of said inner cutter,
 
characterized in that:- 
a recess (40a) is formed immediately beneath said cutting 
edge surface so as to face in a direction opposite from said 

direction of rotation of said inner cutter whereby said cutting 
edge surface is made thinner than a thickness of said cutter 

blade (40). 
An inner cutter as claimed in claim 1 wherein said round 
cutter disk has a through hole at a center thereof. 
An electric razor comprising at least one outer cutter (35) 
with openings through which, in use, whiskers penetrate and at 

least one inner cutter in accordance with claim 1 or claim 2.
