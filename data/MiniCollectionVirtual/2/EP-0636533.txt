<ABSTRACT>
This invention relates to the controlling of the travel of a crawler vehicle and aims at resolving the issue of making a crawler 
vehicle travel on an ungraded land with the crawlers effectively gripping the road surface. According to the present invention, 

the loads imparted to crawlers (12FL, 12FR, 12RL, 12RR) are detected, and, on the basis of the results of this detection, the sum 

of the loads on a pair of crawlers (12FL, 12RR) at the front left and rear right sides of a vehicle and the sum of the loads on a 
pair of crawlers (12FR, 12RL) at the front right and rear left sides thereof are computed. When a difference between the sums 

thus computed has become not lower than a predetermined level, it means that diagonal stack occurs. In such a case, the pivots 
(14) of a pair of crawlers having smaller loads are driven in a direction in which the loads imparted to the same crawlers increase, 

so that the floated pair of crawlers contact the road surface, these crawlers thus capable of providing an effective driving force. 
This invention is used mainly when a natural disaster rescue crawler vehicle travels on an outdoor ungraded land.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a traction 
controller for crawler vehicles, and more particularly to a 
traction controller for crawler vehicles for controlling 
the travel of a crawler vehicle of a four-wheel track frame 
structure used for natural disaster rescue purposes or the 
like on an ungraded land with the crawlers effectively 
gripping the road surface. When a so-called 4WD vehicle is made to 
sports-travel on an ungraded land where the road 
irregularities are large, there are cases where the load is 
concentrated on either pair of wheels of two pairs of 
wheels on two diagonal lines, and another pair of wheels 
idle and become stuck without being able to grip the road 
surface. This state is called a "diagonal stuck," and 
whether or not such a stuck state is brought about depends 
on the driving skill of the driver of the 4WD vehicle. In 
addition, once this diagonal stuck occurs, it is necessary 
to overcome the stuck state by such as using a winch, and 
much time and labor are required in overcoming it. In addition, a crawler vehicle has been 
conventionally known from Japanese Patent Publication No.  
 
270/1988, which has a 4-wheel track frame structure in 
which transverse pairs of crawlers are provided on the 
front and rear sides, respectively, of a vehicle body, and 
which travels as the driving of sprockets of the crawlers 
is controlled independently (hereafter, this crawler 
vehicle will be referred to as a "4-crawler vehicle). Since such a 4-crawler vehicle is similar to the 
above-described 4WD vehicle in that the "four wheels" are 
driven, the aforementioned diagonal stuck may also occur 
when the 4-crawler vehicle travels on an ungraded land 
where the road irregularities are large. However, the conventional 4-crawler vehicles are 
designed under the assumption that they are 
remote-controlled indoors and, even in the case of 
outdoors, on a flat land or on a road surface having small 
irregularities at most. Thus, there has been no design 
which assumes the occurrence of a diagonal stuck. Accordingly, in the case of 4-crawler vehicles as 
well, whether or not the diagonal stuck can be prevented in 
advance depends on the skill of the driver (operator) in 
the same way as with the 4WD vehicles. In addition, if the 
4-crawler vehicles are stuck, there is no other way than to 
overcome the stuck state by using a winch or the like. However, as compared with the 4WD vehicles used 
mainly for leisure, the 4-crawler vehicles are frequently 
used for a natural disaster rescue
