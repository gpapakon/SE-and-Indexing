<ABSTRACT>
A method and apparatus is provided for miniaturizing battery 
overtemperature protection and voltage regulation circuits in which such 

protection and regulation circuits are formed in an integrated circuit (200, 
600) and embedded in the casings of individual batteries. In one aspect of 

the invention, a MOSFET switch (Q1), a temperature sensitive diode (D1) 
and a control circuit (604) may be formed in an integrated circuit (600) and 

embedded in the casing of a battery. The MOSFET switch may be placed in 
the charging path of the battery to provide an open circuit when the battery 

temperature exceeds a predetermined value. In another aspect of the 
invention, the operation of the MOSFET switch (Q1) may be controlled by a 

control circuit (204) to provide a constant output voltage from the battery, 
thereby improving the operation of the portable system using the battery.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates generally to power sources for personal 
communications systems, and more particularly, to batteries with embedded 
overtemperature protection and/or voltage regulator circuitry. The rapid development of smaller, lighter and more efficient personal 
communication systems, such as personal computer notebooks, sub-notebooks, 
pocket cellular phones, miniature radios, stereos, and cassette 
players, has been fueled partly by the development of improved rechargeable 
batteries. For example, today's nickel cadmium batteries are more powerful 
than those in use just a few years ago. However, cadmium-based batteries 
are under increased scrutiny for both environmental and performance 
reasons. Consequently, the continuing demand for improved rechargeable-battery 
performance, combined with the need for a more environmentally 
acceptable battery, has driven the development of new rechargeable-battery 
technologies, such as, for example, nickel metal hydride batteries. Thus, the 
emerging generation of rechargeable batteries is not only intended to 
diminish the use of toxic heavy metals, but also to provide a significant 
improvement in energy density over existing cells. This improvement in 
energy density will allow designers of hand-held communications systems to 
significantly reduce the size of battery supplies and accordingly reduce the 
size of the hand-held systems. However, these reductions in battery size 
have not been accompanied by corresponding reductions in battery associated 
protection circuitry, which has hampered attempts to design smaller systems.  Essentially, the operating life of a rechargeable battery will be reduced 
if it's temperature rises significantly during the recharging process. In fact, a 
rechargeable battery can explode at the higher temperatures. Typically, 
portable communications systems contain protection circuits that monitor 
battery temperature during the charging process, and open the charging path 
if a specific temperature threshold is exceeded. A P-N junction diode, which 
has temperature dependent, forward conduction characteristics, is located in 
the general vicinity of the battery or power pack (e.g., multiple batteries). 
The protection circuitry is designed to monitor current flow through the 
temperature dependent diode and open the charge path at a predetermined 
temperature. Consequently, both the battery supply and the portable system 
may be protected from potentially serious damage. Nevertheless, these 
protection circuits take up
