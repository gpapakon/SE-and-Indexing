<ABSTRACT>
A process for simultaneously fabricating a flash-EEPROM 
memory and circuit transistors using the DPCC 

process wherein the first polysilicon layer is not 
removed from the circuit area (40a), and the gate 

regions of the circuit transistors are formed by 
shorting first and second polysilicon layers. The thin 

tunnel oxide layer (61) of the memory cells is formed 
using the same mask (36) provided for implanting boron 

(38) into the cell area (40b) of the substrate (38). 
Following implantation and without removing the mask, 

the gate oxide (35') formed previously over the whole 
surface of the wafer is removed from the cell area; the 

boron implant (38) mask is removed; and tunnel oxidation 
is performed so as to increase the thickness of the tunnel 

oxide (61) by the desired amount, and slightly 
increase the thickness of the oxide (gate oxide 35'') in 

the transistor area (40a).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a process for 
fabricating integrated devices including flash-EEPROM 
memories and transistors. Flash-EEPROM memories are Electrically Erasable 
Programmable Read Only Memories (EEPROMs) which combine 
the high density and low cost of EPROMs with the 
advantage of electrical erasability, and have recently 
become the most attractive of nonvolatile memories for 
their potential application in solid state disks for 
portable computers. Although different flash memory concepts have been 
developed, most flash manufacturers utilize the double-poly 
single-transistor cell which is very similar to a 
standard EPROM cell. Fig.s 1 and 2 show cross sections of EPROM and 
flash-EEPROM cells respectively. As shown in Fig.1, an EPROM cell, indicated as a 
whole by 1, is formed in a substrate 2, in this case a P 
type, housing N+ type source and drain regions 3 and 4  
 
separated by a channel region 5 formed by the substrate 
itself. Over substrate 2, at channel 5, two gate regions 
are provided: a floating gate region 6 completely 
embedded in an oxide layer 8, and a control gate region 
7. Gate region 6 is made of polycrystalline silicon; 
gate region 7 may be polysilicon or silicide 
(polysilicon and silicide); and the floating gate region 
is separated from the substrate by an oxide layer (gate 
oxide) 8a of a given thickness (typically 200 Å). As shown in Fig.2, a flash-EEPROM cell, indicated 
as a whole by 15, is very similar to the Fig.1 EPROM 
cell, and is formed in a P type substrate 16 housing 
source and drain regions 17 and 18 separated by channel 
19. In this case also, provision is made for a floating 
gate region 20 and a control gate region 21, both 
surrounded by an oxide layer 22. As compared with EPROM 
cell 1, however, the oxide layer 22a separating floating 
gate region 20 from substrate 16 and known as the tunnel 
oxide is much thinner, typically 100-130 Å. In the 
specific embodiment shown, source region 16 presents a 
graded junction with the substrate, and more 
specifically is formed in two parts: a heavily doped 
(N+) part 16a facing the larger surface 23 of the 
substrate, and a deeper, lightly doped (N-) part 16b 
surrounding part 16a on the sides not facing surface 23. The purpose of a graded junction is to enable the 
cell to better withstand the electrical stress to which 
it is subjected during erasing and programming, and may  
 
or may not be provided, depending on the operating 
conditions of the memory array. The thin tunnel oxide 
layer, on the
