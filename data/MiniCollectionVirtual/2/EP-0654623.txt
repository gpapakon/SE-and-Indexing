<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a hydraulic control
system of an automatic transmission.Generally, an automatic transmission for an automotive
vehicle is provided with a torque converter and a shift speed
mechanism. The torque converter converts a torque produced
by a crank shaft or an engine torque and transmits an engine
output torque to a turbine shaft as a turbine torque. The
shift speed mechanism mechanically converts the turbine
torque and introduces an output shaft. Meanwhile, the shift
speed mechanism is, generally, provided with a planetary gear
mechanism having a plurality of gears such as a sun gear,
ring gear, pinion gear and the like and employed to switch a
power transmitting path in its shift operation and thus
switches shift characteristics (shift stage, shift ratio).In order to change the power transmitting path or to
change the shift characteristics of the shift speed mechanism,
the automatic transmission is provided with a number of
hydraulic frictional elements, such as clutches for switching
on a gear (transmission of the torque) or off a
gear(interruption of the transmission of the torque ), brakes 
for braking on a gear (engage) or off (release) and the like.
The hydraulic mechanism switches the on-off pattern of the
respective frictional elements to thereby switch the shift
characteristics of the shift speed mechanism.In such an automatic transmission, an engaging force of
the frictional element is substantially proportional to a
line pressure or basic supply pressure. In a shift operation,
the engaging pressure of the frictional elements, in other
words, the line pressure of the hydraulic mechanism must have
an appropriate value in accordance with a torque amount
transmitted through the frictional element. If the unduly
high value of the line pressure incurs a power loss as well
as an undesirable shift shock. Conversely, the unduly low
line pressure extends a time period for the shift operation
resulting in a deterioration of the running performance of
the vehicle. The line pressure must have an appropriate value
at a normal condition other than the shift condition as well
in accordance with the torque amount transmitted through the
shift speed mechanism. As mentioned above, if the line pressure
is too high, the power loss is increased. And, if the
line pressure is too low, the frictional element produces a
slip therebetween so that an engaging portion of the frictional
element is undesirably worn and heated. Document EP 0 350 018 discloses a line pressure control arrangement
