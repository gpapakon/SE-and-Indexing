<ABSTRACT>
In a stove having a pyrolytic self-cleaning provision, the muffle of which stove can be operated by a heating element, arranged in at least one wall region, and optionally with additional circulating-air heating, the muffle being able to be ventilated by a circulating-air fan and being equipped with means for pyrolytic self-cleaning, and a gas sensor connected to an evaluation unit being arranged in the outgoing-air path of the muffle, the evaluation unit suggests a pyrolytic self-cleaning process to the user when a sensor-monitored, defined degree of soiling exists, when a baking oven starting temperature corresponds to a temperature-time profile which can be scanned in the evaluation unit.

Oven with pyrolytic self-cleaning, the oven chamber of which is operable by a
heating element, which is arranged in at least one wall region, and optionally with

additional circulating air heating, wherein the oven chamber can be loaded with air by an
air circulation blower and is equipped with means for pyrolytic self-cleaning and a gas

sensor connected with an evaluating unit is arranged in the exhaust air path of the oven
chamber, characterised in that the evaluating unit proposes a pyrolytic self-cleaning

process to the user when a sensor-monitored, defined degree of contamination is present
and when an oven cooking process is concluded and when the oven start temperature lies

in a profile, which can be interrogated in the evaluating unit, of oven start temperature and
heating-up time, wherein the oven start temperature is the start temperature for the

pyrolytic self-cleaning process and the heating-up time is the time during which the oven is

brought to a self-cleaning temperature, and wherein the evaluating unit terminates the
pyrolytic self-cleaning process after a holding time of up to about 80 minutes for the

pyrolytic self-cleaning process.
Oven with pyrolytic self-cleaning according to claim 1, characterised in that the
oven minimum start temperature amounts to 130°C.
Oven with pyrolytic self-cleaning according to claim 1, characterised in that the
evaluating unit corrects the heating-up time in dependence on the actual mains voltage for

the oven start temperature as parameter.
Oven with pyrolytic self-cleaning according to claim 1, characterised in that the
holding time begins with attainment of a pyrolysing target value temperature, which

depends on the analysis of degree of contamination.
Oven with pyrolytic self-cleaning according to claim 1, 4, characterised in that the
evaluating unit permits 480°C as maximum pyrolysing target value temperature.
Oven with pyrolytic self-cleaning according to claim 1, characterised in that the
evaluating unit interrupts a pyrolytic self-cleaning process, which is commanded by the

user, at the latest after 20 minutes.
