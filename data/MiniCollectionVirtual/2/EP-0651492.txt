<ABSTRACT>
A power supply system particularly for linear 
actuators for beds or couches with variable-angle headboard 

and/or footboard, which comprises a transformer (3) 
suitable to convert the electric power supplied by a mains 

power supply (2) into voltage and current values that are 
suitable to drive at least one electric motor (12) of a 

linear actuator. Means (8,9) for rectifying the voltage and 
the current are associated with the transformer (3). The 

particularity resides in the fact that the system comprises 
low heat-loss reactive means (4) that are interposed 

between the transformer (3) and the mains power supply (2) 
and can be cut in during the periods in which the at least 

one motor (12) is inactive, and bypass means (5,6) that are 
suitable to cut out the reactive means (4). The bypass 

means (5,6) are supplied by a low-voltage power supply (10) 
tapped from the transformer (3) during the inactive period 

of the motor.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a power supply system 
particularly for linear actuators for beds or couches with 
variable-angle headboard and/or footboard. As is known, there are beds or couches with variable-angle 
headboard and/or footboard. These kinds of bed or 
couch are provided with electric linear actuators that 
allow to adjust the headboard and/or footboard by means of 
the axes of the actuators, which are driven by electric 
motors. It is evident that the configuration assumed by beds 
or couches is adjusted in a few seconds and relatively 
infrequently. Accordingly, the inactive period of the 
motors of the linear actuators is considerably longer than 
their active period. During inactive periods the actuator power supply 
system is constantly connected to the mains, since it is 
rather awkward to disconnect the plug of the system from 
the power outlet when the bed or couch do not require 
adjustment. Since actuator motors are powered with a voltage that 
is relatively low with respect to the mains voltage 
(typically 24V), existing power supply systems require a 
transformer which has the drawback that it still absorbs a 
significant amount of current even during the inactive 
periods of the linear actuators (and of their electric 
motors), leading to a waste of electric power. The transformer connected to the mains furthermore  
 
produces vibrations (at 50 Hz) that can cause discomfort to 
users. Recent scientific studies furthermore claim that the 
electromagnetic radiation emitted by the transformer can be 
harmful to the health of potential users. In order to obviate these problems there is a solution 
that uses a low-voltage battery which powers the coil of a 
relay located in the plug of the power supply system. When 
the bed or couch requires adjustment, the battery, by means 
of a switch, activates the relay, which connects the plug 
to the transformer, supplying it with the mains voltage. This solution is efficient but requires a dry battery 
(typically of the 9 volt type) which discharges in the 
course of time and can be difficult to replace, since power 
supply systems are usually located below the couch/bed due 
to obvious aesthetic and functional reasons. This solution furthermore requires four wires for the 
plug: two for the mains power supply and two for supplying 
the relay coil. Accordingly, any replacement of the plug 
becomes a difficult task for the user and often requires 
the intervention of specialized technicians. Furthermore, the use of four wires and of a
