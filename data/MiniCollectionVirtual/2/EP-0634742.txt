<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an optical
head and a photodetector used in an optical head. More
specifically, the present invention relates to an
optical head used in an optical information apparatus
in which data is recorded, reproduced, and erased by
using an optical beam such as a laser, and a photodetector
used in such an optical head.An optical head, which is an important
element of an optical information apparatus, is a
device including means for focusing light on an optical
information storage medium and a means for detecting
light reflected from the optical information storage
medium. Figure 1 schematically shows a top face (a
light detection face) of a photodetector used in a
conventional optical head.The photodetector 16, as shown in Figure 1,
has a plurality of light receiving regions for signal
detection on a substrate and a plurality of terminals
on the edge of the substrate. The substrate is made of
a semiconductor, and the light receiving regions for
signal detection are PN-type or PIN-type photodiodes
formed in the semiconductor substrate. The predetermined
voltage is applied to the photodiodes in a reverse
direction. When the photodiodes are exposed to
light, a photocurrent flows across the PN junctions of
the photodiodes depending on the amount of the received
light. The detection of the amount of the photocurrent 
makes it possible to obtain the amount of the received
light. In order to operate the photodetector 16, it is
necessary to supply a predetermined potential
(voltage), for example, power level potential, reference
level potential, ground level potential, and the
like to each part of the semiconductor substrate. The
power level voltage is supplied to cathode common
terminals 17P1 and 17P2 to operate the photodetector 16
shown in Figure 1.In an optical head adopting a three-beam
method, one of the beams emitted from a light source
is diffracted by a diffraction element. Among the diffracted
light beams formed by the diffraction element,
a zero-order diffracted light beam is used as a main
beam, and first-order and minus-first-order diffracted
light beams are used as sub-beams for tracking. Among
the three light beams formed in the optical head, the
main beam forms an optical spot 18 in the middle of
signal detection regions 16A, 16B, 16C, and 16D (four
divided light receiving regions) of the photodetector
16, after the main beam is reflected by an optical
disk. A focus error signal can be obtained from a
differential signal between output signals of the
diagonal regions of
