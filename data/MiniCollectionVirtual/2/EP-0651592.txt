<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a circuit arrangement for igniting and operating a 
discharge lamp (La), provided with 


input terminals (K1,K2) for connection to a DC voltage source, 
a commutator (COM) coupled to the input terminals and provided with 
terminals (K3,K4) for connecting the discharge lamp (La), for commutating a 

current through the discharge lamp (La), 
a branch A which is conducting in both directions at least for alternating 
current, of which branch a first end is connected to an input terminal (K2) and 

a further end is connected to the commutator (COM), and which branch 
comprises an inductive element L shunted by a branch B which comprises a 

unidirectional element (D), 
a branch C which connects a further input terminal to the commutator (COM), 
and 
an ignition circuit (S) for igniting the discharge lamp. 
According to the invention, the unidirectional element (D)is so included in 
the branch B that the branch B conducts a current at least immediately after ignition of 

the discharge lamp (La). It is achieved thereby that a lamp operated by means of the 
circuit arrangement has good take-over properties.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a circuit arrangement for igniting and operating a
discharge lamp, provided with
input terminals for connection to a DC voltage source,a commutator coupled to the input terminals and provided with terminals for
connecting the discharge lamp, for commutating a current through the discharge
lamp,a branch A which is conducting in both directions at least for alternating
current, of which branch a first end is connected to an input terminal and a
further end is connected to the commutator, and which branch comprises an
inductive element L shunted by a branch B which comprises a unidirectional
element,a branch C which connects a further input terminal to the commutator, andan ignition circuit for igniting the discharge lamp.Such a circuit arrangement is known from published Netherlands Patent
Application 8901224. The circuit arrangement described therein is particularly suitable
for operating a high-pressure discharge lamp, referred to as lamp hereinafter. The
current through the lamp is low-frequency commutated during stationary lamp
operation. The lamp as a result has a luminous efficacy which is substantially equal to
the luminous efficacy obtained when the lamp is operated with a direct current, while
overheating of the electrodes in the lamp is avoided. The inductive element L serves as
a short-circuit protection: if there is a short-circuit in the commutator, the inductive
element L limits the current supplied by the DC voltage source. The unidirectional
element in branch B renders it possible for electromagnetic energy stored in the
inductive element L during a short-circuit to be dissipated in branch B. A disadvantage
of the known circuit arrangement is that the current flowing from the DC voltage source
through the lamp immediately after lamp ignition is comparatively weak. This
comparatively weak current is a result of the fact that the unidirectional element is so
connected that it cannot conduct part of the lamp current. The full lamp current flows 
through the inductive element, so that the speed with which the lamp current rises
immediately after lamp ignition is limited. This limited current through the lamp
immediately after lamp ignition causes a bad take-over, or possibly even lamp
extinction. Take-over is here understood to mean the phase in lamp operation between
lamp ignition and the moment a stable discharge between the electrodes is achieved.The invention has for its object inter alia to provide a circuit arrangement
which achieves a good take-over of the lamp
