<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a closing member which is designed as a truncated circular cone and, after dipping into a building adhesive, can be introduced into the conical opening which remains, during the production of a concrete wall or concrete floor, after the removal of the anchor cone of a bracing fitting belonging to the shuttering system. In order to permit the closing member to be pressed in easily and to permit the conical opening to be closed in a sealing manner, there is pushed, onto the tapered cone end of the closing member, a bracing and guiding ring (5) which is resilient in the radial direction and is profiled in such a manner that it forms a tangent to the cone end only at individual sections (6), and that its cone end of maximum diameter exhibits at least three guiding protuberances (8) which are distributed over its circumference and run in the axial direction of the cone.
