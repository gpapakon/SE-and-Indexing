<ABSTRACT>
A seal is installed at a leakage point (2) on a pipe (1) and a coaxial sleeve (3). The seal assembly incorporate a ring (7) located on the side away from the leakage point and has a second ring (7a) aligned to it. These rings are connected together via a circuit retaining element (5,9), deformable in its elastic region. The retaining element covers at least the inner surface of the original ring and the outer surface of the second ring. The two rings aligned to one retaining element expand radially in opposing directions.

Seal between a pipe (1) having a leakage point 
(2) and a sleeve (3) arranged coaxially relative to the 

pipe, with the use of two rings (7, 7a) consisting of a 
form memory alloy, which receive a leakage point between 

them and which, after being heated to a predeterminable 
temperature, strive to attain their original form by 

expansion in the radial direction, characterized in that 
each ring (7), on its side facing away from the leakage 

point, has arranged next to it a further ring (7a) 
consisting of a form memory alloy, in that the rings (7, 

7a) of each pair of rings then formed are connected to 
one another by means of an annular holding element (5, 9) 

which is deformable in the elastic range, in that, in the 
case of the first ring (7) of the pair of rings, at least 

its inner circumferential surface is overlapped by the 
holding element (5, 9) and, in the case of the other ring 

(7a) of the pair of rings, at least its outer circumferential 
surface is overlapped by the holding element (5, 

9), and in that the two rings (7, 7a) assigned to a 
holding element (5, 9) are rings which expand radially in 

opposite directions. 
Seal according to Claim 1, characterized in that 
the annular holding element (5) has, at each end, a 

recess (6) for receiving a ring (7, 7a), the position of 
the respective ring relative to the holding element being 

capable of being fixed. 
Seal according to Claim 1, characterized in that 
the annular holding element (9, 9a) is of step-like 

design, and in that the outer surface of the step (10) 
provided at one end of the holding element overlaps the  

 
inner circumferential surface of one ring (7) and the 

outer surface of the step (11) provided at the other end 
of the holding element overlaps the outer circumferential 

surface of the other ring (7a), the position of the 
respective ring relative to the holding element being 

capable of being fixed. 
Seal according to Claim 3, characterized in that 
the outer surface, associated with the respective ring 

(7, 7a), of the holding element (9, 9a) is designed 
conically, whilst the ring (7, 7a) preserves its cylindrical 

shape. 
Seal according to Claim 3, characterized in that 
a conical connection is made between the ring (7, 7a) and 

the associated outer surface of the holding element (9, 
9a). 
Seal according to Claim 2 or 3, characterized in 
that the gap width between the holding element (5, 9, 9a) 

and the pipe (1) or sleeve (3) is a maximum of 0.1 mm. 
Method for producing the seal according to Claim 
1, characterized in that the holding elements (5, 9, 9a) 

equipped with the rings (7, 7a) are retained on the 
sleeve (2) in the desired position, in that the sleeve 

(3) is brought into its installation position, and in 
that the rings (7, 7a) are heated to the predeterminable 

temperature, a part region of the holding element (5, 9, 
9a) being pressed onto the pipe (1) and a part of the 

holding element (5, 9, 9a) being pressed onto the sleeve 
(3).
