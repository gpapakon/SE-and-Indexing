<ABSTRACT>
The material according to the invention is obtained by detonation of an explosive substance having a negative oxygen balance, in a closed volume and in an inert atmosphere with respect to carbon, with a rate of cooling of the detonation products of 200 and 6000 degrees/minute and it contains, in % by weight:     - cubic-variety carbon                    30 to 75%   - carbon phase amorphous to X-rays        10 to 15%   - crystalline-variety carbon: remainder to 100%;  the proportions of the elements, in % by weight, are the following:     - carbon                              84 to 89%   - hydrogen                            0.3 to 1.1%   - nitrogen                            3.1 to 4.3%   - oxygen                              2.0 to 7.1%   - incombustible impurities            2.0 to 5.0% and the surface contains methyl, carboxyl, quinone, lactone, ether and aldehyde functional groups.
