<ABSTRACT>
Curable binders based on epoxy resin mixtures containing, as resin components, a mixture of epoxy resin containing at least two epoxide groups in the molecule and partial esters of a di- or polyepoxide compound with an ethylenically unsaturated acid in a weight ratio of from 90:10 to 10:90 and, as curing agent, an aminic compound containing at least one primary amino group in the molecule.

<CLAIMS>
Curable binders based on epoxy resin mixtures, characterized in that they contain a
resin component in the form of a mixture of epoxy resin with at least two epoxy

groups in the molecule and partial esters of a di- or polyepoxyde compound with an
ethylenically unsaturated acid in a weight ratio of from 90 : 10 to 10 : 90 and a

curing agent in the form of an amine compound with at least one primary amino
group in the molecule, whereas the quantity of amine compound is used that one

amine hydrogen atom is present for each ethylenically unsaturated group and for
each epoxy group.
Binders according to claim 1, characterized in that the ethylenically unsaturated acid
is acrylic or methacrylic acid.
Binders according to claims 1 and 2, characterized in that they additionally contain
liquid mercapto terminated polymers.
Binders according to claims 1 and 2, characterized in that they additionally contain
reaction products from liquid mercapto terminated polymers with a di- or

polyacrylate or -methacrylate.
Use of the binders according to one of claims 1 to 4 as injection resins.
Use of the binders according to one of claims 1 to 4 as binders for sealants and
adhesi
ves for producing isolating glass panes.
Use of the binders according to one of claims 1 to 4 as binders for dowel and tie-rod
materials.
