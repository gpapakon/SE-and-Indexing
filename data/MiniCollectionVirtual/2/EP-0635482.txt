<ABSTRACT>
Polyfluoronitrobenzenes, preferably di- or trifluoronitrobenzenes, are prepared advantageously from the corresponding chloronitrobenzenes and an alkali metal fluoride by a chlorine/fluorine exchange reaction, by catalysing the reaction with a quaternary ammonium compound containing at least one alkoxypolyoxyalkyl radical.
