<ABSTRACT>
In the case of the method for automatically brewing coffee, a preset quantity of cold water corresponding essentially to a small portion of coffee is automatically provided in a precisely metered manner and this preset quantity of cold water is supplied in a precisely metered manner with a preset quantity of heat sufficient to heat it to a preset brewing temperature. The heated brewing water is then forced through a preset quantity of ground coffee. The device has a metering means (D) for taking up and delivering a preset volume of cold water, independently of the instantaneous pressure of the supplied water, which is connected to a heating means (E) which has a heating chamber (18) comprising an inlet and an outlet and closely thermally in step with a heat accumulator (13) with preset heat capacity, which is connected to a temperature-controlled heating device.

Method of making coffee in a coffee machine in small 
measured portions, whereby a preset quantity of water 

heated by means of a heating apparatus is pressed 
through a preset quantity of ground coffee, wherein a 

preset quantity of cold water corresponding 
substantially to one small portion of coffee is first 

automatically provided in a precisely dosed manner and 
supplied to the heating apparatus in a continuous 

operation, characterized in that the preset quantity 
of cold water is supplied with a preset quantity of 

heat, which is sufficient to heat said water quantity 
up to a preset coffee-making temperature, in a 

precisely dosed manner by means of a heat accumulator 
with a preset storage content, which is connected to 

the heating apparatus and through which the preset 
quantity of cold water is passed, the heating 

apparatus operating in a temperature-controlled manner 
such that, in stand-by operation, the heat accumulator 

is maintained at a preset temperature above the 
coffee-making temperature and, during supply of the 

preset quantity of cold water to the heat accumulator, 
the heating apparatus continuously supplies heat to 

the heat accumulator. 
Device for effecting the method according to claim 1, 
comprising a dosing device (D) for detecting and 

dispensing a preset volume of cold water independently 
of the instantaneous pressure of the supplied water, 

which device is connected to a heating device (E) 

comprising a heating chamber (18), which has an inlet 
(18a) and an outlet (18b) and is connected to a 

heating apparatus, characterized in that heating 
device (E) is in close thermal contact with a heat 

accumulator (13) of a preset heat capacity, which is  
 

connected to the temperature-controlled heating 
apparatus (24-22a), the heat accumulator comprising a 

metal block (13) made of aluminium or an aluminium 
alloy and having a preset mass, into which the heating 

chamber (18) is worked and which contains the heating 
elements (24) of the heating apparatus. 
Device according to claim 2, characterized in that the 
metal block (13) has a mass of around 0.6 kg, the 

heating chamber (18) given a dosing quantity of around 
150 ml has a volume of around 15 ml and the 

temperature of the heat accumulator (13) in stand-by 
operation is around 115Â°C. 
Device according to claim 2 or 3, characterized in 
that the heating chamber (18) takes the form of a 

through-channel worked spirally, helically or in the 
shape of a meander into the metal block. 
Device according to one of claims 2 to 4, 
characterized in that the dosing device (D) is 

characterized by a first cylinder (1), the interior of 
which is closed at the one end by a cover plate (2) 

and in which a piston (3) is movably and sealingly 
guided, the front working surface (3a) of the piston 

directed towards the cover plate (2) having a shape 
adapted to the inside surface (2a) of the cover plate 

(2) while at the rear working surface (3b) of the 
piston (3) a second cylinder (4) is axially disposed, 

the outside diameter of which is a preset amount 
smaller than the inside diameter of the first cylinder 

(1) and which extends sealingly and movably through an 
annular plate (5) which delimits the interior of the 

first cylinder (1) at the other end, wherein a liquid 
supply line (6) is connected by a 3/2-way shutoff 

element (7) to the chamber acting as a dosing chamber 
(1a) between the front working surface (3a) of the  

 
piston (3) and the cover plate (2) and directly to the 

chamber acting as a resetting chamber (1b) between the 
two cylinders (1, 4) and a liquid discharge line (8) 

is connected by the 3/2-way shutoff element (7) to the 
dosing chamber (1a) and the 3/2-way shutoff element 

(7) is so designed that, in one position, it connects 
the liquid supply line (6) and, in the other position, 

it connects the liquid discharge line (8) to the 
dosing chamber (1a). 
Device according to claim 5, characterized in that the 
second cylinder (4) is mounted firmly on a base plate 

(9), on which the 3/2-way shutoff element (7) is 
disposed, and the first cylinder (1) is guided in an 

axially movable manner on the piston (3) and via the 
annular plate (5) on the second cylinder (4). 
Device according to claim 6, characterized in that the 
3/2-way shutoff element is a solenoid valve (7) which 

is disposed inside the second cylinder (4) on the base 
plate (9), wherein the liquid supply line (6) and the 

liquid discharge line (8) extend at least partially 
through the base plate (9) and the connection lines 

(10, 11) from the electromagnetic valve (7) to the 
resetting chamber (1b) and to the dosing chamber (1a) 

extend, at least in the portions (10a, 11a) adjoining 
said chambers, through the piston (3).
