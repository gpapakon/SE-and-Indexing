<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention refers to a new process for
the fractionation of deacylated glycerophospholipids of
formula (I)

wherein
Ris a negative charge, a hydrogen atom, a
CH2CH2NR1R2 residue (wherein R1 and R2, which are
the same or different, are H or C1-C4 alkyl), a
CH2CH2N+(CH3)3 residue, a CH2CH(NH2)COOH residue
or a residue of formula

andXis OH or O-,
starting from aqueous or hydroalcoholic mixtures,
having two or more components, of said deacylated
glycerophospholipids and of possible impurities of a
non-glycerophospholipidic kind.WO-A-9115494 discloses a process for separating,
purifying and fractioning deacylated phospholipids from
raw deacylated mixtures by first separating GPS in the
form of its insoluble salt followed by separation of
GPC and GPE by ion-exchange chromatography on a strong
cationic resin in the H form. This document mainly
concerns the separation of GPE from GPS.The process is characterized in that said mixtures
are subjected to electrodialysis in electrolytic cells
having a number of compartments, separated by cation-exchange
and/or anion-exchange membranes, in pH
conditions suited to differentiate, depending on the
positive, negative or neutral charge, the deacylated 
glycerophospholipids to be separated or other
impurities of a non-glycerophospholipidic kind.In the following description, the following
abbreviations will be used:
GPA for the compound of formula (I) wherein R = H;GPE for the compound of formula (I) wherein R =
CH2CH2NH2;GPC for the compound of formula (I) wherein R =
CH2CH2N+(CH3)3;GPS for the compound of formula (I) wherein R =
CH2CH(NH2)COOH;GPI for the compound of formula (I) wherein R is a
myoinositol residue.The compounds (I) may be of a fully synthetic
origin or they may be obtained by deacylation,
according to known methods, of acylated phospholipids
of vegetal origin (e.g. soy lecithin) or of animal
origin (e.g. egg yolk or bovine brain). In both
instances, in the mixture of compounds (I) to be
subjected to electrodialysis, impurities of a non-glycerophospholipidic
kind can be present, which may be
removed during the fractionation process or
subsequently according to conventional techniques, such
as crystallization, liquid/liquid extraction,
chromatography.The process surprisingly attains an effective
fractionation of the compounds (I) using, in comparison
with known methods, smaller amounts of chemical
reagents or solvents, giving smaller amounts of waste
to be disposed of, allowing to obtain compounds (I)
with higher productivity.  Compounds (I) are
