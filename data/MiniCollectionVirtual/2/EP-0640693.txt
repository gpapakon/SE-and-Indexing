<ABSTRACT>
Paper knives for the perforation cut in paper-processing machines are disposable knives and are manufactured from heat-treated steel. The service life of such knives, which come in various versions, is relatively short. According to the invention, the knife made from heat-treated steel is hardened by means of an electron beam or laser beam in that part of the blade or the teeth which is subject to wear to give a considerably greater hardness in this area. There is also a more finely distributed martensite in this area. According to the invention, the method is carried out in such a way that that part of the paper knife which is subject to wear is treated by a short-time hardening method involving self-quenching by subjecting it to an electron beam or laser beam.
