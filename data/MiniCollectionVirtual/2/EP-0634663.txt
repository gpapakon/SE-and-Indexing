<ABSTRACT>
A non-destructive testing equipment comprises a magnetic field 
generator for generating a uniform magnetic field, and a magnetic sensor 

accommodated in a thermal insulation container and filled with a liquid 
nitrogen. The thermal insulation container is located within a magnetic 

shield container having an opening. The magnetic sensor includes a 
SQUID that is a magnetic sensor having very high sensitivity. The 

magnetic sensor can detect, through the opening, an appreciable variation 
of the magnetic field that is caused by small impurities or minor defects 

contained in the object to be tested.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a non-destructive testing equipment,
ad more specifically, to a new portable magnetic testing equipment
which can detect impurities or defects contained in an object to be tested,
with high sensitivity.A slight defect in a body of aircraft or spacecrafts and satellites will
often result in a serious accident. Therefore, a periodical check and
maintenance are severely performed for the body of these vehicles.
However, since a so-called destructive testing cannot be performed for
these bodies, the checkings being currently performed are limited to a
checking by worker's eyes and an acoustic testing, so that a satisfactory
checking precision and reliability cannot be obtained, and working
efficiency of the checking operation is low.In addition, in laid power transmission cables and laid signal
transmission cables, it is possible to inspect a surface of these cables by
human's eyes, and to evaluate the condition of conductors included in
these cables on the basis of quality of transmission signals. However,
there has not yet been proposed a method capable of inspecting an internal 
condition of insulators included in the cables and of testing tensile strength
members themselves included in the cables. Similarly, it is very difficult
to inspect an internal condition of structural wire-cables after assembling.The document US-A-4 725 778 discloses a non-destructive testing
equipment comprising a current generator for generating a magnetic field
in an inspection zone by injecting a current in the object to be tested and a
magnetic sensor for detecting the magnetic field in the inspection zone. As mentioned above, in various technical fields, there is a large
demand for a method or equipment for precisely detecting extremely
small impurities or slight defects included in the materials having an
extremely large length or a large area. However, such a method or
equipment have not yet been proposed.It is a object of the present invention to provide a non-destructive
testing equipment which has overcome the above mentioned defect of the
conventional ones.Another object of the present invention is to provide a non-destructive
testing equipment which can precisely and efficiently inspect a
large scaled member or structure.Still another object of the present invention is to provide a non-destructive
testing equipment which can efficiently inspect an object to be
tested, such as a laid signal transmission cable, a laid power transmission
cable, or an assembled structural member, all of
