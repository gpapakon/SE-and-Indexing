<ABSTRACT>
A process for reforming gasoline boiling range naphtha stream using a reforming process unit comprised of two independent process units, each of which are operated in two stages. The first stage is operated in a fixed-bed mode and is comprised of a plurality of serially connected fixed bed reactors (R1a to R3a and R1b to R3b), and the second stage is operated in moving bed reactors (4a and 4b) in a moving bed continuous catalyst regeneration mode. A hydrogen-rich stream is separated in separation zones (S1 and S2) and is recycled through both stages for each process unit and the moving reforming zones share a common regeneration zone (CR).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a process for reforming a
gasoline boiling range naphtha stream using a reforming process unit
comprised of two independent process units, each of which are operated in
two stages. The first stage is operated in a fixed-bed mode and is
comprised of a plurality of serially connected fixed bed reactors, and the
second stage is operated in a moving bed continuous catalyst regeneration
mode. A hydrogen-rich stream is recycled through both stages for each
process unit and the moving-bed reforming zones share a common regeneration
zone.Catalytic reforming is a well established refinery process for
improving the octane quality of naphthas or straight run gasolines.
Reforming can be defined as the total effect of the molecular changes, or
hydrocarbon reactions, produced by dehydrogenation of cyclohexanes,
dehydroisomerization of alkylcyclopentanes, and dehydrocyclization of
paraffins and olefins to yield aromatics; isomerization of substituted
aromatics; and hydrocracking of paraffins which produces gas, and
inevitably coke, the latter being deposited on the catalyst. In catalytic
reforming, a multifunctional catalyst is usually employed wnich contains
a metal hydrogenation-dehydrogenation (hydrogen transfer) component, or
components, usually platinum, substantially atomically dispersed on the
surface of a porous, inorganic oxide support, such as alumina. The
support, which usually contains a halide, particularly chloride, provides
the acid functionality needed for isomerization, cyclization, and
hydrocracking reactions.Reforming reactions are both endothermic and exothermic, the
former being predominant, particularly in the early stages of reforming
with the latter being predominant in the latter stages. In view thereof,
it has become the practice to employ a reforming unit comprised of a
plurality of serially connected reactors with provision for heating the 
reaction stream as it passes from one reactor to another. There are three
major types of reforming: semi-regenerative, cyclic, and continuous.
Fixed-bed reactors are usually employed in semi-regenerative and cyclic
reforming, and moving-bed reactors in continuous reforming. In semi-regenerative
reforming, the entire reforming process unit is operated by
gradually and progressively increasing the temperature to compensate for
deactivation of the catalyst caused by coke deposition, until finally the
entire unit is shut-down for regeneration and reactivation of the catalyst.
In cyclic reforming, the reactors are individually

A process for catalytically reforming two gasoline boiling range
hydrocarbon reactant streams in the presence of hydrogen in a reforming process unit

comprised of two banks of reforming zones wherein each of the reforming zones
contains a reforming catalyst comprised of at least one Group VIII noble metal on a

refractory support, which process comprises:

(a) reforming the reactant streams, each in a separate first reforming
stage comprised of one or more serially connected reforming zones containing a fixed-bed

of a catalyst comprised of one or more Group VIII noble metals on a refractory
support, which one or more reforming zones are operated at reforming conditions

which includes a gauge pressure of from 100 to 500 psig (6.89 to 34.48 bar), thereby producing a first effluent
stream;
(b) passing each first effluent stream to a second reforming stage
comprised of a reforming zone which is operated in a moving-bed continuous catalyst

regeneration mode wherein the catalyst continually descends through each reforming
zone, exits, and is passed to a common regeneration zone wherein accumulated

carbon is burned off, and wherein regenerated catalyst is simultaneously recycled to
each of the moving-bed reforming zones;
(c) passing the effluent streams from each moving-bed reforming zone of
said second stage reforming to a separate separation zone wherein a hydrogen-rich

gaseous stream is separated and recycled to the lead reforming zone of each first
reforming stage; and
(d) collecting the remaining liquid reformate streams.
The process of claim 1 wherein the Group VIII noble metal is
platinum. 
The process of claim 1 or claim 2 wherein the catalyst in one or both
stages comprises one or more promoter metal components.
The process of any one of claims 1 to 3 wherein the catalyst in each
of the reforming zones of the first stage is comprised of from 0.01 to 5 wt.%

platinum, and from 0.01 to 5 wt.% of at least one metal selected from the group
consisting of iridium, rhenium, and tin.
The process of claim 4 wherein the catalyst in each of the first stage
reforming zones is comprised of from 0.1 to 2 wt.% platinum, and from 0.1 to 3 wt.%

iridium, rhenium and tin, preferably tin, on substantially spherical particles of a

refractory support.
The process of claim 6 wherein the amount of platinum and tin are
each from 0.1 to 2 wt.% and the substantially spherical refractory support

particles are comprised of alumina.

reforming stage contains 2 or 3 fixed-bed reforming zones for each fixed-bed process

unit, and (ii) the second reforming stage contains one or two moving-bed reforming
zones, with the proviso that when two moving-bed reforming zones are employed, the

catalyst descends through a first moving-bed reforming zone, is passed to the second
moving-bed reforming zone where it descends through said second moving-bed

reforming zone, then is passed to a regeneration zone where any accumulated carbon

reforming zone. 
The process of any one of claims 1 to 8 wherein reformate products
