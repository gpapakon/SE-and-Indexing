<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a load indicating 
fastener which is adapted to indicate loads to which it 
is subjected in use. It is desirable that applied fasteners should be 
properly tightened to designed load levels in order to 
ensure that secure joints are achieved by the use of 
the fasteners. Torque wrenches are commonly used for 
tightening fasteners such as bolts to pre-determined 
loads. They measure applied effort and are subject to 
friction so that the fastener loads they produce may 
not be as accurate as they might be. Fasteners have 
been proposed which indicate when desired loads have 
been applied to items but such fasteners have tended to 
be expensive and/or complicated to install. One form of load indicating fastener is known from 
French Patent No. 1 477 006 in which a graduated wire 
or strip is fixed at one end in an internal bore of a 
stud. Elongation of the stud under tensile stress is 
measurable against the fixed scale of the strip to 
provide an indication of applied load. In this 
arrangement it is difficult to accurately read the 
small elongation against the scale. Another form of fastener is disclosed in UK Patent 
Application GB 2 212 284 in which a stem fixed at one 
end to the shank of a bolt carries an electrical 
contact at its other end. Extension of the shank under 
an applied load draws the electrical contact towards an 
axially facing surface of the bolt. The variation in 
capacitance between the electrical contact and the 
surface may be used to provide an indication of the 
bolts extension and, hence, the applied load. 
Alternatively, completion of an electrical circuit  
 
between the electrical contact and the surface may 
indicate that a predetermined load has been applied. 
This system has been found to be complicated and 
expensive to implement with the required degree of 
accuracy. In addition, it does not provide a visual 
indication of applied load. The present invention aims to provide a load 
indicating fastener which indicates applied loads 
effectively and may be manufactured at reasonable cost. According to the present invention a load 
indicating fastener is provided which comprises a body 
having an abutment which is moved by the changing 
length of the body under an applied load, and load 
sensing means comprising an element disposed in the 
direction in which a load is applied to the body when 
the fastener is in use characterised in that the 
element is of elongated U-shape, a first limb of the U 
providing an anchorage part which is rigidly
