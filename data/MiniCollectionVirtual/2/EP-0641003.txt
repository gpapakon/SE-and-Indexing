<ABSTRACT>
An electromagnetic relay includes an electromagnet (14) with a pivoting blade (38), a mechanism (16) with a bell crank (44) intended to drive a bistable rocker contact (20), and an elastic device (56) for returning the blade (38) to a spaced-away position when the coil of the electromagnet (14) is not excited. A link rod (48) is articulated onto the blade (38) and the bell crank (44), and the return device includes a pair of compression springs (58, 60), one of which acts later than the other. A contact position indicator (72) is incorporated within a manual-control test button (70), and comprises an optical prism (78) interacting with a feeler (80) integral with the blade (38).

An electromagnetic relay housed in an insulating case (12) containing :

an electromagnet (14) with pivoting ferromagnetic blade (38),
an operating mechanism (16) with a rocker (44) mounted with rocking on a spindle
(46) between two extreme angular positions,
an operating component securedly united to the blade (38) and cooperating with the
rocker (44) to move the latter from one position to the other at each operating cycle of

the blade (38),
an electrical power circuit (18) having a bistable rocking contact (20) driven by the
rocker (44) and cooperating with at least one stationary contact (22, 24),
and a flexible device (56) for retuming the blade (38) to the separated position in the
rest state of the electromagnet (14).

characterized in that

the operating component comprises a connecting rod (48) articulated on the blade
(38) and rocker (44) to form a permanent direct connection, the articulation point (50)

of the connecting rod (48) on the rocker (44) being offset with respect to the rocking
spindle (46).
The electromagnetic relay according to claim 1, characterized in that the flexible
retum device (56) comprises a pair of compression springs (58, 60) acting

successively on the lower face of the blade (38), and extending parallel to one
another and to the connecting rod (48) in a direction appreciably perpendicular to the

blade (38).
The electromagnetic relay according to claim 1 or 2, characterized in that the front
face of the case (12) comprises an orifice (74) for passage of a manually operated 

test button (70) of the rocker (44), and that a contact position indicator (72) is
integrated inside the test button (70).
The electromagnetic relay according to claim 3, characterized in that the indicator
(72) comprises an optic prism (78) cooperating with a sensor (80) securedly united to

the blade (38), the sensor having at least one indicating marker (82, 92) designed to
cooperate with the inclined face of the prism (78) depending on whether the blade

(38) is in the attracted or separated position.
The electromagnetic relay according to claim 3 or 4, characterized in that the
indicator (72) comprises two markers (82, 84) of different colourings, and that the

prism (78) is arranged to reflect the coloured beam of each marker (82, 84) in the
direction of the front face.
The electromagnetic relay according to claim 4 or 5, characterized in that a spring
(86) is arranged between the blade (38) and the front face of the case (12) to bias the

test button (70) to a raised position enabling reliable operation of the indicator (72).
The electromagnetic relay according to claim 2, characterized in that the shorter
first spring (58) located between the connecting rod (48) and the second spring (60)

has a greater hardness than that of said second spring.
