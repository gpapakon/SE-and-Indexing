<ABSTRACT>
A vehicle door (1), particularly a side door of a passenger car, comprises a door body (2) in which there is arranged at least one guide rail (3) which is connected at its one end to a mounting bracket (9) and is held in position on the door body (2). In order further to develop a vehicle door of this kind in such a manner that whilst keeping the construction simple large installation and manufacturing tolerances can be compensated for and even when the door lining has been fitted simple mounting of the guide rail (3) on the door body (2) is possible, it is provided that the mounting bracket (9) cooperates with an adjusting device (10) held on the door body (2) and that a fastening screw (22) can be fitted through an opening (35) arranged on an outer boundary surface (34) of the door body (2) in order to secure the guide rail (3).

A vehicle door, in particular a side door of a passenger car, with a door body (2) in which 
at least one upright guide rail (3) is arranged, the lower end of which cooperates with an 

adjusting device (10) actuable through an opening (35) provided in an outer boundary 
face (34) of the door body (2), wherein the adjusting device comprises a fastening bolt 

(22) cooperating with a nut (23), 
characterized in that
 the adjusting device (10) is 
essentially formed by a holding bracket (20) secured to the lower edge area (11) of the 

door body (2) and a fastening plate (21) which cooperates therewith and which on the 
one hand is guided displaceably in the longitudinal direction (
E-E
) on an underlying 
abutment face (24) of the holding bracket (20) orientated at a right angle to the guide rail 

(3) and on the other hand receives - in a non-rotatable manner - a foot portion (15) of a 
fastening angled portion (9) connected to the guide rail (3), wherein the foot portion (15) 

is displaceable in the transverse direction (
D-D
) relative to the fastening plate (21), and 
the fastening bolt (22) is guided through the opening (35) provided in the underside (34) 

of the door body (2) and recesses (28, 29) in the holding bracket (20) and the fastening 
plate (21) in order to fasten the guide rail (3) in the desired position from below and is 

screwed into the nut (23) provided on the foot portion (15). 
A vehicle door according to Claim 1, 
characterized in that
 two spaced guiding webs 
(26), extending in the longitudinal direction and directed downwards, are provided on the 

fastening plate (21), the said guiding webs (26) cooperating with lateral edge portions 
(27) of the abutment face (24) of the holding bracket (20) and fixing the fastening plate 

(21) in the transverse direction (
D-D
) of the door body (2). 
A vehicle door according to Claim 1, 
characterized in that
 two spaced flanges (25), 
extending in the transverse direction and projecting upwards, are provided on the fastening 

plate (21), the said flanges (25) embracing a foot portion (15) of the fastening angled 
portion (9) with positive locking in such a way that the fastening angled portion (9) is 

displaceable only in the transverse direction (
D-D
) of the door body (2), wherein the projecting 
flanges (25) form a safeguard to prevent the guide rail (3) from rotating. 
A vehicle door according to Claim 1, 
characterized in that
 a nut (23), into which the 
fastening bolt (22) can be screwed from below, is provided on the foot portion (15) of the 

fastening angled portion (9), wherein recesses (28, 29) in the holding bracket (20) and 
the fastening plate (21) are considerably larger than the external diameter 
d
 of the fastening  
 

bolt (22). 
A vehicle door according to Claim 1, 
characterized in that
 the holding bracket (20) 
comprises two wall portions (30, 31) extending upwards and connected to each other by 

the abutment face (24), wherein flanges (32, 33) projecting at the end of the wall portions 
(30, 31) rest against a lower, substantially horizontal rim area (11) of the door body (2) 

and are securely connected thereto. 
A vehicle door according to Claim 1, 
characterized in that
 the abutment face (24) is 
orientated substantially at a right angle to the longitudinal extension of the guide rail (3) 

and extends at a distance from the lower horizontal rim area (11) of the door body (2). 
A vehicle door according to Claims 1, 5 and 6, 
characterized in that
 the opening (35) 
provided in the door body (2) for inserting the fastening bolt (22) extends in t
he region of 
the holding bracket (20), namely in the space between the two spaced upright wall portions 

(30, 31) below the abutment face (24). 
A vehicle door according to Claims 1 and 7, 
characterized in that
 a removable closure 
stopper (37) is insertible into the opening (35) provided in the door body (2).
