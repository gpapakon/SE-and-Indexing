<ABSTRACT>
In a flat connector socket, there being provided a 
contact spring arm base having crimps, two contact 

spring arms disposed on the base, such arms being bent 
inwards towards one another over some of their length 

at a distance from the free ends and being bent back at 
such ends, and an overspring which is securable by way 

of an overspring base to the contact spring arm base, 
extends outwards by way of parts disposed on the 

overspring base, adjacent the contact spring arms 
therefrom, engages by way of parts bent towards one 

another at the free ends, over the free ends of the 
contact spring arms and supports the socket in a 

chamber of a socket envelope, in order to protect the 
contact spring arms and to facilitate undisturbed use 

thereof in pivoting systems, the overspring base (10) 
and the overspring part (11) which extends adjacent the 

contact spring arms (3) are embodied by a peripherally 
closed socket member which, by way of bent parts (12) 

disposed on first side walls (11') extending adjacent 
the wide sides of the contact spring arms (3), engages 

over the free ends thereof and is formed with notches 
(15) in second side walls (11'') between the first side 

walls (11') having bent parts (12), into which notches 
(15) the end-face end of the first side walls (11') 

merges and which extend over some of their length 
towards the contact spring arm base (2).

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a connector having an envelope
having a chamber, having further a flat connector socket,
provided with a contact spring arm base having crimps, and
two contact spring arms extending from the base, said arms
being bent inwards towards one another over some of their
length at a distance from the free ends and being bent back
at such ends, said socket being provided with an overspring,
supporting the socket in said chamber of said
socket envelope, said overspring having a base securable to
the contact spring arm base and parts extending adjacent
the contact spring arms, wherein said overspring has opposed
first side walls each with an end part which are bent
towards one another which extend over the free ends of the
contact spring arms respectively, said overspring base and
said overspring parts form a peripherally closed socket
member with help of opposed side walls provided with
notches, whereby the end-face end of the first side walls
merge into said second side walls and extend over some of
their length towards the contact spring arm base.In FR 2 627 020 there is described a contact socket
for receiving a flat contact element having a notch on one
side of a cage whereas the cage is forming the contact
socket. The socket includes two contact spring arms. The
opening degree of the two spring arms can be limited by
flaps that were cut free from the contact socket. There are
no grooves on lateral front sides of the contact. In known flat connector sockets of this kind the
overspring secured by way of its base to the contact spring
arm base has strip-like resilient arms which are associated
with the contact spring arms to provide additional force.
Due to the exposed construction of the contact spring arms
the known connector sockets although permitting the axial
insertion of contact pins and the use of the connector in
pivoting systems, have the disadvantage that the contact
spring arms, being unprotected, are open to disturbing mechanical
influences; also, the fixing of the socket in envelopes
is unsatisfactory.It is the object of the invention to provide a connector
of the kind hereinbefore set out that provides a
better fixing possibility in a chamber of an envelope.According to the invention, therefore, the base zones
of the notches serve as abutment for first projections protruding
from the walls of the envelope into said chamber,
and second projections are disposed resiliently on the envelope
and are engageable with the socket below the end of
the overspring base remote from

<CLAIMS>
A connector having:

an envelope (19) having a chamber (18),
having further a flat connector socket, provided with a
contact spring arm base (2) having crimps (5, 6), and

two contact spring arms (3) extending from the base
(2), said arms being bent inwards towards one another

over some of their length at a distance from the free
ends and being bent back at such ends,
said socket being provided with an overspring (9), supporting
the socket in said chamber of said socket envelope

(19), said overspring having a base (10) securable
to the contact spring arm base (2) and parts (11) extending

adjacent the contact spring arms, wherein said
overspring has opposed first side walls (11') each with

an end part (12) which are bent towards one another
which extend over the free ends of the contact spring

arms respectively,
said overspring base (10) and said overspring parts
(11) form a peripherally closed socket member with help

of opposed side walls (11") provided with notches (15),
whereby the end-face end of the first side walls (11')

merge into said second side walls (11") and extend over
some of their length towards the contact spring arm

base (2), and
characterized in that
the base zones of the notches (15) serve as abutment
for first projections (20) protruding from the walls of

the envelope (19) into said chamber (18), 
and that second projections (21) are disposed resiliently
on the envelope (19) and are engageable with

the socket below the end of the overspring base remote
from the notches (15).
