<ABSTRACT>
Dry-shaving apparatus comprises a drive provided in a housing (1) and at least two parallel shaving units (13, 14, 15), each having a respective outer cutter (16, 17, 20), an inner cutter (21, 22, 34) and at least one biasing element (31, 32, 33, 45). In order to improve contact with the face during use, the biasing element (31, 32) of one shaving unit (13, 14, 15) has a characteristic which differs from that of the biasing element (33) of a further shaving unit (13, 14, 15), which characteristic is such that under the effect of a force applied externaly to the shaving units (13, 14, 15), motion can be performed by said one of the shaving units (13, 14, 15) relative to the further shaving unit (13, 14, 15).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to dry-shaving apparatus comprising a
drive provided in a housing and at least two parallel shaving units each
consisting of a respective outer cutter, a respective inner cutter and at least
one biasing element against which the shaving unit is retractable.Such apparatus is described in GB-A-2 036 631 and US-A-4 292 737.
GB-A-2 036 631 discloses a dry shaver having two independent shaving
units surrounding by a removable shear head frame, each removable
separately from the shaver. Each unit has its own outer foil fastened to a
base plate, inner cutter and bias spring mounted on the base plate and
pressing inner cutter against foil. Moreover, each unit is coupled to the
shaver housing by spring-loaded retainers providing respective float springs
in the shaver body to enable independent floating movement of both units
relative to the shaver body. Neither shaving unit is constructed as a long
hair cutter.JP-A-54-29262 describes an electric shaver having a cutter head
constituted by a plurality of cutter units which may have a variety of
geometrical shapes, such as rectangles, sectors or circles. Each cutter unit
may be allowed to float against a bias spring. In order to improve the
shaving efficiency, the spring pressure of the various float springs may vary
according to the cutter unit.Other examples of dry shaving apparatus are known from US-A-4
797 997 and DE-C-3 926 894. In DE-C-3 926 894 each outer cutter is secured on a shaving head
frame arranged on the housing. The inner cutters are mounted on a
common coupling element which is connected to a drive element of an
electrical drive. Each inner cutter is pressed against the associated outer
cutter by means of a respective spring element. The two spring elements
each have an appropriate characteristic in order to ensure good engagement
of the inner cutter with the outer cutter. According to a further embodiment
the outer cutter is mounted on a removable frame coupled to the shaving
head frame, which is pivotably mounted on the housing of the dry-shaving
apparatus.A dry-shaving apparatus having four parallel shaving units is known
from US-A-3 589 005. The two outer shaving units, constructed as short hair
cutters, each consist of an outer cutter, an inner cutter and a spring element
arranged between a drive element and the inner cutter. Between the two
outer shaving units are provided two comb-like long hair cutters, each of
which consists of a toothed cutting comb and an associated toothed cutting
blade, particularly for
