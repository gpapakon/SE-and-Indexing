<ABSTRACT>
Known processorsystems comprising a processor and memory fields for 
containing computer interface profiles each having a number of elements each 

representing a function are static systems. The processorsystem according to 
the invention is a dynamic system, by allocating an elementparameter to an 

element, which elementparameter is a function of the number of times this 
element has been activated, for example per timeinterval, and by comparing 

this elementparameter with a predefined value. In dependence of the comparisonresult, 
the element is displayed directly or indirectly.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a processorsystem comprising a processor and a
memory field for containing a computer interface having a number of elements
each representing a function, the processorsystem being adapted for
displaying at least one element directly on a screen.Such processorsystems are of common general knowledge, for example
a Personal Computer (PC) or a workstation. The computer interface has a
number of elements each representing a function, for example an icon
(function: for example file transfer), a menubar (function: for example menu
item choise), a window (function: for example editing of text or sharing
computer application data), a videowindow (function: for example display of
image) or a number of required videowindows (function: for example required
number of images to be displayed simultaneously). The processorsystem is
adapted for displaying one or more elements directly on a screen, like four
icons, one menubar including menu-items and two videowindows, and for
displaying other elements indirectly on the screen, like two other icons and a
pull-down-menu-item (these can be displayed for example by selecting a
menu-item on the displayed menubar). Other elements are never displayed on
the screen, like the number of required videowindows.These known processorsystems are static systems, which is disadvantageous. It is an object of the invention, inter alia, to provide a dynamic processorsystem
as defined by the preamble.Thereto, the processorsystem according to the invention is characterised
in that the processorsystem is adapted for
allocating an elementparameter to an element, the elementparameter being a
function of a number of times that this element has been activated, andcomparing this elementparameter with a predefined value and in dependence
of a comparisonresult directly or indirectly displaying this element on the
screen,
the memory field being an adaptable memory field and the computer interface
being an adaptable computer interface.By allocating an elementparameter to an element, which elementparameter
is a function of a number of times that this element has been activated,
for example the number of times per timeinterval that this element has been
activated, this elementparameter can be compared with a predefined value. In
dependence of this comparisonresult the element is displayed directly or
indirectly. For example each time an application to which the computer
interface belongs is switched on, the processorsystem can decide at the hand
of several comparisonresults

<CLAIMS>
Processor system comprising a processor and a memory field for
containing a computer interface having a number of graphic elements each

representing a function, an element being directly displayed on a
screen in case this element is entirely displayed all the time and

independently of whether or not this element has been activated, and an
element being selectively displayable on the screen in case this

element is not entirely displayed all the time but is only entirely
displayed after this element has been activated, the processor system

being adapted for displaying at least one element directly on screen,

characterized in
 the processor system being adapted for
allocating a first element parameter to a first element, the first

element parameter being a function of a number of times this first
element has been activated,


allocating an element type to the first element,
allocating a second element parameter to a second element, the second
element parameter being a function of a number of times this second

element has been activated,
allocating an element type to the second element,
comparing the first element parameter with a threshold value and
based on a comparison result directly displaying the first

element on the screen or enabling the first element for selective
display on the screen,
comparing the second element parameter with another threshold value
and based on another comparison result directly displaying the

second element on the screen or enabling the second element for
selective display on the screen, and
based on the comparison results interchanging values of at
least two elements types,
the memory field and the computer interface being adaptable by
storing new values of element parameters and of element types.
Processor system according to claim 1 or claim 2, wherein,
in the memory field, storage

locations are represented by rows and columns, and elements are
located at rows and element parameters are located

at columns.
