<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a low-bed semitrailer (1) having a low-bed platform (4) which has a loading area (5) and is placed, such that it is lower, between a rear, multiaxle chassis (2) and a drawbar which is expediently designed as a semitrailer swan neck (3) or as a towbar. In this low-bed semitrailer (1) at least the first of the axles (6, 7, 8, 9) arranged towards the swan neck (3) is designed such that it is shorter than the remaining axles, which have the customary axle width, such that the wheels (10, 11) of this axle(s) are offset symmetrically towards the longitudinal centre axis (A) of the low-bed platform (4) and, as a result, have a narrower track, and that the loading area (5) is extended in a forked manner on both sides of the wheels (10, 11) of this (these) shortened axle(s) towards the rear (arrow D).

<CLAIMS>
Low bed semi-trailer (1) having a low bed bridge (4) which is 
positioned low between a rear multi-axle running gear (2) and a 

drawbar which purposely is formed as a gooseneck bracket or a 
forked drawbar, said low bed bridge (4) having a loading 

floor (5), 
characterized
 in that at least the first of those 
axles (6, 7, 8, 9) which are arranged towards the gooseneck (3) 

is shorter than the rest of the axles having usual axle width, 
such that the wheels (10, 11) of this axle (6) or these axles are 

offset symmetrically towards the longitudinal central axis (A) of 
the low bed bridge (4) and, therefore, show a narrower track than 

the wheels (15, 16) of the rest of the axles, and in that the 
loading floor is fork-shaped and is extended at both sides of the 

wheels (10, 11) of the said shortened axle(s) towards the rear 
(arrow D) into the region of the running gear. 
Low bed semi-trailer according to claim 1 with a rear four-axle 
running gear, 
characterized
 in that extensions (12, 13) of the 
loading floor (5) extend towards the rear practically up to one 

half of the running gear (2). 
Low bed semi-trailer according to claim 1 or 2 having a 
hydraulically actuated gooseneck bracket (3) for lowering the 

forward end of the low bed bridge (4) to the ground for removing 
the gooseneck and loading from the front, 
characterized
 in that 
the extensions (12, 13) of the loading floor (5) projecting  

 
beyond the shortened axle (6) or axles can be removed or folded 

upwardly for wheel exchange. 
Low bed semi-trailer according to claim 3, 
characterized
 in that 
the extensions (12, 13) are attached to the low bed bridge (4) by 

means of bolt couplings. 
Low bed semi-trailer according to claim 3, 
characterized
 in that 
the extensions (12, 13) can be folded upwardly by means of hinges 

at the low bed bridge (4).
