<ABSTRACT>
Radio-frequency surgical device for cutting and/or coagulating biological tissues by means of radio-frequency electric current, having an automatic regulation circuit for regulating the output voltage (Ua), a voltage transformer (6) combined with electrical isolation in the form of an isolating transformer (5) being connected to the output sockets (10, 11) for the application circuit (17) or points lying closer to the electrodes, the output signal (a=f(Ua)) of which voltage transformer is fed to a regulating amplifier (7) to which a setpoint signal (b) from a setpoint generator (8) is also fed, the output signal (c) of this regulating amplifier (7) being fed to the amplifier (2), in order to control the gain of the amplifier such that the output voltage (Ua) at the output sockets (10, 11) corresponds to the setpoint determined by the setpoint signal (b) (Figure 1). A surgical device having a regulating device for the RF output voltage is also described, the output sockets (10, 11) for the application circuit (17) or points in the application circuit (17) located behind these sockets being connected to a voltage transformer (6) combined with an electrical isolation (5), in order to generate a real-value signal (a=f(Ua)), signals corresponding to the setpoint signal (b) and to the real-value signal (a) being fed to an electronic display device (30), in order to display the set point and/or the real value.
