<ABSTRACT>
A device for automatically rewinding a film (F) of 
various sizes from its film cartridge (X) to a magazine for use 

with a developing machine. The film cartridge of the film 
to be rewound is supported on a support member (3) at the inlet 

side. The film is fed by the film feed device having feed 
rollers (4), film feed motor (5) and film guide (6). It is taken up on 

the take-up magazine (Y) supported on a support at the outlet 
side. The rear end of the film is cut off the film 

cartridge by a cutter (8).

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates an automatic film rewinder system comprising an automatic
film rewinder and a processing container, said automatic rewinder comprising: a
first support means for supporting a film cartridge accommodating a single film, a
cutter means for cutting the rear end of the film from the film cartridge, a second
support means for supporting said processing container, and a film feed device for
feeding the film from said film cartridge to said processing container comprising a
plurality of pairs of feed rollers, and a first photo detector being located between a
first and second pair of feed rollers.Since photographic films come in various sizes (110, 125, 135, etc.), they have
to be rewound into a special magazine for use with a developing machine
before developing them. Heretofore, such rewinding work has been carried out
by putting both a film cartridge accommodating a film and the magazine in a
black box, inserting both hands of an operator into the black box, and manually
rewinding the film into the magazine.Such rewinding work is extremely low in workability and efficiency partly
because such work has to be done manually and partly because the operator
cannot see the inside of the black box. Thus, it has been desired to automate
this rewinding work.An example of such an automatic film rewinder is presented by the Japanese
document JP5-119461. Said film rewinder, called a film splicing apparatus,
comprises a film delivering unit (60) where a film (56) which is delivered in a
film cartridge (14) is kept during the process of rewinding. From there the film
is taken by a film feed device (64) and directed along a detecting device and
then forwarded via further components of the film splicing apparatus towards
one of provided film magazines (54).Such a film splicing apparatus used by itself or in combination with a curl
removing apparatus as presented by the Japanese document JP5-011354 is
mainly designed for being used in large laboratories processing a great amount 
of films in a very short time. Therefore, this film splicing apparatus takes the
film from the original cartridge and combines its beginning to the end of a
previously rewound film, thus, producing take-up magazines holding more than
one single film for further processing of a certain amount of films at one time.
However, this film splicing apparatus requires a very complex structure and,
therefore, is extremely expensive to build and also needs a vast amount of films
to be processed every day in order for it to be cost

<CLAIMS>
An automatic film rewinder system comprising an automatic film rewinder and a
processing container, said automatic rewinder comprising:


a first support means (3) for supporting a film cartridge (X) accommodating a single
film (F),
a cutter means (8) for cutting the rear end of the film (F) from the film cartridge (X),
a second support means for supporting said processing container (Y), and
a film feed device for feeding the film (F) from said film cartridge (X) to said
processing container (Y) comprising a plurality of pairs of feed rollers (4), and
a first photo detector (PH1) being located between a first and second pair of feed
rollers (4),
characterized in that
 said processing container (Y) is designed to hold a
maximum of one film (F) and is usable for various types of film (F), and wherein

said film feed device further comprises

a curl remover (11) for removing any curling tendency of the film (F) while the film
(F) is being fed through said film feed device,

a magnetic head (10) for reading magnetic information recorded on the film (F) and
writing magnetic information onto the film (F) while the film (F) is being fed through

said film feed device, and

a magnetic device (9) for pressing together said first pair of feed rollers (4) as the
front end of said film is detected by said first photo detector (PH1), and

a film feed motor (5) for driving said feed rollers (4) via a belt (B). 
An automatic film rewinder according to claim 1, wherein said processing container
(Y) comprises two parts (Y
a
), one carrying a take up shaft for said film (F), the other
one serving as an openable light shielding cover which is automatically openable and

closeable.
An automatic film rewinder according to claim 1 or 2, wherein said processing
container (Y) further comprises a number of guiding devices (Y
d
) for guiding the film
(F) when inserted into the processing container. 
An automatic film rewinder as claimed in at least one of the previous claims 1 to 3
further comprising a take up means for taking up the film from the film feed device into

said processing container (Y), said take up means comprising a second photo detector
(PH2) for detecting the front and the end of the film (F), a take up shaft driving motor

(15) for driving said take up shaft (Y
c
) and a driving motor (16) for opening and closing
the light shielding cover (Y
a
).
An automatic film rewinder according to at least one of the previous claims 1 to 4,
wherein the belt (B) is a chain.
