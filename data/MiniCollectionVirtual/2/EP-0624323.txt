<ABSTRACT>
In a shoesole (5) on a rubber base, in particular for flexible shoes, the shoesole (5) covering both the front foot region (3) and the ankle and heel region (4) of the shoe, the ankle and heel region (4) of the shoesole (5) has a greater Shore hardness than the front foot region (3) of the shoesole. A sheet (6) for making shoesoles is vulcanised homogeneously from two rubber compounds of different Shore hardness in such a manner that the sheet (6) is divided in the direction of a longitudinal edge into alternately successive longitudinal sections (1, 2) of different shore hardness.

<CLAIMS>
Rubber-based shoe sole, in particular for flexible 
shoes, in which the shoe sole (5) covers both the front 

region (3) and the coupling and heel region (4) of the 
shoe, characterised in that the coupling and heel region 

(4) of the shoe sole (5) exhibits a higher Shore hardness 
than the front region (3) of the shoe sole (5). 
Shoe sole according to claim 1, characterised in 
that the difference in the Shore hardness levels is 5 to 

10°. 
Shoe sole according to claim 2, characterised in 
that the Shore hardness lies between 75 and 90° in the 

front region (3) and between 85 and 98° in the coupling 
and heel region (4).
