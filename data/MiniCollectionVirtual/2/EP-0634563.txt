<ABSTRACT>
In order to accommodate the increasing numbers of passengers and to meet the demand for greater comfort, the quantity of water available on board an aircraft must increase, which means that at least some of the water needed for the water supply must be produced on board an aircraft during the flight. In such a method the invention resides in the fact that the exhaust gases occurring in the engine in combustion of the fuel are drawn off at a suitable point downstream of a turbine stage and the exhaust gases drawn off are cooled to a temperature such that a substantial part of the water contained in the exhaust gas as a product of combustion condenses out, the water condensed out is separated from the cooled exhaust gases by suitable means, for example water separator, the separated water is collected and the water obtained is treated to a required water quality and the treated water, depending on the further use, is collected in a water tank or fed to existing water supply systems. In this way a reduction of the flying weight is achieved and the transport capacities usually needed for quantities of water can be reduced.
