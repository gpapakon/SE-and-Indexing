<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a method for insulation monitoring of unearthed electrical DC networks (mains) and AC networks having an unavoidable ohmic and capacitive insulation impedance between network and earth, in particular such networks with connected rectifiers or other current converters. This method includes a AC pulse voltage which has alternately different pulse voltage values and is applied as measurement voltage via an ohmic network coupling between network and earth to the network to be monitored. The measurement current flowing between network and earth for each pulse voltage value of the transient oscillation of the network at this pulse voltage value, which current is dependent on the magnitude of the insulation impedance between the network and earth and on the pulse voltage value, is detected directly or indirectly as measured-current measured-value, and the measurement-value difference between two sequential measured-current measured-values is used to determine the ohmic insulation impedance between network and earth. In this case it is proposed according to the invention, in order to reduce the measurement times, to observe for each pulse voltage value of the measurement voltage the time response of the instantaneous-network-dependent transient oscillation process of the measurement current, or a quantity such as a voltage derived therefrom, until reaching the transient oscillation state, and to detect the associated measured-current measured-values directly after reaching the transient oscillation states and to switch over the respective pulse voltage value of the AC pulse voltage immediately to its next pulse voltage value. The invention furthermore relates to a device suitable for carrying out this method, with an AC pulse voltage source (20) which generates a measurement pulse and can be connected via an ohmic measurement resistor (Rm; 22) and an ohmic network coupling (24) between an unearthed electrical network (12) to be monitored and earth (E), and further having an evaluation unit which is connected to the measurement resistor and detects the measured-current measured-value (Um1, Um2) occurring respectively at the end of the transient oscillation process of one of each of the measurement pulses at the measurement resistor and it determines the ohmic insulation impedance (Re) between the network to be monitored and earth from the measured-value difference (Um1-Um2) of two sequential measured-current measured-values respectively. In this case it is proposed, according to the invention, for the AC pulse voltage source to be designed as a switchable voltage source (20) which can in each case generate one of a plurality, in particular two, different DC voltage values as a function of a control signal (S; 36), and for the evaluation unit (28, 34) to be designed such that it detects the electrical transient oscillation process from a DC voltage value across the measurement resistor (Rm; 22) and switches the switchable voltage source to the other DC voltage value at the end of each transient oscillation process.

Method for insulation monitoring in unearthed electric dc
and ac networks which have an unavoidable ohmic and

capacitative insulation resistance between network and earth,
in particular those with connected rectifiers and other

converters, in which a pulsed alternating voltage which has
alternatingly different pulsed voltage values (U
p
) is applied
as measuring voltage to the network (10) to be monitored via

an ohmic network coupling (24) between network and earth,
wherein for each pulsed voltage value of the measuring voltage

the time characteristic of the instantaneous network-dependent
transient phenomenon of the measured current or a variable

derived therefrom, such as a voltage, is monitored until the
transient state is reached, and the measured current flowing

immediately after the transient condition of the network to
this pulsed voltage value between network and earth, which

measured current is dependent on the value of the ohmic
insulation resistance of the network with respect to earth and

on the pulsed voltage value, is detected directly or
indirectly as the measured current reading (Um), wherein the

respective pulsed voltage value of the pulsed alternating
voltage is then immediately switched over to the temporally

next pulsed voltage value and wherein the respective reading
difference between two successive measured current readings is

used to determine the ohmic insulation resistance between
network and earth, 
characterised in that
 during monitoring of
the transient phenomenon for evaluated suppression of an

interference frequency (f
interference
) which is superimposed on
the measured current or a variable derived therefrom, average

test samples of the measured current or a variable derived
therefrom are taken by arithmetic averaging at specific, 

directly succeeding measuring intervals (t
n
), 
in that
 the
transient phenomenon ends as soon as two successive average

test samples differ from one another to an adequately small
extent, and 
in that
 the last average test sample is considered
as the appropriate measured current reading for the

evaluation.
Method according to claim 1, 
characterised in that
 during
monitoring of the transient phenomenon the average test

samples are taken at average measuring intervals which become
longer over time.
Method according to claim 2, 
characterised in that
 the
starting value, used at the beginning of the monitoring

method, of the length of the average measuring interval is
selected to be just large enough that the size difference

between these average test samples cannot yet be reliably
established taking into consideration the transient phenomenon

for the largest values to be expected of the capacitative and
ohmic insulation resistance.
Method according to claim 3, 
characterised in that
 the
starting value of the average measured interval is selected

taking into consideration an infinitely large ohmic insulation
resistance.
Method according to claim 4, 
characterised in that
 the
starting value of the average measured interval is

automatically determined and selected according to the formula

t
n0
 = - LN (1-a)*Ri*Cemax
 
LN being the natural logarithm of the bracket value, Ri the

ohmic internal resistance of the network coupling for the
pulsed alternating voltage, Cemax the maximum capacitative

insulation resistance to be expected and a the just measurable
minimum percentage value change of the first average test

sample.
Method according to claim 5, 
characterised in that
 the
starting value of the average measured interval is

automatically determined and selected according to the formula

t

inasmuch as this starting value, due to the occurring
interfering frequency f
interference
, is greater than the starting
value produced by the equation


t
n0
 = -LN (1-a)*Ri*Cemax.

respective average measured interval is increased by a

constant factor relative to the respective previous average
measured interval.

characterised in that
 a
constant factor of approximately 1.5 to 1.7 is selected for

the increase in the average measured intervals.
Method according to claim 8, 
characterised in that
 an
optimised constant factor of 1.66 is selected for the increase

in the average measured intervals. 
Method according to any one of claims 6 to 9,

characterised in that
 when the starting value of the average
measured interval is determined, an initial frequency value

for the interference frequency is used as a base, such as, for
example, 25 Hz at a network frequency of 50 Hz, and, 
in that

when, within this measuring cycle, no two substantially equal
successive reading differences between two temporally

successive measured current readings, i.e. no two
substantially equal successive results for the ohmic

insulation resistance can be determined for the ohmic
insulation resistance, this reading difference is disregarded

and the initial frequency value for the starting value of the
average measured interval of the next measuring cycle is

automatically reduced or the average measured interval is
increased.
Method according to claim 10, 
characterised in that
 the
frequency value for the interference frequency is reduced for

the next respective measuring cycle by a specific factor, for
example halved, until either two substantially identical

successive results are found for the ohmic insulation
resistance or until a lower frequency value limit is found for

the interference frequency, such as 0.1 Hz.
Method according to claim 10 or 11, 
characterised in that

after reduction of the frequency value for the interference
frequency at the end of the measuring cycle for the ohmic

insulation resistance, i.e. at the end of the transient
phenomenon, the approximate size of the interference frequency

is determined by time measurement between the peaks and
troughs and, as a function thereof, the starting value of the 

average measured interval is correspondingly established for
the next measuring cycle.
Method according to claim 12, 
characterised in that

ulsed voltage values differing in amount, in
particular with two pulsed voltage values, one of the pulsed
