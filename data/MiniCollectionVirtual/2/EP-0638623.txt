<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to refrigerating mixtures,
more particularly to refrigerating mixtures utilizable in
circuits working according to the Rankine cycle.As known, R-12 (CCl2F2) is the product most widely used as
refrigerant for circuits working at middle-high temperatures,
while for the refrigeration at middle-low temperatures, in/
particular for commercial refrigeration, for the time being R-502
is used, i.e. a mixture of R-22 (CHClF2) and R-115
(CClF2CF3). It is also known that, because of the high
depleting potential of R-12 and R-115 with respect to ozone
present in the stratosphere, manufacturing and marketing of
such products, and more generally of chlorofluorocarbons
(CFC), will be restricted or banned within a few years as
stipulated by some International agreements (Montreal Protocol
and subsequent amendments).Therefore, the need of finding other products or
compositions capable of effectively replacing R-12 and R-502,
without causing environmental damages, is particularly felt.
For this purpose, it was suggested using hydrofluorocarbons
(HFC) or hydrochlorofluorocarbons (HCFC), whose depleting 
potential with respect to ozone (Ozone Depleting Potential,
ODP) is very low or even null, as very low is also their
contribution to the so called "greenhouse effect", measured by
the Global Warming Potential (GWP).However, for the time being, the proposed substitutive
products, such as R-134a (CF3-CH2F) and R-125 (CF3-CHF2), show
in many applications a refrigerant capacity, measured by the
Coefficient of Performance (COP), lower than that of R-12 and
R-502; for instance R-125, depending on the working
conditions, has a COP 10-15% lower than that of R-502.In order to overcome the drawbacks of single
refrigerants, the use of mixtures based on HCFC and/or HFC has
been proposed. However, if casual mixtures are employed, other
inconveniences are encountered. First of all, because of the
different volatility of the components, fractionation occurs
when passing from liquid phase to vapour phase and viceversa,
with a remarkable variation in the condensation and
evaporation temperatures, so as to impair even considerably
the efficiency of the refrigerating circuit. Moreover, the
filling up of the refrigerant, necessary in consequence of
unavoidable losses from the refrigerating plant, cannot be
carried out with the original mixture, but it is necessary to
proportion the various components according to the exact
composition of the mixture remained after fractionation, so as 
to restore the initial
