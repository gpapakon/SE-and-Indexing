<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a wastewater recycling unit having a filter apparatus for purifying the dirty water fed, a collection vessel for the purified dirty water after passing through the filter apparatus and a pump for delivery of the purified dirty water from the vessel to a consumer. For cleaning the filter apparatus, this can be reversibly pivoted from a first position, in which the dirty water is purified on passage through a filter and is delivered to the collection vessel, to a second position in which the filter can be backwashed with purified dirty water from the collection vessel. On backwashing the filter, the contaminated wastewater can be discharged into an outlet system via an outlet.

Water-recycling system comprising a filter device (4) for 
cleaning the dirty water supplied, a collecting tank (1) for 

the dirty water and a pump (18) for discharging the cleaned 
water from the tank to at least one user, characterised in 

that the filter device (4) is reversibly pivotable out of a 
first position, in which the dirty water is cleaned by passing 

through a filter and discharged into the collecting tank (1), 
into a second position, in which the filter can be backwashed 

with cleaned dirty water from the collecting tank (1), the 
contaminated effluent produced by backwashing of the filter 

being drainable into a drainage system via an outlet (7, 12). 
System according to claim 1, characterised in that the 
filter device (4) has a tubular housing (5) open on both 

sides, in which at least one in particular exchangeable filter 
is disposed, wherein pivoting of the filter device (4) is 

effected about a pivoting shaft (6) extending substantially 
perpendicular to the longitudinal axis of the tubular 

housing (5). 
System according to claim 1, characterised in that the 
filter device (4') has a cup-shaped housing (5') whose base 

(31) is provided with an aperture (32) and in which at least 
one preferably exchangeable filter (33) is disposed, wherein 

pivoting of the filter device (4') is effected about a 
pivoting shaft (6') extending substantially perpendicular to 

the longitudinal axis of the cup-shaped housing (5'). 
System according to claim 3, characterised in that the 
filter (33) is formed as a substantially closed filter basket, 

the aperture (32) in the housing base (31) opening directly 
into the filter interior. 
System according to claim 3 or 4, characterised by at 
least one nozzle (34), which is connected to the aperture (32) 

of the housing base (31) on the exterior and acts as an outlet 
from the filter device (4'), which nozzle can be brought into  

 
substantially fluid-tight and pressure-tight abutment with a 

backwash line (35) upon pivoting of the filter device (4') 
into the second position. 
System according to one of claims 1 to 5, characterised by 
an actuating device (9), in particular in the form of a 

hydraulically or pneumatically actuatable jack for carrying 
out the pivoting motion of the filter device (4, 4') from the 

first into the second position. 
System according to one of claims 2 to 6, characterised in 
that the pivoting shaft (6, 6') is disposed axially off-centre 

relative to the longitudinal axis of the housing (5, 5') in 
such a manner that, due to the force of gravity, the filter 

device (4, 4') pivots back automatically into the first 
position after the backwashing operation. 
System according to claim 7, characterised in that the 
jack is a single-acting cylinder and the point of application 

of the jack rod (10) of the jack relative to the first 
position of the filter device (4, 4') and the direction of the 

force of gravity lies under the pivoting shaft (6, 6'). 
System according to one of claims 1 to 8, characterised by 
a respective or common stop (8) for the filter device (4, 4') 

in the first and second positions. 
System according to one of claims 1 to 9, characterised 
by a limit switch (15), which is actuatable by the filter 

device (4, 4') upon pivoting into the second position and 
which triggers the start of backwashing. 
System according to one of claims 1 to 10, characterised 
by a switch (36), in particular float-type switch, in the rim 

region of the cup-shaped housing (5') or in the region of the 
end of the tubular housing (5) through which the dirty water 

is introduced, the switch triggering pivoting of the filter  
 

device (4, 4') into the second position upon rising of the 
dirty water level in the housing (5, 5'). 
System according to one of claims 1 to 11, characterised 
by an overflow (37) in the rim region of the cup-shaped 

housing (5') or in the region of the end of the tubular housing 
(5) through which the dirty water is introduced, which 

overflow diverts surplus dirty water indirectly or directly 
into the drainage system upon rising of the dirty water level 

in the housing (5, 5'). 
System according to one of claims 1 to 12, characterised 
by a device for cleaning the collecting tank (1) and/or 

aerating the cleaned dirty water contained in the collecting 
tank (1), which device is disposed above the water level in 

the collecting tank (1) and has at least one rotary nozzle 
(21) of small cross-section, which sprays cleaned dirty water 

out of the collecting tank (1) under pressure against the 
inside wall of the collecting tank (1) and/or the water level. 
System according to one of claims 1 to 13, characterised 
by a pump (18) with a pressure accumulator (19), which makes 

available the pressure necessary for discharging the cleaned 
dirty water to a user and for backwashing. 
System according to claim 14, characterised in that the 
pressure for discharging the cleaned dirty water to a user and 

the pressure for backwashing is in the region of 1 to 4 bar. 
System according to one of claims 1 to 15, characterised 
by a control device (13) by means of which the control of the 

pump (18), the actuating device (9) for the filter device 
(4, 4') and/or the cleaning or aerating device (21) is 

effected in a timed manner or as required via magnetic valves 
(14, 16, 23).  

 
System according to one of claims 1 to 16, characterised 
by a device for treating the cleaned dirty water with UV-light 

for the bacteriological improvement of the water quality. 
Method of cleaning a filter device of a water recycling 
system comprising a filter device for cleaning the dirty water 

supplied, a collecting tank for the dirty water cleaned after 
passing through a filter device, and a pump for discharging 

the cleaned dirty water from the tank to at least one user, 
comprising the following steps: 


pivoting of the filter device (4, 4') out of a first 
position, in which the dirty water is cleaned by passing 

through a filter and is passed into the collecting tank (1), 
into a second position; 
backwashing of the filter, in the direction opposite to that 
of filtering, with cleaned dirty water from the collecting 

tank (1); 
diversion of the effluent contaminated by backwashing of the 
filter into a drainage system (7, 12); and 
pivoting back of the filter device (4, 4') into the first 
position. 
Use of the effluent recycling system according to one of 
claims 1 to 17 for cleaning dirty water, in particular from
