<ABSTRACT>
A linerless plastic closure (10) is configured for side-sealing engagement with an associated container (C). The closure includes a circular top wall portion (12), and an annular skirt portion (14) depending from the top wall portion, and including an internal thread formation (16). A two-component side-seal arrangement is provided which includes a relatively rigid support annulus (32), and a relatively flexible sealing lip (30). The sealing lip (30) is movable into a position for sealingly engaging a generally outwardly facing surface of an associated container (C), with the relatively rigid support annulus (32) desirably acting to enhance the sealing effect of the sealing lip (30). Notably, the relatively rigid sealing annulus (32) further desirably acts to provide a self-centering action for the closure (10) during application to a container.

<DESCRIPTION>
 LINERLESS CLOSURE The present invention relates generally to a plastic closure for use with an associated container, and more particularly to a linerless closure including a side-seal arrangement comprising a support annulus, and an integral, relatively flexible sealing lip- Molded plastic closures for containers have become increasingly popular for closing and sealing the contents of containers, such as for use with carbonated and non-carbonated beverages, condiments, and other food products, as well as for use on non-food products, such as motor oil. While various plastic closure constructions have been known for a number of years, special design considerations must be made in order for the desired sealing to be effected, and to facilitate high-speed manufacture and application of such closures. In order to achieve the desired sealing performance, a number of heretofore known closure constructions have been of a composite nature, including a relatively rigid outer plastic shell and a relatively pliable and soft inner sealing liner, such as in U.S. Patents No. 4,343,754, No. 4,378,893, No. 4,407,422, and No. 4,497,795. Closures in 

accordance with these patents are configured to form a so-called top/side seal, in that the liner can sealingly engage both a generally upwardly facing surface of an associated container, as well as a generally outwardly facing, side surface of the container.While it will be appreciated that eliminating the inner sealing liner of such closure construction would decrease the attendant cost of its manufacturing use, it has heretofore proven difficult to provide a closure construction exhibiting the requisite strength, while at the same time including a sealing arrangement exhibiting sufficient flexibility and conformability to achieve the desired sealing engagement with associated containers. Development of a linerless, one-piece closure construction suitable for use on containers having pressurized contents has heretofore met with limited success.Another design consideration which must be addressed concerns application of closures. Experience has shown that a typical threaded closure can exhibit a tendency to skew during application, which is believed to result from the asymmetrical nature of the typical single helical thread formation within the closure. Specifically, the side of the closure at which the closure thread terminates at or near the top wall portion of the closure exhibits a relatively high degree of rigidity and strength. In contrast, the opposite side of a

 C L A I M S
1. A linerless closure for a container, comprising: a circular top wall portion; an annular skirt portion, depending integrally from said top wall portion, said skirt portion including an internal thread formation configured for engagement with said container; and side-seal means extending inwardly from said skirt portion for sealingly engaging a generally outwardly facing surface of said container, said side-seal means comprising an outer support annulus extending integrally inwardly from said skirt portion, and an inner sealing lip extending inwardly from said support annulus, said sealing lip being movable to a generally upwardly extending disposition relative to said support annulus so that said sealing lip sealingly engages the outwardly facing surface of said container.
2. A linerless closure in accordance with claim 1, including means for rigidifying said support annulus comprising a plurality of circumferentially spaced gussets extending between said support annulus and said skirt portion of said closure.
3. A linerless closure in accordance with claim 1, wherein said sealing lip includes at least one sealing rib for sealingly engaging said container.
4. A linerless closure in accordance with claim 1, including top-seal means depending from said top wall portion of said closure for sealingly 



engaging an upwardly facing surface of said container.
5. A linerless closure in accordance with any one of claims 1-4, wherein said sealing lip has an average axial thickness less than the average axial thickness of said support annulus.
6. A linerless closure in accordance with claim 5, wherein said side-seal means includes a stepped portion defining a change in axial thickness at the juncture of said outer support annulus and said inner sealing lip.
