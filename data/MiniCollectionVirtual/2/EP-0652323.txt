<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a sizing agent (size) for surface and bulk sizing which comprises an aqueous dispersion of colophony resin with starch and a naphthalenesulphonic acid-formaldehyde condensate, and to a process for the preparation of this agent in which the colophony resin is mixed with the other constituents at high shear rates.

<CLAIMS>
A sizing agent for the surface- and bulk sizing of paper, characterised in that it
consists of an aqueous dispersion of colophony resin, which is not saponified or

surface-saponified and which does not contain a modifying epoxy component, with
starch which is not alkali-treated and with a naphthalenesulphonic acid-formaldehyde

condensate.
A sizing agent according to claim 1, characterised in that the resin is an unfortified,
disproportionated, fortified or esterified resin, the base resin of which can be tall

resin, balsamic resin or wood rosin, or mixtures of resins such as these.
A sizing agent according to claim 1 or 2, characterised in that 0.5-99.5 % of the resin
is replaced by alkylketene dimers and/or an alkylsuccinic anhydride.
A sizing agent according to any one of claims 1 to 3, characterised in that 1-99 % of
the resin is replaced by waxes, fatty acids, paraffins, bitumen or mixtures thereof.
A sizing agent according to any one of claims 1 to 4, characterised in that the starch
is anionic, cationic or crystal starch or a mixture of starches such as these.
A sizing agent according to any one of claims 1 to 5, characterised in that the starch
is digested with inorganic or organic acids.
A sizing agent according to any one of claims 1 to 6, characterised in that it contains
5 - 50 % by weight starch and 0.5 - 10 % by weight of a naphthalenesulphonic acid-formaldehyde

condensate, with respect to the weight of resin and/or resin substitutes
in each case.
A sizing agent according to claim 7, characterised in that it contains 10-30 % by
weight starch. 
A sizing agent according to claim 7 or 8, characterised in that it contains 1-3 % by
weight of a naphthalenesulphonic acid-formaldehyde condensate.
A sizing agent according to claims 1 to 7, characterised in that it additionally contains
a precipitant in the form of an aluminium salt or of a mixture of aluminium salts.
A sizing agent according to any one of claims 1 to 8, characterised in that it
additionally contains a cationic compound.
A method of producing the sizing agent according to any one of claims 1 to 9,
characterised in that the colophony resin, which is not saponified or surface-saponified,

is mixed with the other constituents under high shear.
A method according to claim 10, characterised in that mixing is effected in a highpressure
homogeniser.
A method according to claim 10, characterised in that mixing is effected by stirring
at 2000 rpm at least.
