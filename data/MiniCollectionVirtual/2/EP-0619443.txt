<ABSTRACT>
Connection piece (3) which is fitted at the end of a wire cable (2) and is intended for connecting the wire-cable end (1) to means for absorbing tensile forces caused by longitudinal stressing in the wire cable (2), in the case of which the outer dimensions of the connection piece (3), in the direction transverse to the extended axis of the wire-cable end (1), are essentially equal to or smaller than the diameter of the wire cable (2), and in the case of which the wire cable is compressed in its end region to such an extent that the wire-cable end (1) fits into a cutout (6) which is provided in order to receive said end and is located in the connection piece (3).

Connection piece (3), which is mounted on the end of a wire 
cable (2), for connecting the wire cable end (1) to means for 

taking up tensile forces caused by longitudinal stresses in the 
wire cable (2), characterized in that the external dimensions of 

the connection piece (3) in the direction transverse to the 
extended axis of the wire cable end (1) are substantially equal 

to or smaller than the diameter of the wire cable (2) and the 
wire cable is compressed in its end region before it is connected 

to the connection piece (3) until the wire cable end (1) fits 
into a cutout (6), provided for receiving the latter, in the 

connection piece (3) of a smaller opening clearance than the 
diameter of the wire cable (2), and in that the external 

dimensions of the connection piece (3) in the direction of the 
extended axis of the wire cable end (1) are greater than the 

length of the compressed wire cable end (1) introduced into the 
cutout (6). 
Connection piece according to Claim 1, characterized in that 
it substantially has the shape of a pin (4) which is provided in 

its end region (5) facing the wire cable (2) with a cutout (6), 
formed preferably by drilling, for receiving the compressed wire 

cable end (1). 
Connection piece according to Claim 1, characterized in that 
it substantially has the shape of a sleeve which in its end 

region facing the wire cable serves to receive the compressed 
wire cable end and in its end region remote from the wire cable 

serves to receive an intermediate member which connects the 
sleeve to the means for taking up tensile forces caused by 

longitudinal stresses in the wire cable. 
Connection piece according to one of Claims 1 to 3, 
characterized in that it is compressed, preferably in the shape 

of a substantially regular hexagon (10), in its end region (5) 
facing the wire cable (2) and serving to receive the compressed  

 
wire cable end (1) to increase the static friction between the 

wire cable end (1) and the cutout wall (9) surrounding the 
latter. 
Connection piece according to Claim 1 or 2, characterized 
in that it substantially has the shape of a pin (4) which is 

provided with a thread (8) in its end region (7) remote from the 
wire cable, and in that the means for taking up tensile forces 

caused by longitudinal stresses in the wire cable preferably 
comprise a nut which fits onto this thread. 
Connection piece according to Claim 1 or 2, characterized 
in that it substantially has the shape of a pin which is provided 

with at least one annular groove in its end region remote from 
the wire cable, and in that the means for taking up tensile 

forces caused by longitudinal stresses in the wire cable 
preferably comprise a spring ring which fits into the annular 

groove. 
Connection piece according to one of Claims 1 to 4, 
characterized in that it substantially has the shape of a pin or 

a sleeve and is provided with at least one transverse hole in its 

end region remote from the wire cable, and in that the means for 
taking up tensile forces caused by longitudinal stresses in the 

wire cable preferably comprise a holding bar, which fits into the 
transverse hole, of a greater length than the diameter of the pin 

or of the sleeve. 
Connection piece according to one of Claims 1 to 7, 
characterized in that the external dimensions of the connection 

piece (3) in the direction transverse to the extended axis of the 
wire cable end (1) are smaller than 1.175 times, preferably 

smaller than 1.1 times, the diameter of the wire cable (2). 
Connection piece according to one of Claims 1 to 7, 
characterized in that the external dimensions of the connection 

piece (3) in the direction transverse to the extended axis of the  
 

wire cable end (1) are at most 5% larger than the diameter of the 
wire cable (2). 
Connection piece according to one of Claims 1 to 9, 
characterized in that the internal dimensions of the cutout (6) 

in the connection piece (3), serving to receive the compressed 
wire cable end (1), in the direction transverse to the axis of 

the wire cable end (1) are smaller than 0.86 times, preferably 
smaller than 0.8 times, the diameter of the wire cable (2).
