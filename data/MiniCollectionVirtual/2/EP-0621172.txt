<ABSTRACT>
A caliper brake assembly (10) for a bicycle having a 
fork (12), a wheel having an axle (32) mounted in said fork, and a 

brake disk (14) mounted on the wheel, the assembly including a 
caliper housing (38) mounted on the fork in a position to 

bridge the brake disk, the housing including an arm (34) 
connected to the axle and a blind bore (40) in the housing 

having a closed end and an open end, a piston (52,54) mounted in 
the bore on each side of the disk, each piston including 

a brake pad (56,58), a master cylinder assembly (42) connected to the 
bore, the caliper housing including passages (94,96) connecting 

the open end of the blind bore to the closed end of the 
blind bore, and a lever assembly (110) mounted on the bicycle 

for actuating the master cylinder assembly to pressurize 
the bore and move the pistons into engagement with the 

disk to brake the rotary motion of the wheel.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates 
to a cable 
applied caliper type hydraulic double piston disk brake 
assembly for a bicycle. Caliper type disk brakes, hydraulic or 
mechanical, generally provided on bicycles include a 
caliper having a fixed brake pad on one side of the brake 
disk and a movable brake pad mounted on a piston on the 
other side of the brake disk. The brake is actuated by a 
hand operated lever mounted on the handlebar of the 
bicycle which is connected to the caliper by a cable. 
Compensation for wear of the brake pads can be adjusted 
for on the lever and on the caliper body to vary the 
stroke of operation of the cable. (e.g. US-A-5,193,833) One type of hydraulic brake on the market is 
connected to the fork by two screws that are located 
above the axle. (e.g. GB-A-1 274 412) There is no part of the brake that goes 
down to the axle. To use this brake requires buying a 
special fork that accepts this brake. Another type of  
 
brake on the market can be adapted to most forks. (e.g. US-A-5,259,483) 
This brake has an arm that goes down to the axle. However, 
you must disconnect the cable and a fork hose clamp to 
remove the wheel. The brake stays with the wheel when 
the wheel is removed. This is cumbersome and takes a lot 
of time, and special tools are required to remove the 
caliper. The two types of disk brakes presently on the 
market have one fixed pad and one movable pad. To allow 
the fixed pad to move away from the disk, the brake in 
one case and the disk in the other are mounted on pins 
which matingly engage corresponding bores. The pins will 
cause minimal drag when a good design is well maintained. 
However if the design is poor or any rust or dirt get 
between the pins and bores, the drag will increase. Even 
a minimal drag will irritate and impair the power of the 
rider. US-A-3,935,930 discloses a pressure driven disk 
brake which comprises a braking mechanism and an 
operating lever including a master cylinder and an 
adjusting member. The braking mechanism is mounted on a 
wheel and connected to said master cylinder by a 
pressure fluid supply conduit. Wear of the brake pads 
can be adjusted at the adjusting member of the operating 
lever and at an adjusting member of the braking 
mechanism. FR-A-2 246 439 discloses a caliper brake 
assembly for a bicycle which comprises a caliper housing 
having a pair of piston assemblies mounted therein for 
movement into engagement with opposite sides of a brake 
disc and wherein each piston assembly includes a brake 
pad. GB-A-2

<CLAIMS>
A caliper brake assembly (10) for a bicycle having 
a frame, a fork (12) mounted on the frame, a wheel supported on 

the fork (12) and a brake disk (14) mounted on the wheel, said 
brake assembly (10) comprising: 


a caliper housing (38) having a pair of piston 
assemblies (48; 50) mounted therein for movement into 

engagement with opposite sides of said brake disk (14), each 
piston assembly (48; 50) including a brake pad (56; 58), 

said brake assembly (10) 
characterized by
: 
a master cylinder (42) in said caliper housing (38) 
operatively connected to pressurize said piston assemblies 

(48; 50) for movement into engagement with said brake disk 
(14), and 
means (102-108) mounted on the bicycle for actuating 

said master cylinder (42) to move said piston assemblies 
(48; 50) into engagement with said brake disk (14). 
The caliper brake assembly (10) according to claim 
1 including passage means (94; 96) in said caliper housing (38) 

interconnecting said master cylinder (42) with said piston 
assemblies (48; 50) and
 
   a bleed housing (44) in said caliper housing (38) for 

releasing air from said passage means (94; 96). 
The caliper brake assembly (10) according to claim 
2 including a cap (76) mounted on one end of said caliper 

housing (38) in a spaced relation to one of said pistons (48; 
50), said cap (76) being adjustable to maintain pad gap. 
The caliper brake assembly (10) according to claim 
3 including a limit stop (92) in a bore (40) at said one end of 

the caliper housing (38) to prevent over travel of said cap (76) 
to prevent damage to the piston assembly (48; 50) and brake disk 

(14) due to wear of the brake pads (56; 58).  
 
The caliper brake assembly (10) according to any 
of the preceeding claims 1, said caliper housing (38) having an 

arm (34) connected to the axle (32) and including means (24) for 
pivotally mounting said caliper housing (38) on the fork (12) 

whereby said caliper housing (38) can be pivoted away from the 
fork (12) when said arm (34) is released from the wheel axle 

(32) to allow for the removal of the wheel and brake disk (14) 
from the bicycle. 
The caliper brake assembly (10) according to claim 
5 wherein said arm (34) includes a slot (36) for connecting the 

arm (34) to the axle (32) of the wheel, said arm (34) being 
located to pivot in a direction counter to the direction of 

rotation of the wheel whereby said axle (32) will be seated in 
said slot (36). 
The caliper brake assembly (10) according to claim 
5 or 6 including a clamp (20) and a compressible tape (23) 

mounted in said fork (12) to accommodate various size forks 
(12). 
The caliper brake assembly (10) according to any 
of the preceeding claims including means (26) for adjusting the 

position of the caliper housing (38) to center said brake pads 
(56; 58) with respect to the brake disk (14).
