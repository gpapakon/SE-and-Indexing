<ABSTRACT>
Improved structure for protection glasses, 
characterised by being glasses with therapeutical purposes 

in the treatment of ocular diseases where an ocular filter 
is necessary agains ultraviolet beams, being possible to 

incorporate in said structure, cristals for the vision of 
persons who need them due to problems of myopia, 

hypermetropia, etc.

<DESCRIPTION>
The object of the present invention is based on a 
structure for protection of the eyes in the whole contour 
of the incidenceof light over the same. For that reason 
the invention is based on glasses of normal appearance 
which incorporatea series of elements destined to that 
end. Some patients in the period of recovery after 
certain ocular surgical operations have to avoid direct 
exposures to the light either solar or artificial. On 
theother hand, other patients have to avoid certain kinds 
of determined radiations within the light spectrum. In 
this manner, there are certain interventions which require 
avoiding, specifically, any radiation whose wave-length is 
in a sector of the spectrum such as ultraviolet radiation. To that end, the process of recovery of a patient 
after an intervention was characterised either by avoiding 
the exposure of any kind of radiation to the eye, or 
wearing glasses specially equipped with filters suitable 
for the type of radiation to be avoided. These glasses had 
an essential function which was ocular protection without 
caring about the aesthetic or the appearance of the 
glasses. One can thus say that the protecting element was 
essentailly functional and only destined to thatend, that 
is, giving freedom to the patient in his process of 
recovery so that he may carry on a normal life. The fact of using means of protection included in 
a structure such glasses, would liberate the patient from 
the discomfort of having to use bandages which would 
completely eliminate the visibility.  In this case, the object of the invention has an 
additional characteristic which would allow for complete 
freedom of the patient in his process of recovery and 
continuation during the time indicated by the 
ophthalmologist which perform his treatment, said 
characteristic being that of incorporating ultraviolet 
light filtersto a structure with a completely normal 
appearance, so that the patient would not be hindered 
during his normal social life by carrying glasses which 
include a higher degree of aesthetic appearance to the 
contrary of the ones known up to now, which due to thier 
eccentric shape obliged the patient to stay in his usual 
recovery place during the treatment process. In order to understand better the object of the 
present invention a practical and preferred embodiment of 
the same is represented in the accompanying drawings. Figure 1 represents in perspective a general 
aspect of the improved structure for protection glasses. Figure 2a represents a usual

Improved structure for protection glasses, 
characterised in the objective of serving for treatment 

after an ocular intervention which would need the 
elimination of falling ultraviolet radiation onto the eyes 

of the patient. Characterised in its structure by 
composing a front side and two lateral sides which form 

the main body to which they are adapted by means of hinges 
dimensioned for the size of the structure, two side-arms 

for the gripping of the structure on both sides of the 
face ofthe pateint at the zone corresponding to the ears. 
Improved structure for protection glasses, 
according to the previous claim, characterised in that at 

the front part of the structure there is a bridge for 
adaptation at the upper zone of the patient's nose, both 

sides of the structure being symmetrical with respect to 
said bridge. Said bridge has, at the interior side 

thereof, two protuberances adaptable to the sides of the 
nose from the upper zone to the middle zone of the same. 
Improved structure for protection glasses, 
according to claim 1, characterised by having in two 

symmetrical empty zones of the structure at the front part 
of the same, two filtering elements eliminating 

ultraviolet radiation such as conventional cristal for 
glasses which intervene in the whole filed of vision of 

each eye. 
Improved structure for protection glasses, 
according to claim 1, characterised by having at each 

lateral side, an empty space destined for placing a 
filtering element eliminating ultraviolet radation each 

filter intervening in the whole field of lateral vision of 
 

each eye. 
Improved structure for protection glasses, 
according to claim 1, characterised in that by means of a 

recess or notch in the contour of each front empty space, 
graduated cristals may be adapted for the use of the 

patient in the case of need of the latter, said graduated 
cristals may be located together with the ultraviolet 

radiation filtering elements due to the standarised shape 
of the structure of the invention, siad adding of 

graduated cristals being on the interior side.
