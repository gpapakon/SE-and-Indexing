<ABSTRACT>
This invention relates to an acceleration/deceleration control system of a numeric controller for effecting 
acceleration/deceleration control of a tool in the vicinity of a stroke end. The system makes it possible to move the 

tool by utilizing the stroke to maximum. The tool moves along a path (1) within a region (20) encompassed by a 
stroke end (2), and executes machining such as cutting. The movement of the tool is effected by the numeric controller 

in accordance with a machining program. The tool starts from the start point (P1) and moves along machining blocks 
(N1, N2, ..., N10) to an end point (P2). The tool moves on the basis of ordinary feed speed control in zones other 

than the machining blocks (N5 and N6). In the zone of the machining block (N5) near the stroke end (2), however, 
the tool is decelerated to a very low speed before it reaches a point (P3) of the stroke end (2). After moving from a 

point (P3) to a point (P4), the tool goes outside the stroke end (2). It is again accelerated according to the ordinary 
feed speed control when entering the block (N6) again.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an acceleration/deceleration
control apparatus for a numerical control
apparatus, and more specifically, to an acceleration/deceleration
control apparatus for a numerical control apparatus
for carrying out an acceleration/deceleration control of a
tool in the vicinity of a stroke end.Conventionally, a numerically controlled machine
tool is arranged such that when a tool is going to move
beyond the stroke end set by a limit switch of a machine
tool or when the tool is going to enter the prohibited
region of a stored stroke limit designated by a program or
setting data, an error code is displayed as well as the
tool is decelerated and stopped.Nevertheless, according to this method, since the
tool cannot stop at the stroke end if a sufficient distance
necessary to deceleration and stop is not set, a region in
which machining can be carried out is set smaller than the
size of a stroke. That is, there is a problem that the
region in which machining can be carried out is restricted 
more smaller than a region set by an intrinsic stroke end
of a machine tool.JP-A-59016008 discloses an NC system with pre-movement
inhibition checking. DE-A-2628961 discloses a method for
varying the feed rate of a machine tool dependent upon the
determination of a stroke end.Taking the above into consideration, an object of the
present invention is to provide an
acceleration/deceleration control apparatus for a numerical
control apparatus capable of moving a tool by making
maximum use of a stroke.To solve the above problem according to the present
invention, there is provided an acceleration/deceleration
control apparatus for a numerical control apparatus for
carrying out acceleration/deceleration control of a tool in
the vicinity of a stroke end, the apparatus comprising:
stroke end determination means for determining whether
or not said tool has moved beyond said stroke end; and:tool feed speed control means for controlling a feed
speed of said tool so that the feed speed of said tool is
set to a minute speed in the vicinity of said stroke end
when said stroke end determination means determines that
said tool has moved beyond said stroke end; characterised
in that: the stroke end determination means makes a
determination based upon a pre-read machining block; and
said tool feed speed control means determines the feed
speed of said tool using a deceleration distance determined
from a maximum feed speed of said tool, said minute speed
and an acceleration constant.The stroke end determination means
