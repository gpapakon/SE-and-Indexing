<ABSTRACT>
A remanufacturing method of a process 
cartridge (B) detachably mountable to an image forming 

apparatus includes disassembling the process 
cartridge (B) into a first frame (12) having a developer 

accommodating portion for accommodating a developer 
and a second frame (15) having a developer carrying member 

for carrying the developer supplied from the developer 
accommodating portion toward an image bearing member (9), 

thus exposing an opening of the first frame (12) for 
permitting movement of the developer from the first 

frame (12) to the second frame (13); removing residual which is 

resulted from a covering member having been used for 
sealing the opening and which remains around the 

opening, wherein the covering member has a sealing 
portion for sealing the opening and an extension for 

permitting the sealing portion to be torn with a part 
thereof remaining around the opening to open the 

opening, by pulling the extension, wherein the 
residual is a part of the sealing portion; mounting a 

fresh covering member to seal the opening; then 
supplying the developer accommodating portion with a 

fresh developer; and then engaging the first (12) and 
second frames (13) together.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a process
cartridge remanufacturing or recycling method, a
process cartridge and an image forming apparatus to
which the process cartridge is detachably mountable.The image forming apparatus includes a laser
beam printer, LED printer, an electrophotographic
copying machine, a facsimile machine and a word
processor, for example.In an image forming apparatus such as a
printer, a uniformly charged photosensitive drum is
selectively exposed to light so that a latent image is
formed, and the latent image is visualized by toner
into a toner image, which in turn is transferred onto
a recording material. In such an apparatus,
maintenance operations for various parts have to be
performed by an expert service man with the result of
inconveniences on the user side.In view of this, a photosensitive drum, a
charger, a developing device and a cleaning device or
the like are unified into a cartridge. In this case,
by loading the cartridge into a main assembly of the
image forming apparatus by the user, replenishment of
toner, exchange of parts such as image bearing member 
having reached the ends of service lives, are
accomplished, thus facilitating the maintenance
operations (process cartridge system). The process
cartridge system is disclosed in U.S. Patents Nos.
3,985,436, 4,500,195, 4,540,268, 4,637,701 and so on.With this, the users can perform, in effect,
maintenance operations, by themselves by simply
exchanging the cartridge without the necessity for the
maintenance operations by service men at regular
intervals, and in addition, the toner is also supplied.
Thus, an operativity of a copying machine, printer or the
like is improved.Recently however, re-manufacturing of the process
cartridge is desired.EP-A-0485271 describes a cartridge recycling method
applicable to cartridges having peel-type seals to
contain the toner before use. Such seals, when removed
for use of the cartridge, leave no part of the seal
attached to the toner frame.FR-A-2620973 describes a cartridge having a tear-type
seal, and a recycling method wherein unused toner is
cleared from the cartridge prior to refilling with a
measured amount of new toner material.Accordingly, it is a concern of the present
invention to provide a process cartridge remanufacturing
method, a process cartridge and an image forming 
apparatus, by which a used process cartridge is
remanufactured to effectively utilize the resources.It is another concern of the present invention to
provide a process cartridge re-manufacturing method, a

<CLAIMS>
A remanufacturing method of a process cartridge
detachably mountable to an image forming apparatus,

comprising the steps of:

disassembling said process cartridge (B) into a
first frame (14) having a developer accommodating portion

(12a) for accommodating a developer (t) and a second
frame (115) having an electrophotographic photosensitive

member (9), and a developer carrying member (12) for
carrying the developer supplied from said developer

accommodating portion toward the electrophotographic
photosensitive member to develop a latent image formed on

said electrophotographic photosensitive member, thus
exposing an opening of said first frame which is adapted

to permit movement of the developer from said first frame
to said second frame when the first and the second frame are engaged together;
then removing, by rubbing with a material (66)
impregnated with a solvent, residue (26a) which has

resulted from a covering member having been used for
sealing the opening and which has remained adjacent the

opening, wherein said covering member has a sealing
portion (26) for sealing the opening and an extension 

(25) for permitting the sealing portion to be torn with
a part thereof remaining along the opening to open the

opening, by pulling the extension, wherein the residue is
a part of the sealing portion;
then mounting a fresh covering member (26,100) to
seal the opening;
then supplying said developer accommodating portion
with a fresh developer; and
then engaging said first and second frames together.
A method according to claim 1, wherein the material
is waste or a sponge.
A method according to claim 1 or 2, wherein the
solvent is alcohol.
A method according to claim 3, wherein the alcohol
is isopropyl alcohol, methanol or ethanol.
A method according to any preceding claim, wherein
the fresh covering member is mounted to said first frame

by a bonding material to seal the opening. 
A method according to any of claims 1 to 4, wherein
the fresh covering member is mounted to said first frame

by heat-fusing to seal the opening.
A method according to any preceding claim, wherein
the fresh covering member (100) is a peeling type tape

for permitting the opening to open by peeling it off.
A method according to any of claims 1 to 6, wherein
the fresh covering member is a tear tape for permitting

the opening to open by tearing it off.
A method according to claim 1, wherein said first
frame has a charging roller for charging said

electrophotographic photosensitive member, and said
second frame has a developer roller as said developer

carrying member and a cleaning blade for removing
developer from the electrophotographic photosensitive

member.
A method according to any preceding claim, wherein
said photosensitive member is in the form of a drum. 
A method according to any preceding claim, wherein
said residue is resin material.
A method according to claim 11, wherein said resin
material is polyethylene resin, viny
l acetate resin or
monomer resin.
