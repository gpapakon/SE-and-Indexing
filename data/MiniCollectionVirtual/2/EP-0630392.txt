<ABSTRACT>
A matrix resin such as a polycarbonate/polyester blend, a polycarbonate, a vinyl aromatic copolymer or an acrylate polymer or copolymer is admixed in a composition with poly(phenylene ether), and/or with a poly(phenylene ether) concentrate containing poly(phenylene ether), polystyrene, a vinyl aromatic copolymer, polyamide, polycarbonate, polyester, poly(alkyl acrylate), and/or poly(alkyl methacrylate). The compositions may also optionally contain additional vinyl aromatic copolymer as a separate component, impact modifiers, thermoplastic molding materials including polystyrene, polyolefin, polyamide, poly(vinyl chloride), polyurethane, poly(methyl methacrylate) and polyacetal, and conventional additives such as dyes and pigments. The compositions when molded, particularly when the poly(phenylene ether) content thereof is low (for example, 5 weight percent or less) show a desirably low gloss, and a desirable balance of other properties.

 POLYMERS AND POLYMER BLENDS MODIFIED WITH POLY(PHENYLENE ETHER)This invention relates to compositions of thermoplastic polymers and polymer blends which have been modified with poly(phenylene ether), and to methods of melt•«•» 5 processing and molding such compositions.\It is frequently desired that articles molded from thermoplastic polymers and polymer blends have low gloss. It is known that gloss can be reduced in a molded article by, for example, adding a filler such as talc to the molding composition, lowering the temperature of the mold, or etching on the mold a pattern which becomes imprinted on the surface of the 10 article. It has been found, however, that an article characterized by reduced gloss can also be obtained by molding it from the poly(phenylene ether) modified compositions of this invention.In one aspect, this invention involves a composition of matter containing, in admixture, 15 (a/a) a blend of polycarbonate and polyester; and(b/a) (i) poly(phenylene ether), (ii) a blend of poly(phenylene ether) with one or more of components (A) to (G), as follows: (A) polystyrene, (B) a random, alternate, block, hydrogented block or grafted copolymer prepared from a vinyl aromatic compound and one or more members of the group consisting of a vinyl nitrite 20 compound, a diene, an alkyl acrylate, an alkyl methacrylate, glycidyl methacrylate, ethylene/propyiene/diene copolymer, maleic anhydride, an alkyl or aryl maleimide compound, and an oxazoline compound, (C) polyamide, (D) polycarbonate, (E) polyester, (F) poly(alkyl acrylate), and (G) poly(alkyl methacrylate), or (iii) a mixture thereof. 25 In another aspect, this invention involves a method of molding an article comprising (I) forming a composition by melting in a molding machine components (a/a) and (b/a) which have not previously been melted together, said components (a/a) and (b/a) comprising(a/a) a blend of polycarbonate and polyester; and30 (b/a) (i) poly(phenylene ether), (ii) a blend of poly(phenylene ether) with one or more of components (A) to (G), as follows: (A) polystyrene, (B) a random, alternate, block, hydrogenated block or grafted copolymer prepared from a vinyl aromatic compound and one or more members of the group consisting of a vinyl nitrile compound, a diene, an alkyl acrylate, an alkyl methacrylate, glycidyl 35 methacrylate, ethylene/propylene/diene copolymer, maleic anhydride, an alkyl or aryl maleimide compound, and an oxazoline compound, (C) polyamide, (D) polycarbonate, (E) polyester, (F) poly(alkyl acrylate), and
