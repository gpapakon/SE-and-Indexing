<ABSTRACT>
A technique for screening an image for half-tone reproduction 
by image reproduction apparatus including a marking 

device which is operative to mark a medium along a multiplicity 
of parallel marking lines including the steps of providing a 

digital representation of density values of an original image, 
storing dot shape information representative of a screen function 

in a line-by-line, input density-by-input density arrangement and 
extracting the dot shape information from storage for the density 

values in the form of information that designates on and off 
points for each marking line. Apparatus for carrying out the 

technique is also disclosed.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to screened image reproduction
and more particularly to a method and apparatus for
electronically generating a screened reproduction of an image.Electronic screening for image reproduction is well
known in the art. According to a well known technique described
in U.S. Patent US-A-4 456 924 of the present assignee, for each
screened dot, a multiplicity of coordinates of a laser plotter
are translated into screen-cell coordinates. A corresponding
cell memory is preloaded with threshold values, defining a cell
memory matrix. Input digitized scanned density values of an
image, such as a color separation, are compared with the threshold
values, pixel by pixel. The results provide an on/off control
input for a laser plotter.There are known threshold value based screening techniques
which provide only screen angles having rational tangents.
These techniques have the disadvantage of very large storage
requirements for high-quality color screens.The above-described methods have the further disadvantage
of limiting the screen function to such as can be described
by single valued functions.U.S. Patent US-A-4 825 298 to Ikuta and Murai describes a
technique for generating a screened reproduction of an image in
which the density distribution of a given screen dot is expressed
in three dimensions, wherein the area of the screen dot is expressed
along X and Y axes and the density is expressed along a Z
axis perpendicular thereto.A film coordinate generator generates film coordinates
(u,v), corresponding to the position of an exposure beam on a
recording film, which position is detected by encoders. The film 
coordinates are, in turn, supplied to a screen coordinate generator
to be converted into virtual screen coordinates (x,y). A
beam control signal generator receives the coordinates and an
image density signal corresponding to the position of the exposure
beam, to output a signal controlling the exposure beam.Operation of the signal generator is such that one
coordinate value, for example x, is applied together with the
image density value to a store containing corresponding upper and
lower values of the other coordinate y, satisfying the screen dot
function. When the received y coordinate, corresponding to the
beam position, is between those two limit values, the output
signal indicates activation of the beam.The technique of U.S. Patent US-A-4 825 298 has the advantage
over the aforementioned threshold-based methods of allowing
non-monotonic screen functions, but in common with them
