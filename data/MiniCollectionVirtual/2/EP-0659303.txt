<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a thyristor control set for the power supply to and regulation of electrical consumers, especially electric motors, with a switching signal which can be generated by an overcurrent circuit-breaker to control a power switch. The switching signal (ES) of the overcurrent circuit-breaker can be fed to a time-switch device (ZS) shutting off the thyristor, which controls the power switch (LS) with a second, delayed switching signal (WS). Thyristor control sets of this kind are used to supply power to and regulate electrical consumers.

<CLAIMS>
Thyristor control unit for the power supply and 
power regulation of electrical loads (EV), in particular 

of electric motors, with a switching signal (ES) which 
can be generated by an overcurrent release and is used to 

control a circuit-breaker (LS), characterized in that the 
switching signal (ES) which can be generated by the 

overcurrent release can be switched over to a time 
switching device (ZS) which effects the turning-off of 

the thyristor and effects the control of the circuit-breaker 
(LS) with a second switching signal (WS) which 

follows the switching signal (ES) after a defined delay 
time. 
Thyristor control unit according to Claim 1, 
characterized in that the defined delay time of the time 

switching device (ZS) can be set in the region around 
200 ms. 
Thyristor control unit according to Claim 1 and 
2, characterized in that the time switching device (ZS) 

is an integral part of the circuit-breaker (LS).
