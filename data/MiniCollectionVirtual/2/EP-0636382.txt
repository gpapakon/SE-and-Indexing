<ABSTRACT>
A balloon catheter having an inflatable balloon (10) in which the 
outer surface of the inflatable balloon is surrounded by an elastomeric 

sleeve (20). The sleeve is attached throughout at least a majority of 
its area to the balloon outer surface to provide pin hole and abrasion 

resistance. Preferably, the inflatable balloon is made of a flexible 
material of less elasticity than the material of the elastomeric sleeve. 

Thus the balloon expands to a generally limited maximum transverse 
dimension, while the collapse of the balloon is facilitated by the 

elastomeric sleeve.

<DESCRIPTION>
Balloon catheters are well-known devices in which
the catheter carries an inflatable balloon to occlude and seal
a body space, to expand a blood vessel through pressurized
inflation of the balloon, or for any other desired purpose
which may typically but not necessarily be a therapeutic
purpose in the medical field. In the case of dilatation
balloon catheters for angioplasty, for example a PTCA
procedure, the catheter balloon is generally made out of a
thin, strong material which is of relatively low resilience.
For example, the catheter balloon may be made out of biaxially
oriented polyethylene terephthalate (PET) or a polyamide
material such as nylon. Such strong, flexible materials are
commonly used for angioplasty balloons, and have the advantage
that they are flexible but inelastic so that they can expand
outwardly to a predetermined diameter, and then cease further
expansion at normal pressures, to avoid damage to the artery
wall by over expansion.One difficulty which is found with such biaxially
oriented balloons is that, since they are typically very thin-walled,
they can be easily punctured through abrasion or the 
like, even though they have a high tensile strength. Thus, pin
holes and ruptures are fairly common when such catheter
balloons are used in contact with rough surfaces. Also, tiny
flaws in the mold of such balloons can create weak spots, since
the balloons are so thin-walled. However, it is impractical
to increase the wall thickness of these biaxially oriented
materials, since then they become too stiff, with high flexural
moduli, with the result that such balloons do not collapse
properly on deflation to facilitate easy withdrawal from the
vascular system of a patient.Accordingly, there is a need for a balloon
catheter in which the catheter balloon is strong and relatively
inelastic, without being subject to the formation of pin holes
in the molding process, or tears in the balloon wall through
abrasion. At the same time, the balloon must still be easily
collapsible down to a small diameter upon deflation.Also, there is a need to provide such catheter
balloons with an improved lubricity, or for them to be
facilitated to carry a therapeutic agent such as an
anticoagulant, particularly in the case of angioplasty
balloons. EP-A-0420 488 discloses an expander member for
attachment to a medical catheter comprising (a) an outer
biaxially-oriented tubular polymeric film layer exhibiting
relatively high polymer crystallinity, and (b) an inner
polimeric plastic film layer adhered to said
