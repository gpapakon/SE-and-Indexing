<ABSTRACT>
Two semiconductor laser light sources (2,6) for
outputting light of two properly selected wavelengths are

employed as excitation light sources. That is, as
excitation light sources, there are used a first

semiconductor laser excitation light source (2) for exciting
ion from a base level to a laser low level or an energy

level higher than the laser low level and a second
semiconductor laser excitation light source (6) having a

wavelength different from that of the first excitation light
source for exciting ion from a laser low level to a laser

high level. For example, an amplification fiber (1) uses a
fluoro zirconate glass as a base material. Two multiple

wavelength couplers (3,7) are disposed at the input side of
the amplification fiber (1), The multiple wavelength

couplers (3,7) are connected to the first excitation light
source (2) and the second excitation light source (6),

respectively. An isolator (4) is disposed at a signal input
port at the further input side of the multiple wavelength

couplers (3,7), and an another isolator (5) is disposed at
an output port of the amplification fiber (1).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a laser amplifier and
oscillator using a medium doped with a rare earth element as
a gain medium and using a semiconductor laser as an
excitation light source, and a method and apparatus for
laser amplification using the same.A laser apparatus using a crystal or glass medium
doped with a rare earth element as an active medium, that is,
a laser oscillator and amplifier or the like is widely
applied to information communication industries and
mechanical engineering fields. An optical fiber amplifier
in a large yield solid laser for metal processing and an
optical fiber communication system is a typical example of
its application.The efficiency, size, service life, and mechanical
stability of the laser oscillator and amplifier are mainly
determined depending on an excitation light source. A
semiconductor laser used as an excitation light source is
superior to a solid laser and a fiber laser in these
respects. Therefore, considering equipment applicability,
it is preferred to employ a system (LD excitation system)
using a semiconductor laser (laser diode: LD) as an
excitation light source. A solid laser and a fiber laser
used as an excitation light source have many more
disadvantages than the semiconductor laser in various
respects. In particularly, apart from the fact that the
solid and fiber lasers are disadvantageous as compared with
the LD in view of efficiency, size, mechanical stability,
and service life, these lasers are disadvantageous in that a
small number of passive optical parts in a bandwidth of 1.05
µm in wavelength is provided. For example, an optical 
isolator with its low loss and high isolation is not
practically used.In such a laser apparatus, energy is supplied to rare
earth ion by means of light excitation. Thus, in order to
ensure operation with high efficiency, it is particularly
important to select a wavelength of an excitation light
source. However, some kinds of rare earth ions do not match
well a wavelength of a semiconductor laser in optimal
excitation wavelength, i.e., ion absorption wavelength
bandwidth, making it difficult to ensure LD excitation
caused by a semiconductor laser with its single wavelength.
Thus, it may be required to use a light source other than LD.
In particular, in the case where an ion forming a self-termination
system whose laser low level service life is
longer than laser high level service life is used as a gain
medium, as shown in the following example, the wavelength of
excitation light is limited more significantly,
