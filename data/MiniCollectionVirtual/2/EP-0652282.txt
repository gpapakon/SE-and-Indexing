<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to the use of a clay and especially of a fabric softening clay 
for control and prevention of fibre damage caused by 
washing and use of fabrics. A typical wash will include some fabric containing 
cellulose based fibres. Abrasion of cellulose based fibres 
under wet conditions results in cotton fibre fibrillation 
whereby the cotton fibres are gradually broken down into 
their component fibrils and into fibrillar sheets. Such 
fibrillation is an important mechanism by which fabrics are 
damaged during wash processes. Alternatively abrasion of 
cellulose fibres occurs when a garment is dry. This 
abrasion or dry wear takes the form of the fibre cracking. The surfaces of damaged fabrics scatter light to a greater 
extent than undamaged fabrics and the scattering causes 
dulling of fabric colours. Ultimately the damage will 
result in mechanical disintegration of the fibre and the 
consequent failure of cotton garments. The main causes of 
fibrillation have been found to be agitation (rubbing) of 
the fibres when wet. Dry friction can also cause fibre 
damage, as the fibre can crack. WO-A-89/04862 relates to a detergent composition for cleaning 
and softening fabrics in which cellulase granulates 
containing calcium carbonate are used in certain 
combinations with a fabric softening clay to wash cotton 
swatches. A composition comprising cellulase and clay is 
said to improve the appearance of the cotton fabric by 
improved colour and anti-pilling performance. These 
improvements are probably due to the action of cellulase on 
cotton which is a cellulosic fibre.  
 GB-A-1400898 relates to the use of certain clays in detergent 
compositions for imparting a softening benefit to fabrics 
washed therewith. (No pilling prevention or control is 
mentioned). EP-A-585040 and EP-A-585039 disclose the use of fabric 
softening compositions containing quaternary ammonium 
compounds for the use as fabric damage inhibitors or 
reducers. EP-A-614966 published on 14 September 1994 discloses the use 
of a fabric softening clay as an additive to reduce or 
prevent wash damage, more specifically loss in weight and 
consequent weakening, of woollen articles in a fabric washing 
composition containing a proteolytic enzyme as well as 
surfactant. EP-A-612841 published 31 August 1994 discloses the use of a 
fabric softening clay on keratin-containing fibres such as 
wool for controlling and for preventing pilling. JP-A-91/0241391 discloses the treatment of synthetic fibre 
textiles to give a pilling
