<ABSTRACT>
A vehicle article carrier having a locking mechanism (46) 
disposed within a bracket member (20). The locking 

mechanism (46) includes 
an actuating member (32) having first and 

second camming surfaces (86,88), a 
locking pin (50) and a clamping member (64). As the 

actuating member (32) is 
moved to an unlocked position, the first camming surface (86) 

cooperates with the locking pin (50) to urge the locking pin out of 
engagement with an aperture (44) in a channel of a support member of 

the vehicle article carrier. Simultaneously, the second camming 
surface (88) causes the clamping member (64) to be moved out of clamping 

engagement with shoulder portions (42) of the channel member. When 
the actuating member (32) is moved from the unlocked to the locked 

position, the first camming surface (86) allows 
a first spring (52) to urge 

the locking pin (50) back into engagement with the aperture (44) in the 
channel member. Simultaneously, the rotation of the actuating 

member (32) causes the second camming surface (88) to allow the clamping 
member (64) to be urged back into clamping engagement in response to 

a biasing force provided by another spring (54). Accordingly, a dual 
locking and unlocking action is provided with movement of a 

single actuating member.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to vehicle article carriers, and more
particularly to a locking mechanism for a bracket member for
adjustably, releasably securing the bracket member and a cross
bar attached thereto at a plurality of locations along a support
member.Vehicle article carriers are used on a wide variety of
vehicles to support and transport cargo and other items, where
such items are either too large to fit in an interior area of the
vehicle or otherwise more conveniently transported on the outside
of the vehicle. In such vehicle article carrier systems, a pair
of support members is typically employed. Each support member
is secured to an outer body vehicle surface such as a roof of the
vehicle and positioned longitudinally along the roof portion of
the vehicle such that each extends from the front of the vehicle
to the rear of the vehicle along outermost side portions of the
vehicle roof. Such systems typically further employ some form
of bracket member which may be slidably, releasably disposed
along each of the support members. The bracket members are
typically secured to a cross bar extending therebetween for
supporting cargo or other like items above the vehicle body roof
or for helping to secure cargo or other like items to the vehicle 
body roof via straps, cords or other like implements. In the
latter case, one or more elongated support strips may be secured
to the vehicle body surface between the support members to
prevent the outer body vehicle surface from becoming scratched,
marred or otherwise damaged by the cargo.For allowing each of the bracket members, and thus the cross
bar, to be positioned at a desired location along the support
members, each bracket member typically includes some form of
locking device for cooperating with the support member to secure
the bracket member releasably at various positions along the
length of each support member. In addition, some form of
actuating means is typically incorporated to enable the locking
device within each bracket member to be released from locking
engagement, to thereby permit adjustment of each bracket member
along its associated support member, and to allow each bracket
member to be locked at a desired position.Patents involving vehicle article carrier systems and
disclosing various forms of novel and non-obvious actuating
mechanisms are disclosed in, for example, U.S. patent numbers
4,684,048, 4,754,905 and 4,972,983, each to John A. Bott.While the vehicle article carrier systems disclosed in the
above-mentioned patents have each
