<ABSTRACT>
A process for removing color from a pulp and paper 
wastewater which comprises the following steps: (a) treating 

the wastewater with a reducing agent which is capable of 
inactivating color producing functional groups of the 

wastewater; and (b) treating the wastewater subsequent to 
step (a) with a polymer which is capable of removing color 

from the wastewater.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention generally relates to a two-step 
process for removing color from pulp and paper wastewater. 
In particular, the process includes the treatment of paper 
mill wastewater with a reducing agent which is capable of 
reacting with color producing functional groups of the 
wastewater, followed by treatment of the wastewater with a 
polymer which is capable of removing color therefrom. Color removal from the effluent streams of paper mills 
continues to be a problem within the pulp and paper 
industry. It is necessary that these downstream wastewaters 
be treated for color removal prior to discharge into public 
waterways. The United States wood pulp production capacity is 
approximately 60 million tons per year. Since the average 
cellulose content of wood is about 40%, 150 million tons of 
wood are needed to produce this 60 million tons of pulp. 
The difference between these two numbers represents the 
lignin and hemicellulose which must be removed or separated  
 
in the pulping process in order to free the cellulose 
fibers. The pulping process, however, does not remove 100% of 
the lignin present in the wood, with approximately 5% 
remaining after either kraft or sulfite pulping (for 
mechanical pulping the amount is considerably higher). If a 
high grade paper is the desired end product, this 5% 
residual lignin must be removed, and is accomplished by 
bleaching the pulp. Since over 35% of the pulp produced in the United 
States is bleached, there are about one million tons of 
lignin removed each year at the bleach plant, and most of 
this in the caustic extraction stage. This number is 
significant because in the removal process (i.e., 
bleaching), most of this residual lignin is solubilized. 
This solubilized lignin is a strong absorber of visible 
radiation resulting from the conjugation of unsaturated and 
quinoidal moieties formed during the oxidation step in the 
bleach plant. Consequently, the bleach plant effluent is 
highly colored. Although there are other sources of color 
in paper mill waste effluent, it is readily apparent that 
where bleaching is performed its effluent can be expected to 
be the major contributor of waste color. Indeed, at kraft, 
bleach mills the effluent from the first caustic extraction 
stage accounts for at least 70% of the waste color.  
 The goal of the pulping and bleaching operations is the 
removal of lignin and hemicellulose from the cellulose fiber 
in the wood. The 95% that is removed by pulping is often 
burned as fuel in the process of

A process for removing color from a pulp and paper wastewater which 
comprises the following steps: 


(a) treating said wastewater with a reducing agent which is capable of inactivating 
at least some of the color producing functional groups of said 

wastewater; wherein said reducing agent is at least one compound selected 
from the group consisting of: sodium bisulfite, sodium hydrosulfite, and sodium 

persulfate and is added to said wastewater in an amount between 50 and 400 
ppm based on weight/weight, and 
(b) treating said wastewater subsequent to step (a) with a polymer which is 
capable of removing color from said wastewater, wherein said polymer is at 

least one polymer and/or copolymer selected from the group consisting of: 
epichlorohydrin-dimethylamine, polyethyleneimines, polydiallyldimethylammonium 

chloride, copolymers of polydiallyldimethylammonium chloride and acrylamide, 
and ethylenedichloride-ammonia, and is added to said wastewater in 

an amount between 25 and 500 ppm as polymer actives based on weight. 
The process according to claim 1 wherein said reducing agent is 
capable of inactivating at least some of said color producing functional groups 

by means of reducing and/or chemically modifying said color producing 
functional groups. 
The process according to claim 1 or 2 wherein said color producing 

functional groups are at least one compound selected from the group consisting 
of: aldehydes and ketenols. 
The process according to any of claims 1 to 3 wherein the pH of said 
wastewater is in the range between 4.0 and 11.0. 
The process according to claim 4 wherein the pH of said wastewater is 
in the range between 6.0 and 8.5. 
The process according to any of claims 1 to 5 wherein said polymer is 
epichlorohydrin-dimethylamine. 
The process according to any of claims 1 to 6 wherein said polymer is 
crosslinked with at least one compound selected from the group consisting of: 

ethylenediamine, ammonia and hexamethylenediamine. 
The process according to any of claims 1 to 7 wherein said wastewater 
is obtained either from the primary or secondary points of a biological waste 

treatment plant or from a primary clarification plant. 
The process according to any of claims 1 to 8 wherein said wastewater 
is alkaline sewer water obtained from a bleach plant which can be treated before 

the waste treatment plant.
