<ABSTRACT>
A foldable boat is described which has a body consisting of a multiplicity of hull surfaces and has at least two hull surfaces whose side edges lie loosely opposite one another in the dismantled state. The invention is distinguished by the fact that a connecting element (bow connector) connects the side edges lying loosely opposite one another to one another in a watertight manner by means of a releasable clamping mechanism.

A foldable boat having a boat body comprising a multiplicity
of hull section segments, said hull section

segments possessing, at least in the bow region, round
lateral edges which can be joined watertight by means

of a detachable joining element, 
characterized by
 the
fact that said joining element is provided with the

following components:

a one-piece designed pick-up rail provided with recesses
for form-fitting pick-up of lateral edges of

two to-be-joined hull section segments,
an attachment aid respectively provided in the region
of said to-be joined lateral edges of said hull section

segments, said attachment aids being joined in
an undetachable manner to each said hull section segment

and designed semi-circular in the direction of
the boat interior and,
at least one holding device provided with two essentially
U-shaped parts, a fixing bracket, which can be

made to engage with the attachment aids, and a force
bracket, which is applied fitting about said fixing

bracket and can pivot about said fixing bracket and
presses said two U-shaped limbs of said force bracket

in the pivoted-in state against said fixing bracket.
A foldable boat according to claim 1,
characterized by
 the fact that said pick-up rail is made
of an elastic material, by way of illustration plastic.
A foldable boat according to claim 1 or 2,
characterized by
 the fact that a holding device fixes
the hull sections inserted on two sides into said pickup

rail against each other inside the boat.
A foldable boat according to one of the claims 1 to
3,
characterized by
 the fact that said U-shaped parts of
said holding device are made of spring steel.
A foldable boat according to one of the claims 1 to
4,
characterized by
 the fact that said fixing bracket and
said force bracket are secured against each other with

a pin.
A foldable boat having a boat body comprising a multiplicity
of hull section segments, said boat body

being composed of bow hull plates, bottom hull plates
and lateral hull plates which can be joined watertight

respectively via straight lateral edges by means of pivotable
joining elements,
characterized by
 the fact that said joining elements
are composed of two molding elements which are each

firmly attached to the lateral edges of two to-be-joined
hull section segments, said molding elements

each being provided with an extension whose cross section
is designed eye-shaped, through which a longitudinal

unit, which simultaneously is the pivoting axis of
said two to-be-joined hull section segments, can be

inserted following respective fitted joining of said
molding elements, and


that said molding elements are provided with regions
into which the molding elements pivoted against each

other come into contact in a watertightening manner
and, in addition, regions are provided which permit the

introduction of additional

sealing material.
A foldable boat according to claim 6,
characterized by
 the fact that said longitudinal unit
is a pin or a wire.
A foldable boat according to claim 6 or 7,
characterized by
 the fact that said molding element of
one of said two opposite side edges is provided with a

section which is essentially perpendicular to said side
edge and which terminates in a respective recess in

said profile element of said other side edge in a precise
fit.
A foldable boat according to one of the claims 6 to
8,
characterized by
 the fact that said bow hull plates are
joined in a pivotable manner via a straight lateral edge

respectively to a bottom hull plate, respectively a
lateral hull plate,


that said bottom hull plates and said lateral hull plates
are joined in a pivotable manner to a straight lateral

edge respectively,
that said bottom hull plates are joined in a pivotable
manner via a straight lateral edge, and
that said foldable boat can be folded in such a manner
that said bow hull plates are pivoted onto said bottom

hull plates respectively said lateral hull plates, said
lateral hull plates are pivoted against said bottom

hull plates and finally said bottom hull plates are pivoted
against each other.
