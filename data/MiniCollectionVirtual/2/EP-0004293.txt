<ABSTRACT>
1. Arrangement of disc thyristors (13, 14, 15, 16) in thermal and electrical contact on heat sinks (10, 11, 12) for use in two- or multi-phase, antiparallel bridge circuits, a plurality of heat sinks (10, 11, 12) being arranged side by side or one above the other in a convertor and one heat sink serving to cool at least two thyristors, characterised in that a heat sink (10, 11, 12) with four disc thyristors (13, 14, 15, 16) is connected to each alternating current power supply (1, 2, 3) and is dimensioned as regards its cooling capacity for the power loss of two disc thyristors and in that the heat sink (10, 11, 12) is contacted by the respective anode side of two thyristors (13, 14) and by the respective cathode side of two thyristors (15, 16).
