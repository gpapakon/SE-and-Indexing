<ABSTRACT>
A dust collector includes a dust collecting chamber (5) 
having an air inlet (6) in one of two ends and an air outlet 

(7) in the other end, a fan (4) for drawing air containing 
dust through the air inlet (6) into the dust collecting 

chamber (5) and for exhausting the air in the dust 
collecting chamber (5) through the air outlet (7) outside 

the dust collecting chamber (5), a sprayer (30) spraying 
water in the dust collecting chamber (5), a partition plate 

(20) mounted in the dust collecting chamber (5) so as to be 
opposed to the air outlet (7) with a predetermined space, 

the partition plate (20) having a closed portion (20a) and 
vent holes (21) annularly disposed around the closed portion 

(20a), the vent holes (21) allowing the air containing dust 
and the sprayed water from the sprayer (30) to pass through 

it, a collision wall (22) annularly disposed around the 
outlet (7) so as to be opposed to the vent holes (21), the 

collision wall (22) catching the dust and the water when the 
air containing dust and the sprayed water having passed 

through the vent holes (21) collide against it such that the 
dust and the
 water are rendered muddy, and discharge 
openings (14, 15) communicating with the dust collecting 

chamber (5) for discharging the mud and the water in the 
collecting chamber (5).

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a dust collector collecting 
air containing dust, in working such as a quarry, and removing 
the dust from the air. A large amount of dust is produced in workings where 
stones and rocks are broken into pieces or where gravel or 
sand is dealt with. A dust collector is provided in these 
workings for collecting air containing dust and removing the 
dust from the air. One of such conventional dust collectors 
comprises a bag filter disposed in a casing and a fan. Air 
containing dust is drawn into the casing through a duct by 
the blowing action of the fan. The air is then drawn 
through meshes of the bag filter such that only the dust is 
caught by the bag filter. Since the dust caught by the bag 
filter sometimes clogs or closes its meshes, the bag filter 
is oscillated periodically or successively so that the 
meshes are prevented from being clogged by the dust. Other conventional dust collectors also employ filters 
such as the above-described bag filter. However, the 
filters necessitate means for removing the dust, which means 
complicates the construction of the dust collector. 
Furthermore, the filter needs to be periodically inspected 
and to be replaced by a new one so that the dust collector is 
maintained at a predetermined level of dust collecting 
performance. Thus, the inspection and replacement of the 
filter is troublesome and results in an increase of maintenance 
fees.  
 Yet another conventional means for cleaning air is described in 
EP-A-0 337 940, where air laden with impurites passes through a 
wall with passages in it, and over which wall a liquid film is 
passed. The resultant mixture of contaminated air and liquid 
impinges on baffle means positioned at each passage outlet from 
the wall, where the abrupt change of direction causes the impurities 
to be captured by the liquid and to drop with the liquid 
into a collection tank.  
 Therefore, an object of the present invention is to 
provide a dust collector wherein the dust can be removed 
from the air without the filter for the dust collection and 
the inspection can be performed readily. The invention provides a dust collector comprising 
by a dust collecting chamber having an air inlet in one of 
two ends and an air outlet in the other end, a fan provided 
for drawing air containing dust through the air inlet into 
the dust collecting chamber and for exhausting the air in 
the dust collecting chamber through the air outlet outside 
the dust collecting chamber, a sprayer spraying water in the 
dust

<CLAIMS>
A dust collector comprising: 

a) a dust collecting chamber (5) having an air inlet 
(6) in one of two ends and an air outlet (7) in the other 

end; 
b) a fan (4) provided for drawing air containing dust 
through the air inlet (6) into the dust collecting chamber 

(5) and for exhausting the air in the dust collecting 
chamber (5) through the air outlet (7) outside the dust 

collecting chamber (5); 
c) a sprayer (30) spraying water in the dust collecting 
chamber (5); 
d) a partition plate (20) mounted in the dust 
collecting chamber (5) so as to be opposed to the air outlet 

(7) with a predetermined space therebetween, the partition 
plate (20) having a closed portion (20a) where the same is 

opposed to the air outlet (7) and a plurality of vent holes
