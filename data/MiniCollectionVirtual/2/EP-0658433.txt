<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a sheet
feeding apparatus incorporated into a recording
apparatus such as a facsimile machine, a copying
machine, a printer and the like, and more particularly,
it relates to a sheet feeding apparatus for
separating and supplying sheets one by one.Conventionally, in recording apparatuses such
as a printers, copying machines, facsimile machines
and the like, a thick sheet such as a post card, an
envelope and the like, or a special sheet such as a
plastic film has been used as a recording sheet, as
well as a normal sheet. The recording sheet is
supplied by manually inserting the sheet one by one
or by feeding the sheets automatically and
continuously one by one by means of an automatic
sheet feeding apparatus (ADF).An example of an automatic sheet feeding
apparatus incorporated into a recording apparatus
is shown in Figs. 32A to 32E. The recording apparatus
51 includes an automatic sheet feeding apparatus 52
for separating and supplying sheets P one by one, and
a recording portion 53 for recording image information 
on the supplied sheet.As shown in Fig. 32A, the recording sheets P
rested on a pressure plate 54 are urged against rollers
57 arranged in coaxial with a sheet supply roller 56
by means of compression springs 55, and separation
pawls 58 are arranged at front corners of the pressure
plate 54. As shown in Fig. 32B, the recording sheets
P fed out by rotation of the sheet supply roller 56
are separated one by one by the separation pawls 58,
and the separated sheet is guided by a guide portion
59 to be fed between a convey roller 60 and a pinch
roller 61 by a predetermined amount, as shown in Fig.
32C. Thereafter, the convey roller 60 is rotated
reversely to try to return the recording sheet P. In
this case, the sheet supply roller 56 is being stopped
while contacting the recording sheet P, so that, due
to resiliency of the recording sheet returned by the
convey roller 60, the sheet supply roller is subjected
to a force for rotating the sheet supply roller in a
direction opposite to a sheet feeding direction.
However, since the reverse rotation of the sheet
supply roller 56 is prevented by means of a reverse
rotation preventing mechanism such as a one-way
clutch (not shown), the recording sheet P is prevented
from returning.As a result, a tip end of the recording sheet
P reaches to a nip between the convey roller 60 and 
the pinch roller 61, and, as shown in Fig. 32D, a loop
is formed in the recording sheet P between the convey
roller 60 and the sheet supply roller
