<ABSTRACT>
A rotor (39) mounted rotatably in a rotor housing (38) and belonging to an axial separating device (24) is provided in its reception region with guide plates (52) or an initial plate (60) which have a recess and which prevent the crop from executing an axial movement out of the reception region of the rotor (39).

<CLAIMS>
An axial separating device with a rotor housing (38) and a rotor (39) rotatably mounted therein,
with at least one helical guide vane (52) on a rotor drum (44), characterized in that in the

receiving region of the rotor (39) there are provided a recess in the region of the radially outer
upper edge (67) of the guide vane (52) and a leading blade (60) upstream of the guide vane (52)

and extending transverse to the axis of rotation of the rotor (39).
An axial separating device according to claim 1, characterized in that the start of the guide vane
(52) runs obliquely
 from radially inside to outside.
An axial separating device according to claim 1 or 2, characterized in that a recess is formed
between the leading blade (60) and the upstream end of the guide vane (52).
An axial separating device according to one or more of the preceding claims, characterized in thht
the leading blade (60) extends obliquely outwards from a point (62) of smaller height up to a base

edge (64) of greater height, as regarded in the direction of rotation of the rotor (39).
An axial separating device according to claim 4, characterized in that the guide vane (52) engages
and is especially welded on the leading blade (60) between its point (62) and its base edge (64).
An axial separating device according to claims 2 and 5, characterized in that the upper edge (67)
of the guide vane (52) engages the leading blade (60) below the upper edge thereof.
