<ABSTRACT>
A method for the surface treatment of an absorbent 
resin is proposed which notably improves the absorption 

capacity of the absorbent resin under pressure without 
impairing safety and hydroscopic flowability. The method 

comprises adding an organic carboxylic ester of a polyhydric 
alcohol to the absorbent resin and then heat-treating the 

resultant mixture.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a method for the surface
treatment of an absorbent resin. More particularly, it
relates to a method for the surface treatment of an
absorbent resin, which method is ideal for the production of
an absorbent agent exhibiting excellent physical properties
such as a high capacity for absorption under load, excels in
safety, and hydroscopic flowability.In recent years, absorbent resins which absorb a
large volume of water and consequently take on the form of
gel have been developed and have been finding extensive
utility in the field of agriculture and forestry and the
field of civil engineering as well as in the field of
sanitary materials such as disposable diapers and sanitary
napkins.The absorbent resins heretofore known in the art
include cross-linked polyacrylic salts, hydrolyzed starch-acrylonitrile
graft polymer, starch-acrylic acid (acrylic
salt) graft polymer, saponified cross-linked vinyl acetateacrylate
copolymers, cross-linked polyacrylamide, cross-linked
polymer of 2-acrylamide-2-methyl propanesulfonic acid
(propanesulfonic salt), hydrolyzed cross-linked
polyacrylamide, and cross-linked cationic monomers, for
example.These absorbent resins are insolubilized hydrophilic
resins which have a uniform cross-linked structure in their
polymeric units. Generally, the particles of these
absorbent resins have their surfaces additionally cross-linked
as with a cross-linking agent to impart a cross-link
density gradient to the particles and enable the absorbent
resins to acquire improved physical properties as evinced by
addition to the absorption rate of water, preclusion of the 
formation of wet clusters of particulate resin, exaltation
of gel strength, improvement in the absorption capacity of
water under load, prevention of the phenomenon of gel
blocking, and enhancement of the liquid permeability. In
the case of the absorbent resins which have such functional
groups as, for example, a carboxyl group or a hydroxyl
group, since the surface treatment mentioned above affects
the basic physical properties of the absorbent resins to a
large extent, numerous cross-linking agents and many methods
for their mixing have been proposed to date.The methods heretofore proposed for the mixing of
cross-linking agents are broadly divided into those
comprising dispersing an absorbent resin in a solvent (JP-A-56-131,608,
JP-A-57-44,627, JP-A-58-42,602, and JP-A-58-117,222)
and those comprising directly adding a treating
agent or a solution of the treating agent to an absorbent
resin. In the
