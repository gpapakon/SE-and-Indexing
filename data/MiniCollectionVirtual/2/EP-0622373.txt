<DESCRIPTION>
This invention provides acids, esters, and salts of bisphosphonic acids and 1,2-oxaphosphepins 
which are useful as antiinflammatory and anti-arthritic agents. Among the various phosphonate derivatives known in the art are the bisphosphonates 
(previously known as diphosphonates) which are structurally characterized by two C-P bonds. 
The simplest bisphosphonate, 1,1-(methylene)-bisphosphonate or geminal bisphosphonate (gem-bisphosphonate), 
is a carbon surrogate of pyrophosphate. In general, it is believed that the 
mode of action of the bisphosphonates in vivo is analogous to the complexing ability of 
pyrophosphate. However, the correspondence between complexing ability and spatial 
relationships of the phosphonic acids has received less attention. In general, the complexing 
capabilities, the inhibition of crystal growth in vitro, and tissue calcification effects in vivo are 
considered to decline with increasing separation of the phosphonate groups. See H. Fleisch, 
Bone 8, (1987) Suppl. 1, S 23; X. Lu et al., Synthesis, (1989) 848, and G. Sturtz et al., J. 
Chem. Res. (S), (1978) 89. The 1,1 class of bisphosphonates have demonstrated considerable utility in the 
regulation of calcification in both industrial and domestic water installations as well as in 
certain human diseases. Various 1,1-bisphosphonic acids have been demonstrated to inhibit the 
inflammation/arthritic process in the rat adjuvant arthritis model. These include 
hydroxyethylidine diphosphonate, dichloromethylene diphosphonate, aminopropylidine 
diphosphonate, 4-chlorophenylthiomethylene bisphosphonic acid (also known as SR 41319) and 
2-(3-pyridinyl) ethylidinehydroxy diphosphonic acid (also known as NE 58095). A. Barbier et 
al., IUPHAR, 9th Int. Cong. of Pharmacology, London, (1984) Abstract 131, have shown that 
SR 41319 inhibits hydroxyapatite crystal deposition in arthritic rats. However, R. Roncucci et 
al., Proc. Third Int. Cong. Inflam., Paris (1984) and X. Edmonds-Alt et al., Biochem. 
Pharmacol., (1985) 34, 4043, report that a singular mechanism for its anti-arthritic action is 
unlikely as cellular and immunological events are also inhibited by the drug. The foregoing 
studies involve the 1,1-bisphosphonic acids or their salts as do cellular studies and most 
biochemical studies. A selective utility of 1,1-bisphosphonate esters has been reported by L.M. 
Nguyen et al., J. Med. Chem., (1987) 30, 1426 with the induction of high density lipoproteins 
and HDL cholesterol in vivo by geminal bisphosphonate esters but not by
