<ABSTRACT>
A lens for slidable adapting on a guide rod has a lens assembly means; and 
a permanent magnetic assembly means connected to the lens assembly, having a 

permanent magnet for applying a close-coupled magnetic force on the guide rod to 
hold the lens assembly means at a desired position along the guide rod. The 

permanent magnetic is V-shaped with a north pole, a south pole, and a recessed 
longitudinal channel in-between for receiving the guide rod in close proximity, and 

has a plurality of rotational guide bearing means, each rolling against an underside 
of the guide rod to guide the lens assembly as it is moved along the guide rod. 

The lens assembly means also has an aperture therein in which the guide rod 
passes through to secure the lens assembly from releasing from the guide rod 

when shock loading exceeds the closed-coupled magnetic attraction force.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention generally relates to a lens which is movably
positioned along a guide rod, and in particular relates to a movably positioned lens
having magnetic means for holding it in place on the guide rod.Conventional guidance assemblies for optical or mechanical devices include
guide rods and re-circulating linear ball bearings which must be heavily pre-loaded
to provide precision play-free guidance. This results in high cost, requires high
accuracy between mating parts, and includes relatively bulky components.Further, relatively high drive forces are typically needed to move the pre-loaded
components. Such pre-loads are susceptible to change with temperature.In one typical use, a guidance assembly supports a lens for filming motion
pictures which requires exceptionally accurate positioning to ensure very sharp
images to film a master tape (from which all future tapes will be copied). The
filming of a motion picture may subject the guidance assembly to extreme
temperature variations, such as those in a desert or mountainous climate. The
extreme temperature variations may cause difficulty in positioning the lens
assembly and may cause movement due to expansion and contraction in a pre-positioned
lens assembly. The invention provides a lens assembly according to claim 1.In an embodiment, the permanent magnetic assembly has an
aperture therein through which the guide rod passes to protect the lens assembly
from falling off the guide rod when shock loading may exceed the closed-coupled
magnetic attraction force.The invention provides accurate guidance to moving mechanical assemblies
(e.g. moving elements in a zoom lens) while maintaining low resistance to the
drive forces in the direction of motion.The invention provides a reliable and accurate guidance under extreme
temperature variations by employing permanent magnetic attraction unchanged by
lubricants or other physical conditions.The invention applies to electronic zoom lens. It also applies to any opto-mechanical,
electro-mechanical or like devices where reliable athermal guidance is
needed. Other objects and advantages of the present invention will become apparent
to those skilled in the art from the following detailed description of the invention
when read in conjunction with the appended claims and drawing attached hereto.Figure 1, not drawn to scale, shows a movable lens arranged on guide rods
according to the present invention.Figure 2, not drawn to scale, shows a cross-sectional view of the guide rod
and the permanent magnetic

<CLAIMS>
A lens assembly (2) for slidably positioning a lens along a guide rod (4), comprising:

a lens cell assembly (10); and
a permanent magnetic assembly (12) connected to the lens cell assembly (10),
having a permanent magnet (20) arranged to be juxtaposed in close spatial relationship to the guide rod

(4) with minimum clearance (41) between guide rod (4) and magnet assembly (12) for applying a close-coupled magnetic force on the guide rod (4) to hold the lens cell
assembly (10) at a desired position along the guide rod (4), and

having a plurality of rotational guide bearings (22, 24, 26, 28), each guiding the lens assembly (2) as it is moved along the guide rod (4).
A lens assembly (2) according to claim 1, wherein the permanent magnet has a north
pole (40) and a south pole (42) arranged to be disposed adjacent the guide rod (4) and spaced apart from one

another.
A lens assembly (2) according to claim 2, wherein the permanent magnet (20) is U-shaped.
A lens assembly (2) according to claim 2, the north (40) and south (42) poles form a
longitudinal channel (44) arranged to correspond to the shape of the guide rod (4) for providing

maximum attraction forces with minimum clearance (41) between guide rod (4) and magnet
assembly (12) supporting the lens cell assembly (10) on the guide rod (4) through four rolling

elements (22, 24, 26, 28).
A lens assembly (2) according to claim 2, wherein the north (40) and south (42) poles form a
longitudinal channel (44) which is V-shaped. 
A lens assembly (2) according to claim 2, wherein the north pole (40) and south pole (42)
are arranged to attract the guide rod (4) at an arc segment of about 60°.
A lens assembly (2) according to claim 1, wherein the permanent magnetic assembly (12)
has a plurality of rotational guide bearings (22, 24, 26, 28), each being arranged to be disposed adjacent the guide

rod (4) and to support it to guide the lens assembly (2) along the guide rod (4).

contact the guide rod (4) at an arc segment of about 120° with respect to the

horizontal plane H of the guide rod (4).
A lens assembly (2) according to claim 1, wherein the permanent magnet assembly (12) has a
longitudinal clearance aperture (30) for the guide

rod (4) to pass through for preventing the lens assembly (2) from breaking if the
permanent magnet (20) releases from the guide rod (4) in the event of shock loading that

may exceed the closed-coupled magnetic force.
