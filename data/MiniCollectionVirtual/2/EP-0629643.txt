An aqueous dispersed, low VOC coating containing a 
polymeric binder comprises an addition copolymer grafted 

epoxy-polyester terpolymer. The graft terpolymer comprises 
by weight between 1% and 70% unsaturated polyester, 5% and 

80% epoxy resin, and 5% and 70% addition copolymer, where 
the terpolymer has an Acid Number above about 30 and is 

dispersed into water with a volatile base.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to aqueous coating compositions 
comprising dispersed acrylic grafted epoxy and polyester 
interpolymers particularly useful for can coatings for 
beverages and foods. It also relates to a process for 
making the compositions, to a coating process using them 
and to a coated substrate obtainable by the coating 
process. Industrial coatings are surface protective coatings (paint 
coatings) applied to substrates and typically heat cured to 
form continuous films for decorative purposes as well as to 
protect the substrate. A protective coating ordinarily 
comprises an organic polymeric binder, pigments, and 
various paint additives, where the polymeric binder acts as 
a fluid vehicle for the pigments and imparts rheological 
properties to the fluid paint coating. Upon curing, the 
polymeric binder hardens and functions as a binder for the 
pigments and provides adhesion of the dried paint film to 
the substrate. The pigments may be organic or inorganic 
and functionally contribute to opacity and colour in 
addition to durability and hardness, although some paint 
coatings contain little or no opacifying pigments and are 
described as clear coatings. The manufacture of paint 
coatings involves the preparation of a polymeric binder, 
mixing of component materials, grinding of pigments in the  
 
polymeric binder, and thinning to commercial standards. 
Epoxy resins are particularly desirable for use in 
protective surface coating materials as a vehicle or 
polymeric binder for pigments, fillers, and other additives 
wherein epoxy resins advantageously provide toughness, 
flexibility, adhesion, and chemical resistance. Water-dispersed 
coating compositions containing epoxy resins are 
highly desirable for can coating compositions. They are 
often used in coatings for soft drink and beer cans, for 
example, where it is critical that the coating does not 
alter the taste of the beverage inside the can. Taste 
problems can occur in a variety of ways such as by leaching 
of coating components into the beverage, or by adsorption 
of flavour by the coating, or sometimes by chemical 
reaction, or by some combination thereof. Can coating technology frequently utilizes an epoxy resin 
which has been grafted with acrylic monomers, styrene, and 
methacrylic acid. This grafted epoxy resin is prepared in 
solvent, usually butyl cellosolve, and n-butanol, to 
maintain low processing viscosities and then reduced with 
water by a direct or inverse let down procedure. Although 
cured film properties are
