<ABSTRACT>
The temperature of the vinyl chloride polymerisation medium with the use of oil-soluble initiators is regulated essentially by direct and modulated injection of an effective quantity of a strong inorganic inhibitor of the radical polymerisation or of a precursor, which are advantageously chosen from iodine and nitrogen monoxide, and from alkali metal iodides and nitrites, precursors of iodine and of nitrogen monoxide respectively. The process results in a significant improvement in the production efficiency of the reactors.
