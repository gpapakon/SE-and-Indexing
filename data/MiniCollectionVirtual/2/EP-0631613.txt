<DESCRIPTION>
 NEUTRAL pH FREEZER BAR AND PROCESSTECHNICAL FIEIP This invention relates to carboxylic acid based freezer cleansing bars and a process for making same.BACKGROUND U.S. Pat. No. 3,835,058, White, issued Sept. 10, 1974, incorporated herein by reference discloses a freezer bar composition and process.Neutral pH bars, per se, are known. Prior art neutral pH bars do not include substantial levels of hygroscopic materials, soft solids, and liquids, including water, without becoming soft or sticky with poor smears. Firm, low smear, neutral pH cleansing bars as defined herein, are believed to be novel and unobvious.The pH of healthy human skin is from about 4.8 to about 6. "Weakly acidic" means a pH of from about 4.8 to about 6 which is distinguished from a neutral or alkaline pH. A personal cleansing freezer bar having the three-dimensional structure is disclosed in coαnonly assigned, copending U.S. Pat. Application Ser. No. 07/731,163, Taneri/Kacher et al., filed July 15, 1991. The formation of a shaped, solid, three-dimensional skeleton (core) structure is described in commonly assigned, copending U.S. Pat. Application Ser. No. 07/617,827, Kacher/Taneri/Camden/Vest/Bowles, filed Nov. 26, 1990. Kacher et al. does not specifically teach neutral pH freezer bars. These commonly assigned patent applications do not teach neutral pH freezer bars. Commercial neutral pH bars, e.g., DOVE*, CARESS*, and 0LAYβ, usually contain only a maximum of about 5% moisture. Such prior art neutral pH bars are soft or have relatively poor smears. 

Prior art neutral pH bars containing substantial levels of hygro¬ scopic materials, soft solids, or liquids, including water, are soft or sticky with poor smears.Cleansing bars, per se, with reduced bar smear are reported in the art. E.g., U.S. Pat. No. 2,988,511, Hills, issued June 13, 1961, incorporated herein by reference, discloses a low smearing bar.Bar smear, also referred to as bar sloth, is the soft solid or mush that forms at the surface of a bar when submerged in water and is regarded by consumers as messy, unattractive, and uneco¬ nomical.High moisture and low smear personal cleansing bars are disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 4,606,839 Harding, issued Aug. 19, 1986. Harding uses coconut and/or palm kernel oil soap. However, an examination of a used personal cleansing bars in today's average bathroom will show that there is still a need to improve cleansing bar smear.Bar smear is especially poor in neutral pH bar formulations which contain higher levels (50% ±10%) of synthetic
