<ABSTRACT>
The invention concerns a seal housing for a mechanical seal device. 
The latter is arranged within a cavity (6) provided with a spiral 
notch (11) at its mantle surface for feeding particles in the liquid 

in a direction away from the seal means (7).

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention concerns a seal housing for a seal device, such as a
mechanical face seal, arranged between the hydraulic part and the
driving motor in a pump of the centrifugal type.A conventional centrifugal pump comprises a driving unit, such as an
electric motor and a pump housing connected via a driving shaft. In
order to prevent the pumped medium from entering the electric motor
via the shaft and cause damage, some sort of seal is arranged between
the pump housing and the motor. A common seal is the so-called mechanical
face seal which consists of a rotary and a stationary seal ring
which are pressed towards each other by spring force.A seal of this type is very effective as long as the two seal surfaces
are even and undamaged. In order to secure a perfect sealing
there is often used an arrangement consisting of two mechanical seals
and an intermediate oil room. In this way one of the seals will
always be lubricated and cooled by clean oil and the risk for damages
is decreased.The seal adjacent the pump housing, here called the lower
seal, will however always be exposed to the pumped medium and damages
can easily occur if the medium contains wearing particles. This is
very common in mines and certain other industrial areas.The lower seal is normally mounted in a cavity which has a cylindrical
or conical form. If conical, the part with the longer diameter
is heading the pump housing. This form has manufacturing reasons, but
it is also based on the theory that particles that enter the cavity
shall be thrown out again by centrifugal force. It turns out however,
that pollutants are concentrated at the inner part of the cavity,
where they may damage the seal surfaces as well as the cavity walls.
This phenomenon also occurs in seal housings where the cavity has a
cylinder formed shape.The concentration of pollutants depends on the fact that rotation of 
the pumped medium generates secondary flows of such a nature that
rotating surfaces obtain a radially outwards directed flow, while
stationary surfaces obtain a radially inwards directed flow which is
superposed the tangentially directed flow. Particles within the seal
housing will be thrown outwards to the cylindrical or conical surface
by centrifugal force, the boundary layer flow along that surface then
directing particles within the seal housing towards the seal. The
particles are not transported back to the pump impeller at the outlet
of the seal housing as the backwards directed flow is weaker than the
inwards directed flow and because of the fact

<CLAIMS>
A device in a seal housing of a rotary machine such as a pump or a mixer for
liquids, which device comprises a driving motor (1) a hydraulic part (2) with a rotary impeller

(3) or propeller connected to the motor via a shaft (4) and a seal housing (5) between
the motor and the hydraulic part, said housing containing at least one seal such as a

mechanical face seal, arranged within a cavity (6) in the seal housing, said cavity
being open towards the pump impeller (3) and having a mantle surface (12) which is

provided with at least one internal notch or shoulder (11), characterized in that said
mantle surface (12) and said shaft (4) with attached seal are widely parted in the

radial direction in such a way that an annular open space is created between them
and that said notch or shoulder (11), which goes along a part of the circumference or

makes several turns around the latter in an essentially spiral or helix pattern, has
such a winding direction, that the part of the liquid present near the mantle surface

(12) is fed in the direction of the pump impeller (3) by the rotary movement that the
liquid obtains when the shaft (4) rotates.
A device according to claim 1, characterized in that the cavity (6) has an
increasing area in the direction of the pump impeller (3).
A device according to claim 1, characterized in that the cavity (6) has an
unchanged or decreasing area in the direction of the pump impeller (3)
A device according to claim 1, characterized in that the cavity (6) has a plane
mantle surface and that the notch or shoulder (11) is formed as an insert part (13).
