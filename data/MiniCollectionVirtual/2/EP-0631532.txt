<DESCRIPTION>
This invention pertains to abrasive articles comprising a cured 
modified thermosetting binder. In the case of a bonded abrasive, the cured 
modified thermosetting binder bonds abrasive grains together to form a shaped 
mass. In the case of a coated abrasive, the cured modified thermosetting binder 
holds and supports the abrasive grains on a backing sheet. In the case of a 
nonwoven abrasive, the cured modified thermosetting binder holds and supports 
the abrasive grains in a fibrous sheet. Coated abrasives, which are a type of abrasive article, comprise 
a backing upon which a binder holds and supports a coating of abrasive grains. 
A typical coated abrasive comprises a "make" coat of a thermosetting resinous 
binder applied on the front surface of the backing in order to secure the 
abrasive grains to the backing, and a "size" coat of a thermosetting binder 
which can be applied over the make coat and abrasive grains in order to firmly 
bond the abrasive grains to the backing. The binder material of the size coat 
can be the same material as the binder material of the make coat or of a 
different material. Examples of typical make and size coats include phenolic 
resins, urea-formaldehyde resins, urethane resins, melamine-formaldehyde 
resins, epoxy resins and alkyd resins. The most widely used binder is a resole 
phenolic resin. Examples of common coated abrasive backings include cloth, 
polymeric film, paper, vulcanized fiber, nonwoven webs and combinations and 
treated versions thereof. If the backing is cloth, the cloth is usually sealed, 
otherwise the make coat will penetrate into the cloth. The cloth is scaled or 
treated by applying one or more coats of an adhesive type material. Examples 
of typical treating adhesives include lattices, styrene-butadiene copolymers, 
glue, starches, phenolic resins, urea-formaldehyde resins, urethane resins, 
melamine-formaldehyde resins, epoxy resins and alkyd resins. Bonded 
abrasives which are a type of abrasive article, comprise abrasive grains bonded 
together by a binder to form a shaped mass. Nonwoven abrasives, which are a 
type of abrasive article comprise abrasive grains bonded to a nonwoven 
substrate.  
 In recent years, there has been an increasing demand for 
superabrasives both in the coated and bonded abrasive markets. Superabrasives 
are abrasive articles that employ abrasive grains that are superior in 
performance, i.e., greater than 20 times that of conventional abrasive grains in 
abrading difficult to grind materials such as tool steels
