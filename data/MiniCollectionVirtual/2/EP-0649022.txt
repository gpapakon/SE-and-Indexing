<ABSTRACT>
An optical indicator for determining the activity of an ion in a sample has an ionophor which is capable of selectively binding the ion to be measured. Furthermore, the ionophore has at least two functional groups which can bind an electron-donor-acceptor (EDA) complex, the complex binding being broken by reception of the ion to be measured. As a result of this, at least one of the measurable optical properties of the indicator changes as a function of the activity of the ion to be measured.

Optical indicator for determination of the activity of an
ion in a sample, the sample being at least in indirect contact

with the indicator, and the indicator having an ionophore and
at least two functional groups forming an electron-donor-acceptor

(EDA) complex, whose conformation will change as the
ion to be measured is bound by the ionophore and the EDA

complex is broken up during this process, sucn that at least
one of the optical properties of the indicator will undergo a

measurable change, 
characterized in that
 the functional groups
are attached to the ionophore, and the following ionophores are

used to determine the activity of the following ions:

Optical indicator as claimed in Claim 1, 
characterized in
that
 both functional groups of the ionophore consist of an
aromatic hydrocarbon with at least one substituent each, the at

least one substituent of one functional group being an electron
donor and the at least one substituent of the other functional

group being an electron acceptor. 
Optical indicator as claimed in Claim 1, 
characterized in
that
 one functional group of the ionophore has an aromatic
hydrocarbon, whose at least one substituent is an electron

donor, and that the other functional group of the ionophore is
an atom from the group of chlorine, bromine, iodine.
Optical indicator as claimed in any of Claims 2 to 3,

characterized in that
 at least one functional group of the
ionophore has a fluorophore.
Optical indicator as claimed in any of Claims 1 to 4,

characterized in that
 the distance of the two functional groups
in the backbone of the ionophore is at least four and at most

eight intermediate atoms.
