<ABSTRACT>
A substrate (1) including a plurality of electrically conducting vias (51) has 
electrical conductors (52, 53) disposed on its surfaces interconnecting 

pairs of the vias (51). The vias (51) and the electrical conductors (52, 53) 
form a first helical
 winding (47). Electrically insulating films (41, 42) disposed 
on opposite sides of the substrate (41) include further vias penetrating 

the insulating films and the substrate. These vias are interconnected in 
pairs to form a second helical winding (48) that at least partially surrounds 

the first winding (47) and is inductively coupled to the first helical winding 
(47). A relatively large mutual inductance between the two helical windings 

(47, 48) in a relatively small volume is achieved.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method for producing a transformer as
described in claim 1.From US 4,071,378 a transformer of the kind mentioned above and a method
for producing thereof are already known according to which the following
process steps are carried out: Forming a plurality of droplets of a selective
metal on a selective portion of a major surface area of a body of semiconductor
material having two major opposed surfaces; establishing a
thermal gradient substantially along an axis of the body perpendicular to
the two major opposed surfaces; thermal migrating the plurality of droplets
of selective metal through the body in the direction of the higher temperature
of the thermal gradient from the one major surface to the, and terminating
in, the other ofthe two major opposed surfaces to form a plurality
of regions of recrystallized material of the body each having two opposed
end surfaces, each end surface being coextensive with only one of the two
major surfaces, solid solubility of the selective metal therein and a second
and opposite type conductivity than the body and also forming a P-N junction
at the contiguous surfaces of each ofthe regions and the body; affixing
electrical contact means to selective end surfaces of selective regions to
form a series circuit thereof to function as a primary winding of a transformer;
and affixing electrical contact means to selective end surfaces of
the remainder ofthe regions to form a series circuit thereof to function as a
secondary winding of the same transformer. The electrical contact means
for the primary winding are deposited on layers of electrically insulating
material disposed on the respective surfaces of the semiconductor body,
whereas the electrical contact means for the secondary windings are
formed on electrical insulating layers disposed on the respective layers
mentioned above. US 3 881 244 discloses a solid state inductor formed in a monocristalline
semiconductor body. The inductor comprises an electrically insulated helix
having metallic vias disposed in corresponding via holes and electrical
conductors disposed on an insulating film covering the semiconductor body.
Each of these conductors electrically connects respective pairs of vias.It is an object of the present invention to provide a suitable method for producing
a transformer integrable in a semiconductor integrated circuit that
has a relatively high mutual inductance between its windings while occupying
a relatively small area and volume.This object is solved by the method

using an electrically insulating substrate (1) which includes a plurality
of first via holes that penetrate said substrate (1) from a first surface

(43) to a second surface (44) thereof;
filling said first via holes with an electrically conducting material in
order to obtain electrically conducting first vias (51);
electrically connecting pairs of the first vias (51) by electrical conductors
(53) disposed on the first surface (43) of said substrate (1) as well as

pairs of the first vias (51) by electrical conductors (52) disposed on the second
surface (44) of said substrate (1) in order to obtain a first generally helical

coil (47);
connecting two of the first vias (51) to respective leads (54) disposed
on the second surface (44) of said substrate (1);
placing electrically insulating layers (41, 42) on the first and second
surfaces (43, 44) of the substrate (1), respectively;
producing second via holes penetrating the insulating layers (41, 42)
as well as the substrate (1);
filling said second via holes with an electrically conducting material
in order to obtain electrically conducting second vias (56);
interconnecting by electrical conductors (58) pairs of the second vias
(56) exposed at the outer surface (45) of the first insulating layer (41), and

interconnecting by electrical conductors (57) pairs of the second vias (56)
exposed at the outer surface (46) of the second electrically insulating layer

(42) in order to obtain a second generally helical coil (48); and
disposing two electrical leads (58a) on the outer surface (46) of the
second insulating layer (42) respectively in contact with one of the second

vias (56) to produce external leads.
