<ABSTRACT>
3-Aminomethyl-3,5,5-trimethylcyclohexylamine (isophoronediamine) is a raw material which is used industrially for various synthetic resins. Isophoronediamine is used as a cis/trans isomer mixture, the cis/trans isomer ratio influencing the properties. The invention shows a way of controlling the isomer ratio in the preparation of isophoronediamine by aminating hydrogenation of 3-cyano-3,5,5-trimethylcyclohexanone (isophoronenitrile) in the presence of ammonia, H2 and a catalyst. The reaction is carried out in two temperature stages, namely first at 10 to 90 DEG C and then at 90 to 150 DEG C with a temperature difference between both stages of at least 30 DEG C, the contact time in the first stage being shorter than in the second. By lowering the temperature in the first stage the cis/trans ratio is increased.

Process for influencing the proportion of cis-/trans 
isomers of 3-aminomethyl-3,5,5-trimethylcyclohexylamine 

(isophoronediamine; IPDA) 
during the preparation thereof from 3-cyano-3,5,5-trimethylcyclohexanone 

(isophorone nitrile, IPN) by 
aminating hydrogenation, wherein isophorone nitrile is 

reacted with hydrogen at a pressure of from 3 to 
20 MPa and a temperature of up to 150°C in the 

presence of ammonia and of a suspension hydrogenation 
catalyst or fixed-bed hydrogenation catalyst selected 

from cobalt, nickel and precious metal catalysts and 
the reaction mixture obtained is worked up by 

distillation,
 
characterised in that the hydrogenation is carried out 

in a first step at 10°C to 90°C and in a subsequent 
second step at above 90°C up to 150°C, the temperature 

difference between the first and second step being at 
least 30°C, with the contact time when a suspension 

catalyst is used being from 5 to 30 minutes in the 
first step and from 30 to 200 minutes in the second 

step and the LHSV value when a fixed-bed catalyst is 
used being from 2 to 12 h
-1
 in the first step and from 
0.3 to 2 h
-1
 in the second step. 
Process according to claim 1,
 
characterised in that the aminating hydrogenation is 

carried out in the presence of an organic solvent 
selected from among the C
1
 to C
4
 alcohols, cyclic 
ethers and ethylene glycol monomethyl ether or 

ethylene glycol dimethyl ether or corresponding ethyl 
ethers and preferably methanol. 
Process according to claim 1 or 2,
 
characterised in that hydrogenation is carried out in 

the first step at 20°C to 80°C and in the second step 
at 100°C to 140°C.  

 
Process according to one or more of claims 1 to 3,
 
characterised in that the aminating hydrogenation is 

carried out using one or more fixed-bed catalysts 
under trickle-bed conditions, with the temperature of 

the first step being maintained in a first catalyst 
bed and the temperature of the second step being 

maintained in a second catalyst bed. 
Process according to claim 4,
 
characterised in that a mixture containing from 10 to 

40 wt.% of isophorone nitrile, from 10 to 40 wt.% of 
ammonia and methanol as solvent is applied to the 

first catalyst bed and the reaction mixture, after 
trickling through, is caused to trickle through the 

first and second catalyst bed arranged in a single 
trickle-bed reactor or in two trickle-bed reactors, 

hydrogenation being carried out at a pressure of from 
5 to 8 MPa and at a temperature of from 10°C to 80°C in 

the first step and at 100°C up to 130°C in the second 
step. 
Process according to claim 4 or 5,
