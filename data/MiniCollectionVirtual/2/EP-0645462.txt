<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a method for optimizing the residual stress distribution in spring elements used as vehicle suspension springs, especially in the bar cross-section of helical compression springs of relatively high strength, the helical compression springs being set and shot-peened. To provide such a method which allows a further improvement in the life, in particular, of helical compression springs with strengths of Rm

/= 1800 N/mm
<

, the helical compression springs are fed to the production steps of setting and shot-peening with a predetermined strength profile related to the bar cross-section.

<CLAIMS>
Method for optimizing the inherent stress distribution in the bar cross-section of
helical compression springs having a strength greater than 1800 N/mm
2
, which serve
as motor vehicle bearing springs which are initially set (2) and then shot-blasted (5),

characterised in that the helical compression springs prior to the processes of setting
(2) and shot-blasting (5) by virtue of specific heating and cooling processes [sic]
, a
temperature profile or strength profile which is prescribed for the subsequent

manufacturing step is produced in the cross-section of the bar, wherein a locally
defined change in the yielding point is produced in the bar cross-section of the helical

compression springs.
Method according to claim 1, characterised in that the predetermined strength profile
with regard to the cross-section of the bar is produced temporarily prior to the

processes of setting (2) and shot-blasting (5) by virtue of specific heating and cooling
processes.
Method according to claim 1, characterised in that the predetermined strength profile
with regard to the cross-section of the bar is produced permanently by virtue of

suitable manufacturing steps prior to the processes of setting (2) and shot-blasting (5)
and prevails at room temperature.
Method according to any one of claims 1 to 3, characterised in that prior to the
processes of setting (2) and shot-blasting (5) a heat treatment process is performed,

wherein the predetermined strength profile prior to the setting process (2) is different
to the predetermined strength profile prior to the shot-blasting process (5). 
Method according to any one or several of claims 1 to 4, characterised in that the
specific strength profile is not constant over the length of the bar.
