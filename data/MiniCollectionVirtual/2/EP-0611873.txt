<ABSTRACT>
Motorized actuation device for a Venetian blind or the 
like placed inside an insulating glass frame (13) including 

a first magnet (19), arranged inside the insulating glass 
frame and directly connected to the respective actuation 

system (16,18,20,21), and a second external magnet (27), 
the second magnet being associated with the translatory 

part (26) of a kinematic system (23) for converting the 
rotary motion into a translatory motion, and the kinematic 

system being connected to an actuation gearmotor (25).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an insulating glass
frame with a venetian blind or the like located therein
with a motorized device for operating the venetian blind.Venetian blinds or the like placed inside an
insulating glass frame, with magnetic operating means, are
already known.In these known devices, the Venetian blind is
accommodated in the airtight interspace formed between the
two glass panes of the insulating glass frame and is
operated, as regards the adjustment of the packing and/or
tilt of its slats, by means of a magnetic coupling, through
one of the glass panes, between a first internal magnet
connected directly to respective actuation systems and a
second external magnet.The internal mechanical devices are made so that they
are actuated by means of a straight-line movement of the
magnets.In domestic installations actuation is mostly manual.WO-A-91/14070 discloses an insulated window with a
shading element having manually-operated magnetic devices
including a combination of features as set forth in the preamble of
appended claim 1.In offices, hospitals, etc, and in all installations
where manual actuation is awkward or difficult, motorized
actuation devices that do not use a magnetic coupling have
been devised.These devices are currently placed entirely inside the
insulating glass frame, but this is a drawback, since
breakage of the likewise internal electric motor meant to
operate them forces one to open the insulating glass frame 
for replacement.This naturally causes inconveniences for the users as
well as prohibitive times and costs.A principal aim of the present invention is to provide
a device for operating a Venetian blind placed inside an
insulating glass frame that eliminates the drawback
described above in known types.A further aim of the present invention is to provide a
motorized actuation device in which the part subject to
possible breakdowns or malfunctions is outside the
insulating glass frame and can therefore be replaced simply
and rapidly.Another important aim of the invention is to provide a
motorized actuation device for Venetian blinds placed
inside an insulating glass frame to be installed in
offices, hospitals, etc., or anyway in places where manual
actuation is difficult or awkward.Another aim of the present invention is to provide a
motorized actuation device having a simple structure and a
low cost.With these aims in view, as well as others which will
become apparent hereinafter, there is provided, according
to the present invention, an insulating glass frame

<CLAIMS>
An insulating glass frame (13) including a venetian
blind (10) or the like located therein comprising a first

magnet (19), arranged inside the insulating glass frame and
directly connected to the respective actuation means

(16,18,20,21) for the venetian blind, and a second external
magnet (27), said second magnet being associated with the

translatory part (26) of a kinematic system (23) connected
with an actuation gearmotor (25) for converting the rotary

motion of the gearmotor into a translatory motion of the
second magnet, said second magnet being magnet
ically
slidably linked to said first magnet through a glass pane

of the insulating glass frame, 
characterised in that
 said
kinematic system of said actuation gearmotor are arranged

at a horizontal portion of said insulating glass frame, and
said first magnet and said second magnet are arranged for

sliding horizontally at said horizontal portion of said
insulating glass frame. 
The insulating glass frame and venetian blind or
the like of claim 1, wherein said kinematic system is a

screw-and-nut kinematic system (23) in which the worm screw
(24) is rigidly coupled to the output shaft of an electric

gearmotor (25) and the nut (26) is slidingly retained with
respect to the insulating glass frame (13).
The insulating glass frame and venetian blind or
the like according to any one or more of the preceding

claims, wherein said kinematic system (23) and said
actuation gearmotor are contained within a box-like

structure (22) which is fixed to said insulating glass
frame (13) in a removable manner.
The insulating glass frame and venetian blind or
the like according to any one or more of the preceding

claims, characterized in that said first magnet (19), 
slidingly coupled to said insulating glass frame, is

fixed to an external portion of a bush (18) that internally has a
helical profile which is shaped complementarily to the

helical profile (17) of a corresponding portion of a shaft
(16) which is arranged inside said insulating glass frame

(13) and is included in said respective actuation system.
The insulating glass frame and venetian blind or
the like of claim 4, characterized in that pulley-like

supports (20), for winding the cords (21) for adjusting the
inclination of the slats of said venetian blind or the

like, are keyed to said shaft.
The insulating glass frame and venetian blind or
the like of claim 4, characterized in that said shaft is

directly or indirectly connected to pulley-like supports
for winding the cords for packing said venetian blind or

the like.
The insulating glass frame and venetian blind or
the like of claim 6, characterized in that a gearing-up

unit is interposed between said shaft and said pulley-like
supports.
