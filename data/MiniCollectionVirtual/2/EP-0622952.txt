device dependent colour space is converted into a second 
colour separation defined in a second device dependent 

colour space of non-standard printing inks. The conversion

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a method for 
generating printing data wherein, starting from a first 
colour separation of a pixel belonging to a picture to 
be printed, picture which is defined in a first n-dimensional 
device dependent colour space, a second 
colour separation is formed for that same pixel, said 
second colour separation being defined in a second m-dimensional 
device dependent colour space of non-standard 
printing inks. Such a method is generally applied by printing 
colour prints, such as packagings or pictures in 
periodicals or books. The original is scanned by means 
of a reproduction scanning device in order to record the 
picture information, that is the content and the colour. 
Such a scanning device is built to represent the colour 
separations in a standard format such as for example 
YMCK (yellow, magenta, cyan, black). However due to 
quality constraints as well as to the purpose of the 
picture to be printed, it is not always printed with 
standard inks such as YMCK. For example the chocolate 
manufacture will prefer an ink set wherein brown ink 
plays a more dominant part. When however printing should 
be done with such non-standard inks the operator will 
have to tune the reproduction scanning device in such a 
manner that the latter will not provide him the standard 
first colour separation but a second colour separation 
which will express as good as possible the colour 
separation in a colour space of non-standard inks. For 
that purpose the operator manipulates the colour correction 
possibilities of the scanning device.  A drawback of the known method is that the 
scanning device is used for a purpose for which it is 
not suitable, in particular the generation of non-standard 
colour separations. It requires either a 
substantial experience of the operator or the production 
of a substantial number of test prints in order. to 
obtain a good result with the known method. Both solutions 
are empirical and have as consequence that they 
make the price of the whole process expensive. The object of the invention is to provide a 
method for generating printing data wherein the second 
colour separation is determined in a more efficient and 
non-empirical way and wherein thereupon the printing 
quality remains unchanged or is even increased. A method according to the invention is 
therefor characterised in that as first colour separation, 
a colour separation derived from a standard colour 
separation is determined and a set of p(p≧n) different 
colours is chosen which belong
