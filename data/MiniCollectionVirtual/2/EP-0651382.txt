<ABSTRACT>
Presented is a medium for optical data storage which can be used, 
e.g., as a microfiche, a microfilm or an optical card and comprises a 

substrate and a layer including a liquid crystalline polymer and a 
dye. At its lower end (4) the layer (2) is supported by a substrate 

(3). The concentration of the dye included in the layer (2) is non-uniform 
over the thickness (5) of the layer (2), such that the 

concentration is highest in its lower region (4). In a preferred 
embodiment, the layer (2) is divided into at least two sublayers 

(2',2''), with only the lower sublayer including a dye. These media for 
optical data storage allow an increase in the writing speed and/or a 

reduction of the required laser power.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a medium for optical data storage comprising 
a liquid crystalline polymer (LCP) which comprises a dye. Optical data storage media are known, both for analog data storage, 
e.g., microfiches, microfilms, optical cards, and for digital data 
storage, e.g., compact discs. It is known to employ LCPs in optical 
data storage, and such media are known to comprise a substrate 
carrying a layer of the LCP, which layer is recordable by means of a 
laser. It is also known to include a dye in the LCP layer in order for 
the energy of the laser to be absorbed efficiently. In this respect EP-A-0 474 473 discloses a process and apparatus for 
manufacturing optical storage devices wherein a film of liquid crystal 
material, such as a liquid crystalline polymer (LCP) is deposited on a 
substrate. LCP material can be used for thermo-optical and photo-optical 
storage media. For LCP materials which have a glass transition 
temperature Tg above ambient, localized heating by a laser beam 
produces an optically clear written spot or line resulting from rapid 
cooling of the written material into the glass phase, so that the 
clear isotropic texture is quenched into the solid glass phase. LCP 
materials which have a Tg below ambient adopt a scattering texture 
when locally heated by a laser beam. The LCP material does not require 
the application thereto of an electric field in order to produce a 
scattering texture or clear lines or spots, so that it is possible to 
make a device without electrodes, which results in a simple 
construction. The object of EP-A-0 474 473 is to provide a process and 
an apparatus for mass producing such optical storage devices. The Proceedings of the 4th Brite-EuRam Conference, Seville May 25-27, 
1992, include an article by G.R. Möhlmann, "Erasable polymeric media  
 
for analog information storage and retrieval (P-2119)." This article 
relates to a dyed, side chain liquid crystal polymeric, optical 
storage medium. The recording mechanism of this storage medium is 
based on diode laser initiated liquid-crystalline-multidomain-to-isotropic 
(scattering to clear) phase transitions. The temperature 
required for the nematic to isotropic phase change process at the so-called 
"clearing temperature (Tc)" is achieved by the conversion of 
absorbed photon energy (by the dye molecules) into heat. In this 
article optical storage films are presented which have a substrate of 
a 100 µm thick polyester film on which a 3-7 µm thick active polymer 
recording layer was deposited.
