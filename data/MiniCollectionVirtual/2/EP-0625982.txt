<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to 4-oxo and 4H-imidazo(5,1-c)(1,4)benzoxazines
and their use in the treatment of central nervous system disorders.It is well known that there are specific sites in the central nervous system of
vertebrates that exhibit a high specific affinity for binding 1,4- and 1,5-benzodiazepines.
Compounds that have a strong affinity for these receptors are continually being sought,
in order to modify therapeutic behaviour and to reduce any undersirable side-effects.US-A-4999354, US-A-4968682, US-A-4902686, US-A-4873244 and US-A-4774245
disclose imidazo(1,5-a)quinozalines.EP-A-0220845 discloses imidazole ring structures which can have an oxygen-containing
heterocyclic ring.US-A-4134974 discloses imidazo-benzoxazine structures.Danswan et al., J.C.S. Perkins I, 1049-58 (1982), provides a background for
synthesis of imidobenzoxazines and various related compounds.4-Oxo and 4H-imidazo(5,1-c)(1,4)benzoxazinones according to this invention are
of Formula (I)

where Q is -CO2R8, -CON(R9)2, (A) or (B)
wherein R1, R2 and R4 are independently H, F, Cl, Br, CF3, C1-6 alkyl, CN, OH, OC1-6
alkyl, -OCO-C1-6 alkyl or N(R9)2;R5 and R6 are independently H, C1-6 alkyl, OH, CF3, OCO-C1-6 alkyl or OCO-C6-12
aryl, or R5 and R6 together are =O;R7 is H, F, Cl, Br, I, CN, CF3, C1-3 alkyl, -CH2CH2CF3 or cyclopropyl;R9 is independently H, C1-6 alkyl, C6-12 aryl, C1-6 alkyl-C6-12 aryl, C1-6 alkyl-C6-12
heteroaryl, -C(O)R8, -C(O)N(R8)2 or -(CH2)0-5-N(R8)2; andR8 is H, C1-6 alkyl, C6-12 aryl, C1-6 alkyl-C6-12 aryl or C1-6 alkyl-hetero-C6-12 aryl, or
two R8's can be taken together to form a cyclic system, containing, in addition to the
specified nitrogen atom, one other heteroatom of sulfur, oxygen or NR9;
   and include pharmaceutically-acceptable salts thereof.The novel compounds can be used for treating central nervous system disorders
associated with the benzodiazepine receptors, e.g. as anticonvulsants, anxiolytics,
hypnotics and nootropics. Typically, the compound of Formula I is administered in the
form of a pharmaceutical composition comprising a pharmaceutically-acceptable carrier
or diluent.The compounds of the invention are substituted at the C-3 position of the
imidazole ring (Q) with an ester, amide or substituted oxadiazole system. Preferably, the
C-4 position on the axazine ring (R5,6) is unsubstituted or substituted by alkyl or
hydroxyl, or R5 and R6 taken together form a carbonyl group. Apart from the F
substituent, the aromatic ring (R1-4) is preferably unsubstituted, or it can be substituted
by
