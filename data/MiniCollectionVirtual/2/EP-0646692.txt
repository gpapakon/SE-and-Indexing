<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a cross bar connection for insulating glass panes, which is formed from intersecting aluminium hollow profiles which are connected to one another in the region of intersection by a connecting piece which engages into the hollow profiles, each cross bar connection comprising a continuous bar and two transverse bars which laterally adjoin said continuous bar and are fastened on the continuous bar by the connecting piece, which crosses through the continuous bar, projects out of it on both sides and can be plugged in to the two transverse bars by means of the projecting ends. The invention further relates to a process for producing such a cross bar connection. The cross bar connection can be produced in a simple manner and also fulfils the desired requirements from a visual point of view.
