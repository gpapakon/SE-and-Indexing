<ABSTRACT>
Water dispersible, one component, self 
crosslinkable poly(urethane-urea) composition that is 

stable and capable of curing at room temperature is 
prepared by forming a prepolymer comprising an 

alcoholized drying oil; a diisocyanate, a polyalkylene 
ether polyol, and a dihydroxy containing alkanoic acid 

polyol; neutralizing the prepolymer; contacting the 
neutralized prepolymer with water and diamine wherein 

the alcoholized drying oil has a sufficient content of 
monoglycerides to allow for chain extension in step (C) 

and the poly(urethane-urea) self-crosslinks upon 
drying. The waterborne poly(urethane-urea) composition 

exhibits good chemical resistance, adhesion, abrasion, 
and high gloss properties when used as a coating.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to water-dispersible
poly(urethane-urea) compositions that are useful as
coatings.Solvent based poly(urethane-urea)
compositions made from drying oils have been sold for
use as coatings for fabrics, plastics, wood, metal, and
the like. These coating compositions offer good
properties at a reasonable price. Nevertheless, there
is a continued need to develop new waterborne
poly(urethane-urea) coatings based on drying oils for a
number of reasons including environmental and
economical concerns associated with solvents.Although various preparations of drying oil
based waterborne poly(urethane-urea) compositions are
known, discovery of new preparations and alternative
compositions is needed to extend the mechanical
properties of the polyurethane compositions.One problem in particular that is associated
with poly(urethane-urea) water dispersions is the
inability of the composition to crosslink at room
temperature upon drying. This is desirable because the
composition's properties, such as chemical resistance
and mechanical strength, are extended upon the
crosslinking. Application EP-A 647 665,
describes a technique so
that crosslinking is achieved at room temperature by
including a polyalkylene ether polyol in the polymer
formation. The presence of the polyalkylene ether
polyol allows for chain extension upon the inclusion of
an amine and subsequent crosslinking of the
poly(urethane-urea) upon drying.Although this method represents a valuable
advance in the art because it is a one component,
crosslinkable poly(urethane-urea) composition, it would
be desirable to find alternative methods of preparing
crosslinkable, one-component poly(urethane-urea)
compositions. The problems stated above have been solved
with the discovery of novel poly(urethane-urea)
compositions preparable by a process comprising: (A)
forming a prepolymer comprising: (1) an alcoholized
drying oil; (2) a diisocyanate; (3) a dihydroxy
containing alkanoic acid polyol; (B) neutralizing said
prepolymer; (C) contacting said neutralized prepolymer
with water and a diamine to form an amine chain
extended poly(urethane-urea) dispersion wherein said
alcoholized drying oil has a sufficient content of
monoglycerides to allow for chain extension in step (C)
and so that the chain-extended poly(urethane-urea)
crosslinks upon drying.In a second embodiment of the invention, a
polyalkylene ether polyol is included in the prepolymer
formation thus extending the composition's properties.The inventive composition provides a one
component,
