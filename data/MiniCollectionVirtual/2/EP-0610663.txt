<ABSTRACT>
A carrier for one or more reaction zones incorporated in the form of channels in this carrier, each of which zones is equipped with a colour indicator, is to be improved in such a way that a simply carried out, individually alterable coating of the reaction zones with the required indicators, which may be different, can be realised with uniform coating density. This is achieved by means of a carrier which is divided into an upper part (2) and a lower part (3), between which a sandwich-type film composite (4) is accommodated. A reagent carrier film (12) is provided with the reaction zones and is covered by a channel film which delimits the reaction zones in the form of channels. A particularly favourable embodiment for the reaction zones is in the form of a perforation matrix (12) in which carrier spheres (balls) (13) are accommodated, which spheres are impregnated with the indicator.
