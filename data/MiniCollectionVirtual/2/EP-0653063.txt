<ABSTRACT>
An (in vitro) test kit and an (in vitro) test method which determine dermal corrosion properties of a test substance and/or mixture are disclosed. The test substance is applied directly to a biobarrier designed to give corrosion times comparable to those of the (in vivo) dermal corrosion test. A corrosive test substance destroys and passes through the biobarrier, after which the test substance enters and reacts with the adjacent chemical detection system, where the test substance is detected. The detection time, or the time from application to detection, can be correlated with UN Packing Groups and EEC classes.

<DESCRIPTION>
 IN VITRO TEST FOR DERMAL CORROSIVE PROPERTIESTechnical FieldThis invention relates to the field of testing materials for their ability to be corrosive to human skin. More specifically, the invention relates to a device and a method for an in vitro test which can predict the ability of a material to cause corrosion when placed in contact with the human skin.Background ArtAs the potential for wider varieties of materials to cause cutaneous damage has become recognized, an increasing effort has been made by industry and environment protection groups to characterize this potential. Federal legislative agencies and commercial manufacturers must consider these risks when developing registering, certifying and shipping materials which could produce toxic effects.Acute primary irritation is defined as localized reversible inflammatory response of normal living skin to direct injury and is caused by a single application of a chemical agent. Important manifestations are erythema (redness) and edema (swelling). Draize et al., J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 81:337, 1944. 

 Cu ulativÎ² irritation is also reversible and consists of primary irritation resulting from repeated exposure of skin to materials that do not cause primary irritation, as reviewed by Guillot et al., Fd. Chem. Toxic 20: 563, 1982.Corrosion is defined as direct chemical action on normal living skin that results in its disintegration and irreversible alteration on site of chemical contact. According to Draize, et al. It is manifested by ulceration or necrosis. (Draize, ibid.)Animals have been used to test for toxic effects. However, the problems inherent in animal testing contribute to variability of all these methods.1. Intra-laboratory variability in scoring and handling2. Individual responses vary considerably3. Application and occlusive seal . Sex and age of animalsTo evaluate dermal corrosivity, a procedure based on the Department of Transportation Method ofTesting Corrosion to skin has been widely used. Code of Federal Regulations, Transportation Title 49, Part 173, Appendix A. Method of Testing Corrosion to the Skin (1983) . Six white New Zealand rabbits are shaved, the test substance and a negative control is applied to the shaved skin of each rabbit. Each substances is held in place with a 1 x 1" square 12-ply surgical gauze pad. Corrosion is found if the test sample caused destruction or irreversible alteration of the tissue on at least two of the six rabbits.In 1977 the United Nations issued special recommendations for class 8 chemicals.
