<ABSTRACT>
Linked cyclic polyamines of formula: Z - R - A - R' - Y, where Z and Y are each cyclic polyamine moieties, A is an aromatic or heteroaromatic moiety, and R and R' are each an alkylene chain or heteroatom-containing chain, show high activity against HIV, and low toxicity, in in vivo tests. Novel compounds, and pharmaceutical compositions are claimed.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention
concerns compositions and compounds having activity in in vitro
tests on Human Immunodeficiency Virus-infected cells.The disease known as Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome
(AIDS) caused by infection by HIV has attracted immense research effort
because of the effects of the disease on infected individuals and the dangers of
the disease spreading to a wider section of the population. In general, although
various chemo-therapeutic treatments have been advocated, and some 
compounds have emerged as a potential basis for treatment, there is still a need
for alternatives. In particular, most treatments such as the compound known as
AZT have a high toxicity to cells, and it would be desirable to find compounds
which are less toxic. In man, the development of resistance to AZT has been
identified as an additional clinical problem.We have found a group of compounds which show protective
properties in in vitro screens of cells challenged with HIV-1 and/or HIV-2, and
are therefore useful for the treatment of AIDS and AIDS Related Complex and
other viral and especially retroviral infections. Accordingly, the present
invention provides the use of compounds defined below, in pharmaceutical
compositions for treating HIV-infected patients. The invention further provides
pharmaceutical compositions comprising a said compound in combination or
association with a pharmaceutically acceptable diluent or excipient, for the
treatment of HIV-infected patients. The invention may also be defined as the
use of a said compound for the manufacture of a medicament for the treatment
of HIV-infected patients. The invention further provides a process for the
production of a pharmaceutical composition for the treatment of a HIV-infected
patient, comprising the combination of a compound as defined below with a
pharmaceutically acceptable diluent or excipient, and formulating said
composition into a form suitable for administration to said patient. The
invention also provides a method of treatment of an HIV-infected patient,
comprising administering to said patient an effective dose of a said compound.
It is to be understood that treatment includes prophylactic treatment of patients 
at risk, in view of the protective properties observed. The use of the
compounds may also be stated as a method of treating HIV-infected or HIV-challenged
human cells to prevent or modulate the multiplication of the HIV,
comprising administering to said cells an effective dose of a said compound.
