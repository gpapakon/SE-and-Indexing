<ABSTRACT>
A method and system are provided for feeding a 
slurry of energetic wastes, such as propellants or 

explosives, dissolved in a volatile solvent such as acetone, 
for introduction into a molten salt for destruction of such 

waste, without vaporization of the solvent in the feeding 
device or injector, and without deposition of explosive 

residue on the inside surface of such injector. This is 
achieved by introducing carbon dioxide liquid into the 

slurry feeding device or injector, and into heat exchange 
relation with the feed slurry to cool the slurry and prevent 

vaporization of the volatile solvent, and to thereby prevent 
deposition of explosive solid residue in the feed injector. 

The injector is mounted on the vessel which contains the 
molten salt and such vessel is positioned in a furnace for 

heating the molten salt to reaction temperature. Although 
the injector for feeding the propellant slurry is heated by 

the furnace, sufficient cooling is achieved by the liquid 
carbon dioxide within the injector to prevent vaporization 

of the volatile solvent.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to the destruction of 
explosives and propellants, and is particularly directed to 
an improved process for feeding a slurry of energetic 
wastes, such as a propellant or explosive, dissolved in a 
volatile solvent into a waste destruction system, while 
preventing vaporization of the solvent and leaving an 
explosive solid residue on the feeding device. Propellants and explosives are energetic systems 
containing energetic groups such as nitrate and azide 
groups, and finely-divided metal particles. The problem is 
to dispose of these materials as a waste. The use of a 
molten salt bath containing alyali metal carbonate for 
destroying propellant and explosive wastes has been 
developed. Because these materials are so sensitive as 
solids to potential detonation, the practice has been to 
dissolve them in an organic solvent such as ketones (e.g.  
 
acetone),ethers and acetates, to make a pumpable slurry. 
However, since ketones, ethers and acetates 
used to form the slurry are very volatile, where a feed 
injector is located within a heated vessel in a molten salt 
waste destruction system, the heat transferred to the feed 
injector is such that it is likely to vaporize the organic 
solvent and leave a solid residue on the inside of the 
injector piping and which may potentially detonate. The present invention provides a method and system 
for actively cooling the injector for feeding the energetic 
waste slurry of a propellant or explosive containing a 
volatile organic solvent such as acetone, while the slurry 
is being heated, so that the solvent in the slurry does not 
evaporate and no explosive residue forms and the slurry is 
discharged from the feed injector for passage to the waste 
destruction system, such as a molten salt bath. According to the invention, such cooling of the 
energetic waste is achieved using carbon dioxide liquid. 
The carbon dioxide liquid is introduced into an annulus of 
the injector for heat exchange with the waste 
slurry passing through a central tube in the injector. 
Since the feed injector is normally mounted within a furnace  
 
containing a molten salt waste destruction bath, common 
aqueous coolants such as water could not be employed because 
if a leak developed in the injector, water would be 
introduced into the molten salt bath which could result in a 
steam explosion. Where carbon dioxide liquid is employed 
according to the present invention, it will vaporize during 
heat exchange cooling with the waste slurry in the injector, 
and
