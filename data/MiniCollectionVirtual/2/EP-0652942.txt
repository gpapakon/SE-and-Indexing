<ABSTRACT>
Sensor devices for examining fluid samples having, between the sample under examination and a detector, a membrane made of polyvinyl chloride in un-plasticised form. This membrane material acts as a barrier to paracetamol and sugars but is permeable to hydrogen peroxide and to oxalate, so these species can be determined after passing through the membrane. When they are not present as such in the sample, they may be formed from analytes which are sought (e.g. by enzymic action, which is especially applicable to the determination of glucose, using an oxidase enzyme). The membranes may be made by solvent casting, conveniently to a thickness of 10 to 40 (my)m, and used in electrolytic systems with a platinum anode. The membrane material can be formed into multi-layer membranes, which may incorporate layers of material to protect it or modify the permeability, or added materials for example enzymes.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to sensor devices such as are used in 
the determination of a component or components which may be 
present in a fluid sample, such as a physiological fluid (e.g. 
blood) or other fluids of biological origin (e.g. fruit), process 
fluids or effluents. Many forms of sensor have been proposed, and commonly these 
rely on some form of membrane to control the extent to which the 
components present in a sample under examination can gain access 
to an electrode, at which they can then be detected and 
determined. Especially, it is well known to make sensors using 
membranes to separate the media being analysed from the active 
electrode itself. The main function of the membrane is to 
separate, as far as possible, those components which are 
desirable (i.e. can take part in the reactions at the electrode 
on which the desired determination depends) from interferents 
(i.e. compounds which may be present but are undesirable because 
they either interfere with the progress of the desired 
determination reactions or take part in reactions of their own 
which compete with those of the component sought and distort or 
overwhelm the signals which are to be measured. The forms of 
construction have much in common with each other, and mainly 
differ in the nature of the membrane or media within it or 
combined with it in some way. Some forms of sensor rely on the components used to make the 
membrane, while others rely on the mode of fabrication of the 
membrane, selecting its physical properties (for example its 
porosity) or treatments given to it, as these factors can control 
its effectiveness and selectivity in use. Other forms of sensors incorporate an enzyme, which converts 
one substrate compound or analyte into another which may then be 
more easily measured. Especially, it is known to use oxidase 
enzymes, which generate hydrogen peroxide -- a substance which 
can be measured very conveniently and very accurately by 
electrolytic methods, especially amperometrically. An example is  
 
European Patent No. 216577 (of ICI PLC) which specifies an enzyme 
electrode sensor with membrane barrier of low (>5%) porosity. Materials which have been proposed for the fabrication of 
membranes for sensors include polyvinyl chloride (PVC), but only 
in plasticised form, as described in European Patent Application 
No. 92302131.5, where the plasticiser performs a necessary part 
of the function of the membrane. Such known sensors, utilising various membrane materials, 
are very valuable in analytical

A sensor device comprising means for detecting 
components present in fluid samples and providing an 

output representative of the content of said component, 
comprising a detecting means (especially a detecting 

means of an electrochemical nature) and a membrane 
barrier between the detecting means and the sample to be 

analysed, characterised in that the membrane barrier is 
composed of polyvinyl chloride (PVC) itself, in un-plasticised 

form. 
A sensor device as claimed in Claim 1 which comprises a 
detecting means in contact with an electrolyte medium and 

both associated with a membrane of polyvinyl chloride 
(PVC) itself, in un-plasticised form, which provides an 

interface for contact with a sample to be analysed and 
interposed between the active electrode (anode) of the 

cell used as detector. 
A sensor device as claimed in Claim 2 wherein the 
detecting means comprises an electrode system and a 

liquid or gel phase electrolyte-containing medium, which 
is preferably aqueous or aqueous-based.

chloride is impermeable, wherein the enzyme (with which 
the desired substrate species can interact and generate 

another species to which the un-plasticised polyvinyl 
chloride is permeable) is situated outside the un-plasticised 

polyvinyl chloride membrane, so that the
