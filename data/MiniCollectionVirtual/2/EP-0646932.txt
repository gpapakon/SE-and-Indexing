<ABSTRACT>
A circuit comprising a pair of a CAM cell (10) for storing variable-length codes and a RAM cell (20) for 
storing data used for mask processing. This circuit further has an NMOS (30) which is connected between the CAM 

cell (10) and a match line ML, and cuts off the CAM cell (10) from the match line ML by use of the output of the 
RAM cell (20). The CAM cell (10) checks a code applied from the outside with the code stored in it. If these codes 

are agreed with each other, the CAM cell (10) outputs an H level signal which represents the agreement to the match 
line ML. If disagreed, it outputs an L level signal which represents the disagreement to the match line ML. If the 

CAM cell does not engage in the checking operation, the corresponding RAM cell (20) outputs an L level signal to 
turn off the NMOS (30). When the NMOS is turned off, the output from the CAM cell (10) is not transmitted to the 

match line ML.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a variable-length code decoding
system for decoding a compressed image, etc.There is the following literature disclosing a technique for decoding a
variable-length code.Literature: IEEE 1992 Custom Integrated Circuits Conference, "A
Video-Rate, JPEG Chip Set" p. 26. 2. 1-26. 2. 4., authored by Daniel A.
Luthi, Po Tong, Peter A. Ruetz.This literature discloses the technique using a variable-length code
as a means for compressing an image data or for restoring and decoding
the compressed image data.The variable-length code means a code which is allocated in
response to frequency of occurrence of parameters after the image data
has been subjected to an arithmetic operation such as a Discrete Cosine
Transform (hereinafter referred to as DCT) operation and a quantisation
operation. That is, a short code is allocated to a parameter which
frequently occurs while a long code is allocated to a parameter which less
occurs. By varying the length of the code as mentioned above, the
number of codes can be reduced as a whole, thereby realising
improvement in compression rate of the image data.Since an image display rate on a display of a TV set or a monitor
must be kept at a given value when restoring a dynamic image, the variable
length code as set forth above is always required to be restored at a 
constant rate. It is practically preferable to decode one variable-length
code in one clock cycle. Since an image data is required to be processed
at high speed in recent years, an improvement of a decoding speed of the
variable-length code is important as one means for realising a high speed
processing speed of the image data.US-A-5,173,695 discloses a variable-length decoder for use in a
data transmission system. The decoder uses a lookup table to decode the
sequentially occurring bits in the received data signal. A memory stores
information associated with each possible input word, including word length
and a fixed-length codeword. In response to a control signal, a barrel
shifter shifts its decoding window across the sequence of input bits as each
codeword is detected. The window is shifted after each word is decoded
by a shift length corresponding to the length of the just-decoded word.It is an object of the invention to provide a variable-length code
decoding system for realising a high operation speed.In accordance with the present invention, there is provided a
variable-length code decoding system comprising:-
an input node to which is applied a variable-length code string
