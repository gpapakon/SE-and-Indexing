<ABSTRACT>
A method for polishing an optical quality surface, such 
as an ophthalmic lens, to finish which can accept a 

hardenable protective coating without using an abrasive 
slurry or gel, including the steps of: (a) providing 

an optical lens having a first major surface, the first 
major surface having an initial Rtm value of greater 

than 0.35 micrometers; (b) bringing the first major 
surface into a frictional contacting relationship with 

an abrasive article (10), wherein the abrasive article 
includes a sheet-like structure having deployed on at 

least one major surface thereof a plurality of 
individual abrasive composites, each composite having a 

plurality of abrasive particles dispersed in a binder; 
and (c) moving at least one of the contacting first 

major surface and abrasive article relative to each 
other with rotational and/or oscillatory movement in 

the presence of a liquid substantially free of abrasive 
particles in a manner and for a time effective to 

polish the first major surface to provide a final Rtm 
value in the first major surface of 0.30 micrometers or 

less.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a method for polishing
and finishing an optical quality surface with a
structured or three-dimensional abrasive article which
does not require an external loose grain abrasive
slurry or gel.The grinding and polishing of optical quality
surfaces are important processes in producing
acceptable surfaces on optical components such as
lenses, prisms, mirrors, and the like. For instance,
the majority of today's population requires some form
of corrective eye wear, and for many, this includes
corrective eyeglasses.Every prescription eyeglass lens, including those for
sunglasses and safety glasses, must be individually
prepared for the specific customer. While plastic
lenses may be the primary material which is polished,
the processes described herein are also contemplated to
be applicable to other optical quality materials, such
as glass. One customary method of preparing an optical
lens, namely, an ophthalmic lens, for the end user
consists of several steps which include grinding,
fining, polishing and hard coating. Each optical lens
begins as a blank lens, into which the desired
curvature is imparted by the series of steps.As indicated above, a conventional production of a
smooth finished lens surface involves three basic
operations. The first step is rough grinding for curve
generation using a tool having a preformed, curved
surface which is plated or impregnated with diamond,
tungsten carbide, or other super-hard particles of the
desired grit size. This tool is used to generate the
desired radius or radii of curvature onto the lens
form. The resultant lens surface usually is of the 
approximate curvature required, but is neither precise
enough nor smooth enough to directly polish to the
desired, final state. The next step, called "fining",
in general, involves a preliminary finishing of the
coarse ground surface to reduce deep scratches and
provide a substantially smooth although not polished
surface. The last step, called the "polishing" step, in
general, involves fine grinding to remove scratches and
provide a smooth, finished, or, in the case of an
optical component, an optically clear surface which can
receive a scratch-resistant hard coating, which is
typically a curable polymer coating. This invention is
concerned with the polishing step.In somewhat greater detail, the fining step
corrects the surface geometry of the lens to the exact
requirement, and produces a surface texture that is
smoothed sufficiently to enable the lens to be polished
at a later stage from a generally
