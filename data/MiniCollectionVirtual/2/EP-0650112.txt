<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a constant-current source which contains two JFETs and a simple resistance network. In this arrangement, the current saturation current is measured by a JFET and converted by the resistance network into a control voltage for the other JFET which generates the desired constant current. Such a circuit can be used for compensating within a wide range for production tolerances, particularly those of the JFETs and for temperature fluctuations due to operation.

Constant current source with a settable constant current, which is produced with
the assistance of a semiconductor element, characterised thereby


that a voltage dividing circuit is present, consisting of a series connection of a
second field effect transistor (A2), which is connected as a current source, with the

terminals of source (S2), drain (D2) and gate (G2), wherein the drain (D2) is
connected to one pole (M) of a voltage source (Sp), the source (S2) and gate (G2)
