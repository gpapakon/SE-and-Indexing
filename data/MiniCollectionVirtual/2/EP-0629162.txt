<ABSTRACT>
A security device (2) particularly for a motor vehicle which is adapted to isolate the fuel supply from the engine of the vehicle. The security device (2) includes a first body member (6) locatable at one side of a vehicle floor (10) and a second body member (8) locatable at an opposite, second side of said floor (10), said body members (6, 8) being securable together through said floor (10) by means (12) located at said second side engaging means (14) extending from a lower surface of said first body member (6), a rotatable locking device (26) located in said first body member (6) and a rotatable valve member (46) located in said second body member (8) and being movable, upon rotation of said locking device (26), from a first position allowing fuel to flow through said valve member (46) to a second position preventing such flow, the security device (2) being devoid of any release means at said one side of said vehicle floor (10).

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to security devices for fluid flow 
lines, particularly but not exclusively for motor vehicles 
such as cars, vans, lorries, and other such vehicles. The theft of motor vehicles is a very serious problem and 
is becoming more prevalent, and the situation is becoming 
increasingly dangerous due to the so-called 'joy riders', 
many of whom are under-aged and inexperienced drivers, 
taking away vehicles and driving them at speeds far in 
excess of the legal limits. Many accidents - and deaths - 
have been caused by these so-called 'joy riders'. There have been many proposals for motor vehicle security 
devices which are designed and intended to cut-off or 
isolate the fuel supply to the engine from a supply 
source, but none of the prior proposed devices have proved 
totally secure and satisfactory. This has been due in no 
small part to the fact that, although the main component 
parts of the devices are located beneath the floor of the 
vehicle, access to such component parts can be had through 
said floor from the interior of the vehicle, and indeed 
the whole device in many instances can be loosened - and 
subsequently removed - by releasing securing means located 
above the floor and within the vehicle. Such prior devices 
are rendered ineffectual within minutes, and in some cases  
 
within seconds, and have proved totally unsatisfactory in 
preventing unauthorised removal and driving of a motor 
vehicle. Two known vehicle security devices are disclosed in United 
States Patents Nos 3,695,287 and 3,855,828, but the 
devices disclosed in these prior patents are extremely 
complicated in construction. In United States Patent No 
3,695,827 the device includes a lock body member having an 
integral threaded extension portion which is engaged by a 
nut so as to locate the device in position. A tapered 
plug, cooperating with a valve body, is screw-threaded 
into the lock body member, the tapered plug and valve body 
being maintained in cooperating relationship by yet 
another threaded member. To mount the device in position 
relative to a bulkhead or other floor or wall, it is 
necessary to utilise a mounting bracket which is interposed 
between the bulkhead and the afore-mentioned nut, 
and it is necessary to support the valve body member by 
securing it to the mounting bracket. In United States Patent No 3,855,828 the device comprises 
a single solid housing which contains a metal lock 
cylinder and which is secured in position relative to a 
bulkhead by means of a nut engaging an

A security device for insertion into a fluid flow 
line (4) of a member, said device comprising a first body 

member (6) locatable wholly at one side of a floor or wall 
of said member and a second body member (8) locatable 

wholly at an opposite, second side of said floor or wall 
and being securable to said first bod
y member (6), a 
rotatable locking device (26) located in and carried by 

said first body member (6) and a rotatable valve member 
(46) located in said second body member (8), said valve 

member (46) being movable, upon rotation of said locking 
device (26), from a first position allowing fluid to flow 

through said valve member (46) to a second position 
preventing such flow, said first and second body members 

(6,8) being securable together to enclose said locking 
device (26) and said valve member (46) by securing means 

located at said second side of said floor or wall and 
engaging means extending from a surface of said first body 

member (6) which confronts said floor or wall, such that 
said security device is devoid of any release means at 

said one side of said floor or wall, whereby 
said means extending from said surface of said first body 

member (6) comprise a plurality of threaded shanks (14) 
which pass through through-bores (22) in said second body  

 
member (8) and which are engageable by said securing means 

(12). 
A security device according to Claim 1,
 
characterised in that said shanks (14) are engageable by 

securing devices comprising seperable sleeves and nuts 
(12), said nuts being adapted to break away from said 

sleeves upon application of a certain torque to said nuts 
so as to secure said first and second body members (6,8) 

together by said sleeves. 
A security device according to Claim 1 or Claim 2,
 
characterised in that said first body member (6) includes 

a domed portion (22) for housing said locking device (26), 
said locking device being held captive within said first 

body member (6) by means (28,30) located beneath said 
domed portion (22) and within the confines of said first 

body member (6). 
A security device according to any of Claims 1 to 3,
 
characterised in that said second body member (8) includes 

a recess or bore (42) for housing said rotatable valve 
member, said second body member (8) including a through-bore 

(48) communicating with said recess (42) and said 
valve member (46) when located therein.  

 
A security device according to Claim 4,
 
characterised in that said through-bore (48) communicates 

with a through-bore (50) in said valve member (46) in the 
first position of said valve member. 
A security device according to any of Claims 3 to 5,
 
characterised in that said locking device (26) has a body 

which includes parallel-sided portions (34) which are 
engageable with parallel-sided portions (36) of the first 

body member (6) to prevent relative rotation between the 
body of the locking device and the first body member (6). 
A security device according to any of Claims 4 to 6,
 
characterised in that said valve member (26) is retained 

in the recess or bore (42) in the second body member (8) 
by means of a burred washer (54). 
A security device according to any of the preceding 
Claims, characterised in that said rotatable valve member 

(46) carries a plurality of O-ring seals (52) to prevent 
leakage of fluid past said valve member (46) and upwardly 

through said locking device (26). 
A security device according to any of Claims 1 to 8,
 
characterised in that said device has a protective cover  

 
(16) for said second body member (8).
