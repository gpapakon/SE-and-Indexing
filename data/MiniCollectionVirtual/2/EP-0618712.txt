<ABSTRACT>
A multiple node telecommunication system path identification technique 
enabling expedited path testing and/or monitoring, and providing rapid confirmation upon 

completion of a successful testing and/or monitoring function. The technique eliminates 
erroneous system alarms arising from a properly transmitted PID arriving at a given node prior 

to the receipt at that node of the correct PID from a system controller. This is accomplished 
by employing a memory at each system node capable of storing the most recent PID sent to 

the node by the system controller, the previous PID sent to the node by the system controller, 
and the PID received from another system node, or from a transmitter linked to a system 

transmission path. Each of the nodes within the telecommunication system facilitating the 
technique is further adapted to accept a PID received via a transmission path without 

triggering an alarm, if that received PID matches either the most recent or previous PIDs 
received from the system controller. The nodes are also configured to tolerate a mismatch 

between a PID received via a transmission path and the stored PIDs received from the system 
controller for a specified period of time before initiating an alarm, so that if the mismatch may 

be reconciled if it is merely an erroneous condition brought about by a delay in 
communication between the node and the system controller.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to telecommunication networks and, more particularly, to 
management systems for such networks. In carrying out various testing and/or monitoring functions within multiple node 
telecommunication systems, it is necessary to identify specific internode cross-connect paths. 
Typically, these testing/monitoring functions are categorized as follows: new link/circuit 
testing; idle link monitoring; and pre-service circuit testing. New link/circuit testing is a long 
and involved process designed to detect transmission circuit quality. Idle link monitoring is 
typically performed as an ongoing maintenance function to ascertain the status of existing idle 
links. Pre-service circuit testing is performed immediately prior to placing a given circuit path 
into service (during system reconfiguration or path restoration). While the time it takes to 
perform such testing/monitoring may not be critical for new link testing, it is of concern in 
most other instances and should be kept to a minimum. When performing the above testing and monitoring functions, a path trace 
identification signal ("PID") is transmitted over a specified path, and its receipt monitored at 
each node along that path. Within present multiple node telecommunication systems, which 
conform to Consultative Committee on International Telegraphy and Telephony ("CCITT") 
recommendation G.783, each node has the capability of storing two PID values -- the received 
PID, and the expected PID. A two-node portion of one such system is illustrated in FIG. 1. 
In performing a testing or monitoring function within the illustrated system, the proper PID 
is transmitted by system controller 101 to each of nodes 102 and 103 via control lines 104 and 
105. The PID received from system controller 101 is stored in a memory location within each 
node reserved for "expected" PIDs (memory location 106 for node 102, and memory location 
107 for node 103). This stored "expected" PID will remain in the reserved memory within 
a node until the node receives a new "expected" PID from the system controller. Each node 
within the system acknowledges the receipt of a new "expected" PID from the system 
controller by transmitting a confirmation signal to the system controller.  Upon receipt of a confirmation signal from all of the nodes within the path, the 
system controller sends a clearance message to transmitter 108. After receiving this clearance 
message, transmitter 108 transmits the proper PID to nodes 102 and 103 via transmission path 
109.
