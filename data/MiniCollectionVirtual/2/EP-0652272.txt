<ABSTRACT>
An emulsion and emulsion drilling fluid are disclosed. The emulsion has 
utility as an oil based drilling fluid comprising a glycol emulsified in a synthetic 

hydrocarbon material. The synthetic hydrocarbon material has an average 
molecular weight of from about 120 to 1,000 and is synthesized from one or more 

olefinic monomers having a chain length of C₂ to C₁₄.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to improved drilling fluids used in the drilling of 
subterranean oil and gas wells as well as other drilling fluid applications and 
drilling procedures. The invention is particularly concerned with non-polluting, 
minimally toxic drilling fluids. In rotary drilling there are a variety of functions and characteristics that are 
expected of a drilling fluid ("drilling mud" or simply "mud"). The drilling fluid is 
expected to carry cuttings from beneath the bit, transport them up the annulus, and 
permit their separation at the surface while at the same time the rotary bit is 
cooled and cleaned. A drilling mud is also intended to reduce friction between the 
drill string and the sides of the hole while maintaining the stability of uncased 
sections of the borehole. Likewise the drilling fluid is formulated to prevent 
unwanted influxes of formation fluids from permeable rocks penetrated and 
likewise to form a thin, low permeability filter cake which seals pores and other 
openings and formations penetrated by the bit. Finally, the drilling fluid is used to 
collect and interpret information available from drill cuttings, cores and electrical 
logs. Drilling fluids are typically classified according to their base material. In 
water based muds, solid particles are suspended in water or brine. Oil can be 
emulsified in the water. Nonetheless the water is the continuous phase. Oil based 
muds are exactly the opposite. Solid particles are suspended in oil and water or  
 
brine is emulsified in the oil and therefore the oil is the continuous phase. The 
final class of drilling fluids are pneumatic fluids in which drill cuttings are 
removed by a high velocity stream of air or natural gas. On both offshore and inland drilling barges and rigs, drill cuttings are 
conveyed up the hole by a drilling fluid. Water based drilling fluids may be 
suitable for drilling in certain types of formations: however, for proper drilling in 
other formations, it is desirable to use an oil base drilling fluid. With an oil base 
drilling fluid, the cuttings, besides ordinarily containing moisture, are necessarily 
coated with an adherent film or layer of oily drilling fluid which may penetrate 
into the interior of the cuttings. This is true despite the use of various vibrating 
screens, mechanical separation devices and various chemical and washing 
techniques. Because of pollution to the environment, whether on water or on 
land, the cuttings cannot be permanently discarded until the pollutants have
