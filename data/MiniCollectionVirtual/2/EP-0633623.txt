<ABSTRACT>
Electrical connectors are manufactured in the form 
of a strip of micro-connectors stamped from an integral 

piece, each having a parallelepipedical body (4) in the 
shape of a "U" having a bottom portion (5) and two sidewalls 

capable of being inwardly crimped. The bottom portion (5) 
is centrally hollowed out and has in the inner ends thereof 

two sets of small metallic tongues (6,7,8) that are spaced 
apart from each other by contact slots (9,10) of different 

sizes. The sidewalls include a positioner rod (11A,11B) 
located adjacent to two legs (16,17) located on the ends 

thereof, each of the legs (16,17) having two cutouts 
(12A,12B,13A,13B,14A,14B,15A,15B) in the shape of a "V". An 

automated tool (31) for application of the micro-connectors, 
is unique in that it applies these reduced sized connectors. 

The tool has a wire cut system which cuts wires on the side 
ends of the crimper (35) of the application tool (31) so 

that the wires are arranged side by side after cutting. The 
tool, additionally, has a wire positioning system which 

permits the application of micro-connectors in both tapping 
and splicing situations.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to electrical 
connecting devices employed in the splicing of 
multiconductor telephone cables comprised of electrical 
conductors of different or same gauge using only one 
type of connector, and to automated tools for applying 
the connecting device. More specifically, the present 
invention relates to a type of connector for splicing 
multiconductor telephone cables which requires a 
specific application tool, to crimp the connector. In splicing telephone cables, the cable ends are 
arranged to each other and the individual wires in the 
cables are spliced by the operator or lineman. When the 
ends of two pairs of wires are being connected to each 
other, it is necessary to make two separate electrical 
connections, i.e., to connect each corresponding end of 
the wires of the two pairs. In accordance with prior art practice, when the 
ends of a severed telephone cable are being spliced, the 
lineman first separates from the numerous pairs in each 
end the particular pairs which are to be connected. He 
then separates the two wires in each of the pairs and 
makes electrical connections between the ends of these 
wires. After making the connections for these pairs, he 
can then proceed to a next two pair of wires in the 
cable and make the electrical connections for it. In order to facilitate the electrical connections 
between wires of two pairs, as described above, several 
connecting systems were developed in which the 
technician can separate and identify the ends of two 
pairs of wires. He can then splice the ends of the 
wires using a specific device and an application tool. Such connectors for splicing telephone cables are 
already known. However, the connectors commercially 
available have certain drawbacks, such as size, the 
amount of wires used by the same connector and the size  
 
of the final splice of the multiconductor telephone 
cables. Accordingly, it is desirable to develop a new 
connector for splicing multiconductor telephone cables 
which has reduced size in relation to the known 
connectors, and which can cover a wide range of wire 
gauges for the same connector. In addition, it should 
cover all combinations of application of cables for 
connectors of prior art and further which reduce the 
disadvantages presented by the connectors of prior art. Automatic tools for application of connectors of 
the prior art are usually of the type having a slot 
which extends transversely between its ends. The wires 
which should be spliced are generally positioned
