<ABSTRACT>
An ignition and engine control system for an 
internal combustion engine. The system includes a flyback 

ignition transformer which can rapidly re-fired a spark plug 
during a combustion cycle to perform various ignition 

diagnostic procedures using the spark plug as a feedback 
element of the control system. The transformer is adapted 

for mounting directly to a spark plug and includes a core 
about which a primary and secondary are toroidally wound. A 

controller provides signals to a circuit which causes maximum 
charging of the transformer for ignition and subsequent 

charging of the transformer for diagnostic purposes. The 
system also includes a diagnostic circuit which can detect 

the occurrence of an electrical discharge, and/or its 
duration, across the spark plug as a result of one of the 

diagnostic charges by monitoring the transformer for a 
reflected voltage in its primary. The detection circuit 

outputs a signal to the controller which allows the 
controller to diagnose conditions within the combustion 

cylinder.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention generally relates to a 
automotive ignition system for an internal combustion 
engine. More particularly, this invention relates to a 
coil-on-plug ignition transformer which is capable of 
being fired according to an algorithm to perform 
various engine diagnostic procedures. The spark plug 
mounted ignition system of the present invention 
therefore operates as a feedback element of the engine 
control system. In order to initiate combustion of an 
air/fuel mixture within an internal combustion engine, 
a spark ignition system generates a high voltage arc 
across the spark plug electrodes at the appropriate 
time in the engine operating cycle. The onset of the 
arc across the spark plug gap is timed to occur at a 
predetermined number of degrees of crankshaft 
rotation, usually before the piston has reached top 
dead center (TDC). If the spark timing is properly set, the 
combustion process initiated by the spark plug action 
will cause a pressure increase to develop within the 
combustion chamber that will peak just shortly after 
TDC during the piston's power stroke. If the spark is 
initiated too late in the operating cycle (retarded  
 
timing), the pressure developed within the combustion 
chamber will not be efficiently converted by the engine 
into work. On the other hand, if the spark is 
initiated too early in the operating cycle (advanced 
timing), extremely high and potentially damaging 
pressures and temperatures may result. The pressure 
and temperature increases associated with advance 
timing are also not efficiently converted by the engine 
into a useful work output. Excessive advanced timing can also lead to 
the occurrence of several other types of combustion 
chamber phenomena. One such phenomena is auto-ignition 
of the end gases and another is pre-ignition. Auto-ignition is a condition where the end 
gases (the unburnt portion of the fuel-air mixture 
initially ignited by the movement of the flame front) 
explode spontaneously as a result of the cylinder 
temperature and pressure becoming too high for the type 
of fuel being burned in the engine. In response to the 
sudden release of energy, the cylinder temperature 
dramatically increases and the cylinder pressure 
fluctuates, alternately rising and falling, as a 
pressure wave travels back and forth across the 
combustion chamber. When caused by auto-ignition of 
the end gases, the rapid pressure and temperature 
fluctuations are seen to occur after TDC. If the rate 
at which energy is released through
