<ABSTRACT>
Method in which signals are sent by modulation of a carrier frequency and, on reception, in the frequency domain, the received signals are equalized (11) before making them pass again into the time domain in order to carry out recognition thereon (20), and in which the signals are demodulated after equalization, the phase errors of the signals ( epsilon k) are measured according to prior equalized signals, and complex phase rotation coefficients (e
<
j theta i
>
) are determined, serving for the equalization (18) of subsequent signals. Application to digital television.

Process for transmitting digital signals, wherein the signals are emitted by modulation of a
carrier frequency and, during reception, the signals received are equalised (11) in the

frequency domain before they are returned to the time domain in order to carry out the
recognition (20), characterised by the fact that, during the decision stage, in order to

recognise the signals after equalisation, phase errors of the signals (ε
k
) are measured
according to previous equalised signals and complex coefficients of phase rotation are

determined, serving to equalise (18) subsequent signals as well as to correct (21) the
phases of the subsequent time signals (y
i
(n)) after they have been equalised.
Process according to claim 1, wherein, for a block of signals, residual errors (e'
i
(n)) of the
signals which have just returned to the time domain (y
i
(n)) are determined, these errors are
configured in order to calculate a quadratic error (J(n)) which is passed into the frequency

domain (85) in order to apply (86) a group of corrections to modulation lines when the
modulated carrier is equalised.
Process according to claim 2, wherein the group of corrections is applied to the
modulation lines by multiplication by a coefficient (C
i
(n+1)) which is specific to each line
and is obtained by removing, from an earlier coefficient (C
i
(n)), a complex number
proportional to the frequency-domain error (E'
i
(n)) relative to the line concerned, and
proportional to a conjugate signal of a signal (X*
i
(n)) of a signal (X
i
(n)) representing the
line concerned just after Fourier transformation.
Process according to one of claims 1 to 3, wherein, by subtraction of a frequency (5) close
to that of the carrier and independent of the variations thereof, the carrier received is

transposed, before equalisation, to the proximity of a zero frequency.
Process according to one of claims 1 to 4, wherein, before emission, the signals to be
emitted are grouped (31) into blocks of a fixed size, which are each complemented (32) by

a circular pattern and, during reception, the equalisation in the frequency domain is applied 
to each block after the circular pattern has been removed (35) therefrom.
Process according to one of claims 1 to 4, wherein, during reception, the signals received
are grouped (43) into blocks of a fixed size (L) which, after conversion to digital data, are

each complemented, at one end, by a sequence of fixed size (N-L) of digital data of zero
value running over, in terms of time, onto an adjacent block and, after equalisation and

return to the time domain, the equalised data which are in the overlapping zones and the
equalised signals of the adjacent block which correspond thereto in terms of time are

added together (47) term by term.
Process according to one of claims 1 to 4, wherein, during reception, the signals are
grouped into blocks of fixed size (N) which partially overlap (N-L), before the equalisation

(54-56) is carried out on the blocks, and, after equalisation, those (N-L) of the equalised
signals which come from signals in the overlapping zone of two successive blocks are

eliminated (57).
Receiver for digital signals transmitted by modulation of a carrier, comprising decision
means (20) in order, according to the signals received, to take a decision relating to

recognition of emitted signals, comprising

calculation means (14, 16) to carry out a discrete direct Fourier transformation on the
signals received, providing a spectrum of signals of frequency lines of the modulated

carrier,
equalisation means (15) to equalise the line signals with each other in dependence upon
the propagation distortion estimated according to a reference signal,
the calculation means (14, 16) being arranged to apply a discrete inverse Fourier
transformation to the spectrum of equalised line signals and to supply the result thereof,

with respect to time, to the decision means (20),
 
characterised in that the decision means (20) include phase rotation means (21) arranged

to transmit, with phase rotation, the equalised time signals to means (22, 23) for measuring
phase errors (ε
k
) of the said signals with respect to reference signals (âk), the phase error
measuring means (22, 23) being arranged to control the equalisation means (15) and the

phase rotation means (21).
Receiver according to claim 8, wherein the decision means (20) comprise an accumulator
circuit (25) arranged in order, depending on the phase errors (ε
k
, u
k
), to address a memory
(26) containing a trigonometric table for regulating a digital multiplier circuit (21)

transmitting the said subsequent signals to a decision circuit (22) supplying the said errors
(ε
k
, u
k
).
Receiver according to one of claims 8 and 9, wherein the calculation means are arranged
(35) in order, before discrete direct Fourier transformation, to recognise the positions of

fixed-size blocks of received signals, each comprising a circular digital pattern, and in
order to remove the said pattern therefrom.
Receiver according to one of claims 8 and 9, wherein the calculation means are arranged
(43) to group the received signals into blocks of a fixed size (L) and in order, after

conversion into digital data, to complement (43) each one at one end with a sequence, of a
fixed size (N-L), of digital data of zero value running over, in terms of time, onto an

adjacent block, before applying the discrete direct Fourier transformation to the
complemented blocks, and in order to add together (47) term by term the equalised data

which are in the overlapping zones and the equalised signals of the adjacent block which
correspond thereto in terms of time.
Receiver according to one of claims 8 and 9, wherein the calculation means are arranged
(53) in order, before the discrete Fourier transformation, to group the received signals into

blocks of a fixed size (N) partially overlapping (N-L) in time, and in order, just after the
discrete inverse Fourier transformation, to eliminate (57) the signals obtained (N-L)

coming from received signals appertaining to two blocks.
