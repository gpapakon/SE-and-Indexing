<ABSTRACT>
The history of handover destinations is stored in
a handover history storage section 41a. Each time

handover is effected, the history of past five
consecutive handover destinations including the present

handover destination is determined on the basis of the
handover history storage section 41a. When any of the

handover destinations has been stored in the handover
history storage section 41a, the mobile station

recognizes its state to be in the steady state and
otherwise to be in the moving state. On the basis of

the result of the recognition, the mobile station
selects a search algorithm suitable for each state and

searches for a base station. This enables the best
base station to be searched for according to the state

of the mobile station, thereby reducing the power
consumption in the wait state, which lengthens the

battery service life.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a mobile radio
communication terminal device used in a cellular radio
communication system which forms cells as an automobile
telephone system, a portable telephone system, or a
radio communication LAN system does.In recent years, cellular radio communication
systems have been popularized. In the cellular radio
communication system, base stations are distributed
over a service area, each base station forms a radio
zone called a cell, and a base station and a mobile
station are connected by radio in each cell. In this
type of system, when the power supply of a mobile
station is turned on, the mobile station is first
synchronized with the nearest base station and then
connected to the latter. Thereafter, the process of
switching the base station to which the mobile station
is connected, what is called handover, is carried out
as the mobile station moves.For example, in a cellular radio communication
system using a CDMA (Code Division Multiple Access)
scheme complying with the U.S. TIA standard (IS-95A), 
when the power supply is turned on at a mobile station,
the mobile station tries to pick up the pilot signal
broadcast from a base station. It takes about one to
two seconds to pick up the pilot signal. This is where
the time is required most in the sequence for
establishing the system synchronization between the
mobile station and base station. Alter the pilot
signal has been picked up, the mobile station
establishes the PN code synchronization with the base
station and then switches the Walsh code, orthogonal
code, thereby receiving a sync channel transmitted from
the base station. After receiving the message
transmitted through the sync channel, the mobile
station demodulates it and stores the received message.
The message includes inherent information about the
base station and network.After having completed the synchronization
establishing sequence, the mobile station goes into the
wait state. In the wait state, the mobile station
causes the radio communication circuit section to
operate only in the receiving period for a slot where
the base station will possibly send a page message to
the mobile station and prevents the main clock from
being generated in the remaining period to disable the
radio communication circuit section. The disabled
state is called a sleep state. Such a battery saving
operation is called the slot mode operation, whereby 
the average drawn current of the mobile station is
reduced to lengthen the battery service life.In the wait state, the mobile
