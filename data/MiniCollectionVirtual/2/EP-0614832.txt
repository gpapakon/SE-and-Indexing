<ABSTRACT>
According to the method, the floor is slightly accelerated during outward strokes (runs) whilst it is greatly accelerated during return strokes so that the load resting on the floor (13) advances with it during each outward stroke whilst, during each return stroke, it remains in position or virtually in position. The apparatus implementing this method may, in particular, be used in a cargo container (1).
