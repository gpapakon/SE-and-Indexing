<ABSTRACT>
Described is a process for dyeing fibrous materials made of or containing wool with anionic dyes, characterised in that these materials are dyed in the presence of a wool preservative comprising at least one compound of the formula R-O-CH2-CH(OH)-CH2-Y (1
>
 where the variables are each as defined in the claims. The process makes available rub-fast level dyeings without deterioration in the quality of the wool.

A process for dyeing fibrous materials consisting
of or comprising wool with anionic dyes, which

comprises dyeing these materials in the presence of a
wool preservative comprising at least one compound of

the formula

R - O - CH

 - CH(OH) - CH
2
 - Y

where Y is halogen and R is

(a) the radical of a hydroxyl-containing ethylenically
unsaturated compound,
(b) the radical of a homo- or copolymer of
hydroxyl-containing ethylenically unsaturated monomers

with or without one or more comonomers,
(c) the radical of a mono-, di-, tri-, oligo- or
polysaccharide,
(d) the radical of a hydroxyl-containing C
1
-C
22
alkyl
compound,
(e) the radical of a polyglycerol derivative having a
molecular weight ≤ 50,000, or
(f) the radical of a polyglycol.
A process according to claim 1, wherein Y is
chlorine.
A process according to claim 1 or 2, wherein the
radical R contains one or more hydroxyl groups and

these are partly or wholly replaced by a radical of the
formula

where Y is halogen and x, y and z are each
independently of the others from 1 to 200.
A process according to either of claims 1 and 2,
wherein R is the radical of allyl alcohol,

hydroxypropyl or hydroxyethyl acrylate, hydroxypropyl
or hydroxyethyl methacrylate or dihydroxypropyl or

dihydroxyethyl maleate.
A process according to any one of claims 1 to 3,
wherein R is the radical of arabinose, xylose, ribose,

glucose, mannose, galactose, fructose, sucrose, milk
sugar, lactose, m
altose, raffinose, cellulose or
preferably starch.
A process according to claim 1 or 2, wherein R is
the radical of a monoalcohol, of a glycol or of a

higher alcohol.
A process according to any one of claims 1 to 3 or
6, wherein R is the radical of glycerol, diglycerol,

triglycerol, 1,1,1-tris(hydroxymethyl)propane,
erythritol, pentaerythritol, arabitol, sorbitol or

mannitol. 
A process according to any one of claims 1 to 3,
wherein R is the radical of a polyglycerol having a

molecular weight ≤ 5000.
A process according to any one of claims 1 to 3,
wherein R is the radical of a polyethylene glycol

having a molecular weight ≤ 1000.
A process according to any one of claims 1 to 9,
wherein the fibrous material consisting of or

comprising wool is dyed in the presence of 0.5 to 10%
by weight, based on the material to be dyed, of one or

more compounds of the formula (1).
A process according to any one of claims 1 to 10,
wherein the fibrous material consisting of or

comprising wool is dyed in the presence of a wool
preservative comprising one or more compounds of the

formula (1) and an organic mono-, di- or tricarboxylic
acid or a mineral acid.
A process according to any one of claims 1 to 11
for dyeing wool-polyester fibre blend materials by the

exhaust method.
