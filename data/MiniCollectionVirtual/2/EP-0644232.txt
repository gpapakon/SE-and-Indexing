<ABSTRACT>
Free radically curable rubbers are crosslinked 
with the aid of a free radical initiator and a co-curing 

agent, which is an acrylate or methacrylate 
ester of a hydroxybenzene or hydroxynaphthalene 

compound containing two or more hydroxyl groups, at 
least two of which are esterified. The rubbers which 

are used in the present invention are natural rubber 
and synthetic rubbers derived from a diene monomer. 

Preferred co-curing agents are acrylate and 
methacrylate esters of hydroxybenzene compounds in 

which the ester contains two or three acrylate or 
methacrylate groups per molecule. The amount of co-curing 

agent may be about 1 - 50 parts by weight per 
one hundred parts by weight of rubber (phr). 

Outstanding abrasion resistance and air oven aging are 
observed.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to free radically cured 
rubber employing a co-curing agent (or coagent) and 
more particularly to improved curing systems employing 
improved co-curing agents. Some of the most commonly used curing systems for 
curable polymers (including elastomers) are commonly 
classified as either sulfur curing systems or peroxide 
curing systems. Peroxide curing systems initiate 
crosslinking via free radical mechanisms, using as the 
curing agent a compound which is frequently described 
as an organic peroxide. Advantages of peroxide curing 
systems include: ability to cause crosslinking in 
lower compression set, better chemical and oil 
resistance, less discoloration, and better color 
stability with less staining. Problems associated 
with peroxide curing systems include scorch (premature 
crosslinking) and poor aging performance. Coagents have been used in peroxide curing 
systems in order to ameliorate the disadvantages while 
capitalizing on the desirable characteristics of 
peroxide curing systems. By and large, these coagents 
are low molecular weight monomers and are usually 
either methacrylates, acrylates, cyanurates or 
isocyanurates. Coagents usually increase crosslink density, 
which results in an increase in the cure state of a 
peroxide cured elastomer. It is therefore often 
possible to lower the amount of peroxide required to 
achieve a given state of cure. A coagent typically  
 
does not affect the rate of cure. On the negative 
side, a coagent may reduce scorch time. Rubber & Plastics News, February 20, 1989, pages 
40 - 43, describes the use of organic peroxides for 
crosslinking elastomers. Various organic peroxides 
and peroxyketals are listed and discussed, as are 
representative polymers which can be crosslinked with 
the aid of an organic peroxide. This article also 
briefly discusses the effect of a coagent; among the 
coagents (or co-curing agents) mentioned is 
trimethylol propane trimethacrylate (TMPTMA). Rubber & Plastics News, September 2, 1991, pages 
37 - 40, is directed primarily to scorch safety in 
coagent cured elastomers. As stated therein, coagents 
are used to improve processability and to enhance the 
physical properties of peroxide-cured elastomers. 
Coagents are described as low molecular weight 
monomers which behave as reactive plasticizers and 
lower the viscosity of the compound mixture. This 
article notes that they increase crosslink density, 
thereby often lowering the amount of peroxide 
required. On the other hand, they do result in 
shor
