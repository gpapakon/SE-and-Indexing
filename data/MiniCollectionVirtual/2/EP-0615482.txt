<ABSTRACT>
A laser cutting apparatus (10) whereby the laser beam (11) is directed onto a cutting portion (13) of the workpiece (15), and a jet (18) of gas is guided, fully enclosed within solid walls, onto the cutting portion (13, 13a) in an inclined direction in relation to the beam (11) and at such a velocity as to control the fluid-thermodynamic effects caused by interaction with the beam (11) and with the material liquefied by the same, and to flush the liquefied material out of the cut (16) in steady, controlled manner. The jet (18) is supplied by means of a solid-walled conduit (21), the end portion of which conveniently presents an opening (37) enabling passage of the beam (11) onto the cutting portion (13, 13a).

<DESCRIPTION>
METHOD OF SUPPLYING LASER CUTTING GAS AND CUTTING APPARATUS IMPLEMENTING SUCH A METHODTECHNICAL FIELD The present invention relates to a method of supplying laser cutting gas, and a cutting apparatus implementing such a method. BACKGROUND ART Laser cutting, e.g. of metal plate, is usually performed with the aid of a jet of gas directed on to the cutting area for flushing out the liquefied material. The type of gas used depends on the wor piece material, and must be so selected as to prevent undesired chemical reactions affecting the cutting faces. It is particularly important to prevent the formation of products affecting the metallurgical structure of the cutting faces, and so resulting in hardness or fragility preventing post-process machining or actual use of the part, if no further machining is required. Oxygen is excellent for cutting ferrous materials (alloys), due to the exothermic reaction produced at high temperatures (over 720*C). If properly employed. 

 the energy and fluid-thermodynamic effects so produced may result in increased cutting speed for a given power of the laser, improved flushout of the liquefied material, and a better surface finish of the cutting faces.To understand the chain of events occurring in this process, some knowledge is required of the fluid-thermodynamics of reactive gases, and the complex phenomena produced when such a gas is subjected to intense heat by both the laser beam and the liquified material, and the mass of the gas stream is increased by the presence of the liquid. This results in a gas stream consisting of a mixture of compressible gas and (incompressible) liquid, with all the possibilities this entails. For example, the liquid may be broken down into large or small drops, or even atomized. Depending on the amount of heat, particularly that radiated by the laser beam and high-temperature solid or fluid surfaces, and the combined thermal and fluid-dynamic effects involved, the drops and atomized liquid particles may be converted into steam, which, though undesirable, is nevertheless inevitable. Moreover, due to their small size and the absence of a cooling mass (the cold faces of the workpiece), the liquid particles within range of the laser beam may also be converted into steam, which, like the existing steam, may be energized or even ionized by the laser beam, thus 

resulting in several of the luminous phenomena observed during the cutting process.In dealing with the above phenomena, the reactivity of the gas must also be taken into account. In the
