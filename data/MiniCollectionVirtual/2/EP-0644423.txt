<ABSTRACT>
The present invention relates to a measurement device, in particular for measuring the glucose level in blood, intended to be combined with a removable sensor comprising a plurality of active single-use zones. In particular, the invention relates to a cutting device (44,64,66,68,70) used for sectioning the removable sensor (52) introduced into the measurement device. The cutting device comprises a lever (44), a rod (66) and a blade (70) solidly attached to the lever.

Measurement arrangement, intended to be associated
with a multiple zone removable sensor (52) comprising a

cutting arrangement (50) for said multiple zone removable
sensor and characterized in that said cutting arrangement

includes a lever (44), a crank (66; 86) and a blade (70),
said lever performing a rotation around a first axle (46)

whenever it is actuated, said crank being mechanically
coupled to said lever and adapted to undergo a rotation

around a second axle (68) different from said first axle and
fixed to said lever, said blade being mechanically coupled

to said crank and arranged in the interior of a guide (74;
88) defining a predetermined path for such blade whenever

said lever is actuated, said measurement arrangement being
arranged in a manner such that said blade enables the

cutting of said multiple zone removable sensor placed within
said measurement arrangement whenever said lever is actuated

between an initial cutting position and a final cutting
position.
Measurement arrangement according to claim 1,
characterized in that said second axle (68) is parallel to

said first axle (46), said lever (44) having a dimension
greater than the distance provided between said first and

second axles in a plane perpendicular to said first and
second axles.
Measurement arrangement according to claim 1,
characterized in that said blade (70) is rigidly coupled to

said crank (66; 86).
Measurement arrangement according to claim 1,
characterized in that said path defined by said guide (74;

88) for said blade is substantially rectilinear.
Measurement arrangement according to claim 1,
intended to be associated with a multiple zone removable

sensor (52) of elongated form and substantially flat
defining a general plane (76) for such multiple zone

removable sensor and a cutting direction (78) for said blade
(70) in such general plane, such measurement arrangement 

being characterized in that said guide (74) is arranged in a
manner such that, when said multiple zone removable sensor

(52) is placed in said measurement arrangement, said path
defined by said guide between an initial cutting position of

the blade (70) and a final cutting position of said blade,
corresponding respectively to said initial cutting position

and final cutting position of said lever, determines a
travel direction (75) for said blade angularly offset

relative to said cutting direction (78).
Measurement arrangement according to any one of the
preceding claims, characterized in that said crank (86)

exhibits an elbow (92) arranged in a manner such that said
crank never intercepts said first axle (46).
Measurement arrangement according to any one of the
preceding claims, characterized in that said lever (44) is

constituted by a cover serving in addition to protect a
push-piece (58) serving for the advancing of said multiple

zone removable sensor (52).
Measurement arrangement according to claim 7,
characterized in that said cover (44) also serves to close

an orifice (96) serving for the introduction of the multiple
zone removable sensor (52) into the interior of measurement

arrangement.
Measurement arrangement according to any one of the
preceding claims, characterized in
 that said lever (44) can
undergo a rotation through an angle substantially equal to

180Â°.
Measurement arrangement according to any one of the
preceding claims, characterized in that such measurement

arrangement and said multiple zone removable sensor (52)
with which it is associated are arranged to measure the

proportion of glucose in the blood.
