<ABSTRACT>
Tough gels and elastomers are prepared using 
compositions curable by a hydrosilation reaction that are 

characterized by the presence of a chain extender 
containing two silicon-bonded hydrogen atoms per molecule 

and a cross-linking agent containing at least three 
silicon bonded hydrogen atoms or alkenyl radicals per 

molecule, with the proviso that the chain extender 
contains at least 80 percent of the silicon-bonded 

hydrogen atoms present in the composition or, when said 
cross-linking agent contains alkenyl radicals, said chain 

extender contains at least 80 percent of the total moles 
of silicon-bonded hydrogen and said alkenyl radicals.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to curable organosiloxane 
compositions of relatively low viscosity that yield tough 
gels and elastomers upon curing. Elastomeric silicone materials, particularly 
those containing fillers such as finely divided forms of 
reinforcing silica or quartz, exhibit high levels of 
physical properties, including tensile strength, modulus 
and tear strength, which make these materials desirable 
in a variety of end use applications. Toughness is desirable for gels and elastomers that 
are used as coating, potting and encapsulating materials 
in electrical and electronic applications. Toughness can 
be defined as a combination of tensile strength, tear 
resistance and the ability to be elongated without 
ripping or tearing. This combination of properties has 
also been referred to as flexibility. This property is 
desirable for materials so that they retain their 
integrity without cracking or crazing during repeated 
cycles of thermally induced expansion and contraction. In many instances, elastomer and gels used as 
coating in these end use applications must maintain 
adhesion to electronic devices, electrical components and 
printed circuit boards and to the electrical connectors 
or conductors that pass through the coating or 
encapsulating material. When the coating material 
expands due to inadequate toughness, the connectors and 
conductors can act as initiation points for tears or 
cracks which dissipate the stresses occurring during 
normal expansion and contraction. Organosiloxane elastomers and gels for electronic 
applications are typically prepared from compositions 
containing high molecular weight polyorganosiloxanes  
 
and/or high loadings of reinforcing fillers. The 
viscosity of these compositions is usually too high for 
coating and encapsulating intricately shaped substrates 
unless the compositions are diluted with solvents or 
applied by vacuum assisted techniques. The prior art is represented by US-A 5,145,933 and 
by US-A 4,340,709. Unexpectedly, this invention provides curable 
organosiloxane compositions that are sufficiently low in 
viscosity to be applied to substrates in the absence of 
solvents or diluents using conventional coating and 
encapsulating techniques. Yet, these compositons cure to 
yield tough elastomers and gels. In accordance with the present invention, tough gels 
and elastomers are prepared by a platinum-catalyzed 
hydrosilation reaction which are characterized by the 
presence of a chain extender containing two silicon-bonded 
hydrogen
