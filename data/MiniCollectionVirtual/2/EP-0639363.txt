<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a tampon (T) intended for feminine hygiene, consisting of a cylindrical blank which is produced by winding up a sliver-like fleece portion and which is shaped by being loaded with pressing force to produce a preform with a core of higher compaction of the fibre material and with core-surrounding longitudinal ribs of lower compaction and is ultimately shaped into the finished tampon (T) by the application of radial pressure forces on the longitudinal ribs. The invention relates, furthermore, to a process and an apparatus for the production of a tampon (T) of this type. In order, whilst maintaining the buckling resistance, to increase the absorbency, the core is formed by a region (Kr) of maximum compaction having an annular cross-section and by a central region (Kz) of medium compaction located within this annular region (Kr).

Tampon, in particular for feminine hygiene,
comprising a cylindrical blank which is produced by

winding up a section of nonwoven fabric in strip form
and, by applying pressing force to sections of its outer

surface evenly distributed over its circumference, is
transformed into a preform with a core of higher

compaction of the fibre material and longitudinal ribs of
lower compaction, surrounding the core, and is finally

formed into the finished tampon by applying radial
compressive forces to the longitudinal ribs,

characterized in that the core is formed by a cross-sectionally
annular region (Kr) of highest compaction and

a central region (Kz), lying within this annular region
(Kr), of moderate compaction.
Process for producing a tampon according to Claim
1 by forming the blank comprising wound-up nonwoven

fabric in strip form into a preform by applying pressing
forces to sections of its outer surface spaced apart from

one another and by final forming of the preform provided
with longitudinal ribs, by applying radial compressive

forces, characterized in that the pressing forces are
directed tangentially at a circular cylinder (10)

surrounding the longitudinal centre axis of the tampon at
a prescribed distance.
Apparatus for producing a tampon according to
Claim 1, having a number of pressing tools (9) for

compacting the blank (R) in the core region and for
producing longitudinal ribs in the outer surface region

and also having a forming tool for the final forming of 
the tampon, characterized in that the pressing tools (9)

are arranged respectively at the inner end of a lever (1)
which can be swivelled between two end positions about a

swivel axis (bearing bolt 2).
Apparatus according to Claim 3, characterized in
that each lever (
1) is mounted at its outer end via a
coupling lever (5) on a carrying ring (7) and can be

swivelled by an adjusting ring (3), at which the levers
(1) are respectively swivel-mounted by means of a bearing

bolt (2).
Apparatus according to Claim 3 or 4,
characterized in that each pressing tool (9) is arranged

replaceably on the lever (1).
Apparatus according to at least one of Claims 3
to 5, characterized in that each pressing tool (9) is

designed with a protruding pressing edge (9a).
