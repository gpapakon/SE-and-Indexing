<ABSTRACT>
An engaging member 4 includes a reinforcing projection 6 
and a notch portion 7. A recess 15 corresponding to the reinforcing 

projection 6 is formed in an inner wall 11 defining a 
deflection space 10. When the engaging member 4 is deflected, 

the reinforcing projection 6 is fitted in the recess 15. An 
excessive deflection of the engaging member 4 is prevented by 

the contact of a contact surface 8 of the notch portion 7 with 
the inner wall 11 of the deflection space 10. The strength of 

the engaging member 4 is assured by the presence of the reinforcing 
projection 6. Since the sufficient deflection margin of 

the engaging member 4 is assured by both the deflection space 10 
and the recess 15, a dimension of the deflection space 10 can be 

made smaller by the depth of the recess 11 in a connector 1 than 
in the prior art connector.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a connector formed with an engaging 
member for lockingly holding a terminal fitting. US-specification 5,240,434 concerns a connector which assures that clearance 
between an engagement projection of a flexible engagement piece projecting 
from the inner wall of each terminal accommodating chamber of a connector 
housing and an engagement hole of terminal is minimized and, moreover, each 
terminal is properly inserted into the corresponding terminal accommodating 
chamber with a higher intensity of engaging force. The connector includes a 
plurality of terminals each of which one end serves as an electrical contact 
portion having an engagement hole formed on a base plate and of which other 
end serves as a cable connecting portion. In addition, the connector includes a 
connector housing having a plurality of terminal accommodating chambers 
formed therein. A flexible engagement piece having an engagement projection 
formed at the foremost end thereof is projected from each terminal 
accommodating chamber, and the engagement projection serves as engaging 
means for allowing the engagement hole of the terminal to be engaged with the 
engagement projection. An upper surface is formed on the engagement projection 
while slantwise downwardly extending toward the cable connecting portion 
of the terminal. In addition, tapered portions are formed along ridge lines where 
the upper surface intersects both side surfaces. German utility model publication DE-U-86 21 150.1 provides an electrical 
multiple connector comprising an insulating housing having a connecting side 
and an opposite engaging side. The connection of these opposing sides is 
achieved by using flexible connecting tongues which are incorporated in both 
the insulated housing and the terminal fittings to be inserted therein.  
 An object of the invention is to provide a multiple connector of 
smaller size which is, nevertheless, capable of preventing an 
excessive deflection of an engaging member and to assure a sufficient 
deflection margin and strength of the engaging member 
and the wall portion. In order to solve the above problem, the invention as to claim 
1 is accomplished by a connector comprising a housing formed 
with a plurality of cavities incorporated in the housing, into 
which terminal fittings are to be inserted, each cavity having 
a deflectable engaging member and a deflecting space with an 
inner wall as a stop for permitting the engaging member to be 
deflected to a predetermined amount in a

<CLAIMS>
A multiple connector (1) comprising a housing (2) formed with: 

a plurality of cavities (3) incorporated in the housing, into which terminal 
fittings (20) are to be inserted, 
each cavity (3) having a deflectable engaging member (4) and a deflecting 
space (10) with an inner wall (11) as a stop for permitting the engaging 

member (4) to be deflected to a predetermined amount in a direction 
transverse to the terminal inserting direction (T), 
each engaging member (4) having a projection (5) on its leading end 
engaging with a corresponding terminal fitting (20) after insertion thereof, 

and 
each engaging member (4) being formed with a recess portion (7) in its 
surface, which is facing in the deflection direction, and wherein another 

recess portion (15) is formed in the inner wall (11) of the housing (2), so 
that the deflection space (10) is enlarged in the deflection direction. 
A multiple connector (1) ) according to claim 1 wherein the engaging members 
(4) being integrally lancelike formed with inner walls of that housing 

(2). 
A connector (1) according to claim 1 or 2, wherein the recess portion 
(15) in the inner wall (11) is a through hole (15) through the wall (12) 

separating two cavities (3, 3).  
 
A connector (1) according to claim 1, 2 or 3, wherein the recess portion 
in the surface of the engaging member (4) is formed by at least one notch 

portion (7) to leave a reinforcing projection (6) which project towards the 
deflection space (10), and wherein the recess portion in the inner wall 

(11) is suitable for taking up the reinforcing projection (6). 
A connector (1) according to claim 4, wherein the notch portion (7) is 
formed to have such a slanting surface as to come into contact, preferably 

fully, with the inner wall (11) of the housing (2) when the engaging 
member (4) is deflected to thereby cause the reinforcing projection (6) to 

be fitted in the recess portion (15).
