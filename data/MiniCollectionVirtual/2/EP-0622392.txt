<ABSTRACT>
Disclosed are crystalline poly(alkylene carbonates) that 
heretofore have not been made by polymerization of carbon dioxide 

and alkylene oxides such as ethylene and propylene oxides. Also 
disclosed is the crystallization of amorphous poly(alkylene 

carbonates) by stretching them. Further disclosed are (1) a high 
oxygen barrier, high clarity laminate resistant to delamination 

that has one layer comprising a low oxygen barrier, crystalline 
polymer, and an adherent adjacent layer comprising a crystalline 

poly(alkylene carbonate); and (2) a method for making the laminate 
from the polymer and the amorphous counterpart of the crystalline 

poly(alkylene carbonate).

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to synthetic resins, and in particular to 
high molecular weight, normally solid polymers of alkylene oxides 
and carbon dioxide. Such polymers are referred to in the art as 
poly(alkylene carbonates), and frequently in this specification as 
"PACs" or in the singular as "PAC". PACs have been known for many years, but have not achieved 
widespread commercial use for a number of reasons. One reason is 
that up to now those polymers made from the more readily 
commercially available alkylene oxides such as ethylene oxide and 
propylene oxide are amorphous. They have no definite melting 
points, and, compared to synthetic resins in general, have low 
glass transition temperatures and low decomposition temperatures. 
For example, the typical Tg of poly(ethylene carbonate), ("PEC"), 
of 50,000 number-average molecular weight is 10-28oC, and the 
typical Tg of poly(propylene carbonate), ("PPC"), of 50,000 
number-average molecular weight is 40oC. The typical decomposition 
temperature for PEC is 220oC, and for PPC ppc is 250oC. While 
these and other properties make these polymers useful as 
decomposable, mold patterns in the manufacture of articles by the 
casting of metals, and as sacrificial binders in the manufacture 
of articles by sintering molded ceramic and metallic powders, they 
also have limited the utility of these pacs.  The U.S. Patent, No. 3,706,713, to Hull et al. discloses 
compositions comprising polymers of carbon dioxide and one or more 
of aliphatic (including cycloaliphatic) 1,2-monoepoxides having at 
least four carbon atoms per molecule. The compositions are stated 
to be useful in moldings, films and fibers. The patent discloses 
that the polymers had crystallinity when made from cycloaliphatic 
epoxides, and very little crystallinity when made from isobutylene 
oxide. It is known that some crystalline polymers at temperatures in a 
range (depending on the polymer) below their melting points, but 
above normal room temperatures, can be stretched up to a point of 
breakage or failure, and, while maintaining them in the stretched 
condition, cooled to a temperature at which they will retain their 
stretched condition until heated to temperatures in that range or 
at or above their melting points. The resulting polymers, 
characterized by increased clarity and other physical properties 
including impact strength are described as oriented. If the 
stretching is only in one direction as, for example, in the plane 
of a film of such a polymer, the polymer or film is

<CLAIMS>
A crystalline poly(alkylene carbonate), the alkylene units of 
which are selected from the group consisting of C₂-C₈ acylic 

hydrocarbons and cyclopropylene without or with C₁-C₄ 
hydrocarbon substituents, which alkylene units can be the same 

or different. 
Crystalline poly(ethylene carbonate). 
Crystalline poly(propylene carbonate) 
A method for crystallizing an amorphous poly(alkylene 
carbonate), which comprises stretching it at a 

temperature above its glass transition temperature, but below 
its decomposition temperature, and preferably in the range of 

120-150oC, the extent of stretching being sufficient to cause 
substantial crystal formation. 
A high oxygen barrier, high clarity laminate having high 
resistance to delamination, which comprises at least two 

adjacent plys, the first of which consists essentially of a 
crystalline poly(alkylene carbonate), and the second of which 

consists essentially of a low oxygen barrier, crystalline 
polymer with said first ply being in direct adherence to the 

second ply. 
A laminate according to claim 5 in which said first ply is 
sandwiched between said second ply and a third ply consisting 

essentially of a crystalline polymer different from the 
crystalline poly(alkylene carbonate) with said first ply 

being in direct adherence to said third ply. 
A laminate according to claim 5 or 6 in which the crystalline 
polymer is crystalline polypropylene. 
A laminate according to claim 5, 6 or 7 in which the 
poly(alkylene carbonate) is crystalline poly(ethylene 

carbonate) or crystalline poly(propylene carbonate). 
A method for making a high oxygen barrier, high clarity, 
laminate having high resistance to delamination, which method 

comprises: 

(1) forming a laminate with at least two adjacent plys, 
the first of which consists essentially of an 

orientable crystalline polymer unoriented in the 
direction of at least one axis of the plane of the 

ply, and the second of which consists essentially of 
an amorphous poly(alkylene carbonate), said 

second ply being in direct adherence to the 
first ply; 
(2) with the temperature of the first ply being in the 
range in which the polymer is orientable, but below 

the decomposition temperature of the amorphous 
poly(alkylene carbonate), stretching the laminate in 

at least said direction until the crystalline 
polyolefin ply has become oriented in that direction, 

whereby the amorphous poly(alkylene carbonate) becomes 
crystalline; and 
(3) while maintaining the crystalline polymer in its 

stretched condition, cooling the laminate to a 
temperature at which the crystalline polymer 

retains its orientation. 
A method according to claim 9 in which said second ply is 
sandwiched between said first ply and a third ply consisting 

essentially of an orientable crystalline polymer unoriented in 
at least said direction, and with said second ply being in 

direct adherence to said third ply. 
A method according to claim 10 in which each of the first and 
third crystalline polymer plies of the laminate of step (1) is 

unoriented in both the X and Y axes of the ply, and in step 
(2) the laminate is stretched in the directions of both said 

axes until each polymer ply has become biaxially oriented, and 
in which the orientable crystalline polymer in both the first 

and third plies is preferably crystalline polypropylene, and 
the poly(alkylene carbonate) is preferably poly(ethylene 

carbonate) or poly(propylene carbonate).
