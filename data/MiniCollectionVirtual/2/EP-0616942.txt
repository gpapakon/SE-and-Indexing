<ABSTRACT>
A bag maker-packaging machine uses three heaters 
(42,51,52) to make bags, one for longitudinal sealing and 

two for transverse sealing. A device for automatically 
setting the temperatures of these three heaters includes a 

memory (12) which stores temperature data from which an 
operator can retrieve a standard temperature, to which the 

longitudinal seal heater (42) is to be set, by specifying 
the characteristics of the material to be used for making 

bags. Different temperatures, to which the two transverse 
seal heaters (51,52) are to be set, are uniquely determined 

on the basis of the standard temperature. The standard 
temperature and the other temperatures thus determined may 

be displayed in different ways on one or more display 
devices.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a new device for setting 
temperatures of sealers for sealing thermoplastic film pieces 
together by heating them, as well as a combined bag maker and 
packaging machine (hereinafter simply referred to as a 
packaging machine) provided with such a new device. A packaging machine of the so-called vertical pillow type, for 
example, is adapted to transport an elongated web of 
thermoplastic bag-making material (hereinafter referred to as 
a film) over a device called a former so as to bend it into a 
tubular form, to seal its mutually overlapped side edges 
longitudinally together while it is being transported along 
the circumferential surface of a loading cylinder (also 
referred to as a mandrel), and to simultaneously seal the top 
part of a bag and the bottom part of the next bag below the 
loading cylinder. For such an operation, the packaging 
machine requires a total of three heaters including a 
longitudinal seal heater for joining the side edges together 
and a pair of transverse seal heaters for sandwiching the film 
therebetween from both front and back directions.  
 Although the longitudinal seal heater is used to seal film 
pieces together where their total thickness hardly changes, 
the same is not true with the transverse seal heaters because 
the total thickness of the film pieces sandwiched therebetween 
is necessarily greater where the side edges are longitudinally 
overlapped one on top of the other. Since the film pieces 
must be sealed completely and dependably, the transverse seal 
heaters are generally set at higher temperature than the 
longitudinal seal heater. Of the pair of transverse seal 
heaters, furthermore, the front heater is set at a high 
temperature than the back heater because the front heater 
serves to heat and seal the longitudinally overlapped parts 
directly. The temperatures for these heaters are usually set by an 
operator with reference to thermometers displaying the actual 
temperatures of the heaters and by rotating control knobs or 
the like, corresponding to the material characteristics and 
size of the film and also by taking other operating conditions 
into account. Since this temperature-setting operation is an 
extremely cumbersome routine, there was always a high 
probability of operational errors.  
 In accordance with the present invention, a heater 
control device for controlling the temperatures of heaters 
of a bag maker-packaging machine comprising three heaters

A heater control device for controlling the 
temperatures of heaters of a bag maker-packaging machine 

comprising three heaters including a longitudinal heater 
(42) for sealing elongated film pieces longitudinally and 

front and back transverse heaters (51,52) for sealing said 
film pieces transversely, the device comprising: 


memory means (12) for storing temperature data 
corresponding to different kinds of bag-making materials; 
standard setting means (14) for retrieving from said 
memory means (12) a data item corresponding to a specified 

kind of bag-making material, said retrieved data item 
serving as a standard temperature for a specified one of 

said three heaters; and 
temperature setting means (15) for uniquely 
determining two temperature values individually for the 

other two of said three heaters from said standard 
temperature. 
A device according to claim 1, wherein said 
temperature setting means (15) determines said two 

temperature values by adding or subtracting predetermined 
differential temperature values to or from said standard 

temperature. 
A device according to claim 1 or claim 2, further 
comprising input means (21) for allowing an operator to 

select said specified kind of bag-making material. 
A device according to any of the preceding claims, 
further comprising display means (22) for displaying at 

least either said standard temperature or said two uniquely 
determined temperature values. 
A device according to any of claims 1 to 3, further 
comprising first display means (22a) for displaying said 

standard temperature by receiving a temperature signal from 
said standard setting means (14) and second display means 

(22b) for displaying said two uniquely determined 
temperature values by receiving temperature signals from 

said temperature setting means (15).  
 
A bag maker-packaging machine comprising three heaters 
including a longitudinal heater (42) for sealing elongated 

film pieces longitudinally and front and back transverse 
heaters (51,52) for sealing said film pieces transversely, 

and a heater control device according to any of the 
preceding claims. 
A machine according to claim 6, wherein said standard 
setting means (14) further serves to adjust the temperature 

of said specified one of said three heaters to said 
standard temperature. 
The device of claim 6 or claim 7, wherein said 
temperature setting means (15) further serves to adjust the 

temperatures of said other two heaters according 
individually to said uniquely determined two temperature 

values. 
A machine according to any of claims 6 to 8, wherein 
said specified one of said heaters is the longitudinal 

heater (42). 
A machine according to any of claims 6 to 9, further 
comprising: 


a loading cylinder (35) for causing articles to pass 
therethrough to be packaged in bags; 
a film supporting means (31) for supporting a roll of 
bag-making material; 
pulling means (36) for pulling said bag-making 
material from said roll; 
a former (32) for forming said bag-making material 
into a tubular shape around said loading cylinder; and 

film guiding means (33) for guiding said bag-making 
material to said former, wherein the longitudinal heater 

(42) seals side edges of said tubularly formed bag-making
