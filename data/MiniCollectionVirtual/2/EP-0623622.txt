<ABSTRACT>
A process for producing a cephem compound represented by general formula (3) which comprises reacting an allenyl-β-lactam 
compound represented by general formula (1) with an organotin compound represented by general formula (2) in the 

presence of a copper salt, wherein R¹ represents hydrogen, halogen or optionally protected amino; R² represents hydrogen, 
halogen, lower alkoxy, lower acyl, lower alkyl which may be substituted by optionally protected hydroxy, or optionally protected 

hydroxy, provided that R¹ and R² may be combined together to represent =O; R³ represents hydrogen or a carboxyl-protecting 
group; R⁴ represents an aryl or nitrogenous aromatic heterocyclic group each of which may be substituted; and m 

represents 0 or 2; (R⁵)n-Sn(R⁶)₄₋n (2), wherein R⁵ represents an alkenyl, aryl or nitrogenous aromatic heterocyclic group 
each of which may be sustituted; R⁶ represents lower alkyl; and n represents 1 or 2; and formula (3) wherein R¹, R², R³ and 

R⁵ are each as defined above.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a process for
preparing cephem compounds having a broad antibacterial
spectrum.The Wittig reaction is already known as a process
for preparing 3-alkenyl cephem compounds (e.g., JP-A-120288/1991,
JP-A-307885/1988).Also known as a process for preparing 3-alkenyl, 3-aryl
and 3-heterocyclic cephem compounds is the process
wherein a cephem compound having an elimination group L (such
as fluorosulfonyloxy group or trifluoromethylsulfonyloxy
group) at the C(3)- position is reacted with an organotin
compound in the presence of a palladium catalyst (JP-A-220195/1991
and JP-A-313483/1989).These processes each use a compound having a cephem
skeleton as the starting material and have problems, for
example, in respect of the economy of the material or the
number of steps involved in preparing the material.Further a report was recently made on a process for
preparing 3-alkenyl or 3-aryl cephem compounds, i.e., a
process wherein an allenyl-β -lactam compound found by us
(Torii et al., Synlett, 1991, 888), represented by the general
formula (1) and serving as the starting material is reacted 
with an organocopper reagent prepared in advance from an
organotin compound and dimethyl cuprate, or an organolithium
compound and cuprous iodide, or a Grignard reagent and cuprous
iodide [Kant et al., Tetrahedron Letters, 33 (25), 3563
(1992)]. This process affords the desired cephem compound from
an inexpensive penicillin compound by a short reaction step.
With this process, however, the reaction must be conducted at
an extremely low temperature (-100 to -78 °C ) which is
industrially infeasible, further produces an undesirable 2-cephem
compound as a by-product and encounters difficulty in
purifying the desired product.An object of the present invention is to provide a
novel process for preparing various cephem compounds having a
broad antibacterial spectrum from an allenyl-β -lactam
compound easily by a simplified reaction procedure under
reaction conditions which can be industrially realized with
ease, the lactam compound being readily available from an
inexpensive penicillin compound by a short reaction step.The present invention provides a process for
preparing a cephem compound represented by the general formula
(3) characterized in that an allenyl-β -lactam compound
represented by the general formula (1) is reacted with an
organotin compound represented by the general formula (2) in
the presence of a monovalent copper salt
 
wherein R1 is a hydrogen atom, halogen atom, amino or
protected
