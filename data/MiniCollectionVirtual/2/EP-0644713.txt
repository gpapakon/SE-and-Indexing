<ABSTRACT>
A solder-precoated wiring board on which devices and component can be mounted at fine pitches and which can be manufactured 
with a high productivity. A solder layer on a conductor for connection of electronic components on the wiring board 

comprises an Sn thin film layer formed by, for example, Cu-Sn substitution reaction on the basis of forming a Cu-complex of thiourea, 
and a Pb-coated Sn layer made by forming an Sn film, forming Sn crystalline particles film by Sn disproportionating reaction 

based on selective deposition on the Sn film, and substituting Pb for at least part of the Sn crystalline particles by Sn-Pb substituting 
reaction on the basis of the ionization tendency. It is desirable to melt this solder layer, and then, cool it to form an 

alloyed layer.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a solder-precoated
conductor circuit substrate and a method of producing
the same, and more particularly to a solder-precoated
conductor circuit substrate capable of mounting
components in a high packaging density and having an
excellent productivity and a method of producing the
same.Recently, conductor circuit substrate for
mounting electronic components such as IC, LSI and the
like are demanded to have a fine pattern with the
miniaturization and high densification of these
electronic components. For this purpose, a more
precision is required even in the connection of surface
mounting components to the conductor circuit substrates.As a technique of connecting the surface
mounting component to the conductor circuit substrate, 
there is widely used a soldering method, particularly a
reflow soldering method with a high productivity. This
method is a technique in which a solder paste is
previously supplied onto a copper foil (pad) located on
a surface of a printed circuit substrate and a surface
mounting component is positioned and mounted thereonto
and thereafter the resulting assembly is placed in a
heating furnace (reflow furnace) to melt the solder for
the connection.(a) In this technique, molten solder plating
method, solder paste printing method, electrolytic
solder plating method, electroless solder plating method
and the like are adopted as a method for supplying a
solder for surface mounting onto the pad of the
conductor circuit substrate.However, these solder supplying methods have
the following problems for conducting the surface
mounting of fine pitch.
1 ○ In the molten solder plating method, it is difficult
to control the plating thickness and the uniform plated
film is not obtained.2 ○ In the solder paste printing method, the limit of
pitch width capable of supplying the solder is 0.3 mm
and the narrowing of the pitch can not be conducted.3 ○ In the electrolytic solder plating method, a lead
for voltage application is required and hence the steps
become complicated and the degradation of pattern wiring 
density is caused.4 ○ In the electroless solder plating method, the
formation of plated film is a substitution reaction with
copper and it is difficult to increase the thickness of
the film.Furthermore, there is a method in which Sn
film and Pb film formed on the pad of the conductor
circuit substrate through plating is alloyed to feed a
solder for surface mounting as the other method of
supplying the solder (JP-A-2-101190 and JP-A-4-21795).
According to this method,
