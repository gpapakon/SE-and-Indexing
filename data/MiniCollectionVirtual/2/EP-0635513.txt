<ABSTRACT>
Neoalkyl alkylidene-2,2'-bisphenyl phosphite 
esters are provided. The phosphites exhibit 

enhanced thermal and hydrolytic stability, and 
are useful as additives in thermoplastic resin 

compositions to enhance the thermal oxidative 
stability thereof.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to thermoplastic resin
compositions stabilized with phosphites, and more
particularly cyclic biphenyl phosphites.Cyclic biphenyl and bisphenyl monophosphites
and their use as stabilizers in thermoplastic
compositions are known, see Haruna U.S. Patent
4,885,326 and Spivack U.S. Patent 4,351,759,Many of these cyclic bisphenyl and biphenyl
monophosphites experience less than desirable
levels of thermal and/or hydrolytic stability.Consequently, there is a need to provide
cyclic bisphenyl and biphenyl phosphites that
exhibit enhanced levels of thermal and/or
hydrolytic stability. US-A-4288391 discloses alkylated 1,1'-biphenyl-2,2'diyl
phosphites obtained by reacting alkylated 2,2'-biphenol
with phosphorous trichloride in an organic
solvent and then reacting the intermediate with an
alcohol or thiol. The phosphites are useful as
stabilizers of organic polymers and lubricating oils,
especially as process stabilizers for polyolefins,
elastomers, polyesters and polycarbonates.WO 85/03702 discloses transition metal-diorganophosphite
complex catalyzed carbonylation
processes, especially hydroformylation, transition metal-diorganophosphite
ligand complex compositions, diorganophosphite
ligands and transition metal-diorganophosphite
catalysts.The present invention provides a thermoplastic resin
composition comprising:
(a) a polyolefin resin; and(b) a phosphite, which is present in a thermal
stabilizing amount wherein said phosphite is of
the formula:

wherein R3 is selected from the group consisting of
radicals represented by the following formulae:
-CH1, -CH2-O-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3,The phosphites used in the present invention are
selected from the following:

and
The compound can be obtained by allowing, for
example, phosphorous trichloride to react with
2,2'-alkylidenebisphenol into a compound which 
will then be allowed to react with an alcohol
represented by

where
R3 is selected from the group consisting of:
-CH3, -CH2-O-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3
and
each R2 is a methyl group.Thermoplastic compositions containing a
polyolefin resin and an amount of the phosphite can be
made by blending. The phosphites are effective
antioxidants which may be employed in a wide range of
olefin polymers.
Polymers which can be stabilized include:
1. Polymers which are derived from mono- or
diolefins, e.g., polyethylene which can
optionally be crosslinked, polypropylene,
polyisobutylene, polymethylbutene-1,
polymethylpentene-1, polyisoprene,
polybutadiene.2. Mixtures of the homopolymers cited under
(1), for example
