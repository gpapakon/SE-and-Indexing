<ABSTRACT>
A synchronizing circuit (SC) is proposed which 
recovers from input data (ID) applied thereto a data clock 

signal (DC) synchronous therewith in frequency and in phase. 
The circuit (SC) consists of a tuned tapped delay 
line (TDL) generating a plurality of mutually delayed local 

clock signals (DCS), a latching circuit (LC) sampling these 
delayed local clock signals at input data level transitions 

thereby providing sampled versions (LCSV) thereof as well as 
a comparator (C1) pairwise comparing said delayed local clock 

signals with respective ones of the sampled versions. 
It can be verified that with such a circuit the 
level transitions of the appropriate data clock signal (DC) 

are generated at the outputs of the comparator (C1) when the 
latter drives its output high only if a sufficient number of 

its pairwise comparisons hold.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention,as specified in a first part of the preamble of claim 1, relates to a synchronizing circuit including a clock
phase adjustment means adapted to be triggered by input data level transitions of input
data applied to said synchronizing circuit in order to phase adjust a local clock signal,
the synchronizing circuit is adapted to provide a data clock signal with clock signal level transitions
aligned to said input data level transitions.Such a synchronizing circuit is already known in the art from the article
"A 660 Mbit/s CMOS clock recovery circuit with instantaneous locking for NRZ data and
burst-mode transmission", by M. Banu et al., ISSCC '93, digest of technical papers, pp.
102-103, IEEE.In this known synchronizing device the clock phase adjustment means
comprises two voltage controlled oscillators alternately started and stopped by the level
transitions in the input data, as shown in Figure 1 of the article. In this way the output
signals of the oscillators constitute phase shifted versions of the local clock signal, called
"External Reference Frequency". This frequency is accurately reproduced in these output
signals thanks to the depicted mechanism involving the use of a phase locked loop and a
third voltage controlled oscillator matched to the previous two. The OR'ing of the above
outputs then verifiably leads to the data clock signal having a correct phase, i.e. having
level transitions aligned to those of the input data.As argued in the article, in high-speed burst-mode applications commonly
associated to the emergence of ATM or Asynchronous Transfer Mode technology, such
an open-loop approach for recovering the data clock signal is preferable over
conventional closed loop circuits, such as phase locked loops, since the latter are
characterized by a locking delay and require a high input data level transition density to
remain in the locked condition. By using the above open-loop strategy these problems
are avoided as recovery of the data clock phase is performed instantaneously at the
occurrence of 
an input data level transition, whilst the accuracy of the ratio of the local clock signal
and input data frequencies ensures that a loss of phase synchronism before occurrence of
a new input data level transition is highly unlikely.However, the known implementation of this open-loop approach has a
number of drawbacks particularly with respect to integrated circuit or IC technology.
Indeed, the described circuit requires three matched voltage controlled oscillators since
