<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a gas detecting method and apparatus. More
particularly, the invention relates to a method of selectively detecting a fuel gas
having methane as a main component thereof and an incomplete combustion
gas having carbon monoxide as a main component thereof, and to a gas detecting
apparatus for use in executing this method. The invention employs a low heat
capacity, hot-wire semiconductor type gas sensor having an oxide semiconductor
formed mainly of tin oxide and acting as a sensitive section thereof.Conventional semiconductor gas sensors for selectively detecting different
types of gases as noted above are disclosed in Japanese Utility Model Publication
No. 1993-32760 and Japanese Patent Abstract (PAJP), vol. 16,
no. 427 (P-1416) 8 Sept. 1992 & JP-A-04 147 048, 20 May 1992.The former gas sensor is intended to detect carbon monoxide as incomplete
combustion gas, and methane, butane and the like as fuel gas. This sensor
detects the incomplete combustion gas at a relatively low temperature in the
order of 80°C, and the fuel gas at a high temperature in the order of 400°C. The
sensor includes a sensitive section formed of an oxide semiconductor having tin
oxide as a main component thereof. The sensitive section has a sensitizer such
as palladium added thereto to increase its sensitivity. The fuel gas may be
detected in a relatively short time (20 to 30 sec.), but a relatively long time of at
least 90 sec. is required for detecting carbon monoxide.The latter gas sensor is similar to the former in the object of detecting gases.
The latter has relatively high temperature ranges of detection (the sensitive
section becoming 300°C when detecting an incomplete combustion gas, and 
500 to 600°C when detecting a fuel gas). The sensitive section of this sensor is
formed of a metallic oxide semiconductor having tin oxide as a main component
thereof, with a trace of platinum added thereto to adjust its sensitivity.This sensitive section has a small outside diameter not exceeding lmm, and
the sensor itself has a relatively low heat capacity, to realize a shortened response
time.However, the conventional sensors noted above have the following drawbacks.The gas sensor disclosed in Japanese Utility Model Publication No. 1993-32760
has a peak of sensitivity to carbon monoxide at a temperature below 90°C. This
gas sensor has selectivity for a fuel gas only in a low temperature range of 40 to
80°C.In such a temperature range, therefore, some time is required for the sensor
to adsorb carbon monoxide and
