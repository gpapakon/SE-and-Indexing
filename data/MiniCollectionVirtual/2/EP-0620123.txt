<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method and
apparatus for erasing, from the recording surface of a
recording medium, a recording agent composed of a near
IR erasable dye, such as an aqueous ink, an oily ink, a
toner, etc.In recent years, interest in the use of near IR
erasable dyes as dyes for recording paper used in
various printers, copying machines, etc has increased.
This is because such dyes can make possible the
repeated reuse of the recording paper, and this can
contribute to the conservation of forest resources. As
disclosed in, for example, Japanese Unexamined Patent
Publication (Kokai) No. 4-362935, a near IR erasable
dye is a complex compound of a near IR absorbing
cationic dye - boron anion. This compound is
decomposed by irradiation of near infrared rays (a
wavelength of 700 nm or more) to become a transparent
substance. However, the compound is relatively stable
under visible rays. Accordingly, it is possible to
utilize it as a recording agent in various printers
etc., for example, various dyes of inks and toners.
The recording agent on the recording paper can be
decomposed and erased by the irradiation of the agent
with near infrared rays, thereby making reuse of the
recording paper possible.So as to achieve an enhancement of the efficiency
of reuse of recording paper, it is necessary quickly
and effectively to carry out processing for
decomposition of the near IR erasable dye, that is,
processing for erasing the recording agent. The
decomposition of the near IR erasable dye is promoted
under the presence of an appropriate catalyst, for
example, tetrabutyl ammonium butyl triphenyl borate.
In the above-mentioned Japanese Unexamined Patent
Publication (Kokai) No. 4-362935, an ink or toner is
proposed as the recording agent composed of the near IR 
erasable dye and the catalyst (sensitizing agent).
Such a near IR erasable dye included in the recording
agent is smoothly decomposed due to the catalyst, when
irradiated with near infrared rays. Therefore, a quick
erasure of the recording agent, that is, an enhancement
of the efficiency of reuse of the recording paper, can
be achieved.Natural light or room light includes light having
a wavelength of 700 nm or more, and therefore when
recording paper which is recorded by a catalyst-containing
recording agent is left to stand for a long
period, the recording density on the recording paper,
that is, the printing density, is gradually lowered due
to the action of the catalyst. Therefore, there arises
a problem with the persistency of such a
