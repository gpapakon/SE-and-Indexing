<ABSTRACT>
This invention relates to improved wound 
dressings that are adapted to being readily sized to 

fit the shape of the wound so that healing is 
promoted. In particular, the present invention is 

directed to a scored spiral wound dressing. More 
particularly, this invention relates to a spiral 

wound dressing having superior absorption properties 
and which is capable of swelling in the presence of 

wound fluid to closely fit the wound. 
The dressing can be trimmed by tearing along 

the score line to form a strand or rope.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to improved wound
dressings that are adapted to being readily sized to
fit the shape of the wound so that healing is
promoted. In particular, the present invention is
directed to a scored spiral wound dressing. More
particularly, this invention relates to a spiral
wound dressing having superior absorption properties
and which is capable of swelling in the presence of
wound fluid to closely fit the wound.It is recognized that providing a dressing
that promotes healing without scab formation is
desirable in wound treatment. In addition, the
removal of excess wound exudates is important to
promote wound healing and to prevent the breakdown of
skin surrounding the wound due to maceration.Many different types of dressings are
commercially available. These commonly include
dressings containing gauze, foams, sponges, cotton,
wools or other fibrous materials. Gauze and other
fibrous materials, while capable of absorbing wound
exudate can create problems in wound care because of
the tendency of these fibrous materials to be
engulfed or entrapped by the newly formed tissue that
grows into the dressing. As a result, when these
fibrous wound dressings are removed newly formed
tissues can be damaged and torn. The other commonly
used materials for removing exudates in wound 
dressings include granules and pastes. Similarly,
these are frequently difficult to remove from the
wound after hydration by the exudate and typically
require flushing with a liquid. Further, these
materials are limited in the amount of exudate they
can absorb.U. S. Patent No. 4,551,490 describes an
adhesive composition useful with ostomy and
incontinent appliances and which has also been used
in adhesive bandages. The composition consists of a
homogeneous mixture of polyisobutylene, styrene
random or block-type copolymer, mineral oil, soluble
hydrocolloid gum, water swellable cohesive
strengthening agent and a tackifier. This
composition has limited exudate absorption capacity
and requires a tackifier for its intended use as an
adhesive composition.U. S. Serial No. 990,719 filed December 15,
1992
corresponding to EP 0 689 425
which is commonly owned by the assignee of the
present invention teaches improved wound fillers
having high absorption capabilities. The wound
filler is preferably comprised of from about 25% to
75% by weight of a polymer matrix and 25% to 75% by
weight absorbing powers.European Patent Application No. 547 833 concerns a wound dressing in the
form of a rope or strand. The wound dressing comprises a
</DESCRIPTION>
<CLAIMS>
A wound dressing comprising a wound exudate absorbent
dressing material characterised in that the dressing is in the

form of a wafer (10) having at least one area of weakness (11) along a
surface which enables a rope (12) of the wound exudate absorbent

dressing material to be separated from the remainder of the
wafer.
The wound dressing according to claim 1 characterised in
that said area of weakness is a score line.
The wound dressing according to claim 2 characterised in
that said score line forms a spiral.
The wound dressing according to claim 3 characterised in
that said wafer is swellable to at least twice its original size.
The wound dressing according to claim 4 characterised in
that said dressing swells to about 2 to 4 times its original

size.
The wound dressing according to claim 5 characterised in
that said rope retains its cross-section upon swelling.
The wound dressing of claim 1 characterised in that the
dressing material does not increase in size upon absorption of

exudate.
The wound dressing of claim 1 characterised in that the
dressing material is a foam. 
The wound dressing according to claim 6 characterised in
that said rope is rectangular in cross-section.
The wound dressing according to claim 5 characterised in
that said dressing's moisture absorbency is at least 300% by

weight.
The wound dressing according to claim 10 characterised in
that said dressing is comprised of about 25% to about 75% by

weight of absorbing powders.
The wound dressing according to claim 11 characterised in
that said dressing is comprised of about 35% to 50% polymeric

matrix and from 50% to about 65% absorbing powders.
The wound dressing according to claim 12 characterised in
that said polymeric matrix comprises from about 15% to about 75%

of a styrene copolymer, about 5% to about 40% by weight of at

least one polyisobutylene and from about 5% to about 40% of a
plasticiser.
The wound dressing according to claim 12 characterised in
that said absorbing powder is selected from alginates, cross-linked

sodium carboxymethyl cellulose, absorbent polyacrylates
and water soluble hydrocolloids, or mixtures thereof.
The wound dressing according to claim 13 characterised in
that said styrene copolymer is styrene-butadiene-styrene.
The wound dressing according to claim 13 characterised in
that said styrene copolymer is styrene-isoprene-styrene. 
The wound dressing according to claim 13 characterised in
that said plasticiser is mineral oil.
The wound dressing according to claim 14 characterised in
that said dressing has been irradiated.
The wound dressing according to claim 14 characterised in
that said alginate is sodium alginate.
The wound dressing according to claim 14 characterised in
that said alginate is calcium alginate.
The wound dressing according to claim 1 characterised in
that said rope separated from the remainder of said wafer is

excess to be trimmed from said wafer to permit said wafer to be
sized to fit the shape of a wound.
The dressing of claim 1 characterised in that said
absorbent material swells to increase its outer dimensions upon

absorption.
