<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to bleaching in
laundry applications including hand washing as well as washing
with automatic washing machines.Liquid bleaching compositions are well-known in the art. Amongst the
different bleaching compositions available, those relying on bleaching by
hypochlorite are often preferred, mainly for performance reasons.
Representative of the art is, for example, WO-A-8805461 which discloses an
aqueous composition comprising hypochlorite, sodium carbonate and sodium
hydroxide and the use of said composition for removing stains from the
fabrics.However, the drawbacks associated with the use of chlorine-based
compositions are that said compositions may both damage and yellow the
fabrics. It is therefore an object of the present invention to provide a hypochlorite-containing
composition, suitable for use in laundry, whereby the fabric
whiteness is improved.It is a further object of the present invention to provide a hypochlorite-containing
composition, suitable for use in laundry, whereby fabric safety is
improved.We have now found that the previous objects can be met by formulating alkaline
hypochlorite bleach compositions comprising an alkali metal hypochlorite,
an alkali metal salt of silicate, preferably a strong source of alkalinity and optionally an
alkali metal salt of carbonate. Said compositions allow to provide
outstanding fabric whiteness as well as outstanding fabric safety on the
fabrics treated therewith. In its broadest aspect, the present invention is
based on the surprising finding that, in any given aqueous composition
comprising an alkali metal hypochlorite, the use of an alkali metal salt of silicate
will improve both the fabric whiteness by reducing the yellowing caused by hypochlorite and the fabric safety by reducing the fabric damage caused by hypochlorite on the fabrics
bleached therewith.A further advantage of the compositions in the present invention is that on
top of their outstanding whitening action and fabric safety properties said
compositions allow also good stain removal, in particular enzymatic stain
removal.Compositions comprising hypochlorite, a carbonate salt, a silicate salt and a
strong source of alkalinity have been described in the art.
Co-pending European patent application number 93870070.5 (publication number 0622451)
compositions comprising hypochlorite, sodium hydroxide, a bleach stable
perfume and as a buffering system, sodium carbonate and/or sodium silicate. EP-A-311 175 to Unilever discloses a liquid sanitizer composition
</DESCRIPTION>
<CLAIMS>
The use of an alkali metal salt of silicate, in an aqueous composition
having a pH of from 9 to 14 and comprising an alkali metal hypochlorite

and, preferably, a strong source of alkalinity, for improving the whiteness
of fabrics bleached herewith by reducing the yellowing caused by

hypochlorite.
The use according to claim 1 for further reducing the fabric damage
caused by hypochlorite.
A use according to claims 1 or 2 wherein said strong source of alkalinity
is an alkali metal hydroxide, preferably sodium hydroxide and wherein

the pH is of from 9 to 14.
A use according to any of the preceding claims wherein said composition
comprises from 2% to 10% by weight of the total composition, based on

active chlorine, of hypochlorite.
A use according to any of the preceding claims wherein said composition
comprises from 0.02% to 5% by weight of the total composition of an

alkali metal salt of silicate, preferably of from 0.1% to 2% and more
preferably of from 0.2% to 1.6% and wherein said alkali metal salt of

silicate is preferably sodium silicate.
A use according to any of the preceding claims wherein said composition
comprises from 0.1 % to 4% by weight of the total composition of an alkali

metal salt of carbonate, preferably of from 0.1% to 3% and wherein said
alkali metal salt of carbonate is preferably sodium carbonate.
