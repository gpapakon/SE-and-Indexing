<ABSTRACT>
A plurality of line-shaped first element separation 
oxide films (23) parallel to the bit line are formed on 

the surface of the P-type silicon substrate. The first 
and second trenches are formed in that portion of the 

P-type silicon substrate which is located between each 
adjacent pair of the first element separation oxide 

films (23) such that both sides of the trenches come in 
contact with the first element separation oxide films 

(23). A sheath plate capacitor is formed in each of the 
trenches (24). The second element separation oxide film 

having a thickness less than that of the first element 
separation oxide films (23) is formed on that portion of 

the surface of the P-type silicon substrate which is 
located between the first and second trenches (24).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a semiconductor 
memory device and a method of manufacturing the device, 
and particularly, to a pattern layout of a high-integration 
and large-capacity dynamic RAM (random 
access read/write memory). The degree of integration and the size of capacity 
of dynamic RAMs are increased quickly as four times as 
much in the last three years. In accordance with such 
an increment, the structure in which a capacitor is 
formed within a trench for the purpose of integrating a 
capacitor having a sufficient capacity within a small 
area, has been proposed. An example of the device 
having such a structure is a dynamic RAM having a HSPC 
(half-Vcc sheath-plate capacitor) discussed in IEEE 
TRANSACTIONS ON ELECTRON DEVICES, VOL. 35, NO. 8, 1988, 
P.1257. FIG. 1 is a plan view showing a layout of the main 
layer of a conventional semiconductor memory device. 
FIGS. 2 to 4 illustrate a method of manufacturing the 
conventional semiconductor memory device. FIG. 2 
illustrates the first step, and is a cross section of 
the section taken along the line 2-2 in FIG. 1, after 
the completion of the first step. FIG. 3 illustrates 
the first step, and is a cross section of the section 
taken along the line 3-3 in FIG. 1, after the completion 
of the first step. FIG. 4 illustrates the second step,  
 
and is a cross section of the section taken along the 
line 4-4 in FIG. 1, after the completion of the second 
step. First, as shown in FIGS. 2 and 3, an element 
separation oxide film 3a is formed on the surface of a 
P-type silicon substrate 1 by the LOCOS (local oxidation 
of silicon) method using a mask 2b having to the element 
separation pattern 2a. More specifically, a silicon nitride film (not 
shown) is formed on the surface of a P-type silicon 
substrate 1, and the silicon nitride film is etched 
using the mask 2b having the element separation pattern 
2a. Next, the surface of the portion of the P-type 
silicon substrate 1, which is exposed by the etching, is 
thermally oxidized, thus forming an element separation 
oxide film 3a. In this case, the transfer error between 
the mask 2b having the element separation pattern 2a and 
the element separation oxide film 3a varies in accordance 
with the pattern shape of the element separation 
oxide film 3a. In detail, the transfer error ΔL₁ with 
regard to the element separation oxide film 3a shown in 
FIG. 2 is larger than the conversion error ΔL₂ with 
regard to the element separation oxide film 3a shown in 
FIG. 3. After that, the silicon
