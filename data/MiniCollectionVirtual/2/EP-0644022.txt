<ABSTRACT>
An expert system containing a built-in application knowledge is 
used with a controllable cutting system (10) to automatically seek an optimal 

feed rate during cutting in response to various of a number of possible changing 
system cutting parameters wherein a programmable controller (12) defines and 

specifies a preset configuration file defining the specific cutting system control 
parameters for directing the operation of the cutting system in accordance with a 

contour defining a path be followed by a cutter (20) carried by the cutting system 
and which cutter is moved in an X, Y and C coordinate space across the cutting 

surface (24) of the cutting system. The X, Y and C axes motors (34,36,44) are 
driven with a commanded current to move the cutter with a velocity defined in 

the configuration file. The cutting force developed by the cutter is determined at 
predetermined portions of the contour to determine the toughness of the spread 

and the actual cutting force is compared to the optimal cutting force with the feed 

rate being adjusted to increase when the actual force is below the expected 
force and decrease when the actual force is above the expected force and to 

shut down the cutting system to rebuilt the contours when the actual force 
exceeds the expected force by a predetermined magnitude. The feed rate is 

computed for the contour taking into account information concerning the 
toughness of the material being cut, the sharpened data, the vacuum level, the 

knife motor current and the knife velocity.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates generally to apparatus for cutting
sheet material with a closed loop control and deals more particularly with a
cutting system and related method using an expert system containing built-in
application knowledge with real time monitoring of critical system parameters to
control the system's cutting speed during cutting in order adapt the automatic
controls to existing conditions and improve and optimize system performance.It is well known to use automatically controlled cutting machines for
cutting limp sheet materials used in garments, upholstery, and other items.
Such machines conventionally derive information defining the articles or
patterns to be cut from a marker. The marker is a closely arranged array of
patterned pieces in positional relationship for cutting from a layup of sheet
material. The contours of the pattern pieces which define the cutting paths to be
followed by the cutting blade are the rough data which are utilized by the
automatically controlled cutting machine in guiding the cutting blade, and such
data is translated by the machine into machine commands by appropriate 
hardware. For example, the marker may be digitized to reduced the contours to
point data and when the point data is processed through a computer or data
processor to generate machine commands which translate the cutting blade and
sheet material relative to one another. The marker data may be preprocessed
and recorded for subsequent use in a cutting machine or the data may be
processed during the cutting operation.In most prior art cutting systems which are automated, the cutting
operation is substantially fixed by pre-established programs and the marker
data. Thus, the maneuvering of the cutting blade along a desired line of cut is
controlled in accordance with relatively standard routines that have proven in
general to be suitable for many cutting conditions but not necessarily all cutting
conditions nor unanticipated conditions and certainly do not represent optimal
cutting routines. For example, the standard cutting operation may not be
suitable or may produced poor results with certain types of limp sheet material,
with layups of substantial depths and even within a single layup displaying
different cutting characteristics under different conditions. Improvements over
earlier systems have been made which allow a degree of flexibility in the cutting
program by allowing the person digitizing the marker to call for special cutting
blade maneuvers such as yawing and reduced feed rates
