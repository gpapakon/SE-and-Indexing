<ABSTRACT>
A plastic flexible grinding stone comprising a 
plastic flexible material having with a powder 

synthetic detergent and an abrasive composed of 
grains from 3 to 50 µm in diameter, said abrasive being 

at least one of silica sand, calcium carbonate, alumina, 
ceramics, and Green Carborundum. The grinding stone is 

capable of removing simultaneously minute protrusions 
and strains from coated surfaces of, for example, 

rolling stock and machines.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a plastic flexible
grinding stone for use in removing, by polishing, small
protrusions which are generated on the coated surfaces of rolling
stock and industrial machines, as well as in removing stains
and oil films from the surface of window glass .When rolling stock is placed in parking lots near to
railways and iron works, or in places close to construction
sites where coating operations are conducted, iron powder and
paint mist contact the coated surfaces of the rolling stock
and adhere thereto to form minute protrusions. Such
unfavorable protrusions were conventionally removed by
polishing the surface using a compound or sand paper.However, when a compound or sand paper is applied to
the surface to remove the protrusions, not only the
protrusions but also the coated surface are brought into
contact with the abrasive thus forming scratches or flaws on the
coated surface. As illustrated schematically in FIG. 3(a), it
can be seen that this type of polishing suffers very poor
operability, because the abrasive force is fully (100%) 
exerted on the coated surface if the abrasive force is fully
applied to the protrusions.With a view to ameliorating the poor operatability of the
conventional method, the present inventors have previously
proposed in JP-B-4-11335 (the term "JP-B-" as referred herein
signifies "an examined published Japanese patent
application"), a plastic flexible grinding stone comprising
a plastic flexible material having mixed therewith fine
abrasive
composed of grains from 3 to 50 µm in diameter,
such as silica sand and calcium carbonate. When
polishing is conducted using the proposed grinding stone,
however, as shown in Fig.3(b) no (0%) polishing force is exerted
on the coated surface when the polishing force is fully(100%)
applied to the protrusions. Accordingly, it can be seen that
favorable operability is realized for the protrusions,
but that stains cannot be removed from the coated surface.Conventional grinding stones include plastic
flexible grinding stones comprising a plastic flexible material having
incorporated therein silica sand and calcium carbonate. The
protrusions formed by adhesion of minute granules or
droplets to the coated surface can be removed completely
using those grinding stones, however, stains were left to be
removed by other means.An object of the present invention is to obtain a smooth 
and plain coated surface by polishing, and yet removing stain
from the smooth and plane surface. Accordingly, the present
invention comprises
