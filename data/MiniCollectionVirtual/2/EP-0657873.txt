<ABSTRACT>
A speech signal bandwidth compression and 
expansion apparatus and its method. On the transmitting 

side, system parameters (a
i
) are extracted (103) from a 
speech signal by a linear prediction analyzer. A 

prediction residual signal (x'(nΔT)) is obtained by 
inverse filtering processing by using the system parameters. 

The prediction residual signal is lowered in 
sampling rate by a down-sampler (109) and converted to a 

baseband signal (x'(nΔt)). From the baseband signal, a 
time series signal is derived by a linear prediction 

synthesizer (110). Thereafter, the time series signal 
is converted to an analog signal and transmitted, On 

the receiving side, a received signal is subjected to 
inverse filtering processing to reproduce a baseband 

signal. The sampling rate of the reproduced baseband 
signal is raised to derive a time series signal. From 

the time series signal, a high frequency band component 
is generated. The high frequency band component is 

added to the baseband signal to generate an excitation 
signal. From the excitation signal, the original speech 

signal is reproduced by a linear prediction synthesizer.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a bandwidth
compression apparatus making possible bandwidth compression
of speech signals in the state of analog signals,
and in particular to a speech signal bandwidth compression
and expansion apparatus suitable for analog
transmission on narrow band radio transmission channels.In recent years, use of radio transmission
lines have gone on increasing. On the other hand, the
radio frequency bands are finite resources. Therefore,
compression of the occupied bandwidth is demanded
strongly from not only the aspect of cost reduction but
also the aspect of effective use of resources.To take the instance of speech signal transmission
as an example, the frequency band of human
speech signals typically extends over several kilohertz
although there is an individual difference. For transmission
thereof, therefore, a transmission system having
a frequency band of several kilohertz in the same way is
needed. If the occupied bandwidth can be compressed
without impairing articulation required for information
transmission using speech, the cost required for the
transmission system can be reduced.From the past, therefore, various bandwidth
compression techniques for speech signals have been 
proposed. In an example of known bandwidth compression
techniques for speech signals, bandwidth compression of
speech signals is attained by grasping the human vocal
organ as a kind of autoregression system, simulating a
speech signal as a signal generated by this autoregression
system, and extracting system parameters by using
prediction analysis. Examples are disclosed in the
following papers.
