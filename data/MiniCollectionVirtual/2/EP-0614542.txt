<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to photographic silver
halide emulsions and specifically to emulsions which
contain dyes for spectral sensitization and increased
photographic speed. This invention relates more
specifically to photographic emulsions which contain
arylidene sensitizing dyes for use with tabular grains
and the use of these photographic emulsions with x-ray
intensifying screens.Photographic emulsions which contain predominantly
tabular silver halide grains are well known in the prior
art. These grains are known to provide several
advantages over more conventional spherical grains.
Tabular grains can generally be coated at a lower
coating weight than conventional, grains thereby
providing a savings in the manufacturing cost of the
film. However, since tabular grains have an inherently
low sensitivity to actinic radiation there is a pressing
need to provide spectral sensitizing dyes so that all of
the advantages of tabular grains can be fully exploited.
Spectral sensitizing dyes are well known in the art for
green and red sensitization of tabular grains yet
relatively few examples are provided for spectral
sensitization of tabular grains in the ultraviolet and
blue regions of the electromagnetic spectrum.The use of photographic emulsions, as described
above, with x-ray intensifying screens is well known in
the art of medical imaging, e.g. EP-A-0 256 535 discloses
a photographic film comprising a blue-sensitized
silver halide emulsion used in combination with X-ray
intensifying screens.The x-ray intensifying screens typically comprise a
phosphor as the active element for conversion of x-ray
energy to lower energy visible or ultraviolet radiation. Particularly efficient phosphors which may be used
in the preparation of an X-ray intensifying screen are
the tantalates described by Brixner in U.S. Patent
4,225,623. These phosphors are based on yttrium,
lutetium, and gadolinium tantalates of the M' monoclinic
form and may be activated with rare earths such as
terbium, thulium and niobium, for example, as well
described in the aforementioned reference. Since these
phosphors have a high X-ray stopping power, they are
presently widely used for the preparation of these
intensifying screens and the method for their
preparation includes the mixing of ingredients followed
by firing this mixture to form the phosphor crystal
lattice itself.Phosphor screen combinations have been widely
utilized in the art. The majority of this use has been
with green emitting screens and photographic emulsions
which are sensitized to
