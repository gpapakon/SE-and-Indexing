<ABSTRACT>
The present invention relates to the use of 3'-(L-ascorbyl-2-o-phosphoryl)-cholesterol, 3'-(L-ascorbyl-3-o-phosphoryl)-cholesterol, and their derivatives ("APC compounds"). More specifically, the present invention relates to use of APC compounds to improve the appearance and health of skin, hair, lips and nails. The present invention also relates to methods of topically administering APC compounds to cleanse skin and remove make-up, moisturize skin, enhance the shine and wear of nail coating compositions, and to improve compositions having pigments and/or iron oxides. Additional novel uses of APC compounds provided by the present invention include a method of reducing epidermal synthesis of abnormal elastin, especially epidermal synthesis of abnormal elastin that results from exposure to UV radiation. Also disclosed are novel methods of stimulating keratinocyte formation of triglycerides and achieving antioxidant activity in the skin by topically applying APC compounds.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to novel topical compositions. More particularly, the present invention is directed to topical compositions that have 3'-(L-ascorbyl-2-o-phosphoryl)-cholesterol, 3'-(L-ascorbyl-3-o-phosphoryl)-cholesterol, and their derivatives (hereinafter collectively referred "APC compound" or "APC compounds") as well as an iron oxide component. The present invention also relates to a method of improving the appearance of skin.U.S. Patent No. 4,939,128 to Kato et al. is directed to the use of phosphoric acid esters of ascorbic acid for the treatment of systemic diseases, and not for cosmetics, topical dermatological or skin uses. This patent provides that certain phosphoric acid esters of ascorbic acid display improved oxygen-scavenging properties. However, the specific mention of a cholestenyl group suggests that conjugates of L-ascorbic acid and cholesterol were neither practical nor desired. The Kato et al. patents fail to disclose phosphoric acid diesters of ascorbic acid and cholesterol, and the synergistic results that may be obtained in topical compositions through the incorporation of effective amounts of APC compounds.U.S. Patent No. 5,607,968 to Ptchelintsev provides a method of making ascorbic acid-phosphoryl derivatives that incorporate straight chain (C2 to C18) alkyl groups.Heretofore, consumers desired cosmetic compositions that have been synergistically improved by incorporating APC compounds therein. Consumers also desired additional methods of improving the health and appearance of their skin, nails and lips using such APC compounds.The present invention relates to novel topical compositions. More particularly, the present invention is directed to topical compositions that have 3'-(L-ascorbyl-2-o-phosphoryl)-cholesterol, 3'-(L-ascorbyl-3-o-phosphoryl)-cholesterol, and their derivatives (hereinafter collectively referred "APC compound" or "APC compounds") as well as an iron oxide component. The present invention also relates to novel uses of topical compositions having APC compounds to enhance the appearance and health of skin, lips and nails. The present invention further relates to novel methods of topically administering compositions having APC compounds, such as with a lipstick or a dermal patch.The present invention, in brief summary, is topical compositions having APC compounds, and methods of administering these topical compositions to improve the condition of skin, as well as its appearance.Fig. 1 illustrates that 3'-(L-ascorbyl-2-o-phosphoryl)-cholesterol

<CLAIMS>
A method of improving the appearance of skin comprising the step of applying to the skin a composition comprising:

an iron oxide component; and
an effective amount of a compound selected from the group consisting of 3'-(L-ascorbyl-2-o-phosphoryl)-cholesterol, 3'-(L-ascorbyl-3-o-phosphoryl)-cholesterol, isomers thereof, salts thereof and mixtures thereof.
A composition having an iron oxide component and comprising an effective amount of a compound selected from the group consisting of 3'-(L-ascorbyl-2-o-phosphoryl)-cholesterol, 3'-(L-ascorbyl-3-o-phosphoryl)-cholesterol, isomers thereof, salts thereof and mixtures thereof in a suitable vehicle, wherein the composition is selected from the group consisting of a lip cosmetic, a nail coating composition, a nail enamel, a make-up remover and a photoprotective topical composition.
The composition of claim 2, wherein the lip cosmetic is a lipstick.
