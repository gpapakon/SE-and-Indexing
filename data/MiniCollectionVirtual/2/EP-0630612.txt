<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to an instrument for use in 
endoscopic procedures. More specifically, this invention 
relates to an instrument which includes an electromagnetic 
sensor in the head of the instrument to determine and/or 
measure tissue parameters during an endoscopic procedure. Endoscopic surgery has been gaining wide acceptance 
as an improved and cost effective technique for conducting 
certain surgical procedures. In endoscopic surgery, a 
trocar, which is a pointed piercing device, is inserted in 
the body with a cannula placed around the trocar. After 
the trocar accomplishes piercing of the abdominal walls, 
it is removed and the cannula remains in the body. Often 
multiple openings are produced in the body with a trocar. 
Through these cannula, endoscopic procedures are possible. 
An endoscopic instrument may be placed in one cannula, an 
appropriate viewing mechanism placed in another cannula 
and the fiber optics for illuminating the surgical field 
in yet another cannula. Generally, these endoscopic 
procedures take place under insufflation. As more is 
learned about endoscopic procedures and more instruments 
developed, the type of procedures that may be performed 
endoscopically will increase. Presently, typical 
procedures are gall bladder removal, tissue repair, and 
various sterilization procedures. Many of the instruments used in endoscopic procedures 
are used to join tissue, grasp tissue, or otherwise 
manipulate tissue. Such instruments usually have a pair 
of jaws which are placed about the tissue to be  
 
manipulated, then the instrument is activated to 
manipulate the tissue. As can be appreciated, it is often 
quite difficult to be certain you have the jaws positioned 
correctly to manipulate the tissue and/or you have the 
right amount of tissue between the jaws in an appropriate 
position to manipulate the tissue. It is an object of the present invention to provide 
an instrument that will allow the user to know when he has 
the jaws of an instrument appropriately placed about 
tissue. In certain embodiments, it is an object of the 
present invention to control an instrument so that it 
cannot be activated until the jaws are in an appropriate 
position about the tissue to be manipulated. In other 
embodiments, it is an object of the present invention to 
provide a feedback device for tissue fastening parameters. The present invention provides a surgical instrument 
which has a pair of spaced apart and movable jaws. The 
instrument includes means for moving at least one

<CLAIMS>
A surgical instrument having: 
   a pair of spaced apart surfaces, said surfaces being 

movable with respect to each other to accomplish a step in 
a surgical procedure; 

   an electromagnetic sensor disposed in one of said 
surfaces; and 

   a magnetic target disposed in either of said surfaces 
for producing a magnetic field between said surfaces, 

whereby a physical relationship between said surfaces may be 
determined. 
The surgical instrument of claim 1, wherein the 
electromagnetic sensor is a magnetoresistive sensor. 
The surgical instrument of claim 2, wherein the 
magnetoresistive sensor is magnetically biased. 
The surgical instrument of claim 2 or claim 3, wherein 
the magnetoresistive sensor is gamma-radiation sterilizable. 
The surgical instrument of any one of claims 1 to 4, 
wherein the magnetic target is a permanent magnet. 
The surgical instrument of any one of claims 1 to 4, 
wherein the magnetic target is an electromagnet. 
The surgical instrument of any one of claims 1 to 6, 
wherein variations in the magnetic field measure the 

distance between the surfaces. 
The surgical instrument of any one of claims 1 to 7, 
wherein the electromagnetic sensor is disposed in one of 

said surfaces and the magnetic target is disposed in the 
other of said surfaces. 
The surgical instrument of any one of claims 1 to 8, 
wherein the surfaces are a pair of jaws for applying a 

 
surgical fastener to tissue. 
The surgical fastener of claim 9, including means for 
using the determined physical relationship to control other 

surgical fastening parameters. 
The surgical instrument of any one of claims 1 to 8, 
which is adapted for endoscopic surgery and which has a 

distal end for carrying out a step in a surgical procedure 
within a body cavity, a proximal end for manipulating said 

distal end from outside the body cavity and an elongate 
shaft portion connecting said distal and proximal ends, 

wherein said surfaces comprise a pair of spaced apart jaw 
members at said distal end. 
The surgical instrument of claim 11, wherein one of 
said jaw members is movable and the other is stationary. 
The surgical instrument of claim 12, which is a 
stapler adapted for endoscopic surgery, wherein: 

   a plurality of staples for use in joining tissue is 
disposed in said stationary jaw; 

   said movable jaw includes anvil means for forming 
staples; 

   means are disposed in said elongate shaft portion, 
extending from said proximal end to the distal end of the 

stapler, for moving said movable jaw into forming 
relationship with said stationary jaw; and 

   actuating means are disposed in said elongate shaft 
portion, extending from the proximal end to the distal end 

of the stapler, for urging said staples towards said anvil 
means to form said staples to join tissue placed between 

said jaws.
