<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to blends of oil such
as mineral oil or vegetable oil with alkyl-modified silicones
(AMS) that are useful as adjuvants for agricultural
applications.Many useful oil-based agricultural chemicals are
less effective than desired because they don't spread
well. It is typical to apply oil-based chemicals using a
carrier such as a mineral or vegetable oil, or to apply
dormant oils as aqueous sprays. The bulk surface tension
of a liquid plays a key role in its ability to spread on
hydrophobic surfaces such as a wary leaf cuticle or an
arthropod exoskeleton. If the surface tension of a liquid
such as an unmodified mineral or vegetable oil is not
sufficiently low, the droplet will not effectively
spread. There is a need for adjuvants which reduce the
surface tension of lipophilic liquids and, thereby, increase
the effectiveness of oil-based agricultural chemicals.The use of oils as adjuvants or carriers for agricultural
applications is well known. Petroleum and vegetable
oils have been used in formulations for dormant
spray oils, in preparations for the management of insects
and mites including those that suffocate arthropod pests 
by clogging their spiracles, in crop oil concentrates and
crop oils, and in emulsifiable concentrates. One of the
effects of the oil is to increase the penetration of
pesticides into the target organism. In addition, the
oils enhance spreading on target surfaces, which increases
coverage.According to P.J. McCall, et al. (J. Agric. Food
Chem., 34(2), 235-8), the addition of a crop oil concentrate
(COC) to atrazine spray solutions significantly increased
the amount of pesticide absorbed by giant foxtails
sprayed with the chemical. Typically, 30% of the
applied chemical penetrated the leaf in the presence of
COC, while only 10% penetrated without COC.Kulkarni, et al. (U.S. Pat No. 4,514,319) disclosed
relatively high molecular weight alkyl-modified silicones
that, when used in connection with organo-silicone surfactants,
reduced the surface tension of hydrocarbon oils
containing hydrophobic fillers, thus providing high efficiency
antifoam compositions.In U.S. Pat. No. 5,045,225, Aronson, et al., disclosed
the use of alkylaminosilicones that were soluble
in mineral oil and resulted in enhanced surface activity.
The compounds imparted self-hydrophobing properties to
antifoam compositions containing hydrophilic mineral
particles such as silica.McAfee, et al. (U.S. Pat. No. 4,171,267) disclosed
an organopolysiloxane fluid as a component of a miscible
composition
