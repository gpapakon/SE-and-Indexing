<ABSTRACT>
Bumper bowling systems include retractable bumpers (23, 24) and mechanisms (44a, 45a) connected to the retractable bumpers disposed alongside a bowling alley's gutters (14, 15). The mechanisms (44a, 45a) are adapted to extend the bumpers (23, 24) into a position which prevent bowling balls from falling into the gutter and also to retract the bumpers to permit ordinary bowling. A segmented longitudinally extending cap (18a-d) and a structural support member (19) are also provided so that the cap covers the bumper mechanism.

 BOWLING ALLEY BUMPER SYSTEMFIELD OF THE INVENTIONThis invention relates to bowling alley bumper systems and the mechanisms which include elongated retractable bumpers disposed alongside a bowling alley's gutters and, more particularly, to such systems which include a cap or cover disposed above the mechanism.BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTIONBowling alley bumper systems have been available since at least as early as 1965. Such systems were designed to be used by children and/or the physically handicapped as well as others who lack the physical coordination or strength to bowl, i.e., project a majority of the balls over the length of the alley without ending up in one of the gutters. Early systems required relatively difficult steps to set up a lane or lanes for so called "bumper" bowling.For this reason, a number of bowling alley operating personnel were reluctant to promote "bumper" bowling or to encourage children or the handicapped to use their lanes.More recently, a bowling alley bumper mechanism such as the one disclosed in the United States patent of Chandler et al., Number 4,900,024, overcame many of the earlier problems. In such systems, an elongated bumper is mounted alongside and parallel to each alley gutter. . The systems also include movable supports that permit the extension of the bumpers to guard the gutters when guarding is desired and retraction of the bumpers to expose the gutters when normal alley operation is desired.It is now believed that the availability of the Chandler-type systems, coupled with a change in demographics and business pressures will encourage bowling alley operators to put more emphasis on bumper bowling to encourage children to learn to bowl, attract families and to provide a challenging game for the physically handicapped. For this reason, it is believed that there is a demand for an improved bowling alley bumper system which provides a more attractive appearance, is relatively inexpensive to manufacture, easy to install and remove, protects the mechanism from damage and, at the same time, provides more ready 

 access to the rear of the lanes without walking on the lanes. In view of the fact that many such systems will be installed over a ball return, it is also desirable to have easy access to the ball return in the area of the ball pick-up mechanisms.It has now been found that an improved bowling alley bumper system, in accordance with the present invention, provides the aforementioned desirable features.BRIEF SIJTVÎ“MARY OF THE INVENTIONThe bowling alley bumper

<CLAIMS>
WHAT IS CLAIMED IS:
1. In a bowling alley bumper system for guarding the gutter of a bowling alley of the type having a mechanism including a longitudinal guide adjacent to and positioned alongside said gutters, said gutters having a major axis and said longitudinal guide mounted on the opposite side of said gutter from said alley, said bumper mechanism comprising: guarding means including a first elongated bumper separated from and disposed alongside said gutter and having a major axis parallel to the major axis of said gutter, and extending and retracting means for mounting, extending and retracting said bumper, said extending and retracting means being interconnected between said bumper and said longitudinal guide; said extending and retracting means being effective when in its extended condition to position said guarding means for deflecting bowling balls that may be directed toward said gutter, and said extending and retracting means being effective when in its retracted condition to position said guarding means for exposing said gutter and permitting balls directed toward said gutter to fall thereinto; said system also including a second alley adjacent to said first alley and wherein said longitudinal guide is disposed parallel to and between said gutter of said first alley and a gutter of said second alley, and wherein there is included a second elongated bumper disposed alongside said gutters of said second alley, and wherein said bumper system further comprises: second guarding means including said second elongated bumper separated from and disposed alongside said gutter of said second alley and having a major axis parallel to the major axis of said gutter of said second alley, and second extending and retracting means for mounting, .extending and retracting said second bumper, said second extending and retracting means being interconnected between said second bumper and said longitudinal guide, said second extending and retracting means being effective when in its extended condition to position said second guarding means for deflecting bowling balls that may be directed toward said second gutter, said second extending and retracting means being effective when in its retracted condition to position said second guarding means for exposing said second gutter and permit balls directed toward said second gutter to fall thereinto, the improvement comprising a segmented longitudinally extending cap means including a plurality of longitudinally extending segments which are disposed between adjacent alleys and separated therefrom by one of said gutters 


o eac o sa a eys an n w c sa ong tu na y extending segments toget er extend along the length of said alley for covering said bowling alley bumper system including said first and second elongated bumpers when in the retracted portion, segmented longitudinally extending structural support means which correspond to the segments of said cap means disposed below said cap means and supporting said cap means above said bumper system with sufficient structural integrity to permit a bowler to walk on said cap means without interfering with or damaging the bumper mechanism, said cap means further defining a longitudinally extending shoulder which extends outwardly beyond said support means and over said bowling alley bumper mechanism when said bumper mechanism is in a retracted position and access means within said cap means so that an individual can gain access to an area below said bowling alley bumper system without removing said cap means and said improvement further comprising said shoulder defining upper and lower surfaces and a longitudinal channel defined by said lower surface so that a portion of said bumper mechanism extends upwardly and into said channel.
