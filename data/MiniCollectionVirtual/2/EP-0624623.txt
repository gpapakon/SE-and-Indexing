<ABSTRACT>
Polymer composition containing a copolymer that 
contains units of a vinyl-aromatic compound and an α-β-unsaturated 

dicarboxylic anhydride compound and an 
elastomer, at least a portion of the elastomer containing 

groups that bond chemically or interact physically with 
the copolymer. The elastomer constitutes the continuous 

phase in the polymer composition and the copolymer the 
disperse phase.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a polymer composition 
containing a copolymer that contains units of a vinyl-aromatic 
compound and an α-β-unsaturated dicarboxylic 
anhydride compound and an elastomer, at least a portion of 
the elastomer containing groups that bond chemically or 
interact physically with the copolymer. Such polymer compositions are known from EP-A-0,140,423, 
which describes a polymer composition of: 
50-95 wt.% of a copolymer containing styrene and/or 
α-methylstyrene and maleic anhydride, 5-50 wt.% of an ethylene-propylene elastomer or an 
ethylene-propylene-diene elastomer modified by 
grafting with a compound containing hydroxyl, amide 
or amine groups. The hydroxyl, amide or amine groups can bond 
chemically with the dicarboxylic anhydride compounds in 
the copolymer. Such a polymer composition has a high impact 
resistance and a high stiffness. Because of this 
combination of properties the polymer composition has 
proved to be suitable for the manufacture of objects in 
which these properties are important, for example housings 
of electrical equipment. However, there is a need for a polymer 
composition which, unlike the polymer composition that is 
known from EP-A-0,140,423, has a high degree of 
flexibility so that the polymer composition can for 
example be folded in a simple manner and feels soft. Such 
a polymer composition is for example very suitable for 
handles and as a top layer on various other objects, such 
as dashboards or shavers.  Surprisingly a very useful, flexible polymer 
composition is obtained because the elastomer in the 
polymer composition constitutes the continuous phase and 
the copolymer in the polymer composition constitutes the 
disperse phase. In addition to good flexibility, the polymer 
composition has a large number of further advantages. For 
example, the polymer composition according to the 
invention has good mechanical properties at elevated 
temperatures (for example at 120°C), such as good 
stiffness, tensile strength and elongation at break. Furthermore, thanks to the presence of the 
copolymer, the polymer composition according to the 
invention can be well attached to other materials, such as 
metals and polar plastics, per example by heating the 
polymer composition to above the glass transition 
temperature of the copolymer and then contacting it with 
the surface or by contacting the polymer composition with 
a thermosetting resin like an unsaturated polyester resin 
and curing the resin. A further advantage are the favourable 
rheological
