<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to ligands to Tumor Necrosis Factor
receptors (TNF-Rs) which inhibit the effect of TNF but not its
binding to the TNF-Rs, as well as to ligands interacting with
other receptors of the TNF/NGF family.Tumor necrosis factor (TNF) is a pleiotropic cytokine, produced
by a number of cell types, mainly by activated macrophages. It
is one of the principal mediators of the immune and inflammatory
response. Interest in its function has greatly increased,
recently, in view of evidence of the involvement of TNF in the
pathogenesis of a wide range of disease states, including
endotoxin shock, cerebral malaria and graft-versus-host
reaction. Since many of the effects of TNF are deleterious to
the organism, it is of great interest to find ways of blocking
its action on host cells. An evident target for such intervention
are the molecules to which TNF has to bind in order to exert its
effects, namely the TNF-Rs. These molecules exist not only in
cell-bound, but also in soluble forms, consisting of the cleaved
extra-cellular domains of the intact receptors (see Nophar et
al., EMBO Journal, 9(10):3269-78, 1990). The soluble receptors
maintain the ability to bind TNF, and thus have the ability to
block its function by competition with surface receptors.Another method of TNF inhibition based on the principle of
competing with cell-bound molecules, is the use of antibodies
recognizing TNF receptors and blocking the ligand binding. The cell surface TNF-Rs are expressed in almost all cells of the
body. The various effects of TNF, the cytotoxic, growth-promoting
and others, are all signalled by the TNF receptors upon the
binding of TNF to them. Two forms of these receptors, which
differ in molecular size: 55 and 75 kilodaltons, have been
described, and will be called herein p55 and p75 TNF-R,
respectively. It should be noted, however, that there exist
publications which refer to these receptors also as p60 and p80.The TNF-Rs belong to a family of receptors which are involved in
other critical biological processes. Examples of these receptors
are the low affinity NGF receptor, which plays an important role
in the regulation of growth and differentiation of nerve cells.
Several other receptors are involved in the regulation of
lymphocyte growth, such as CDw40 and some others. Another member
of the family is the FAS receptor also called APO, a receptor
which is involved in signalling for apoptosis and which, based on
a study with mice deficient in its function, seems to play an
important role in the
