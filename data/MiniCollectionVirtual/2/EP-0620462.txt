<ABSTRACT>
In an optical fiber splice tray rack (22) and cabinet 
(10) for holding optical fiber splice trays (26) that 

enclose splices in optical fibers, the 
splice tray rack (22) has shelves (36) attached to a back 

panel (38), each shelf having a support surface (46) 
extending from the back panel (38) to a lip (48) that 

projects from the support surface (46), opposite the back 
panel (38) to define a tray receiving region for 

receiving one of the splice trays (26) and a resilient member 
(52) that acts generally parallel to the support surface (46) 

of each shelf (36) for holding the splice tray (26) within the 
tray receiving region. The box-like cabinet (10) has 

sides (72) defining a cabinet interior, and a tie-down 
bar (80) attached to the cabinet (10) within the cabinet 

interior for individually securing a protective outer 
jacket (16), an inner jacket and a strength member 

thereto.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a cabinet for
holding splice trays having spliced optical fibers
therein.It is often necessary to splice the ends of optical
fibers from one fiber optic cable to corresponding ends
of optical fibers from another fiber optic cable. This
is accomplished by "breaking-out" a portion of each of
the fiber optic cables, whereby the optical fibers
therein are exposed by stripping the protective jacket
from the fiber optic cable. The corresponding optical
fibers are then spliced together using various
techniques, such as fusion splicing or mechanical
splicing.A loop that includes the splice is coiled in the
spliced optical fibers. This loop is placed within a
protective splice tray. These splice trays may be as
simple as a rectangular tubular member having two
opposing and open sides through which the optical fibers
pass. More than one of these spliced loops may be
placed within the same splice tray.In large fiber optic systems, such as
telecommunication systems, many optical fibers must be
spliced together and these fibers may originate from
multiple fiber optic cables. To contain all of these
loops, multiple splice trays are required. In order to
provide organization and protection for the splices,
while still allowing for convenient access to the
optical fibers, the splice trays are held in a splice
tray rack within a splice tray cabinet.What is needed is a splice tray rack for holding
numerous splice trays of various configurations while
permitting easy insertion and withdrawal of the splice
trays and the optical fibers therein. What is further
required is a fiber optic cable management cabinet that
can hold the splice tray rack, the optical fibers of the 
fiber optic cables and the fiber optical cables themselves
in a manner that routes the optical fibers within the
cabinet as required and isolates the optical fibers from
disturbances of the fiber optic cable.W091/10927 describes adaptive racking and distribution
frame systems for handling optical fiber cables and
including racking sections with wall portions that can be
replaced without removing the section or displacing cables
in the section and further including housings with moveable
shelves that can be adapted to hold optical fiber splices,
optical fiber connectors or optical fiber spools. DE-A-4207531
describes a selectively positionable work tray for
use with an optical fiber cable management cabinet.It is an object of this invention to provide a cabinet
in which splice trays are held in an easily accessible and
organi

<CLAIMS>
A fiber optic splice cabinet (10) for encasing the
break-out ends (12a, 12b) of fiber optic cables (14),

each of the fiber optic cables having a plurality of
optical fibers (12) within an inner jacket that

correspond to optical fibers of another fiber optic
cable and cable strength members (18) surrounded by a

protective outer jacket (16), where the corresponding
optical fibers are spliced together and placed in a

splice tray (26), the fiber optic splice cabinet (10)
comprising;


a box-like fiber optic cable management cabinet
(24) having


a plurality of connected sides (70, 72)
defining a cabinet interior (74);
a plurality of access ports (78) within at
least one of the sides, each port constructed to pass

the break-out end of one of the fiber optic cables into
the cabinet interior;
a tie-down bar (80) attached to the cable management cabinet (24)
within the cabinet interior (74) and located adjacent to the

access port so the fiber optic cable can pass thereover,
for individually securing the protective outer jacket

(16), the inner jacket and the strength member (18)
thereto; and
an optical fiber splice tray rack (22) for holding
a plurality of optical fiber splice trays (26) within

the cabinet interior (74), having
a back panel (38) attached to the cable management cabinet
(24);
a plurality of shelves (36) attached to the

back panel (38), each shelf (36) having a support
surface (46) extending from the back panel to a lip (48)

that projects from the support surface opposite the back
panel to define a tray receiving region (50) for 

receiving one of the splice trays, the fiber optic
splice cabinet being characterized in that:
a resilient member (52) is provided for acting
generally parallel to the support surface (46) of each

shelf to bias the tray against the lip (48) for holding the splice tray within the tray
receiving region.
A fiber optic splice cabinet of Claim 1, wherein
the cable management cabinet (24) includes

a plurality of optical fiber bend radius limiters (98)
having an arcuate member (100) with a radius larger than

the cabinet interior (74) for routing the optical fibers,
whereby directional changes in the optical fiber route

occurring along the optical fibers bend radius limiters
(98) take place through radii larger than the minimum

critical radius of the optical fiber.
A fiber optic splice tray cabinet of Claim lor 2,
wherein the cable management cabinet has a

selectively positionable work tray (110) that is
positionable to coincide approximately with the shelf

(36) and extend horizontally from the cabinet interior (74),
whereby a generally horizontal work tray (110) may be

provided at each shelf (36).
A fiber optic splice tray cabinet of Claim 1, 2 or 3,
wherein each shelf (36) of the splice tray rack (22) has

a bent portion (51) extending from the support surface
(46) to support the optical fibers as they enter the

splice tray.
A fiber optic splice tray cabinet of Claim 1, 2,3 or 4,
wherein the resilient member comprises a plurality of elastic

foam sponges (52).
