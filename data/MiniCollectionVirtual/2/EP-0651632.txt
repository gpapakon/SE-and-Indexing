<ABSTRACT>
A hair cosmetic composition including (a) at least one compound selected from fatty acids containing a linear or branched alkyl or alkenyl group having 12-40 carbon atoms, salts thereof and fatty acid esters composed of one of the fatty acids and a polyhydric alcohol; (b) at least one aromatic alcohol represented by general formula (1), wherein R1 means a hydrogen atom or a methyl or methoxy group, Y denotes a single bond or a linear or branched alkylene or alkenylene group having 1-3 carbon atoms, Z is a hydrogen atom or a hydroxyl group, and p and q stand individually for a number of 0-5; and (c) at least one cationic surfactant. The hair cosmetic composition has neither sticky nor oily feel to the touch, is excellent in hair-conditioning effects of, for example, giving users a moistured feel of the hair and imparting softness and smoothness to the hair, gives resilience to the hair and is superb in effects of preventing damage to the hair and of keeping the waves or curls of the hair beautiful.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to hair cosmetic compositions, and more specifically to hair cosmetic compositions which are excellent in hair-conditioning effects, and also can impart resilience to the hair and are superb in effects of preventing damage to the hair and of keeping the waves or curls of the hair beautiful.In the conventional hair cosmetic compositions, a cationic surfactant such as a linear mono- or di-long-chain alkyl quaternary ammonium salt or branched mono- or di-long-chain alkyl quaternary ammonium salt has been incorporated with a view toward making the feel of the hair to the touch better, and an oil or fat such as a higher alcohol, glyceride or liquid paraffin has been used in combination with such a cationic surfactant to make the feel of the hair to the touch still better.On the other hand, as methods of imparting resilience to the hair, there have been known, for example, a method in which a high-molecular weight substance is added to a hair cosmetic composition to cause the high-molecular weight substance to be adsorbed on the surface of the hair, thereby imparting resilience to the hair; and a method in which an astringent is incorporated into a hair cosmetic composition to astringe the hair.However, these conventional hair cosmetic compositions have involved a drawback that the feel of the hair to the touch, i.e., softness, a moistured feel, smoothness and an antistat effect, which are hair-conditioning effects brought about thereby, are insufficient. With respect to the moistured feel of the hair, therefore, a measure to use an oil or fat in combination to make up for its deficiency has been taken. However, this measure has been accompanied by sticky and oily feel to the touch, and particularly still involved a problem that the hair-conditioning effects are insufficient for the damaged hair in a dry state. The conventional hair cosmetic compositions have also been insufficient in effects of preventing damage to the hair and of keeping the waves or curls of the hair beautiful. In addition, it has been impossible to improve the resilience of the hair while exhibiting these effects.Therefore, there has been a demand for the development of a hair cosmetic composition which has neither sticky nor oily feel to the touch, is excellent in hair-conditioning effects of, for example, giving users a moistured feel, recovers resilience and is sufficient in effects of preventing damage to the hair and of keeping the waves or curls of the hair beautiful.EP-A-0 141 143 discloses a hair
