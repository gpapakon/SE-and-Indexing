<ABSTRACT>
Cyclic polysiloxanes are produced by continuously 
passing a feed comprising linear polysiloxanes through a 

reactor containing a solid acidic catalyst at a pressure 
greater than one atmosphere under an inert atmosphere to 

produce a mixture comprising volatile cyclic polysiloxanes, 
nonvolatile reaction products, and unreacted linear 

polysiloxanes. The volatile products can then be recovered, 
and the nonvolatile reaction products and unreacted linear 

polysiloxanes can be added to the linear polysiloxane feed 
to form a recycle stream that is passed back through the 

reactor. Recycling increases the yield of the desired 
cyclic species.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a process for preparing
cyclic polysiloxanes from linear polysiloxanes.Commercial siloxane polymers are generally produced by
the hydrolysis of dichlorosilanes, yielding a mixture of
cyclic and linear polysiloxanes. The production of cyclic
polysiloxanes can be enhanced relative to linear
polysiloxanes by performing the hydrolysis in a highly
dilute solution, which improves the probability of
cyclization versus oligomerization.The preparation of poly(organohydrosiloxanes) is of
particular interest due to the reactivity of the silicon-hydrogen
bond. Organosilicon compounds can be produced by
reaction of olefins with the ≡SiH groups. The production of
cyclic poly(organohydrosiloxanes), however, is especially
difficult via the hydrolysis reaction due to the high
reactivity of the silicon-hydrogen bond. Several methods other than hydrolysis have been
reported to produce cyclic polysiloxanes. Most prior
processes involve the base-catalyzed thermal cracking of
poly(diorganosiloxanes). Cyclic polysiloxanes have been
prepared by Hunter et al., Journal of the American Chemical
Society, 68, 667, (1946) via the cracking of linear
polysiloxanes in the presence of a base catalyst, such as
sodium hydroxide. Okamato et al., US-A 3,989,733,
describe a process for the thermal cracking of
poly(diorganosiloxanes) in the presence of lithium hydroxide
to produce cyclic poly(diorganosiloxanes). A process for
the catalyzed cracking of silicone polymers is disclosed by
Greenlee, US-A-5,110,972. High molecular weight
silicone polymers are dissolved in an organic solvent
containing sulfuric acid at 150-180°C, and cracked to lower
molecular weight linear species. This is followed by the
addition of potassium hydroxide and the distillation of the
cyclic products from the solution. Kuznetsova et al.,
US-A-3,558,681, describe the preparation of
methylphenylcyclotri- and tetrasiloxanes by the vapor phase
rearrangement of the linear siloxane at 250-360°C using
lithium hydroxide or lithium silanolate as the catalyst.A process for preparing a product cyclopolydiorganosiloxane
(R2SiO)C, from a feed cyclopolydiorganosiloxane (R2SiO)X is
described by Halm et al (U.S. Pat. No. 4,764,631). 
While cyclic poly(diorganosiloxanes) have been prepared with
varying degrees of success via base-catalyzed routes, the
preparation of cyclic poly(organohydrosiloxanes) via these
methods would be unacceptable. The base-catalyzed reaction
is constrained by the potentially violent reaction of
poly(organohydrosiloxanes) with alkali
