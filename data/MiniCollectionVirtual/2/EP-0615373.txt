<ABSTRACT>
Disclosed is an integrated telephone call session 
record-keeping system that creates and stores a single 

record containing data gathered during a single call 
session and retains the single record throughout a 

duration of the call to thereby eliminate a need to 
gather a particular datum multiple times during the 

particular call. The record contains information 
gathered from a caller and from various functional 

partitions within the system itself. The system 
comprises a common memory (310) for storing voice, text 

and/or image data and a common processor (210) for accessing 
the common memory (310) to thereby provide interaction with a 

telephone exchange coupled to the processor. The 
disclosed system is able to replace several prior art 

separate systems, including: automatic call directing 
systems, audio text systems, voice mail systems, voice 

response systems, automatic number identification 
systems, image-based systems and outbound calling 

systems.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to telephone communication 
systems and, more particularly, to an architecture in a 
computer-based system that allows integration of data 
processing and call processing features.  Over the years, various systems have been 
developed to operate in conjunction with telephone 
systems to provide specialized functions that lend 
power, versatility and efficiency to 
telecommunications. These various systems are designed to operate on 
data in one or more of three general categories: voice, 
text and image. Together, these types of data 
encompass all data desired to be processed or 
transmitted in communication systems. The above-described data can be processed or 
communicated in ways that can be generally categorized 
as "Mail" (also termed "Store and Forward"), 
"Interactive" and "Bulletin" systems. Mail systems 
allow a user to retrieve voice, text or images that 
have been exclusively addressed to the user. In such 
mail systems, it is typical to require the user to 
enter a unique password to gain access to the 
exclusively-addressed data. Interactive systems allow 
a user to control what data the interactive system 
delivers to the user, and, perhaps, in what order the 
data is delivered. Unlike mail systems, however, the 
data need not be exclusively-addressed, and thus can be 
publicly available. Lastly, bulletin systems allow a 
user to retrieve publicly available information in a 
non-interactive, system-controlled fashion. One such system directed to handling of data is 
automatic call distribution ("ACD"), wherein a pool of 
attendants is assigned to answer calls incoming on a  
 
particular trunk of telephone lines. ACD systems 
handle these calls as they arrive, assigning them to 
attendants in the order received and choosing the 
attendants based on length of idle time. This 
algorithm of queueing is called "fair queueing." 
Because human attendants are present, such ACD systems 
are interactive. Another such system is audio text. Audio text 
system are designed to "play" a message stored in a 
memory device to a person listening on the other end of 
the call. These systems are generally not interactive 
and can be bulletin systems. Yet another such system is a modem pool. Modem 
pool systems function in a manner similar to ACD 
systems. As a plurality of computers make incoming 
calls to a central pool of modems, typically attached 
to a single, large, general-purpose computer, the modem 
pool system assigns the incoming calls in a "fair 
queueing" manner. Such
