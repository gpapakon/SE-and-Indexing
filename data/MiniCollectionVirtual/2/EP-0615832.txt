<ABSTRACT>
A flexible, non-porous tube characterized by the fact that the void 
spaces (15, 17) present in the luminal surface (19) of a substrate tube (10) 

of porous polytetrafluoroethylene are filled with a silicone or fluorosilicone 
rubber (21), that a continuous coating of said fluorosilicone rubber is not 

present on the inner surface of said tube (10), and that the inner surface of 
said tube (10) incorporates surfaces of both the polytetrafluoroethylene 

and the silicone or fluorosilicone rubber (21). The tube (10) has excellent 
lubricity, resistance to contamination, resistance to chemicals, and has 

exceptional tube flexing properties. The flexible tube (10) may be 
employed, for example, as a tube for removal of gas destructively tested 

by a gas sensor, as a tube for transporting various liquids, and particularly 
as a tube in medical applications, such as a forceps channel tube, an 

endoscope channel tube, a bodily fluid transport tube, catheter tube, or the 
like. A method of making the tube is also described.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a flexible, non-porous tube
and to a method for the manufacture thereof.There exists a need for highly flexible, non-porous tubing
for various, primarily medical applications. These applications
typically involve the insertion of the tubing into a living body,
either temporarily or as a permanent implant. Temporary
applications include the use of the tubing as a catheter tubing
to convey fluids into or out of a body, or alternatively as the
tubing portion of a medical device such as an endoscope. Present
endoscope channel tubes are made of porous expanded PTFE having
a microstructure of nodes interconnected by fibrils, made as
taught by U.S. Patents 4,187,390 and 3,953,566. These tubes
typically have a very small pore size with a fibril length of
less than five microns. They are quite flexible, inert,
biocompatible and lubricious. However, due to the porosity of
the tubing, during use various contaminants such as proteins and
calcium tend to penetrate the void spaces present on the inner
or luminal surface of the tube and to adhere to the inner
surface. The adhesion of contaminants to the inner surface of
the tube resulted in a decline in the slip properties of the
inner surface, and also impaired other tube functions such as its
flexing properties. Moreover, washing and sterilization were
necessary in order to remove the contaminants so that the tube
could be reused. Washing and sterilization were time consuming,
and represented a burdensome operation.Various methods of improving this porous PTFE tube have been
attempted. For example, a tube in which an elastomer coating has
been formed on the inner surface of the tube
has been
proposed (Japanese Laid-Open Patent Applications 54-74514, 59-25725).
However, while a tube furnished with such an inner
surface elastomer coating has improved resistance to
contamination, the continuous elastomer 
coating, which has slip properties inferior to those of PTFE,
constitutes the inner surface of said tube, and as a result the slip
properties of the inner surface are diminished. Moreover, large
numbers of wrinkles are produced in the coating during flexing,
resulting in a further loss of slip properties.In Japanese Patent Publication 61-47547, a porous PTFE tube
wherein portions of said tube were impregnated with a solution of a
vinylidene fluoride/tetrafluoroethylene copolymer, polyvinyl chloride,
or another synthetic resin lacking elastic force, and then heated and
dried so that portions of the tube were filled with the synthetic
