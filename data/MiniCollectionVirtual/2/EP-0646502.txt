<ABSTRACT>
A vehicle safety harness, suitable for a child in a rear 
seat of a motor vehicle, comprises a sling 10 formed of a 

length of broad cargo webbing having straps 12 extending 
from its upper end for attachment to the vehicle bodywork, 

the sling 10 being connected at its lower end with a buckle 
20 by way of straps 18. Continuation of the straps 12 form 

shoulder straps 30 and run through respective buckle parts 
32 to form girth straps secured to respective sides of the 

sling 10, and continue as anchor straps 24 for attachment 
also to the vehicle. In use, a child is seated on the 

sling with his back against the upper part and the lower 
part is brought up between his legs so that the buckle part 

32 carried by the respective shoulder strap (30)/girth 
strap (34) combination can be fastened to the buckle 20.

<DESCRIPTION>
THIS INVENTION relates to a vehicle safety harness for a 
vehicle occupant and is of particular utility in relation 
to safety harnesses for young children travelling in motor 
cars or other motor vehicles. It is an object of the present invention to provide 
a vehicle safety harness which will hold the occupants 
securely and yet is readily fitted and removed when 
desired. According to the invention there is provided a 
vehicle safety harness comprising a length of broad 
flexible webbing having attachment means at an upper end 
for connection to a vehicle, the broad webbing being 
adapted, in use, to extend from said upper end down the 
back of the occupant and under the occupant's buttocks, a 
narrower portion of the harness, extending from the other 
end of said length of broad webbing, or formed by a 
narrowed portion of said broad webbing, extending between 
the occupant's legs and up in front of the occupant, said 
narrower or narrowed portion having its end further from 
the broad webbing connected directly or indirectly with 
shoulder straps which, in use, extend over the shoulders of 
the occupant to said upper end of said broad webbing or to 
said attachment means at said upper end of said broad 
webbing, the harness including girth straps extending, in 
use, from a portion of said broad webbing disposed behind 
the occupant at or below the waist to a portion of the 
harness disposed in front of the occupant. An embodiment of the invention is described below 
by way of example with reference to the accompanying 
drawings, in which:-  FIGURE 1 shows a harness embodying the invention 
unfitted to a vehicle and laid out flat, FIGURE 2 is a diagrammatic perspective view showing 
the harness in the position it occupies when fitted in a 
vehicle (not shown) and fastened about a child passenger 
(not shown) in the vehicle, FIGURE 3 is a fragmentary perspective view showing 
the harness, fitted in a vehicle seat (indicated in broken 
lines) and opened out to allow a child to be placed in the 
harness preparatory to fastening the harness about the 
child, FIGURE 4 is a fragmentary plan view illustrating a 
padded cover fitted to the sling part of the harness FIGURE 5 is a fragmentary perspective view, from 
the front, showing a detachable bib panel fastened to the 
front of the harness, as worn, and FIGURES 6 and 7 are schematic side views, partly in 
section, showing the securing of anchoring straps of the 
harness in different vehicle types. The harness illustrated in the drawings in intended
