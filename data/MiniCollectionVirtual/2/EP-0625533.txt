<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to compositions 
containing vinyl ether functional silicones and to their 
preparation and to their use. Silicone vinyl ethers are 
curable by addition of photocleavable acids and exposure to 
ultraviolet or electron beam radiation. Alkenyl ether functional organosilicon compounds 
have been described in the art. For example, U.S. Patent 
No. 4,617,238 discloses a photopolymerizable composition 
wherein only one vinyl ether group for each SiH group is 
incorporated into the siloxane molecule at any given time. Other alkenyloxy functional organosilicon compounds 
are described in U.S. Patent Nos. 4,707,503; 5,057,549; 
5,039,176 and EP Patent No. 0 462 389. The methods of the above documents rely on 
competition between the vinyl ether group and other alkenyl 
groups within the same compound and do not result in 
quantitative conversion of SiH to vinyl ether. In contrast, 
the method of the present invention yields quantitative 
conversion of hydridosilane or siloxanes to vinyl ether, a 
preferred radiation sensitive group. The present invention provides a method for making 
vinyl ether functional siloxane. The method comprising: (I) 
mixing a silane or siloxane, a vinyl ether compound and a 
hydrosilylation catalyst. In another embodiment, the present 
invention adds a photocleavable acid to the reaction product 
of (I), applies this mixture (II) to a solid substrate to 
form a coating and then exposes the coating to actinic 
radiation or a combination of actinic radiation and heat.  
 
The invention further relates to a vinyl ether functional 
polysiloxane compound and to a curable composition comprising 
this polysiloxane compound in combination with a photo-cleavable 
acid. It is an object of the present invention to provide 
a novel method of preparing UV (ultraviolet) or EB (electron 
beam) curable organopolysiloxanes suitable for paper release 
applications. It is also an object of the present invention to 
produce silicone vinyl ether copolymers or oligomers which 
are curable by addition of photocleavable acids and exposure 
to UV or EB radiation. It is a further object of this invention to provide 
UV- curable silicone compositions which may be catalyzed by a 
variety of curing catalysts at especially rapid cure rates. Thus, a method of making a vinyl ether functional 
siloxane comprises (I) mixing (A) a silicon compound selected 
from (i) silanes and (ii) siloxanes; (B) a vinyl ether 
compound selected from (a) H₂C=CHOROCH=CH₂, (b) 
(H₂C=CHOR)xCR¹4-x and (c) a
