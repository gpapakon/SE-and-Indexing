<ABSTRACT>
A Z-shape pressure-sensitive adhesive tape folded into 
a Z-shape and composed of an (a) portion, a (b) portion, and a 

(c) portion, wherein a releasing treatment layer (2) is formed on 
the outside surface of the (a) portion of the Z-shape tape and 

the surface of the (b) portion continuing the (a) portion at an 
area of not more than 50% of the total surface thereof, a 

releasing treatment layer does not exist on the inside surface 
of the (c) portion, and a pressure-sensitive adhesive layer (3,4) is 

formed on at least one surface of the inside surface of the (a) 
portion and the outside surface of the (c) portion.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to Z-shape pressure-sensitive
adhesive tapes which are suitably used as fixing
tapes for various articles, absorptive articles such as, for
example, paper diapers, napkins, and other sanitary articles,
disposable articles such as body warmers, etc., and fastening
tapes for fixing clothes, etc., and fastening systems and
sanitary absorptive articles using the pressure-sensitive
adhesive tapesIn particular, the present invention pertains to a Z-shape pressure sensitive adhesive
tape of the type as indicated in the preamble portion of claim 1. Such a pressure
sensitive adhesive tape is disclosed in FR-A-2 267 058.In particular, the Z-shape pressure-sensitive adhesive
tape described in JP-B-58-30401 is folded such that a 1st leg
(c) portion, a 2nd leg (b) portion, and a 3rd leg (a) portion
are constituted but a releasing treatment layer to the adhesive
formed on the 3rd leg (a) portion is formed on the surface only
of the 2nd leg (b) portion and a releasing treatment layer is
not formed on the outside surface of the 3rd leg (a) portion. 
Accordingly, when such a tape is wound in a roll form,
rewinding becomes impossible and a separator is required, which
give the problem that the pressure-sensitive adhesive tape is
inferior in the productivity and the economy.Also, since in the foregoing pressure-sensitive
adhesive tape, the 1st leg (c) is stuck to the 3rd leg (a) with
an adhesive by forming a penetrated hole at the central portion
of the 2nd leg (b) portion, there are problems that the
adhesive is exuded through such a penetrated hole to make
rewinding impossible and the tape becomes sticky at use to give
an unpleasant feeling to the consumers. Furthermore, it is
proposed to form a Z-shaped tape by connecting the 1st leg
portion to the 3rd leg portion by the pressure-sensitive
adhesive layer of each pressure-sensitive adhesive tape each
other as described in JP-B-52-47769. However, in this case,
there are faults that owing to the adhesion by the pressure-sensitive
adhesives each other, the adhesion is deteriorated by
heat and with the passage of time and is liable to be
disconnected and also when ordinary a strong shearing force or
a strong releasing force is applied, the adhered portion is
peeled and released.It is an object of the present invention to solve the problems of the prior art as described
above. Said object is achieved by the subject-matter of claim 1. Preferred embodiments
and further improvements of the present invention are defined in the depending
subclaims.

<CLAIMS>
A Z-shape pressure-sensitive adhesive tape folded into a Z-shape and
comprising a first horizontal portion (a), a second horizontal portion (c) and an

oblique arranged portion (b) which connects opposing ends of said (a) portion
and said (c) - portion,

wherein a pressure-sensitive adhesive layer (3 or 4) formed on at least one
surface of the inside surface of the (a) portion and the outside surface of the C-portion

is provided and wherein the (b) portion is temporarily joined to the
facing inside surface of the (c) portion,
characterized in that

a releasing treatment layer (2) is formed on the outside surface of the (a)
portion and on the surface of the (b) portion extending to the (a) portion in an

area of not more than 50% of the total surface of the (b) portion, whereas no
releasing treatment layer is provided on the inside surface of the (c) portion,

and

that it is said surface of the (b) portion, wherein the releasing treatment layer is
not provided, which is the one which is temporarily joined to the facing inside

surface of the (c) portion.
A Z-shape pressure-sensitive adhesive tape of claim 1, wherein the end of the
(a) portion folded into a Z-shape is projected or retreated from the bent portion

of the (b) portion and the (c) portion.
A Z-shape pressure-sensitive adhesive tape of claim 1, wherein the releasing
treatment layer (2) formed on the surface of the (b) portion folded into a Z-shape

and facing the pressure-sensitive adhesive layer (3) of the (a) portion is

partially lacked. 
A Z-shape pressure-sensitive adhesive tape of claim 1, wherein the releasing
treatment layer (2) formed on the surface of the (b) portion folded into a Z-shape

and facing the pressure-sensitive adhesive layer (3) of the (a) portion is
also formed on the inside surface of the continuing (a) portion and on the outer

surface of the (c) portion at an area of not more than 30% of the inside surface
of the (a) portion and the outside surface of the (c) portion, respectively.
A Z-shape pressure-sensitive adhesive tape of claim 1, wherein the left end
position of the pressure-sensitive adhesive layer of the (a) portion is same as

that of the pressure-sensitive adhesive layer of the (c) portion or is retreated to
