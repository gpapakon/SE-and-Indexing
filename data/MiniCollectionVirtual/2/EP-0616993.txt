<ABSTRACT>
Product quality productivity in a process for the continuous 
production of bisphenol-A (BPA) is increased by increasing the flow 

rate of reactants through the reactor and decreasing % 
acetone conversion in the presence of an ion exchange 

resin catalyst and an optional free mercaptan promoter.

<DESCRIPTION>
Bisphenol-A (BPA) is prepared by the reaction of 
phenol and acetone in the presence of an acidic 
catalyst, such as HCl or an ion exchange resin. During 
the reaction, a number of unwanted by-products and 
color are formed which affect yield and quality. The 
formation of such by-products and color is related to 
acetone concentration, retention time and temperature 
in the reactor. Some of the by-products are precursors 
of other impurities which can be formed in the various 
purification steps (distillations, crystallizations, 
etc.) used to produce the desired final product 
quality. Typically, the BPA reaction is run in such a way 
that all the acetone in the reactor feed stream is 
consumed till depletion to achieve the desired 
capacity. This results in high retention times with 
the subsequent formation of extra by-products. It is 
desired to reduce the retention time, the resulting 
unwanted by-products and minimize the color effects. The present invention is based upon the discovery 
that by increasing the throughput of the reactor, and 
taking advantage of high reaction rates in the 
beginning of the reaction (high acetone in the 
beginning versus the end), retention time in the 
reactor is reduced and a higher productivity per 
reactor is achieved. Also, a shift in by-products 
distribution occurs resulting in a reduction of non-isomerizables 
and therefore better quality and yield. In one embodiment, the invention is directed to a 
continuous process for the preparation of bisphenol-A  
 
(BPA) comprising the steps of contacting phenol and 
acetone in the presence of an acidic catalyst at a 
selected relatively high effluent stream flow rate 
sufficient to result in a decrease in acetone 
conversion and an initial increase in BPA production; 
and removing formed BPA and added acetone from the 
effluent stream after formation of BPA and prior to 
depletion of the acetone. Fig. 1 is a graphical representation of the 
pressure drop versus the weighted hourly space velocity 
(lbs reactor feed/hr/lbs dry catalyst) (WHSV) in a 
reactor used to evaluate the present invention; Fig. 2 is a graphical representation of acetone 
conversion versus WHSV in a reactor used to evaluate 
the present invention; and Fig. 3 is a graphical representation of relative 
productivity versus WHSV in a reactor used to evaluate

bisphenol-A (BPA) is continuously prepared by a 
reaction of phenol and acetone in the presence of an 
acidic catalyst under
