<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a ball joint for motor vehicles, with a bearing shell (30) composed of a flexible plastic which is inserted between a joint housing (40) and a ball head (2) of a ball-headed pin (1) capable of a rotational and a rocking motion and is supported by its outer surface in the joint housing (40), lubricating pockets (6) being formed on the inside of the bearing shell (30) under the influence of a prestress or loading on the joint. To reduce the release torque while, at the same time, obtaining improved lubrication and hence a longer life for the ball joint, the bearing shell (30) is provided on its surface resting against the joint housing (40) with a plurality of flats (34) or protrusions (35), these being distributed uniformly over the surface and, with the ball joint assembled, forming lubricating pockets (6 and 7) on the inside of the bearing shell (30), the side facing the smooth ball head (2), by virtue of the grease filling.

A ball joint for motor vehicles, comprising a bearing 
shell (30) of a resilient plastics material inserted 

between a joint housing (40) and the ball head (2) of 
a rotatable or tiltable ball-headed spindle (1), said 

bearing shell (30) being supported with its outer 
surface in the joint housing (40), wherein, under the 

influence of joint pretensioning or preloading, areas 
filled with lubricant are formed on the inside of the 

bearing shell (30), 
characterised in that
 the bearing 
shell (30) is provided, on its surface lying against 

the joint housing (40), with a plurality of flattened 
zones (34) distributed evenly over the surface and, 

when the ball joint is assembled, the outer surface of 
the bearing shell (30) lies against the joint housing 

(40) even in the area of the flattened zones (34) as a 
result of the lubricant filling and the resilience of 

the plastics material of the bearing shell (30) and 
lubrication pockets (6) are formed thereby on the 

inside of the bearing shell (30) facing the smooth 
ball head (2). 
A ball joint for motor vehicles comprising a bearing 
shell (30) of a resilient plastics material inserted 

between a joint housing (40) and the ball head (2) of 
a rotatable or tiltable ball-headed spindle (1), said 

bearing shell (30) being supported with its outer 
surface in the joint housing (40), wherein, under the 

influence of joint pretensioning or preloading, areas 
filled with lubricant are formed on the inside of the 

bearing shell (30), 
characterised in that
 the bearing 
shell (30) is provided, on its surface lying against 

the joint housing (40), with a plurality of circular 
or oval raised portions (35) distributed over the 

surface and, when the ball joint is assembled, the 
outer surface of the bearing shell (30) lies against 

the joint housing (40) not only in the area of the  
 

raised portions (35) but also in the areas between the 
raised portions (35) as a result of the lubricant 

filling and the resilience of the plastics material of 
the bearing shell (30) and lubrication zones (7) 

filled with lubricant are formed thereby on the inside 
of the bearing shell (30) facing the smooth ball h
ead 
(2), wherein an extensive area of lubricant results 

between ball head and bearing shell, which is 
interrupted by bearing points formed by the size and 

position of the raised portions. 
A ball joint according to claim 1 or claim 2, 

characterised in that
 the flattened zones (34) or 
raised portions (35) are arranged in several rows 

running up and down and from side to side over the 
spherical surface. 
A ball joint according to one of claims 1 to 3, 

characterised in that
 a protruding collar (32) is 
arranged on the outside of the bearing shell (30) so 

that the bearing shell (30) may be frictionally 
secured in the joint housing (40) by clamping by means 

of a locking ring (50). 
A ball joint according to claim 4, 
characterised in 
that
 the bearing shell (30) extends beyond the collar 
(32) in the direction of the ball-headed spindle (1). 
A ball joint according to claim 5, 
characterised in 
that
 flattened zones (34) or raised portions (35) 
forming lubrication pockets (6) or lubrication zones 

(7) respectively are also provided in the area of the 
extension (33).
