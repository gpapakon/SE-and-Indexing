<ABSTRACT>
A subterranean zone is cemented using set retarded 
ultra fine cement compositions which remain pumpable for a 

predictable period of time at temperatures up to about 400°F 
(205°C). The compositions basically comprise an ultra fine 

hydraulic cement, sufficient water to form a pumpable slurry 
and a set retarder comprised of a water soluble aliphatic 

compound containing at least three carbon atoms and at least 
one phosphonic acid or phosphonate group. The ultrafine 

cement has a particle size no greater than 30 micrometres 
and a Blaine Fineness of no less than 6000cm²/g.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates generally to a
method of cementing a subterranean zone.In cementing operations such as those carried out
in completing and repairing oil, gas and water wells, a
hydraulic cement composition is prepared by mixing a
hydraulic cement with water and other additives, the
composition is placed into a subterranean zone to be
cemented and allowed to set therein into a hard
substantially impermeable mass.In the operation of wells used in the recovery of
fluids from, or the introduction of fluids into,
subterranean formations, problems relating to the unwanted
passage of fluids and/or fine solids into or from
undesirable locations in the formation or wellbore sometimes
occur. This unwanted passage of fluids and/or fine solids
can severely disrupt or terminate the desired operation of a
well.The problems involving the unwanted passage of
fluids referred to above, ordinarily involve the movement of
fluids, such as oil, gas or water through very small
undesirable openings. These problems are not unique and the
solutions have traditionally involved apparatus, methods and
compositions adapted to cover, seal or to otherwise plug the 
openings to thereby terminate the unwanted passage of fluid
through the openings. The openings referred to above include:
holes or cracks in well casing; spaces such as holes, cracks,
voids or channels in the cement sheath deposited in the
annular space between the formation face and well casing; very
small spaces -- called microannuli -- between the cement
sheath referred to above, and the exterior surface of the well
casing or formation; and permeable spaces in gravel packs and
formations.It is clear that holes or cracks in well casing and/or
cement sheath can permit the unwanted and therefore
uncontrolled passage of fluids therethrough. Sometimes, of
course, holes are deliberately made in casing and sheath by a
known process called perforating in order to permit the
controlled recovery of fluid from a formation or to permit the
controlled introduction of fluid into a formation. The
sealing or plugging of such holes or cracks, whether or not
made deliberately, has been conducted by attempts to place or
otherwise force a substance into the hole or crack and
permitting it to remain therein to thereby plug the opening.
Naturally, the substance will not plug the opening if it will
not enter the opening. If the substance does not fit then, at
best, a bridge, patch, or skin may be formed over the opening
to produce, perhaps, a temporary termination of the
