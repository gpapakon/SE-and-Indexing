<CLAIMS>
Adjustable damping valve system for a vibration damper 
of a motor vehicle, which comprises two damping valves (2) 

which each consist of an axially displaceable control slide 
(5, 6), which can be actuated electromagnetically and 

cooperates with at least one through opening (21, 22), and 
a pressure-dep
endent valve (7, 8) for pulling and pushing 
stages, are disposed coaxially to each other in a 

substantially cylindrical valve housing (1) and can be 
connected to each other by way of flow channels (9),
 
characterised in that the component (15) which is formed in 

one or a plurality of parts and carries the 
pressure-dependent valves (7; 8) is fixed with its ends in 

a releasable or non-releasable manner in a central bore of 
the pole cores (17; 18) of the electromagnets (11) 

actuating the valve slides (5; 6). 
Damping valve system according to claim 1,
 
characterised in that the ends (19; 20) of the component 

(15) are screwed into the pole cores (17; 18). 
Damping valve system according to claim 1,
 
characterised in that the ends (19; 20) of the component 

(15) are passed through the central bore of the pole cores 
(17; 18) and fixed by a screw connection. 
Damping valve system according to one of claims 1 to 3,
 
characterised in that the valve slides (5; 6) are formed as 

a circular ring and disposed around the component (15). 
Damping valve system according to claim 4,
 
characterised in that the valve housing receiving the valve 

slides (5; 6) consists of non-magnetisable material.
