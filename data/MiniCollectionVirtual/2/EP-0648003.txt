<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a circuit arrangement for operating a load (La) 
from a supply voltage, provided with 


input terminals (K1, K2) for connection to poles of a supply voltage 
source, 
a circuit portion V for limiting an input current which flows through the 
input terminals owing to the supply voltage during operation, comprising a first field 

effect transistor S1 provided with two main electrodes and a gate electrode and coupled 
to an input terminal such that the input current flows through both main electrodes (K3, 

K4) of the field effect transistor S1 during operation. 
According to the invention, the first field effect transistor S1 is of the 
depletion FET type and is coupled to the input terminals of the circuit arrangement 

exclusively 
via
 the main electrodes. 
It is achieved thereby that the input current is limited by comparatively 
simple means.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a circuit arrangement for operating a load from a 
supply voltage, provided with 
input terminals for connection to poles of a supply voltage source, a circuit portion V for limiting an input current which flows through the 
input terminals owing to the supply voltage during operation, comprising a first field 
effect transistor S1 provided with two main electrodes and a gate electrode and coupled 
to an input terminal such that the input current flows through both main electrodes of 
the field effect transistor S1 during operation. Such a circuit arrangement is known from European Patent Application 
EP 375020. In the known circuit arrangement, the gate electrode of the field effect 
transistor is coupled to a control circuit which generates a signal on the gate electrode 
which is a measure for the instantaneous value of the supply voltage. When the supply 
voltage reaches a comparatively high value, the control circuit generates a signal on the 
gate electrode which causes the impedance of the field effect transistor between the two 
main electrodes to decrease. Since the input current flows through the two main 
electrodes of the field effect transistor, the increasing impedance of the field effect 
transistor between the main electrodes limits the input current. The known circuit 
arrangement is thus effectively protected against a comparatively high input current 
which may occur without protection in the case of supply voltage transients or as a 
switching-on effect. Such a comparatively high input current could shorten the 
operational life or even lead to the destruction of components of the circuit 
arrangement. A disadvantage of the known circuit arrangement is that the presence of a 
control circuit renders the circuit arrangement comparatively expensive and 
complicated. The invention has for its object to provide a circuit arrangement in which 
the circuit portion V for limiting the input current is realised in a comparatively 
inexpensive and simple manner.  A circuit arrangement of the kind mentioned in the opening paragraph is 
for this purpose characterized in that the first field effect transistor S1 is of the 
depletion FET type and is coupled to the input terminals of the circuit arrangement 
exclusively via the main electrodes. A circuit arrangement according to the invention has no control circuit for 
generating a signal for influencing the impedance of the field effect transistor between 
the main electrodes. Owing to the absence of a control circuit,
