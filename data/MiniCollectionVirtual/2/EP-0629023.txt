<ABSTRACT>
An electronic equipment drawer is aligned with an electrical connector 
in a tunnel in the horizontal and vertical directions with alignment 

pins and holes. A screw drive and cam mounted on the drawer 
engages a tunnel wall and controls insertion into the tunnel to provide 

proper electrical contact and lock the drawer in place in the tunnel. A 
bus extender card inserted in a connector centrally located on a 

mother board is supported by surfaces on a bar extending between 
end walls of the drawer. The end walls include pairs of channels on 

opposed walls which support feature cards inserted into connectors 
mounted on the bus extender card.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention is directed to the design and
structure of data terminal or the like which are easily serviced
when needed.In most instances data terminals such as point of sale
terminals include a number of components which are stacked or
assembled and inter connected at the point of use. When service
is required it is desirable to have access to replaceable units
within the covers without disrupting the interconnected
components. One technique for accomplishing this result is to
provide front access to the replaceable units.U.S. Patents 3,264,601 and 4,682,833 illustrate different
structures which allow insertion and removal of modular
components arranged in drawer like structures from one side (
front ) of a cabinet which contains a number of cells or tunnels
for receiving the drawers. The drawers, when inserted, engage
connectors in each cell or tunnel which are interconnected to
form a complete machine.In a point of sale terminal application it is essential to
utilize standard commercially available components wherever
possible to control and or reduce cost. In addition, the point of
sale terminal application imposes severe operating conditions,
especially so when vibration is considered. Each time a sale is
completed the cash drawer is opened automatically by the system
and closed by the sales clerk. Testing and past experience have
established that the cash drawer function involves significant
vibrational forces which are transferred to the electrical
components within the cabinet.In patent GBA2255841, the invention diclosed teaches a 
structure for mounting and supporting expansion cards comprising a base supporting
a mother card having expansion slots hereon and being limited by two vertical walls.
The expansion cards of this invention are fastened in the expansion slots of the
mother card. It appears that when the base of this mounting and supporting structure
forexpansion cards or feature cards of a point of sale terminal is part of the cash
drawer, these fastening means should be improved to be strong enough against said
vibrational forces.As for the drawer itself, since it obscures the view of the
connector when inserted in the tunnel it is necessary to align the drawer and the
connector in both the horizontal and vertical directions. This is can be accomplished
with locating pins and mating holes in the components to be aligned. However, in
addition it is necessary to provide the proper degree of insertion and a locking
mechanism to maintain proper electrical contact in the presence
</DESCRIPTION>
<CLAIMS>
An alignment mechanism for aligning in combination with a first connector (16)
mounted on the rear wall (14) of a cavity in an equipment cabinet with a

second connector (22) mounted on a drawer adapted to be inserted therein in
operative engagement comprising locking means (32); said alignment

mechanism comprising locating pins (18, 19) engaging the said rear wall of
the cavity and projecting into the said cavity, holes (20') mounted on a surface

of the drawer opposite the rear wall of the cavity and for engaging the said
pins as the drawer is inserted in the cavity to align the said second connector

on the drawer with the said first connector on the rear wall of the cavity in two
orthogonal directions in a plane parallel with the plane of the rear wall of the

cavity; said alignment mechanism being characterized by:

said locating pins (18, 19) being at least two rearward and two forward facing
locating pins;
said locking means (32) mounted on the drawer for engaging at least one
other wall of the cavity, comprising:


a screw (34) having a drive head;
a bracket (40) attached to the drawer supports the screw for free
rotation;
a cam member (36) threaded on the said screw; and means
engaging the cam and the screw for establishing a

predetermined friction therebetween whereby rotation of the
screw via the drive head causes the cam to rotate into

engagement with the said other wall of the cavity and further
rotation produces a force which drives the drawer into the 

cavity and the friction between the cam and the said other wall
locks the drawer in place.
The alignment mechanism of claim 1 in which the means engaging the cam
and screw for establishing a predetermined friction therebetween comprises a

spring (37) wrapped around the screw and having two free ends engaging
opposite surfaces of the cam.
The alignment mechanism of anyone of claims 1 or 2 in which
said cavity includes a substantially rectangular tunnel having a bottom wall

(13), a top wall (12) spaced therefrom and a pair of spaced side walls
connecting the said bottom and top walls;


said rear wall of the cavity includes a removable cover (14), a circuit card
attached to the removable cover, said circuit card including a pair of spaced

apertures and the said connector (16); and,
said locating pins means includes a first pair of locating pins (18) attached to
the tunnel and adapted to engage the apertures in the said circuit card for

locating the circuit card with respect to a second pair of locating pins (19)
adapted to engage the said second means (20') mounted on the drawer.
The alignment mechanism of anyoneone of claims 1 to 3 in use with an
equipment cabinet further comprising a mother board or circuit card (21), a

bus extender card (25) and at least one feature card (30) to be maintained in
operative contact with the bus extender card;

said alignment mechanism being characterized in that: 

said locking means being mounted on vertical side walls (33) of a base
member (23) forming the base of said drawer;
said base member supporting the said mother board;
said alignment mechanism further comprising:
a connector (26) being mounted on the mother board and electrically
connected to a bus on the mother board for receiving a bus extender card;
a pair of spaced opposed walls (24) extending vertically from said base, said
opposed walls being orthogonal to the bus extender card connector mounted

on the mother board and each including at least one feature card support
channel on the opposed walls in predetermined spaced relationship to each

other; and,
a bus extender card support means (28) connected to the pair of spaced
opposed walls and adapted to engage a bus extender card when installed to

restrict movement of the bus extender card.
The alignment mechanism of claim 4 in which said bus extender support
means includes:


at least one pair of spaced opposed surfaces for engaging opposite surfaces
of the bus extender card to restrict movement of the bus extender card in one

direction; and,
at least one surface for engaging another surface of the bus extender card to
restrict movement in another direction.
The alignment mechanism of anyone of claim 4 or 5 in which: 

the said bus extender card connector is centrally located on the mother board;
and,
the said spaced opposed walls are provided with the said predetermined
spaced pairs of feature card support channels on opposite sides of the said

centrally located bus extender card connector whereby feature cards can be
installed and supported on both sides of an installed bus extender card which

has been provided with connectors on both sides.
