<ABSTRACT>
A hydrophilic material comprising a copolymer composed of a monomer (A) having a polyalkylene oxide unit and a polymerizable 
carbon-carbon double bond in its molecule, a methacrylate or acrylate monomer (B) and another monomer (C) having 

a polymerizable carbon-carbon double bond in its molecule, which material is characterized by containing the monomer (C) 
in the proportion of 10 to 90 % by weight. The invention provides a hydrophilic material which is soluble, readily moldable, and 

excellent in antithrombotic and antifouling properties, and further provides an antithrombotic material and a semipermeable 
membrane. These materials can be appropriately used in the medical field and as water-absorbent and antifouling materials.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a novel hydrophilic
material and a semipermeable membrane made therefrom. The
material can be appropriately used as antithrombotic materials
etc. in the medical field and as water-absorbent materials and
antifouling materials.Recently, application of polymer materials to the
industrial and medical fields has been developed, and many
hydrophilic polymer materials have been used. Particularly,
they have been used as polymer materials insoluble to water and
having a water-absorbent property, various membranes having a
substance-permeable property, catheters, cannulas, sanitary
materials, contact lenses, blood preserving containers, blood
circuits, cell culture media, or capsules or fixing substrates
for enzymes or medicines. Further, such materials can be
applied not only to the medical field but also to supports for
cataphoresis or liquid chromatography and various coating
materials or materials for foods for preventing from fouling or
clouding.In such uses, antifouling property frequently becomes an 
important factor to the durability and quality of the materials.Especially, in a case where these membranes are used for
medical care and brought into contact with blood or body fluid,
material components such as platelets, leucocytes, erythrocytes
and fibroblasts inevitably adhere thereto, and there are fears
that these adhered components generate a thrombus on a surface
of a membrane coming into contact with blood and that the
components affect a complement. As a result, formation of a
thrombus or reduction of an immunity function is presumed to be
caused.As means for solving these problems, a hydrophilic
copolymer containing a polyethylene oxide chain was invented
(JP-A-SHO-57-164064), and a selectively permeable hollow fiber
composed of a copolymer containing an ethylene oxide chain was
invented (JP-A-SHO-60-22901). Further, it was found that a
semipermeable membrane composed of a hydrophilic acrylonitrile
copolymer containing a polyethylene oxide chain and
acrylonitrile was excellent in solute permeability and
antifouling property (JP-A-SHO-63-130103). Furthermore, a
plasma separative membrane excellent in compatibility with blood,
which was composed of a mixture of a copolymer containing an
ethylene oxide chain and isotactic methyl methacrylate polymer,
was invented.However, in a process for synthesizing a hydrophilic
copolymer containing a polyalkylene oxide chain, when 
copolymerized with an acrylic or methacrylic ester, in a case
where the content of polyalkylene
