<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a novel human Kunitz-type
protease inhibitor and variants thereof, DNA encoding the novel
inhibitor or variants, a method of producing the novel
inhibitor or variants and a pharmaceutical composition
containing the novel inhibitor or variants.Polymorphonuclear leukocytes (neutrophils or PMNS) and
mononuclear phagocytes (monocytes) play an important part in
tissue injury, infection, acute and chronic inflammation and
wound healing. The cells migrate from the blood to the site of
inflammation and, following appropriate stimulation, they
release oxidant compounds (O2•, O2-, H2O2 and HOCl) as well as
granules containing a variety of proteolytic enzymes. The
secretory granules contain, i.a., alkaline phosphatase,
metalloproteinases such as gelatinase and collagenase and
serine proteases such as neutrophil elastase, cathepsin G and
proteinase 3.Latent metalloproteinases are released together with tissue
inhibitor of metalloproteinase (TIMP) . The activation mechanism
has not been fully elucidated, but it is likely that oxidation
of thiol groups and/or proteolysis play a part in the process.
Also, free metalloproteinase activity is dependent on
inactivation of TIMP.In the azurophil granules of the leukocytes, the serine
proteases neutrophil elastase, cathepsin G and proteinase-3 are
packed as active enzymes complexed with glucosaminoglycans.
These complexes are inactive but dissociate on secretion to 
release the active enzymes. To neutralise the protease
activity, large amounts of the inhibitors α1-proteinase
inhibitor (α1-PI) and α1-chymotrypsin inhibitor (α1-ChI) are
found in plasma. However, the PMNs are able to inactivate the
inhibitors locally. Thus, α1-PI which is the most important
inhibitor of neutrophil elastase is sensitive to oxidation at
the reactive centre (Met-358) by oxygen metabolites produced
by triggered PMNs. This reduces the affinity of α1-PI for
neutrophil elastase by approximately 2000 times.After local neutralisation of α1-PI, the elastase is able to
degrade a number of inhibitors of other proteolytic enzymes.
Elastase cleaves α1-ChI and thereby promotes cathepsin G
activity. It also cleaves TIMP, resulting in tissue degradation
by metalloproteinases. Furthermore, elastase cleaves
antithrombin III and heparin cofactor II, and tissue factor
pathway inhibitor (TFPI) which probably promotes clot
formation. On the other hand, the ability of neutrophil
elastase to degrade coagulation factors is assumed to have the
opposite effect so that the total effect of
