condensation products and
esterification products of these resins or polymers

with (meth)acrylic acid.
Mixture according to one of Claims 1 to 6,

characterised in that
 the radically polymerisable
compound is a mixture of compounds whereof at least a

proportion comprises more than one polymerisable group
in the molecule or consists entirely of the latter.
Mixture according to Claim 7, 
characterised in that
 the
radically polymerisable compound is an ester of an α-,

β-unsaturated carboxylic acid, preferably acrylic or
methacrylic acid with a dihydric or polyhydric

monomeric or oligomeric alcohol.
