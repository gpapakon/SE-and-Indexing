<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a dewatering rail, a so-called foil (2), for the wire section in a paper making machine. More particularly said rail is of the kind being intended to be located transversely to the running direction (6) of the wire (4) with its upper surface in contact with the underside of the upper portion of the wire, said upper surface having a corrosion resistive, e.g. ceramic, layer (12) on a bed (14) of stainless steel or similar. The bed is a thin plate (14), which is supported by a longitudinal rigid supporting structure (16), which forms part of the foil.

<DESCRIPTION>
ED/HL 32541A foil for the wire section in a paper making machine.Technical area.The present invention relates to a dewatering rail, a so called foil, for the wire section in a paper making machine, said rail being intended to be applied transversely to the running direction of the wire with its upper surface in contact with the underside of the upper portion of the wire, said upper surface having a corrosion resistive, e.g. ceramic, layer on a bed of stainless steel or the like.Such a foil, also called register rail, is usually shaped with a somewhat convex upper surface such that during the dewatering of the pulp transported on the wire a negative pressure is formed in a wedge shaped space between the upper surface and the wire.State of the art. The pulp contains strongly corroding components and in operation the foil is exposed to hard mechanical stresses, this making great demands for the design of the foil with respect to its resistibility against corrosion as well as its mechanical strength, if a reasonable service life is desirable. Thus far, it has turned out in practice that this can only be attained against dramatically increased costs which is demonstrated by the three known main types of foil designs. These are:1. Foils consisting entirely of plastic rails having a service life of approximately two weeks and costing approximately 20.000 crowns per foil.2. Foils of stainless steel rails having a ceramic layer on their upper surface. These foils cost approximately 45000 crowns and have a service life of approximately two years. 3. All-ceramic foils costing approximately 90000 crowns. Their service life is restricted by the fact that they have a tendency to crack, but it exceeds that of the foils according to paragraph 2.The data given as an example for the three types of foils 

 are, of course, presupposed to apply under similar operational conditions for the respective foils.Description of the invention. The object of the invention has been to provide a foil of the kind defined by way of introduction, which has a service life of a couple of years, such as for the rail according to paragraph 2 above, but against considerably lower costs.In accordance with the invention this object has turned out to be attainable, surprisingly enough, by the fact that the bed of stainless steel or similar is a thin plate supported by a longitudinal rigid supporting structure forming part of the foil.Preferably, the supporting structure can be a plastic rail to which the plate is attached.By such an embodiment

A dewatering rail, a so called foil (2) , for the wire section in a paper making machine, said rail being intended to be located transversely to the running direction (6) of the wire (4) with its upper surface in contact with the underside of the upper portion of the wire, said upper surface having a corrosion resistive, e.g. ceramic layer (12) on a bed (14) of stainless steel or similar, characterised in that said bed is a thin plate (14) , which is supported by a longitudinal rigid supporting structure (16) , which forms part of the foil.
2. A dewatering rail according to claim 1, characterized in that the supporting structure (16) is made by plastics. 3. A dewatering rail according to claim 2, characterized in that the supporting structure is a plastic rail (16) , the thickness of which is great as compared with that of the bed plate (14).
4. A dewatering rail according to any of the preceding claims, characterized in that the plate (14) is recessed in the side of the supporting structure (16) facing the plate (Figure 1) .
5. A dewatering rail according to any of the preceding claims, characterized in that the plate (14) is supported along its longitudinal edges (18,20) by the supporting structure (16) .
6. A dewatering rail according to any of the preceding claims, characterized in that the longitudinal edges (18,20) of the plate (14) are bent inwardly under the plate. 7. A dewatering rail according to any of the preceding claims, characterized in that the plate (16) is attached to the supporting structure (16) by means of attaching joints, such as screw joints (18-30) arranged between and/or along the longitudinal edges of the plate.
