<ABSTRACT>
Device for connecting a monomode optical fibre made of F-doped (fluorine-containing) glass to a monomode silica optical fibre of core diameter different from that of the monomode silica optical fibre, these two fibres having substantially identical external diameters, characterised by the fact that it includes:   - a first length of F-doped glass fibre (1) and a second length of silica fibre (2), having substantially identical core diameters, lying between the core diameters of the fibres to be connected, and external diameters substantially identical to those of the fibres to be connected; - mechanical means for aligning and immobilising the two lengths of fibres (10, 11, 12), the facing ends (3, 4) of these lengths being cut obliquely and bonded by a resin, the value of the optical index of which is between those of the optical indices of the cores of the said lengths.

A device for connecting a monomode optical fiber made of fluoride
glass to a monomode optical fiber made of silica and having a core

diameter different from that of the fluoride-glass monomode optical
fiber, the outside diameters of the cladding of the two fibers being

substantially equal, the device being characterized by the fact that
it includes:


a first fiber length (1, 3) which is made of fluoride glass,
and a second fiber length (2, 4) which is made of silica, both having

substantially equal core diameters lying between the different core
diameters of the fibers to be connected, and both having cladding

outside diameters substantially equal to those of the fibers to be

connected, said two fiber lengths (1, 3; 2, 4) each having a first
end (7, 8) disposed facing the other first end and an opposite second

end intended to be fastened respectively to the fluoride-glass
monomode optical fiber and the silica monomode optical fiber, and
mechanical means (10-16) for aligning and holding said two
fiber lengths (1, 3; 2, 4), the facing ends (7, 8) of said lengths

being cut at a slant and being connected together by a resin (9)
having a refractive index of a value that lies between the values of

the refractive indices of the cores of said lengths.
A device according to claim 1 for connecting a fluoride-glass
monomode fiber having a core diameter of about 2 µm to a silica

monomode fiber having a core diameter of about 8 µm, both fibers
having a cladding outside diameter of about 125 µm, the device being

characterized in that the core diameters of both fiber lengths (1, 3;
2, 4) lie in the range 4 µm to 6 µm and their cladding outside

diameters are about 125 µm.
A device according to claim 1 or 2, characterized by the fact that
said first fiber length (1, 3) and said second fiber length (2, 4)

have substantially the same mode diameter.
A device according to any one of claims 1 to 3, characterized by
the fact that said fluoride glass is chosen from ZBLAN glass of 

formulation ZrF

A device according to any preceding claim, characterized by the
fact that neither of said two fiber lengths (1, 3; 2, 4) is provided

with a protective sheath at its facing end portion (3, 4), but is
provided with a protective sheath therebeyond, said holding means

(10-16) including, on a base (10), clamping means (11, 12) for
clamping the sheathed portions (1, 2) of the two fiber lengths, and

clamping means (13, 14) for clamping the bare portions (3, 4) of the
two fiber lengths in the vicinity of said ends (7, 8) to be

connected.
A device according to claim 5, characterized by the fact that said
alignment means (10-16) include, in the vicinity of said bare fiber

length portion (3, 4), alignment gauge rods (15, 16) made of tungsten
carbide.
