<ABSTRACT>
A memory card of the present invention serves as a 
reusable prepaid card. In the memory card, prepaid-money 

data is stored in a user memory (100) constituted 
of a flash erase EEPROM, and decreased as the card is 

used. When the prepaid-money data becomes zero, the 
user memory (100) is initialized. The memory card 

includes an EPROM (200) to which data of a predetermined 
number of times of initialization is preset and 

which decreases in data of the number of times of initialization 
and an initialization control logic (210) for 

executing initialization in response to an initialization 
command until data of the EPROM (200) becomes 

zero, and inhibiting the initialization even though the 
initialization command is input when the data becomes 

zero.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a memory card 
usable as a prepaid card or the like and, more 
particularly, to a memory card including a nonvolatile 
semiconductor memory capable of being rewritten or 
initialized to be reused. It is a magnetic card that has been used 
conventionally as the main stream of a prepaid card. 
The magnetic card is constituted such that a magnetic 
substance is applied to part of one side of a card 
substrate of plastics or the like and data corresponding 
to the amount of prepaid money is magnetically recorded 
on the magnetic part of the card substrate. The 
magnetic card has the drawback wherein it is easy to be 
counterfeited because of simple structure and low cost 
for counterfeit, though its manufacturing cost is low. 
To eliminate the drawback, an IC memory card (simply 
referred to as a memory card hereinafter) mounted with 
an IC memory has recently been used as a prepaid card 
since the memory card is so high in cost for counterfeit 
that it cannot be counterfeited. In the memory card, a 
memory section (memory cell) for recording data is constituted 
of fuse memories incapable of being rewritten, 
and the amount of used money is counted and recorded by 
disconnection of the fuse memories. However, if, in the above memory card, the prepaid 
money are completely spent, all the fuse memories are  
 
cut off, and the memory card has to be thrown away 
since it cannot be used any more. The memory card is 
therefore unfavorable for protection of resources and 
prevention of environmental pollution. Since, 
furthermore, the memory card cannot be reused, its own 
manufacturing cost is increased. The fuse memories can be replaced with an EEPROM 
(Electrically Erasable Programmable ROM) in order to 
reuse the prepaid card. If, however, a rewrite 
operation is allowed without restriction, the 
following drawback occurs: In case a write command 
leaks out to a user, the user is likely to rewrite the 
EEPROM and to use the prepaid card without 
restriction. The present invention has been developed in 
consideration of the above situation and its object is 
to provide a new, improved memory card which can be 
reused without dishonesty. A memory card according to the present invention 
comprises:
 
   memory means capable of being initialized;
 
   initialisation means for initializing the memory 
means upon receiving an initialization command;
 
   count means for counting the number of times the 
memory means is initialized by the initialization 
means; and
 
   initializatio

<CLAIMS>
A memory card comprising: 
   memory means (100) capable of being initialized; 

and 
   means (110, 120) for initializing said memory 

means upon receiving an initialization command, 
characterized by comprising: 

   means (200) for counting the number of times said 
memory means is initialized by said initializing 

means; and 
   initialization control means (210) for, when the 

number of times counted by said counting means is 
equal to or larger than a predetermined value, 

inhibiting said initializing means from being 
operated. 
The memory card according to claim 1, 
characterized by comprising: 

   means (160) for storing a key necessary for 
initializing said memory means; 

   means (150) for verifying whether the a input by 
an operator coincides with the key stored in said 

storing means, and allowing said initializing means to 
be operated when both the keys coincide with each 

other. 
The memory card according to claim 1 or 2, 
characterized in that said memory means includes a 

flash erase type EEPROM. 
The memory card according to claim 1 or 2, 
characterized in that said memory means includes a 

flash erase type EEPROM having a large number of 
memory cells, a predetermined number of memory cells 

of said large number of memory cells being set to a 
first level in an initial state and changed in 

sequence from the first level to a second level, and 
   said initializing means simultaneously changes 

levels of said predetermined number of memory cells to 
 

the first level. 
The memory card according to claim 1 or 2, 
characterized in that said counting means includes an 

EPROM whose data is rewritten every initialization of 
said memory means. 
The memory card according to claim 1 or 2, 
characterized in that said counting means includes a 

large number of fuses, and one of said large number of 
fuses is cut off every initialization of said memory 

means. 
The memory card according to claim 1 or 2, 
characterized in that said counting means includes a 

counter which is cleared before a first initialization 
of said memory means starts and which counts up every 

initialization of said memory means. 
The memory card according to claim 1 or 2, 
characterized in that said memory means stores prepaid 

money data. 
The memory card according to claim 1 or 2, 
characterized in that said counting means includes a 

wired logic circuit, and said initialization control 
means includes a logic gate for supplying the 

initialization command to said initializing means, 
said logic gate being rendered nonconductive when the 

number of times of initialization amounts to the 
predetermined value.
