<DESCRIPTION>
Field of the Invention - This invention pertains 
broadly to child resistant dispensing closures. More particularly, 
this invention relates to a child resistant dispensing 
closure including a cap and a spout, wherein the spout is 
rotatably mounted within a cavity formed in the cap. A passageway 
extends axially through the spout, and the cap is secured to 
a container. The spout can be manually rotated between (1) an 
open position in which the passageway in the spout is aligned 
with an opening through the top of the cap, so that the contents 
of the container can be discharged, and (2) a closed position in 
which the spout closes off the opening through the cap and 
precludes discharge. Description of the Prior Art - Dispensing closures of 
the type having a cap and a rotatable spout, are known in the 
prior art. One example of such prior art closures is shown in 
U.S. Patent 4,209,114, issued on June 24, 1980, to Woodrow S. 
Wilson et al. The Wilson et al patent is directed to a dispensing 
closure including a cap member which is provided with aligned 
bearings and a rotatable spout having trunnions fitting within 
the bearings. However, such dispensing closure tended to be 
relatively easy to open, and thus presented limited protection 
against unauthorized access by children or other individuals of 
reduced mental capacity who could not recognize the potential 
danger of the product that could be discharged through the spout. Consequently, to satisfy safety concerns expressed by 
government agencies, private organizations concerned with child 
safety and health issues, and the safety-conscious public, 
inventors attempted to provide child resistant features on 
dispensing closures of the rotatable spout type. Illustrative 
child resistant closures are set forth in U.S. Patent 3,957,181,  
 
issued May 18, 1976, to Robert Hazard, and in U.S. Patent 
4,756,451, issued July 12, 1988, to Woodrow S. Wilson. U.S. Patent 3,957,181 on which the preamble of claim 1 is based discloses a child resistant 
dispensing closure having a spout which fits entirely within an 
elongated groove in a cap when the spout is in a closed position. 
The end of the spout which is normally engaged to move the spout 
between open and closed positions is located within the groove. 
Spout movement is initiated by applying pressure to a portion of 
the spout remote from the latter end of the spout. U.S. Patent 4,756,451 discloses a child resistant 
dispensing closure having a cap and a spout mounted thereon 
for rotation about
</DESCRIPTION>
<CLAIMS>
A child-resistant closure (10, 110) for a container for a liquid intended to be 
dispensed through the closure when open, the closure consisting of a cap (12, 112) 

having: an end wall (30, 130); a dependent skirt (18, 118) adapted to be secured to 
the neck (24, 124) of a container (26, 126) in a fluid-tight manner, and a spout (14, 

114) pivotally mounted in a recess (32, 132) in the end wall for movement between 
an open and a closed position, the recess having in its base a discharge opening 

(52, 152) sealed by the spout when in its closed position, the spout being hollow to 
define a discharge passage (42, 142) which is placed in communication with the 

discharge opening by the spout's being pivoted towards its fully-open position, the 
spout having on its outer surface a flat area which is substantially flush with the 

outer surface of the end wall when the spout is in its closed position, the spout 
having at one end of the flat area a transverse rib (50, 150) for enabling the user to 

apply force to the spout to pivot it out of its closed position,
 
   characterised in that: 


the end wall (30, 130) is canted at an acute angle to the plane in which lies 
the inner end of the skirt; 
the boundaries of the end wall are interconnected with the nearer end of the 
skirt by means of a transition section (16, 116); 
a protective flange (66, 166) circumscribes the canted end wall to provide a 
recess of which the base is formed by the end wall and spout, and 
the flange is integral with the cap, projects above the end wall, and is 
sufficiently stiff to resist flexure and distortion by forces applied to it digitally. 
A closure as claimed in claim 1, characterised in that the transition section 
(16, 116) is part-conical. 
A closure as claimed in claim 1 or 2, characterised in that the flange (66, 166) 
is of non-uniform height above the end wall, its height being greater in the region of 

the pivotal end of the spout than in the region of its discharge end.  
 
A closure as claimed in any preceding claim, in which the outer surface of the 
flange is continuous with the outer surface of the transition section. 
A closure as claimed in claim 4, in which the flange (166) and transition 
section (116) together form the frustum of a cone. 
A closure as claimed in any preceding claim, in which the end wall has on its 
outer surface, on each side of the recess housing the spout, a series of ribs (56, 58, 

60, 62, 156, 158, 160, 162) spaced apart from each other and parallel to the axis of 
the rib (50, 150) on the spout by which force may be applied to move the spout out 

of its closed position. 
A closure as claimed in claim 6, in which a second rib (48, 148) projects from 
the flat area of the spout at a region located between the ends of the flat area. 
A closure as claimed in any preceding claim, in which the outer end of the 
spout has a ledge (46, 146) projecting from it, to which ledge a user may apply force 

to move the spout manually from a partly-open position to its fully-open position.
