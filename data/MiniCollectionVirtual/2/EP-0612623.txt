<ABSTRACT>
An ink droplet jet device in which the volume 
of the ink channels is varied by deformation of the side 

walls due to piezoelectric thickness shear mode to thereby 
jet an ink droplet require
s sufficient volume variation of 
the ink channels to function reliably. To satisfy this 

requirement, the material and thickness of an adhesive 
agent used to secure the piezoelectric plate to the cover 

plate is selected so that the value obtained by dividing 
Young's modulus of adhesive agent for adherence between 

the upper surface of the side wall of the piezoelectric 
plate and the cover plate by the thickness of the adhesive 

agent is above 5 X 10³ kg/mm³, preferably 5 X 10⁴ kg/mm³, 
and more preferably above 1.2 X 10⁵ kg/mm³. Further, the 

material and thickness of the adhesive agent is selected 
so that the value obtained by dividing Young's modulus of 

the adhesive agent for adherence between the end surface 
of the side wall and the nozzle plate by the thickness of 

the adhesive agent is below 1 X 10⁶ kg/mm³, preferably 5 X 
10⁵ kg/mm³, and more preferably 3 X 10⁵ kg/mm³. By these 

settings, the jet velocity of the ink droplet is above a 
predetermined value, and stable ink droplet jetting can be 

performed.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to an ink droplet jet device
capable of stably jetting ink droplets at all times.Conventionally, a drop on-demand ink droplet jet
device uses a piezoelectric ceramic element. This
device is designed such that the volume of an ink channel
is varied to jet ink in the ink channel through a nozzle
when the volume of the channel is reduced and to introduce
ink into the ink channel through an ink inlet port
when the volume of the channel is increased. In this
device, ink is jetted from a jetting device at a predetermined
position according to print data to form desired
characters or images.Such an ink droplet jet device is disdosed in U.S.
Patent No. 5,016,028. The construction of this ink droplet
jet device is described below.As shown in Fig. 3, an ink jet printer head 1 comprises
a piezoelectric ceramic plate 2, a cover plate 3, a
nozzle plate 31, and a base plate 41.The piezoelectric ceramic plate 2 is formed with
plural grooves 8 by cutting the plate 2 with a thin disk-shaped
diamond blade or the like. A side wall 11, which
serves as a side surface for the grooves 8, is polarized
in a direction as indicated by an arrow 5. These grooves
8 are designed to have the same depth and to be
arranged in parallel to one another. The depth of the
grooves 8 gradually decreases and becomes more
shallow toward one end surface 15 of the piezoelectric
ceramic plate 2 to form shallow grooves 16 near the end
surface 15. Further, metal electrodes 13 are formed at
upper half portions of both side surfaces of the inner
surface of each groove 8 by a sputtering method or the
like. In addition, metal electrodes 9 are formed at the
side surfaces and the bottom surface of the inner surface
of each shallow groove 16 by the sputtering
method or the like. With this construction, the metal
electrodes 13 formed at both side surfaces of the
groove 8 are linked to the metal electrodes 9 formed at
the shallow groove 16.The cover plate 3 is formed of ceramic material or
resin material. An ink inlet port 21 and a manifold 22 are
formed in the cover plate 3 by polishing or cutting. The
surface at the worked side of the groove 8 of the piezoelectric
ceramic plate 2 and the surface at the worked
side of the manifold 22 of the cover plate 3 are adhesively
attached to each other through an adhesive agent
from the epoxy group or the like (see Fig. 6). Accordingly,
in the ink jet printer head 1, the grooves 8 are covered
at the upper surfaces thereof to form plural ink
channels 12 (Fig. 6) that are arranged in a lateral
