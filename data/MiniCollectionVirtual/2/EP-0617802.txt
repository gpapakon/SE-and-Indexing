<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to photographic silver
halide emulsions and specifically to emulsions which
contain filter dyes for improved resolution. This
invention relates more specifically to photographic
emulsions which contain diketo azo filter dyes.It is well known in the art of photographic science
to add dyes to the structure of a photographic element
in such a way as to absorb light from different regions
of the electromagnetic spectrum. These dyes can be used
to inhibit light from reaching a spectrally sensitized
emulsion by a number of means including, but not limited
to, being situated between the exposing source and the
spectral sensitive emulsion. This method is typically
employed in the art of color photography to ensure
proper color balance as illustrated, for example, in
Research Disclosure, No. 308, December 1989, Item
308119. Photographic elements are also known in which
the filter dye is situated in such a manner as to absorb
light which has passed through a spectrally sensitized
emulsion layer. Exemplary examples of this application
are presented when the dyes are used in underlayer or
backing layer as illustrated, for example, in Research
Disclosure, No. 308, December 1989, Item 308119.
Photographic elements are also known in the art which
utilize a filter dye, as exemplified by C-1, within the
bounds of a photosenstitve silver halide layer, e.g. EP-A-0
126 324 discloses a photographic material containing an
azo filter dye. Dyes 
within the bounds of the photosensitive absorb radiation
which is scattered within the layer as well as radiation
which exits the layer. The radiation which exits the
emulsion is referred to in the art as print-through
radiation. These prior art dyes are deficient due to
the excessive loss of speed which occurs when the dyes
are utilized within the bounds of the photographic
layer.
The fundamental properties of any said filter dye
include, but are not limited to, (a) an ability to wash
out or bleach during processing to insure that residual
color is not imparted to the final image and (b)
photographic inactivity such that no adverse
sensitometric effects are observed such as fog or
desensitization.Through diligent efforts a new class of diketo azo
filter dyes have been discovered which have excellent
photographic properties and can be utilized in any of
the photographic structures currently known in the art.A dye is detailed which is particularly suitable
for providing a photographic element with improved
resolution by decreasing the blue and ultraviolet 
radiatio
