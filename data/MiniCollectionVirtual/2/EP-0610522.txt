<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a silver halide photographic material
having a support, at least one light-sensitive silver halide emulsion layer and at
least one outer light-insensitive layer comprising a dispersion of polymer particles
as matting agents. In another aspect the invention relates to a method of producing
polymer particles and more particularly to the production of polymer particles
having a narrow particle size distribution.In the field of photography, water-insoluble matting agents have been
used in top or back hydrophilic layers of silver halide light-sensitive materials to
prevent adhesion when materials are stored in rolls, cartridges or cassettes in
conditions of relatively high humidity and temperature, to prevent electrostatic
charges by reducing the area of contact of the photographic material, to prevent
the formation of Newton's rings during printing and enlargement, or to decrease the
occurrence of scratches during storage or packing of the photographic material.It is well known in the art that, in order to solve these problems, fine
particles of inorganic substances such as silicon dioxide, magnesium oxide,
calcium carbonate and the like, or organic substances such as polymethylmethacrylate,
cellulose acetate propionate and the like are incorporated as
matting agents into the outermost layers of a photographic material. These and
other matting agents are described, for example, in US 3,411,907 and GB 837,529.
Said matting agents are insoluble in alkaline processing solutions and remain in the
processed photographic material.In same cases it is desired to remove the matting agent for the purposes
of improving transparency and graininess of the final image. Therefore, matting
agents insoluble in neutral or acidic solutions and soluble in alkaline medium have
been described in the art. In particular, alkali-soluble matting agents consisting of
methacrylic acid - methylmethacrylate copolymers have been described in US 
2,391,181, US 2,992,101, US 3,767,448, US 4,142,894, and in GB 878,520, and
copolymers of styrene and α,β-ethylenically unsaturated carboxy containing monomers
have been described in GB 1,055,713. Such matting agents are incorporated
in the photographic layers in the form of discrete particles by dispersing a solution
of the matting agent in a water-insoluble organic solvent in an aqueous gelatin solution,
eliminating the organic solvent, and then introducing the obtained dispersion
into the coating composition of the photographic layer. Alkali-soluble matting
