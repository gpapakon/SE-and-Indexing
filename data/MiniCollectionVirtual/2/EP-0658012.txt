<ABSTRACT>
In a signal processing method to compress digital audio 
data by a block floating process, encoding/decoding 

apparatuses of a digital signal prevents sound quality of a 
digital audio signal from being deteriorated and improves a 

compression ratio of the digital audio signal when the digital 
audio signal is converted on a frequency axis per 

predetermined time frame, and data on the frequency axis is 
then divided into a plurality of blocks to be recorded, 

otherwise, bits is then allocated per block to compress the 
digital audio signal for minimizing transmitted parameters.

efficient encoding/decoding without recording or transmitting 

the word length to obtain a high-quality audio signal by 
allocating bits to allow quantization data of a spectrum 

signal to occupy the area held by the word length.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a signal processing 
method to compress digital audio data by a block floating 
process, and more particularly to encoding/decoding 
apparatuses of a digital signal suitable for preventing sound 
quality of a digital audio signal from being deteriorated and 
improving a compression ratio of the digital audio signal when 
the digital audio signal is converted on a frequency axis per 
predetermined time frame, and data on the frequency axis is 
then divided into a plurality of blocks to be recorded, 
otherwise, bits is then allocated per block to compress the 
digital audio signal for minimizing transmitted parameters, 
and encoding/decoding methods thereof. A high efficiency coding method with respect to a digital 
audio signal includes a subband coding (hereinafter referred 
to as "SBC") method that divides a signal on the time axis of 
an audio signal to a plurality of frequency bands to codes the 
divided signals, and an adaptive transform coding (ATC) method 
that vertically transforms a signal on a time axis to a signal 
on a frequency axis to divide the signal into a plurality of  
 
frequency bands and adaptively code to respective bands. FIG. 1 is a block diagram showing a conventional digital 
data encoder adopting the adaptive transform coding method. As shown in FIG. 1, the conventional digital data encoder 
includes a PCM data block circuit 1 for dividing received 
spectrum data PCM to sub-blocks on several time axis, and a 
band-split filter 2 for dividing output data from the PCM data 
block circuit 1 per predetermined frequency as in SBC. 
Furthermore, a time/frequency converter 3 receives output data 
per frequency band from the band-split filter 2 to convert the 
received data into a frequency axis perpendicular to the time 
axis, thereby outputting spectrum data, and a scale factor 
operator 4 allows the spectrum data from the time/frequency 
converter 3 to be blocks for obtaining scale factor SF per 
block. A masking level operator 5 searches out a tonal 
component of the spectrum data, i.e., spectrum data of a 
specific sound, from the time/frequency converter 3 and 
obtains a masking level to calculate a minimum masking level 
per block. A bit allocation operator 6 determines to output a 
word length WL to allocate bits per blocks for generating a 
quantization error smaller than the masking level from the 
masking level operator 5. Also, a parameter operator 7 obtains 
parameters by means of a signal from the masking level 
operator 5 and bit
