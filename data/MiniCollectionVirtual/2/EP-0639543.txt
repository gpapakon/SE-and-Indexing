<ABSTRACT>
A process for removing binder from a body 
comprising ceramic particles and binder by heating the 

body at a substantially constant rate of temperature 
rise over the temperature range where a peak rate of 

body weight loss occurs in a gaseous environment of 
inert gas and oxidizer wherein the oxidizer 

concentration varies with the rate of temperature rise 
to reduce the peak rate of body weight loss.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to the thermal removal of
binder from green bodies of ceramic particles and
binder, more specifically to tolerable rates of green
body temperature rise in combination with oxidizer
concentration in a debinding environment of inert gas
and oxidizer.Ceramic structures are typically formed by
initially combining a binder with ceramic particles or
ceramic powder to form a malleable mixture. The
mixture is shaped by one or more of a variety of
processes, such as injection molding, extrusion, or
tape casting into a green body. The green body is
subsequently heated, usually in air, to drive out the
binder and to sinter the ceramic particles together to
form the desired structure. During the initial stages
of heating, typically to approximately 800K, binder
evolves from the body by thermal decomposition and
evaporation.The debinding phase of the heating is critical in
the formation of sound ceramic structures. During the
debinding phase, body damage such as bloating, internal
pores or cracks may be produced by the internal
pressure exerted by the evolving gas. The possibility
of damage is increased by using submicron particles
recently introduced for advanced ceramic components. In an effort to avoid damages during heat treatment of the
ceramic body, US-A-5 078 929 discloses a process for removing
organic binder contained in a ceramic products, in which process the
ceramic product is heated within a furnace in the presence of a
surrounding gas containing oxygen, a parameter in the gas phase,
such as carbon monoxide concentration of a cracked gas being
generated by thermal decomposition of the organic binder, is
measured and a temperature gradient at which the ceramic product
is heated as well as the amount of surrounding gas being supplied to
the furnace is controlled, based upon the monitored carbon monoxide
concentration of the cracked gas.To avoid debinding damage to the body, low rates
of body temperature rise are usually employed which
result in undesirably long processing time. Often the
debinding is conducted by moving bodies continuously
through a furnace having a long heating path. However 
body temperature rise rate is difficult to control,
and, particularly to vary in a selected schedule,
during the course of travel of the bodies through such
a furnace.To reduce debinding time, several methods have
been employed in the prior art. One approach disclosed
in European Patent Office Publication Number 325,317
has been to continuously weigh a batch of bodies during
heating in a
