<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to an internal combustion engine with a cylinder crankcase which has at least one cylinder covered by a cylinder head, in which cylinder a piston, articulated by means of a connecting rod on a crankshaft supported in the cylinder crankcase, is capable of moving, the internal combustion engine having cooling oil chambers, a lubrication system and an oil pump, which are flow-connected in series. The object of the invention is to simplify the oil circuit of the said internal combustion engine, thereby reducing its cost. The object is achieved in that each cylinder has a cylinder cooling chamber and each cylinder head a head cooling chamber, the individual cylinder cooling chambers and the individual head cooling chambers being interconnected and the cylinder cooling chambers and the head cooling chambers as a whole being connected in series.
