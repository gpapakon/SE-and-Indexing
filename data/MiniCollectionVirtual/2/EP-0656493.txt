<ABSTRACT>
A transmission has a manual selector valve 
(128) which is reciprocally and rotatably mounted in a 

valve body (148) and operable in a conventional "H" 
shift pattern to permit selection of first to fifth 

forward drive ratios, a neutral condition and a 
reverse drive ratio in a planetary transmission. The 

selector valve (128) has a line pressure chamber (152) 
formed thereon which remains in fluid communication 

with a line feed passage in the valve body (148) 
throughout the "H" pattern. This line pressure 

chamber (152) is selectively alignable with respective 
clutch and brake apply passages formed in the valve 

body (148) to control the flow of pressurised oil for 
the engagement of respective clutches and brakes. A 

plurality of exhaust chambers (162,164) formed therein 
are also selectively connectable with the clutch and 

brake apply passages to control disengagement of the 
clutches and brakes not required for the selected 

drive condition.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a manual selector 
valve for a transmission. In the preferred embodiment, the invention 
relates to a manual control valve for a planetary-type 
transmission operated in a mechanical gear selection 
scheme. Manually controlled planetary transmissions 
have been proposed in the past. These transmissions 
have been controlled with a manual valve having 
substantially the same structure as manual valves used 
with comparable automatic shifting planetary 
transmissions. These valves use straight line or 
linear movement to establish the passages to be 
connected with the high pressure or main pressure 
circuit so that appropriate clutches and brakes are 
actuated. While these mechanisms perform 
satisfactorily, they do require more space in the 
longitudinal direction of the selector lever travel 
when compared with the "H" pattern of a conventional 
manual control used with a countershaft type 
transmission. The present invention seeks to provide an 
improved transmission selector valve. According to an aspect of the present 
invention, there is provided a manual selector valve 
for a transmission as specified in claim 1. In the preferred embodiment, there is 
provided an "H" pattern in a manual control for a 
planetary type transmission, which uses an input 
clutch in place of a torque converter. To compensate 
for the reduction in overall torque ratio coverage in 
this embodiment, an underdrive ratio is provided by 
placing a two speed planetary at the input axis of the 
multi-speed planetary. This planetary set can provide  
 
increased torque ratio in both the forward ratios, 
except for the highest and the reverse ratio. The "H" 
shift pattern preferably adapted can reduce the 
longitudinal space required by the shift mechanism by 
adding rotary movement to the manual shift valve. The 
formation of a pressure chamber on the manual valve 
permits the porting of high pressure fluid to the 
appropriate clutches and brake members. Exhaust 
chambers are preferably interspersed with and adjacent 
to the pressure chamber to allow depressurisation of 
the clutch and brake members not required to establish 
the operator selected ratio. Preferably, a spool valve is mounted for 
rotary and longitudinal movement in a valve body, such 
that an "H" pattern can be provided for the driver. An embodiment of the present invention is 
described below, by way of example only, with 
reference to the accompanying drawings, in which:

</DESCRIPTION>
<CLAIMS>
A manual selector valve for a 
transmission which includes a source of pressure and a 

plurality of drive ratios established by the 
engagement of fluid operated friction devices, the 

manual selector valve comprising a valve body portion 
(148) including a bore (130) comprising a main passage 

(124) operable to communicate with the bore and a 
source of pressure, a plurality of control passages 

operable to communicate with the bore and respective 
fluid operated friction devices; valve spool means 

(28) reciprocally and rotatably disposed in the bore 
for providing selective communication between the 

pressure source and selective combinations of the 
control passages through a pressure chamber (152) 

formed on the valve spool means and bounded by the 
bore to control fluid distribution from the source to 

selective fluid operated friction devices and for 
providing selective fluid communication between an 

exhaust chamber means (162,164) formed on the valve 
spool means and passages disconnected from the source 

so as to exhaust the fluid operative friction devices 
in communication with the disconnected passages. 
A manual selector valve according to 
claim 1, comprising first lever means (136) for 

selectively importing linear movement of the valve 
spool means; and second lever means (146) for 

importing rotary movement of the valve spool means.
