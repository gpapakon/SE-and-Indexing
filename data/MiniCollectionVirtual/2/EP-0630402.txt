<ABSTRACT>
An enzyme designated as ketonic ester reductase capable of being used in the NADH-dependent enzymatic reaction of  beta ,  gamma  and delta  ketonic acid esters into the corresponding optically active beta ,  gamma  and  delta  hydroxycarboxylic acid esters can be isolated from strains of Candida parapsilosis, Yarrowinia cellobiosa, Rhodococcus erythropolis or Pseudomonas acidovorans, preferably cultivated on a long-chain alkane and/or alkane acid-containing culture medium, appropriately in the presence of an inductor. An usable enzyme preparation can be recovered by fractionated PEG-precipitation from the cell raw extract; high specific activities (for example 1855 U/mg) may then be obtained by chromatographic purification. The enzyme is characterized by a wide substrate spectrum. Not only (possibly substituted) so-called ketonic esters are accepted, but also a number of other oxo-compounds, among which diketones, (possibly substituted, in particular halogenated) aliphatic, alicyclic and aromatic ketones, as well as ketoacetals and aldehydes. The S-enantiomer-forming reduction is supplemented by the possibility to recover R-enantiomers from racemates by oxidizing the S-enantiomer and separating the oxo-compound.
