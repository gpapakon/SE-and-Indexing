<ABSTRACT>
Increased network security is provided by monitoring (in 28) in real
time one or more characteristics or attributes of telephone calls that are placed

through the network (10) and notifying the network customer, (at 38, 42 or 44), in
real time, when the attributes are indicative of abnormal or fraudulent network

usage. The subscriber, once notified of the abnormal usage, is in a position to take
steps to minimize unauthorized network usage. For example, the subscriber can

selectively block network usage, deny access to the network on a call-by-call basis,
or trace the call to catch the unauthorized user while the call is still in progress.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to systems for monitoring usage on a telecommunications
network and, more particularly, to systems for monitoring network usage in real time.There are currently many situations in which telecommunications networks are used
by individuals without authorization. This unauthorized use places a large financial burden
on the entity which owns the network or pays for use of the network. Certain
telecommunications networks, such as those networks which allow access to network facilities
through the use of an authorization code or toll-free telephone number ("800 number"), are
particularly susceptible to such unauthorized use. A Software Defined Network (SDN) is one
example of such a telecommunications network. A SDN is a network in which shared
transmission and switching facilities are configured under software control through the use of
a database to provide a network customer (hereafter referred to as "the subscriber") with the
capabilities of a private network. SDNs having a "remote access" capability allow access to
the software-defined private network facilities from off-network locations. This feature is
useful, for example, for allowing a businessperson traveling outside company premises to gain
access to the company's private network. Though useful and convenient, this remote access
capability may present a security risk to the network customer (hereafter referred to as "the
subscriber") who is responsible for paying for network usage. In particular, the same
authorization code that gives the businessperson access to the network can be used by
unauthorized users to gain access to the network.Current methods for detecting and preventing unauthorized use of a communications
network have not adequately addressed the problem. For example, systems which detect fraud
based on data obtained at the end of the billing cycle do not provide sufficiently timely
information. By the time the information becomes available to the owner of the private
network, large amounts of fraudulent usage could already have occurred. Other methods for
dealing with the problem of unauthorized use involve automatically denying or blocking
access to the network when abnormal use is detected. Systems which use this technique may
annoy valid users of the network whose authorized calls are blocked inadvertently. Also,
systems which automatically deny access encourage "hackers" seeking access to the network 
to try other authorisation codes or points of entry to the network. Such systems do not
provide a means for

<CLAIMS>
A method of monitoring use of a communications network (18) to detect
abnormal use thereof, the method comprising the steps of:


a) receiving a plurality of predetermined attributes (54-1...54-N) of a telephone
call; and
b) processing the plurality of attributes to identify abnormal use;

   characterised in that the plurality of attributes are received in real time; and in
that the method further comprises notifying a subscriber (12) in real time of the

occurrence of the abnormal use.
A method as claimed in claim 1, wherein the plurality of predetermined
attributes (54-1...54-N) are received while the call is in-progress.
A method as claimed in claim 1, wherein the processing step comprises:

comparing selected ones of the plurality of attributes (54-1 ...54-N) with
corresponding predetermined thresholds, the predetermined thresholds being indicative

of abnormal network use; and
returning an indication that the call represents an abnormal use of the network if
any of the selected ones of the plurality of attributes exceeds its corresponding

predetermined threshold.
A method as claimed in claim 3, wherein the plurality of predetermined
thresholds are indicative of abnormal use for calls originating from a predetermined

originating telephone number.
A method as claimed in claim 3, wherein the plurality of predetermined
thresholds are indicative of abnormal use for calls placed using a predetermined

authorisation code. 
A method as claimed in claim 3, wherein the plurality of predetermined
thresholds are indicative of abnormal use for calls placed using a predetermined 800

number.
A method as claimed in claim 3, wherein the plurality of predetermined
thresholds are indicative of abnormal use for calls placed to a predetermined termination

location.
A method as claimed in claim 1, wherein the processing step comprises:

processing at least one of the predetermined attributes (54-1...54-N) to derive at
least one additional value indicative of a pattern of network use;
comparing the additional value with a predetermined threshold, the
predetermined threshold being indicative of abnormal network use; and
returning an indication that the call represents an abnormal use of the network if
the additional value exceeds the predetermined threshold.
A method as claimed in claim 1, further comprising the step of modifying, in
real time, access to the network in response to feedback from the subscriber.
A method as claimed in claim 9, wherein the modifying step comprises
automatically blocking a subsequent telephone call having predetermined attributes

specified by the subscriber.
