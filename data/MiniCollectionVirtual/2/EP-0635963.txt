<ABSTRACT>
A portable telephone set includes a main section (1) 
thereof, an IC card (2), and a battery pack (3), which are 

removably connected to each other. The battery pack (3) has an 
L-shaped rib (5) to provide a slot in which the IC card (2) is 

inserted. When the IC card (2) is inserted in the slot, a side 
surface of the IC card (2) is brought into contact with a side 

surface of the battery pack (3) to be held therein in a unified 
form. In the combined state, a hook section (6) of the battery 

pack (3) held with the IC card (2) is engaged with an engaging 
section (8) of the main section (1). When the battery pack (3) is 

pushed downward, a depressed portion (7) of the battery pack (3) 
is engaged with a lock member (9) so as to fixedly attach the 

battery pack (3) onto the main section (1). The IC card (2) is 
pushed by the battery pack (3) and the main section (1) to be 

brought into contact with a connector (4) of the main section (1) 
so as to establish a stable connection therebetween. There is 

provided a small-sized, low-cost portable telephone set 
having improved operability of IC card installation and 

removal.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a portable telephone
set, and in particular, to a portable telephone set including
a battery pack and IC card mounting section in which a
battery pack and an IC card is installed when the telephone
set is in operation.Conventionally, to expand functions and to guarantee
flexibility of the functions while retaining portability,
there have been proposed various portable and car-mount-type
telephone sets using an IC card. As well known, the IC card
has satisfactory characteristics, namely, the IC card has a
small size, a light weight, a mechanical strength,
resistibility against environmental influences, etc. In
general, the IC card is removably installed in the telephone
set for effective utilization of the characteristics. This
is also the case with the IC card adopted in the portable
telephone set and hence operability of the IC card mounting
mechanism is essential performance of the portable telephone
set.Fig. 1 is a cross-sectional view for explaining an IC
card installing mechanism of a conventional portable
telephone set
as disclosed, e.g., in the European Patent Application
EP-A-0 505 931. In Fig. 1, a main section of portable
telephone set 101 includes a section for accommodating therein
an IC card 102. With the IC card installed in the section, a
battery pack 103 is mounted on the IC card 102 in the main
section 101 to be fixedly held therein. The IC card 102 has a
connecting terminal to be linked with a connector 104 
provided in the card accommodating section of the main
section 101. The connector 104 is energized to be pushed
against the IC card side to guarantee stability of the
connection. When the battery pack 103 is removed therefrom.
the IC card 102 is moved upward by a pushing force of the
connector 104, which facilitates removal of the IC card 102
(reference is to be made to Japanese Utility-Model Laid-Open
Publication No. 5-9057).In addition, there has been proposed a configuration
in which the main section of the telephone set has an opening
to insert an IC card therein such that the opening is
surrounded by the battery pack with the IC card inserted
therein (Japanese Utility-Model Laid-Open Publication No. 1-160523).Moreover, there have been proposed, for example,
a structure in which the main section of the telephone set has a
bottom portion provided with a slit-shaped opening to insert
an IC card therein, a constitution in which the main section has
a portion including a rotable IC card accommodating section,
or a configuration including an openable

A portable telephone set comprising:

a portable telephone casing (20); and
a battery pack (3) attachable to and detachable
from the portable telephone casing (20), the battery

pack (3) including IC card holding means (5) for
holding an IC card (2), the battery pack (3) and the IC

card (2) positioned in the IC card holding means (5)
being attachable to and detachable from the portable

telephone casing (20) as a unit;

   wherein the battery pack (3) includes a mounting
side, with the mounting side being the side of the

battery pack (3) which is attachable to and detachable
from the portable telephone casing (20) 
characterised in that

the battery pack (3) has opposed lateral sides
and a plurality of first engagement means (6, 7) on

opposite ones of the lateral sides; and the IC
card holding means (5) includes an L-shaped rib forming

a slot and being disposed towards an end of the battery
pack (3) on the mounting side thereof for receiving an

IC card (2);

the IC card (2) having a connector section, the
portable telephone casing (20) having a battery pack

and IC card receiving section which includes an IC card
surface positioned to be opposite the IC card when the

battery pack (3) and IC card (2) as a unit are attached
to the portable telephone casing (20),

a plurality
of second engagement means (8, 9) engageable with the

first engagement means (6, 7) of the battery pack (3) and a first
