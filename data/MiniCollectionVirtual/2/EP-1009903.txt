<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a method and element for illuminating areas by targeted guidance of daylight, comprising an optically transparent base body through which the light shines into said area and in which a plurality of structures are provided, through which light is deviated into said area by means of total reflection. The invention is characterized in that the plurality of structures consist of at least approximately parallel slits or centres of deformation.

<CLAIMS>
Method for the production of an element for illuminating rooms,
characterized in that
 a plate-shaped base body made of a polymer is subjected to
a tensional force which is applied parallel to the surface of said plate, whereby

so-called crazes, i.e. flat wedge-shaped deformation centers having a refractive
index different from that of the base material are formed.
Method according to claim 1,
characterized in that
 during the application of the tensional force the plate surface
is additionally subjected to an impact of a solvent.
Method according to claim 2,
characterized in that
 the solvent is an organic solvent.
Method according to any one of claims 1 to 3,
characterized in that
 a subjection to tension and, if applicable, to an impact of a
solvent is performed at a raised temperature.
Method according to one of claims 1 to 4,
characterized in that
 the tensional force is applied using a bending device through
which the plate material is passed in the form of an endless material.
