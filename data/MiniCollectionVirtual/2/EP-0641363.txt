<ABSTRACT>
Novel block copolymers comprising from 20 to 95 mole % of monomer units derived from itaconic acid or a homologue thereof and from 5 to 80 mole % of monomer units derived from vinyl alcohol or a lower vinyl ester are excellent binders of divalent or polyvalent metals and are useful as potentially biodegradable builders in detergent compositions.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention is concerned with the use of polycarboxylate 
copolymers as binders of divalent and polyvalent 
metals, as builders in detergent compositions, and as film 
substrates and detergency builders for water-soluble detergent 
and wash additive sachets. Polycarboxylate polymers, especially acrylic and maleic 
polymers, are well-known ingredients of detergent compositions 
and provide various benefits. They are used, for example, as 
antiredeposition and antiincrustation agents; for detergency 
building, especially in conjunction with water-insoluble 
aluminosilicate builders; and for the structuring of 
detergent powders. Although various polycarboxylate polymers have been 
disclosed in the literature as detergent ingredients, only 
polyacrylates and acrylate/maleate copolymers have found 
widespread use in commercial detergent products. Water-soluble polymers of itaconic acid and their 
preparation are described in US 3 055 873 (Pfizer). These 
polymers are useful as antiredeposition aids in detergent 
compositions, and also have the capacity to form clear, 
extremely tough films. US 3 405 060 (Carter et al/Monsanto) discloses the use of 
water-soluble polyitaconic acid and its water-soluble salts as 
sequestering agents for metal cations.  
 The use of the water-soluble salts of itaconic acid 
homopolymers, and of copolymers of itaconic acid with maleic 
acid, acrylic acid or aconitic acid, as builders in detergent 
compositions, is disclosed in GB 1 054 755 (Procter & Gamble). EP 506 246A (RÃ¶hm & Haas), filed on 9 March 1992 and 
published on 30 September 1992, discloses the preparation of 
itaconic acid homopolymers and copolymers which are 
biodegradable and useful (inter alia) as detergent additives 
(antiredeposition aids) and scale inhibitors, and for the 
formation of clear, tough films. Low molecular weights (Mw 
<10 000, preferably <5000) are preferred. The only comonomer 
described is acrylic acid. EP 193 360A (Procter & Gamble) and US 4 725 655 (BASF) 
disclose copolymers of a monounsaturated dicarboxylic acid (eg 
maleic or itaconic acid), a monounsaturated monocarboxylic 
acid (eg acrylic or methacrylic acid), and optionally a 
non-carboxylic monounsaturated monomer, for example, vinyl 
acetate or acrylonitrile. There is no disclosure of a 
copolymer containing both itaconic acid and vinyl acetate 
units. The Procter & Gamble document discloses a terpolymer 
of acrylic acid, maleic acid and vinyl alcohol (molar 
proportions 45/45/10). JP 61 246 294A (Nippon Oils and Fats)
