Cover for the backrest of a motor vehicle seat, comprising a dimensionally 
stable moulding (9) covering the back of the backrest upholstery and 

which has at its lower end an extension (12) forwardly engaging under the 
seat (1), characterized in that the extension (12) is constructed in a 

flexible and substantially plate-like manner and is provided with several 
bending grooves (13) running substantially parallel to a rotation axis of the 

backrest (3) of the seat (1). 
Cover according to claim 1, characterized in that the extension (12) 
covers all rearwardly directed visible surfaces of the fittings and other 

functional parts of the seat structure. 
Cover according to claim 1 or 2, characterized in that the moulding (9) 
and the extension (12) are made from the same material, but having different 

bending behaviours. 
Cover according to one of the claims 1 to 3, characterized in that the 
extension (12) has a curvature, whose centre is substantially parallel to the 

rotation axis of the backrest (3). 
Cover according to claim 4, characterized in that the bending grooves 
(13) are applied in such a way that the curvature is obtained during the 

manufacture of the moulding (9). 
Cover according to claim 4, characterized in that the cover (8) is in 
multilayer form, e.g. a support material (10) and a backing (11) and the 

layers are so constructed and/or applied, that the curvature is obtained 
during the manufacture of the moulding. 
Cover according to one of the claims 1 to 6, characterized in that at 
its lower, free end, the extension (12) is suspended by means of elastic 

elements (15) on the seat structure.
