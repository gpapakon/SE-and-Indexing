<ABSTRACT>
The present invention offers a method of measuring the
activity of a tested substance which inhibits or promotes the

production of the blood coagulation factor XII in an active form.
An activation reaction of a blood coagulation factor XII is
initiated by adding a blood coagulation factor XII activator to

the animal plasma in the presence of the tested substance, then
the reaction is stopped and the blood coagulation factor XII in

an active form produced in the above reaction is quantitatively
determined.
FXIIa plays a very important role in the initiation stage in
the intrinsic blood clotting system, fibrinolysis system and

plasma kallikrein-kinin system and, accordingly, also in the measuring
method of the present invention, in which the activity of the

tested substance having the inhibiting or promoting action on the
production of FXIIa is very highly useful in screening the drugs

related to blood clotting and fibrinolysis systems and those
related to plasma kallikrein-kinin system such as, for example,

blood pressure controlling agents, antiinflammatory agents,
analgesics, antiallergic agents, etc.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method of measuring the
activity of a tested substance to the production of a blood
coagulation factor XII in an active form and, more particularly,
it relates to a method of measuring the activity of a substance
which inhibits or promotes the production of the blood coagulation
factor XII.The blood coagulation factor XII (hereinafter abbreviated as
an FXII) which is called a Hageman factor is a factor which is
activated for the first time in the chain reaction of intrinsic
blood clotting. An activated blood coagulation factor XII
(the blood coagulation factor XII in an active form; hereinafter
abbreviated as an FXIIa) activates the blood coagulation factor
XII, then a series of the reaction system of intrinsic blood
clotting as shown in (1) of Fig. 3 proceeds and, finally, an
insoluble fibrin is produced whereupon the intrinsic blood clotting
reaction is accomplished.A series of the mechanisms for dissolving the fibrin clot is
a fibrinolysis system and it has been known that FXIIa participates
in the initial phase of the fibrinolysis system. Thus, as
shown in (2) of Fig. 3, plasmin which plays a main role in the
fibrinolysis is present in plasma as an insoluble plasminogen but
FXIIa is one of the activators which activate plasminogen. The
reaction by which the fibrin clot is produced by coagulation 
of plasmin is the final stage of the fibrinolysis system.In addition, activation of FXII is an initial stage of the
plasma kallikrein-kinin system. In the plasma kallik-rein-kinin
system, it is believed that a series of enzymatic
reaction systems are involved as a result of the activation of
FXII by injury, invaded stimulation, etc. to the tissues in vivo.
Thus, as shown in (3) of Fig. 3, the activated FXIIa acts on the
plasma prekallikrein which is also present in the plasma, converts
it to a plasma kallikrein which is an enzyme in an active
form and then the plasma kallikrein acts on the high-molecular-weight
kininogen (hereinafter abbreviated as an HK) to liberate
bradykinin.EP-A-0 259 857 discloses a method for assaying a physiologically active substance
(a drug), which comprises (i) activating F-XII in animal plasma in the presence of a drug
to be tested in order to convert plasma prekallikrein into kallikrein and (ii) measuring the
amount of kallikrein produced by activated F-XII.EP-A-0 078 764 discloses a method for determining quantitatively the amount of
F-XII in human plasma, which comprises (i) adding an activator to the plasma sample in
order to activate F-XII,
