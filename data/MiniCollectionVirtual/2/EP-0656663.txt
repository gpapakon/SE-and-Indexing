<ABSTRACT>
A non-volatile memory cell disclosed herein includes 
a pair of regions (8-1,8-2) are provided in a channel region in 

contact respectively with source (3) and drain (2) to provide a 
symmetrical structure. A data erase is done by applying a 

high voltage to the source (3) to produce avalanche breakdown 
between the source (3) and the region (8-2) to inject induced hot 

carriers into the floating gate (5) and wherein the memory cell 
threshold voltage after erasure is converged to a constant 

value irrespective of the initial states, while the 

converged value may be controlled to a desired voltage by 
applying a suitable voltage to the control gate (7). Erasure 

sequence consisting in all bit erase and one verification is 
sufficient such that the erase sequence is simplified and 

erase time shortened.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to an erasing method of a non-volatile
semiconductor memory device and, more particularly, of a
flash EEPROM in which data stored in a plurality of memory
cells can be electrically erased simultaneously.As typical prior-art examples of a flash EEPROM
(Electrically Erasable and Electrically Programmable Read
Only Memory), a unit memory cell structure is shown in Fig. 
3b of the JP Patent Kokai Publication Sho 61-127179 (1986),
while the operation of the unit memory cell is described in,
for example, in Gautum Verma & Neal Mielke, "RELIABILITY
PERFORMANCES OF ETOX BASED FLASH MEMORIES", 1988 IEEE/IRPS,
pages 158 to 166.The method for programming and erasing data in a
memory array comprised of memory cells is shown for example
in VIRGIL NILES KYNETT et al, "An In-System Reprogrammable
32K × 8 (CMOS Flash Memory", Journal of Solid State Circuit
Oct., 1988 Vol. 1, 23 No. 5 pages 1157 to 1163. These
prior-art technique are now described by referring to Figs.
7 and 8.Fig. 7 shows a unit memory cell in cross-section.
The memory cell is made up of a drain diffusion layer 502
formed by a n+ diffusion layer on the surface of a p-type
semiconductor substrate 501, a source diffusion layer 503
having a double structure of an n+ diffusion layer 503-1
wrapped by an n- diffusion layer, 503-2, a floating gate 505
provided on a tunnel insulating layer 504 covering a channel
region between the source and the drain, and a control gate
507 provided thereover with intervention of an insulating
layer 506.Referring to Fig. 8, operation of the memory cell
is explained. For writing or programming data, the source
and the substrate are grounded and high voltages Vg and Vd 
(Vg>Vd) are respectively applied to the control gate and
the drain to inject electrons generated by impact ionization
near the drain into the floating gate, as shown in Fig. 8A.For erasing the data, the control gate and the
substrate are grounded and the drain is kept open. On the
other hand, a (positive) high voltage VPP is applied to the
source, as shown in Fig. 8B. As a result, electrons can be
transported from the floating gate to the source due to
tunneling effect. The n- diffusion layer 503-2 is provided
in the source in order to prevent avalanche breakdown from
being generated between the source and the substrate even if
a voltage sufficient to produce tunnel emission is applied
to the source.In an actual memory device, a number of such memory
cells are arranged in a matrix to provide a memory cell
array, as shown in Fig. 9. In this
