<ABSTRACT>
Method and system, for calibrating a vector modulator 
that does not require a network analyzer, are disclosed 

which are incorporated in a vector modulation system 

comprising a standard vector modulator circuit including 
means for shifting phase to adjust the relative phases of 

the I and Q components of the modulated RF carrier. Means 
for attenuating are included in the I and Q modulation 

system to adjust the relative amplitude of the modulation 
signals. The disclosure describes a technique wherein the 

microwave transmitter's I and Q phase difference is measured 
by measuring the power levels of selected frequencies of the RF output 

signal. The power levels are compared and a correction value is 
stored in a read-only memory to compensate for the error. 

More particularly, the error compensation is achieved by 
first determining amplitude error or unbalance by I and Q 

signal power measurement and an amplitude compensation 
signal is stored, then a power measurement is carried out 

for phase compensation and a phase compensation signal is 
stored.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to vector modulation systems,
and more particularly to vector modulation systems
including I/Q modulators and tuning techniques therefor.RF or Microwave communications using digital modulation
techniques require signal modulators which perform vector
or quadrature modulation. In vector modulation two
modulation input signals independently modulate the in-phase
(I) and quadrature (Q) components of the carrier.
For proper operation, the I and Q channels of the modulator
must be calibrated to be equal in gain, i.e., balanced, and
precisely 90Â° apart, i.e., in quadrature.One way to calibrate a vector modulator is with a network
analyzer connected to the RF carrier input and to the RF
modulated output. The network analyzer measures the
amplitude and phase of the RF modulated output resulting
from varying DC voltages applied to the I and Q modulation
inputs. From these measurements, the gain and phase
accuracy of the modulator can be determined, and
calibrated. This is an expensive and complicated technique
that is also limited in accuracy. Structure and techniques
for calibrating a vector modulator that does not require a
network analyzer, are provided by the present invention and
incorporated in a system comprising a standard vector
modulator circuit including means for shifting phase to
adjust the relative phases of the I and Q components of the
modulated RF carrier. Means for variable attenuating are
included in the I and Q modulation system to adjust the
relative amplitude of the modulation signals. The article "An Adaptive Direct Conversion Transmitter" by
D. Hilborn, S.P. Stapleton and J.K. Cavers from the
Vehicular Technology Society, 42nd VTS Conference, May 10-13th
1992 describes an adaptive direct conversion
transmitter in which a simple algorithm is used to adjust
the parameters of a quadrature modulator.According to the present invention there is provided a
vector modulation system for correcting amplitude and
phase differences in a data signal during digital encoding,
including a vector modulation system comprising:
I/Q digital encoder means for providing a digital
I component signal for the in-phase I component of a data
signal and a digital Q component signal for the quadrature
Q component of the data signal;digital-to-analog converter means for
converting the digital I and Q component signals to analog
I and Q component signals;a first vector path for the analog I component
