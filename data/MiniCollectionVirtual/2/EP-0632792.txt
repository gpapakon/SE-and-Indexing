<ABSTRACT>
A fiber-hydratable cement composition comprising a uniform dispersion of from 0.0001 to 10 volume percent interground fiber in hydratable cement powder is prepared by introducing fiber precursors and cement clinker to a grinding mill and grinding the mixture until the clinker has been reduced to a fine powder. The fiber can be steel, alkaline resistant glass, ceramic, carbon or organic polymer, and preferably are steel, polyolefin or mixtures thereof.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to fiber reinforced cementitious
compositions such as concrete, mortar and grout. In particular,
this invention relates to the preparation of an interground fiber
and cement composition which yields superior fiber reinforced
concretes, mortars and grouts.The physical properties of concretes, mortars and grouts have
been improved by including organic fibers in the mixtures. A wide
variety of organic polymer fibers have been introduced into concrete
mixtures in the form of monofilaments, fibrillated sheet materials
and fibrils. The optimal polymers are chemically inert and devoid
of groups which undergo hydrolysis in the initial wet mixtures and
final 'set' compositions. Polyolefin and steel fibers, in
particular, have proven to have superior tensile strain capacity and
stability and to improve the concretes and mortars to which they
have been added.The fibers become micromechanically bonded to the cementitious
products during the hydration and polymerization reactions, in part
from shrinkage of the cementitious components during the setting
reactions. They can provide impact, shatter and abrasion
resistance, plastic shrinkage crack control, improved post-cracking
characteristics, and prolonged fatigue life. However, in order to
provide these and other improved characteristics, it is essential
that the fibers be uniformly dispersed in the initial mixtures.Prior to this invention, fibers used in cementitious
compositions were sold as bulk, packaged fibrillated or monofilament
fibers, or fibrils. The fibers were typically added to the mixer
with the cement, sand, aggregate, other admixtures, and water. The
longer fibers tend to clump and ball, particular at higher 
concentrations, and the shearing action of the mixer and composition
components was relied upon to separate and disperse the fibers.
Because of the opacity and texture of the cementitious mixtures, no
visual monitoring of the mixing is possible. Examination of set
cementitious compositions, however, reveals that optimal unbundling
and efficient uniform dispersion of the fibers is not usually
achieved.According to Derwent Publications, AN 87-255313
and SU-A-1283232 it is kown to use superfine
basalt fibres having a specific surface area of 12000
- 14000 cm2/g as a grinding aid for cement clinker.A hydratable mixture comprising a uniform dispersion of from
0.0001 to 10 volume percent interground fiber in hydratable cement
powder is prepared by introducing fiber precursors and cement
