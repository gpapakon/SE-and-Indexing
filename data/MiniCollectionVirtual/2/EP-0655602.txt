<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention is directed to an improved autoignition 
feature specifically for air bag igniters for automobiles and 
squibs in general. The automotive industry has taken the decision to include 
safety restraint systems, such as air bags, in the driver's side of 
automobiles and is quickly applying this airbag technology to the 
passenger side as well. Part of that technology system includes a 
squib or igniter which, when signaled, ignites pyrotechnic material 
which then ignites an enhancer which energizes gas generating 
pellets. The gas released from the pellets fills an airbag with 
sufficient gas in a timely fashion to prevent serious injury to 
passengers in the front seat of an automobile in the event of a car 
accident. An igniter, as disclosed in U.S. patent 3,971,320 the 
disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference, is an 
important member in the calculus of filling an air bag. The 
igniter converts electrical signals into chemical ones. Once 
signaled the igniter promotes the forward reaction for the 
pyrotechnic material to insure that the gas filling means is 
initiated which operates to fill the air bag in the event of a car 
accident. A problem in this art is the life expectancy of the air 
bag/igniter assembly in the event there is no car accident. 
Specifically, one such problem is the ignition of the pyrotechnic 
enhancer without the corresponding ignition of the igniter itself. 
Past assemblies have shown that the pyrotechnic enhancer may be 
affected by some environmental initiator other than the igniter, 
leaving the igniter as a live pyrotechnic unit waiting to be 
initiated.  The present invention is directed to a means of completely 
initiating the pyrotechnics in an autoignition assembly in the 
event that the pyrotechnic enhancer or some other pyrotechnic 
member is first initiated instead of the igniter. As those skilled 
in this art may be quick to recognize, there will be far more 
unignited igniters than ignited ones since, happily, there are far 
fewer cars involved in accidents than those that are. Therefore, 
as a safety measure, the present invention provides a means to 
assure that the pyrotechnics and/or propellants of the entire air 
bag assembly ignite, if any portion of the assembly is initiated. The present invention is found to be very useful for the 
purposes of air bag safety restraint systems and for squib 
assemblies, in general. The Figure is an autoignition assembly showing the positions 
of the various pyrotechnics. An autoignition
