<ABSTRACT>
A trackbound vehicle, in particular for urban passenger transport, consists essentially of at least one waggon body (1) and two bogeys (2), at least one bogey (2) being electrically driven using a diesel engine (3), arranged at least on the waggon side, and a generator (4). In order to be able to obtain a floor with little clearance above the top edge of the rail, the diesel engine (3) and the generator (4) are accommodated in the roof (1') of the waggon body (1).

<CLAIMS>
A rail-borne vehicle, in particular for local passenger transport, consisting of at least one 
carriage body (1) and two running gears (2), at least one running gear (2) being 

electrically driven by a driving engine arranged in the roof (1') of the carriage body (1) 
and a generator (4) likewise housed in the roof (1'), characterised in that the driving 

engine in the form of a diesel engine (3) and the generator (4) are resiliently mounted on 
a supporting structure (8) spring-supported relative to longitudinal members (9) of the 

roof (1'). 
A rail-borne vehicle in accordance with Claim 1, characterised in that the carriage body 
(1) is a constituent part of a two-part or multi-part motor-coach train. 
A rail-borne vehicle in accordance with Claim 2, characterised in that the carriage body 
(1) is considerably shorter than the other or the rest of the carriage parts (1a, 1b) of the 

motor-coach train. 
A rail-borne vehicle in accordance with Claim 2 or 3, characterised in that the carriage 
body (1) is arranged between two outer carriage parts (1a, 1b). 
A rail-borne vehicle in accordance with any one of Claims 2 to 4, characterised in that 
the running gears (2) located at the ends of the motor-coach train are driven. 
A rail-borne vehicle in accordance with any one of Claims 1 to 5, characterised in that 
components forming part of the electrical equipment ― such as rectifier (5), traction 

inverter (5'), braking resistors (6) and heating apparatus (7) ― are likewise arranged in the 
roof (1') of the carriage body (1) or within that roof region of another carriage part (1a, 

1b) which is adjacent to the carriage body (1). 
A rail-borne vehicle in accordance with any one of Claims 1 to 6, characterised in that 
the carriage body (1) or another carriage part (1a, 1b) has at least one current collector 

(10), a diesel-electric mode of driving or powering through a contact line (12) being 
selectable by means of an electric switch (11).
