<ABSTRACT>
An escape device (1) for aircrafts having a pair of gas 
bags (3) and a slide member (4) joined to the gas bags. The escape 

device provides a high resistance to radiation heat and 
reliable bonding between the sheet members. The sheet 

member forming the gas bags and the slide member includes a 
substrate of fabric and covering layers of thermosetting 

elastomer containing a flame retardant. The sheet members 
forming the gas bags are bonded together before the 

covering layer of one of the sheet members hardens 
completely. A protective layer is provided on the outer 

surface of the joint portion between the sheet members to 
reflect radiation heat.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a device installed on an 
aircraft for use as an escape slide or a life-saving raft 
in case of emergency such as emergency landing. Unexamined Japanese Patent Publication 59-152851 
discloses an escape device for an aircraft of this type. 
It is normally stored in an aircraft in a folded state. In 
case of emergency, it is inflated by blowing gas thereinto 
to form a slide. As shown in present Fig. 1, this device comprises an opposed 
pair of gas bags 1 formed of flexible sheets into a 
cylindrical shape, and a sheet member provided between and 
secured to the gas bags 1. Its top surface serves as a 
slide surface 2. By inflating the gas bags by blowing gas 
thereinto, this device can be used as a slide. In case the 
aircraft has landed on the sea, this device can be used as 
a life raft by detaching it from the aircraft because the 
gas bags 1 have buoyancy. When using the device as a slide, the gas bags 1 
serve to keep the shape of the slide. Thus, they have to 
have a sufficient rigidity. If the device is used as a 
life raft, the bags serve as floats for keeping the raft 
afloat on the water. It is therefore essential that the 
joint portions of the sheets forming the gas bags stably  
 
exhibit high bond strength and air-tightness. If a fire breaks out in an emergency situation, the 
escape device will be exposed to very high radiation heat. 
The joint portions of the sheets forming the gas bags are 
thus required to maintain high bond strength even under 
high-temperature conditions. For this purpose, as shown in present Fig. 10, Unexamined 
Japanese Patent Publication 59-152851 proposes to form the 
gas bags and the slide surface from sheet members 41 having 
covering layers 42, 43 made of a thermoplastic polymer. 
The sheet members 41 are bonded together through a heat-resistant 
adhesive. On the outer side of the bonded 
portion is applied a protective layer 44 made of a 
thermoplastic polymer containing metallic particles to 
reflect the radiation heat and minimize the temperature 
rise at the joint portion. Such a conventional escape device has the following 
problems. 
(1) If exposed to radiation heat, the covering layers 42, 
43 of the sheet member 41 will be heated and soften, thus 
lowering the strength of the sheet. If exposed to high 
radiation heat, the thermoplastic polymer forming the sheet 
members may melt and flow. Since the gas pressure in the 
gas bags rises when heated, the thermoplastic polymer of 
the covering layer may be pushed outwards by the
