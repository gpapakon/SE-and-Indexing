<ABSTRACT>
In a data processing apparatus and data processing method,
each output system is controlled according to the contents of copy

restriction based on control data so as to output digital data via
one output system which is specified out of plural output systems.

Therefore, when the control data show the copy restriction,
digital data is previously prevented from being output via the

plural output systems. As a result, a data processing apparatus
and data processing method capable of conducting data control

without fail are realized.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a data processing apparatus
and data processing method, and suitably applied to such as an IRD
(integrated receiver decoder) for the DVB (digital video
broadcast).Heretofore, in this type of digital broadcasting system,
after the video data and audio data of plural channels are
compression-coded by using the MPEG2 (moving picture experts group
phase 2), these data are packetized per the predetermined unit
(such as 184 [byte]) (hereinafter, the resultant packets are
referred to as TS (transport stream) packets) and multiplexed, to
form a transport stream which is then transmitted via terrestrial
wave, satellite wave or cable as the digital broadcasting signal.In such digital broadcasting system, a receiving apparatus
extracts TS packets corresponding to a desired channel from among
the TS packets contained in the transport stream received as a
digital broadcasting signal, and decodes them to the video data
and audio data in the original signal format according to the
reverse procedure to the compression processing. In recent years, such a receiving apparatus has plural
output terminals for digital signals as output terminals for
external connection (hereinafter referred to as digital output
terminal). This allows audio data obtained by the aforementioned
decoding, after being converted into a predetermined format, to be
output to an external apparatus via an optical digital audio
output terminal of IEC (International Electro-Technical Committee)
958 format, or to be output to an external apparatus via a high-speed
serial interface called IEE (institute of electrical and
electronics engineers) 1394, or allows the transport stream before
decoding itself to be output to an external apparatus.Since degradation in image quality and sound quality does
not occur in such digitalized video data and audio data, a digital
recording apparatus can dub data unlimited number of times without
degradation in quality.Therefore, in general, by transmitting video data and audio
data after adding predetermined copy control data (CCI: copy
control information) at the transmitting end, copy is restricted
based on the copy control data at the digital receiving end, and
thus, unlawful dubbing infringing the copyright can be prevented.According to the SCMS (serial copy management system)
adopted in the IEC 958, this copy control data has three types of
information: "never copy", "copy once", and "copy free". More
specifically, "never copy" represents that copy is not allowed,
"copy once"
