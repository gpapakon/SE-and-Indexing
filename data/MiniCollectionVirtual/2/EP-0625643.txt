<ABSTRACT>
The invention proposes an expansion dowel (1) which has a longitudinally divided expansion region (11). A shank part (5), which forms one half of the expansion region (11), is connected to a shank sleeve (2), extending towards the dowel opening (8), via dovetail-shaped connecting elements or other connecting elements in a connection region (19). The other shank part (4) of the expansion region (11) may be integrally connected to the shank sleeve (2).

<CLAIMS>
An expansible plug (1) with a closed shank section in the form of a
shank sleeve (2), which has a screw channel and continues as a

longitudinally divided expansible shank (3), the two shank-halves
(4, 5)of which have staggered expansible elements (14, 15) that

interlock to form a closed expansion region (11), the expansible
elements (14, 15) being offset with respect to one another and

having bores (17, 18) arranged eccentrically with respect to the
centre line (16) of the expansible plug (1), which bores overlap in

such a way that the overlapping region forms a constricted screw
channel, characterized in that the expansion region (11) tapers

conically towards the plug tip (6) and that the two shank-halves (4,
5) are fixedly joined to the shank sleeve (2), one shank-half (4)

being integrally joined to the shank sleeve (2) and the other shank-half
(5) being joined by means of an interlocking joint with the shank

sleeve (2).
An expansible plug according to claim 1, characterized in that the
interlocking joint is a dovetail joint (21) or other joint proof against

rotation, bending and tension.
An expansible plug according to claim 1 or 2, characterized in that
from the shank sleeve (2) and from the two shank-halves (4, 5)

forming the expansion region (11) there projects outwardly at least
one respective longitudinal rib (23-25) as an anti-rotation element.
An expansible plug according to claim 3,
characterized in that the longitudinal ribs (23-25) are

arranged offset in respect of their longitudinal
position and in respect of their angular position. 
An expansible plug according to one of the preceding claims,
characterized in that a longitudinal rib (24) is arranged at the

transition region (26) between the shank sleeve (2) and one shank-half
(4).
An expansible plug according to one of the preceding claims,
characterized in that an impact barrier (12), in the form of an

annular collar or similar construction, for an inserted fixing screw (9)
projects from the shank sleeve (2).
An expansible plug according to one of the preceding claims,
characterized in that a front expansible portion (27) is formed at the

plug tip (6), the expansion direction of which is oriented offset
through 90Â° with respect to the expansion direction of the

expansion region (11) defined by the expansible elements (14, 15).
An expansible plug according to one of the preceding claims,
characterized in that the expansible plug (1) is manufactured from

plastics material as an opened-out part in a single injection
moulding operation, and the two shank-halves (4, 5) are joined at

the plug tip (6) by means of an injection-moulded web (7).
