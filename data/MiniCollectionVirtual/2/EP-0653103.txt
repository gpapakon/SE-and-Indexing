<ABSTRACT>
A raster scan lithography system is modified so that the duration of illumination (dose modulation) for particular pixels is varied to lie between the full on and full off normally used. For instance, three levels of pixel intensity are provided, 100 %, 70 % and 30 % (in addition to off which is 0 %). The 30 % and 70 % pixels are used along the edge of a feature so as to locate the edge (52, 54) when written in between the lines of the cartesian raster scan grid. Thus the edges of the feature are moved off the grid, without the need for multiple passes. This pixel dose modulation uses three preset delay lines (30) determining dwell times for each pixel on a pixel-by-pixel basis, as defined by a two (or more) bit deep memory file associated with the pattern to be written. Additionally, the pixel center locations are directly moved off the grid by deflecting the beam as it scans certain pixels located along feature edges. The amount of deflection is controllably variable to achieve various edge locations. This deflection is used by itself or in combination with dose modulation, and is implemented by an electrostatic deflector in the beam lens for an E-beam system.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to raster scan lithography as
used for producing masks and wafers for integrated circuit
fabrication, and more specifically to raster scan electron
beam systems.It is well known to use particle (electron or ion) or
light beam exposure systems for the manufacture of
microminiature electronic devices (integrated circuits).
Often these systems use raster scan beam lithography
methods. Such lithographic employing a controllable
electron beam, sometimes called E-beam machines, for
fabrication of integrated circuits are well known; one
such system is described in U.S. Patent No. 3,900,737 to
Collier et al. and an other in U.S. Patent No. 3,801,792
to Lin.In these machines a medium of resist (or
photosensitive) material upon which the electron beam is
to perform its writing operation is provided overlying a
substrate which is to become a mask for imaging a wafer or
which is the wafer itself (direct writing). The medium
with its underlying substrate is positioned on a motordriven
stage which is moved continuously in synchronism as
the beam is scanned in a raster fashion (a raster scan)
and in a direction perpendicular to the stage motion. In
practice, the diameter of the round electron beam spot,
also called a "Gaussian spot" or "pixel", focussed on the 
resist layer, is of the order of (but not necessarily
equal to) the writing address dimension (or address unit)
of the cartesian grid on which it is written. Adjacent
rows of pixels in the stage travel direction define the
width of a "feature" and a length of the feature is formed
by a number of pixels in the raster scan direction. The
feature is for instance an element of the integrated
circuit such as a conductive interconnect or a portion of
a transistor. In practice, adjacent "on" pixels in the
same raster scan are not separately scanned; instead the
beam is kept on until an "off" pixel is encountered. For
the purposes of this disclosure, descriptions are given in
terms of the normal full pixelization representation. The
turning on and off of the beam is achieved by a beam
blanker which is a well known portion of an E-beam
machine, one example of which is shown in U.S. Patent No.
5,276,330, patent application serial no. 07/706,612, filed
May 29, 1991, entitled 'High Accuracy Beam Blanker"
incorporated by reference herein, invented by Mark A.
Gesley. The pattern on the resist defined by the beam
scan and by the stage movement is determined by the system
control equipment which includes certain computer software
programs.Several
