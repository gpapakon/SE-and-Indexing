<ABSTRACT>
A single-lever mixing valve with a stationary control disc (15) (fixed disc) and with a second control disc (18) (regulating disc) which rests on the fixed disc, can be rotated and displaced relative to the latter and can be made up of a plate and a guiding part (36) and contains a water deflection channel; with an adjusting shaft (24) which can be rotated about an axis of rotation together with a neck part (20) and is pivotable in the latter about a pivoting axis perpendicular to the axis of rotation by means of a pivoting journal and, at its lower end, has a headpiece (27) for the translational displacement and rotation of the regulating disc, the rear side of which is assigned at least one recess for the engagement of the headpiece. The valve is characterised in that the recess on the rear side of the regulating disc is designed as a cross-shaped groove (34) with at least four arms, in that the headpiece of the adjusting shaft has a complementary shape, being of essentially cross-shaped design in cross-section, and in that at least one arm of the cross, extending parallel to the pivoting axis, accommodates an essentially roller-like shoulder of the headpiece, while a crosspiece formed by wings of the headpiece projects in a manner which allows a sliding and pivoting motion into the at least two further arms, which cross the first arm of the cross.

Single-lever mixing valve (10) having a stationary 
control disk (15) (hereinafter referred to as fixed 

disk), which has a through-opening (16) for cold water, a 
through-opening (16) for hot water and a through-opening 

(17) for mixed water; having a second control disk (18) 
(hereinafter referred to as regulating disk) resting on 

the fixed disk and twistable and displaceable relative to 
said fixed disk, which second control disk may comprise a 

plate and a guide part (36) and contains a water-reversing 
channel (19) which, depending on the relative 

position of the two control disks, may be brought to 
overlap the through-openings of the fixed disk to a 

differing extent; having an adjusting shaft (24), which 
is rotatable jointly with a neck part (20) about an axis 

of rotation (22) and by means of a swivelling journal 
(23) may swivel in said neck part about a swivelling axis 

at right angles to the axis of rotation and has at its 
bottom end a head piece (27) for the translational 

displacement and twisting of the regulating disk, with 
the rear side of which at least one recess for the 

application of the head piece is associated,
characterized in
 that the recess at the rear side of the 
regulating disk (18) takes the form of a cross-shaped 

groove (34) having at least four groove branches (35, 
36), that the head piece (27) of the adjusting shaft (24) 

is designed so as to be of a substantially complementary 
cross shape in cross section, and that at least one 

groove branch (35) extending parallel to the swivelling 
axis (23) receives a substantially cylindrical projection 

(28) of the head piece (27), while a sword formed by 
wings (33) of the head piece (27) engages in a 

sliding/pivotal manner in the at least two further groove 
branches (37) which cross the first groove branch (35).  

 
Single-lever mixing valve according to claim 1,
 
characterized in that the head piece (27) of the 

adjusting shaft (24) at least at parts of its cross-shaped 
cross section has a slight oversize compared to 

the cross-shaped groove (34) so that its cylindrical 
projection (28) and/or the sword (33) are held and/or 

guided therein with an at least slight clamping and/or 
frictional lock. 
Single-lever mixing valve according to claim 1,
 
characterized by a single cross configuration of the 

coupling region between the head piece (27) of the 
adjusting shaft (24) and the regulating disk (18), e.g. 

in the form of an X. 
Single-lever mixing valve according to claim 1 or 2,
 
characterized by an at least partially double cross 

configuration of the coupling region between the head 
piece (27) of the adjusting shaft (24) and the regulating 

disk (18), e.g. in the form of an H. 
Single-lever mixing valve according to claim 1,
 
characterized in that the adjusting shaft (24) including 

its head piece (27) comprises an integral plastic 
injection-moulded body.
