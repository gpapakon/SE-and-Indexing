<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a collapsible box-shaped 
container provided with a bottom and with two pairs of 

opposed upright side walls, wherein a first pair of side 
walls are each at both ends provided with a lengthening (7) 

flap which is folded square and which is fastened to the 
inner surface of an adjacent side wall, and wherein in 

said adjacent side wall from both corner points a diagonal 
folding line is provided. 
According to the invention is each lengthening flap (7) 
provided with a connection flap (10) which is folded on the 

lengthening flap (7) and has the same length as the 
lengthening flap (7), and with a fastening flap (12) which is 

folded at an angle of 90° with respect to the lengthening 
flap and is glued on the side wall (3) provided with said 

lengthening flap (7), and each lengthening flap (19) adjacent the 
folding line (22) between lengthening flap and connection flap 

has been heightened over a portion of its length in the 
direction of the bottom, in such a way, that a single slip (56) 

lip is formed, wherein said folding line (22) over a portion of 
the height of the flaps is replaced by a cut (57), and wherein 

the height of the single slip lip (56) is greater than the 
distance between the bottom edge (42b) of the lengthening flap 

and the folding line (41) between bottom (37) and side wall (39).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a collapsible box-shaped
container provided with a bottom and two pairs of opposed
upright side walls which are folded approximately square to
the bottom, wherein the two opposed side walls of a first
pair are each at both ends provided with a lengthening flap
which is folded approximately square to the side wall, said
lengthening flap being fastened with a part of its outer
surface to a corresponding part of the inner surface of an
adjacent side wall of the other pair, and wherein in said
adjacent side wall each time from both bottom corner points
a first diagonal folding line is provided extending
upwardly at an acute angle, in such a way, that the portion
of said other side wall which is fastened on the
lengthening flap, is situated at the side of the first
diagonal folding line turned a way from the bottom.Such a collapsible box-shaped container is known from
EP-A-0 394 549. In this known container a first pair of
upright side walls is provided with four flaps which form a
rectangular tubular support which is to be unfolded and
collapsed.The invention aims at the realization of an alternative to
this known collapsible box-shaped container.This purpose is attained in that according to the invention
each lengthening flap is provided with a connection flap
which is double-folded on the lengthening flap and has
substantially the same length as the lengthening flap, and
with a fastening flap which is folded at an angle of
approximately 90° with respect to the lengthening flap and
is glued onto the side wall of the first pair provided with
the lengthening flap. The present invention provides a
container comprising a connection flap which is double-folded 
on the lengthening flap and a fastening flap which
is glued to the side wall. In contrast hereto, in the known
container the third flap from a side wall of the first pair
cannot be glued to another part of the container since the
rectangular tubular support has to be unfoldable and
collapsible.It is known per se from US-A-4,056,223 to glue a flap to
the side wall of a container, however, the container as
described in US-A-4,056,223 not being collapsible after it
has been erected or unfolded and therefore being of a
different type than the one to which the present invention
relates.With a preferred embodiment of the collapsible box-shaped
container according to the invention each lengthening flap
and connection flap adjacent to the folding line
therebetween have been widened over a portion of the length
of the flaps in the
