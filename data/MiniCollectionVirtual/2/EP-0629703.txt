<ABSTRACT>
A human Fc receptor-specific monoclonal antibody 
is disclosed together with its mode of preparation. 

Binding of the antibody to Fc receptor is not blocked 
by human immunoglobulin G. The antibody binds to 

the high affinity Fc receptor for IgG on human monocytes 
at a receptor binding site distinct from the ligand 

binding site for Fc. 
A bifunctional antibody or a heteroantibody 
has an antigen binding region derived from an anti-Fc 

receptor antibody and an antigen binding region specific 
for a target epitope or cell; such antibody may target 

a macrophage when it is bound to surface Fc receptors 
of the macrophage. 
A target-specific effector cell expresses receptor 
for the Fg portion of IgG, has one antigen binding 

region derived from an anti-Fc receptor antibody 
and another specific for a target cell, and the aforesaid 

bifunctional or hetero-antibody is bound to the Fc 
receptor of the effector cell; such effector cell 

can be used in the therapy of cancers, allergies, 
infectious and autoimmune diseases, and in immunoassays.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to monoclonal antibodies 
to Fc receptors for immunoglobulin G on human 
mononuclear phagocytes; bifunctional antibodies; target 
specific effector cells; targeted macrophages; and 
immunoassays. Several types of effector cells have surface 
receptors that bind the Fc portion of immunoglobulin 
(IgG). When such cells (monocytes, granulocytes, K 
cells, etc.) encounter target cells that have been 
opsonized with IgG antibodies, they form conjugates 
with the target cells. Subsequently, the effector 
cells either lyse or phagocytose the target cells, 
depending upon the effector cell type, the target 
cell type and the specific Fc receptor type involved. Two distinct classes of IgG Fc receptors (FcR) 
have been identified on human monocytes and on the 
human monocytic cell line U937. Looney, R.J., etal., 
(1986) J. Immunol. 136:1641-1647. One is a 
72kDa sialoglycoprotein (p72) with high affinity 
( 
Ka=10⁸-10⁹ M-1  
) for monomeric human IgG1 and IgG3  
 
and for murine subclasses IgG2a and IgG3. 
Alexander, M.D., etal. (1978) Immunol. 35:115-123; 
Anderson, C.L. and Abraham, G.N. (1980) J. Immunol. 
125:2735-2741; Lubeck, M.D. etal. (1985) J. Immuno. 
135: 1299-1304. The other receptor is a 40kDa 
molecule (p40) which shows relatively low affinity 
for monomeric IgG. Looney, etal., supra; Jones, 
D.H., etal. (1985) J. Immunol. 135:33483353. P40 
has been defined by its ability both to form 
rosettes with erythrocytes coated with murine IgG1 
and to bind aggregated murine IgG2b at low ionic 
strength. In addition, a monoclonal antibody (IV3) 
has been prepared which binds to the 40kDa receptor 
and inhibits ligand binding. See Looney, R.J., etal., 
supra. This receptor is present not only on 
mononuclear phagocytes but on human platelets, 
neutrophils and eosinophils. Rosenfeld, S.I., etal. 
(1985) J. Clin. Invest. 76:2317-2322. These two Fc receptors on human monocytes have 
been shown to mediate anti-T3-induced human T cell 
mitogenesis by distinct subclasses of murine IgG. 
The 72kDa FcR mediates murine IgG2a anti-T3-induced 
stimulation whereas the 40kDa FcR mediates murine 
IgG1 anti-T3-induced T cell mitogenesis. See Looney 
etal., supra. Based upon their distinctive affinities 
for murine IgG subclasses, p72 and p40 are 
thought to be the human homologues of murine macrophage 
FcRI and FcRII specific for murine IgG2a and 
IgG2b/1, respectively. Although not present on 
monocytes or U937 cells, a third class of IgG FcRs  
 
has been described on human neutrophils and
