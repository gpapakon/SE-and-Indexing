<ABSTRACT>
The electrode (1) in its entirety forming a cold cathode for a gas discharge tube (2), includes a substrate (support) (3) made of ferrous sheet metal, covered with an active layer (4) on its internal face (3a). The substrate (3) is inserted into a tubular ceramic sheath (5), which extends beyond this substrate on the discharge side. The active layer (4) consists of stoved alkaline-earth metal (barium and/or calcium) titanate containing a reducing element such as silicon, zirconium and aluminium in a ratio of 10

 to 10

 moles of reducing element per mole of titanate. During stoving of the layer (4) at a temperature of between 750@ and 1000@C, it is assumed that the reduction products of the titanate form dopants for lowering and regulating the output potential.

An electrode (1) for a gas discharge tube (2) forming a cold 
emission cathode and comprising, on a metallic support (3), an active 

layer (4) formed for the major part by compounds of alkaline-earth metals, 
characterised in that said compounds of alkaline-earth metals are 

titanates containing an effective amount of a reducing element. 
An electrode according to claim 1 characterised in that the 
reducing element is selected from silicon, zirconium and aluminium and 

mixtures thereof. 
An electrode according to one of claim 1 and 2 characterised 
in that the effective amount of reducing element is between 10⁻⁵ and 10⁻⁹ 

mole of reducing element per mole of titanate, preferably between 10⁻⁶ and 
10⁻⁸. 
An electrode according to any one of claims 1 to 3 
characterised in that the alkaline-earth metals combined in the titanates 

are barium and calcium, alone or in association. 
An electrode according to any one of claims 1 to 4 
characterised in that the metallic support is a cylinder (3) of ferrous 

metal sheet which is open at the two ends with its axis extending in the 
general direction of discharge, the active layer (4) being fixed on the 

inside surface (3a) of the cylinder (3). 
An electrode according to claim 5 characterised in that, 
around the support cylinder (3), it comprises a tubular sheath (5) of 

ceramic which extends beyond the support (3) at least at its end towards 
the discharge.
