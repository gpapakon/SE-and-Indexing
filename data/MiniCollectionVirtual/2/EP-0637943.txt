<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to
an apparatus
for the selective destruction of the endometrium, an
alternative to hysterectomy for treating uterine bleeding.Destruction of the inner lining of body organs
provides an alternative to removal of the body organs for
treating diseases and abnormal conditions. Techniques
applied to this procedure have included destructive
treatment of the inner linings with chemicals and with
various forms of thermal energy such as radiofrequency and
microwave heating, cryotherapy, laser and electrosurgery.
Radiofrequency and microwave energies have also been
applied directly to the linings to generate heat in situ.
However, the procedures developed to date involve manual
application of a small treatment tool to successive areas
of the lining. This is an expensive operating room
procedure, limiting its availability only to most severe
conditions of amenorrhea, for example.US-A-4,979,948 describes thermal ablation of
the mucosal layer of a gallbladder by resistive heating
with an RF balloon electrode. Electric current is
delivered from the balloon from a conductive expansion
liquid filling the balloon. In contrast to the conductive
balloon electrodes of this invention, this monopolar device
has power loss in the conductive fluid and cannot be
adapted to provide multiple electrodes, each with
individual power control and/or a temperature sensor.Balloon catheters supplied with a heated fluid have 
been used for thermal ablation of hollow body organs, as
described in US-A-5,045,056. Application of microwave
and high frequency RF energy to body areas to destroy
body tissue, using single electrodes enclosed in
expanded balloons have been described in US-A-4,662,383
and 4,676,258, for example. US-A-5188122 discloses the
use of r.f. excitation of an endometrial lining so as to
raise it to a temperature of 46째 to 55째C.It is an object of this invention to provide an apparatus
for endometrial ablation which is safe, rapid
and can be carried out without maintaining visual
contact with the endometrial lining being ablated.It is another object of this invention to
provide an apparatus for endometrial
ablation which, for some conditions, can be carried out
in a doctor's office on an out-patient basis, without
requiring the use of an operating room.In summary, the apparatus of this invention for
endometrial ablation has a power source providing RF
current having a frequency of at least about 250 kHz,
preferably from 250 kHz to 100 MHZ, from an expandable
electrode means which is expanded to bring it
