<CLAIMS>
An arrangement for the supply of cooling air to a turbine 
housing, especially that of an aircraft gas turbine, 

comprising at least two cooling air conduits (1, 2) 
branching from a compressor stage, of which one (first 

cooling air conduit 1) opens into the jacket cavity (3) of 
the turbine housing and the second (second cooling air 

conduit 2) penetrates through the jacket cavity (3) and 
opens into a bearing casing (4) for the turbine bearings,
 
characterised in that the second cooling air conduit (2) 

has at least one air flow opening (5) in the jacket cavity 
(3). 
An arrangement according to claim 1,
 
characterised in that the second cooling air conduit (2) 

penetrating through the jacket cavity (3) is substantially 
in the form of a continuous pipe, with its pipe wall in the 

region of the jacket cavity (3) being provided with a 
plurality of holes acting as air flow openings (5). 
An arrangement according to either claim 1 or 2,
 
characterised by a total of four cooling air conduits 

distributed over the circumference of the turbine housing, 
two of which end in the jacket cavity (3) substantially 

opposite each other, while two further conduits open into 
the bearing casing (4) and similarly lie substantially 

opposite each other and are provided with air flow openings 
(5) in the region of the jacket cavity.
