to formula I:


(MgO)
n
Zn(OOCR
1
)
2

in which

R
1
is a linear or branched alkyl, alkenyl, hydroxyalkenyl or hydroxyalkyl
group containing 7 to 21 carbon atoms or a ketoalkyl group containing

11 to 21 carbon atoms and
n
is a number of 0.1 to 2.5,

produced in a melt-phase reaction, magnesium or magnesium hydroxide
being added to a melt containing zinc soaps corresponding to the formula Zn

(OOCR
1
)
2
, where R
1
 is as already defined, in quantities of 0.1 to 2.5 moles
per mole of zinc soap.
Basic magnesium/zinc mixed soaps as claimed in claim 1, characterized
in that n in formula (I) is a number of 1 to 2.
A process for the production of basic magnesium/zinc mixed soaps
with a composition corresponding to formula I:


(MgO)
n
Zn(OOCR
1
)
2

in which R
1
 is a linear or branched alkyl, alkenyl, hydroxyalkenyl or hydroxyalkyl
group containing 7 to 21 carbon atoms or a ketoalkyl group containing

11 to 21 carbon atoms and n is a number of 0.1 to 2.5, characterized in that
magnesium oxide or magnesium hydroxide is added to a melt containing zinc

soaps corresponding to the formula Zn (OOCR
1
)
2
, where R
1
 is as already
defined, in quantities of 0.1 to 2.5 moles per mole of zinc soap.
A process as claimed in claim 3, characterized in that 1 to 2 moles of 
magnesium oxide or magnesium hydroxide are added per mole of zinc soap.
A process as claimed in claim 3 or 4, characterized in that magnesium
oxide is added.
A process as claimed in any of claims 3 to 5, characterized in that the
reaction mixture is heated to temperatures of 100 to 180Â°C.
A process as claimed in any of claims 3 to 6, characterized in that
acids are additionally added in a quantity of 0.001 to 0.1 % by weight, based

on the reaction mixture.
The use of the basic magnesium/zinc mixed soaps with a composition
corresponding to formula (I) claimed in claim 1 or 3 as stabilizers for halogen-containing

thermoplastics.
