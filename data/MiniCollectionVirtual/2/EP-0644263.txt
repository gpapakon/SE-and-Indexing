<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a recombinant Δ9
desaturase capable of converting stearic acid, a saturated
fatty acid, that is linked to glycerolipid to oleic acid,
an unsaturated fatty acid, and to an isolated gene encoding
the same.The Δ9 desaturase of cyanobacterium is an enzyme
converting stearic acid linking to glycerolipid to oleic
acid, and converting palmitic acid linking to C-1 of
glycerol to palmitoleic acid.In WO 91 13972 Δ-9 desaturase is described belonging to
enzymes which are known as stearoyl CoA desaturase in
cytoplasm of animals and as stearoyl ACP (acyl-carrier
protein) desaturase in chloroplast of plants. Accordingly,
this Δ-9 desaturase has an activity to convert stearoyl-ACP.
The fatty acid as a substrate is in this case not linked to
the cell membrane. This enzyme cannot change the fatty acid
composition of plant/animal itself or improve the
characteristics thereof such as temperature tolerance.In EP 550 162 a method for the alteration of a synthesis of
fatty acids and the corresponding compositions of
triacylglycerols in plants is provided. In particular a
chimeric expression cassette is described which comprises a
cDNA clone coding for a fatty acid CoA desaturase probably
linked to regulatory sequences which cause the expression of
the cDNA clone in plant cells.Wada et al., describe a method for the enhancement of chilling
tolerance of a cyanobacterium by genetic manipulation of fatty
acid desaturation. The cloning of a gene for the plant-type
desaturation (termed desA) is described. The introduction of
this gene from a chilling-resistant cyanobacterium into a
chilling-sensitive cynobacterium increases the tolerance of
the recipient to low temperature (Plant Physiology, Vol. 92,
1990, pages 1062-1069).However, neither Wada et al., nor EP 550 162 describe an
enzyme which is characterized by its property of introducing a
double bond at Δ-9 into stearic acid, a saturated fatty acid
that is linked to glycerolipid.In the cyanobacterium, the desaturation process of
fatty acids has been shown to be initiated through the
induction of the double bond into a carbon chain at Δ9
position, followed by Δ12 and then Δ6 or Δ15. The Δ9
desaturase is an important enzyme which is responsible for
the first step of a series of desaturation reactions, and
is associated with the reaction of introducing the double
bond into a carbon chain of stearic acid or palmitic acid
at Δ9, which are linked to glycerolipid. This reaction
requires reducing power, which depends on ferredoxin and
NADPH.  On the
