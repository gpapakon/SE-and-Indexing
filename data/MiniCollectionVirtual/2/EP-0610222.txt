<DESCRIPTION>
The field of the invention relates generally
to the control of operational modes of combustion
engines.. More particularly, the invention relates to
control of an advanced concept engine (ACE) using
flexible valve and injection events on a per cylinder
basis.Control of internal combustion engines has
received substantial attention in the past several
decades. Compression and spark ignition engine
designs have attempted to achieve increased
flexibility of engine operation. A plethora of
designs and patents have been directed to independent
intake and exhaust valve actuation and electronic fuel
injection. Many of these are directed to computers
and feedback systems for controlling engine timing.
Systems using independent valve actuation and
electronic fuel injection have been conceived to
perform engine operational modes not attainable by
cam-based engines. However, the embodiments of the
instant invention use fully flexible valve and
injection events to achieve mixed mode engine
operation by varying the order of events on a per
cylinder basis.The above systems that use independent valve
actuation and electronic fuel injection employ several 
methods for valve and injector actuation.
Electronically or computer controlled solenoids,
electromagnetic transducers and piezoelectric stacks
are used for direct actuation. Alternatively,
solenoids, transducers and/or stacks are used to
control hydraulic valves which in turn actuate
cylinder valves and injectors. The opening and
closing of valves and injectors in camless systems is
typically controlled as a function of some engine
parameter such as speed or angular position of the
crankshaft.One example of a dual exhaust valve
actuation system is disclosed in GB 2213873A. Two
electronically controlled electromagnetic valves are
used to switch hydraulic pressure, which in turn acts
against the valve springs for counter biasing of the
valves. GB 2213873A discloses early exhaust valve
opening in order to increase the energy supplied to
the turbocharger and thereby reduce turbo lag. A
common technique for engine braking is also discussed
in GB 2213873A. The exhaust valves are opened at top
dead center to prevent energy recovery during the
downward stroke of the engine. Moreover, operation of
a four stroke engine in two stroke mode is believed to
enhance engine braking.Independent opening and closing of intake
and exhaust valves is disclosed in U.S. Pat. No.

actuation embodiments. One embodiment describes a
pair of rotary

A system for controlling a plurality of
operational modes of an engine (102), including intake

valve and exhaust valve and fuel injection events, in
which the engine (102) comprises a plurality of

cylinders (104) having an intake valve (220) and an
exhaust valve (222), an injector (224), a chamber and

mode of each of the cylinders (104) individually and
independently of each other cylinder,

   said operational mode of each cylinder requiring
at least one of an opening and closing event of the intake

valve (220) and/or exhaust valve (222) during each engine
