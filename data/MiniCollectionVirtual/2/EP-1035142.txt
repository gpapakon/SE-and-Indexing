<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to copolymer materials which are useful as ophthalmic
devices, such as contact lenses, keratoprostheses, and corneal rings or inlays, and a
process for making such copolymer materials. In particular, this invention relates to
intraocular foldable lenses formed from acrylic copolymer materials.With the recent advances in small-incision cataract surgery, increased
emphasis has been placed on developing soft, foldable materials suitable for use in
artificial lenses. In general, these materials fall into one of three categories: hydrogels,
silicones, and acrylics.The refractive power of a lens is a function of its shape and the refractive
index of the material of which it is made. A lens made from a material having a
higher refractive index can be thinner and provide the same refractive power as a lens
made from a material having a relatively lower refractive index.In general hydrogel materials have a relatively low refractive index, making
them less desirable than other materials because of the thicker lens optic necessary to
achieve a given refractive power. Silicone materials generally have a higher refractive
index than hydrogels, but tend to unfold explosively after being placed in the eye in a
folded position. Explosive unfolding can potentially damage the corneal endothelium 
and/or rupture the natural lens capsule of the eye. Acrylic materials are desirable
because they typically have a high refractive index and unfold more slowly or
controllably than silicone materials.U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,290,892 (Namdaran et al.), 5,331,073 (Weinschenk, III et al.),
and 5,693,095 (Freeman et al.)., the complete disclosures of which are hereby
incorporated by reference, discuss forming foldable lenses out of a polymer material
derived from an ethoxyaryl (meth)acrylate with a crosslinker or with a second acrylate
monomer and a crosslinker. Since the polymer material is soft/foldable, these patents
discuss mold forming the polymer material to individually form the lens which
requires specialized equipment and expensive customized molds. In addition, the
resulting molded lenses have poor surface quality since they cannot be polished.
Alternatively, there is discussion in U.S. Patent 5,331,073 of forming lenses from a
soft/foldable material by machining it at cryogenic temperatures.U.S. Pat. No. 4,668,446 (Kaplan et al.), the complete disclosure of which is
hereby incorporated by reference, alleviates the problems of mold forming the lenses
and the process difficulties and expense associated with
