<ABSTRACT>
An electrical receptacle terminal (2) comprises a 
wire connection section (4), a rectangular body section 

(6) and a pair of cantilever beam contacts (30) extending 
therefrom. Insertion of a male tab between the cantilever 

beam contacts (30) initially prises them resiliently apart 
whilst passing first protrusions (34) at a forward end 

(32) of the terminal, and then further biases apart the 
cantilever beam contacts (30) when inserted between second contact 

dimples (38) axially rearwards of the first protrusions 
(34). Electrical contact is finally made between the 

contact dimples (38) and the male tab, which due to the 
short lever arm and the point contact, has a high contact 

pressure thereby ensuring good electrical conductivity 
between the dimples (38) and the tab. Certain applications may 

require lower currents, and the insertion force can be further reduced 
by providing cutouts (22,26) in the terminal body 

section (6) to make the resilient cantilever beam contacts (30) more 
supple. The latter can be done without designing new 

connector housings or a new terminal, and requires only a 
small change in the stamping process, which provides for 

a cost-effective solution.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to an electrical receptacle
terminal that provides a high contact force yet results in a
low insertion force during mating with a complementary male
terminal.There is a continual demand in the electrical industry
to provide electrical terminals with ever increasing current
carrying capability but nevertheless being cost-effective and
requiring low insertion force when mated to a complementary
terminal. One of the important factors determining the
current carrying capability of an electrical terminal is the
resistance of the contact between mating terminals. The
contact resistance is largely influenced by the presence of
metal oxide layers or dirt, which increase the resistance, and
the contact pressure. In order to provide a small electrical
terminal that is reliable and has increased current carrying
capability, the terminal should Be simple and cheap to
manufacture, and have an increased contact pressure, provide
a means for eliminating oxide layers between contacts by a
wiping action, but nevertheless having low mating forces
between complementary terminals.DE-A-1 465 461 describes an electrical receptacle contact
for receiving a pin or a plate, which contact is stamped and
formed from sheet metal and has a mating section comprised of
opposed wiping arms each having axially spaced pairs of
laterally spaced contact points projecting inwardly from the
interior surface of the associated arm such that the contact
points cooperate to restrict lateral movement of a pin which
is inserted between the wiping arms.It is an object of this invention to provide a compact
electrical receptacle terminal which is cost-effective, has
a high current carrying capability and is reliable. It is
another object to provide such a terminal having a simple
means for adjusting the mating forces without substantial
modification of the design and manufacturing thereof, yet
maintaining the dimensions required for mounting in identical 
connector housings.The invention consists in an electrical receptacle
terminal stamped and formed from sheet metal, comprising a
body section having a pair of single resilient cantilever
beams extending therefrom, each cantilever beam having a first
protrusion proximate a male contact receiving end thereof,
the first protrusions being spaced apart by a distance such
that the cantilever beams are resilient biased apart during
preliminary insertion of a male contact axially received
therebetween and of a thickness greater than said distance,
and each cantilever beam having a

An electrical receptacle terminal stamped and formed
from sheet metal, comprising a body section (6) having a pair

of single resilient cantilever beams (30) extending therefrom,
each cantilever beam (30) having a first protrusion (34)

proximate a male contact receiving end (32) thereof, the first
protrusions being spaced apart by a distance such that the

cantilever beams are resiliently biased apart during preliminary
insertion of a male contact axially received therebetween and

of a thickness greater than said distance, and each cantilever
beam (30) having a second contact dimple (38) axially offset

from the first protrusion (34) towards the body section (6),
whereby the second contact dimples (38) are spaced apart

during preliminary insertion by a distance less than said
thickness of the male contact, characterized in that the body

section (6) is rectangular shaped having top (12), bottom (10)
and sidewalls (8), and the top (12) and bottom (10) walls of

the body section (6) comprise cutouts (22, 24, 26)centrally
disposed between the sidewalls (8) and extending axially along

the top and bottom walls for adjustment of the spring force
of the cantilever beams (30) by modification of the width or

length of the cutouts (22, 24, 26), the arrangement being such
that, during complete axial insertion of the male contact

between the second contact dimples (38), the cantilever beams
(30) are resiliently biased further apart and electrical

contact between the cantilever beams (30) and the male contact
is effected substantially by the second contact dimples (38).

extending into a flared lead-in portion (36) towards the male
contact receiving end (32) for guiding the male contact

section (34) and flared lead-in portion (36) extend across

substantially the whole width of the cantilever beam (30).

of the body section (6).

largest dimension is substantially axial.
