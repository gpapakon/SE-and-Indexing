<ABSTRACT>
A method of curing a dual-coated optical fiber is disclosed in which 
primary and secondary coating materials are simultaneously applied to a glass 

fiber 21 and then simultaneously cured. The primary coating material encloses and 
engages the glass fiber 21, while the secondary coating material encloses and 

engages the primary coating material. A photoinitiator is added to the primary and 
secondary coating materials. The photoinitiators respond to electromagnetic energy 

radiated from a source 30 of electromagnetic radiation comprising one or more 
curing 

lamps having identical emission spectra; however, the photoinitiator added to the 
primary coating material is selected to be substantially more responsive to the 

radiation source than the photoinitiator added to the secondary coating material. 
In 

one case, each photoinitiator responds to a different wavelength region of the 
emission spectrum of the curing lamps; and in another case, the photoinitiators 

both 
respond to the same region of the spectrum -- but are applied in different 

concentrations so that the primary coating material cures before the secondary 
coating material does.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to coated optical fibers and to a method of 
making same. More particularly, the invention relates to an optical fiber having inner 
and outer layers of curable coating materials that are individually cured by radiation at 
different wavelengths of the electromagnetic spectrum. In the manufacture of optical fiber, a glass preform rod is 
suspended vertically and moved into a furnace at a controlled rate. The preform 
softens in the furnace and a glass fiber (also referred to as an optical fiber) is drawn 
freely from the molten end of the preform rod by a capstan located at the base of a 
draw tower. Because the surface of the glass fiber is susceptible to damage caused 
by abrasion, it is necessary to coat the fiber after it is drawn but before it comes into 
contact with any surface. Inasmuch as the application of a coating material must not 
damage the glass surface, the coating material is applied in a liquid state. Once 
applied, the coating material must solidify before the glass fiber reaches the capstan. 
This is typically accomplished within a brief time interval by photocuring -- a process 
in which the liquid coating material is converted to a solid by exposure to 
electromagnetic radiation. Those optical fiber performance properties which are affected most by 
the coating material are strength and transmission loss. Coating defects which may 
expose the optical fiber to subsequent damage arise primarily from improper 
application of the coating material. Defects such as large bubbles or voids, non-concentric 
coatings with unacceptably thin regions, or intermittent coatings must be 
prevented. Intermittent coating is overcome by insuring that the fiber is suitably cool 
at its point of entry into the coating applicator to avoid coating flow instabilities. 
Coating concentricity can be monitored and adjustments made to maintain an 
acceptable value. Optical fibers are susceptible to a transmission loss mechanism known 
as microbending. Because the fibers are thin and flexible, they are readily bent when 
subjected to mechanical stresses such as those encountered during handling or 
exposure to varying temperature environments. If the stresses placed on the fiber 
result in a random bending distortion of the fiber axis with periodic components in the 
millimeter range, light rays, or modes, propagating in the fiber may escape from the 
core. These losses, termed microbending losses, may be very large, often many times 
the intrinsic loss of the fiber itself. The optical

A method of curing a dual-coated optical fiber, comprising the steps 
of: 


applying a primary coating material (42) to a glass fiber (21), the 
primary coating material including a first photoinitiator which is responsive to 

electromagnetic radiation residing in a first wavelength region; 
applying a secondary coating material (44) to the primary coating 
material, the secondary coating material including a second photoinitiator which is 

different than the first photoinitiator and which is responsive to electromagnetic 
radiation residing in a second wavelength region that is disjoint from the first 

wavelength region; and 
similtaneously exposing the primary and secondary coating materials to 
electromagnetic radiation whose emission spectrum has a peak intensity in the 

vicinity of the first wavelength region, and a substantially lower intensity in the 
vicinity of the second wavelength region; whereby, the curing rate of the primary 

coating material is increased with respect to the curing rate of the secondary coating 
material. 
The method of claim 1 further including the steps of: 

drawing the glass fiber (21) from a preform (22) prior to applying said 
primary (42) and secondary (44) coating materials; and 
taking up the drawn glass fiber onto a take-up reel after the primary and 
secondary coating materials have been cured.
