<ABSTRACT>
Self-reinforcing, pitch-based carbon articles having an unique combination of 
excellent thermal conductivity and outstanding mechanical properties are produced by 

carbonizing acid-treated mesophase pitch fiber, preferably in the form of a preform 
structure. The carbon articles having varying degrees of porosity are particularly 

desirable for use in thermal management and stiffness applications, and in carbon vapor 
infiltration processes employed in making complex solid carbon articles.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to articles comprising graphite and more particularly to high tensile
modulus compositions comprising highly oriented graphite.Carbon structures are widely used for applications where high temperatures will be
encountered and where heat dissipation is important such as, for example, in high energy
brake pads and in consumer electronic devices as electronic heat sinks. While a good
balance of mechanical properties continues to be important in such demanding
applications, high thermal conductivity and good dimensional stability have become
particularly important considerations. The thermal conductivity and dimensional stability
of solid carbon depends largely on its structure. Characteristically, these properties
improve as the crystallinity and density of the carbon increases. Solid amorphous carbon
may typically have a density near 1.2 g/cm3 a thermal conductivity as low as 100 w/m-øK,
while single crystal graphite has a density of about 2.26 g/cm3, a thermal conductivity
near 1800 w/m-øK ― considerably greater than the conductivity of copper ― and, unlike
metals, a negative coefficient of thermal expansion. These characteristics are highly
desired by users of carbon articles, and the art has expended considerable effort seeking
methods for producing carbon structures with such high densities reproducibly and with
good control.Highly ordered pyrolytic graphites having densities near 2.2 g/cm3 and good thermal
conductivity have been produced by vapor deposition of carbon. Highly oriented
pyrolytic graphite (HOPG) may have a thermal conductivity on the order of 800 w/m-øK.
However, the HOPG materials are extremely fragile, too brittle even for measurement of
mechanical properties such as tensile strength, and are extremely costly to produce. The
process is extremely costly, and is capable only of producing very small, extremely
fragile, wafer-like articles on the order of about 1.6 to 6.45 cm2 (about one-half to one inch square). HOPG
materials are thus severely limited in their application and have not found wide
acceptance.The bulk graphites widely used commercially for fabricating articles such as crucibles,
electrodes and the like are largely amorphous and relatively low in density, and lack the
high thermal conductivity of crystal graphite. To the extent particular bulk graphites may 
be crystalline, the crystalline component will comprise large, randomly-oriented graphitic
crystallites, generally greater in size than about 30 to 50 µm, embedded in a
substantially amorphous
