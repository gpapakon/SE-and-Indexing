(A1) compounds containing at least two 1,2-epoxide
groups per molecule and
(A2) polyoxyalkylenemonoamines having a molecular
weight (number average) greater than

900 g/mol, whose oxyalkylene groups are
selected from among oxypropylene and

oxyethylene groups, and which may contain a
mole fraction of from 0 to 20 % of oxyethylene

units based on the total amount of
