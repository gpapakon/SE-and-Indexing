<ABSTRACT>
A laminated flat cable uses a flat conductor which is 
treated substantially uniformly with an anticorrosion plating 

having a given thickness over the whole periphery thereof to 
provide a laminated flat cable which can provide a stable 

contact reliability with respect to a connector and a stable 
voltage withstand between conductors in a long period of use in 

which the cable is repeatedly inserted into and removed from 
the connector.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a flat conductor according to the 
preamble of claim 1 and its application for a laminated flat cable 
which is widely used as an internal wiring for various 
electronic machine application products such as an electronic 
desk-top computer, a printer, a copying machine and the like. A flat conductor according to the preamble of claim 1 is derivable 
from DE-A-1590 456. To manufacture a laminated flat cable, a plurality of 
flat conductors are disposed at a predetermined interval in 
parallel to one another, and two polyester films each having 
polyester system adhesives attached thereto are laminated onto 
the upper and lower surfaces of the flat conductors from above 
and below with the adhesives attached surfaces of the two 
polyester films facing each other, thereby producing an 
insulating layer. This type of flat cable provides a small 
space factor and is thus advantageous in making a compact 
machine. Therefore, the flat cable is used in various 
machines. In particular, there has been frequently used a 
method in which, while the conductor of the flat cable existing 
in one surface of the end portion of the flat cable is exposed, 
the flat cable is used in combination with a removable 
connector (that is, a connector which allows insertion and 
removal), because the method is convenient in handling, for  
 
example, it allows easy change and replacement of parts, 
wirings and the like. As the method using a combination of the removable 
connector with the flat cable of this type has been spread, 
there has arisen a request for a stable contact reliability 
with respect to the removable connector which have to be 
frequently inserted into and removed from the flat cable of 
this type for a long period of use. In addition as the results 
of various tests for enhancement of the contact reliability 
with respect to the removable connector, found is that the 
contact reliability for a long period of use is closely 
connected with an anticorrosion plating to be enforced on the 
conductor. In other words, as a conductor to be used in the 
laminated flat cable of this type, when an anticorrosion plated 
copper foil is slit into a given width and is then used, that 
is, such slit copper foil is used in a state in which the slit 
surface thereof does not include any anticorrosion plating, 
then the conductor of this type raises a problem as to the 
contact reliability in a long period of use; on the other hand, 
when the conductor is used after the slit surface thereof is
