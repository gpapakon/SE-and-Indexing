<ABSTRACT>
A hair growth promoting aerosol formulation having a 
hair growth promoter composition in a gel form containing 

as effective components a crude drug extract having an 
effect of promoting the circulation of blood and a 

vitamin or a derivative thereof, and a water-soluble 
polymer by which the hair growth promoter composition is 

gelatinized; and a propellant. There is also disclosed 
an aerosol product of a hair growth promoter prepared by 

filling the above-mentioned hair growth promoting aerosol

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a hair growth 
promoting aerosol formulation having not only hair growth 
promoting effects, but also appropriate hair setting 
effects. In addition, the present invention also relates 
to an aerosol product using the above-mentioned hair 
growth promoting aerosol formulation. Conventional hair growth promoters are in a liquid 
form to be directly applied onto the scalp. This kind of 
hair growth promoters can impart a cooling sensation to 
the users, but cannot contribute to the setting of their 
hair. In recent years, many aerosol products of hair 
growth promoters have entered the market. These hair 
growth promoters are also in liquid form. This causes a 
problem where the hair growth promoter tends to drip from 
the end of the hairs immediately after spraying onto the 
scalp. In addition to this, these hair growth promoters 
do not provide the hair setting effect.  There is an increasing demand for the development of 
a hair growth promoting aerosol formulation having not 
only the hair growth promoting effect, but also the hair 
setting effect, and an aerosol product using such a hair 
growth promoting aerosol formulation. There is proposed an aerosol formulation for the 
human body as disclosed in Japanese Laid-Open Patent 
Application 4-89423, which is characterized by comprising 
a propellant and a composition in a gel form which is 
obtained by use of a carboxyvinyl polymer, that is a 
water-soluble polymer serving to gelatinize the 
composition as used in the present invention. In this application there is a technical idea of 
applying the formulation in the gel form to an aerosol 
product, but not to an aerosol product of a hair growth 
promoter. Specifically, no suggestion is made in the 
application of the effective components of a hair growth 
promoter, that is, a hair growth promoter capable of 
smoothly reaching the scalp and setting the hairs to a 
proper extent. Furthermore, in the above-mentioned application, 
there is no technical idea of preparing an aerosol 
product using the formulation which contains as the 
effective component the extract of a crude drug having an 
effect of promoting the circulation of the blood.  
 
Conventionally, in the case where the aerosol formulation 
is made using the extract of a crude drug, sediments are 
generated, and the settling sediments are accumulated at 
the bottom of an aerosol container during the storage. 
For the spraying operation, the contents are pumped from 
the bottom of the container at one stroke,
