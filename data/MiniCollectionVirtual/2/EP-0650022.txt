<ABSTRACT>
Processes for the removal of fluid adhering to surfaces of objects to be treated by means of compressed-air jets emerging from orifices in air-jet devices and directed onto the objects to be treated are known. Processes of this type are used, for example, for removing electroplating fluid adhering to surfaces. The disadvantage of the known processes is that stainless drying is impossible or is possible only at a considerable outlay in terms of apparatus. A process and an arrangement, in which, for stainless drying, air-jet devices, from which the compressed-air jets emerge, are set in oscillating movement in at least one plane, are therefore described. As a result, the fluid on the surface of the object to be treated is essentially atomised and consequently removed rapidly from this. The remaining surface moisture can evaporate. Heated compressed air is used to assist the evaporation.

Method for the spotless removal of drops or liquid, which
adhere to surfaces of articles to be treated (2), by means

of compressed-air jets which are constantly directed from
apertures (6) in at least one air jet member (3) towards

a plane in which the article to be treated is situated,
wherein a relative movement (10,11) between the air jet

member and the article to be treated is provided, and the
air jet member is moved in an oscillating manner in at

least one plane, and wherein the frequencies of the
oscillating movements of the air jet member and the

pressure of the compressed-air jets are selected to be so
high that the liquid is substantially sprayed-off.
Method according to claim 1, characterised in that
the air jet member (3) executes torsional movements (8,9)

about one of the axes of the air jet member and executes
linear pivotal movements (13) in the direction of the axis

about which the torsional movement of the air jet member
is effected.
Method according to claim 2, characterised in
that the apertures (6), which are configured as

displaceable nozzles, execute torsional movements about
axes which are offset, by an angle of roughly 90Â°, from

the axis of the air jet member (3), about which axis the
torsional movements (8,9) are effected, or in the direction

of which axis the linear pivotal movements (13) are
effected.
Method according to one of the preceding claims,
characterised in that the frequencies and amplitudes of the

movements of the air jet members (3) and/or nozzles (6) are
adjusted to predetermined values automatically or manually,

depending on the nature of the article to be treated (2). 
Method according to one of the preceding claims,
characterised in that the article to be treated (2)

executes the relative movement (10,11).
Method according to one of claims 1 to 4,
characterised in that the air jet member (3) executes the

relative movement (10,11).
Method according to one of claims 1 to 5,
characterised in that the article to be treated (2) is

transported in the horizontal direction between at least
two air jet members (3).
Method according to one of the preceding claims,
characterised in that the movements of a plurality of air

jet members (3) are synchronised with one another.
Apparatus for the spotless removal of drops or liquid, which
adhere to surfaces of articles to be treated, by means of

compressed-air jets, which are constantly directed towards
a plane in which each article to be treated (2) is

situated, including at least one air jet member (3) with
apertures for the compressed-air jets and means (10,11) to

move the air jet members past stationary articles to be
treated, and additional means to produce at least one

oscillating movement of the air jet members in at least
one plane, the additional means for producing the

oscillating movement and the air jet members being
configured in such a manner that the frequencies of the

oscillating movements of the air jet members and the
pressure of the compressed-air jets are selectable to be so

high that the liquid can be substantially sprayed-off.
Apparatus according to claim 9, characterised in
that the air jet members (3) extend longitudinally, and

the apertures (6) are disposed on at least one generatrix
of the air jet members. 
Apparatus according to one of claims 9 and 10,
characterised in that means are provided for producing

torsional movements (8,9) about one of the axes of the air
jet member (3) and linear pivotal movements (13) in the

direction of the axis about which the torsional movement of
the air jet member is effected.
Apparatus according to claim 11, characterised in
that a linear drive or a rotary drive with an eccentric or

cam plate is provided for the execution of the torsional
movements (8,9), and an axially operating pivotal drive is

provided for the execution of linear pivotal movements
(13).
Apparatus according to one of claims 9 to 12,
characterised in that a plurality of air jet members (3)

are provided, which are disposed at an angle to one
another, and in that the axial directions of said members

are disposed substantially parallel to the article to be
treated (2).
Apparatus according to one of claims 9 to 13,
characterised in that the air jet members (3) are disposed

on a transporting carriage.
Apparatus according to one of claims 9 to 13,
characterised in that the air jet members (3) are disposed

in a horizontal position in a stationary manner on at least
one side of a container for the article to be treated (2).
Apparatus according to one of claims 9 to 15,
characterised in that at least two oppositely situated air

jet members (3) are provided with a guide member, which is
disposed therebetween, for guiding the article to be

treated (2), which is to be moved through the arrangement.
