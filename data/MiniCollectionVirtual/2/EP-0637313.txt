A process for the single-stage or multistage separation 
of aliphatic alcohols containing up to 30 carbon 

atoms and, more particularly, 6 to 18 carbon atoms by 
distillation from a mixture of alkyl glycosides and 

alcohols remaining unreacted in the production of these 
alkyl glycosides with a falling film evaporator for 

stripping the reaction mixture to residual alcohol 
contents of 5% by weight or lower, a linear load of the 

falling film evaporator of at least 1.0 m
3
/h and m total 
circumference of the tubes, preferably of at least 1.8 

m
3
/h m and, more preferably, of at least 3.0 m
3
/h m being 
established. 
A process as claimed in claim 1, characterized in 
that it is carried out in several stages, more particularly 

two stages, and a falling film evaporator is used 
as the evaporator in each stage. 
A process as claimed in claim 2, characterized in 
that the reaction mixture is reduced in the preliminary 

stages to an alcohol content of 5 to 50% by weight and, 
more particularly, 10 to 30% by weight. 
A process as claimed in claim 1, characterized in 
that the process is carried out in only one stage. 
A process as claimed in claim 4, characterized in 
that the reaction mixture is passed only once through the 

falling film evaporator, a linear load of at least 3.0 
m
3
/h m being established. 
A process as claimed in claim 4, characterized in 
that the process is carried out with forced external 

circulation and a ratio of feed to circulating liquid of 
1:100 to 1:5 and a linear load of at least 1.0 m
3
/h m are 
established. 
A process as claimed in any of claims 1 to 3, 
characterized in that, in a multistage process, a sump 

temperature of 100 to 220째C and, more particularly, 140  
 

to 200째C and an operating pressure of 0.5 to 20 mbar and, 
more particularly, 1 to 10 mbar are established for the 

stages preceding the last stage. 
A process as claimed in any of claims 1 to 7, 
characterized in that single-stage processes and the last 

evaporator stage of multistage processes are carried out 
at sump temperatures of 120 to 250째C and, more particularly, 

160 to 230째C and under operating pressures of 0.1 
to 10 mbar and, more particularly, 0.5 to 5 mbar.
