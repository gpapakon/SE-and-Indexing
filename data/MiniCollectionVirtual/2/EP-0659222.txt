<DESCRIPTION>
The field of the present invention in general
is the use of transition metal-derived agents in the
delignification of wood or wood pulp. Specifically,
the field of the present invention is the use of
vanadium-substituted polyoxometalates in wood pulp
bleaching.Pulping. The transition of a tree into paper
involves several discrete stages. Stage one is the
debarking of the tree and the conversion of the tree
into wood chips. Stage two is the conversion of
wood chips into pulp. This conversion may be by
either mechanical or chemical means.Bleaching is the third stage. Delignification
is the first step in the bleaching of chemical
pulps. Lignin, a complex polymer derived from
aromatic alcohols, is one of the main constituents
of wood. During the early stages of bleaching,
residual lignin, which constitutes 3-6% of the pulp,
is removed. Currently, this is typically done by 
treatment of the pulp with elemental chlorine at low
pH, followed by extraction with hot alkali. Once a
significant portion of the residual lignin has been
removed, the pulp may be whitened, by a variety of
means, to high brightness. Chlorine dioxide is
commonly used in the brightening step.Although chlorine compounds are effective and
relatively inexpensive, their use in pulp mills
results in the generation and release of chlorinated
organic materials, including dioxins, into rivers
and streams. Due to increasing regulatory pressures
and consumer demand, new, non-chlorine bleaching
technologies are urgently needed by manufacturers of
paper-grade chemical pulps.In recent years, attention has been drawn to
the potential use of enzymatic processes associated
with fungal degradation of lignin to develop
environmentally friendly technologies for the pulp
and paper industry. In many wood-rotting fungi,
extracellular metalloenzymes such as glyoxal
oxidase, a copper-containing oxidase, in combination
with lignin and manganese peroxidases, both of which
contain iron in a protoheme active site, harness the
oxidative capability of dioxygen and direct its
reactivity to the degradation of lignin within the 
fiber walls. In this biochemical process, high
valent transition metal ions serve as conduits for
the flux of electrons from lignin to dioxygen.Therefore, transition metal ions are known to
possess redox properties that are useful in the
delignification and bleaching of lignocellulosic
materials. However, the behavior of transition
metal ions in water is often difficult to control.
In aqueous solution, complex equilibria are
established between
