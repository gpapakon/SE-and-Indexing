<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to the healing of wounds
and other conditions in which fibrosis is a major
mechanism of tissue repair or where excessive fibrosis
leads to pathological derangement and malfunctioning of
the tissues. It refers in particular to agents and
techniques for facilitating repair and healing of animal
tissues, without excessive fibrosis, and for preventing
or treating diseases and conditions of fibrosis.Fibrosis is a major problem in wound healing
causing scarring of the tissue, which not only looks
unsightly, but also causes problems in respect of growth
of the tissue, function, movement etc. This is
particularly true following injuries to children or
following major burns.In addition, fibrosis is a major medical problem
where abnormal or excessive deposition of fibrous tissue
occurs in many diseases, including liver cirrhosis,
glomerulonephritis, pulmonary fibrosis, systemic
fibrosis, rheumatoid arthritis, as well as wound healing.The mechanism of fibrosis is still not fully
understood, but wound healing usually begins as an 
inflammatory reaction with leucocyte infiltration and accumulation of cytokines. These
cytokines are responsible for the proliferation of fibroblasts and the deposition of
extracellular matrix proteins (including collagen and fibronectin) which accumulate and
result in permanent alteration in tissue structure and function.Examples of the regulatory cytokines include tumor necrosis factor (TNF), fibroblast
growth factors (FGF's), platelet derived growth factor (PDGF) and transforming growth
factor β (TGFβ), (TGFβ-1 to TGF-5 have so far been identified). Two of these cytokine
families, TGFβ and PDGF, have been reported to be highly fibrogenic, and, moreover,
inhibition of two or the TGFβ's and PDGF activity, using anti-TGFβ-1, anti-TGFβ-2 and anti
- PDGF antibodies, has been shown to diminish fibrosis in tissue injury (Shah et al, The
Lancet, 339, 213-214, 1992; WO 91/04748).The present invention provides novel uses of compositions useful in the treatment of
wounds and fibrotic disorders and which may prevent, inhibit or reverse fibrosis.According to a first aspect of the present invention there is provided the use of TGFβ-3
in the manufacture of a medicament for reducing scarring.The medicament comprises a healing composition containing TGFβ-3 in combination
with a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier. The composition may comprise TGFβ-3 as the or a non-fibrotic growth factor, such
that on application of the composition to the tissue, this non-fibrotic growth factor

The use according to claim 5, wherein the anti-fibrotic agent is selected from the
group of: (a) antibodies to TGFβ-1, TGFβ-2 and PDGF; (b) binding proteins which prevent

TGFβ-1, TGFβ-2 and PDGF from binding to their receptors by either binding to the growth
factor itself or binding to the receptor; (c) soluble forms of TGFβ1, TGFβ2 or PDGF growth

factor receptor or binding domains of these receptors; or (d) antisense oligonucleotides or
ribozymes which act to prevent fibrotic growth factor mRNA translation.

stimulus to release the active form of the agent.
The use according to claim 10, wherein the external stimulus includes UV light,
ultrasound, 
in vivo
 enzymes or heat.
The use according to claim 9, wherein inactivation of the agent is by the molecular
addition of a binding molecule which is detachable when required by an external stimulus

including UV light, ultrasound, 
in vivo
 enzymes or heat.

form.
