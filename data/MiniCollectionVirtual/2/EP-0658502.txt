<ABSTRACT>
A device (10) for loading a silo vehicle or suchlike silo containers with pourable bulk material (54) possesses a closable falling shaft (40) for the bulk material (54). The lower end of the falling shaft (40) can be closed by means of a closing part (22). By means of an attachment cone (44), the device can be attached in a dust-proof manner on the filling orifice (48) of the silo vehicle. The falling shaft (40) consists of tubular portions (16) which can be inserted telescopically in one another. The closing part of the falling shaft (40) is designed as an outlet cone (22) and is arranged with its outlet face (24) at a distance from the lower edge (26) of the lowest tubular portion (16.4) which leaves an annular gap free.

Device (10) for loading a silo vehicle or similar

silo container with flowable bulk material (54), with

a chute (40) for the bulk material (54) with tube
sections (16) which can be inserted telescopically one

into another and the cross-section of which increases in
the downward direction,
an offtake duct, present outside the chute (40), for
carrying off the bulk material/air mixture which escapes

during filling,
a set-down cone (44) for the dustproof setting down
of the device on the filling opening (48) of the silo

vehicle, which cone forms the outer lower casing of the
offtake duct,
a closing part, designed as an outlet cone (22) and
arranged at the lower edge of the lowest tube section

(16.4), for closing the lower end of the set-down cone
(44),
a pull device (20, 32) for raising and lowering the
lower mouth of the device, characterized in that
the lowest tube section (16.4) too has a cross-section
which is smaller than the clear cross-section of

the set-down cone (44), so that, when the device rests on
the filling opening (48), the chute (40) can be guided

downwards through the filling opening (48),
the outlet cone (22) is always arranged with its
outlet surface (24) at a distance from the lower edge

(26) of the lowest tube section (16.4) which leaves an
annular gap open.
Device according to Claim 1, characterized in 
that the pull device (20, 32) is fastened in the upper

edge region of the lowest tube section (16.4).
Device according to Claim 1 or 2, characterized in
that a distance piece (80) is present in the interspace

between the set-down cone (44) and the chute (40), by
means of which the lower mouth edge (84) of the set-down

cone (44) is kept at such a distance from the tube
sections (16) that the pull device (32) for the outlet

cone cannot become caught between the mouth edge (84) and
the tube sections of the set-down cone (44).
Device according to Claim 3, characterized in
that the distance piece is an annular disc (80) which

surrounds the tube section loosely.
Device according to Claim 4, characterized in
that the annular disc (80) can rest loosely on the upper

edge of a tube section (16).
Device according to one of the preceding claims,
characterized in that a recognition arrangement (60) is

present in such a manner that the position of a
predetermined point of the chute (40) can be detected in

the region of the set-down cone (44).
Device according to Claim 6, characterized in
that at least one proximity switch (60) is present in the

outer region of the lowest tube section (16.4), by means
of which, at a predefinable distance from the set-down

cone (44), a switching signal for stopping the filling
operation can be generated.
Device according to Claim 7, characterized in
that the proximity switch is an inductive proximity

switch (60).
Device according to one of the preceding claims,
characterized in that the pull device (32) contains at

least one pull means which can be wound up or unwound by
only one winch.
Device according to one of the preceding claims,
characterized in that a filling level indicator (30) is

present on the outlet cone (22).
Device according to Claim 10, characterized in
that an electric filling level indicator (30) is present. 
Device according to Claim 11, characterized in
that the filling level indicator is a vibration probe

(30).
