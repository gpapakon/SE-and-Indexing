<ABSTRACT>
This application relates to storage stable beverage concentrates for preparing beverages and food compositions which are nutritionally supplemented with significant levels of calcium and to a method for preparing these concentrates. The beverage concentrates have a greater than 5 fold concentration and comprise: (a) from about 0.2 % to about 1.20 %, by weight, solubilized calcium; (b) from about 0.7 % to about 8.25 %, by weight, of an acid component comprising a mixture of citric acid and malic acid wherein said mixture has a weight ratio of citric acid to malic acid of from about 5:95 to about 50:50; (c) from about 0.05 % to about 1.2 %, by weight, of an acidic anion component selected from the group consisting of chloride ion, nitrate ion, sulfate ion and mixtures thereof; (d) an effective amount of a flavor component; and (e) from about 35 % to about 80 % sugar by weight on a dry basis; (f) from about 20 % to about 65 %, by weight, water; wherein the weight ratio of said acid component to said solubilized calcium is from about 3.5 to about 6.5 and said beverage concentrate has a pH of less than or equal to about 4.5, preferably less than or equal to about 3.5. These beverage concentrates are stable at temperatures of greater than 90  DEG F (32  DEG C) for at least about 30 days. An added benefit is their stability for at least about 120 days at temperatures of from about 70  DEG F (21  DEG C) to about 90  DEG F (32  DEG C).

<DESCRIPTION>
This application relates to storage stable beverage concentrates
for preparing beverages and food compositions which are
nutritionally supplemented with significant levels of calcium.
This application particularly relates to beverage concentrates, of
greater than 5-fold, which provide for excellent stability at high
temperatures. This application further relates to a method for
preparing these concentrates.Dietary calcium inadequacy may be a contributing cause to
osteoporosis for some populations. For example, a positive
correlation between calcium intake and bone mass has been found
across many age groups. It has been suggested that the level of
calcium intake early in life directly influences the peak bone
mass achieved at skeletal maturity.Calcium can be obtained from a variety of dietary sources.
The primary sources of calcium are dairy products, in particular
milk. However, beginning in young adulthood and continuing
through later life, milk is typically not consumed in sufficient
quantities by the general population to obtain needed levels of
calcium. This may be caused by lactose intolerance as well as by
the unattractiveness of milk as a drink for "social occasions."To achieve a greater consumption of calcium throughout life,
more appealing alternatives to milk are needed. Such beverages
must be consumed in sufficient quantities to provide nutritionally
beneficial amounts of calcium. Therefore, non-dairy product
beverages which comprise a milk level of calcium, 0.12% by weight, 
are in demand. To this end, soft drinks and fruit juice products
have been devised which are fortified with calcium.In order to save on shipping and packaging costs, concentrated
beverages are preferred. These beverages are diluted at the
time of consumption. Greater than 5-fold concentrates are highly
preferred for economic reasons. However, as these beverages
become more concentrated, the water level decreases therefore
making it more difficult to solubilize calcium and sugar.British Patent 2,207,335, Buisson et al., published February
1, 1989, discloses three-fold to five-fold beverage concentrates
comprising solubilized calcium; an edible acid component comprising
citric, malic, fumaric, adipic, gluconic, tartaric and lactic
acids; chloride and a flavor component containing no more than 20%
fruit juice on a single strength basis.U.S. Patent 4,722,847, Heckert, issued February 2, 1988,
discloses three-fold to five-fold calcium supplemented fruit juice
concentrates which are substantially free of added protein. The
