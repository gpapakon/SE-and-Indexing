Polypeptide IFN-γ C-1OL with the following amino acid sequence:

DNA sequence which codes for a polypeptide with the following amino acid sequence:

Plasmid DNA with the deposit number DSM 6238, which codes for the following amino acid
sequence:


Manufacture of the plasmid DNA according to claim 3, characterized in that the 5' non-translated
region as well as a part of the coded region of a cDNA with 1 194 base pairs and 143 amino acids is

removed by cleaving with a restriction endonuclease and in that the 3' non-translated region as well as a
part of the coded region of the cDNA is also removed by cleaving with a restriction endonuclease and in

that this gene is inserted into the plasmid PKK 233-2 in bacteria cells.
Manufacture according to claim 4, characterized in that the bacteria cell is E. coli.
Manufacture according to claim 4 or 5, characterized in that the restriction endonuclease for
cleaving the 5' region and the leader sequence is Ava II.
Manufacture of the plasmid DNA according to claim 4 to 6, characterized in that the restriction
endonuclease for cleaving the 3' non-translated region as well as a part of the coded region is the

restriction endonuclease Hinf I.
Manufacture of the polypeptide according to claim 1, characterized by the combination of the
following features,


a) the IFN-γ C-10L is expressed from the plasmid DNA according to claim 3 and
b) the bacteria cells are broken up after completed expression and the inclusion bodies which are
obtained are freed from soluble bacterial proteins by washing and
c) the inclusion bodies are brought into solution by denaturation and then subjected to a renaturation
step and
d) the interferon-γ C-10L is purified.
Manufacture according to claim 8, characterized in that the interferon-γ C-10L is concentrated
by a cation exchange process in a batch method and is then highly purified by a gel filtration.
Manufacture according to claim 8 or 9, characterized in that the bacteria cells are broken up
mechanically, e.g. by ultra-sound.
Manufacture according to claim 8 to 10, characterized in that the cation exchange material is
brought into uniform contact with the IFN-γ C-10L solution in the batch method, in order to obtain

uniform coating of the resin, and in that it is then washed in the batch and eluted. 
Manufacture according to claim 8 to 11, characterized in that customary materials are used as
cation exchangers, such as CM-cellulose or Affi-gel blue for example.
A polypeptide according to claim I for use as a medicament.
A polypeptide according to claim 13 for use as a medicament for combatting rheumatism and
cancer of the kidney.
Use of the polypeptide according to claim 1 as a fine chemical for in vitro research, e.g. for
interferon mirror measurement.
