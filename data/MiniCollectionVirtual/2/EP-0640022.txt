<ABSTRACT>
A plasma gun assembly (12) for use in high temperature environments couples electrode and cooling water supplying hoses (30 and 32) to a plasma gun (18) via an extension arrangement having a conductive cathode extension tube (32) coaxially disposed within a conductive anode extension tube (48). The cooling water flows through the hollow interior of the cathode extension tube (72) to the plasma gun (18), then returns from the plasma gun via a passage formed between the outside of the cathode extension tube (72) and the interior wall of the anode extension tube (48). In this manner the anode and cathode extension tubes are cooled as well as the plasma gun. Powder and plasma gas are supplied to the plasma gun (18) by water-cooled tube arrangements in which such tubes (36 and 40) are surrounded by intermediate and outer tubes forming separate passages. Cooling water is coupled via fittings to flow through the passages formed by the intermediate and outer tubes (124 and 130) to provide cooling.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to plasma systems
capable of thermal spraying of powdered materials for
coating on a workpiece.It is known to provide a plasma system in which
powders of metal or other composition are delivered to
a plasma gun for introduction into a plasma stream or
flame produced by the plasma gun. The plasma stream,
which is created by a flow of inert gas with the
application of an electrical power source and typically
in the presence of low pressure, provided by a vacuum
source, is directed from the plasma gun onto a
workpiece or other target where the powder is deposited
to form a coating. The powder, which may be preheated
before introduction into the plasma stream at the gun,
melts as it is entrained into and carried by the plasma
stream so that a relatively dense coating is formed on
the workpiece.An example of such a plasma system is provided by
U.S. Patent 4,328,257 of Muehlberger et al., which
patent issued May 4, 1982 and is commonly assigned with
the present application. In the plasma system
described in the Muehlberger et al. patent, a low
pressure source in the form of vacuum pumps is coupled
to an enclosure containing a plasma gun and a workpiece
to direct the plasma stream from the plasma gun to the
workpiece at supersonic speeds. A powder feed
mechanism heats and delivers powder into the side of
the plasma gun for introduction into the plasma stream.In plasma systems of the type described in the '257
patent of Muehlberger et al., the plasma gun which has
an anode and a cathode is water cooled by supplying
cooling water from a water booster pump to a water
inlet. From the water inlet, the cooling water 
circulates through a predetermined path within the
plasma gun before exiting via a water outlet for return
to the water booster pump. Cooling water from the
water booster pump is provided to the water inlet of
the plasma gun by a hose having a conductive inner tube
which functions as the cathode connection to the plasma
gun and which is coupled to a plasma power supply. The
water outlet of the plasma gun is coupled by a second
hose to return the water to the water booster pump.
The second hose has a conductive inner tube which
functions as the anode connection to the plasma gun and
which is coupled to the plasma power supply. A tube
coupled to a powder feed mechanism provides powder to
the plasma gun with the help of a carrier gas flowing
under pressure. Another tube couples a source of inert
plasma gas to the plasma gun to provide plasma gas to
the gun. Document US-A-3 684
