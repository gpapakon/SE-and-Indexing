<ABSTRACT>
The device contains a part (7) co-rotating with the weaving rotor (2) and having reception channels (11) for the weft-thread feed and contains a part (8) stationary relative to the weaving rotor (2) and having connecting channels (10) for the weft-thread feed. The parts (7, 8) are arranged axially relative to one another and are held in a working position by a force accumulator (24) in such a way that a gap is present between the first and second parts (7, 8), means being provided to adjust the width of the gap and keep it constant. The second part (8) is axially displaceable relative to the first part (7) and is connected to an actuator device (3), in order to pull the second part (8) into an open position in order to expose the reception and connecting channels (10, 11) intended for the weft-thread feed.

A device for the distribution of weft threads to weft 
ducts of the rotor of a series shed loom having an air-jet 

picking system, which device comprises a first part 
(7) rotating with the rotor (2) and having a number of 

transfer ducts (11) for the weft thread supply and a 
second part (8) stationary in relation to the rotor and 

having a number of connecting ducts (10) for the weft 
thread supply, which are disposed coaxially to one 

another via at least one rolling bearing (14) and which 
are retained in an operating position by means of energy 

storing devices (23) so that there is a gap (9) between 
the opposite faces of the parts (7, 8),
characterised in that
 an operating mechanism (3) is 
provided, which is disposed in an axially displaceable 

manner in relation to the rotor (2),
and in that
 the operating mechanism (3) is in effective 
communication with the second part (2) in order to 

displace the second part (8) axially in relation to the 
first part (7) against the action of the energy storing 

devices (23) and to uncover the transfer and connecting 
ducts (10, 11) intended for the weft supply. 
A device according to Claim 1,
characterised in that
 the operating mechanism (3) 
comprises a piston arrangement (25 - 28) which can be 

pressurised by means of fluid in order to displace the 
second part (8) axially with respect to the first part 

(7). 
A device according to one of Claims 1 or 2,
characterised in that
 the energy storing devices (23) are 
disposed in the operating mechanism (3) in order to 

return the second part (8) into the operating position.  
 
A device according to Claim 1,
characterised in that
 a mechanism is provided in order to 
keep the first and second part (7, 8) at a distance from 

one another and to form the gap (9). 
A device according to Claim 4,
characterised in that
 the mechanism comprises at least 
three support units (30) which form a three-point 

support. 
A device according to Claim 5,
characterised in that
 the support units (30) are 
adjustable in order to adjust the width of the gap (9). 
A device according to one of Claims 5 or 6,
characterised in that
 each support unit (30) can firstly 
be adjusted without clearance and secondly can be fixed 

in a predetermined position. 
A series shed loom having an air-jet picking system and 
having a device according to one of Claims 1 to 7,
characterised by
 a mechanism for monitoring the width of 
the gap (9) between the first and second part (7, 8).
