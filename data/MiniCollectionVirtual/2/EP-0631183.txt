<CLAIMS>
Colour photographic material which contains on a 
support at least one blue-sensitive silver halide 

emulsion layer containing at least one yellow coupler, 
at least one green-sensitive silver halide emulsion 

layer containing at least one magenta coupler, at 
least one red-sensitive silver halide emulsion layer 

containing at least one cyan coupler, together with 
conventional non-photosensitive layers, characterised 

in that at least one blue-sensitive layer containing a 
yellow coupler contains a compound of the formula (I) 


 
in which
