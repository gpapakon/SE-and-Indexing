Transfer bridge for platforms (4), having a bridge 
plate (1) which is pivotable at its platform end about a 

horizontal axis (3), and an extension member (7) which is 
disposed at the free end of the bridge plate (1) and is 

pivotable from the substantially perpendicular inoperative 
position into an operative position, corresponding 

substantially to the bridge plane, for deposit and support 
on the deck to be loaded or unloaded, the extension member 

(7) being pivotally mounted on a transversely extending pin 
(8), which is mounted in an eyelet (9) of a holder (10), 

which is securely connected to the bridge plate (1), 
characterised in that the holder (10) abuts against the 

underside of a cover plate (5) of the bridge plate (1) and 
surrounds a rod (13) with its rear platform end in an 

arcuate manner, which rod extends transversely to the 
bridge plate (1), and said holder is supported in the 

region of its front end by a bar (14), which extends 
parallel to the rod (13). 
Bridge according to claim 1, characterised in that 
the bar (14) and the rod (13) traverse recesses (17), 

corresponding to their cross-section, in support members 
(6), which extend longitudinally relative to the bridge 

plate (1). 
Bridge according to claim 1, characterised in that 
the holder (10) has a projection member (18) on its upper 

side, which projection member is disposed in front of the 
end face (20) of the cover plate (5) of the bridge plate 

(1) and forms a stop member for the upwardly pivoted 
extension member (7). 
Bridge according to claim 1, characterised in that 
the abutment faces (12,22), situated on the upper side of 

the holder (10), for the underside of the extension member  
 

(7) and of the cover plate (5) of the extension member (7) 
lie in planes of different height and are so disposed that 

the upper face of the bridge plate (1) and the upper face 
of the extension member (7) lie in one plane. 
Bridge according to claim 1, characterised in that 
the holder (10) is defined forwardly by a vertical abutment 

face (24) for the underside of the extension member (7). 
Bridge according to claim 1, characterised in that 
the rod (13) has a circular cross-section, and the recess 

for accommodating the rod (13) in the holder (10) has a 
substantially semicircular configuration. 
Bridge according to claims 1 and 6, characterised 
in that the platform end of the holder (10) is shaped 

substantially in the form of a portion of an arc. 
Bridge according to claim 7, characterised in that 
the radial extension of the arc (15) corresponds 

practically to the spacing between the rod (13) and the 
cover plate (5). 
Bridge according to claims 1, 7 and 8, 
characterised in that the holder (10) abuts in a 

practically clearance-free manner against the cover plate 
(5), against the rod (13) and against the bar (14). 
Bridge according to claim 3, characterised in that 
the projection member (18) abuts against the end face (20).
