<ABSTRACT>
A filter material is described which is composed exclusively of celluloses and cellulose derivatives. In addition to cellulose acetate fibres, the filter layer has as additives microcrystalline cellulose and microfine cellulose or only microcrystalline cellulose. The proportions vary depending on composition, the proportion of microcrystalline cellulose being able to be up to 70% by weight and that of microfine cellulose being able to be up to 50% by weight. Cellulose acetate fibres can be dispensed with if, instead, microcrystalline cellulose having particle sizes 
<
 10  mu m is used. The production process provides that cellulose acetate fibres are first mixed with microfine cellulose and microcrystalline cellulose in the wet state and that differently treated celluloses are then added. The mash formed by mixing is made into a nonwoven web by means of a felting process known per se, which nonwoven web is then dried. By means of layers of this filter material, clarifying effects up to and including the sterilising range are achieved which are comparable with known kieselguhr layers.
