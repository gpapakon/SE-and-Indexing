<ABSTRACT>
A method and apparatus for optimizing the performance of a rate-responsive cardiac pacemaker. A pacemaker is provided which is capable of obtaining and storing information about a patient's cardiac function and about a pacemaker's operation during a brief exercise interval. The data collected includes information about the number of cardiac events during each two-second interval of the exercise, as well as the percentage of paced events during each two-second interval. Data reflecting the output of the pacemaker's activity sensor output is also collected for each two-second interval of the test. In addition, AV interval data for each cardiac cycle during the test is collected, this data being distinguished according to whether it reflects atrial-pace-to-ventricular-sense or atrial-sense-to-ventricular-sense AV intervals. The disclosed pacemaker is operable in conjunction with an external programming/processing unit, which receives the stored data after the exercise test is concluded. The data is processed and presented on the programmer screen in a manner which enables the clinician to readily assimilate it and observe the effects of hypothetical changes in rate-response programming in the pacemaker. Additionally, the clinician is able to observe the programmed AV rate adaption profiles in conjunction with the patient's actual AV performance, and compare this data with an AV profile from a typical healthy heart.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to the field of implantable medical devices, and
more particularly relates to cardiac pacemakers with variable pacing rate.A wide variety of cardiac pacemakers are known and commercially
available. Pacemakers are generally characterized by which chambers of the
heart they are capable of sensing, the chambers to which they deliver pacing
stimuli, and their responses, if any, to sensed intrinsic electrical cardiac activity.
Some pacemakers deliver pacing stimuli at fixed, regular intervals without regard
to naturally occurring cardiac activity. More commonly, however, pacemakers
sense electrical cardiac activity in one or both of the chambers of the heart, and
inhibit or trigger delivery of pacing stimuli to the heart based on the occurrence
and recognition of sensed intrinsic electrical events. A so-called "VVI"
pacemaker, for example, senses electrical cardiac activity in the ventricle of the
patient's heart, and delivers pacing stimuli to the ventricle only in the absence of
electrical signals indicative of natural ventricular contractions. A "DDD"
pacemaker, on the other hand, senses electrical signals in both the atrium and
ventricle of the patient's heart, and delivers atrial pacing stimuli in the absence
of signals indicative of natural atrial contractions, and ventricular pacing stimuli
in the absence of signals indicative of natural ventricular contractions. The
delivery of each pacing stimulus by a DDD pacemaker is synchronized with prior
sensed or paced events.Pacemakers are also known which respond to other types of
physiologically-based signals, such as signals from sensors for measuring the
pressure inside the patient's ventricle or for measuring the level of the patient's
physical activity. In recent years, pacemakers which measure the metabolic
demand for oxygen and vary the pacing rate in response thereto have become
widely available. Perhaps the most popularly employed method for measuring 
the need for oxygenated blood is to measure the physical activity of the patient
by means of a piezoelectric transducer. A piezoelectric crystal for activity sensing
is typically fixed to the pacemaker shield and generates an electrical signal in
response to deflections of the pacemaker shield caused by patient activity.
Piezoelectric, microphone-like sensors are widely used in rate-responsive
pacemakers because they are relatively inexpensive, their manufactured yield is
high, and they transduce the acoustic energy of patients' motion in a highly
reliable manner. A pacemaker
