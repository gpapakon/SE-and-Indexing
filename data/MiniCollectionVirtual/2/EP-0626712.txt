<ABSTRACT>
A coupling device between two modular 
electric apparatus (1,12) intended for juxtaposition on 

a side face (21,22), comprising a plurality of locating 
pins (26,27,28) and sockets (29,30,31) matching said 

pins, disposed on the side faces (21,22) to be 
juxtaposed of the two apparatus, a plurality of slides 

(37) set in at least one of said apparatus, slidable in 
the plane of said side faces (21,22) to be juxtaposed 

and provided with a raised hooking tooth (32,33) on

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a coupling device provided on
two modular electric apparatus according to the preamble of claim 1, so-called of
the DIN type because intended for juxtaposed
installation on a rail holder conformant with that body
of standards.As is known, modern electric systems make
ample use of modular electric apparatus, each designed
to perform a predetermined function.By suitably combining such apparatus, complex
structures can be obtained which provide the sum of the
different functions.For example, a plurality of single-pole
switch modules identical with one another may be
coupled to form a two- or three-pole switch.With the switches, which usually provide
maximum current protection (known as magnetothermal
switches), there may be associated protection devices
responsive to differential currents, signalling
devices, remote operation devices, etc..The construction of systems from modular
apparatus affords considerable apparatus production and
distribution scale savings, and fills a variety of
demands with a limited number of components, but poses
the problem of providing reliable and safe electric 
systems which be at one time simple to install, compact
and consistent, in the sense that the various apparatus
ought to have homogeneous electric, responsiveness,
capacity and voltage characteristics.In this respect, international standards have
been set which include the following provisions for
modular apparatus:The apparatus should be coupleable by means
of intrinsic elements, requiring no disposable
components like screws, nuts, and any separate
apparatus elements.The coupling should be easy to establish and
preferably require no special tools, and once the
coupling is completed, the apparatus should be
difficult, if not impossible, to separate.It should not be possible to couple apparatus
having different voltage or current ratings, or certain
apparatus (e.g. switches) should not be coupleable with
other apparatus (differential or stray current
detectors) having lower current or voltage ratings.It is obvious then that the coupling devices
between apparatus should be, as far as possible,
simple, economical to manufacture, and compact, and
should not burden the apparatus manufacturing processes
and costs. Additionally, they should be of no substantial bulk
on those faces of the apparatus which are not juxtaposed,
not to interfere with any clamp-down, electric
interconnection, actuation and/or signalling elements
already occupying such faces.Known are, for example from Italian Utility Model

<CLAIMS>
A coupling device provided on two modular
electric apparatus (1,12) to be juxtaposed and coupled

on their side faces (21,22), comprising a plurality of
locating pins (26,27,28) and matching sockets (29,30,31)

for said pins, disposed on the side faces (21,22) to be
juxtaposed of the two apparatus which provide mutual

positioning of the modular apparatus (1,12),

characterised in that said coupling device further
comprises:


a plurality of slides (37) in at least one of said
apparatus (1,12), each slide (37) being slidably received in a

recess provided on one of said side faces (21), being slidable
parallel to the plane of said one side face (21) to be

juxtaposed and being provided with a hooking tooth
(32,33) protruding from the plane of said one side face (21)

and with an actuation head (38) accessible on a face (22) of
said modular apparatus other than said one side face

(21), and
a plurality of hooking sockets (34,35) disposed on
at least one of said side faces (21,22) to be juxtaposed,

each matching one of said teeth (32,33) when said side
faces (21,22) are juxtaposed.
A coupling device as in Claim 1, wherein
said plurality of locating pins (26,27,28) and sockets 

(29,30,31) matching said pins (26,27,28) comprise two locating
pins and two matching sockets in a pair of apparatus (1,12) to

be coupled with electric characteristics of a first type
and three locating pins and three matching sockets in a

pair of apparatus to be coupled with electric
characteristics of a second type, two of said pins

having identical layouts with that of the pins and
sockets of said apparatus pair with electric

characteristics of the first type.
A coupling device as in the preceding claims

wherein said plurality of locating pins (26,27,28) and
sockets (29,30,31) matching said pins comprise pins and

sockets correlated as to number and/or shape and/or
spatial position on said side faces (21,22,) with an

electric characteristic of the electric apparatus on
which they are disposed.
A coupling device as in the preceding claims
wherein each of said slides (37) is received in a groove

present on one of said side faces (21,22), provided with at least
a pair of holding teeth (41,42) for said slide (37),

elongate in the direction of said groove, an inner
bearing diaphragm (43) of said slide (37) parallel to

said side face (21,22) and non-overlapping said holding teeth
(41,42) in a perpendicular direction to said side face (21,22)

and with an end opening provided with an inward edge 
(46) parallel to said side face and non-overlapping

said holding teeth (41,42), for the introduction of
said slide (37) into said groove between said pair of

holding teeth (41,42) on the one side and said inner
bearing diaphragm (43) and inward edge (46) on the

other.
A coupling device as in the preceding claims
wherein each said slide (37) is provided with a retainer tooth

(40) for preventing said slide (37) from coming off said
groove.
A coupling device as in Claim 5, wherein said
retainer tooth (40) co-operates with said inward edge

(46) to prevent said slide (37) from coming off said groove.
