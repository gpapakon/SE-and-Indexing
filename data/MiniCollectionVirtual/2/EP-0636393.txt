<ABSTRACT>
This method consists in marking turfed sports pitches by laying down the strands of the lawn (blades of grass) in certain zones and in raising it (them) up in other zones, so as to form an image and/or a word. The difference in orientation of the strands of the lawn is highly visible to the spectator. The strands are laid down by means of an apparatus mounted on rollers (3) and which rolls over the lawn surface. The same apparatus is provided with brushes (2) which rotate and which stand the strands of lawn up over certain defined sectors (13). The sectors form an image or the letters of a word. The motors (11) which control the path of the apparatus and the brushes (2) are electric and are controlled by a computer, the image to be reproduced and the position of the apparatus on the surface to be treated being stored in the computer.

Method for marking grass fields, particularly sports fields,
in which one part of the blades on a grass surface is oriented

in one direction and at least one other part of the blades on
the said grass surface is oriented or is left oriented in at

least one other direction, in such a way that at least one of
the parts constitute one or more images or signs,

characterized in that at least one model of the image or sign
to be marked on the grass surface is entered in a computer,

in that said model is divided into several points, in that the
grass surface is divided in several sectors (13), moreover in

that the instantaneous position of grass blade orienting
means (2, 3) is entered in the computer, and in that the

action of said means (2, 3) is controlled in relation to the
position of said means on given sectors (13) which

correspond to given points of the model or sign to be
marked on the grass surface.
Method according to claim 1, characterized in that the blades
of grass on at least one part of the grass surface are oriented

by means of one or several brushes (2).
Method according to claim 2, characterized in that rotating
brushes (2) are used.
Method according to claim 1, characterized in that the blades
of grass on at least one part of the grass surface are oriented

by means of one or more rollers (3).
Method according to claim 1, characterized in that the blades
of grass on at least one part of the grass surface are oriented

by means of one or more brushes (2) and by one or more
rollers (3).
Method according to one of claims 1 to 5, characterized in
that the action of the grass blade directing means (2, 3) is

controlled by the computer in which are programmed the 
model or models of signs or images to be marked on the

grass surface, divided into points, the instantaneous position
of said means on the grass surface, and commands

controlling the said action for each sector depending on the
corresponding point of the model and the said position of

the said means.
Method according to claim 6, characterized in that an
apparatus is used on to which are fixed the grass blades

orienting means (2, 3), and in that the position of the said
apparatus on the grass surface is registered by sensors

which detect the presence of magnetizable bodies which are
placed or burried at give places on or under the said surface.
Method according to claim 7, characterized in that an
apparatus is used on which are fixed the grass blade

orienting means (2,3) and in that the position of the said
apparatus on the grass surface is registered by a device

which is at least able to receive electromagnetic or sonic
waves.
Method according to claim 8, characterized in that the device
receives signals from geostationary satellites.
Apparatus for marking grass fields comprising wheels (1)
enabling it to move, brushes (2) and/or rollers (3), and

means for selectively lowering some of the said brushes (2)
and/or rollers (3) onto the grass and raising them so that

they no longer touch the grass .
Apparatus for marking grass fields, comprising wheels (1)
enabling it to move, rotating brushes (2) and means for

rotating the brushes in both directions.
Apparatus according to claim 11, characterized in that it
comprises means for lowering at least some of the said

brushes onto the grass and for raising them so that they no
longer touch the grass. 
Apparatus according to claim 12, characterized in that at
least some brushes (2) and/or rollers (3) are assembled in

groups (15).
Apparatus according to claim 13, characterized in that the
grouped rollers (3) are mounted on at least one rotating

barrel (15) in such a way as to be able to rotate freely.
Apparatus according to one of the claims 10 to 14,
characterized in that the brushes (2) and/or rollers (3)

and/or the groups (15) of brushes and/or rollers are
positioned in staggered rows.
Apparatus according to one of the claims 10 to 15,
characterized in that it comprises the means for raising the

wheels (1), and rollers (3) for supporting and moving the
apparatus when the wheels are raised.
Apparatus according to claim 16, characterized in that it
comprises at least one motor (11) activating the rollers (3)

which support the apparatus and a steering device for
guiding the apparatus when the wheels (1) are raised.
Apparatus according to one of the claims 10 to 17,
characterized in that each roller (3) or group (15) of rollers

and each brush (2) or group (15) of brushes is controlled by
a different motor (11).
Apparatus according to one of the claims 10 to 18,
characterized in that the position of the apparatus on the

grass surface is determined by a counter [odometer]
activated by the rollers (3) supporting the apparatus or by a

wheel which rolls on the said grass surface.
Apparatus according to one of the claims 16 to 19,
characterized in that the (1) axes of rotation of the wheels

are perpendicular to the axes of rotation of the rollers (3)
and/or the brushes (2) when the steering device is in

neutral position. 
Apparatus according to one of the claims 10 to 20,
characterized in that it comprises a computer in which is

entered the model of the image or sign to be marked on the
grass, means for determining the position of the apparatus

on the grass surface and means for allowing at least some
brushes (2) and/or some rollers (3) and/or groups (15) of

rollers to be lowered or raised and/or rotated in such a way
as to direct one part of the blades on the grass surface in a

direction different from that of the other blades of grass, so

that at least one of the parts of the grass surface constitutes
at least one image or one sign corresponding to that which is

programmed in the computer.
