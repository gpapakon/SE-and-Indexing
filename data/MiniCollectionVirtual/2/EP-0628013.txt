<ABSTRACT>
A winding bobbin (50) for receiving elongated winding material, in particular metal-containing winding material, has a winding core (52) preferably made of plastics upon which are arranged two flanges (53, 54). At least one flange (53) is removable. Joining means are provided for locking the flange (53) on the winding core, ensuring a stable connection between the flange (53) and the winding core (52) in the axial direction. Preferably a locking element (86) prevents the removable flange (53) from being unintentionally loosened from the winding core (52).

<CLAIMS>
Winding bobbin for receiving elongated winding material
and in particular winding material which contains metal, such as

wire, stranded wire, stranded wire covered with synthetic
material etc., with a winding core, which is designed to be

essentially rotationally symmetrical with respect to an axis of
rotation and which comprises a first end, on which an annular

plate (53) is located, a second end located opposite the first
end and provided with a flange (55), connecting means, which are

provided at least between the first end of the winding core and
this annular plate, in order to connect the annular plate and the

winding core detachably to each other, in which case provided at
the first end of the winding core (52) are locking projections

(64) spaced apart and projecting inwards, which in the assembled
state cooperate with correspondingly shaped retaining projections

(79) on the annular plate (53), so that the annular plate and the
winding core are held relative to each other in the axial

direction, i.e. in the longitudinal direction of the axis of
rotation (56) of the winding bobbin (50), characterised in that

this annular plate is constructed as a first flange (53), which
can be removed for the transportation of the empty bobbin, that

a locking member (86) consisting of synthetic material or metal
is provided, which is guided in the removable flange and which

in the assembled state of the removable flange engages between
these projections and prevents a relative movement between the

winding core and removable flange, so that the removable flange
is secured axially and radially with respect to the winding core.
Winding bobbin according to Claim 1, characterised in that
the second flange is securely connected to this second end of the

winding core.
Winding bobbin according to Claim 1, characterised in that
the connecting means are also located between the second end of

the winding core and the second flange, so that the second flange
is also detachably connected to the winding core. 
Winding bobbin according to Claims 1 to 3, characterised
in that, seen in the peripheral direction of the removable flange

(53), the retaining projections (79) have a spacing from each
other which is greater than the length of these locking

projections (64) and that retaining projections (79) and locking
projections (64) are brought into engagement with each other so

that the winding core (52) with the locking projections is first
of all placed between these retaining projections and that then

the flange and winding core are rotated through a predetermined
angle with respect to each other, so that these retaining

projections and these locking projections come into engagement
with each other.
Winding bobbin according to Claim 4, characterised in that
provided on each removable flange is at least one locking member

(86), which engages in the gap between these retaining
projections (79) and prevents a relative movement of the winding

core (52) and removable flange (53), when the retaining
projections (79) and the locking projections (64) are in

engagement with each other.
Winding bobbin according to Claim 5, characterised in that
this locking member (86) is constructed as an elastically

deformable member, which is held in the removable flange and
which at the time of fitting-together of the winding core (52)

and flange (53) is elastically deformable from outside by means
of a tool or by hand so that in the deformed state it releases

the gap between these retaining projections, so that a rotary
movement between the winding core and this removable flange is

possible and that after this deformation it returns to its
initial position, in which a rotary movement between the winding

core and removable flange is prevented.
Winding bobbin according to one of Claims 1 to 6,
characterised in that the locking member comprises a thickened

portion (93), which is designed so that the locking member does
not come into a position in which the rotation of the winding 

core is released, when the winding bobbin (50) with the removable
flange (53) stands on a flat surface or a correspondingly shaped

surface.
Winding bobbin according to at least one of Claims 1 to

5, characterised in that each removable flange (3; 53) comprises
a flange surface (26; 66) essentially in the shape of a circular

disc and facing the winding core and that, strengthening ribs
extending in the peripheral direction and in the radial direction

are provided on the side of this disc-shaped part remote from the
winding core.
Winding bobbin according to Claim 2, characterised in that
strengthening ribs extending in the peripheral direction and in

the radial direction are provided on the fixed flange.
Winding bobbin according to Claim 8 or 9, characterised
in that the strengthening ribs on each flange are designed so

that when several mounted and possibly filled bobbins are stacked
one above the other, the strengthening ribs of the first and

second flange engage one in the other so that a form-locking
connection is created, which prevents slipping of the flanges

relative to each other.
Winding bobbin according to at least one of Claims 1 to
10, characterised in that the winding core has a cylindrical

construction.
Winding bobbin according to at least one of Claims 1 to
10, characterised in that the winding core has a conical

construction.
Winding bobbin according to Claim 11 or 12, characterised
in that the winding core can be divided in a plane which includes

the axis of rotation of the winding core.
Winding bobbin according to Claim 13, characterised in 
that provided inside the winding core are inwardly projecting

strengthening ribs extending in the longitudinal direction or in
the peripheral direction.
Winding bobbin according to at least one of Claims 13 or
14, characterised in that locking means are provided, which cause

locking of the individual parts of the winding core one with the
other.
Winding bobbin according to at least one of Claims 1 to
15, characterised in that the winding core (2; 52) and each

flange consists of synthetic material.
Winding bobbin according to at least one of Claims 1 to
16, characterised in that this locking member (86) comprises an

elongated plate (87).
Winding bobbin according to Claim 17, characterised in
that this plate is held in the flange in a position which is

essentially parallel to the surface of the removable flange (53)
facing the winding material.
Winding bobbin according to at least one Claims 1 to 18,
characterised in that provided in the removable flange (53) is

an essentially annular recess (75), in which a retaining
structure with these retaining projections (79) is located.
