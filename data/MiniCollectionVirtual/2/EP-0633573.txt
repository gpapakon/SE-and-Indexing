<ABSTRACT>
A videocassette-cover case having a box-shape is used for stowing a 
videocassette or a box-shaped rental case in which the videocassette is to be 

put. The cover case comprises a top section, two wider-side sections, two 
narrower-side sections, and a bottom section. At least the top section which 

can be opened in such a manner to get in and out the rental case and at least 
one of said side sections has a projecting stopper on an inside thereof. A 

projection size of the stopper is designed in such a manner that a bottom of 
the rental case touches the stopper so that an upper portion of the rental 

case projects above an upper surface of the cover case by a required amount 
when the rental case is inserted into the cover case through the open top 

section and in such a manner that the stopper does not prevent the 
videocassette from being stowed in the cover case so that the videocassette 

can be completely stowed in the cover case.

<DESCRIPTION>
In a videocassette-rental shop, a videocassette 10 is stowed in a 
transparent or a semi-transparent box-shaped rental case 11 with one broader 
side openable, the rental case 11 is put in a display case 12, and the display 
case 12 is displayed, as illustrated in Fig. 10. The display case 12 of such a type has an opening 12a on an upper surface 
thereof, an projection 12b along the opening 12a, and stoppers 12d inside the 
both broader sides thereof, said projection 12b having a display seal 12c of 
OUT. According to such a construction, when the rental case 11 in which the 
video cassette 10 is stowed is inserted into the display case 12 through the 
opening 12a, a bottom of the rental case 11 touches the stoppers 12d, which 
prevent further entrance of the rental case 11 into the display case 12, so 
that an upper portion of the rental case 11 projects above the opening 12a by 
a determined size, thereby covering the seal 12c. While a desired videocassette 10 is being rented, the seal 12c on which 
OUT is marked appears. Thus, customers can know at a glance whether or not a 
desired videocassette 10 is being rented.  Normally, a videocassette 10 on sale is stowed in a box-shaped cover case 
with one broader side openable, said cover case having the same construction 
with that of the rental case 11. A cover case of this kind is normally opaque. 
Thus, it is impossible to know at a glance whether or not a videocassette 10 is 
put in the cover case. For this reason, a videocassette-rental shop uses a transparent or a 
semi-transparent rental case 11 to contain a videocassette 10. In a 
videocassette-rental shop,to display a videocassette 10, with a videocassette 
10 put in the rental case 11, the renal case 11 is put in a display case 12. A videocassette-rental shop needs a transparent or semi-transparent rental 
case 11 and a display case 12 for containing the rental case 11 to display a 
videocassette 10. Further, a cover case attached to a videocassette 10 on 
sale is not needed. This results in an uneconomical usage of the rental case 
11 and the display case 12. It is, accordingly, a primary object of th present invention to provide a 
videocassette-cover case which is available for a display case in a 
videocassette-rental shop. To attain the above object, there is provided in the invention the  
 
videocassette-cover case having a box-shape for stowing a videocassette or a 
box-shaped rental case in which the videocassette is to be put, said cover 
case comprising a top section, two wider-side
