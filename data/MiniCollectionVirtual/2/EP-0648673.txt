<ABSTRACT>
A device for producing, filling and sealing bags (35) consisting of a tube (16) has a forming pipe (12) and a movable inner pipe (19) with a mouthpiece (20) which is connected thereto and adjacently to the bottom (21) of which a block bottom for a bag (35) is folded. The mouthpiece (20) is moved by means of a clamping device (36) at the conveying speed of the tube (16) and parallel to the latter. The clamping device (36) is arranged on a transverse-seam jaw housing (27) which is itself movable along the conveying path of the tube (16). By means of the device according to the invention and the method which can be put into practice with this, block bottoms can be folded in bags (35) during a continuous conveyance of the tube (16), thereby resulting in a particularly high output of the device.

Method of producing, filling and closing bags
(35), in which method an endless plastic-film web (14) is

formed, by means of a flexible-tube-forming device (10)
and a longitudinal-seam-sealing device (13), into a

flexible tube (16) which is conveyed by at least one
take-off device (18), it being the case that, as conveying

continues, bags (35) are formed, and severed, from
the flexible tube (16) by a cutting device connected to

a transverse-seam sealing device (32), characterized in
that the flexible tube (16) is conveyed continuously, in

that, over a specific region of the conveying path of the
flexible tube (16), a mouthpiece (20), which can be moved

up and down, is moved at the same speed as the flexible
tube (16), inside and parallel to the latter, in that,

over this specific region of the conveying path, a block
base is folded by means of a folding device (30), from an

overhang of the flexible tube (16), next to a base (21)
of the mouthpiece (20), the folding device (30), along

with the transverse-seam-sealing device (32) connected to
it, being moved at the same speed as the flexible tube

(16), and in that the mouthpiece (20) is then moved back
into an original, raised position, while a filling is

introduced into the flexible tube (16) thus formed.
Apparatus for producing, filling and closing bags
(35), having a flexible-tube-forming device (10), comprising

a forming shoulder (11) and a forming tube (12)
for forming a flexible tube (16) from an endless plastic-film

web (14), having a longitudinal-seam-sealing device
(13), having at least one take-off device (18) for the 

flexible tube (16) formed, having a transverse-seam-sealing
device (32), and having a folding device (30) for

forming a block base at one end of the flexible tube (16)
in each case, characterized in that an inner tube (19),

which can be moved up and down and has a mouthpiece (20)
connected to it, is arranged on the flexible-tube-forming

device (10), the shape of the mouthpiece (20) being
adapted, at one end, to the forming tube (12) and, at its

other end, to the block base which is to be folded, in
that, in the region of its base (21), the mouthpiece (20)

has an opening (22) for the filling, in that the mouthpiece
(20) is assigned a device (36) which, over a

specific region of the conveying path of the flexible
tube (16) moves said mouthpiece along in the conveying

direction of the flexible tube, synchronously with the
speed of the latter, in that the folding device (30) is

connected fixedly to the transverse-seam-sealing device
(32), and in that the folding device (30) and the transverse-seam-sealing

device (32) can be moved up and down
along the conveying path of the flexible tube (16).
Apparatus according to Claim 2, characterized in
that, in the region where it emerges (17) from the

forming tube (12), the mouthpiece (20) is enclosed by the
forming tube in a virtually positively locking manner.
Apparatus according to Claim 2 or 3, characterized
in that the device for moving the mouthpiece (20)

comprises at least two clamping devices (36) which are
connected fixedly, on both sides of the mouthpiece (20),

to the transverse-seam-sealing device (32), and in that
the clamping devices (36) have retaining jaws (37) which

can be moved transversely with respect to the conveying
direction of the flexible tube (16) and of which the end

faces (38) are adapted in a positively locking manner to
the shape of the mouthpiece (20).
Apparatus according to one of Claims 2 to 4,
characterized in that the inner tube (19) is connected,

via a linkage (23), to an actuating cylinder (25) for the
purpose of raising the inner tube (19) in the forming

tube (12).
