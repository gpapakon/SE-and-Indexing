<ABSTRACT>
Precise information is obtainable concerning the 
position of a fluid-fluid interface (28, 33), such as between 

a gas and a liquid or between liquids. Such information is 
important for the control and automation of molten metal 

refining processes. Specifically, in an electrolytic process 
for removing magnesium from molten aluminum, knowledge of the 

vertical position of an interface (33) between the electrolyte 
and the magnesium and an interface (28) between the 

electrolyte and the aluminum facilitates the automatic removal 
of the purified metals when drained or drawn from the furnace. 

Heat energy is conducted through a thermocouple-heater 
assembly 34 to a thermocouple (38) located at its tip (36). 

The equilibrium temperature at the thermocouple junction is 
dependent upon the heat loss through tip (36). When the tip 

comes in contact with a fluid of different thermal conductivity, 
as between molten matter (29) and electrolyte (30), 

the equilibrium temperature at tip (36) and, thus, of the 
thermocouple junction will change. This change in temperature 

is used to determine the level of the liquid-liquid interface 
between molten matter (29) and electrolyte (30). This 

information is used to determine when the drawing of further 
molten material from the furnace is to be terminated, so that 

aluminum purified in the refining process and previously drawn 
through an outlet (26) will not be contaminated.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method and 
apparatus for detecting the position of fluid-fluid 
interfaces, e.g., between liquid-liquid and gas-liquid 
interfaces, and, more particularly, to the effecting of such 
a method and apparatus by use of thermal detection means. The 
present invention is suitable for use in the refining of 
molten metals with specific application to the removal of 
magnesium from scrap aluminum. Although the impetus for conceiving the present 
invention is to provide process control in molten metal 
technologies, specifically, in a process for refining scrap 
aluminum, it is to be understood that the present invention 
is as applicable to any need for detecting the position of 
fluid-fluid interfaces by thermal detection means. The removal of magnesium from scrap aluminum has 
been discussed in several publications, of which the following 
two are of particular interest to the present invention, viz., 
"Electrolytic Removal of Magnesium from Scrap Aluminum" 
JOURNAL OF METALS, Vol. 36, No. 7, July, 1984 pp. 141-43, and 
"Electrolytic Demagging of Secondary Aluminum in a Prototype 
Furnace" AFS Transactions, Vol. 94, pp. 385-390 (1986). The 
following excerpt from the latter article well states the 
reasons and background for recovering aluminum from scrap. "The amount of aluminum in an automobile has 
steadily increased from an average of 40 kg in 1976 to an 
average of 60 kg in 1982 due to efforts to achieve higher fuel 
efficiency by lowering the overall weight of the vehicle. 
Therefore, for a constant supply of aluminum at minimum cost, 
casting producers may consider increasing the use of high  
 
magnesium scrap, with large potential savings over the 
purchase of primary aluminum. However, to conform with 
specifications, the production of casting alloys such as 319 
from high magnesium aluminum scrap would require the removal 
of magnesium in excess of 0.1 wt.%. A chlorination process 
is most widely used by secondary smelters for demagging 
casting alloys. In this process, magnesium is selectively 
oxidized by chlorine and removed from molten aluminum in the 
form of a magnesium chloride dross. While the process is 
reasonably efficient at high magnesium content, it may create 
unacceptable environmental conditions in the plant. In 
addition, magnesium is being lost in the form of MgClâ‚‚ dross, 
which being hygroscopic may pose disposal problems. "Recognizing the need for an efficient and 
pollution-free demagging process, we have been developing the 
electrochemical
