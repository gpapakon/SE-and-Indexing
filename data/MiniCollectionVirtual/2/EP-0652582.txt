<ABSTRACT>
The present invention is direct to a cathode-ray tube having arc suppressing 
means therein. An electron gun mount assembly comprises the cathode electrode 

(3) to emit thermions, a control grid electrode to adjust the amount of the 
thermions emitted from the cathode electrode and to form the beam of 

electrons, a focusing electrode to focus the beam of electrons formed in the 
control grid electrode, and an accelerating electrode to accelerate the beam 

of electrons focused in the electrode. To remove the thermions leaking from 
the cathode electrode a metal piece (12) is positioned between any one of 

the metal wires located horizontally farthest away from the cathode electrode 
(3) and an inner wall of a neck glass (11), with one end of the metal piece 

being electrically connected to an extra stem pin grounded at any one of 
ground terminals outside the cathode-ray tube.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a cathode-ray tube having arc 
suppressing means therein, more particularly to a cathode-ray 
tube having arc suppressing means to make thermions leaking from 
a cathode electrode of an electron gun mount assembly flow out 
of a cathode ray tube by positioning a metal piece to an extra 
stem pin, thereby using the extra stem pin for grounding. Generally, a cathode-ray tube comprises a neck 
accommodating an electron gun mount assembly and a deflection 
plate assembly, and a viewing window having a fluorescent viewing 
screen. The electron gun mount assembly comprises the cathode 
electrode to emit thermions; a control grid electrode to adjust 
the amount of the emitted thermions and form the beam of 
electrons; a focusing electrode to focus the beam of electrons 
formed in the control grid electrode; and an accelerating 
electrode to accelerate the beam of electrons. The electron gun 
mount assembly is enveloped by a neck glass. Most of the 
thermions emitted from the cathode electrode reach the viewing 
screen passing through the control grid electrode, the focusing 
electrode and the accelerating electrode. However, a few of the  
 
thermions emitted from the cathode electrode leak toward the neck 
glass. The leaked thermions collide with the neck glass and 
generate secondary electrons, thereby causing the avalanches. 
The charged electrons due to the avalanches are moved toward the 
accelerating electrode in high voltage, thereby causing arcing 
phenomena. To suppress such arcing,an inner wall of the neck glass have 
been coated, or a metal ring has been mounted to surround the 
accelerating electrode. However, the formed prevents only a part 
of the arcing, while the inner coating is burned by the arcing. 
The latter also partially reduce the arcing around the metal 
ring. That is, the prior art of the inner wall coating or the 
metal ring mounting is only partially effective in preventing 
arcing, but cannot eliminate the avalanches that cause the 
arcing. Therefore, the object of the present invention is to provide 
the cathode-ray tube having arc suppressing means by positioning 
a metal piece between the inner wall of the neck glass and the 
electron gun mount assembly and connecting the metal piece to an 
extra stem pin so that the leaked thermions from the cathode 
electrode flow through the metal piece and the stem pin, and be 
released out of the cathode-ray tube. The above function is only of the various, useful features 
of the invention. The invention can
