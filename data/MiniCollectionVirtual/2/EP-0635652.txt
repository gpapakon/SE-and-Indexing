<ABSTRACT>
A clutch diaphragm spring includes a peripheral part (31) 
adapted to be attached to a clutch cover for pressing a 

pressure plate, and a plurality of leg parts (32,33,34) adapted to abut a 
clutch release bearing. The plurality of leg parts (32,33,34) extend 

radially from the peripheral part (31) towards an axial center 
thereof, and have such configurations as to make resonance 

frequencies of adjacent leg parts different from each other, 
thereby preventing vibrations generated in any one of the 

plurality of leg parts from being transmitted to the other leg 
parts in the amplified state.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a clutch diaphragm
spring.One example of a conventional clutch diaphragm spring is
disclosed in Japanese Utility Model application laid-open No.
Sho 62-140226. This spring is attached to a clutch cover so as
to press a pressure plate and abut a clutch release bearing.
This spring has a peripheral part adapted to be attached to the
clutch cover and a plurality of leg parts extending radially
from the peripheral part toward a center thereof. The
peripheral part presses the pressure plate while the plurality
of leg parts abut the clutch release bearing. And vibration-damping
members are respectively secured to the leg parts. The
vibrations of the leg parts caused by drag friction between the
clutch diaphragm spring and the clutch release bearing have
been conventionally damped by these vibration-damping members.The above-described conventional clutch diaphragm spring,
however, has the defects that the production costs become 
expensive due to the addition of the vibration-damping
members, and also there is a limit to the vibration-damping
ability thereof. As a result, vibrations undamped by the
vibration-damping members resonate with adjacent leg parts to
generate loud noises.A clutch diaphragm spring according to the preamble of claims
1 and 2 is known from US 4 126 216. This spring may be
attached to a clutch cover for pressing a pressure plate of
the clutch and abutting against a clutch release bearing. A
peripheral part of this spring is adapted for pressing the
pressure plate and further a plurality of leg parts are
provided which are adapted to abut against the clutch release
bearing, wherein these leg parts extend radially from the
peripheral part towards an axial center thereof. According to
one embodiment, there are provided leg parts having different
configurations which show different resonance frequencies.Accordingly, it is an object of the present invention to
provide a clutch diaphragm spring easy to manufacture by
which vibrations generated in leg parts are prevented from
resonating with their adjacent leg parts. This object is
solved by the features of claims 1 and 2.The clutch diaphragm spring in accordance with the present
invention has leg parts of such configurations as to make
resonance frequencies thereof different from each other. Such
configurations are realized by partially cutting away one
kind of leg parts to make the mass thereof different from
that of another kind of leg parts adjacent to one kind of leg
parts, or by partially cutting away root
