<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a pressure and heart movement
sensor for a heart stimulator, comprising an electrode
system for implantation with an electrode cable containing
at least one conductor leading to one electrode pole, or
alternately at least two contuctors leading to electrode
poles.For arrhythmia-treating implants, such as heart stimulators,
pressure sensors for controlling the stimulator are ideal
sensors in many respects. With a pressure sensor,
hemodynamics can be measured in both tachyarrhythmias and
bradyarrhythmias. Heart contractions can be sensed and used
for autocapture and atrial synchronization. Furthermore, the
time derivative dP/dt is a good rate-response parameter.For the applications in question, prior art pressure sensors
normally contain a piezoelectric or piezoresistive pressure
element. A pacemaker controlled with this type of sensor is
previously known from e.g. US-A-4,140,132. One disadvantage
of this type of sensor is that the sensor requires
additional electrical lines, normally two. The electrode
cable must therefore contain relatively many conductors.
Another disadvantage of this design is that special
impedance demands must often be made on the pressure element
in order e.g. to eliminate the problem of leakage
resistances, making it necessary to place electric
components out near the sensor itself. Another disadvantage
is the fact that the piezoelectric ceramic material itself
is hard and brittle.Capacitive accelerometers are also previously known, cf.
DE-A1-3 223 987 in which an inertial mass forms one of the 
capacitor plates so the capacitance changes when the plate
is subjected to acceleration. However, this technic cannot
be used for implantable pressure and heart movement sensors
of the kind involved here. Such a sensor would also require
additional conductors.The existence of a capacitive coupling between electrical
conductors and between a conductor and ambient medium is
well-known, cf.e.g. Tietze and Schenk, Halbleiter-Schaltungstechnik,
Springer-Verlag, Berlin Heidelberg New
York 1978, 4th edition, page 647. The magnitude of the
capacitive coupling depends a.o. on the dielectric constant
of the materials between the conductors and the distance
between them.Such a capacitive coupling is naturally found even between
the conductors in a bipolar pacemaker electrode system and
between the conductors and ambient electrolyte, i.e. blood.
A capacitance of about 100 pF has been measured between the
two conductors in a bipolar pacemaker electrode system in
dry
