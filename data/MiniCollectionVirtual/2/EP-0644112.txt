<ABSTRACT>
Propulsion unit for watercraft propulsion independent of outside air, in particular for propulsion of a submarine, having an internal combustion engine. The internal combustion engine (1) works in a closed circuit in a manner known per se. During low-load operation of the internal combustion engine, the exhaust gas is directed in a manner known per se via an absorption unit (2) in which the CO2 contained in the exhaust gas is dissolved in sea water and is disposed of outside (19) the vessel, whereas during full-load operation of the internal combustion engine (1) the CO2 accumulating in the exhaust gas is liquefied in a liquefying unit (3) and put into interim storage in an accumulator (4). During low-load operation of the internal combustion engine, the CO2 held in interim storage in the accumulator (4) is absorbed via the absorption unit (2) and disposed of outside the vessel.

A drive device for a drive, independent of the outside air, 
of a water craft, in particular an underwater craft, having an 

internal combustion engine (1), preferably a diesel engine, 
operating in a closed cycle, where the water arising from the 

combustion process and CO
2
 are disposed of and the exhaust gas is 
enriched with oxygen (10) and supplied to the internal combustion 

engine again as operating gas (21), characterized in that in low 
load operation of the internal combustion engine (1) the exhaust 

gas (20) is directed in a manner known per se by way of an 
absorption unit (2) in which the CO
2
 present in the exhaust gas 
is dissolved in sea water (18) and disposed of outboard (19); in 

that in full load operation of the internal combustion engine (1) 
the CO
2
 arising in the exhaust gas (20) is liquified in a 
liquifying unit (3) in a manner known per se and stored 

temporarily in an accumulator (4); in that the performance of the 
absorption unit (2) is designed to be higher than for low load 

operation but lower than for full load operation; and in that in 
low load operation of the internal combustion engine (1) the 

liquified CO
2
 stored temporarily in the accumulator (4) is 
dissolved in sea water by way of the absorption unit (2) and 

disposed of outboard (19). 
A drive device according to Claim 1, characterized in that 
the absorption unit (2) is an absorber having a rotating filter 

drum. 
A drive device according to Claim 1 or 2, characterized in 
that the liquifying unit (3) for the CO
2
 contains compressors (5) 
and intermediate cooling means (6) cooled by sea water. 
A drive device according to Claim 3, characterized in that 
an additional cooling takes place in the liquifying unit (3) for 

the CO
2
 by means of a refrigerating machine.  
 
A drive device according to Claim 3, in which the oxygen for 
the operating gas is carried in liquid form, characterized in 

that an additional cooling takes place in the liquifying unit (3) 
for the CO
2
 by gasifying the liquid oxygen. 
A drive device according to one of the preceding claims, 
characterized in that the exhaust gas (20) from the internal 

combustion engine (1) is directed by way of an exhaust-gas 
cooling means (7) and a water separator (8) before it reaches the 

absorption unit (2) or the liquifying unit (3). 
A drive device according to one of the preceding claims, 
characterized in that combustion air (21) for the internal 

combustion engine (1) contains a noble gas (9), for example 
argon, as inert gas. 
A drive device according to one of the preceding claims, 
characterized in that in surface or snorkel operation the 

internal combustion engine (1) is operated by outside air and the 
exhaust gas (20) is disposed of directly to the outside.
