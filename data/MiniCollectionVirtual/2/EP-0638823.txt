<ABSTRACT>
An ultrasonic stand-off gauge for use in measuring 
the instantaneous stand-off distance between the drill 

stem and the borehole wall (24) while drilling. A 
primary transducer (40) mounted on the drill collar (26) 

sends and receives ultrasonic pulses (34,38) between the 
drill collar and the borehole wall. A second, reference 

transducer (46) mounted on the pressure barrel (44) 
within the drill collar measures the sound speed of the 

drilling fluid (36). The drilling fluid flows through a 
conduit (28) within the drill collar, where the 

reference transducer transmits a pulse (52) through the 
drilling fluid in the conduit. The pulse from the 

reference transducer is reflected off an internal 
reflector (50) mounted on the internal surface of the 

drill collar. Since the distance between the reference 
transducer and the reflector is known and constant, the 

sound speed of the drilling fluid is determined 
accurately. Electronic circuitry (42,48,60) uses the 

sound speed measurement of the drilling fluid as 
determined by the reference transducer to calculate 

accurate values of stand-off distance. The electronic 
circuitry also compensates for the variations of 

pressure, temperature and other characteristics of the 
drilling fluid, as well as for variances in the stand-off 

distance.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an ultrasonic
stand-off gauge for use in measuring the instantaneous
stand-off between the drill stem and the borehole wall
while drilling subterranean oil and gas wells.Apparatus for measuring the inner diameter of a
borehole is known in the art, where a borehole is a
well bore drilled in the ground. One such apparatus is
a mechanical caliper, which measures the diameter of
the borehole by extending a plurality of mechanical
arms or members until the members contact the inner
surface of the borehole. The mechanical caliper
traverses the borehole to provide the desired
information regarding borehole diameter with respect to
depth. An example of a mechanical caliper is disclosed
in U.S. Patent No. 4,876,672 to Petermann, et al.Mechanical borehole calipers have several well
known disadvantages and deficiencies. One such
disadvantage relates to the steel casing utilized in a
borehole to support the upper levels of the borehole.
Actuation of the caliper arms against the side of the
steel casing will often result in scratching and other
damage to the casing. Still another disadvantage of
such mechanical calipers are their relatively complex
construction and the fact that they are not part of the
drilling apparatus. Because the caliper is a separate
probe, the drilling operations must cease when
measurements are taken. In addition, mechanical
calipers require a large number of measurements in
order to sufficiently define or map the borehole
diameter.Acoustic type caliper devices are also well known
and overcome many of the problems and disadvantages of
mechanical calipers. An example of an acoustic type 
caliper device is disclosed in U.S. Patent No.
4,827,457 to Seeman et al. The Seeman apparatus
comprises a plurality of piezoelectric type transducers
mounted on a sonde. A sonde is a wireline device
lowered into the borehole after drilling operations
have ceased. Each transducer transmits a pulse through
borehole fluid in the borehole towards the borehole
wall. The borehole fluid may also be referenced to as
drilling fluid or mud, which is the medium through
which the acoustic waves travel. The acoustic pulses
are then reflected by the borehole wall and return
through the drilling fluid back to the sonde, where
they are detected by the transducer from which they
were generated, or by another transducer dedicated to
the receiving of such pulses. The elapsed time between
the transmission and reception of each pulse, otherwise
referred to as the rouna-trip transit time (RTT),
