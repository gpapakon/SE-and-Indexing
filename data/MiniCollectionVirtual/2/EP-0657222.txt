<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to an injector nozzle for generating air-filled liquid drops, with a metering-nozzle element (2), with a mixing chamber (5), following the latter and provided with an air-suction orifice, for generating a liquid/air mixture, and with an outlet element (7). A particularly high uniformity and largely fluctuation-free distribution characteristic of the liquid drops is achieved in that there is provided between the mixing chamber (5) and the outlet element (7) a homogenising and calming space (13), the inlet cross-section of which is enlarged abruptly relative to the outlet cross-section of the mixing chamber (5).

Injector nozzle for producing air-filled drops of fluid,
comprising


a) a dosaging nozzle element (2, 2') for producing a jet of
fluid,
b) a nozzle body (3) With a chamber (5) which follows the
dosaging nozzle element in the flow direction (4) of the

jet of fluid and has opening into its widened rear end
(5b) an air intake opening (6) for producing a fluid/air

mixture, the said chamber being constructed in the
manner of a Venturi system,
c) as well as an out let element (7) provided with at least
one outlet nozzle (8) for the fluid/air mixture,
d) wherein between the mixing chamber (5) and the outlet
element (7) there is provided a hollow space (13, 13'

...) which widens abruptly relative to the outlet cross-section
(5a) of the chamber,

characterised in that
e) the chamber constructed as a mixing chamber (5) widens
conically in the direction of the hollow space (13, 13',

...) and this hollow space forms a homogenising and
stabilising chamber (13, 13', 13'') with the effect of a

pulsation damper.
Injector nozzle as claimed in Claim 1, characterised in
that the inlet cross-section (13a) of the homogenising and

stabilising chamber (13) is approximately 1.5 to 9 times,
preferably 3 to 5 times the outlet cross-section (5a) of the

mixing chamber (5). 
Injector nozzle as claimed in Claim 1, characterised in
that the homogenizing and stabilising chamber (13, 13', 13'')

has an overall length (L) which is greater than the length of
the mixing chamber (5).
Injector nozzle as claimed in Claim 1, characterized in
that the homogenising and stabilizing chamber (13, 13', 13'')

has a rear region (13b, 13') which forms an annular space
enclosing the component (3a) which forms the mixing chamber

(5).
Injector nozzle as claimed in Claim 1, characterized in
that the homogenising and stabilizing chamber (13') has at

least one region (13'a) which has a greater diameter than the
remaining regions of the homogenising and stabilizing chamber.
Injector nozzle as claimed in Claim 1, characterized in
that between the mixing chamber (5) and the outlet element (7)

there is provided a perforated element preferably formed by a
wire mesh (16) or a punched plate (15).
Injector nozzle as claimed in one of the preceding
claims, characterized in that the outlet element (7) is replaceable.
Injector nozzle as claimed in Claim 7, characterized in
that the outlet element (7) is fixed by means of a rapid

closure system, preferably a bayonet closure (9).
Injector nozzle as claimed in one of the preceding
claims, characterized in that the dosaging nozzle element (2,

2') is replaceable.
Injector nozzle as claimed in one of the preceding
claims, characterized in that the dosaging nozzle element (2)

is constructed so as to be self-centring. 
Injector nozzle as claimed in one of the preceding
claims, characterised in that the outlet element (7'') has

several outlet orifices (8'').
Injector nozzle as claimed in one of the preceding
claims, characterised in that the outlet orifice (8') of the

outlet element (7') has a cross-section which is adjustable as
regards shape and size.
Injector nozzle as claimed in one of the preceding
claims, characterised in that the air intake opening (6) of

the mixing chamber (5) can be connected to an arrangement,
preferably a throttle device (20), for altering the quantity

of air drawn in.
Injector nozzle as claimed in one of the preceding
claims, characterised in that the air intake opening of the

mixing chamber can be connected to an air system which is
under positive pressure, for example the exhaust system of a

carrier vehicle.
Injector nozzle as claimed in one of the preceding
claims, characterized in that the air intake opening (6) of

the mixing chamber (5) is protected by a cover (18) which is
preferably formed by an annular plate which is integrated into

a fixing part (19) of the rapid closure system (9) for the
outlet element (7).
Injector nozzle as claimed in one of the preceding
claims, characterised in that for feeding further fluids

and/or gases to the mixing chamber at least one further intake
opening is provided.
