<ABSTRACT>
The present invention provides a novel internal standard for amino acid sequencing which contains a peptide consisting of unnatural amino acid residues, such as ornithine, norvaline, norleucine and (alpha)-aminobutyric acid, that is capable of being sequenced simultaneously with an unknown peptide or protein without interfering with the analysis. The internal standard peptide has an amino acid sequence containing at least two different unnatural amino acid residues having retention times distinct from the corresponding retention times for natural amino acid residues. Information derived from the sequencing of the internal standard allows determination of repetitive yield, lag, N-terminal blockage and discrimination between blank cycles caused by missed injection and blank cycles caused by faulty delivery of chemicals during the sequencer reactions. The present invention further provides novel synthetic control peptides containing from about 3 to 100 natural amino acid residues that are designed for use in monitoring the proper operation of amino acid sequencers and to monitor peptide or protein cleavage reactions. The control peptide, or mixture of control peptides, are designed to obtain data for many or all common, uncommon and difficult to measure amino acids within 15 sequencer cycles and to provide cleavage sites for at least 4 different amino acide cleavage reactants.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to novel peptides useful in the amino 
acid sequencing context and methods of their use. In particular, this invention 
relates to an internal standard for amino acid sequencing comprising unnatural 
amino acid residues that is capable of being sequenced simultaneously with an 
unknown peptide or protein without interfering with the analysis. Further, this 
invention relates to synthetic control peptides comprising natural amino acid 
residues that are designed for use in monitoring the proper operation of amino 
acid sequencers and for confirming that the system properly identifies all the 
common amino acid residues. These synthetic control peptides can also be used 
as controls in a wide variety of chemical and enzymatic reactions to monitor 
cleavage and modification reactions. Amino acid sequencers typically degrade a protein or peptide 
selectively and sequentially into amino acid residues, or derivatives of these 
residues, that are capable of being qualitatively and quantitatively identified. 
For instance, the commonly used Edman sequential degradation involves the 
organic base catalyzed selective coupling of a peptide's N-terminal amino acid 
with phenylisothiocyanate. The derivatized amino acid is then cleaved from the 
peptide by treatment with a strong organic acid, typically as an 
anilinothiazolinone (ATZ) derivative. Repetitive coupling/cleavage cycles at the 
newly-formed N-terminal amino acid left by the previous cycle provide for 
sequential separation of the amino acid residues that form the primary structure 
of the peptide. To determine the identity of the separated derivatives, the ATZ 
derivative is typically converted to a more stable phenylthiohydantoin (PTH) 
derivative prior to analysis. These PTH derivatives can then be identified by a 
variety of analytical procedures, such as by HPLC. The coupling/cleavage cycles, 
the PTH derivatization procedures and the injection of the PTH derivatives onto 
an HPLC can be accomplished manually or, more commonly, by fully automated 
amino acid sequencers as described, for instance, in Applied Biosystems User 
Bulletin Issue No. 14 (November 18, 1985).  
 Current internal standards available for use in an amino acid 
sequencer suffer from various disadvantages. For instance, addition of a 
synthetic PTH amino acid derivative, such as PTH-norleucine, to one of the 
sequencer solvents is known. This type of internal standard, however, is capable 
of indicating only that the sample was injected properly onto
