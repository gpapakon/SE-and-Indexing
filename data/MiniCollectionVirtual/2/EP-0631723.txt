<ABSTRACT>
Biocidal isothiazolinone or isothiazolothione compounds are 
stabilized with an effective amount of a free-radical scavenger 

compound. Exemplary of the biocidal isothiazolones are 1,2-benzisothiazolin-3-one, 
2-methyl-4,5-trimethylene-4-isothiazolin-3-one, 

5-chloro-2-methyl-4-isothiazolin-3-one and 2-methyl-4-isothiazolin-3-one. 

Effective free-radical scavengers include 3,3-thiodipropionic 
acid, L-ascorbic acid, D-ascorbic acid, fumaric acid, 

diethylhydroxylamine, glutaraldehyde, butyraldehyde, L-tartaric acid, 
4-methoxyphenol and propyl gallate.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an isothiazolinone or 
isothiazolothione biocide composition stabilized against 
attack by free radicals and a method for stabilizing the 
biocides. Biocides are substances that kill or inhibit the growth 
of microorganisms such as bacteria, fungi and algae. Biocidal 
chemicals include chlorinated hydrocarbons, organometallics, 
halogen-releasing compounds, metallic salts, quaternary 
ammonium compounds, phenolics and organic sulfur compounds. Exemplary of organic sulfur compounds are compounds based 
on an isothiazolinone or isothiazolothione structure. The 
biocidal activity of these compounds is effected by 
inactivation of essential enzymes of microbial metabolism 
which require sulfhydryl groups for activity. These enzymes 
include phosphoenolpyruvate transphosphorase and a number of 
dehydrogenases. The thio moiety of the isothiazolinone or 
isothiazolothione compounds reacts with the free sulfhydryl 
groups of an enzyme to form a disulfide bond between the 
enzyme molecule and the isothiazolinone or isothiazolothione 
molecule rendering the sulfhydryl unavailable for interaction 
with substrate or effector molecules. Isothiazolinone and isothiazolothione biocides have found 
widespread use as latex preservatives. Most latex emulsions 
are water based and are prone to microbial attack. Biocides 
are typically added to the finished latex after all processing 
is completed to protect the latex from microbial attack. Manufacture of latex by emulsion polymerization requires 
certain free-radical generating chemicals to initiate 
polymerization. At elevated temperatures, these  
 
radical-generating compounds undergo homolytic decomposition 
to form active free radicals which participate in the 
propagation reaction which makes polymerization possible. 
Several different types of thermal initiators are currently in 
use; exemplary are azo compounds and peroxy compounds such as 
2,2'-azobisisobutyronitrile, peroxydisulfate ion, benzoyl 
peroxide and t-butyl hydroperoxide. Alternatively, 
polymerization can be initiated with a redox initiator system 
containing an oxidizing and a reducing agent. The redox 
systems also generate free radicals; exemplary are ferrous ion 
with hydrogen peroxide, sodium formaldehyde sulfoxylate, 
sodium thiosulfate and sodium metabisulfite. During the manufacture of latex, the polymerization 
process is rarely allowed to proceed to 100% monomer to 
polymer conversion due to the negative effect of excessive 
chain branching and molecular
