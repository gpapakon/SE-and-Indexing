<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention is directed to a method for 
determining the product of a plurality of numbers and an 
apparatus for carrying out that method. In a computing system employing solid state components, 
preferably constructed from silicon components arrayed on 
a substrate, certain basic design criteria generally apply. 
For example, it is desired that the least space possible 
upon the substrate be occupied by each component. Further, 
it is desired that energy consumed by the apparatus be 
minimized as much as possible, especially in battery-supplied 
systems. Also, it is desired that the computing 
system operate as speedily as possible. A multiplier for such computing systems is generally 
fashioned of a matrix of switching transistors, which matrix 
is of sufficient size to accommodate the maximum expected  
 
size of numbers to be handled by the computing apparatus. 
Thus, for example, in order to have a multiplication of a 
4-digit number by a 4-digit number, a multiplier would 
necessarily comprise a 16×16 bit matrix (i.e., 16 columns 
of transistors, each column having 16 rows of transistors) 
with additional rows, or columns, or both to accommodate 
carries and other overhead operations involved in 
multiplication. For smaller numbers, higher significance bits within 
the multiplier matrix are zero-filled as appropriate to 
correctly store the multiplicand and the multiplier involved 
in the multiplication operation. However, those zero-filled 
bits must still be powered-up in order to effect such zero-filling. 
Such zero-filled bits are necessarily involved in 
the calculations effected by the multiplier, so speed of 
operation, power requirements, and "real estate" (i.e., 
space) occupancy on the substrate are all sacrificed in 
accommodating larger numbers for multiplication operations. It would be advantageous to have a multiplier which 
only powers-up a sufficient number of bits necessary for a 
specific multiplication operation to conserve power, 
especially in a battery-supplied system. It would be 
further advantageous to have a multiplier which occupies as 
little "real estate" as possible on the substrate in order 
to conserve space and enhance packaging of a system 
employing the multiplier. It would be still further 
advantageous to have a multiplier which speedily effects  
 
multiplication operations to enhance the operational speed 
of a system employing the multiplier. It would also be advantageous to effect multiplication 
by a method which facilitates design and operation
