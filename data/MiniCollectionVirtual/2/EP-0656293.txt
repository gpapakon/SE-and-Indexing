<ABSTRACT>
A vessel with a rotatable turret thereon is moored in a manner that 
minimizes turret tilt while avoiding the need to maintain precisely concentric 

upper and lower turret bearings. A mooring structure (152, Fig. 7) is formed 
by a group of mooring lines (162, 164) such as chains, with the upper ends of 

the lines coupled to the vessel through a connecting apparatus (154) that 
comprises a group of arms (166) each connected to a corresponding one of 

the lines. Each arm is pivotally mounted (at 170) on the turret to hang 
therefrom, so the arm transmits primarily vertical forces to the turret and the 

turret bearing (185) has to support primarily vertical forces. Each arm carries 
a bearing pad (174) that presses horizontally against a vessel lower bearing 

ring (182) mounted directly on the vessel hull independently of the turret. 
Substantially the entire horizontal components H of mooring force are 

transmitted from the arm pads to the lower vessel bearing ring, so the 
horizontal force components are not transmitted through the turret. As a result, 

the turret does not tend to tilt, and the vessel lower bearing ring which 
transmits horizontal mooring force components does not have to be mounted 

precisely concentric with the upper bearing.

<DESCRIPTION>
One type of vessel has a turret rotatably mounted on the vessel
hull, so the turret does not rotate with the hull. A mooring structure such as
several catenary lines extending up from the sea floor, connect to the turret, so
mooring forces that limit vessel drift are transmitted through the turret to the
vessel. A conduit with several hoses may extend from the sea floor up to the
nonrotating turret, and through a fluid swivel structure at the top of the turret
to pipes on the vessel.A typical prior art turret is supported on the vessel by upper and
lower bearings to withstand both the constant vertical load on the turret due to
the weight of the mooring lines, and to withstand large net horizontal mooring
forces applied during storms. One problem arising with such a system is that
the upper and lower bearings have to be mounted and maintained precisely
concentric on the vessel hull, which is very difficult to achieve. Even when
concentricity is achieved, it can be lost by deformations of the ship hull. Still
another problem is that the lower bearing is difficult to maintain and repair in
the field. While the upper bearing lies above the sea surface, the lower bearing
lies a considerable distance such as twenty meters below the sea surface,
where it is difficult to replace large parts. It is possible to use a single upper
bearing, but it is difficult to transfer large horizontal mooring load components
to such a single upper bearing, without large internal loading of the turret and
the use of a massive upper bearing. A mooring system for a turreted vessel
which simplified bearing installation, maintenance and repair, would be of
considerable value. Another prior art mooring system(US-A-3 774 562) has
two independently drivable positioning bases in the
form of rings. An upper of these rings carries mooring
chain winches and is disposed at the upper end of a
moonpool in the vessel. The lower of the rings is at
the bottom of the moonpool and carries fairleads for
the anchor chains.The system is designed with thrusters which prevent
substantial drift which would otherwise lead to large
horizontal forces being applied to the bases from the
mooring structures. The present invention allows for
the situation where there are no such thrusters and
the vessel will therefore drift substantially meaning
that large horizontal forces have to be withstood in
severe weather. In a first aspect, the present invention provides a
mooring system for a vessel that has a hull with walls
forming a primarily vertically-extending
