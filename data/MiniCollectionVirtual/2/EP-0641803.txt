<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to an organoleptically improved, 
water-soluble polydextrose containing less than 0.01 mol % 
of bound citric acid, to processes for preparing improved 
polydextrose characterized by its content of less than 0.3 
mol percent or less of citric acid bound in the form of 
ester groups, and to foods containing the same. The 
improved, water-soluble polydextrose of this invention is 
prepared by reducing the bound citric acid content of 
unimproved, water-soluble polydextrose, preferably by 
passing the unimproved, water-soluble polydextrose through 
one or more specified resins. Bound citric acid is also 
referred to herein as citric acid bound in the form of ester 
groups. These citrate esters are primarily dibasic, and so 
generally retain a measure of acidity. While the process of 
the invention coincidentally reduces free citric acid to 
less than 0.1 mol %, free citric acid can be added back 
where acidity is desired. As used herein, the expression "water-soluble 
polydextrose" (also known as polyglucose or poly-D-glucose) 
specifically refers to the water-soluble polydextrose 
prepared by melting and heating dextrose (also known as 
glucose or D-glucose), preferably with about 5-15% by weight 
of sorbitol present, in the presence of a catalytic amount 
(about 0.5 to 3.0 mol %) of citric acid. Water-soluble 
polydextrose is an item of commerce which, as an approved 
food additive, is defined in the Food and Drug Section of 
the Code of Federal Regulations (21 C.F.R. 172.841). In its 
unimproved form, it is also described by Rennhard, U.S. 
Patent 3,766,165, which claims, inter alia, a "[w]ater 
soluble highly branched poly[dextrose] wherein the linkage 
of 1 → 6 predominates, having number average molecular 
weight between about 1,500 and 18,000 and containing from 
about 0.5 to 5 mole percent of [citric] acid ester groups 
. . .", i.e., water-soluble polydextrose characterized by 
its content of from about 0.5 to 5 mol % of bound citric  
 
acid; and by Rennhard, U.S. Patent 3,876,794, which claims 
various foods containing same. According to Rennhard, 
water-soluble polydextrose is preferably prepared using 0.5-5 
mol percent of citric acid as catalyst. However, since 
Rennhard's use of about 6 mol percent of citric acid 
produced more than two thirds undesired insoluble 
polydextrose, we prefer use of citric acid at a level in the 
range of about 0.5 to 3 mol percent, approximating the 1% by 
weight noted in the C.F.R., cited above. Rennhard also 
specified optional use of
