<ABSTRACT>
The new invention proposes that a control drive be designed as a multi-variable controller (25). For this purpose, it has a monitoring unit (control unit) (26) consisting of a drive intelligence device (23) with a process computer (22) and a user memory (24) for programs and recipes. Either the speed or the current input to an electric motor (1) is selected. Depending on the requirement, a force, a speed or a travel with respect to time can be transferred as target variables from a high-level machine computer (15, 16) to the user memory (24), which now presets the corresponding values as control variables (or design limits) in order to approach the target variable nominal values as closely as possible. In addition, a novel multi-shaft drive (30) is ÄlacunaÜ for the formation of a module of at least two, and in particular for three or more, shafts, having corresponding drive monitoring devices (20), having an interface for a data transmission system and/or the machine computer (15, 16). The operating sequence can be defined in the machine computer (15, 16) and can be predetermined as corresponding nominal values. These are fed directly or via the data transmission system to the recipe memory (24) of the process computer (22), which (?) monitors and at the same time controls and/or regulates a plurality of shafts in a coordinated manner as a multi-variable controller.
