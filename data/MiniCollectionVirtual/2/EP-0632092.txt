<ABSTRACT>
U.V. light stabilizer combinations comprising (a) an aliphatic piperidinyl 
derivative, and (b) a high molecular weight hindered amine light stabilizer. The 

combinations are especially effective for stabilizing polyolefins that are extruded 
into thin films or fibers.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention pertains broadly to hindered amine light stabilizers. 
The invention more particularly concerns mixtures of hindered amines which 
display coactive or synergistic properties in their ability to light stabilize organic 
polymers. The invention is especially attractive for use with polyolefins, notably 
in thin films, fibers and the like. It is well known that sunlight and other sources of ultraviolet radiation 
cause degradation of organic polymers as evidenced by embrittlement or yellowing 
of plastic articles produced from such polymers. It is also well known to 
incorporate ultra-violet light stabilizers into such articles in an effort to inhibit 
such degradation. Many ultra-violet light stabilizers are currently commercially 
available for this purpose. These include, for example, those common ultra-violet 
light stabilizers listed in the following U.S. Patents: U.S. Patent No. 4,331,586, 
issued to Hardy; U.S. Patent No. 4,863,981, issued to Gugumus; and U.S. Patent 
No. 5,021,485 issued to Gugumus.  Hardy discloses oligomers of the formula 
which contain at least one piperidinyl moiety in the repeating unit and are useful 
as light stabilizers for polymers. This group of compounds or formula is 
identified as Formula III of the instant invention. Gugumus '981 discloses a light stabilizer system containing two high-molecular 
weight polyalkylpiperidines. This system is used to protect organic 
material against degradation induced by light. Gugumus discloses Formulas II and 
IV of the instant invention. Gugumus '485 discloses a light stabilizer system containing a combination 
of specific low molecular weight and high molecular weight polyalkylpiperidines. 
This system is used to protect organic materials against light induced degradation. Currently available light stabilizers such as those mentioned above have 
met with mixed success in inhibiting polymers against degradation. Synthetic 
polymers are produced in a wide variety of forms and applications, and the 
aforementioned compounds satisfactorily stabilize only a few variations. For 
example, very few low molecular weight light stabilizers are effective for 
polyolefins, especially when these polymers are extruded into thin film or fibers.  
 
In this instance, the low molecular weight stabilizers tend to flash off during the 
extrusion process. Relatively high molecular weight light stabilizers are less volatile than low 
molecular weight stabilizers, but the high molecular weight light stabilizers 
sometimes tend to
