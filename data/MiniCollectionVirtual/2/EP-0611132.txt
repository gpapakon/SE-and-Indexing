<ABSTRACT>
A self-closing receiverless surgical fastener (50) 
comprises a fastener body (51) of biocompatible or 

bioabsorbable material including a bridge member (52) 
and at least two tines (54) extending from opposite ends 

of the bridge member. The tines are resiliently 
deformable from a normally closed position with the 

distal ends (58) of the tines pointing toward each other 
to an open position with the distal ends of the 

tines extending substantially parallel to each 
other for penetrating into tissue. The tines (54) are 

resiliently returnable to the closed position with 
the distal ends (58) of the tines pointing toward each 

other to secure the fastener body (51) to the tissue.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a surgical 
fastener and, more particularly, to a surgical 
fastener of biocompatible or bioabsorbable material 
which is adapted to secure a hernia patch to 
internal body tissue. Surgical fasteners, or staples, are commonly 
used in surgical procedures to allow a surgeon to 
fasten body tissue together without the need for 
time consuming suturing procedures. The surgical 
fasteners can be applied to the body tissue by 
using surgical staplers which operate to install 
the fasteners one at a time or to apply a plurality 
of fasteners in succession or simultaneously. The 
staplers typically include fastener cartridges from 
which the fasteners are driven into the tissue. US-A-4485816, on which the two-part form of claim 1 is based, discloses 
a staple which has a shape memory. The staple can be formed into a 
closed shape at a high temperature, deformed into an open shape at 
a low temperature and then caused to revert to the closed shape upon 
heating.  
 Two-part surgical fastener devices are 
previously known. Such devices include a fastener 
member, or staple, which is generally U-shaped in 
configuration with a pair of prongs, and a receiver 
member provided with apertures in which the prongs 
are engaged and latched. The fastener prongs 
pierce the body tissue from one side and the 
receiver member latches the prongs on the other 
side of the tissue. The surgical fasteners, once 
engaged, are not separable so that, after being 
inserted into the body tissue, the fasteners cannot 
be easily removed. Accordingly, two-part surgical  
 
fasteners usually consist of bioabsorbable material 
which is absorbed into the body tissue. In the past, hernia repair procedures have 
been performed by open surgery in which an 
elongated incision is made in the body wall for 
access to the internal body tissue to be repaired. 
Such open surgery is traumatic to the patient and a 
long recovery period is required for the incision 
to heal. Typically, the hernia repair is performed 
by conventional suturing techniques. A hernia 
repair patch, if used, is secured to the internal 
body tissue by sutures applied along the edges of 
the patch. More recently, endoscopic instruments and 
techniques have been developed to perform surgery 
on internal body tissue, including hernia repairs. 
Such procedures are performed by installing an 
endoscopic tube in a small incision in the body 
wall and by inserting the surgical instruments into 
the endoscopic tube to perform the desired surgery.

<CLAIMS>
A surgical fastener (50), comprising: 

a fastener body (51) including a bridge member (52) and at least 
two tines (54) extending from opposite ends of said bridge 

member (52), said tines (54) each having a distal end (58) for penetrating 
tissue; wherein said tines (54) are movable from a normally closed 

position with said distal ends (58) of said tines (54) pointing toward 
each other, to an open position with said distal ends (58) of said tines 

(54) extending substantially parallel to each other for penetrating into 
the tissue to secure said fastener body (51) to the tissue, 

characterised in that  
 
said tines (54) are resiliently mechanically deformable from 
the normally closed position to the open position; and 
said tines (54) being resiliently returnable to said closed 
position with said distal ends (58)of said tines (54) pointing toward 

each other to secure said fastener body (51) to the tissue. 
A surgical fastener (50) as claimed in claim 1, wherein
 
   said tines (54) including proximal portions (56) extending 

substantially parallel to each other from said bridge member (52) 
and distal portions (58) extending transversely from said 

proximal portions (56) and pointing toward each other 
The surgical fastener (50) of claim 1 or claim 2, wherein:
 
   said fastener body (51) consists of resilient material. 
The surgical fastener (50) of claim 1 or claim 2, wherein:
 
   said fastener body (51) consists of biocompatible material. 
The surgical fastener (50) of claim 1 or claim 2, wherein:
 
   said fastener body (51) consists of bioabsorbable material.  

 
The surgical fastener (50) of any preceding claim, wherein:
 
   each of said tines (54) has a resilient hinge-like section (64) 

which normally maintains said distal ends (58) of said tines (54) 
pointing toward each other. 
The surgical fastener (50) of claim 6, wherein:
 
   said resilient hinge-like sections (64) permit said distal 

ends (58) of said tines (54) to pivot from a closed position pointing 
toward each other to an open position substantially parallel 

to each other. 
The surgical fastener (50) of claim 6, wherein:
 
   each tine (54) has a tab (114) adjacent to said hinge-like section (64) 

which projects laterally outward when said distal ends (58) of 
said tines (54) are pointing toward each other. 
The surgical fastener (50) of claim 6, wherein:
 
   a portion of each tine (54) is removed adjacent to said 

hinge-like section (64) to enhance the resiliency of said tines (54). 
The surgical fastener (50) of any preceding claim, wherein:
 
   said bridge member (52) is curved in shape and extends 

between the proximal ends (56) of said tines (54). 
The surgical fastener (50) of any preceding claim, wherein:
 
   said bridge member (52) is reduced in thickness compared with 

said tines (54) for slidably receiving an actuator between said 
tines (54) to apply pressure to pivot said distal ends (58) of said 

tines (54).
