<ABSTRACT>
A novel SLe-type sugar chain derivative represented by general formula [I], which is useful as a medicine and has a novel 

structure containing moranoline, wherein R¹ represents hydrogen, lower alkyl, lower alkenyl or lower alkynyl; R² and R³ represent 
each independently galactosyl, sialylgalactosyl or fucosyl; and R⁴ represents hydroxy or acetamido. This compound 

has the activity of inhibiting cell adhesion and inhibits secretin antagonistically, thus being useful for treating inflammation 
and its accompanying thrombosis, asthma and rheumatism, and for preventing and treating immunopathy and cancer.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a new sialyl Lewis X (hereinafter abbreviated SLex) 
type and sialyl Lewis A (hereinafter abbreviated SLea) type ganglioside sugar chain 
derivatives represented by the following formula (I), which are useful in pharmaceutical 
fields such as treatment and prevention of inflammation, inflammation-associated 
thrombosis, asthma, rheumatism, immunological diseases and cancer: 
wherein R¹ represents hydrogen, a lower alkyl, a lower alkenyl or a lower alkynyl; R² 
and R³ independently represent galactosyl, sialylgalactosyl or fucosyl; R⁴ represents a 
hydroxyl or acetamido. Recent studies have demonstrated that the sugar chains of glycolipids and glycoproteins 
function as receptors of hormones, bacterial toxins, viruses and others and are 
profoundly involved in basic dynamic biological phenomena such as cell recognition, 
differentiation/proliferation, adhesion, transformation, immunity and aging. Cell surface sugar chains, closely associated with blood group substances such as those 
of the ABO(H antigen), Lewis(Le antigen) and Ii blood types, are also detected as 
cancer-related sugar chain antigens. For this reason, there have been studies to apply 
monoclonal antibodies, that specifically recognize this series of sugar chains, to cancer 
diagnosis and treatment.  The sialyl Le type sugar chain antigen, a tetrasaccharide sugar chain antigen basically 
composed of α(2 → 3) sialyl and α(1 → 3 and 1 → 4) fucosylated lactosamine, and 
found in sialoglycoprotein sugar chains as well as in gangliosides, has been used in 
serologic diagnosis of cancer as a sugar chain antigen for pulmonary adenocarcinoma 
and digestive tract cancer. Also, sialyl Lex sugar chains have very recently been 
reported as functioning as sugar chain ligands for the leukocyte adhesion factor 
appearing on vascular endothelial cells during inflammation [Lowe, J.B., et al., Cell, 
63, 475-484 (1990)]. It is very difficult, however, to obtain these sugar chains as a pure single compound 
from the living body because they are present in the cell surface layer only in trace 
amounts. Against this background various synthetic compounds, including derivatives, have 
been studied, but none have been known to have moranoline (1-deoxynojirimycin) as a 
sugar chain component like the compounds of the present invention. The object of the present invention is to provide a sugar chain derivative that is useful 
as a pharmaceutical and has a new structure. Through extensive research, the present inventors found that
