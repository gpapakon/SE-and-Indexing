<ABSTRACT>
An operating unit (1), in the example shown a 
fantail twisting unit, wherein a feed device (7) with a 

number of transportation heads (10) for respective 
products (4), in the example shown products (4) with a 

wrapping (3) having at least one open end (2), 
successively feeds the products (4) along a curved path 

(17a) through an operating station (6), in the example 
shown a station for closing the wrappings (3), where 

each product (4) is engaged by a tool (59), in the 
example shown a mechanical hand, for performing a given 

operation on the product (4), in the example shown for 
fantail twisting the open end of the wrapping (3); the 

tool (59) being fitted to a toolholder device (18) by 
which it is fed through the operating station (6) 

simultaneously with a respective product (4) and along 
the same curved path (17a) along which the product (4) 

travels.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an operating unit 
for handling moving products. Though employable in any technical field for 
performing one or more operations on moving products or 
objects in general, the present invention is 
particularly suitable for use in the confectionary 
industry, for "fantailing" the wrappings of products, 
especially sweets and similar, fed substantially 
continuously along a given path. For this reason, the following description refers 
specifically, though purely by way of example, to a 
fantail forming unit of the type comprising a wrapping 
closing station; a feed device with a given number of 
transportation heads for feeding the closing station 
with respective products having a wrapping with at least 
one open end portion; and a closing device located at 
the closing station, for fantailing the open end portion 
of each wrapping, and comprising at least one tool 
consisting of a mechanical hand revolving about its 
axis.  
 Operating units of the aforementioned type are 
known to comprise step operated feed devices, the 
transportation heads of which are fed successively and 
in steps through the closing station where, in the event 
the wrappings present only one open end portion, a 
single operating hand successively engages the 
respective open end portions of the wrappings as the 
respective transportation heads are arrested at the 
closing station. In the event both the end portions of 
each wrapping are open, the closing station obviously 
presents two opposed operating hands. A major drawback of known operating units of the 
aforementioned type is that, by virtue of being step 
operated, the operating speed of the units is relatively 
slow and totally inadequate for the wrapping machines 
currently available on the market. In an attempt to overcome the above drawback, an 
operating unit is disclosed in GB-A-2 035 253 featuring 
a continuously operated feed device, each transportation 
head of which presents a closing element moving with the 
head and in turn featuring at least one operating hand. While enabling relatively fast operating speeds, 
continuously operated units of the above type are 
invariably expensive and unreliable due to the complex 
mechanical design of the feed devices and the number of 
components involved. Moreover, by virtue of the complex 
mechanical design of the feed devices, the areas in 
which the wrappings are actually fantailed are rendered  
 
substantially inaccessible, and any change in format 
economically unfeasible. In other

<CLAIMS>
An operating unit (1) for handling moving 
products (4), the unit comprising an operating station 

(6) for performing a given operation on said products 
(4); a feed device (7) having a given number of 

transportation heads (10) for respective said products 
(4), and designed to feed the products (4) successively 

along a first given path (17a) through the operating 
station (6); and an operating device (18) located at the 

operating station (6), for performing said operation on 
said products (4), and comprising at least one operating 

tool (59), and drive means (96) for moving said tool 
(59) about a first axis (22) according to a first given 

law of motion, and along a second, annular, path (97); 
characterized by the fact that said drive means (96) 

comprise a hypocyclic drive (96); said secon path (97) 
comprising an active portion (98a) substantially 

coinciding with said first path (17a). 
A unit as claimed in Claim 1, characterized by 
the fact that each transportation head (10) is movable 

about a second axis (9) parallel to the first axis (22); 
actuating means (16) being provided for moving the 

transportation head (10) according to a second law of 
motion, substantially the same as the first law of 

motion, as the transportation head (10) travels along 
said first path (17a). 
A unit as claimed in Claim 1 or 2,  
 

characterized by the fact that the operating device (18) 
comprises a given number of said tools (59) 

substantially equally spaced about the first axis (22); 
the number of the tools (59) being independent of the 

number of transportation heads (10). 
A unit as claimed in any one of the foregoing 
Claims, characterized by the fact that said second path 

(97) is a quadrangular path, one side (98a) of which 
coincides with said first path (17a).

the fact that said side (98a) is curved with its 

concavity facing outwards towards the second axis (9). 
A unit as claimed in anyone of the preceding 
Claims, characterized by the fact that said hypocyclic 

drive (96) comprises a sun gear (52) coaxial with the 
first axis (22); a carrier element (37) rotating about 

the first axis (22); and, for each tool (59), a 
planetary gear (53) rotating about a third axis (48) 

parallel to the first axis (22). 
A unit as claimed in Claim 6, characterized by 
the fact that each tool (59) extends along a fourth axis 

(55) parallel to the first axis (22); said drive (96) 
also comprising, for each said tool (59), a supporting
