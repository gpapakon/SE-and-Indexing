<ABSTRACT>
The present invention relates to a structure 
for connecting electrodes of a motor unit and a motor 

driver unit which is a power circuit for the motor unit 
in an electric power drive vehicle, so that the motor 

unit and the motor driver unit are electrically 
connected to each other. 
The structure includes: electrode terminals 
(31) to which a coil of the motor unit is connected and 

which are provided with fixing nuts; substantially L-shaped 
electrode plates (28) each formed at one end with 

a terminal portion (37) connected to the inverter 
circuit (4) and at the other end with a contact portion 

(35) to which the electrode terminal (31) is connected, 
the contact portion being formed with an insertion hole 

(34); L-shaped resin electrode bases (29) for attaching 
the electrodes plates (28) to a metallic frame (21) 

under an insulated condition, each of the electrode 
bases including an elongated hole (39) for attaching a 

bolt to be engaged with the insertion hole (34) of the 
electrode plate and a guide groove (43) for preventing 

the electrode plate (28) from rotation; and bolts (33) 
each extending through the elongated hole of the 

electrode base so as to connect the electrode terminal 
(31) to the electrode plate (28).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a structure 
for connecting electrodes of a motor unit and a motor 
driver unit which is a power circuit for the motor unit 
in an electric power drive vehicle, so that the motor 
unit and the motor driver unit are electrically 
connected to each other. In a device employing a conventional structure 
for connecting electrodes of a motor unit and a motor 
driver unit, the motor unit 1 is located on the right 
side of the device in Fig. 4. A motor 3 is secured in a 
cylindrical casing 2 of the motor unit 1. The motor 
driver unit 6 covered with a cylindrical casing 5 is 
located on the left side of the device. The motor 
driver unit 6 is provided with an inverter circuit 4 for 
driving the motor 3. Both of the units are integrally 
coupled to each other by means of fixing screws 7. 
Connecting cables 9 of a driving coil 8 of the motor 3 
are extended out of the casing 2. By way of example, as 
shown in Fig. 4, connection terminals 10 of the cables 9 
are connected by nuts 13 to bolts 12 as connection 
terminals for the inverter circuit 4 which are provided 
on an outer peripheral surface of the casing 5 of the  
 
motor driver unit 6, with insulation bases 11 being 
interposed therebetween. Reference numeral 14 
designates a motor drive shaft, numeral 15 designates a 
drive pulley, and numeral 16 designates a capacitor. Fig. 5 illustrates another example of the 
conventional structure of electrically connecting the 
electrodes of the motor unit and the motor driver unit, as 
disclosed in EP-A-531 200. 
More specifically, the connecting cables 9 of the 
driving coil 8 of the motor 3 are extended through the 
interior of the casing so as to be drawn out of the 
surface of the casing 5 for the motor driver unit 6 on 
the left side in the drawing. The connection terminals 
10 of the connecting cables 9 are connected by the nuts 
13 to bolts 17 as connection terminals for the inverter 
circuit 4 (not illustrated in Fig. 5), which bolts are 
provided on the left-side surface of the casing 5 with 
the insulation bases 11 being interposed therebetween. 
Secured to the other ends of the connection bolts 17 are 
electrode plates 19 comprising printed circuit boards on 
which power semiconductor elements are mounted, the 
electrode plates including terminal sections 18 to be 
connected to the inverter circuit 4. The connection 
cables 9 may be replaced by wiring metallic means 20 
made of plate-like or linear conductors. In any example of the conventional structure 
of connecting the
