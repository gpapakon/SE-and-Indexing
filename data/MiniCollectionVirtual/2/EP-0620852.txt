<ABSTRACT>
The present invention provides the nucleotide sequences of Acetobacter operons, cdg operons encoding genes for the biosynthesis and degradation of cyclic diguanosine monophosphate (c-di-GMP). Specifically, the nucleotide sequences and deduced amino acid sequences of 3 phosphodiesterases isozymes, 3 diguanylate cyclase isozymes, and 2 polypeptides of unidentified function are provided. Also provided for are various strains of microorganisms, including Acetobacter cells genetically manipulated so as to produce elevated and/or reduced levels of one or more cdg operon encoded proteins.

<DESCRIPTION>
 CYCLIC DI-GUANYLATE METABOLIC ENZYMESField of the InventionThe invention relates to the field of recombinant DNA techniques for the production of proteins and the manipulation of metabolic pathways. More specifically, this invention relates to the cloning of diguanylate cyclase operons, the expression and regulation of the operons, and methods of using the operons for modifying the production of cellulose in microorganisms.Background of the InventionCellulose is relied upon as the raw material for a number of useful products including paper products and wound dressings. Cellulose may be obtained from plants and various microorganisms in culture, for example from the cellulose producing bacteria of the genus Acetobacter. Acetobacter is characteristically a Gram-negative, rod-shaped bacterium 0.6-0.8 μm by 1.0-4 μm. It is strictly aerobic; metabolism is respiratory, never fermentative. It is further distinguished by the ability to produce multiple poly /3(l-4)-glucan chains, chemically identical to cellulose. Multiple cellulose chains or microfibrils are synthesized at the bacterial surface at sites on the cell wall. The production of cellulose by Acetobacter has been the subject of intense study since at least the 1930's. In particular, Acetobacter xylinum has been widely studied to attempt to elucidate the mechanism of cellulose synthesis in intact cells [Schramm and Hestrin, (1954) J. Gen. Microbiol. 11:123- 129].The enzymatic pathway for cellulose synthesis in Acetobacter xylinum has been investigated and essen¬ tially four enzymatic steps have been characterized in cell-free extracts of A. xylinum which appear to 

 comprise the complete pathway from glucose to cellulose.These are the phosphorylation of glucose by glucokinase[Benziman, et al. , (1972) J. Bactβriol.. 111:325-330], the isomerization of glucose-6-phosphate to glucose-1- phosphate by phosphoglucomutase [Gromet, et al., (1957)Biochem. J.. 67:579-689; Frei-Roit an, Factors affecting the activity of phosphoglucomutase and UDP-glucose pyrophosphorylase of Acetobacter xylinum. M.Sc. thesis,The Hebrew University of Jerusalem, Jerusalem, Israel (1974)]; the synthesis of uridine 5'-diphosphoglucose(UDP-glc) by UDPG-pyrophosphorylase, [Frei-Roitman, supra: Swissa, Biosynthesis of cellulose in Acetobacter xylinum. Ph.D. thesis, The Hebrew University ofJerusalem,. Jerusalem, Israel (1978)], and the cellulose synthase reaction.The novel nucleotide activator c-di-GMP, i.e., cyclic diguanosine monophosphate is essential for the high activity of
