<ABSTRACT>
Fig. 1 illustrates the construction of an audio 
signal processor according to the present invention. An 

audio signal enters from a microphone 1 and a bandpass 
filter 2 extracts the frequency band of the human voice. 

The resulting signal is amplified by an amplifier 3. A 
level detecting circuit 4 detects the level of the 

amplified signal. A level discriminating circuit 5 
determines if the level is greater than the value. If 

yes, the circuit 5 outputs a switch-on signal. Or else, 
the circuit 5 outputs a switch-off signal. An A/D 

converter 6 converts the analog signal entering from the 
circuit 5 into a digital signal. A pitch detecting 

circuit 7 detects the pitch of the digital signal. A 
pitch discriminating circuit 8 determines if the pitch 

of the signal agrees with a prescribed pitch. If yes, 
the circuit 8 outputs the switch-on signal to the voice-output 

control switch 13. On the basis of the switch-on 
or switch-off signal, the switch 13 generates an on/off 

control signal, which causes a voltage-controlled 
amplifier 9 to amplify and output the voice signal and 

output to a mixer 10. Voice processing circuits S and S' 
are identical in construction. Microphones 1, 1' of the 

processing circuits S, S' are connected to a mixer 10. 
The latter mixes the audio outputted by the microphones 

1, 1'. An amplifier 11 amplifies the mixed voice 
signals. A speaker 12 outputs the audio.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to an audio signal
processing method and apparatus and, more particularly,
to an audio signal processing method and apparatus in a
television conference system using a plurality of
microphones (input means) in which it is possible to
determine whether an individual in front of a microphone
is currently speaking or not and whether an audio signal
that has entered via a microphone is a voice signal or
an unnecessary sound such as noise.In conventional television conference systems, a
signal processor for the purpose of controlling video
cameras uses a level detector to detect the level of an
audio signal that has entered via a microphone and
determines, on the basis of the level detected by the
level detector, whether an individual in front of the
microphone is currently speaking or not. In other
words, when the level of the audio signal exceeds a
predetermined value, the signal processor judges that
the individual in front of the microphone is currently
speaking, turns on an audio output switch that delivers
the signal from the microphone to a speaker serving as 
an output device, and changes over from one video camera
to another so that the video camera will point in the
direction of the microphone.In such a system in which control is performed to
switch among video cameras on the basis of the audio
signal, the video cameras react to undesirable sounds
such as noise and reverberation by operating
erroneously.In order to solve this problem, attempts have
recently been made to provide the microphones with
directivity so as to minimize the pick-up of undesirable
sounds such as noise and reverberation.However, the pick-up of undesirable sounds such as
noise and reverberation cannot be prevented reliably
even with a highly directional microphones. In
addition, there is an increase in total gain when the
audio output switch for delivering signals from a
plurality of microphones to the output device is turned
on. Moreover, the pick-up of undesirable sounds such as
noise and reverberation worsens the overall S/N ratio
and causes an audio signal to penetrate the plurality of
microphones. This is a cause of howling.Accordingly, in the conventional audio signal
processor, it is not possible to reliably determine
whether an individual in front of a microphone is
currently speaking or not and whether an audio signal 
that has entered via a microphone is a voice signal or
an undesirable sound such as noise. As a result, the
video cameras operate erroneously by reacting to these
undesirable
