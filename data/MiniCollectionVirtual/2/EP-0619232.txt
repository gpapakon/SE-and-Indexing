The device disclosed comprises a support frame (1) 
to which an internal hollow shaft (2) and an 

external hollow shaft (9) are constrained, the 
shafts (2 and 9) being coaxial and connected by 

cogwheels (7 and 12) to the command shaft of the 
conveyor line and to the command shaft of the 

labelling group, and being further connected to 
each other by a coaxial joint (8), which is movable 

along an axis common to the shafts (2,9) in order to vary the angular 
relationship between the shafts.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a device for changing the 
angular relation between a kinematically-connected 
carousel conveyor and a labelling group of a 
labelling machine. Specifically, but not exclusively, the device is 
useful in labelling machines where the label 
application position has to be changed. Such label 
application is performed by special applicator 
tools on moving objects on a motorised carousel 
conveyor. The need to change the label application position 
arises, for example, in cases where objects of 
different shapes and sizes are to be labelled: 
obviously, the labelling machine organs have to be 
repositioned to the new references required by the 
shape of the new objects. Such a repositioning 
operation is complicated, however, since the 
labelling group must stay synchronised with the 
movement of the carousel: it is usually achieved 
through mechanical transmissions connecting the  
 
labelling machine to the carousel motorisation. 
At present the labelling group is adapted to a new 
shape of object to be labelled by rephasing the 
angular position of a command shaft of the 
labelling machine organs with respect to the 
command shaft of the conveyor. Known devices of 
this type exhibit some drawbacks, however, 
regarding their constructive complexity, which is 
due to the fact that they cannot be applied in 
cases where the labelling group can only rotate 
about a vertical axis. WO-A-91/14625 discloses an equipping machine for treating 
vessels of different shape. The machine has a revolving 
platform provided with rotary plates, each with an 
associated positioning element which cooperates with radial 
cams. The positioning elements and/or the radial cams must 
be adjusted when it is necessary to change the form or the 
type of vessels. Said document does not overcome the above mentioned 
drawbacks of the prior art. A principal aim of the present invention is to 
provide a constructionally simple but economical 
and practical device which, in a very short time, 
enables the labelling machine organs to be 
repositioned to correspond with the shape and size 
of an object transiting on the conveyor. One advantage of the present invention is that it 
enables the labelling machine organs to be 
repositioned continuously and without the need to 
stop the machines. These aims and advantages and others besides are 
all achieved by the device of the invention, as it 
is defined in the claims, wherein two 
coaxial shafts are connected to a joint by means  
 
of pawls engaging in guide

a first hollow shaft (2) and a second hollow shaft 

(9) constrained to the support frame (1) with 
freedom to rotate about a same axis, the first 

hollow shaft being connected to a command shaft of 
a conveyor line and the second hollow shaft being 

connected to a command shaft of a labeling organ 
assembly;
 
a joint (8), coaxial with the first hollow shaft 

(2) and the second hollow shaft (9) and

instrument of an axial displacement of the joint 

(8). 
A device as in claim 3, wherein the instrument of 
measurement is a potentiometer (23), comprising a 

cursor (24) solid to the joint (8). 
A device as in claim 1, comprising a cogwheel (7) 
keyed on the first hollow shaft (2) and another 

cogwheel (12) keyed on the second hollow shaft
