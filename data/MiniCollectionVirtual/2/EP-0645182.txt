<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to the use of nickel or of a nickel-molybdenum compound which, in addition to molybdenum, contains more than 30% nickel and is thermally treated for a period of 0.25 to 10 hours at temperatures of 400 to 1200 DEG C in an air atmosphere and is then subjected to a hydrogen activation in the temperature range from 200 to 600 DEG C, if appropriate, prior to the thermal treatment, treatment with a mineral acid, preferably with nitric acid, at temperatures of 0 to 100 DEG C being performed, as a catalyst for the hydrorefining of hydrocarbon mixtures which contain heteroatoms such as nitrogen, oxygen, sulphur and/or halogens.
