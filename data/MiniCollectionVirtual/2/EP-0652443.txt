<ABSTRACT>
Electric bus bar insulating coatings are 
calibrated to withstand long term outdoor 

exposure without failure. Manufacturing samples 
of the coating material are evaluated at the 

coating manufacturing site prior to shipment to 
the bus bar manufacturer. Bus bar samples 

coated with the material are suspended within a 
heated water bath and subjected to several 

hundred volt-amperes. The thickness of the 
coating is predetermined to provide accurate 

qualifying data for each coating sample within 
a reasonable time frame. Coating compositions 

that qualify are then applied to electric bus 
bar conductors by the bus bar manufacturer.

<DESCRIPTION>
U.S. Patent 3,384,856 entitled "Multiphase 
Electric Power Distribution System" describes 
the close attachment of high ampere-rated bus 
bar conductors by means of insulated bolts and 
insulative coatings. The close coupling of the 
bus bars was intended to provide good heat 
transfer away from the bus bars to the 
heat-sinking metal support frame. The absence 
of thermally stable and moisture resistant 
insulative material prevented the close 
coupling concept from commercial feasibility 
until the development of epoxy electrical 
insulating material. U.S.Patent 4,804,804 
entitled "Thermally Efficient Power Busway 
Housing" describes electric bus bar conductors 
employing epoxy material as in insulation 
coating that are bolted together by means of 
insulated bolts. The thermal and electrical insulating 
properties of the epoxy material render the 
epoxy superior to other plastic resins for bus 
bar insulation coatings. The tendency of the 
epoxy to react with moisture is controlled by 
the addition of proprietary hydrolytic  
 
materials to the epoxy composition. However, 
to insure good long term resistance to extreme 
moisture conditions, the bus bar manufacture 
subjects sample epoxy-coated bus bars to 
extreme water submersion and electrical 
energizing testing before qualifying the epoxy 
material for large scale production quantities. Current practice is to subject 
representative numbers of sample epoxy-coated 
bus bars to such "water-test" conditions for at 
least one thousand hours before qualifying the 
epoxy material for large scale bus bar 
insulation. The long tests and evaluation 
processes involved add to the overall cost of 
the already expensive epoxy material. It would 
be economically advantageous to provide a 
simple short time test for qualifying epoxy 
material for bus bar insulation coatings. One purpose of the invention is to 
describe a simple apparatus and process for 
qualifying epoxy as an electrical bus bar 
insulation material in a substantially 
shortened time frame. The invention comprises the application of 
sample epoxy coatings of predetermined 
thickness to electric bus bars and subjecting 
the coated bus bars to a submersion water test  
 
while electrically-energized. The controlled 
thickness provides rapid indication of the 
hydrolytic stability of the epoxy coating. The 
epoxy materials which qualify are then produced 
in large quantities and are shipped to the 
electric bus bar manufacture within a 
reasonable time frame. Figure 1 is a graphic representation
