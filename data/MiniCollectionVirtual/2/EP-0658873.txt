<ABSTRACT>
A line spectral frequency (LSF) vector quantizer, having 
particular application in digital cellular networks (DCN), is provided for code 

excited linear predictive (CELP) speech encoders. The LSF vector quantizer 
is efficient in terms of bits employed, robust and effective in terms of 

performance across speakers and handsets, moderate in terms of complexity, 
and accommodates effective and simple built-in transmission error detection 

schemes. The LSF vector quantizer employs a minimum number of bits, is of 
moderate complexity and incorporates built-in error detection capability in 

order to combat transmission errors. The LSF vector quantizer classifies 
unquantized line spectral frequencies into four categories, employing different 

vector quantization tables for each category. Each quantization table is 
optimized for particular types of vectors. For each category, three split vector 

codebooks are used with a simplified error measure to find three candidate 
split quantized vectors. The three sets of three split vectors are combined to 

produce as many as 27 vectors from each category. The quantizer then 
makes a final selection of optimal category, using a more complex error 

measure, to achieve the robust performance across speakers and handsets. 

Split vector quantization follows a two stage constrained search procedure that 
results in an ordered set of quantized line spectral frequencies that is "close" 

to the unquantized set with moderate complexity within each category. 
Effective and simple transmission error detection schemes at the receiver are 

made possible by the split nature of the vector quantization and the 
constrained search procedure. Only twenty-six bits are required to encode ten 

line spectral frequencies.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention generally relates to digital voice 
communications systems and, more particularly, to a line spectral 
frequency vector quantizer for code excited linear predictive (CELP) 
speech encoders which is efficient in terms of bits employed, robust and 
effective in terms of performance across speakers and handsets, moderate 
in terms of complexity, and accommodates effective and simple built-in 
transmission error detection schemes. Such devices are commonly 
referred to as "codecs" for coder/decoder. The invention has particular 
application in digital cellular networks but may be advantageously used 
in any product line that requires speech compression for 
communications. Cellular telecommunications systems in North America are 
evolving from their current analog frequency modulated (FM) form 
towards digital systems. A standard that uses a full rate 8.0 Kbps vector 
sum excited linear prediction (VSELP) speech coder, convolutional 
coding for error protection, differential quadrature phase shift keying 
(QPSK) modulations, and a time division, multiple access (TDMA)  
 
scheme has been adopted by the Telecommunication Industry Association 
(TIA). This is expected to triple the traffic carrying capacity of the 
cellular systems. In order to further increase its capacity by a factor of 
two, the TIA has begun the process of evaluating and subsequently 
selecting a half rate codec. For the purposes of the TIA technology 
assessment, the half rate codec along with its error protection should 
have an overall bit rate of 6.4 Kbps and is restrict to a frame size of 
40 ms. The codec is expected to have a voice quality comparable to the 
full rate standard over a wide variety of conditions. These conditions 
include various speakers, influence of handsets, background noise, and 
channel conditions. Codebook Excited Linear Prediction (CELP) is a technique for 
low rate speech coding. The basic technique consists of searching a 
codebook of randomly distributed excitation vectors for that vector which 
produces an output sequence (when filtered through pitch and linear 
predictive coding (LPC) short-term synthesis filters) that is closest to the 
input sequence. To accomplish this task, all of the candidate excitation 
vectors in the codebook must be filtered with both the pitch and LPC 
synthesis filters to produce a candidate output sequence that can then be 
compared to the input sequence. This makes CELP a very 
computationally-intensive algorithm, with typical codebooks consisting of
