<ABSTRACT>
A compact, power-sparing detector (16) for detecting heart polarizations 
is described. The detector (16) comprises a first operational 

amplifier (20) which uses sensed heart signals from a 
heart (18) as an input signal. By means of feedback coupling via 

a second operational amplifier (22), a resistor (24) and a capacitor 
(26), the system strives to achieve a minimum voltage 

gradient across the first operational amplifier's (20) input terminals. 
When an electrical signal with a signal slope corresponding 

to a heart depolarization arrives at the input terminal of 
the first operational amplifier (20), the second operational amplifier 

(22) is no longer able to damp out the input signal, and 
a peak output signal is sent from the first operational amplifier 

to a first comparator (28) and a second comparator (30) respectively. 
The comparators (28, 30) produce an output signal as long 

as the output signal from the first operational amplifier (20) is 
maximal, and the output signal from the comparators (28, 30) is 

integrated in a time integrator (32) in order to determine the 
duration of the output signals. When a adequate duration is 

achieved, a detection signal is generated at the output terminal 
(34).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a detector for detecting heart
depolarizations by sensing a heart's electrical signals.Reliable detection of spontaneous heart depolarizations is important
in the monitoring and treatment of a heart. One known way of
detecting heart depolarizations is to record the heart's electrical
signals (ECG signals) and identify same. A special effort is
then made to identify the QRS complex, appearing when the ventricles
depolarize, which displays very characteristic, fast intrinsic
deflection, i.e. rapid changes in the signal. Detection
can be identified by analysis of the signal's change (derivative)
and duration. This is described in e.g. US-A-4,417,306.Power consumption is a problem when detectors are implemented in
implantable pacemakers and defibrillators (ICD). An implantable
apparatus only has access to the limited amount of energy stored
in its battery, and a detector, which should be active most of
the time in order to detect heart depolarizations, must not consume
too much power.Space is another problem with implantable devices. Pacemaker and
defibrillator designs are becoming increasingly smaller. So components
used in such devices must take up as little space as possible.One object of the invention is to achieve a detector which solves
the aforesaid problems.One such detector is achieved in accordance with the invention in 
that the detector comprises an operational amplifier with input
terminals for receiving the heart's electrical signals sensed
by an electrode system, by the operational amplifier being feedback
coupled by a ragulatory circuit in order to minimize the voltage
gradient between the operational amplifier's input terminals as
long as the electrical signals have a flatter slope than a programmable
signal slope, whereby an electrical signal with a
steeper signal slope than the predetermined signal slope gives
rise to a peak positive or negative output signal from the operational
amplifier, depending on whether the signal slope is positive
or negative, and a time-sensing circuit in which a time interval
during which at least the positive or the negative output
signal from the operational amplifier is maximal, whereby a heart
depolarization being detected when said integrated time interval exceeds
a predetermined detection time.Components are utilized which can advantageously be arrayed on a
microchip and, thus, take up very little space. The components
are also very power-sparing. As long as the slope of the voltage
signal at the detector's input terminal
