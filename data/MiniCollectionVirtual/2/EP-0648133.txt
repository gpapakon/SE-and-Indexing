<ABSTRACT>
Methods and compositions comprising polyfunctional biowaste treatment complexes for treating biowastes in a manner which: (a) keeps noxious and toxic substances from being released from the biowaste, and (b) neutralizes such substances released during the course of stabilizing the biowaste. Reduction of the biowaste volume, potentiation of the recovery of materials of value from the biowaste and other advantages may also be obtained by use of appropriate constituents in the complex.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates
to novel methods for stabilizing biowastes and to the
use of polyfunctional complexes for accomplishing this
objective.These methods and the use of the complexes as just characterized shall
simplify the treatment of biowastes; make safer,
protect and improve the environment; and increase
processing capacity and potential and conserved values
of processed biowastes as end products.Disposing of and effectively treating biowastes
is an increasingly difficult problem.The abundant open dumping space of yesterday is
now probably someone's backyard. The sites now left
are surrounded by someone's air, living, and working
spaces and located above someone's drinking water.
Everyone, it seems, wants waste in someone else's back
yard.Earth's capacity to absorb and civilization's
ability to ignore waste behind a defense of rhetoric
rather than action is very nearly at an end.The axioms, sometimes self-serving, sometimes
in hysterical response, that "dilution is the solution
to pollution" and at the other extreme -- "compaction
is the action of satisfaction" -- are foundations of
heretofore employed waste management techniques. 
These approaches completely fail to take into consideration
the simple fact that the problem of waste is
not going to go away on its own accord. Endlessly
diluting, compacting, transporting, storing, transmutating
or apportioning waste to air, earth and water
merely prolongs but makes more certain the ultimate
reckoning.One widely employed solution to the waste
disposal problem is incineration of the offending
material; another is controlled disposal and/or
treatment of the waste in a digester, sanitary landfill,
lagoon, compost pile, or the like.Incineration is of limited value. Capital
costs of the equipment required to incinerate all of
the wastes generated in a metropolitan or other
populous area is prohibitive. Los Angeles, as one
example, is reported to generate 500,000 tons of solid
waste daily. Incineration is also only a partial
solution because non-combustible solids must often be
sorted out and otherwise disposed of prior to incineration.
Furthermore, the complex and noxious emissions
generated by incineration are difficult and expensive
to control; and the solids generated in an incinerator
(and often in an incinerator's stack gas scrubber) are
wastes that must be transported to a landfill or other
disposal site and stored. The location of acceptable
sites for incinerators -- especially those intended to
accommodate body parts and other perhaps
