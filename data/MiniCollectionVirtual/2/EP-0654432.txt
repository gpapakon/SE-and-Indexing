<ABSTRACT>
An apparatus for overturning a long-web roll (1) 
comprises chucks (2) for holding the long-web roll (1), which is 

placed on a first resting surface (15), by nipping an outer 
circumference of the long-web roll (1) from both sides in the 

radial direction, and stop plates (3) capable of being set at 
supporting positions that stand facing a front end face (1a) 

of the long-web roll (1), which is held by the chucks (2), the 
front end face (1a) being directed towards the side of a 

second resting surface (18). A rotating transfer device (10,12,13,22) 
rotates the stop plates (3) and the chucks (2) together with each 

other by an angle of approximately 90° and thereby places 
the long-web roll (1), which is held by the chucks (2), on the 

second resting surface (18) such that the front end face (1a) may 
rest on the second resting surface (18). After the rotating 

transfer device (10,12,13,22) begins operating, a device (6,16,20) 
moves the 

chucks (2) with respect to the stop plates (3), which are set at 
the supporting positions, in the direction along the 

wind-up axis (C) of the long-web roll (1) and thereby brings the 
front end face (1a) of the long-web roll (1) into contact with the 

stop plates (3).

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to an apparatus for
overturning a long-web roll according to the preamble of claim 1.An apparatus according to the preamble of claim 1 is known from
US-A-2 207 893.As described in, for example, Japanese
Unexamined Patent Publication No. 4(1992)-112172, long
webs of photographic materials, and the like, are
ordinarily wound up into rolls and dealt with in the form
of the rolls. In many cases, the long web of this type
is wound up in a wind-up apparatus into a roll such that
the wind-up axis of the roll may be approximately
horizontal. The tail end of the long web is then secured
to the long-web roll. When the long-web roll is conveyed
to the next process, in general, the long-web roll is
conveyed by a conveyor in a stable orientation such that
the wind-up axis of the long-web roll may be
approximately vertical. Therefore, it is necessary to
utilize an apparatus for overturning the long-web roll
from the state, in which the wind-up axis of the long-web
roll is approximately horizontal, to the state, in which
the wind-up axis is approximately vertical. As one of apparatuses for overturning a long-web
roll, an apparatus shown in Figures 10A, 10B, 10C,
and 10D has heretofore been known wherein two belt
conveyors 51 and 52 are combined with each other such
that they may be normal to each other. The belt
conveyors 51 and 52 can be rotated by an angle of 90°
around a rotation shaft 53. With the illustrated
conventional apparatus, a long-web roll 56 is placed on a
belt conveyor 54 in an orientation such that a wind-up
axis C of the long-web roll 56 may be approximately
horizontal. As illustrated in Figure 10A, the long-web
roll 56, which has thus been conveyed by the belt
conveyor 54, is received by the belt conveyor 51. As
illustrated in Figure 10B, the long-web roll 56 is
conveyed by the belt conveyor 51 to the position that is
in contact with the belt conveyor 52. Thereafter, as
illustrated in Figure 10C, the belt conveyors 51 and 52
are rotated around the rotation shaft 53, and the long-web
roll 56 is thereby overturned to the orientation such
that the wind-up axis C may be approximately vertical.
As illustrated in Figure 10D, the belt conveyor 52 is
then driven in order to deliver the long-web roll 56 onto
a belt conveyor 55. An apparatus similar to the one described
above is known from US-A-3 884 362.With the conventional apparatus described
above, the overturning operation cannot be begun
immediately after the long-web roll 56 is received by the
belt conveyor 51. The overturning

<CLAIMS>
An apparatus for overturning a long-web roll, wherein
a long-web roll (1), into which a long web has been

wound up and which is placed on a first resting
surface in a state such that a wind-up axis of the

long-web roll is approximately parallel to the first
resting surface, is transferred onto a second resting

surface, wherein said long-web roll is overturned to
a state in which the wind-up axis is orthogonal to

said second resting surface, the apparatus comprising:

a supporting means (3) capable of being set at a
supporting position that stands facing a front end

face of the long-web roll when said long-web roll is
positioned on said first resting surface and
a rotating transfer means (13, 12, 10, 22) for
rotating said supporting means (3) and said long-web

roll (1) by an angle of approximately 90° thereby
placing the long-web roll on the second resting

surface such that said front end face rests on the
second resting surface,
characterized by
a chucking means (2) for holding the long-web roll,
which is placed on the first resting surface, by

nipping an outer circumference of the long-web roll
from both sides in the radial direction, and 
a means for moving said chucking means with respect
to said supporting means (3), which is set at said

supporting position, in the direction along the wind-up
axis of the long-web roll after said rotating

transfer means begins operating, and thereby bringing
said front end face of the long-web roll into contact

with said supporting means (3), wherein said rotating
transfer means rotates said
 supporting means together
with said chucking means, while said long-web roll is

hold by said chucking means.
An apparatus as defined in claim 1 wherein said
supporting means comprises a pair of members (2),

which stand facing opposite peripheral regions of
said front end face of the long-web roll (1) when

said supporting means (2) is set at said supporting
position, and the pair of said members of said

supporting means, which is set at said supporting
position, come to positions on the sides outward from

the second resting surface (18) and do not interfere
with the second resting surface when the long-web

roll is placed on the second resting surface.
An apparatus as defined in claim 1 wherein said long-web
roll (1) comprises a photographic material as the

web.
An apparatus as defined in claim 1 wherein the first
resting surface is an upper surface of a first

conveyor (15).
An apparatus as defined in claim 1 wherein the second
resting surface is an upper surface of a second

conveyor (18).
