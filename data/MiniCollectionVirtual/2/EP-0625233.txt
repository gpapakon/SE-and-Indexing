<ABSTRACT>
A wood/concrete composite floor which simply and therefore cheaply solves the problem of shearing load transfer between the wood and the concrete. The floor includes a set of beams (1) on supports connected to a concrete slab (3). The connection between the wood and the concrete is provided by plates with metal spikes (2) such as those used as connectors in framing construction. The plates (2) are partially embedded in the beams and partially embedded into the concrete. The formwork panels (4) may be left to form a French-style ceiling, or they may be withdrawn and a ceiling attached to the beams (1). In a preferred embodiment, light cellular concrete with a mass per unit volume of around 1400 kg/m

 is used.
