<ABSTRACT>
In the case of a load-bearing structure for an aerodynamic surface on an aircraft, consisting of at least two spars, a plurality of ribs consisting of rib elements, and two shells which consist of a plurality of shell elements, the ribs extending in the direction of the profile depth of the load-bearing structure, and the longitudinal extent of the spars and shells corresponding approximately to the span width of the load-bearing structure, the invention comprises the shells and ribs being divided in the direction of the profile depth, with approximately the same pitch, into a plurality of shell elements 24, 25, 34, 35 and rib elements 26a, 26b, 36a, 36b, and the load-bearing structure being formed from a plurality of structure elements 21, 22 which each consist of a spar 5 to 9, two shell elements 24, 25, 34, 35 and a plurality of rib elements 26a, 26b, 36a, 36b, and the structure elements 21, 22 being interleaved with one another such that a subsequent structure element 21, 22 is inserted into a preceding structure element 21, 22. In this case, it is particularly advantageous that the load-bearing structure can be produced without any problems even if the surface has a small profile thickness and a relatively large profile depth, and that a solution having a honeycomb core is avoided.

Supporting structure for an aerodynamic surface on an 
aircraft, consisting of at least two spars, a plurality of 

ribs consisting of rib elements and two shells consisting of a 
plurality of shell elements (24, 25, 34, 35), wherein the ribs 

extend in the direction of the depth of the section of the 
supporting structure and the longitudinal extent of the spars 

and shells corresponds approximately to the span of the 
supporting structure, wherein the shells and ribs are divided 

in the direction of the depth of the section with 
approximately the same spacing into a plurality of shell 

elements (24, 25, 34, 35) or rib elements (10a, 10b, 10, 26-30, 
36-40) respectively and the supporting structure is formed 

of a plurality of structure elements (21, 22, 81, 82, 83, 84) 
which each consist of a spar (5-8, 18, 20, 23, 33, 64-69), two 

shell elements (24, 25, 34, 35) and a plurality of rib 
elements (10a, 10b, 10, 26-30, 36-40) and the structure 

elements (21, 22, 81, 82, 83, 84) are nested with one another 
so that a succeeding structure element (21, 22, 81, 82, 83, 

84) is fitted into a preceding structure element (21, 22, 81, 
82, 83, 84), characterised in that the individual rib elements 

(10a, 10b, 10, 26-30, 36-40) are divided into two halves (26a, 
26b, 36a, 36b, 10d, 10e, 10f, 10g, 10h, 10i) in the direction 

of the depth of the section and the shell elements (24, 25, 
34, 35) have on their long edges on the spar side spar flanges 

(44, 49, 49a, 60, 60a) which rest plane parallel on the spar 
(5-8, 18, 20, 23, 33, 64-69) and are riveted thereto. 
Supporting structure according to Claim 1, characterised 
in that the spars (64 to 69) extend in a convergent 

arrangement. 
Supporting structure according to Claim 1 or 2, 
characterised in that the ribs (73 to 79) extend like 

traverses.  
 
Supporting structure according to one of Claims 1 to 3, 
characterised in that the length and the number of the rib 

elements of a structure element (80 to 84) are independent of 
the length and the number of the rib elements of the structure 

element (80 to 84) preceding it in each case.
