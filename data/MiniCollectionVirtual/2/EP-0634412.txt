<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to novel piperidine compounds, to their use as light stabilizers, 
heat stabilizers and oxidation stabilizers for organic materials, in particular synthetic 
polymers, and to the organic materials thus stabilized. US-A-4 883 831 and US-A-4 883 860 claim the stabilization of synthetic polymers with 
certain piperidine esters of triazinylamino acids. In US-A-4 102 858, certain piperidine esters of aspartic acid are reported as stabilizers for 
synthetic polymers. The present invention relates to novel compounds of the formula (I)
