<ABSTRACT>
In the method and apparatus for analyzing contaminative 
element concentrations, a fluorescent X-ray generated by 

elements when an X-ray is total reflected from the surface 
of a substrate is detected by a fluorescent X-ray detector 

(46); a peak of the fluorescent X-ray generated by a 
substrate element and peaks of the fluorescent X-ray 

generated by other contaminative elements are separated 
from the detected fluorescent X-ray waveform by a peak 

separating circuit (11); and the concentrations of the 
detected contaminative elements are calculated on the basis 

of the separated peaks by a calculating circuit (12, 13). 
In the peak detection, in particular, the peaks of 
the 
contaminative elements to be analyzed are detected from the 

waveform. When other peaks are present within a predetermined 
number of channels (energy eV) before and after each 

detected peak, the channel numbers and the signal intensities 
between the respective peaks are extracted. Further, 

the a true peak is determined after obtaining the evaluation 
values of the respective peaks, so that it is possible 

to separate peaks from the fluorescent X-ray waveform 
accurately, even if each peak is split in the observed 

waveform.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method and an
apparatus for analyzing contaminative element concentrations,
and more specifically to a method and an apparatus for
measuring contaminative element concentrations on a
semiconductor substrate, for instance with the use of an
energy dispersive type total reflection X-ray fluorescence
analysis.Conventionally, as a non-destructive contaminative
element concentration analyzing apparatus, there is so far
known a total reflection X-ray fluorescence analysis (See
"Inspection, Analysis and Measurement Technology Required
16M/64M Integration or After", by Ayako SIMAZAKI, Kunihiro
MIYAZAKI; NIKKEI NICRODEVICE, No. 86, pages 148, 154, 156 and
158, August, 1992). Furthermore, as a contaminative element
concentration analyzing apparatus based upon total reflection
X-ray fluorescence analysis, an energy or wavelength
dispersive type apparatus is known. Since the contaminative
element concentrations can be analyzed non-destructively with
the use of the contaminative element concentration analyzer
based upon the total reflection X-ray fluorescence analysis,
it has become possible to manage the contamination of silicon
wafer during the semiconductor manufacturing process, and
thereby the contamination of wafer can be reduced effectively.Fig. 4 is a conceptual block diagram showing an example
of the contaminative element concentration analyzer using the
energy dispersive type total reflecting X-ray fluorescence
analysis.In Fig. 4, a sample base 42 is mounted within a vacuum 
chamber 41, and a sample (e.g., silicon water) 43 is mounted
on this sample base 42. An X-ray generated by a rotating
target type X-ray source 44 is converted to a monochromatic ray
through a monochromator 45, being passed through a slit 49,
and then allowed to be incident upon the sample 43 at a small
total-reflection angle. On the basis of this incident X-ray, a
fluorescent X-ray can be generated from the surface of the
sample 43. The generated fluorescent X-ray is detected by a
detector 46 (e.g., semiconductor detector), and converted into
electric signals corresponding thereto. The fluorescent X-ray
signals detected as described above are processed by a pulse
processor 47 to obtain an observed waveform as shown in Fig.
5. In Fig. 5, the abscissa designates the energy of the
detected fluorescent X-ray and the ordinate designates the
signal intensity (relative intensity according to the number
of photons incident upon the detector 46) of the detected
fluorescent X-ray. Fig. 5 indicates that the
