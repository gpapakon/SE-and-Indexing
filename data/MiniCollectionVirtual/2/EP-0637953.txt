<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an absorbent body
which is intended to form the absorbent element of an
absorbent article, such as a diaper, an incontinence
guard or a sanitary napkin, and includes a first
absorbent layer which is based on cellulose fluff-pulp
and which is intended to face towards the wearer in
use,i.e to lie proximal to the wearer, and a second
absorbent layer which is also based on cellulose
fluff-pulp and which is intended to lie distal from
the wearer in use, i.e. to face away from the wearer,
and which has a high liquid-dispersion capability.An absorbent body, or pad, intended for absorbent
articles such as disposable diapers, sanitary napkins
and incontinence guards is normally formed of one or
more layers of cellulose fluff-pulp and often contains
so-called superabsorbents, which are polymers that are
capable of absorbing several times their own weight of
water or body liquid. The absorbent body may also
include other constituents, for instance constituents
which improve its liquid-dispersing properties or
which increase its ability to hold together and its
ability to resist deformation in use.One serious problem, primarily encountered with diapers
and incontinence guards which are intended to
receive and absorb relatively large quantities of
liquid, is that the articles often begin to leak
before their total absorption capacity has been utilized
to the full.Although the use of superabsorbents in absorbent 
bodies will impart thereto a high absorption capacity
and also improve their ability to retain the liquid
absorbed, even when the absorbent body is subjected to
external pressure forces, present-day superabsorbents
have a low absorption rate. Since urination often
results in the discharge of large quantities of liquid
in the course of some few seconds, the absorbent body
will often become temporarily saturated with liquid in
local areas, such that further urine discharged by the
wearer will leak from the absorbent body.This premature leakage is, of course, highly irritating
to the wearer and also to his/her medic.Another problem encountered with absorbent sanitary
articles of the aforedescribed kind is one of keeping
the surface of the article which lies against the
wearer in use as dry as possible during the whole of
its use period and to prevent so-called rewetting,
i.e. to prevent liquid that has already been absorbed
being pressed back out of the absorbent pad and rewetting
the wearer's skin or giving rise to leakage.
The rewetting properties of an absorbent article are

<CLAIMS>
An absorbent body which is intended to form the absorbent element of an absorbent
article, such as a diaper, an incontinence guard or a sanitary napkin and which includes

a first fibre-based absorbent layer which is intended to lie proximal to the wearer in
use, and a second fibre-based absorbent layer which is intended to lie distal to the

wearer in use, this second layer exhibiting a high liquid-dispersing ability,

characterized
 by the combination that the first layer (16) includes a
superabsorbent material (18) of high gel-strength having the ability to swell

substantially uneffected by normally occurring pressure forces, which is admixed
essentially uniformly in the fibre material within at least one area of the layer, and that

the second layer (17) includes at least one layer (20) of superabsorbent material
disposed between fibre layers (17a, 17b).
An absorbent body according to Claim 1, 
characterized
 in that the first layer
(16) has a low liquid-dispersing ability.
An absorbent body according to Claim 1 or 2, 
characterized
 in that the
superabsorbent material (20) in the second layer (17) has high gel-strength.
An absorbent body according to one or more of the preceding Claims,

characterized
 in that the major part of the fibre material in the first layer (16)
is comprised of fluff-pulp having an open fibre structure and a critical bulk above

8 cm
3
/g at 2.5 kPa; and in that the fibre material in the second layer (17) in at least the
first fibre layer (17a) of said second layer (17) lying proximal to the first layer (16) is

comprised mainly of another type of fluff-pulp having a critical bulk beneath 8
cm
3
/g at 2.5 kPa and has a higher liquid-dispersing ability 
than the fluff-pulp in the first layer (16).
An absorbent body according to Claim 4,

characterized
 in that the first layer
(16) is comprised mainly of a fluff-pulp having a

fibre weight between 180 and 600 mg/km; and in that at
least the first fluff-pulp layer (17a) of the second

layer (17) is comprised mainly of a fluff-pulp having
a fibre weight between 140 and 190 mg/km.
An absorbent body according to Claim 5,

characterized
 in that the first layer
(16) is comprised mainly of a chemi-thermomechanical

fluff-pulp; and in that at least 60% of the first
fluff-pulp layer (17a) of the second layer (17) is

comprised of a chemical fluff-pulp.
An absorbent body according to one or more of the
preceding Claims, 
characterized
 in that
the first layer (16) contains between 2 and 30%,

preferably between 2 and 15% superabsorbent material
calculated on the total dry weight of the layer.
An absorbent body according to one or more of the
preceding Claims, 
characterized
 in that
the proportion of superabsorbent material in the

second layer (17) is between 2 and 60%, preferably
between 10 and 50%, calculated on the total dry weight

of the layer in the area or areas of the layer (17) in
which the superabsorbent material is distributed.
A diaper containing an absorbent body enclosed in
a casing (1, 2), and having a back part (4) which is

intended to be placed rearwardly on a wearer in use, a
front part (5) which is intended to be placed forwardly

on the wearer in use, and a crotch part which
extends between the back part (4) and the front part

(5) and which is intended to be placed in the crotch
region of the wearer in use, between the thighs thereof, 


characterized
 in that as seen from
the side of the diaper proximal to the wearer in use,

the absorbent body (3) includes a first fibre-based
absorbent layer (16) and a second fibre-based absorbent

layer (17) which exhibits a high liquid-dispersing
ability, wherein the first absorbent layer (16)

includes a superabsorbent material (18) of high gel-strength
having the ability to swell substantially uneffected by normally occurring

pressure forces, mixed essentially uniformly in the fibre
material within at least one area of the layer, and

the second layer (17) includes at least one layer (20)
of superabsorbent material disposed between fibre layers (17a, 17b).
A diaper according to Claim 9, 
charac-terized

in that the first absorbent layer (16)
extends over only a part of the surface area of the

second absorbent layer (17), wherein the first absorbent
layer (16) is located essentially in the crotch

part (6) of the diaper.
