<ABSTRACT>
The present invention provides a simplified process for converting unsaturated ketones having from 6 to about 24 carbon atoms into the corresponding saturated ketones comprising forming an aqueous mixture of the unsaturated ketone and at least about 50 % by weight water and heating the mixture under autogeneous pressure at a temperature of from about 200 to 450  C, more preferably from about 250  C up to the critical temperature of water which is abou 374  C. Heating is continued for a period of time sufficient to convert at least about 20 % by weight of the unsaturated ketone, usually from about 5 up to about 120 minutes, depending on temperature, the amount of water present and the identity of the starting ketone feedstock. The process may be characterized as an aquathermolysis reaction wherein the reaction proceeds in water primarily through ionic routes rather than through free radical routes. Accordingly, relatively high conversion rates and good yields of saturated ketone and other reaction by-products may be obtained without the necessity of using a catalyst in the process.

<DESCRIPTION>
 AOUATHERMOLYTIC CLEAVAGE OF UNSATURATED KETONESThis application is related to copending application Serial No. 07/852,438, filed March 16, 1992 which is a Continuation-In-Part of application Serial No. 07/411,121, filed September 22, 1989, now abandoned.BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTIONField of the InventionThe present invention relates to a process for cleaving unsaturated ketones to saturated ketones of lower molecular weight by aquathermolysis chemistry.Description of Related ArtUnsaturated ketones such as mesityl oxide and phorone are considered to be higher value materials with varied uses such as solvents, paint formulations, insect repellents and intermediates for organic synthesis. However, many unsaturated ketones are formed as by-products during the synthesis of simpler saturated ketones or aldehydes and, as such, constitute impurities of little commercial value which must be separated out of the reaction mixture and disposed of. For example, aldol condensation of methyl ethyl ketone (MEK) formed during the zinc oxide-catalyzed oxidation of 

sec-butyl alcohol leads to the formation of alpha, beta unsaturated keto dimers (and higher oligomers) which may concentrate in the MEK distillation residue at levels of up to 50% by weight. Of this amount, approximately 45% by weight constitutes unsaturated C8 ketones and the balance comprises a mixture of higher ketones, saturated ketones and olefins. The presence of these materials in reactor heavies severely restricts the further application of such heavier residuums for uses such as motor fuels or further refining. In addition, the added costs associated with separation of these materials severely detracts from overall process efficiency and economics. Accordingly, such bottoms are usually disposed of by burning.It is known in the prior art that unsaturated ketones such as mesityl oxide or pulegone can be converted to the corresponding saturated ketone, e.g., acetone, by a hydrolysis reaction promoted using a catalyst. For Example, U.S. Patent 4,766,249 discloses the hydrolysis of an unsaturated carbonyl compound of the formula R'R"C=R to produce a carbonyl-containing compound of the formula R'-CO-R" and H2R, by conducting the hydrolysis under reflux conditions in the presence of a catalytic amount of hydroxide ion and at a pH of 11-13. Specifically claimed is the hydrolysis of pulegone to yield a mixture of acetone and 3- methylcyclohexanone.Japanese patent document JP 54/70,210 discloses the preparation of acetone from mesityl oxide by
