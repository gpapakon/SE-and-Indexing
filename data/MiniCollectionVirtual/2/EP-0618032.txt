<ABSTRACT>
A device for machining the corner joints of frames (3), in particular window or door frames, welded from profile pieces. It has at least one machining unit (1, 2) pivotable about an axis (6) perpendicular to the mounting plane (7) of the frame (3) to be machined. The machining unit (1, 2) is arranged on a slide (9) traversable at least in a direction perpendicular to the pivot axis (6) from a retracted initial position into a machining position at the frame (3). The slide (9) has two tool carriers (12, 13) for the cutting tools (14 to 17). The tool carriers (12, 13) are arranged at a distance from one another and in the machining position at least partly overlap the frame corner to be machined at the side. In order to permit simple and quick machining of frames of small width, provision is made for at least one of the two tool carriers (12, 13) to be held on the slide (9) in such a way as to be displaceable in the at least one traverse direction of the slide (9) and for it to be traversable together with the slide but to stop in its position relative to the slide (9) from a certain predetermined traverse in the direction of the machining position.

Device for the treatment of corner joints of frames (3), in 
particular of window or door frames, welded together from profile 

section members, with at least one treatment unit (1, 2), which is 
pivotable about an axle (6) perpendicular to the plane (7) of reception 

of the frame (3) to be treated and which is arranged at a carriage (9), 
which is movable from a retracted initial setting into a treatment 

setting at the frame (3) at least in direction perpendicular to the 
pivot axle (6) and which displays two tool carriers (12, 13), which are 

arranged at a spacing one from the other and laterally overlap at least 
partially the frame corner to be treated in the treatment setting, for 

the treatment tools (14 to 17), characterised thereby, that at least one 
of both the tool carriers (12, 13) is retained at the carriage (9) to be 

displaceable in the at least one direction of movement of the carriage 
(9) and movable together with the carriage (9), but persists in its 

setting relative to the carriage (9) after a preset movement travel in 
the d
irection of the treatment setting. 
Device according to claim 1, characterised thereby, that a spring 
force storage device (19) is provided, which bears on the carriage (9), 

which is preferably movable biaxially, and acts on the displaceable tool 
carrier (13) in the direction of its normal setting at the carriage (9). 
Device according to claim 2, characterised thereby, that the spring 
force storage device is formed as pneumatic or hydraulic spring force 

element, preferably as compression spring (19). 
Device according to claim 2 or 3, characterised thereby, that the 
spring force storage device (19) bears against a counterbearing (20) 

arranged at the carriage (9) and engages at an abutment (21) arranged, 
in a given case to be settable at the displaceable tool carrier (13).  

 
Device according to claim 4, characterised thereby, that the 
abutment (21) at the displaceable tool carrier (13) in the normal 

setting thereof lies against a counterabutment (22), which in a given 
case is settable, of the carriage (9). 
Device according to one of the claims 1 to 5, characterised thereby, 
that a treatment tool, such as for example a milling tool (17), provided 

for the treatment of the outer corner of the frame is retained at the 
tool carrier (12) arranged stationarily at the carriage (9). 
Device according to one of the claims 1 to 6, characterised thereby, 
that the displaceable tool carrier (13) at its free end displays at 

least one rolling or sliding element (18) for rolling or sliding along 
a component of the device such as, for example, along the sleeve part 

(25), which surrounds the pivot axle (6), of the carriage carrier part 
(8) during a movement of the carriage (9) in a direction parallel to the 

pivot axle (6). 
Device according to one of the claims 1 to 7, characterised thereby, 
that the pivot axle (6) starting out from a mounting point of the device 

extends at most to the height of the plane (7) of reception for the frame 
(3), wherein the displaceable tool carrier (13) is arranged to lie next 

to the pivot axle (6). 
Device according to one of the claims 1 to 8, characterised thereby, 
that it is constructed for a substantially horizontal treatment of the 

frame (3) with substantially vertically oriented pivot axle (6), wherein 
the upper tool carrier (12) is arranged to be stationary at the carriage 

(9) and the lower tool carrier (13) is arranged to be displaceable at 
the carriage (9). 
Device according to one of the claims 1 to 9, characterised by at 
least two treatment units (1, 2) laterally of a conveying track for the 

frame (3), which units are movable one relative to the other relative to 
the conveying track.
