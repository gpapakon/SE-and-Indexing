<ABSTRACT>
A video decoder with a control unit (CC), a frame store (P) and a loop filter (F) for decoding coded video frames (q) block by block is described. The block-by-block decoding usually leads to artefacts during the reproduction of the decoded video frames on a monitor (M), which can be largely suppressed by filters following the decoder. An also extensive suppression of the artefacts with little circuit complexity is characterised by means  by which the control unit (CC) is enabled, in the decoding gaps,   - to read out predetermined pixel data of a decoded video frame from the frame buffer (P) and to supply these pixels to the loop filter (F) for filtering - to select the predetermined pixel data in such a manner that the filtering is carried out via the block edges of the blocks provided during the decoding.   The intended measures are compatible with a decoder according to Recommendation H.261.

<CLAIMS>
A video decoder comprising a control unit (CC), a picture memory (P) and a
loop filter (F) for blockwise decoding of coded video pictures (q), in which the control unit

(CC) is used for controlling a blockwise filtering operation of predetermined, read pixel
data by means of a loop filter (F), characterized in that a decoded video picture is post-processed,

in which a filtering operation is performed by means of the same loop filter (F)
via the block edges of the blocks provided for decoding.
A video decoder as claimed in claim 1, characterized by means with which
the control unit (CC) is enabled to filter the predetermined pixel data b
etween decoding
operations of two video pictures (q).
A video decoder as claimed in claim 1 or 2, characterized in that the
predetermined pixel data are the data of picture sections whose geometrical dimensions

correspond to those of the blocks provided for decoding, but whose geometrical positions
are offset vertically and horizontally with respect to the positions of said blocks.
A video decoder as claimed in claim 3, characterized in that the offset covers
half a block edge length.
A video decoder as claimed in any one of the preceding claims,
characterized by means enabling the control unit (CC) to activate the loop filter (F) only for

those pixels which are peripheral pixels of the blocks provided for decoding.
