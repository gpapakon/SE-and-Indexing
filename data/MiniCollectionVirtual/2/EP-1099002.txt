<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to the field of electron beam technologies of production on a metal substrate of functionally gradient protective coatings with the outer ceramic layer or metal-ceramic layer by evaporation and subsequent condensation at moderate temperatures of the substrate (300 to 500  DEG C) of mixtures of metals and metal oxides having different melting temperature and vapour pressure at the evaporation temperature. To achieve a high strength of adhesion of the coating to the substrate at moderate temperatures (300 to 500  DEG C) and high hardness the proposed composition contains Sn and Cr as metals, and Al2O3 and Cr2O3 as metal oxides. To improve the adhesion strength and hardness of the coating A1 and MgO can be further added to the composition.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to the field of electron beam technology of producing on a
metal substrate the functionally-gradient protective coatings with the outer ceramic or
metal-ceramic layer by evaporation and subsequent condensation with moderate
substrate temperatures (300 to 500Â°C) of mixtures of metals, alloys and oxides having
different melting temperature and vapour pressure at the evaporation temperature. In
particular, the invention relates to the field of protective coatings on parts of titanium
alloys used in gas turbines, and more specifically to a composition for production of a
protective gradient coating on a metal substrate.It is known that a weak link in the substrate/coating system is the flat interface
between them. The difference in the physico-mechanical properties of the substrate and
the coating, primarily of the thermal factors of linear expansion and the Young's
modulus, as well as the irreversible reactions, for instance, oxidation, on the interface
during operation, lead to premature failure of the coating and deterioration of the item
performance.In this connection over the last 5 to 10 years, the coatings were perfected by
development of a certain (functional) gradient of the composition and structure in the
direction from the substrate to the coating upper layers. This problem is especially
urgent for protective coatings with the external ceramic layer of oxide ceramics
deposited onto metal surfaces.By now a new direction of material science has already formed in the field of
protective coatings,namely the functionally gradient protective coatings (MRS Bulletin
v.20, No.1, 1995). This area is based primarily on up-to-date technologies of air plasma
spraying (APS), vacuum-plasma spraying (VPS, LPPS) and electron beam vapour
deposition of coatings under vacuum (EB-PVD). Used here are both spraying of
individual coating components from several sources and of complex compositions
which predetermine the protective coating composition, from one source.For instance, in the US patent No. 4,248,940 of 03.02.81 (G.Goward, et al), the
gradient coating with the external ceramic layer of ZrO2 - Y2O3 and ZrO2 - MgO oxide 
ceramics is produced with two independent sources of air plasma by spraying by a
certain program a powder of the high-temperature alloy (15-40)%Cr-(10-15)%Al-(0.01-1.0)%Y,
the balance being Ni-Co alloy and the powder of the above ceramics.Also known are the NiCr|(ZrO2-8%Y2O3) and Ni|Al2O3 gradient coatings
produced with LLPS by spraying from one source of compositions of a
