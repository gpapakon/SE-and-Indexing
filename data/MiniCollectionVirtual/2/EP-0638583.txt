<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to compounds composed of an aminosugar, 
a linker and a carrier molecule, to their preparation 
and use as pharmaceuticals. EP Application No. 93118511.0 describes antibiotics, 
called salmycins, which are composed of an iron chelate 
(siderophore), a monosaccharide and an aminomonosaccharide. 
The structure of the salmycins is represented 
in the following formula. 
Salmycin A:R = NOH,R'' = -(CH₂)₅-OH, Salmycin B:R = O,R'' = -(CH₂)₅-OH, Salmycin C:R = O,R'' = -(CH₂)₄-OH, Salmycin D:R = NOH,R'' = -(CH₂)₄-OH. Found as constituent of iron-containing antibiotics are 
hydroxamatoiron(III) complexes or chelates of catechol 
derivatives. These iron complexes are called siderophores. 
The siderophores are reviewed by B.F. Matzanke et  
 
al. in "Iron carriers and iron proteins", Th.M. Loehr 
(Ed.), VCH Publishers, 1989, pages 1-121. Siderophores 
are used by bacteria to transport iron into the cell. The 
cell membrane has various specific types of gates for 
active transport of substances. Examples of bacterial 
transport systems are to be found in: H. Zähner, Angew. 
Chem. 89 (1977) 696-703. Some of these transport systems 
are a component of naturally occurring antibiotics, with 
whose aid the antibiotics get into the bacterial cell. On 
the basis of these findings there have been attempts to 
obtain artificial antibiotics by combining a transport 
system with an active substance. Thus, H. Zähner et al. 
(The Japanese Journal of Antibiotics, Vol. XXX Suppl. 
(1977) S-201) describe the chemical coupling of a ferrioxaminyl 
B or a ferricrocinyl radical, both of which are 
siderophores, to sulfonamides. A. Brochu et al. 
(Antimicrobial Agents and Chemotherapy 36 (1992) 
2166-2175) combine certain siderophores with cephalosporins. 
The linkage of a carrier system to an active 
substance frequently leads to compounds without 
antibiotic activity. It has now been found, surprisingly, that replacement of 
the iron chelate component in salmycins A-D by another 
siderophore leads to compounds which have antibiotic 
effects. Besides the replacement of the iron chelate component in 
the salmycins it is also possible to replace the mono-saccharide 
residue, which is the bridge between the 
siderophore and the aminosugar unit, by another compound. 
The substances which are formed are accordingly composed 
of an iron chelate component, of a bridging compound 
(linker) and of the aminosugar unit. The invention consequently relates to a compound of the 
formula I
