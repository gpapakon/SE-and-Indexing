<ABSTRACT>
Metered dose dispensing valves providing good dosage 
reproducibility with formulations having a propensity to 

cream and with high potency low strength formulations. 
Valves having a tank retaining cup (24) have a small inlet 

aperture (34) of no more than 0.7mm and preferably the tank 
retaining cup (24) follows the configuration of the end of the 

valve stem. Valves having a bottle emptier attached to 
the valve stem have a filling channel in the valve stem 

which just protrudes from the metering chamber when the 
valve is in its inoperative position.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to metered-dose dispensing 
valves and in particular to valves for dispensing 
medicament from pressurised aerosol containers. Metering valves for use with pressurised metered 
dose inhalers (MDIs) need to meet certain performance 
criteria with regard to the sampling of the medicinal 
formulation, which is generally in the form of suspension 
of micronised drug particles in an aerosol propellant 
system. Specifically, the valve must sample the 
formulation homogenously in order that the correct dose 
of medicament is delivered to the patient on each 
actuation of the valve. Most commercially available 
valves fulfil this requirement when the formulation is 
well dispersed, however, it has been found that valve 
types vary considerably in their ability to dose high 
potency low concentration formulations. This problem is particularly significant when the 
formulations are not well dispersed as may occur in 
various conditions in the field, for instance when a 
formulation has been allowed to stand for a while such 
that creaming has taken place and the valve is actuated 
without shaking the product. In such circumstances, depending on the valve 
design, it may be possible to deliver either a dose 
within intended specification or a dose of up to about 
twenty times the target value. This problem is of 
extreme concern since it cannot be assumed that a patient 
will always shake an MDI product before use. In addition, a second effect has been identified 
where valve design may dramatically influence the 
consistency of drug delivery. This effect concerns a 
tendency for drug particles to migrate to the metering 
tank of the valve during storage or transit, with a 
consequent elevation in the amount of drug delivered in  
 
the first shot. It has been found that hugely elevated 
drug doses may be obtained due to this effect, 
particularly with high potency molecules for which there 
is a very small total quantity of active substance in the 
aerosol container. A third effect has been identified which may cause 
erratic dosing and this concerns the ability of drug to 
cream out of the metering tank of valves stored in the 
stem down position when the valve is of a type having an 
axial point of product entry. It is an object of the invention to provide metered-dose 
dispensing valves for aerosols in which these 
problems are reduced. According to one embodiment of the invention there 
is provided a metered dose valve for dispensing a 
medicinal aerosol formulation from a pressurised

<CLAIMS>
A metered dose valve for dispensing a medicinal 
aerosol formulation from a pressurised container, 

comprising: 
   a valve ferrule having an aperture therethrough; a 

metering tank having walls defining an exterior, an 
internal metering chamber, an inlet orifice, an inlet 

end, and an outlet end; an elongate valve stem having a 
filling channel, a filling end, a discharge end, and a 

discharge orifice; and a tank retaining cup having a 
proximal end and a distal end, 

   wherein the outlet end of the metering tank is in 
sealing engagement with the valve ferrule, the discharge 

end of the valve stem passes through the valve ferrule 
aperture and the outlet end of the metering tank and is 

in slidable sealing engagement with the valve ferrule 
aperture, 

   the filling end of the valve stem passes through and 
is in slidable engagement with the inlet orifice of the 

metering tank, 
   wherein the valve stem is movable between an 

extended closed position in which the filling channel of 
the valve stem allows open communication, via the inlet 

orifice, between the interior and the exterior of the 
metering chamber and the outlet end of the metering tank 

is closed, and a compressed open position in which the 
inlet orifice of the metering tank is in sealing 

engagement with the filling end of the valve stem and the 
discharge orifice of the valve stem allows open 

communication between the interior and exterior of the 
metering chamber, 

   and wherein the tank retaining cup has walls 
defining an aperture, is attached at its proximal end to 

the valve ferrule, and surrounds the metering tank 
 

forming a capillary pathway from the proximal end of the 
tank retaining cup to the inlet end of the metering tank, 

which pathway is defined by the tank retaining cup and 
the exterior of the metering tank, characterised in that 

the said aperture in the tank retaining cup has a 
diameter of no more than 0.70mm. 
A metered dose valve as claimed in Claim 1 in which 
the tank retaining cup is shaped to closely follow the 

configuration of the end of the valve stem within the 
tank retaining cup. 
A metered dose valve as claimed in Claims 1 or 2 in 
which the said aperture has a diameter of about 0.5mm. 
A metered dose valve for dispensing a medicinal 
aerosol formulation from a pressurised container, 

comprising: 
   a valve ferrule having an aperture therethrough; a 

metering tank having walls defining an exterior, an 
internal metering chamber, an inlet orifice, an inlet 

end, and an outlet end; an elongate valve stem having a

end and a distal end, 

   wherein the outlet end of the metering tank is in

end of the valve stem passes through the valve ferrule 
aperture and the outlet end of the metering tank and is

metering tank, 
   wherein the valve stem is movable between an 

extended closed position in which the filling channel of 
the valve stem allows open communication, via the inlet 

orifice, between the interior and the exterior of the 
 

metering chamber and the outlet end of the metering tank 
is closed, and a compressed open position in which the

which pathway is defined by the bottle emptier and the 

exterior of the metering tank, characterised in that the 
the filling channel of the valve stem is positioned such 

that only a small part of the filling channel protrudes 
from the metering chamber when the valve stem is in its

stem is moved towards its operative position. 
A metered dose valve as claimed in Claim 4 which

entire length of the metering chamber but has no flange

2. the bottle emptier extends no more than 90% of 
the length of the meter chamber, and 
3. the bottle emptier extends the entire length of 
the metering chamber to prevent free flow of contents 

from the dispensing container to the capillary pathway
