<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to absorbent articles such as 
diapers, sanitary napkins, adult incontinence devices, and the like 
which have fused layers. All manner and variety of absorbent articles configured for the 
absorption of body fluids such as menses, urine, and feces are, of 
course, well known. Absorbent articles are typically comprised of a 
number of layers of material. These generally include, from top to 
bottom, a liquid pervious layer, an absorbent layer, and a liquid 
impervious layer. Additional layers may also be interposed between 
any of these layers. Such additional layers may serve various 
different purposes. These layers are generally held together around their 
peripheries by some conventional means, such as adhesives, crimping,  
 
fusing, and other methods known in the art. The absorbent articles 
can have, and in many cases preferably will have, a liquid 
impermeable bond around their periphery. This will not interfere 
with the function of the absorbent article. However, it is 
frequently also desirable to bond the layers together at their 
faces. The attachment of the faces of these layers presents certain 
technical problems. This is particularly the case when it is 
desired to attach the upper liquid pervious layers and absorbent 
layers. The same means used for attaching the layers at their 
peripheries cannot be used because they will tend to block the flow 
of liquids to the absorbent layer. A number of attempts have been made to deal with this problem. 
These have included utilizing hot melt adhesives, and other 
non-water based adhesives. Such adhesives will be less likely to 
dissolve when contacted by body liquids. Other attempts have been 
directed at applying adhesives in very thin layers or in particular 
patterns to attempt to minimize the interference with the flow of 
liquids to the underlying layers. U.S. Patent 4,573,986 issued to 
Minetola, et al. on March 4, 1986 discloses one preferred way of 
applying adhesives. Although the application of adhesives in the 
manner described in the Minetola, et al. patent works quite well, 
the search for improved ways of securing the faces of the layers of 
absorbent products has continued. The main reason for searching for improved ways of securing the 
faces of such layers is that in many cases, adhesives which 
initially function adequately, may eventually fail and cause the 
liquid pervious layer to become unattached. This problem is 
particularly apparent during prolonged use of an absorbent article.
