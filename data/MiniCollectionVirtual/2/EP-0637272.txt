<ABSTRACT>
A method is disclosed for processing residue-containing packages so as to recover valuable materials, in particular pressure containers for dispensing polyurethane foams with propellant gases. For that purpose, extraction with a solvent is carried out essentially in atmosphere of propellant gas and/or solvent vapours.

A process for the recovery of the valuable 
materials from residue-containing packages, 

particularly pressure containers for dispensing 
polyurethane foam by means of propellent gases, by 

extraction with a solvent and comprising the following 
steps carried out in parallel and in an atmosphere 

substantially of propellent gas and/or solvent vapours:
 
insertion of the packages into a working container with 

simultaneous opening and extraction of the residues by 
means of a solvent,
 
transferring the residue-containing solution from the 

working container to a sump container,
 
concentrating the residue-containing solution in the 

sump container by evaporating the solvent,
 
condensing the evaporated solvent,
 
returning the solvent to the working ccontainer,
 
discharging the package residues from the working 

container and
 
after sufficient concentration, recovery of the 

residues in concentrated form from the sump container. 
A process according to claim 1, characterised in 
that the packages are opened by shredding.  

 
A process according to claim 2, characterised in 
that the packages are shredded by spraying with 

solvent. 
A process according to any of the preceding 
claims, characterised in that solid shredder residues 

are discharged by a conveyor, preferably a screw 
conveyor, from the working container. 
A process according to any of claims 2 to 4, 
characterised in that ferromagnetic shredder residues 

are discharged from the working container magnetically. 
A process according to any of claims 2 to 5, 
characterised in that the shredder residues are sprayed 

with solvent during discharge. 
A process according to any of the preceding 
claims, characterised in that the solvents used are 

esters, ketones or aliphatic and/or aromatic 
hydrocarbons having a boiling point up to about 200°C. 
A process according to claim 7, characterised in 
that the solvents used are acetone or toluene. 
A process according to any of the preceding 
claims, characterised in that the solvent from the sump 

container is distilled off at reduced pressure. 
A process according to any of the preceding 
claims, characterised in that gases, particularly 

propellants, and any solvents in the packages are 
separated and recovered.  

 
A process according to claim 10, characterised in 
that the gases are condensed. 
A process according to any of the preceding 
claims, characterised in that it is carried out in a 

protective gas of liberated propellent gas, preferably 
in propane, butane, dimethyl ether, fluorinated 

hydrocarbons and/or CO₂. 
A processing plant for working the process 
according to any of the preceding claims, comprising an 

input lock (11), and output lock (16), a device for 
opening packages (12) after their introduction, at 

least one feed line each for fresh solvent (22) and for 
protective gas (24), an outlet (17) for solvent 

containing soluble package residues, a conveyor (14) 
for solid package residues and at least one spray 

device (41, 42) for spraying solvents and directed 
towards the device for opening the packages (12), 

characterised by an extraction and collecting container 
(13) for the opened packages, an evaporating means (19) 

for distilling solvents, a condensation means (20) for 
distilled solvent, a return means (22) for condensed 

solvent and means for recovering dissolved package 
materials. 
A plant according to claim 13, characterised in 
that the device for opening the packages (12) is a 

shredder comprising two cutting drums rotating in 
opposite directions. 
A plant according to claim 13 or 14, characterised 
in that at least one spray nozzle (41a, 41b) is  

 
disposed above and directed towards the device for 

opening the packages (12). 
A plant according to any of claims 13 to 15, 
characterised in that at least one spray nozzle (42a, 

42b) is disposed below and directed towards the device 
for opening the packages (12). 
A plant according to any of claims 13 to 16, 
characterised by a conveyor screw (14) extending into 

the collecting container (13) so as to remove solid 
package residues. 
A plant according to any of claims 13 to 17, 
characterised in that no
zzles (43) for spraying solvent 
are disposed above and directed towards the device for 

conveying solid package residues. 
A plant according to any of claims 13 to 18, 
characterised by a drying section (15) following the 

conveyor (14). 
A plant according to any of claims 13 to 19, 
characterised by separate protective gas supply lines 

(23, 23a) in the neighbourhood of the lock means (11, 
16).
