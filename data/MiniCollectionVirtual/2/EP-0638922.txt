<ABSTRACT>
Reflective notching of a photoresist pattern (22), generated 
over reflective materials on a semiconductor substrate (12), is 

minimized by using an anti-reflective layer (20) of silicon-rich 
silicon nitride. The layer of silicon-rich silicon nitride is formed 

over the reflective materials and a layer of photoresist is then 
formed over the silicon-rich silicon nitride. The photoresist layer 

is then photolithographically patterned to form an integrated 

circuit pattern (22). The silicon-rich silicon nitride layer has an 
absorptive index of greater than 0.25, which allows it to be used 

as an anti-reflective layer with photolithographic patterning 
systems having ultraviolet and deep ultraviolet exposure 

wavelengths.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates generally to semiconductor devices, 
and more generally to a process for forming an integrated circuit 
pattern on a semiconductor substrate. The semiconductor industry's continuing drive toward 
integrated circuits with ever decreasing geometries, coupled 
with its pervasive use of highly reflective materials, such as 
polysilicon, aluminum, and metal silicides, has led to increased 
photolithographic patterning problems. Unwanted reflections 
from these underlying materials, during the photoresist 
patterning process, cause the resulting photoresist patterns to be 
distorted. This problem is further compounded when 
photolithographic imaging tools having ultraviolet (UV) and deep 
ultraviolet (DUV) exposure wavelengths are used to generate the 
photoresist patterns. Although shorter imaging wavelengths 
bring improved resolution by minimizing diffraction limitations, 
the resulting patterns generated in the photoresist are easily 
compromised by the effects of uncontrolled reflections from 
underlying materials due to the increased optical metallic nature 
of underlying reflective materials at these wavelengths. 
Moreover, photoresist patterns are particularly degraded in areas 
where the topology of the underlying reflective material changes. 
In these stepped areas the reflection intensity from underlying 
materials is often enhanced and results in "reflective notching" 
or a locally distorted photoresist pattern near the stepped areas. 
Therefore, the formation of submicron photoresist patterns over 
semiconductor substrates is difficult to achieve, and as a result, 
fabrication of advanced integrated circuits with submicron 
geometries is limited.  Accordingly, a need exists for a method that forms 
submicron integrated circuit patterns in a photoresist layer 
which overlies the varying topography and highly reflective 
materials found on semiconductor substrates. The previously mentioned problems with existing methods 
for forming an integrated circuit pattern on a semiconductor 
substrate are overcome by the present invention. In one 
embodiment of the invention, a semiconductor substrate is 
provided. A device layer is then formed overlying the major 
surface of the semiconductor substrate. An anti-reflective layer 
having an absorptive index is then formed overlying the device 
layer. The anti-reflective layer is an inorganic dielectric 
material containing silicon and nitrogen. A photoresist layer is 
then formed overlying the anti-reflective layer. The photoresist
