A self-boring fastener (1), comprising a fastener 
body (2) with an axially parallel slot (4) formed at its 

free end, and a lamellar drill bit (3) inserted at one end 
into the slot (4) in the fastener body (2), wherein the 

drill bit (3) is connected in a form-locking and force-locking 
manner by deformation of the jaws (5, 6) defining 

the slot (4) in the fastener body (2), characterised in 
that in its end region engaging in the slot (4) in the 

fastener body (2) the drill bit (3) has on one or both 
lateral boundary surfaces (7) one or more notches, 

indentations, grooves or recesses (8) extending across the 
thickness (D) of the drill bit (3) and into which 

respectively is/are pressed under plastic deformation a 
peripheral zone of one jaw (5, 6) or the peripheral zones 

of both jaws (5, 6) of the fastener body (2). 
A self-boring fastener according to Claim 1, 
characterised in that the notches, indentations, grooves 

or recesses (8) are arranged mirror-inverted with respect 
to one another on both lateral boundary surfaces (7) of 

the drill bit (3). 
A self-boring fastener according to Claim 1, 
characterised in that the notches, indentations, grooves 

or recesses (8) are arranged offset with respect to one 
another on both lateral boundary surfaces (7) of the drill 

bit (3). 
A self-boring fastener according to any one of 
Claims 1 to 3, characterised in that the notches, 

indentations, grooves or recesses (8) are bounded in a 
circular arc in cross-section.  

 
A self-boring fastener according to Claim 1 and any 
one of Claims 2 to 4, characterised in that channels (13, 

14) are formed on both lateral boundaries of the drill bit 
(3) on opposing surfaces (11, 12), wherein the notches, 

indentations, grooves or recesses (8) extending across the 
thickness (D) of the drill bit are provided in the 

vicinity of these channels (13, 14). 
A self-boring fastener according to Claim 5, 
characterised in that the channels (13, 14) start at a 

small distance (A) from the end (15) of the drill bit (3) 
and extend over a majority of the length of the portion of 

the drill bit (3) inserted into the slot (4). 
A self-boring fastener according to Claim 1 and any 
one of Claims 2 to 6, characterised in that at one end 

(15) the drill bit (3) has an extension of narrower width, 
which engages so as to be centred in a coaxial opening 

adjoining the slot (4) in the fastener body (2).
