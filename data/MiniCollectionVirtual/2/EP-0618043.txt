<ABSTRACT>
Disclosed is a technique that comprises selective removal of material 
from a surface of a polycrystalline diamond (polyD) film (e.g., 11) such that a non-planar 

surface results. Exemplarily the technique is used to form polyD optical 
elements, e.g., convex or concave lenses, or Fresnel lenses, including arrays of such 

lenses. The technique comprises maintaining on appropriately shaped hot template 
body in intimate contact with a polyD surface for a time (e.g., in the range 1 - 1000 

hours) sufficient to result in formation of the desired feature in the polyD surface. 
The template bod
y comprises a rare earth metal (La and Ce are preferred), Mn and/or 
Fe, and the temperature is below the melting temperature of the template body. 

Removal of "spent" template material by, e.g., chemical etching and finishing of the 
polyD feature, e.g., by laser ablation and/or polishing, are contemplated.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention pertains to polycrystalline diamond (herein polyD) film, 
and to methods of shaping the film. PolyD films, typically prepared by chemical vapor deposition (CVD), 
have received considerable attention in recent years, because of their remarkable 
properties. These include high thermal conductivity, optical transparency, high 
refractive index, mechanical hardness and chemical inertness. It is known that the hardness of diamond is strongly dependent on 
crystal orientation, so that a soft diamond crystal plane can be abraded by a hard 
crystal plane. This fact is used in conventional diamond polishing, which involves 
removal of material from soft crystal planes by means of (randomly oriented) 
diamond powder. PolyD film comprises many crystallites, and there will always be present 
crystallites that have one of their hard directions approximately oriented in the 
removal direction, and thus cannot be removed easily by conventional means. It is 
principally for this reason that removal of material from polyD films has been 
problematical. U.S. Patent application Serial No. 07/822,470, filed January 17, 1992 for 
J. E. Graebner et al., discloses a method of removing material from a polyD film that 
comprises maintaining the film in intimate contact with Fe, Ni, Mn or Ti at 
600-1100°C. See also S. Jin et al., AppliedPhysicsLetters, Vol. 60, p. 1948 (1992), 
and S. Jin et al., DiamondFilmsandRelatedMaterials, Vol. 1, p. 949 (1992). The 
required intimate contact typically is attained through application of pressure during 
the high temperature treatment. U.S. Patent application Serial No. 07/908,130, filed 
July 2, 1992 for W. C. Dautremont-Smith et al., discloses thinning of polyD film by 
contacting the film with molten or partially molten metal that dissolves carbon, 
exemplarily a rare earth (e.g., La or Ce) or mixture of rare earths. It also discloses 
that portions of a surface of the polyD film can be protected by masks against the 
liquid metal. See also U.S. Patent application Serial No. 07/955,634, filed 
October 2, 1992 for J. E. Graebner et al., which discloses use of a molten or partially 
molten alloy of a rare earth metal (e.g., Ce) and a melting point-lowering metal, e.g., 
Ni, permitting a drastic reduction in thinning temperature, as compared to the 
method of the '130 application.  U.K. Patent application GB 2,061,904A discloses shaping a diamond 
body (not polyD) by contacting the body with an appropriately shaped metal 
(preferably Fe, Ni, Pt or alloys thereof) "template"
