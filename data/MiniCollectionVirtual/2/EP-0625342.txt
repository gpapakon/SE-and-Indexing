<ABSTRACT>
A material (11), in particular for orthopaedic appliances, made from an amorphous thermoplastic forming a matrix layer (26), for example room-temperature-polymerising PMMA, and reinforcing fibres (28) lying therein. A plurality of matrix layers (26) bonded in the manner of a laminate and each containing fibres (28), may be provided. The material (11) can be shaped in the production of the orthopaedic appliances and re-shaped during use of the appliance, in each case by warming to less than 200@C. In order to prepare the material (11), a mixture (10) of the reaction constituents of the plastic is introduced into a mould (24), the fibres (28) are laid thereon, and the polymerising plastic is compressed. Further mixture (10) and further fibres (28) can be processed in the same way during the polymerisation of the first matrix layer (26) to give further layers of the laminate-like material (11). The material is used for self-supporting shell-like appliances, in particular in orthopaedic technology.
