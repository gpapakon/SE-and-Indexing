<ABSTRACT>
An electro-hydraulic control device (S) for a clamping device of an automatic lathe, with a pressure reducing valve (V) connected to a pressure source (1), the output of which can be connected via a directional control valve (W) to two user lines (11, 12) operable alternately, with a pressure switching device (D) fitted in the pressure reducing valve (V) and with a regulating input (20) to which control pressure can be applied, whereby in the directional control valve (W) there is a user pressure tapping (Z) at which the control pressure exists only in the control position (a and/or b) of the multi-way valve where the output (6) of the pressure reducing valve (V) is properly connected to a user line (11, 12), and in which the pressure tapping (Z) is connected to the control input (20). In the pressure reducing valve (V), between the control piston (14) and the pressure switching device (D) there is a mechanical, motion-transmitting link with which the pressure switching device (D) is actuatable directly by the control piston (14) once the monitoring pressure set via the force of the spring (22) has been reached.
