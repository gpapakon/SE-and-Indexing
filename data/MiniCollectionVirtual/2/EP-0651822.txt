<ABSTRACT>
There is marked over-expression of multiple spliced variants of the CD44 gene in tumour compared to counterpart normal tissue. This observation forms the basis of a method of diagnosing neoplasia by analysis of a sample of body tissue or body fluid or waste product. A new exon 6 of 129 bp has been located and sequenced, and is claimed as such and for use in the diagnostic method.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention is concerned with using 
expression of the CD44 gene or part of the CD44 gene to 
investigate neoplasia. Such investigation includes 
taking a tissue, body fluid or other sample from a 
patient to perform diagnosis, to give a prognosis or 
to evaluate therapy that is already being carried out. 
In particular, the invention provides a simple method 
for carrying out routine screening for neoplasia using 
body fluid samples or other samples which can be 
obtained non-invasively. The usual way to diagnose a tumour at present 
is by looking at cells or thin slices of tissue down a 
microscope, a method which is often very effective but 
has some important limitations. With a small sample, 
diagnosis can be very difficult and often a large 
number of cells will not be available, or it is not 
desirable or possible to obtain a large sample from 
the patient. In as many as 50% of cases a reliable 
diagnosis cannot be given; it may be that there is no 
positive evidence of carcinoma but also no certainty 
that the patient is actually free from carcinoma. 
More invasive investigation is then required to 
establish a diagnosis. Judgment of prognosis also relies on the 
appearance of cells when viewed under a microscope. 
Generally, the more bizarre-looking the cells in a 
primary tumour, the more likely they are to 
metastasise later on but the correlation is by no 
means absolute. It would clearly be an advantage to 
be able to predict more accurately whether or not  
 
metastasis is likely to occur in order to judge what 
will be the most effective treatment. The human CD44 gene codes for a family of 
variably glycosylated cell surface proteins of 
different sizes, the numerous functions of which are 
not yet fully established, but which share epitopes 
recognised by the CD44 monoclonal antibody (mAb). It 
is known to consist of a standard portion which is 
expressed in haemopoietic cells and many other cell 
types and into which the products of additional exons 
may be spliced in various combinations to produce 
different proteins. This is a well recognised 
mechanism in eukaryotes for producing several often 
functionally unrelated proteins from the same gene, and 
is known as alternative splicing. Two common CD44 isoforms have so far been 
purified and characterised (Stamenkovic et al. 1989), 
namely i) a 90kD form consisting of a central 37kD 
core which is heavily glycosylated and ii) a 180kD 
form which has 135 extra amino acids inserted into the 
proximal extra-membrane domain and
