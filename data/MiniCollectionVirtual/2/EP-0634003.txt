<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a load cell for the measurement of force. More 
specifically, the invention relates to a load cell for the measurement of force resulting in 
strain or stress created by means such as, for example, force, acceleration, or pressure and 
converting the force into an electronic signal transmitted to a point of computation or 
evaluation. The device resists environmental interferences such as those created by 
variations in age, temperature and humidity, which may ultimately affect modulus, 
hysteresis, or anelastic material properties. Load measuring devices and cells are known in the art. A meter for measuring 
mass or force wherein the sensed displacement acts indirectly on the tension of the two 
transversely vibrating electrically excited strings is known. Overload protection for a load 
cell is also known. A mounting structure for double bar resonators to ensure symmetrical 
loading of the resonator responsive to external forces is also known. Further, various types of sensors are used in load cells, such as vibrating 
members, a pretension string, two flat springs and piezoelectric oscillators. In addition, 
bridge circuits, electric feedback and frequency responsive circuits are used in load cells. Recently, quartz double-ended tuning forks have been used as force sensors in 
environments where the tension resisted the movement of the loaded structure, or the 
tension was produced by strain within the loaded structure . Levered systems and parallel 
guiding structures have been used where the force applied to the force sensing crystal was 
a fraction of applied load. The force sensing crystal was generally small since the force 
required to cause adeuate frequency change in the resonant double-ended quartz tuning fork 
did not need to be great. However, the loaded structure had to be massive to resist effects of undesirable 
lateral deflection. The flexing portions of these structures which acted as parallel bending 
beams or bending fulcrums carried some load since the force sensing crystal and its bonded 
joints deflected when tension was applied to the crystal.  
 The prior art load cells were dependent on the stability of the loaded structure 
and the bonding joints, over temperature and time, for output stability. For example, a load 
cell, intended to provide a linear relationship between the signal generated and the force 
sensed, uses a specific crystal design attached by screws to the frame of the load cell which 
creates a frictional joint resulting in inadequate
