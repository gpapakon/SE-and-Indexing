<ABSTRACT>
In accordance with the present invention, a circuit 
assembly is manufactured in an additive process using at 

least one layer of a fluoropolymer composite material and a 
conductive material. The conductive layers are plated, and 

the fluoropolymer composite layers are laminated. The use 
of the filled fluoropolymeric composite eliminates the need 

for a barrier metal layer between the insulation and the 
conductors. A plurality of these circuit assemblies are 

stacked, one on top of the other. At least, selected 
exposed locations of the conductive material comprise a 

diffusible conductive material (e.g., gold). Once stacked 
the circuit assemblies are subjected to lamination under 

heat and pressure to simultaneously fuse adjacent 
fluoropolymer composite material and diffuse adjacent 

diffusible conductive material together to form an integral 
multilayer circuit having solid conductive interconnects.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates generally to methods of 
manufacturing multilayer circuit boards and multichip 
modules, referred to collectively herein as circuits. More 
particularly, this invention relates to new and improved 
methods of manufacturing multilayer circuits wherein 
interconnections between multichip module assemblies 
(circuit assemblies) is accomplished in a single lamination 
step utilizing a fluoropolymer composite material and 
diffusible conductive material (e.g. a noble metal). The need for and desirability of substrates for MCM's 
is well known in the electronic industry. The need for 
increased density in I/C packaging, increased 
interconnection capacity, and improved interconnection 
performance is well known among those involved in VLSI 
packaging and elsewhere in the electronics industry. A multichip module can be viewed as a packaging 
technique in which several I/C chips, which may include 
complex microprocessor chips, memory chips, etc., are 
interconnected by a high density substrate. Although 
substrates for MCMs have been known in general for several 
years, these known prior art substrates for MCMs typically 
use thin film polyimide based material systems, and those 
systems have known deficiencies. Polyimide dielectric 
materials suffer from poor thermo-mechanical reliability  
 
and stability and electrical performance limitations. The 
polyimide materials usually are thermosetting, and have 
high elastic modulus, and there is a significant mismatch, 
i.e., difference, between the coefficient of thermal 
expansion (CTE) of the polyimide and the copper-conductors 
and/or other elements of the circuit structures. That all 
results in high stresses in the polyimide material and in 
surrounding materials and interfaces during thermal 
excursions in either or both the manufacturing process for 
or during use of the MCM substrate. Those stresses can lead 
to dimensional instabilities, cracking, delamination and 
other thermo-mechanically related problems. Also, the 
chemical bond between the polyimide and the copper 
conductors may be weak and is usually sensitive to the 
presence of water, thus leading to poor reliability of the 
copper-polyimide interface. In some manufacturing processes for polyimide-based 
substrates for MCMs, a liquid form polyimide precursor is 
applied and then cured; in other processes, a sheet form 
polyimide prepreg is used. In either case, it is difficult 
to keep water out of the MCM substrate structure made with 
polyimides. Water is often generated
