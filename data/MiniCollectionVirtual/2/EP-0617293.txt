<ABSTRACT>
This invention is embodied in an apparatus for assessing the effects of 
controlled amounts of well-characterized ionic or other particles on the reliability of 

electronic components. The chamber includes a high efficiency filter that purifies the 
input air and a recirculating system which ensures substantially laminar, constant 

velocity air flow, controllable humidity, and steady state conditions throughout at 
least a portion of the chamber. Particles are introduced i
nto the chamber from a 
particle generator through a series of output ports that ensure a uniform 

concentration of particles throughout at least a portion of the chamber. Substantially 
constant conditions are achieved by constantly introducing new particles into the 

chamber, withdrawing a continuous flow of particle-laden air from the chamber, 
removing essentially all the particles from the particle-laden air withdrawn from the 

chamber and introducing a continuous flow of filtered air into the chamber. 
Additionally provisions for monitoring particle concentrations and size distribution, 

for controlling the relative humidity in the chamber, and for carrying out electrical 
aging and testing can be incorporated.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to particle exposure chambers, specifically 
chambers for testing specimens to various atmospheric conditions. The reliability of integrated circuits, discrete devices, connectors, 
printed wiring boards, backplane wiring systems, etc. is strongly influenced by their 
environment. The harmful effects of moisture and contamination on electronic 
devices and assemblies are well documented. See R. B. Comizzoli, et al., "Corrosion 
of Electronic Materials and Devices" Science, Vol. 234, pg. 340-345 (1986). 
Contamination may be introduced during manufacturing, or it may be deposited 
from the ambient environment during use. Of concern is a 10-100 fold increase in 
the deposition rate of fine particles on critical component surfaces due to forced-air 
cooling, necessitated by the greater power densities found in many present-day 
devices and assemblies. Atmospheric particles of concern typically exhibit a bimodal mass 
distribution over the size range of approximately 0.01 - 15µm in diameter. Particles 
larger than 15µm are usually removed by filtration systems. Coarse particles (about 
1 -15µm), which are likely to be rich in calcium and are derived principally from 
mechanical processes, are typically removed with approximately 95% efficiency by 
standard air filtration systems. However, fine particles (about 0.05 - 1µm), which 
are likely to be rich in ammonium sulfate and other corrosive substances derived 
from fossil fuel combustion and natural processes, are difficult to remove by 
filtration and constitute the bulk of particles transferred indoors from the outdoor 
environment. Fine particles are a significant corrosion hazard to most electronic 
devices because of their great ionic content. These particles tend to adsorb moisture 
from the environment, thereby forming an electrolyte. In the presence of an applied 
potential, leakage currents are set up and fault-producing electrolytic corrosion takes 
place. Ionic contamination of electronic devices, subassemblies and assemblies 
(collectively "components") from fine particles is an increasing cause of equipment 
failures. While numerous chambers exist for life testing of electronic components 
and devices in the presence of gaseous contaminants, only a few have been described 
for testing with dust particles. See, EIA Standard RS-364-50, "Test Procedure #50  
 
Sand Dust Test Procedure for Electrical Connectors," Electrical Industries 
Association, Washington, D.C., 1983. The few existing dust exposure chambers are 
designed
