<ABSTRACT>
In the new bridge, a support for the upper pivotable roadway section (7) is articulated on the base body (1) in its bottom-boom region (2), the support (18) being constructed in the form of a ramp wedge. The ramp wedge is provided with a guiding profile (20) on which the free end of the roadway section (7) is supported. On pivoting up the ramp wedge (18), the roadway section (7) is raised as well. In the normal or run-on position, the ramp wedge (18) is directed outwards from the bridge centre. It is sufficient to pivot it up by only a certain angle. For further pivoting-up of the support (18) and raising of the roadway section (7) up to the upper coupling position, all that is required is to push the bridge sections together.

Portable bridge comprising at least one bridge section
(A; A1, A2), which has the following parts:


a base unit (1) which decreases in height at least
towards one end,
at least one road surface section (7, 7'), which
may be swivelled around a horizontal transverse shaft

member (6, 6') arranged remote from the end of the base
unit (1), i.e. between the run-up position resting on

the corresponding end of the base unit (1) and a
coupling position raised by it,
and a support (18; 18a, 18b) articulated to the
base unit (1) around a further transverse shaft member

(17),

characterised in that

when the respective end of the bridge section is in the
run-up position,


the support (18; 18a, 18b) is arranged to lie flat
and point outwards, i.e. away from the centre of the

bridge section,
the swivelling road surface section (7, 7') is
arranged so that it is supported at its free end on the

support (18; 18a, 18b),
and the support (18; 18a, 18b) is arranged so
that its free end - as viewed from the centre of the

bridge section - protrudes beyond the free end of the
road surface section (7, 7').
Bridge according to Claim 1, characterised in that the
transverse shaft member (17) of the support (18; 18a,

18b) is arranged behind the free end of the road surface
section (7, 7'), i.e. displaced from the free end

towards the centre of the bridge section.
Bridge according to Claim 1 or 2, characterised in that
the support (18; 18a, 18b) has a guide profile (20) on 

its upper side facing the road surface section (7, 7').
Bridge according to Claim 3, characterised in that the
road surface section (7, 7') is supported on the guide

profile (20) via a guide element (22).
Bridge according to Claim 3 or 4, characterised in that
the guide profile (20) has an end stop (21.11) on the

free end of the support (18; 18a, 18b).
Bridge according to one of Claims 3 to 5, characterised
in that the guide profile (20) is constructed as a guide

groove (21).
Bridge according to Claim 4 and Claim 6, characterised
in that the guide element (22) is constructed as a bolt

engaging into the guide groove (21).
Bridge according to Claim 4, characterised in that the
guide element (22) is constructed as a guide roller.
Bridge according to one of the preceding claims,
characterised in that the support is constructed as a

ramp wedge (18).
Bridge according to Claim 3 and Claim 9, characterised
in that guide profile (20; 21) is arranged above the

road surface of the ramp wedge (18).
Bridge according to Claim 3 and one of the preceding
claims, characterised in that the guide profile (20; 21)

has an on average ascending course - when the support
(18) is in flat state and when viewed from its free end

towards the transverse shaft member (17) of the support. 
Bridge according to Claim 11, characterised in that the
guide profile (20; 21) initially has a short, steep

course (21.1) and subsequently has a course (21.1) with
a lower gradient.
Bridge according to Claim 11 or 12, characterised in
that the guide profile (20; 21) has a part-section

(21.3) with a flat course at its end facing the
transverse shaft member (17) of the support.
Bridge according to one of the preceding claims,
characterised in that the base unit (1) has a lower

chord region (2) and for this is equipped with a locking
arrangement (16), which may be operated by means of a

coupling mechanism (33 to 39).
Bridge according to Claim 14, characterised in that the
locking arrangement is constructed as a bolt coupling

(16).
Bridge according to Claim 14, characterised in that the
coupling mechanism (33 to 39) may be operated from the

outside via an operating member (39').
Bridge according to Claim 14 and one of the preceding
claims, characterised in that the support (18) is

connected via a mechanical connection (39, 41 to 43) to
