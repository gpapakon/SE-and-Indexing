<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a tub, especially a sanitary tub, with a supply device forming an air outlet nozzle (21) and a water outlet nozzle (22) for generating an air jet and/or a water jet in the tub water, and with a nozzle housing (23) which has channels (24, 25) for the supply of water or air. The air supply channel (24) and the water supply channel (25) open in two separate outlet openings (15, 16) in the tub interior (26) and can each be closed and opened separately.

the direction of flow of the compressed air (26).
Tub according to claim 5, 
characterised In that
 the first actuator device (29)
has a first pressure impact surface (30) which is several times larger than the

first back surface (31) of the air valve body (14) which directly receives the 
impact of the compressed air in the closing direction of the air valve body (15).
Tub according to claim 5 or 6, 
characterised in that
 the first actuator device
(29) has a bellows, membrane or piston-like first force transfer element (11)

which yields under the force of the compressed air, with which the air valve
body (14) is firmly connected via for example a rod-shaped first connecting

element (13).
Tub according to claim 7, 
characterised in that
 the first force transfer element
(11) exerts a return force on the air valve body (14) in the closing direction.
Tub according to any of claims 4 to 8, 
characterised in that
 the end face of the
air valve body (14) facing the tub interior (26) in its closing position is flush

with or projects slightly beyond the adjacent end face of the end wall (27) or
the end inspection cap (1) of the nozzle housing (23).
Tub according to any of claims 1 to 9, 
characterised in that
 the water outlet
nozzle (22) has a tightly closing water valve which can be opened under the

pressure of the water supply to the tub Interior (26) against the action of a
return force.
Tub according to claim 10, 
characterised in that
 the water valve has a water
valve body (2) which lifts from the water valve seat (32) to open against the

direction of flow of the pressurised water in the tub interior (26).
Tub according to claim 10 or 11, 
characterised in that
 the pressurised water
acts via a second actuator device (33) on the water valve body (2) in a

direction opposed to the direction of flow of the pressurized water in the tub
interior (26).
Tub according to claim 12, 
characterised in that
 the second actuator device
(33) has a second pressure impact surface (34) which Is essentially, that is 

several times, larger than the second back surface (35) of the water valve
body (2) which directly receives the Impact of the pressurized water in the

closing direction of the water valve body (2),
Tub according to claim 12 or 13, 
characterised in that
 the second actuator
device (33) has a bellows, membrane or piston-like second force element (8)

which yields under the force of the pressurized water, with which the water
valve body (2) is firmly connected via for example a rod-shaped second

connecting element (3).
Tub according to claim 14, 
characterised in that
