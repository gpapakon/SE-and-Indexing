their mixtures, the compounds of formula (I):



in which R represents a radical chosen from the group
constituted by the radicals:


The compounds of formula (I) as defined in claim 1 in
which the cyclopropane copula is of 1Rcis structure.
The compounds of formula (I) as defined in claim 1 or 2
in which the geometry of the double bond is E.
The compounds of formula (I) as defined in any one of
claims 1 to 3 in which R represents the [(4-methyl 2,3,5,6-tetrafluoro)

phenyl] methyl radical. 
The compounds of formula (I) as defined in any one of
claims 1 to 3 in which R represents a 4-(2-propyn-1-yl)

2,3,5,6-tetrafluoro) phenyl] methyl radical.

claims 1 to 5 in which R represents a cyano(3-phenoxy 4-fluorophenyl)

methyl radical.
Preparation process for the compounds of formula (I) as
defined in any one of claims 1 to 7 characterized in that an

acid of formula (II):


or a functional derivative of this acid, is subjected to the
action of an alcohol of formula (III):


ROH

in which R retains its previous meaning, or a functional
derivative of this alcohol, in order to obtain the

corresponding compound of formula (I).
The compositions intended for combating parasites of
vegetation, parasites of premises and parasites of warm-blooded

animals, characterized in that they contain as active
ingredient at least one compound defined in any one of claims

1 to 7.
The insecticide compositions, characterized in that

they contain as active ingredient at least one compound
defined in any one of claims 1 to 7. 
The insecticide compositions defined in claim 10,
characterized in that they are intended for combating

DIABROTICA and other parasites of the soil.
The acaricide and nematicide compositions,
characterized in that they contain as active ingredient at

least one compound defined in any one of claims 1 to 7.
Combinations endowed with insecticide, acaricide or
nematicide activity, characterized in that they contain as

active ingredient, on the one hand at least one of the
compounds of general formula (I) and on the other hand, at

least one of the pyrethrinoid esters chosen from the group
constituted by the group constituted by the esters of

allethrolone, of 3,4,5,6-tetrahydrophthalimidomethyl alcohol,
of 5-benzyl-3-furyl methyl alcohol, of 3-phenoxybenzyl

alcohol and of alpha-cyano-3-phenoxybenzyl alcohol with
chrysanthemic acids, by the esters of 5-benzyl-3-furyl methyl

alcohol with 2,2-dimethyl-3-(2-oxo-3-tetrahydrothiophenylidenemethyl)-cyclopropanecarboxylic
acids, by the esters of

3-phenoxybenzyl alcohol and of alpha-cyano-3-phenoxybenzyl
alcohol with 2,2-dimethyl-3-(2,2-dichlorovinyl)cyclopropanecarboxylic

acids, by the esters of alpha-cyano-3-phenoxy-benzyl
alcohol with 2,2-dimethyl-3-(2,2-dibromovinyl)-cyclopropanecarboxylic

acids, by the esters of
3-phenoxybenzyl alcohol with 2-parachlorophenyl-2-isopropyl

acetic acids, by the esters of allethrolone, of 3,4,5,6-tetrahydrophthalimidomethyl
alcohol, of 5-benzyl-3-furyl

methyl alcohol, of 3-phenoxybenzyl alcohol, and of alphacyano-3-phenoxybenzyl
alcohol with 2,2-dimethyl-3-(1,2,2,2-tetrahaloethyl)-cyclopropanecarboxylic

acids, in which "halo"
represents a fluorine, chlorine or bromine atom, it being

understood that the compounds (I) can exist in all their
possible stereoisomeric forms, as well as the acid and

alcohol copulas of the above pyrethrinoid esters.
