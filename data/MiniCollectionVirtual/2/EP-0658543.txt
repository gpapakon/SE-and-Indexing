<ABSTRACT>
A process for producing an α-alkoxyiminophenylacetonitrile represented by general formula [III], 

(wherein R¹, R², R³ and Y are each as defined in the specification) by reacting an alkali metal salt of an 
α-hydroxyiminophenylacetonitrile, represented by general formula [I]
, (wherein R¹, R², Y and A are each as defined 
in the specification) with a dialkyl sulfate represented by the general formula [II]
: (R³)₂SO₄, (wherein R³ is as defined 
in the specification) in the presence of a phase transfer catalyst in a solvent mixture composed of a hydrocarbon 

solvent and water. It is possible by using the above catalyst and solvent mixture to inhibit the formation of a nitrone 
derivative as a by-product to thereby produce a highly pure alkoxyimino compound in a high yield.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a process for producing α-alkoxyiminophenylacetonitrile
derivatives of the general formula [III]:

wherein R1 and R2 are the same or different and are independently C1-C5 alkyl, C1-C5
alkoxy, C2-C4 alkenyl, hydrogen, halogen or trifluoromethyl, R3 is C1-C5
alkyl, and Y is
-O-, -S-, -NCH3-, -CH2O-, -OCH2-, -CH2S- or -SCH2-.The alkoxyimino-containing compounds [III] are known as intermediates of
medicaments or agricultural chemicals. As the process of their production, it is that
hydroxyimino-containing compounds are reacted with an alkylating agent such as sulfuric
ester, e.g., dimethyl sulfate in the presence of a base in an organic solvent. There is,
however, a disadvantage that the reaction of an alkylating agent such as dimethyl sulfate
in an organic solvent give rise to the formation of nitrone derivatives, as by-products,
of
the general formula [XII]:

wherein R1, R2, R3 and Y are each as defined above, which causes a decrease in the yield
and purity of the desired products. The present inventors have extensively studied to develop a more favorable
process for producing α-alkoxyiminophenylacetonitrile derivatives. As a result, they
have found that the formation of nitrone derivatives as by-products can be reduced by
effecting the reaction in a mixed solvent consisting of a hydrocarbon solvent and water in
the presence of a phase transfer catalyst and the alkoxyimino-containing
compounds [III]
can therefore be produced in high yield, thereby completing the present invention.Thus, the present invention provides a process for producing an α-alkoxyiminophenylacetonitrile
derivative of the general formula [III]:

wherein R1, R2, R3 and Y are each as defined above, characterized in that an α-hydroxyiminophenylacetonitrile
derivative of the general formula [ I ]:

wherein R1, R2 and Y are each as defined above and A is hydrogen, an alkali metal or an
alkaline earth metal, is reacted with a dialkyl sulfate of the general formula [II]:
(R3)2SO4
wherein R3 is as defined above in a mixed solvent consisting of a hydrocarbon solvent
and water in the presence of a phase transfer catalyst.The present invention will hereinafter be explained in detail. As the R1 and R2 in the formula of α-hydroxyiminophenylacetonitrile
derivative of the general formula [ I ], there can be mentioned, for example, C1-C5
alkyl
such as methyl, ethyl, propyl, isopropyl, butyl, sec-butyl, tert-butyl, amyl and tert-amyl;
and C1-C5 alkoxy such as methoxy, ethoxy, propoxy and butoxy; C2-C4 alkenyl such as
eth
