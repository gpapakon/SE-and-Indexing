Method of cleaning vessel treatment machines 
having treatment stations, such as filling and closing 

elements, which rotate in a turning circle (5), wherein 
rinsing vessels, which are appropriately configured for 

the cleaning process, are individually mounted on said 
stations, are rotated with the vessel treatment machine 

and are removed again once the treatment stations have 
been cleaned, characterised in that a supply means (9), 

which can be supplied from outside to the turning circle 
(5) of the vessel treatment machine, is brought into a 

feed position with the turning circle, and the 
individual rinsing vessels are supplied successively to 

the supply means, brought into a locking position by 
said means, connected to the treatment stations and 

rotated and, once the rinsing process has ended, the 
rinsing vessels are separated from the treatment 

stations by the supply means and guided from the turning 
circle externally of the region of the vessel treatment 

machine. 
Method according to claim 1, characterised in 
that the rinsing vessels are supplied from a storage 

position to a revolving star (11) of the supply means 
(9) and forcibly guided by said means to a control 

finger (16), which grips the rinsing vessels, and the 
rinsing vessels are brought into the transfer position 

through the treatment station in opposition to a spring 
(3), whereupon said station is lowered, and the rinsing 

vessel is connectable to the treatment station by 
relieving the load on the external casing (2).  

 
Method according to one of claims 1 or 2, using 
a two-part rinsing vessel, the external casing of which 

abuts against the internal rinsing housing by means of 
spring tension and is provided with a locking 

connection, characterised in that the external casing 
(2) is brought into a lower locking position by a 

control finger (16) of the revolving star (11) and is 
lockable with said treatment station after the latter 

has been lowered by relieving the load on the external 
casing (2). 
Method according to claim 2, characterised in 
that the supply of the rinsing vessels into the region 

of the turning circle (5) occurs when the otherwise 
usual lowering movement of the filler valve centring 

body is effected for sealing the vessel. 
Apparatus for accomplishing the method according 
to one of claims 1 to 3, having a supply means for the 

individual rinsing vessels, wherein the supply means (9) 
is formed from a conveyor (7), a revolving star (11) and 

a guide path (12), which is insertable beneath the plane 
of movement of the rotating treatment stations, and each 

receiving cavity (14) of the revolving star (11) has a 
cam-guided control finger (16) for the locking and 

lifting movement of the rinsing vessel. 
Apparatus according to claim 5, characterised in 
that the supply means (9) in the operative position is 

directly drivable by the turning circle (5) of the 
vessel treatment machine. 
Apparatus according to claim 6, characterised in 
that the drive means are disposed on the external casing  

 
of the turning circle (5) of the vessel treatment 

machine and engage in the drive means (19) thereof by 
displacing the supply means (9) into the operative 

position.
