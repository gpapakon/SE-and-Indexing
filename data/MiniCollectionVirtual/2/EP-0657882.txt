<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention generally relates to a disc 
cartridge apparatus and more particularly, to a disc 
cartridge apparatus which rotatably accommodates a circular 
disc such as an optical recording disc, a magneto-optic 
recording disc and a magnetic disc, having a sliding shutter 
capable of covering and uncovering an opening defined for 
recording or reproducing signals therethrough to or from the 
disc, and more particularly, to such a disc cartridge 
apparatus wherein the sliding shutter is installed in the 
cartridge in capable of sliding between a position where it 
covers the opening and another position spaced in one 
direction and another direction from the covering position, 
where it uncovers the opening. Conventionally a disc cartridge rotatably accommodates a 
circular disc such as an optical recording disc, a 
magneto-optic recording disc and a magnetic disc in a 
cartridge main body comprising an upper and a lower 
case-halves which are butt-joined with each other. In the 
cartridge main body accommodating the circular disc as 
mentioned above, an opening confronting an optical pickup for 
recording or reproducing of an information signal to or from 
a disc is defined in the main body in extending in the radial 
direction from nearly the center of the disc. The opening 
also confronts a disc turntable of a disc driving apparatus  
 
for rotating the disc with the optical pickup. Further on 
the cartridge main body, a shutter formed by a thin metal 
plate or an engineering plastics for opening and closing the 
opening, is installed in capable of sliding. Now, the sliding shutter installed therein is so arranged 
that the sliding shutter will be located on a position where 
the opening is covered for protection the disc when the 
cartridge main body is not loaded into an information 
recording reproducing apparatus containing the disc driving 
apparatus. For the object, a spring which gives the sliding 
shutter a bias force in the direction toward the covering 
position is provided in the cartridge main body. Further in 
a cartridge wherein a sliding shutter is arranged to slide in 
both directions from a central position where it covers the 
opening to uncover the opening, the cartridge is further 
provided with a locking mechanism for preventing the sliding 
motion of the sliding shutter at the covering position. 
Further when the cartridge is loaded into an information 
recording reproducing apparatus, the opening must be 
uncovered by easily and accurately sliding the sliding 
shutter.
