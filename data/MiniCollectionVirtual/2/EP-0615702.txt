<ABSTRACT>
A method and apparatus for making banded smoking article 
wrappers is disclosed. The apparatus includes a cylindrical 

rotating applicator 60 that has alternating regions 64 of mesh 
material and regions 66 of solid material on its outside surface 

51. The applicator allows repetitive patterns of additional slurry 
to be applied to a continuous web of paper so that the basis weight 

of the paper is repetitively increased. Such paper, when 
incorporated into a smoking article, modifies the burn rate 

characteristics of the article.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a method and apparatus for making
banded wrappers. More particularly, the invention
relates to a method and apparatus for applying cellulosic slurry in
repetitive patterns to paper for making banded smoking article
wrappers.Smoking article manufacturers have long appreciated the
usefulness of adding flavorings or burn control additives to
smoking article paper. More recently, it has been recognized that
smoking article paper could be altered so that smoking articles
incorporating the altered paper will have a reduced burn rate when
the smoking article is not drawn on by a smoker.Paper smoking article wrappers have burn characteristics,
including burn rates and static burn capabilities. It is known
that burn characteristics can be modified by adding fillers,
coatings, or other additives to papers. Copending, commonly-assigned
United States patent application Serial No. 07/614,620,
filed November 16, 1990 includes a description of many of these
methods, and also discloses a nonlaminated paper of variable basis
weight having modified burn rate characteristics. The methods and
apparatus disclosed in that application, however, are not the only
solutions for making banded smoking article wrappers with modified
burn rate characteristics.It would be desirable to provide a method and apparatus for
making banded smoking article wrappers with modified burn rate
characteristics.It would also be desirable to provide a method and apparatus
for efficiently making such wrappers.In accordance with the invention there is provided a method
of applying a fluidized material (e.g., a cellulosic slurry) to a
substrate
comprising a web of pulp
(e.g., a continuous web of smoking article wrapper
paper) . The method includes the steps of: (a) moving the substrate
along a path; (b) providing a cylindrical surface having 
alternating regions of mesh material separated by regions of solid
material; (c) applying the fluidized material to the cylindrical
surface; (d) providing a vacuum on an underside of the mesh
material so as to allow the fluidized material to adhere to the
alternating regions of mesh material; (e) rotating said cylindrical
surface so that the adhered fluidized material is positioned
adjacent the substrate; and (f) providing pressure on the underside
of the mesh material to release the adhered fluidized material from
the mesh material, wherein the released fluidized material attaches
to the substrate. The substrate can then be formed in smoking
article wrappers having repetitive regions of

<CLAIMS>
A method of applying a fluidized material to a substrate comprising
a web of pulp (21) (90), the method comprising:


(a) moving the substrate along a path;
(b) providing a cylindrical surface (51) having alternating regions
(64) of mesh separated by regions (66) of solid material and having an axis

of rotation extending generally across the path of the substrate, the
surface being disposed generally tangentially to the path;
(c) applying fluidized material to one side of the outer
cylindrical surface;
(d) providing a vacuum on the inner surface of the mesh material
so as to allow the fluidized material to adhere to the regions of mesh;
(e) rotating the cylindrical surface so that the adhered fluidized
material is positioned adjacent the substrate; and
(f) providing pressure on the inner surface of the mesh to release
the adhered fluidized material from the mesh, whereby the released

fluidized material attaches to the substrate.
A method according to claim 1 including the step of cleaning the mesh
after the adhered fluidized material releases from the mesh and before

additional fluidized material is applied to the cylindrical surface (51).
A method according to claim 1 or 2 in which the substrate (21) (90)
is moved at a speed substantially synchronized with the rotation of the

cylindrical surface (51).
A method according to any preceding claim in which the substrate (21)
(90) comprises paper.
A method according to claim 4 in which the substrate comprises a roll
of premanufactured paper.
A method according to claim 4 or 5 in which the fluidized material
comprises a slurry for altering burn rate characteristics of the paper web.
A method according to claim 6 in which the slurry is a cellulosic 
slurry.
A method according to any of claims 4 to 7 further comprising:

drying the paper; and
severing the web of paper to form individual smoking article
wrappers.
A method according to any of claims 4 to 7 further comprising:

drying the paper;
wrapping the paper around smoking material such as tobacco to form
a continuous rod of smoking article material; and
severing the continuous rod to form individual smoking articles.
A method according to any preceding claim in which the regions (64)
of mesh are substantially rectangular and have a width of from about 2 mm

to about 8 mm.
A method according to any preceding claim in which the regions (66)
of solid material are substantially rectangular and have a width of from

about 12 mm to about 20 mm so that adjacent regions (64) of mesh are
separated from each other by a distance of from about 12 mm to about 20 mm.
A method according to any preceding claim including the step of
cleaning the mesh after the cellulosic slurry releases from the mesh

material and before additional cellulosic slurry is applied to the
cylindrical surface.
Apparatus for applying a fluidized material to a substrate comprising
a web of pulp (21)(90), the apparatus comprising:


a stationary inner valve (62) having a surface that is substantially
cylindrical, the surface having a first cavity (54A) and a second cavity

(52C), the second cavity being adapted for placement in a region adjacent
the substrate;
a vacuum port (54) for applying vacuum to the first cavity;
a pressure port (52) for applying pressure to the second cavity;
a cylindrical applicator (60) rotatable on the surface of the inner
valve (62) and having an inner surface and an outer surface (51), the

applicator having a plurality of spaced channels (72) (74) between the 
inner surface and the outer surface for providing fluid communication

therebetween, the outer surface having regions (64) of mesh covering the
channels to form alternating regions of mesh and regions (66) of solid

material; and
a coater (46) for applying the fluidised material to the outer
surface (51) of the applicator (60), the coater being positioned in a

region adjacent the first cavity (54A) so that the vacuum can cause the
applied fluidized material to adhere to the mesh, so that as the applicator

(60) rotates, fluidized material is:

(1) applied to the mesh (64) by the coater (46);
(2) held in place by the vacuum; and
(3) rotated into a region adjacent the second cavity (52C) so that
pressure communicated through the spaced channels (72) (74) causes the

fluidized material to release from the mesh and deposit onto the substrate
(21)(90) as it moves along a path adjacent the applicator.
Apparatus according to claim 13 further including a cleaner for

cleaning the mesh after the adhered fluidized material releases from the
mesh and before additional fluidized material is applied to the cylindrical
