<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an oxide
superconductor and a method of preparing the same, and
more particularly, it relates to an oxide superconductor
having a high superconductivity transition temperature (Tc
= 134 K) exceeding the liquid nitrogen temperature and a
method of preparing the same.A superconductor has unique properties of its own
such as zero electrical resistance, complete diamagnetism
and a Josephson effect. Due to such properties, wide
applications of superconductors are expected in relation
to power transportation, a generator, nuclear fusion
plasma confinement, a magnetic levitation train, a
magnetic shield, a high-speed computer and the like.In 1986, Bednorz and Müller discovered an oxide
superconductor (La1-XBaX)2CuO4 having a high
superconductivity transition temperature Tc of about 30 K.
Following this discovery, there have been reported oxide
superconductors having high superconductivity transition
temperatures Tc such as YBa2Cu3O7 (Tc = 90 K), Bi-Sr-Ca-Cu-O 
(Tc = 110 K) and Tl-Ba-Ca-Cu-O (Tc = 125 K). Many
researches are now being made in relation to methods of
preparing such superconductors, physical properties and
applications thereof and the like.In the process of such researches, a superconductor
having a superconductivity transition temperature Tc of
133.5 K has recently been confirmed in relation to Hg-Ba-Ca-Cu-O
ceramics (A. Schilling et al., Nature 363 (1993)
56).As to the superconductor exhibiting a
superconductivity transition temperature Tc of 133.5 K, it
is inferred from observation of its lattice image with a
transmission electron microscopy that a substance
expressed in a chemical formula HgBa2Ca2Cu3OY (Y: arbitrary
number) having such a crystal structure that eight atomic
layers of HgOZ-BaO-CuO2-Ca-CuO2-Ca-CuO2-BaO are stacked
exhibits the high superconductivity transition temperature
Tc. However, no crystal structure of a superconducting
crystal phase has been clarified with respect to this
superconductor.A. Schilling et al. further reported that they
prepared the superconductor by preparing Ba2CaCu2OY as a
precursor, mixing the same with HgO, vacuum-sealing the
mixture in a silica tube, introducing the silica tube into
a steel container and firing the same at 800°C for 5 
hours. However, they clarified no mixing ratio of the
precursor to HgO. Further, they reported that the silica
tube which was introduced into the steel container was
cracked after firing, and it was difficult to reproduce
their experiment.Although the superconductor having a
