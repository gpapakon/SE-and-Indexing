<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to compositions useful for the treatment of
Diabetes Mellitus. More specifically, the present invention relates to compositions to
prolong the administration of glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1), and derivatives thereof.
These compositions are useful in treatment of Non-Insulin Dependent Diabetes Mellitus
(NIDDM).The amino acid sequence of GLP-1 is known as:
GLP-1 is disclosed by Lopez, L.C., etal., P.N.A.S., USA 80: 5485-5489 (1983);
Bell, G.I., etal., Nature 302: 716-718 (1983); Heinrich, G. etal., Endocrinol. 115: 2176-2181
(1984) and Ghiglione, M., etal., Diabetologia 27: 599-600 (1984).During processing in the pancreas and intestine, GLP-1 is converted to a 31
amino acid peptide having amino acids 7-37 of GLP-1, hereinafter this peptide is
referred to as GLP-1 (7-37).This peptide has been shown to have insulinotropic activity, that is, it is able to
stimulate, or cause to be stimulated, the synthesis or expression of the hormone insulin.
Because of this insulinotropic activity, GLP-1 (7-37) is alternatively referred to as
insulinotropin.GLP-1 (7-37) has the following amino acid sequence:
GLP-1 (7-37), certain derivatives thereof and the use thereof to treat Diabetes
mellitus in a mammal are disclosed in United States Patent Numbers 5,118,666 ('666
patent) and 5,120,712 (712 patent).The derivatives of GLP-1 (7-37) disclosed in the '666 and '712
patents include polypeptides which contain or lack one of more amino acids that may
not be present in the naturally occurring sequence. Further derivatives of GLP-1 (7-37)
disclosed in the '666 and '712 patents include certain C-terminal salts, esters and
amides where the salts and esters are defined as OM where M is a pharmaceutically 
acceptable cation or a lower (C1-C6) branched or unbranched alkyl group and the
amides are defined as -NR2R3 where R2 and R3 are the same or different and are
selected from the group consisting of hydrogen and a lower (C1-C6) branched or
unbranched alkyl group.Certain other polypeptides, alternatively referred to as truncated GLP-1 or
truncated insulinotropin, having insulinotropic activity and the derivatives thereof are
disclosed in PCT/US 89/01121 (WO 90/11296). Those polypeptides, referred to therein
as GLP-1 (7-36), GLP-1 (7-35) and GLP-1 (7-34) have the following amino acid
sequences, respectively.

and
Derivatives of the polypeptides disdosed in WO 90/11296 include
polypeptides having inconsequential amino acid substitutions, or additional amino acids
to enhance coupling to carrier protein or
