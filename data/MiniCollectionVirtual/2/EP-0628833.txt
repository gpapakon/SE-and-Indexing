<ABSTRACT>
A battery monitor system for monitoring the residual 
capacity of a battery has a controller for determining 

the residual capacity of a battery, detecting the output 
electric energy of the battery when the battery is discharged, 

and correcting the residual capacity depending on 
the output electric energy such that as the output electric 

energy of the battery increases, a new residual capacity produced 
when the residual capacity is corrected decreases. The 

residual capacity may be corrected by subtracting a residual 
capacity corrective value which increases as the output electric 

energy of the battery increases, from the residual capacity. 
The residual capacity of the battery can accurately 

be determined and monitored depending on the output electric 
energy from the battery. In the case where the battery monitor 

system has a residual capacity display unit and is combined 
with an electric vehicle, the driver of the electric 

vehicle can visually recognize the residual capacity of the 
battery depending on the running condition of the electric 

vehicle.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a battery monitor
system for monitoring the residual capacity of a battery such
as a lead storage battery mounted on an electric vehicle or
the like.Electric vehicles are propelled by an electric motor
which is supplied with required electric energy from a
battery such as a lead storage battery. It has been customary
to detect the residual capacity of the battery, i.e., the
amount of electric energy that can be discharged from the
battery, according to any of various processes on a real-time
basis, and display the detected residual capacity on a suitable
display unit in the passenger's compartment for recognition
by the driver.One of the known processes for determining the
residual capacity of the battery on a real-time basis is disclosed
in Japanese laid-open patent publication No. 1-143984,
for example. According to the disclosed process, the current
discharged from the battery while the electric vehicle is
running is detected from time to time, and the detected current
is integrated. The integrated value is then subtracted
from the initial capacity of the battery before the battery
starts being discharged, i.e., before the electric vehicle 
starts running, and the differential value is corrected depending
on the temperature of the battery, thereby determining
the residual capacity of the battery.The inventor has found out that the residual capacity
of the battery generally varies depending on the output
voltage of the battery at the time it is discharged, and that
the higher the output voltage, the lower the substantial
residual capacity of the battery. Electric vehicles are generally
controlled such that the electric power supplied from
the battery to the electric motor, i.e., the output electric
power from the battery, while the electric vehicle is running
is higher causing an increase in the mechanical output
power from the electric motor as the driver depresses the
accelerator pedal more deeply. Therefore, it is preferable
for the driver to recognize the residual capacity of the battery
depending on the present amount of operation of the accelerator
pedal or the present depth to which the accelerator
pedal is depressed, i.e., the present output electric power
of the battery. If informed of the residual capacity of the
battery depending on the present output electric power of
the battery, then the driver can recognize how far the electric
vehicle can travel with the present rate of accelerator
pedal depression, and hence can appropriately depress the accelerator
ped
