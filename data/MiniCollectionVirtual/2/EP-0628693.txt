<ABSTRACT>
In order to be able to mount a corner angle (1), which is inserted into a fitting-part groove (12, 13), with the aid of fastening screws (24), which are screwed into the groove base (11), said screws being subjected to the lowest possible degree of loading, the end regions (7, 8) of the angle legs (5, 6) of the corner angle (1) are bent around inwards through approximately 180@ such that the free end (21, 22) of the bent-over region (7, 8) runs approximately parallel to the non-deformed part of its angle leg (5, 6) and can be supported on the groove base. Coaxially provided through-passage bores (23 and 25) make it possible to screw the angle fixedly at its bent-over regions (7, 8), with the result that the fastening screw is in each case subjected only to shearing loading.

<CLAIMS>
Leaf (4) of a window, a door or the like, which is provided on at least one external corner with a corner angle (1) of the leaf fitment situated on a fitment portion or connected to a fitment portion for at least rotatable mounting of the leaf (4) on a fixed frame, whereby the leaf is provided at least in the region of the external corner accommodating the corner angle (1) with a fitment portion groove (12, 13) which is open towards the fixed frame and which increases in width on the outside in stepped manner, whereby furthermore the corner angle (1) lies with its planar angle limbs (5, 6) on the two parallel steps (16) of the fitment portion groove (12, 13) and is fixed to the leaf (4) by means of fixing screws (24) which are screwed into the bottom (11) of the groove, 
characterised in that
 the end regions (7, 8) of the angle limbs (5, 6) of the corner angle (1) are bent over inwardly through approximately 180Â° such that the free end (21, 22) of the bent-over region (7, 8) extends parallel to the undeformed portion of its angle limb (5, 6) and faces towards the respective other angle limb (6, 5), that the free limb end (21, 22) and the undeformed portion of the angle limb are provided with aligned-through bores (23, 25) for respective fixing screws (24), wherein the width of the bent-over end region (7, 8) corresponds to the groove width in the region of the stepped groove narrowing (18) and the separation of the support surface of the free end (21, 22) from the associated parallel angle limb (5, 6) corresponds to the depth of the fitment portion groove from the support surface of the steps (16), so that the free end (21, 22) of the bent-over end region (7, 8) rests against the groove bottom (11), that the angle limbs (5, 6) are accommodated
 fully over their entire length by the fitment portion groove (12, 13), that the external surfaces of the two angle limbs (5, 6) each run flush with the associated beam surface (19, 20) of the leaf (4) and that the width of the corner angle (1) is reduced in the immediate region of the corner angle (29) by means of two mutually opposed recesses (26, 27), whereby the size of the recesses (26, 27) corresponds at least to the cross-section of a weld bead (30) which may arise on the external corner of the leaf (4).
Leaf according to claim 1, 
characterised in that
 at least one bearing sleeve (2) is attached to the angle limb (5) which is vertical in the position of use, in order to comprise one half of a rotary mounting (3).
