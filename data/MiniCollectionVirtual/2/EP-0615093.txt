<ABSTRACT>
In order to create an indicator (100) for pressurised air bottles (10; 31; 50) or the like for indicating the fall of pressure below a defined level in the pressurised air bottle (10; 31; 50), which indicator (100) guarantees the simplest recognition as to whether a pressurised air bottle has the requisite pressure and which prevents an error source for pressure drops from arising due to the pressure measurement, it is proposed that at least a certain part (23; 36; 52) of the wall of the pressurised air bottle (10; 31; 50) be put on in such a way that this part is flexible so that this part of the wall is subjected to certain different deformations at different pressures.

Indicator (100) on a compressed air cylinder (50) 
or suchlike for indicating the falling below of a 

defined pressure in the compressed air cylinder (50), 
in which case at least a certain portion (52) of the 

wall of the compressed air cylinder (50) is constructed 
in such a way that the same is flexible so that 

this portion of the wall, at varying pressures, is 
subject to different deformations, and an indicator 

element (63;76) is provided, which is connected to 
the flexible portion (52) of the wall of the compressed 

air cylinder (50) in such a manner that the same, 
in dependence of the deformation of the flexible portion 

(52), assumes different positions,
 
characterized in that
 
the compressed air cylinder (50) possesses a bottleneck-like 

aperture (51) with an external thread (54), 
which is sealed with a metal foil (52) that is rigidly 

connected with the upper circumferential edge (53) 
of the aperture (51), while a sealing cap (55) is 

screwed on to the thread (54) of the threaded aperture 
(51), in that the sealing cap (55) is centrically 

provided with a through bore (56;66) which 
narrows down from the inside towards the outside in 

two stages, while, in the widest stage (57;67) of 
the through bore (56;66), a first cylindrical element 

(58;68) is fitted which rests upon the metal 
foil (52) and is, in its centre, provided with a second 

cylindrical element (59;69), which possesses 
the same diameter as the narrowest portion of the 

through bore (56;66), in which case the metal foil 
(52), which constitutes the flexible wall portion 

of the compressed air cylinder (50), in the  
 

unfilled state of the compressed air cylinder (50), 
is curved in the direction of the interior (51) of 

the compressed air cylinder (50) so that the second 
cylindrical element (59;69) releases the indicator 

element (63;76) or is separated from the indicator 
element (63;76). 
Indicator according to Claim 1,
 
characterized in that,
 
in the centrical part (60) of the through bore (56), 

a spiral spring (61) is fitted which encloses the 
cylindrical element (59) and which is supported on 

the cylindrical element (58) and the sealing cap 
(55) and in that the second cylindrical element (59) 

is dimensioned in its length in such a way that the 
circular area (62) visible from the through bore 

(56), in the unfilled state of the compressed air 
cylinder (50), terminates flush with the sealing 

cap (55), while, on to the circular area (62), in 
the form of an indicator element, a small indicator 

plate (63) is adhesively affixed which possesses a 
larger diameter than the through bore (56). 
Indicator according to Claim 1,
 
characterized in that
 
the lateral wall (72) of the sealing cap (55) is 

constructed so as to project above the cover area 
(65) provided with the through bore (66) so that an 

internal space (73) is formed which is covered by a 
closing plate (74), which is rigidly connected to 

the lateral wall (72) of the sealing cap (55) and 
which possesses a centrical through bore (77), 

while, into the internal space (73), a cylindrically 
configured indicator element (76) is inserted,  

 
the external diameter of which corresponds to that 

of the through bore (77) in the closing plate (74) 
and which possesses at least one unilaterally projecting 

locking element (80,81,82,83) which is elastically 
secured to the indicator element and presses 

a contact area (86) gripping behind a retaining section 
(87) of the closing plate (74) and is disposed 

so as to be swivellable into a release position, 
each locking element (80,81,82,83) being blockable 

by the second cylindrical element (69) in its position 
wherein it mountingly secures the second cylindrical 

element (76) and in that, between the first 
cylindrical element (68) and the indicator element 

(76), a spiral spring (71) is located, with the aid 
of which constant pressure is exerted upon the indicator 

element (76), which, however, is held in 
position by the locking element or elements (80,81, 

82,83) when the c ompresssed air cylinder is filled. 
Indicator according to either Claim 2 or 3,
 
characterized in that
 
the through bore (77) in the closing plate (74) is 

constructed so as to become narrower un two stages, 
in that the external diameter of the indicator element 

(76) corresponds to the narrower portion (78) 
of the through bore (77) in the closing plate (74) 

and in that the transitional region between the 
wider part (79) of the through bore (77) and the 

narrower portion (78) of the through bore (77) constructed 
in the form of an oblique area (87) constitutes 

the retaining section upon which the contact 
area (86) of each locking element (80,81,82,83) is 

supported in its position wherein it secures the 
indicator element (76).  

 
Indicator according to any of Claims 2 to 4,
 
characterized in that
 
four locking elements (80,81,82,83) are provided 

which are swivellably arranged on the indicator element, 
each of which is constructed so as to form a 

locking member swivellable from the wall plane forming 
a section of the outer wall (84) of the hollow 

cylindrical indicator element (76), with a bearing 
portion (89) disposed on a free terminal edge (88) 

with the contact area (86).
