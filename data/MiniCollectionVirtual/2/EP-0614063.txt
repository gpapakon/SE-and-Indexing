<ABSTRACT>
A manifold (18) for a heat exchanger (14) includes a rear wall (76) 
provided with inlet and outlet ports (78, 82), a front wall (86) provided 

with a water inlet (90) and a water outlet (94), and a web (98) extending 
between the front and rear walls (76, 86) and arranged such that water 

entering through the water inlet (90) communicates only with the outlet 
ports (82) and water entering through the inlet ports (78) communicates 

only with the water outlet (94).

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to heat exchangers with multiple heating
tubes, and more particularly to heat exchangers including compact
manifolds for use with multiple identical heating tubes.JP-A-4155195, which represents the closest prior art document, describes a heat exchanger with a manifold
including a plurality of outlet ports for communication with the inlets of
heating tubes and a plurality of inlet ports for communication with the
outlets of heating tubes. The manifold further includes an inlet and an
outlet, and a partition whereby the inlet communicates only with the
outlet ports and the outlet communicates only with the inlet ports. The
inlet and outlet are spaced apart from one another by a relatively great
distance, thus the manifold is not compact.DE 2940035 and DE 1632421 illustrate a heat exchanger
arrangements in which fluid from a manifold passes through first straight
sections of a plurality of heating tubes and returns to the manifold
through second straight sections of the tubes.An object of the invention is to provide a heat exchanger with
multiple identical heating tubes, the heat exchanger including a compact
manifold.Another object of the invention is the provision of such a
manifold that equally balances water flow through each of the heating
tubes.Another object of the invention is the provision of such a
manifold where both the manifold water inlet and the manifold water
outlet are sufficiently large so as to permit a substantial amount of water
flow through all of the heating tubes. According to the present invention there is provided a heat
exchanger comprising:
a plurality of heating tubes having respective inlets and outlets,
anda manifold having a horizontal longitudinal axis and a
horizontal plane which includes said longitudinal axis and which divides
said manifold into an upper manifold half and a lower manifold half,
said manifold including a rear wall having therein a plurality of inlet
ports, each of which is connected to said outlet of one of said heating
tubes, said inlet ports being generally equally spaced along said rear wall
in said upper manifold half, said rear wall also having therein a plurality
of outlet ports, each of which is connected to said inlet of one of said
heating tubes, said outlet ports being generally equally spaced along said
rear wall in said lower manifold half, a front wall opposed to said rear
wall, said front wall having therein a water inlet and a water outlet and a
web which extends between said front and rear walls, which is attached
to

<CLAIMS>
A heat exchanger comprising:

a plurality of heating tubes (22) having respective inlets and
outlets, and
a manifold (18) having a horizontal longitudinal axis (66) and a
horizontal plane (68) which includes said longitudinal axis (66) and

which divides said manifold (18) into an upper manifold half (70) and a
lower manifold half (74), said manifold (18) including a rear wall (76)

having therein a plurality of inlet ports (78), each of which is connected
to said outlet of one of said heating tubes (22), said inlet ports (78) being

generally equally spaced along said rear wall (76) in said upper manifold
half (70), said rear wall (76) also having therein a plurality of outlet ports

(82), each of which is connected to said inlet of one of said heating
tubes (22), said outlet ports (82) being generally equally spaced along

said rear wall (76) in said lower manifold half (74), a front wall (86)
opposed to said rear wall (76), said front wall (86) having therein a water

inlet (90) and a water outlet (94) and a web (98) which extends between
said front and rear walls (76, 86), which is attached to said front wall

(86) above said water inlet (90) and below said water outlet (94) so as to
separate said water inlet (90) and said water outlet (94), and which is

attached to said rear wall (76) along a horizontal line separating said
inlet and outlet ports (78, 82) so that water entering through said water

inlet (90) communicates only with said outlet ports (82) and water
entering through said inlet ports (78) communicates only with said water

outlet (94), and characterized in that the water inlet (90) and water outlet
(94) are spaced from one another along said axis (66) and open into both 

said upper manifold half (70) and said lower manifold half (74), said web
(98) being of involute form, and being of non-uniform cross-sectional

shape in planes normal to the longitudinal axis (66).
A heat exchanger as claimed in Claim 1, characterized in that
said inlet ports (78) have centers lying on a first horizontal line (83A),

and wherein said outlet ports (82) have centers lying on a second
horizontal line (83B) spaced below said first line (83A).
A heat exchanger as claimed in Claim 1 or Claim 2,
characterized in that said heating tubes (22) are substantially identical

and each comprises an upper straight section (50), a lower straight
section (46), and an elbow section (54) connecting said straight sections

(46, 50).
A heat exchanger as claimed in any one of the preceding
claims, characterized in that said web (98) is integral with said front and

rear walls (76, 86).
