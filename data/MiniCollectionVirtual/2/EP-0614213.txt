<ABSTRACT>
A system and a method for washing objects, such as 
cassettes and carriers used to hold and transport silicon 

wafers during manufacture of semiconductor chips. The 
method employs the steps of exposing the objects to 

ultraviolet radiation in a process chamber, spraying of 
developer fluid onto the objects, rinsing the objects, 

spraying of surfactant solution onto the objects, rinsing 
the objects and drying the objects using heated, filtered 

and ionized ultra low particle air (ULPA)

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates generally to an automated
washing system and method, and more specifically to such a
system and method for washing semiconductor wafer cassettes
and carriers.Cassettes and carriers which are used to hold and
transport silicon wafers for photolithographic processing
become contaminated with resist flakes. Failure to clean
these resist flakes from the cassettes and carriers results
in these flakes being transferred to the wafers during
subsequent processing operations. These transferred resist
flakes are a major source of photolithographic defects,
referred to as defects without inclusion.Current systems available commercially are of two basic
design types: hot deionized water and surfactant spray
systems which are effective for normal particle removal, but
which are not capable of removing resist flakes from
cassettes; and solvent-based systems which are effective
for both particle removal and resist removal. The first
system mentioned above has the drawback of only removing
particles. Removing resist flakes from contaminated parts
is done by immersion and/or manual scrubbing with a resist
removing solvent. The second system mentioned above has the
disadvantage of the requirement for special handling and
disposal of the resist removal solvents.EP-A-0 252 439 discloses an apparatus for surface treating of
objects including means for applying ultraviolet radiation to the object
and nozzles for applying liquids to the object.It is an object of the present invention to
specifically address the hazards and disposal issues
associated with solvent use, and provide a system which is
capable of cleaning particulates that normally accumulate on
the cassettes and carriers from processing equipment, and
which is further capable of removing resist flakes without
the use of solvents.According to a first aspect of the present invention
there is provided a method of automated washing of one or
more objects, comprising the following steps: 
(a) placing the objects to be washed in a chamber; (b) exposing the objects to ultraviolet radiation to
break down any resist contaminants present on said objects;(c) applying photo resist developer fluid to the objects in
order to remove any resist contaminants present on said
objects;(d) rinsing the resist developer residue from the
objects;(e) applying surfactant solution to the objects in
order to remove any particulate contaminants present on said
objects;(f) rinsing the surfactant solution from the objects;
and(g) blowing air into the chamber to dry
