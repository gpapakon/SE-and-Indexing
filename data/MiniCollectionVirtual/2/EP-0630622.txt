<CLAIMS>
A process for producing ceramic dental prostheses,
characterized by


(a) shaping a porous unfinished piece made out of (in
percent by weight) 92.1% to 93.5% zirconium oxide

(ZrO
2
), yttrium oxide 4.5% to 5.5% (Y
2
O
3
) and
hafnium oxide 1.8% to 2.2% (HfO
2
), third oxides as
rest at most 0.2%, and
(b) dense vertrification or infiltration of the
unfinished piece, and
(c) reworking the unfinished piece to a dental
prosthesis by means of a rotating tool made of

metal-bonded diamond grains with speeds of 10,000
to 50,000 millimeters per minute, infeeds of 0.1

to 0.5 millimeters per minute, advance speeds of
0.3 to 3.0 centimeters per second, and surface

speeds for the tool of 0.5 to 9.0 m/sec.
A process in accordance with Claim 1, characterized by
the fact that the unfinished piece is correspondingly

preshaped to the dental prosthesis.
A process in accordance with Claim 1, characterized by
te fact that the unfinished piece is made as an

unfinished prosthesis by slip casting, then dried,
baked, redensified heat-isostatically, and then

retreated by oxidizing.
A process in accordance with one of the Claims 1 to 3,
characterized by the fact that the reworking is 

carried out by means of digital acquisition and
calculation of the mass of a prosthesis model,

inputting the acquisition and calculation data into a
data-processing control unit, and outputting the data

to a processing device movable in three dimensions in
order to move the workpiece.
