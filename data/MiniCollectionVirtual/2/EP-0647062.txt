<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to devices for use in video
applications, and particularly, to video signal filters.In video applications, it is often desirable to change the
contrast and luminance associated with an imaged picture
because, due to increased variation in the brilliance of
the picture relative to the sensitivity of the means
provided to pick up or store it, details in highly
brilliant or very dark areas (of the picture) may fail to
be adequately brought out.It should not be overlooked that contrast is related to the
details of an image, while luminance contains brilliance
information associated with the image itself.To modify the contrast and luminance associated with an
image, and accordingly solve this problem, two main
directions can be followed which are both known from
literature.In a first of these directions, the image is defined as the
product of an illumination component i(y,x) from the light
impinging on a picture being imaged and a reflectance
component r(y,x) from the light being reflected by objects
within said picture, namely:
f(y,x) = i(y,x) r(y,x)
where, f(y,x) is the image to be processed, identified as a
function of two variables y and x representing the spatial
co-ordinates of each of the punctual elements or pixels
which make up the image.In the above definition of an image, the illumination
component i(y,x) is responsible for most of the change in 
brilliance, whilst the reflectance component contains
detail information.The illumination component i(y,x), being tied to the image
brilliance, represents the luminance in the above
definition of an image, while the reflectance component,
being tied to the image details, represents the contrast.Thus, the luminance and contrast associated with an image
can be modified by acting on the components i(y,x) and
r(y,x).The aim is to reduce the illumination component i(y,x) and
amplify the reflectance component r(y,x).To accomplish this, linear filters are employed which are
usually of the high-pass type and operate in the density
domain.It should be considered that illumination i(y,x) varies
slowly in space, and therefore, mostly contains low spatial
frequencies present in an image, whereas reflectance, being
a process of the high-pass type, mostly contains high
spatial frequencies.In order to work with linear filters of the high-pass type,
a logarithmic transform of the illumination and reflectance
components is to be used whereby the filtering operation
can be made linear, that is:
f'(y,x) = log[f(y,x)] = Ã¬(y,x) + r'(y,x)
