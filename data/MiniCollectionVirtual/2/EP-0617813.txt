<ABSTRACT>
Method of, and apparatus for, providing direct automatic access of a calendar task from a non-calendar task, which substantially reduces the difficulties of conventional systems. The invention allows a user to place a cursor under a date in a non-calendar task and press a date selection key. When the date is selected in this way, the calendar task is invoked, and the user's calendar for that date is displayed to the user. When the user exits the calendar task, the user is returned to the non-calendar task. Another aspect of this invention is that the user can alternatively use a special selection mode and select the non-calendar task object containing the date instead of the date contained within such non-calendar task object to automatically access the calendar task.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates in general to calendar 
processing, and in particular to a method of, and 
apparatus for, providing direct automatic access of a 
calendar task for a date appearing in a non-calendar 
task without the necessity of either specifying the 
date, re-entering the date, or first exiting the 
non-calendar task. Conventional systems may provide both calendar tasks 
and non-calendar tasks such as electronic mail, editor, 
spreadsheet, database, etc. However, when both types of 
tasks are provided, no convenient user-friendly technique 
is available for accessing the calendar tasks directly 
from the non-calendar tasks. This is a problem when information 
prompting a user's need of the calendar tasks 
resides in the non-calendar tasks. Hereinafter, task means one or more sequences of instructions 
treated as an element of work to be accomplished 
by a computer system, including, but not limited 
to, operating system, control program, application program, 
module, procedure, routine, and subroutine. Hereinafter, 
user means anyone who, or anything that, requires 
the services of a computer system, including, but not 
limited to, programmer, operator, secretary, computer 
system, task, operating system, control program, application  
 
program, module, procedure, routine, and subroutine. For a situation which may call for a user needing 
access to a calendar task, consider an electronic mail 
document including a date. When such a date appears 
within the text of the electronic mail document, the 
user may wish to view his/her schedule for that date. 
In the prior art, the user would first have to note the 
date within the text in the electronic mail document. 
The user would then have to exit the electronic mail. 
The user next would have to request the calendar tasks. 
Finally, the user would have to specify the desired 
date to the calendar tasks in order to view his/her 
schedule for that date. The prior art approach presents the user with four 
difficulties. The first difficulty is the user having 
to know the sequence of steps necessary to exit the 
non-calendar task, request the calendar task, and 
return to the non-calendar task. The second difficulty 
is the number of keystrokes or selections the user has 
to make to accomplish this sequence. The third 
difficulty is that the user has to either re-key or 
identify the date to the calendar task. The fourth 
difficulty is that the user must contend with having to 
translate dates from multiple formats into the format 
required by the

selecting by the user a date within said non-calendar task, 

comprises the steps of: 

selecting by the user a non-calendar task object containing 
said date; and 
automatically searching for said date. 
A method according to claim 1, wherein the step of 
selecting by the user a date within said non-calendar task, 

comprises the steps of: 

selecting by the user a non-calendar task object containing 
said date;

automatic access to a calendar task from a non-calendar 

task comprising: 

means for selecting by the user a date within said non-calendar 
task; and 
means responsive to said selecting said date for 
automatically causing said calendar task to be invoked 
thereby displaying the user's calendar for said selected 
date and providing the user with the possibility of 

performing desired schedule tasks including viewing and 
editing.
