<ABSTRACT>
The spring (90) includes a feeler element (94) interacting by sliding over a bearing surface 80a of the moving contact (22) so as to alter the point of application (103) of the pressure force P in the second active repulsion position, entailing a reduction in the return torque before action by the mechanism (58). The moving contact (22) is fork-shaped, being articulated on an eccentric spindle (84) parallel to the axis of rotation of the bar (70). The spiral spring (90) is mounted floating in the hollow (92) of the bar (70), and comprises two helical windings (90a), (90b) of metal wire.

A current-limiting circuit breaker with moulded insulating case (12), housing : 

a current interrupting device having per pole separable contact elements (22, 24, 
26) by electrodynamic repulsion, and at least one arc extinguishing chamber (74), 
an operating mechanism (58) with a toggle (60) associated with a connecting spring 
(72), and with a trip device (42), 
a switching bar (70) made of insulating material acting as support for the movable 
contacts (22) of all the poles, said bar being mechanically coupled to the toggle (60) 

to be moved by the mechanism (58) between the closed position and the open 
position of the contacts, 
a handle (62) coupled to the mechanism (58) and passing through an aperture (64) 
in the front panel of the case (12), 
the movable contact (22) of each pole being formed by a contact arm articulated on 
a spindle (84) securedly united to the bar (70), said movable contact (22) being able 

to be moved by electrodynamic repulsion from a first rest position to a second active 
position, and the spindle (84) of the movable contact (22) being eccentric with respect 

to the rotation axis of the bar (70), 
and flexible means comprising a spring (90) housed in a recess (92) of the bar (70) 
to provide the contact pressure and to slow down the drop-back of the movable 

contact (22) to the first rest position, the spring (90) cooperating with sliding with a 
bearing surface (80a) of the movable contact (22) to modify the application point 

(103) of the pressure force P in the course of the opening travel, 
 
characterized in that 


the movable contact (22) is shaped as a fork having a common body (80) 
supporting two contact arms (22a, 22b), and a securing shank (82) articulated on the 

spindle (84) and that the spirally-wound spring (90) is mounted floating in the recess 
(92) of the bar (70) and comprises a feeler part (94) cooperating with two balancing  

 
slots (96, 98) of the bearing surface (80a) securedly united to the body (80) to 

distribute the contact pressure on the two contact arms (22a, 22b). 
The circuit breaker according to claim 1, characterized in that the spirally-wound 
spring (90) comprises two helicoidal windings (90a, 90b) made of metallic wire 

arranged coaxially in the recess (92) and interconnected in the central zone by a 
protruding flexible link forming said feeler (94), and comprising two end strands (100, 

102) pressing against a wall of the bar (70). 
The circuit breaker according to claim 2, characterized in that the flexible link of the 
feeler (94) comprises a half-turn made of metallic wire having an upwardly-curved 

protruding part (94a). 
The circuit breaker according to claim 2 or 3, characterized in that the two windings 
(90a, 90b) of the spring (90) and the two contact arms (22a, 22b) of the fork-shaped 

contact (22) are disposed symmetrically in each pole with respect to the mid-plane 
passing through the securing shank (82). 
The circuit breaker according to one of the claims 1 to 4, characterized in that each 
slot (96, 98) is provided with latching surfaces to temporarily block the movable 

contact (22) in the second active position.
