<ABSTRACT>
Transmission frame comprising a latching line (00...0), synchronisation bits (1) and information bits (B1 to B62), a synchronisation bit being placed immediately after the latching line, characterised in that it is terminated by a synchronisation bit. Transmitter and receiver linked by a transmission channel transporting such frames.

Method for the transmission of frames of data, said frames including a locking row (00...0), synchronization bits (1) end data bits (B1 to 862), 
characterized in that
, said frames corresponding either to a full rate channel or to at least one low-rate subchannel each assigned its own synchronization pattern, said frames corresponding to said at least one low-rote subchannel terminate with a synchronization bit.
Method according to claim 1, wherein, said frames corresponding to said at least one low-rate subchannel terminating with alignment bits intended to be eliminated, on commando to bring about temporal alignment, and said synchronization bits having a value complementary to that of the bits of the locking row, said alignment bits have the same value as said synchronization bits.
Method according to claim 2, wherein the last of said alignment bits is eliminated, on command, only if the data bit preceding it has the value of a synchronization bit.
Transmitter for the transmission of frames of data each including a locking row (00...0), synchronization bits (1) and data bits (B1 to B62), 
characterized in that
, said frames corresponding either to a full rate channel or to at least one low-rate subchannel each assigned its own synchronization pattern, said transmitter comprises means for transmitting frames corresponding to said at least one low-rate subchannel terminating with a synchronization bit,
Transmitter according to claim 4, 
characterized in that
 it includes means for transmitting frames corresponding to said at least one low-rate subchannel terminating with alignment bits intended to be eliminated, on command, to bring about temporal alignment, said synchronization bits having a value complementary to that of the bits of the locking row, and said alignment bits having the same value as sold synchronization bits.
Transmitter according to claim 5, 
characterized in that
 it comprises means for eliminating the lost of said alignment bits, on command, only if the data bit preceding it has the value of a synchronization bit.
Receiver for the reception of frames of data each including a locking row (00...0), synchronization bits (1) and data bits, 
characterized in that
, said frames corresponding either to a full rate channel or to at least one low-rate subchannel each assigned its own synchronization pattern, and said frames corresponding to said at least one low-rate subchannel terminating with a synchronization bit, said
 receiver includes means for synchronization to any one caf the received frames.
Receiver according to claim 7, wherein, said synchronization bits having a value complementary to that of the bits of the locking row, said frames corresponding to said at least one low-rate subchannel terminate with alignment bits having the same value as said synchronization bits.
Receiver according to claim 8, wherein the last of said alignment bits is eliminated only if the data bit preceding it has the value of a synchronization bit.
