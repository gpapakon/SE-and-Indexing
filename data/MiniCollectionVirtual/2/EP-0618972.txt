 TITLECONSTITUTIVE EXPRESSION OF P450SOY AND FERREDOXIN-SOYIN STREPTOMYCES. AND BIOTRANSFORMATION OFCHEMICALS BY RECOMBINANT ORGANISMS FIELD OF THE INVENTIONThis invention relates to recombinant bacteria of the genus Strepto yces .capable of constitutive expression of cytochrome P450soy and the iron-sulfur protein that donates electrons to the cytochrome P450soy. These recombinant bacteria are useful in carrying out a number of important chemical conversions including biotransformation of HMPA and similar compounds.BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION Cytochrome P450 (P450) is a term used for a widely distributed group of unique heme proteins which form carbon monoxide complexes with a major absorption band at wavelengths around 450 nm. These proteins are enzymes which carry out oxidase functions in a wide variety of mixed function oxidase systems involved in biosynthesis and catabolism of specific cell or body components, and in the metabolism of foreign substances entering organisms. Oxygenating enzymes such as P450 appear to be fundamental cellular constituents in most forms of aerobic organisms. The activation of molecular oxygen and incorporation of one of its atoms into organic compounds by these enzymes are reactions of vital importance not only for biosynthesis, but also for metabolic activation or inactivation of foreign agents such as drugs, food preservatives and additives, insecticides, carcinogens and environmental pollutants.In eukaryotic systems P450, and P450 dependant enzymes are known to act on such xenobiotics and ' pharmaceuticals as phenobarbitol, antipyrine, haloperidol and prednisone. Known substrates of 

 environmental importance include compounds such as DDT, and a variety of polychlorinated biphenyls and polyaromatic hydrocarbons, as well as other halogenated compounds, including halobenzenes and chloroform. Hexamethylphosphoramide (HMPA) is a compound that was used heavily by industry in the mid-1970's in the production of aramid fibers and as a general solvent. HMPA is a known carcinogen and has been found to be one of the contaminants at various industrial and chemical waste sites. Studies focusing on the mammalian biodegradation of HMPA are few but it has been found that microsomal P450 isolated from rat liver and nasal mucosa will demethylate HMPA. Longo et al., Toxicol. Lett. 44:289 (1988) . In icrobial systems cytochrome P450 is known to oxidize many of the same xenobiotic substrates as in eukaryotic systems and thus can be targeted as possible indicators for the presence of
