<ABSTRACT>
The disclosed novel heterojunction bipolar transistor, to be referred to as 
the enhanced diffusion transistor (EDT), comprises a base of composition selected 

such that the base bandgap narrows from emitter towards collector in substantially 
step-wise fashion, resulting in N (N≧2) substantially flat levels in the base bandgap. 

The height Δ
j
 of the steps in the bandgap is greater than kT 
(typically at least about 30 meV), 

and also greater than the threshold energy of an appropriate rapid inelastic 
minority carrier scattering mechanism (e.g., optical phonon scattering, plasmon 

scattering) in the base material.

<DESCRIPTION>
This application pertains to a method of using heterojunction bipolar transistors (HBTs).Since the invention of the transistor in 1947, much effort has been
directed towards extension of the device operating range towards higher and higher
frequencies.Conventionally, the cut-off frequency fT (defined as the frequency at
which the current gain β, i.e., the absolute value of the parameter hfe ≡∂JC/∂JB, is
unity) is used as a figure of merit that is indicative of the high frequency capability
of a transistor. See for instance, S. M. Sze, "Physics of Semiconductor Devices",
2nd Edition, John Wiley & Sons, 1981, Chapter 3. It is well known that β at high
frequencies decreases at a rate of 10 dB/decade, i.e. proportionally to inverse
frequency.Another parameter that can be used to characterize the high frequency
capabilities of a (typically microwave) transistor is the unilateral (power) gain U.
See S. M. Sze, op. cit., pp. 160-165. It is well known that U at high frequencies
decreases at the rate of 20 dB/decade, i.e., proportionally to the inverse square of the
frequency. The frequency at which the unilateral gain is unity is the maximum
oscillating frequency fmax, which can, but need not, be larger than fT. Both fT and
fmax are conventionally determined by extrapolation of the measured roll-off
in h fe
and U, respectively. Although HBTs having fT substantially above 100 GHz have
recently been reported (see, for instance, Y. K. Chen, et al. IEEEElectronDev.
Lett., Vol. 10, No. 6, p. 267, 1989), it would clearly be highly desirable to have
available transistors that can, inter alia, operate at even higher frequencies.G. T. Wright, (see, for instance, SolidStateElectronics, Vol. 22, p. 399,
1979) proposed extension of active transistor operation to frequencies beyond the
conventional cutoff frequencies. The proposal involved the utilization of transit time
resonances that arise from carrier drift in the collector space charge region, resulting
in a negative output resistance of the transistor. The proposed model suggested for
an ideal transistor (i.e., a transistor without any parasitic extrinsic impedances) the
possibility that I U I could exceed unity at frequencies above fmax. However, it has
now been shown (S. Tiwari, IEEEElectronDeviceLetter, Vol. 10, No. 12, p. 574,
1989) that the proposed utilization of the collector transit time resonances in a
conventional GaAs/AlGaAs HBT would require reductions of each of the base and 
collector resistances and of the collector capacitance by at least an order of
