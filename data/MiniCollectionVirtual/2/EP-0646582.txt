<ABSTRACT>
The hemi-hydrate form of the cerebral function 
enhancing agent 1-[[1-[2-(trifluoromethyl)-4-pyrimidinyl]
-4-piperidinyl]-methyl-2-pyrrolidinone, 

or 
BMY-21502 as it is more commonly designated, is an 

improved form of drug substance having equivalent 
biopharmaceutical properties compared to the known 

anhydrous form but providing cost, safety and 
ecological advantages in manufacture over the known 

anhydrous form.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention generally pertains to heterocyclic 
compounds having drug and bio-affecting properties and 
to their preparation and use. In particular, the 
invention is concerned with the hemi-hydrate form of a 
cognition enhancing agent, 1-[[1-[2-(trifluoromethyl)-4-pyrimidinyl]-4-piperidinyl]-methyl]-2-pyrrolidinone. 
This agent is more commonly known as BMY-21502, 
although it is also designated BMS 181168. BMY-21502 is an orally active agent for the 
treatment of memory and cognitive disorders including 
senile dementia and Alzheimer's disease. While its 
mechanism of action is not completely known, 
beneficial effects of BMY-21502 have been demonstrated 
in behavorial paradigms, autoradiographic studies, 
cell culture studies and electrophysiologic 
examination of hippocampal neurons in rat brain 
slices. The hemi-hydrate form of BMY-21502, the compound 
of this invention is likewise a cerebral function 
enhancer useful in treating various dementias due to 
degenerative processes as well as in enhancing memory 
and learning. The most relevant art is believed to be the 
patent to Mattson, et al., U.S. Pat. No. 4,826,843 
issued May 2, 1989, wherein compounds of general 
formula (1) were disclosed as having cognition and 
memory enhancing activities.     For formula (1), X is an ethylene chain or 1,2-benzo 
ring; Y is carbonyl or methylene; R¹ is hydrogen 
or lower alkyl; and Z is an R², R³-disubstituted 
diazinyl ring selected from pyridazine, pyrimidine, 
and pyrazine ring systems. A preferred compound of 
the series was 1-[[1[2-(trifluoromethyl)-4-pyrimidinyl]-4-piperidinyl]-methyl]-2-pyrrolidinone 
(1a), hereinafter referred as BMY-21502. 
   BMY-21502 has been under clinical evaluation for 
the treatment of memory and cognitive disorders. Other related art comprises oxygenated 
derivatives of BMY-21502 disclosed in U.S. 5,098,904 
issued March 24, 1992 to Mattson, et al. and an 
improved synthetic process for producing BMY-21502 
which was disclosed in U.S. 4,963,678 issued October 
16, 1990 to Mattson, et al. Although solvates such as hydrates were disclosed 
in general terms for formula (1) compounds by Mattson, 
et al. in U.S. 4,826,843, there has been no prior 
disclosure or appreciation of the useful novel hemi-hydrate  
 
form of BMY-21502 which constitutes the 
present invention. A major advantage of the hemi-hydrate 
form of BMY-21502 relates to increased 
efficiency and safety in manufacture of the hemi-hydrate 
compound over the anhydrous form which was 
specifically disclosed in the
