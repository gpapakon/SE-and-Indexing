<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to monitoring circuits for batteries, 
whereby the operation of the battery may be monitored during charge or discharge. 
The monitoring of batteries during charge or discharge determines whether any 
module or cell of the battery has become faulty, and is especially important in 
respect of large batteries that may have very high voltage and/or current and/or 
ampere-hour ratings. The monitoring circuit of the present invention is applicable 
to batteries which comprise a series of cells or, in the usual case, modules, which 
are configured in such a manner that the voltage across any one module can be 
determined at any time under the conditions described hereafter. There are many circumstances where large batteries may be found. In 
particular, large batteries or battery installations can be found both in stationary 
applications or for traction purposes, such as in standby DC power installations 
from which invertors and the like may be run; or in traction devices such as fork 
lift trucks and pallet trucks, golf carts, and electrically powered passenger and 
cargo vehicles. Large batteries may be configured from a plurality of cells or 
modules, which may be connected in series so as to develop a substantial terminal 
voltage across the battery, and there may often be a parallel connection of other 
modules or a series configuration of parallel connected cells or modules. United States Patent 4,217,645, issued to BARRY et al, describes a 
monitoring circuit for a battery that has a series of modules or cells connected in 
series, with means being provided to monitor the voltage across each module, as 
well as means for selectively sampling each of those modules. There is a 
transponder which responds to digital commands such that an analog signal from  
 
a selccted sensor is coupled to a voltage controlled oscillator, whose output is 
coupled for a specific time period to a scanner/display means. If any specific 
parameter of any cell or module which is being sampled and monitored exceeds 
specified limits, an alarm may be provided. The present invention is particularly directed to large batteries which are 
configured in a series configuration of individual cells or modules. It is the 
purpose of the present invention to provide means for monitoring the condition and 
performance of the thus configured batteries, and particularly when such batteries 
may be utilized in electric vehicles. Typical battery configurations of experimental 
electric vehicles currently found in

<CLAIMS>
A monitoring circuit for a battery (12;66) while said battery is being 
charged or discharged, where said battery comprises a series of modules 

connected in series, and where a terminal is placed between each adjacent pair of 
modules and at each end of said battery, so that the voltage across each module 

may be measured at the pair of terminals defining the module, said monitoring 
circuit being 
characterized by
: 

means for periodically interrupting the flow of current to or 
from said battery for an interruption interval of fewer than about 2 to 10 ms; 
means (30;70) for selectively sampling the voltage of any one of said 
modules, during an interruption of current flow, so as to make a determination of 

the resistance free voltage of that module; 
means (40,42;72,74;138,140) for comparing said resistance free 
voltage of the module against at least two reference voltages (32,34;62,64), to 

determine if said resistance free voltage is above a first predetermined level or 
below a second predetermined level which is lower than said first predetermined level; and 
means (54;56;132,152) for causing an alarm indication in the event 
that said resistance free voltage is found to be either above said first predetermined 

level or below said second predetermined level. 
The monitoring circuit of claim 1, further comprising a time division 
multiplexer (28;70) connected to said terminals, wherein sampling of the voltage 

of each of said modules is done seriatim by said time division multiplexer means, 
whereby at least some of said modules are sampled as to their resistance free 

voltage during any one interruption interval. 
The monitoring circuit of claim 2, wherein a single difference 
amplifier (30;72) having two inputs is utilized together with said time division 

multiplexer to determine the voltage across the inputs of said single difference 
amplifier as they are connected across the terminals of any one module by the 

operation of said time division multiplexer.  
 
The monitoring circuit of claim 1, wherein sampling of the voltage 
of each of said modules is done by a dedicated amplifier assigned to each said 

module, and including means for selectively choosing any one of said dedicated 
amplifiers seriatim, whereby at least some of said modules are sampled as to their 

resistance free voltage during any one interruption interval. 
The monitoring circuit of claim 1, further comprising means for 
sampling the voltage across any one of said modules while current is flowing 

through said module; 

sample and hold means (78,80) for determining and temporarily 
holding the values of a first voltage across the module being sampled when current 

is flowing through said module, and of a second resistance free voltage across the 
module during an interruption interval of current through said module; 
means (138,140) for determining the difference between said first and 
second voltages during charge and discharge conditions, and for determining if the 

difference between said first and second voltages during charging and discharging 
operations of said battery exceeds a predetermined value; and 
means (132,152) for causing an alarm indication in the event that 
either of said first and second voltages is above or below predetermined values, or 

in the event that the difference between said first and second voltages exceeds said 
predetermined value. 
The monitoring circuit of claim 1, wherein means are provided for 
monitoring a selected plurality of modules during any single interruption interval. 
The monitoring circuit of claim 1, where only two reference voltages 
are referred to, and each of said two reference voltages is a function of a control 

reference voltage which is determined as a function of the battery voltage during 
a charging operation of said battery so as to thereby control the value of charging 

current delivered to said battery.
