<ABSTRACT>
A piezoceramic capsule for telephone instruments, of the type 
comprising a terminal-holder spool, a piezoceramic diaphragm 

in pressure contact with nail-shaped feed-through terminals 
forced in the spool, an elastic O-ring for producing the 

contact pressure and a perforated case housing them, is 
modified to transform the case into a cover-up disc and the 

spool into a case being provided with a stepped cylindric 
cavity designed to house, from the bottom to the top, 

respectively the diaphragm, the elastic O-ring and the cover-up 
disc. 
A plurality of resilient pawls are formed by pressing 
inside respective cuts provided in the sidewall of the 

opening of said cylindric cavity and designed to snap on said 
cover-up disc in a closure position.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a piezoceramic capsule
for use in telephone instruments, of the type including a
bottom base in the form of a terminal-holder spool, a
piezoceramic diaphragm having a face covered by a circular ceramic layer (12), and being pressed in contact with at least two nail-shaped
terminals forced into the spool in axial direction, an
elastic O-ring for generating the necessary contact pressure
and a perforated case, whose openings allow the transmission
of acoustic waves generated by the vibrations of the
diaphragm disposed in such a way as to maintain said elastic
O-ring in contact with said diaphragm.Such a capsule is disclosed e.g. in the Italian patent
application for Utility Model No. 21175-B/90 filed by the
Applicant.Therein the case made from insulating material acts as a
container for the other members and it is provided on its
perforated wall with an annular housing extending coaxially
thereto, with a reference tooth designed to engage in a
corresponding notch provided on the spool to assure the
correct positioning of the latter during the assembly of the
capsule, and with an annular extension designed to snap on the
external face of the spool and secure it.This type of capsule as disclosed in the above-mentioned
application, when positioned in the corresponding seat of the 
handset requires a further gasket for seal.In an advantageous embodiment also described and
illustrated in the above-mentioned application, the case is
formed directly on the bottom of the handset housing by
pressing. In this circumstance the additional gasket is no
longer necessary, but the automation of the capsule assembly
is affected since the relative operations are tied to the
type of the handset.An object of the present invention is to provide a
piezoceramic capsule of the type mentioned at the outset
which is so conceived as to be free from the type of handset,
to simplify the automation of the assembly operations and to
avoid the use of an additional gasket when mounting the
capsule into the handset.Another object of the present invention is to provide a
piezoceramic capsule of the type mentioned above which allows
cost reduction.The above-mentioned objects are obtained in accordance
with the present invention by a piezoceramic capsule for
telephone instruments which is characterized in that the case
is substantially shaped like a cover-up disc and said spool
is adapted to house, in a cylindric cavity hollowed out in
its end face adjacent to said diaphragm, respectively from
the bottom to

Piezoceramic capsule (21) for telephone instruments of the
type including:


a bottom base (4) in the form of a terminal-holder spool;
a piezoceramic diaphragm (3) having a face covered by a circular ceramic layer (12), and being pressed in contact with at
least two nail-shaped terminals (5,6) forced into the spool (4)

in axial direction;
an elastic O-ring (2) for generating the necessary contact
pressure;
a perforated case (1) whose openings allow the transmission
of acoustic waves generated by the vibrations of the

diaphragm (3) disposed in such a way as to maintain said elastic
O-ring (2) in contact with said diaphragm (3);

said capsule being characterized in that:

said case (1) is substantially formed as a cover-up disc,
and
said spool (4) is adapted to house, in a cylindrical cavity
hollowed out in its end face adjacent to said diaphragm

(3), respectively from the bottom to the top, said
diaphragm (3), said O-ring (2) and said cover-up disc (1) and

to hold the same assembled with a slight pre-loading on
the O-ring (2).
Piezoceramic capsule (21) acording to claim 1, characterized in
that said cylindrical cavity is stepped and formed by

three sections (S1, S2, S3) with diameter increasing from
the bottom to the top, said sections forming two steps (9,17),

the first one (9) at the interface between the innermost section
with the smallest diameter (S1) and the intermediate section (S2), serves to receive in abutment said diaphragm (3) and

the second step (17) at the interface between the intermediate
section (S2) and the outer one (S3) being located approximately at

the middle of the cross section of said O-ring (2).
Piezoceramic capsule (21) according to claim 2, characterized
in that said innermost section (S1) of said stepped cavity has

a diameter comprised between the diameter of said 
diaphragm (3) and the diameter of said circular ceramic

layer (12).
Piezoceramic capsule (21) according to claim 1, characterized
in that said cover-up disc (1) has its outer edge provided

with a chamfer (20) converging towards the inside of the
capsule (21).
Piezoceramic capsule (21) according to any of claims 1 and 2, characterized
in that the portion of spool (4) comprised between

its outer perimeter and the inner wall of said intermediate
cavity section is broken by a plurality of radial cuts

(13A) axially extending beyond the bottom of said innermost cavity section (S1), said cuts (13A) housing respective resilient pawls (13),
elastically movable in a radial direction and designed to

snap on the outer surface of said cover-up disc (1) and
hold it in a closure position when the capsule (21) is assembled.
Piezoceramic capsule (21) according to claim 5, characterized

in that each of said resilient pawls (13) is lamellar,
axially extending towards the bottom of the respective cut

(13A), with a first end rigidly fixed to the body of the
spool (4) and the second end bent, and converging towards

the inside of said outer cavity section (S3) so as to form an
abutment step (19) designed to snap on said cover-up disc

(1) in such a way as to hold it with said slight pre-loading
on said O-ring (2).
Piezoceramic capsule (21) according to any of the preceding claims,
characterized in that said bent end of said pawls (13) has

a chamfer (18) converging toward the inside of said cavity
designed to make easier the introduction into the latter

of said cover-up disc (1) during the assemby of the capsule
(21).
Piezoceramic capsule (21) according to claim 6, characterized
in that said resilient pawls (13) are obtained during the

forming of the spool (4) by pressing.
Piezoceramic capsule (21) according to claim 8, characterized
in that said resillient pawls (13) are 90 degrees spaced

out from each other.
