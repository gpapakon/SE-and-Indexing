<ABSTRACT>
Drag-chain replacement for a flexible line arrangement in the form of a line-receiving duct for connecting two devices between which there is a capacity for relative movement. The drag-chain replacement comprises a flexible line-receiving duct (31) which exhibits, between a base region (27) and a top region, a duct interior (35) for receiving at least one flexible line (37, 39), in particular in the form of an electric line or of an electric cable. The line-receiving duct (31) is made up, according to the invention, using a flexible, permanently deformable, flat material. The top region of the line-receiving duct (31) is formed by a multiplicity of flat-material straps (15, 17) which follow one after the other in the longitudinal direction of the duct, project laterally from the base region (27) and are bent permanently at a distance above the base region (27).
