<ABSTRACT>
A halftone dot area percentage is determined under 
desired output conditions as to a recording medium, an exposure 

condition, a printing condition, a screen ruling, a 
screen angle, and the like. Continuous tone correction data 

are generated from the halftone dot area percentage, and 
stored in a continuous tone correction data memory. A 

halftone dot corrector corrects desired continuous tone 
image data based on the continuous tone correction data. 

Then, the corrected continuous tone image data are converted 
into halftone 

dot image data by halftone dot image data binary processor. 
A high-quality halftone dot image free of tone jump is 

generated from the halftone dot image data.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method of correcting
halftone dot image data in order to prevent tone
jump from occurring in a halftone dot image which is
generated under desired output conditions from the halftone
dot image data that are converted from continuous tone image
data, and an image processing apparatus capable of
correcting such halftone dot image data. In particular, the invention relates to an image processing apparatus for converting
continuous tone image data into halftone dot image data and generating
a halftone dot image from the halftone dot image data, comprising: continuous
tone correction data memory means for storing continuous tone correction
data; continuous tone image data correcting means for correcting
continuous tone image data based on the continuous tone correction data;
and converting means for converting the corrected continuous tone image
data into halftone dot image data.Further, the invention also relates to an image processing apparatus for converting
continuous tone image data into halftone dot image data and generating
a halftone dot image from the halftone dot image data, comprising
threshold data memory means for storing threshold data being corrected in
dependence on given output conditions; and converting means for converting
continuous tone image data into halftone dot image data based on the
threshold data.Such apparatus, as well as corresponding methods for converting continuous
tone image data into halftone dot image data are disclosed in EP-A-0 334
518. In the field of printing and platemaking, there
have been employed image reading and recording apparatus for
electrically processing image information of a color
original and making a film with a view to increasing the
efficiency of processing steps and improving the quality of
images. In such image reading and recording apparatus, more
specifically, the image information recorded on the original
is photoelectrically read and converted into image data,
which are subjected to various forms of image processing
such as sharpness enhancement, tone adjustment, color
correction, and the like. Thereafter, a laser beam
modulated by the processed image data is scanned over a film
to make an original film.The image on an original film thus produced is 
recorded on a printed material normally by reversing the
negative film into a positive film, producing a press plate
from the positive film, and printing the image with the
press plate.A continuous tone image such as a photographic
image is usually outputted onto a
