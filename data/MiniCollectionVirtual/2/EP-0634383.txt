<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a process for the addition of HF onto halogenated alkenes (for subjecting HF to an addition reaction with halogenated alkenes) by reacting these halogenated alkenes with at least one hydrogen fluoride of the general formula [B.n HF] in which B is an organic nitrogen base and n is an integer or a fraction 
<
/= 4, the reaction of perfluoroisobutene CF2 = C-(CF3)2 being excluded.
