<DESCRIPTION>
This invention is concerned with a method for producing high purity 
methacrylic acid esters in high yield. A number of commercial processes are 
practiced for the production of such esters including sulfuric acid treatment of 
acetone cyanohydrin, two stage oxidation of isobutylene or t-butyl alcohol, and 
liquid phase catalytic condensation of propionaldehyde with formaldehyde. A typical commercial cyanohydrin process is described in US-A-4,529,816 
("816") for the production of methyl methacrylate ("MMA"). In this process, 
acetone cyanohydrin ("ACH") is (1) hydrolyzed by sulfuric acid to produce α-hydroxyisobutyramide 
("HIBAM") and its sulfate ester, α-sulfatoisobutyramide 
("SIBAM"); (2) the HIBAM and SIBAM are thermally converted to 2-methacrylamide 
("MAM") and a small amount of methacrylic acid ("MAA"); which 
is then (3) esterified with methanol to produce MMA (residual HIBAM is esterified 
to methyl α-hydroxyisobutyrate ("MOB")). Also disclosed in '816 is an 
improvement to the general process for producing MMA wherein the MOB present 
is isolated and returned to the process between the thermal conversion and 
esterification steps. The thermal conversion step in '816 is conducted at a sufficiently high 
temperature and for a sufficiently long time to maximize MAM formation from 
HIBAM and SIBAM prior to esterification. The thermal conversion of SIBAM is 
more facile than the thermal conversion of HIBAM. One objective of '816 is to 
obtain the maximum yield of MAM and MAA at this step. MAA is a co-product of 
the thermal conversion step and is also converted to MMA during esterification. In 
addition, '816 specifies that care must be taken when returning isolated MOB into 
the process between the thermal conversion and esterification steps such that the  
 
sulfuric acid strength is maintained at about 97 - 100% and the mole ratio of free 
sulfuric acid to MOB is maintained between 4 and 40. EP-A-0 407 811 discloses an acetone cyanohydrin process that does not require 
sulfuric acid for preparing methacrylic acid esters. A key step of this process is the 
vapor phase dehydration/dealcoholization of α-hydroxy-, α-alkoxy, or β-alkoxy 
carboxylic acid esters in the presence of an alkali metal and platinum group element 
modified crystalline aluminosilicate disclosed in EP-A-0 429 800. However, this 
process suffers from low yields based on ACH. Even with the improved process described in '816, there is still a need for a 
high purity, high yield MMA process. Part of the driving force for
