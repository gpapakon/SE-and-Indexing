<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a reserve ISFET, especially for use in fluidic ISFET measurement systems. In particular, the present invention relates to means of passivation and activation of the ISFET function, which make it possible to switch on individual ISFETs from an array, serially as required in the measurement cycle, and thereby to give the measurement system a lifetime which matches the problem. According to the invention, a reserve ISFET has, in addition to the chemically sensitive gate film (membrane) (5), a sacrificial layer (6) which covers the gate, stops direct contact of the chemically sensitive film with the measurement medium and thereby prevents the degradation process of the ISFET. The sacrificial layer consists, for example, of metal (Al, Cr, Ni, Au) or of a photosensitive polymer. The ISFET function is activated by deliberate removal of the sacrificial layer using electrochemical or optochemical dissolving. An array of this kind of reserve ISFETs allows a continuous fluidic measurement system to be given a freely selectable lifetime.

<CLAIMS>
Redundancy ISFET, preferably for use in fluidics ISFET
measuring systems, characterised in that the chemically-sensitive

gate isolator is coated with an additional, selectively
removable, sacrificial layer, resistant to the

medium being measured and which prevents contact of the
membrane with the medium being measured and that the ISFET

has means to enable an externally-controllable removal of
the sacrificial layer.
Redundancy ISFET in accordance with Claim 1, characterised
in that the sacrificial layer is a metal, a polymer or a

combination of metal and polymer.
Redundancy ISFET in accordance with Claim 1, characterised
in that the means for removing the sacrificial layer is

electrochemical or optochemical in nature.
Redundancy ISFET in accordance with Claim 1, characterised
in that the sacrificial layer coating the gate isolator

extends in area over the chemically-sensitive region and
is used there as a transition or connecting layer between

sensor element and continuous flow cell.
