<ABSTRACT>
The present invention provides a current limiting short-circuiting protector which utilizes an electronic and thermal feedback principle for achieving precise and rapid release of the protector, which can be readily reset. The principle utilizes a non-linear powerful temperature-dependent resistor (R5) in the collector circuit of a field effect transistor (M1) which serves as a current valve and through which the total current to be monitored is passed. The circuit replaces a conventional fuse and may also function as a load on/off control means. When a fault occurs in the load, the erroneous current is limited to a much lower value than is the case with a conventional fuse.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a shortcircuit limiting
protector, and more specifically to an electronic
fuse which has minimal power losses under normal
operating conditions and which will be triggered
rapidly and reliably at a predetermined current level.There is found in different electronic circuits and
units for supplying working voltages to such circuits
a need for safety devices in the form of fuses which
will trigger when the current in the circuit protected
by the fuse becomes excessively high, for instance due
to a short-circuit.The most common type of fuse is the thermal fuse which
normally consists of a glass tube which contains a
thin filament or wire which melts or burns when a
given current passes through the filament, because the
product of filament resistance and current generates
heat which, when the current is excessive, melts the
filament.A fuse of this kind will operate satisfactorily in the
event of a complete short-circuit, whereupon the fuse
is triggered relatively quickly. In the event of a
short-circuit, the fuse permits a high short-circuit
current to pass through, which short-circuit current
is limited solely by the impedance of the supply
source. Such high short-circuit currents are liable to
damage conductors, electric contacts and other electronic
devices, and may disturb parallel-supplied
electronic devices. On the other hand, if the current
is high and lies close to or immediately above the
rated value of the fuse, it may take considerable time 
for the fuse to trigger, which in some cases can cause
considerable problems due to the overloading of other
circuit components. Furthermore, a fuse of this kind
can be made either slow or quick. Furthermore, when
subjected to loads that are close to its rated value,
a fuse of this kind may undergo changes caused by
aging, such that after a longer installation period
the fuse may trigger without the original rated value
of the fuse being exceeded.Up-to-date voltage supply units often have some form
of current limitation which permits maximum power to
be taken-out by a circuit. This is often achieved by
allowing the current to reach a given maximum value
and then reducing the voltage so that the current will
never exceed the current limiting value. When the
voltage is reduced, this may render the operation of
many circuits unsafe because a voltage level becomes
critical, which may jeopardize the application as a
whole.In order to overcome this drawback, it is necessary to
monitor voltage in addition to monitoring current, so
that

<CLAIMS>
An electronic short-circuit current limiter having
minimum power losses at nominal currents and including

in the current path a MOS field effect transistor (M1)
and a temperature-dependent resistor (R5), wherein the

MOS field effect transistor (Ml) is controlled by a
detection circuit which detects the occurrence of a

short-circuit current, 
characterized in
 that the
current limiter is arranged such that:


the temperature of the temperature-dependent
resistor (R5) is also influenced by thermal energy

emitted by the MOS field effect transistor (M1);
the temperature-dependent resistor (R5) is connected
electrically in series to the MOS field effect

transistor (M1), wherein the current to be monitored
passes through the series connection of the MOS field

effect transistor (M1) and the temperature-dependent
resistor (R5);
the gate of the MOS field effect transistor (M1)
is maintained at a high level with the aid of a resistor

(R4) and a zener diode (Z1) in normal operating
conditions, so that the MOS field effect transistor

(M1) is fully conducting in normal operating conditions;

(R3, R8) is connected across the series connection of

the MOS field effect transistor (M1) and the temperature-dependent
resistor (R5);
a second transistor (Q1) has its base connected to
the junction of said two resistors (R3, R8), the

second transistor (Q1) being connected in parallel
with the zener diode (Z1) which is thereby shortcircuited

by the second transistor (Q1) when said
second transistor (Q1) conducts current as a result of

the potential on its base electrode exceeding a threshold
value; and
the current limiter has two stable states, a first
state in which the second transistor (Q1) is essentially 

non-conducting and the MOS field effect transistor

stationary state within a linear working range of the

field effect transistor (M1).

characterized
in
 that the temperature-dependent resistor
(R5) has a pronounced non-linear characteristic,

wherein the voltage drop over the temperature-dependent
resistor (R5) increases rapidly with increasing

current, so that the voltage over the voltage divider
(R3, R8) increases rapidly and the second transistor

(Q1) begins rapidly to conduct current, therewith
causing the MOS field effect transistor (M1) to switch

rapidly to its non-conducting state.
The current limiter according to Claim 2, 
characterized
in
 that a capacitor (C1) is connected to the
base electrode of the second transistor (Q1) so as to

provide a determined time constant before the second
transistor (Q1) begins to conduct current in response

to a voltage increase over the second voltage divider
(R3, R8), whereby tripping of the MOS field effect

transistor (M1) is delayed by a time period corresponding
to the RC-product of the time delay arrangement

on the base electrode of the second transistor

R8); in that the output of the further voltage divider

(R10, R11) together with a further capacitor (C3) is 
connected to the base electrode of the further transistor

(Q2) in order to automatically reset the current
limiter after a time lapse determined by the RC-product

of the further voltage divider (R10, R11) and
the further capacitor (C3).
The current limiter according to any one of the
preceding Claims, 
characterized in
 that the current
limiter includes a single-pole switch (SW1) having

three switch positions, wherein the base electrode of
the second transistor (Q1) can be temporarily connected

to the emitter electrode of the second transistor
(Q1) via a first switch position so as to reset the

current limiter, the base electrode of the second
transistor (Q1) can be connected to a voltage supply

via a second switch position and via a resistor (R2)
so as to maintain the second transistor (Q1) continuously

in a conducting state and the current limiter in
its non-conducting state; and in that the switch has a

neutral position between the first and the second
switch positions.
