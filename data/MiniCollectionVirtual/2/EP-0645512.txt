<ABSTRACT>
A securing device (6) for cupboards (1) or the like 
with several superimposed drawers (3) which may be pulled 

out horizontally, having a vertically extending movable 
locking element co-operating with catch members (S) 

controlled by the drawers (3) such that, after a drawer has 
been pulled out, the locking element enters a blocking 

position in which the pulling out of a further drawer is 
prevented, in which the locking element is designed as an 

outwardly bendable line (7) and the catching operation is 
achieved by bulging (B) of the line (7) by means of one of 

the catch member (5) into a taut position. This results in 
a securing device of increased utility, whilst being less 

complicated in construction and installation than known 
designs.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a securing device for 
cupboards or the like with several superimposed drawers 
which may be pulled out horizontally, which securing device 
has a vertically extending movable locking element 
co-operating with catch members controlled by the drawers 
such that, after a drawer has been pulled out, the locking 
element enters a blocking position in which the pulling out 
of a further drawer is prevented. Such securing devices embody a so-called tilting catch. 
This tilting catch prevents all drawers from being pulled 
out and therefore prevents excess weight from being produced 
in front of the cupboard body. Therefore the cupboard cannot 
tip over forwardly, particularly when the drawers are full. DE-PS 20 44 365 proposes that the locking element be 
produced in the form of a vertically movable locking rod 
having blocking pegs which co-operate with a link block 
resting on the drawer. When a drawer is pulled, the 
blocking pegs place themselves in a catching manner in front 
of the link blocks of the other drawers. According to a 
further proposal, the locking element is formed by push 
elements lined up in the manner of strings of pearls 
(Ronis). The joint between the push elements which are the 
same lengths as one another allows a catch member to enter 
an escape space thus formed, which catch member displaces 
the push elements such that the catch members of the other 
drawers do not find the appropriate escape space, which 
holds the other catch members in the intended securing 
position. However, this securing device demands precision  
 
which can only be produced with extreme effort. An object of the present invention is to design a 
generic securing device which is simple to produce but is 
reliable. This object is achieved by the invention described in 
Claim 1. The other claims provide preferred designs. A design of this type results in a generic securing 
device with increased usefulness, the design at the same 
time being simplified in terms of construction and 
installation. In concrete terms, the locking element is 
designed as an outwardly bendable line and the catching 
operation is achieved by bulging of the line by means of one 
of the catch members into the taut position. During the 
bulging operation, the restricted supply for movement of the 
locking element is used up. The taut position has a 
catching effect on the other drawers. It is understandable 
that a locking element of this type does not require 
precision exceeding the normal amount with

<CLAIMS>
A securing device (6) for cupboards (1) or the like 
with several superimposed drawers (3) which may be pulled 

out horizontally, which securing device (6) has a vertically 
extending movable locking element co-operating with catch 

members (S) controlled by the drawers (3) such that, after a 
drawer (3) has been pulled out, the locking element enters a 

blocking position in which the pulling out of a further 
drawer (3) is prevented, characterised in that the locking 

element is designed as an outwardly bendable line (7) and 

the catching operation is achieved by bulging (B) of the 
line (7) by means of one of the catch members (S) into a 

taut position. 
A securing device according to claim 1, characterised 
in that the line (7) is designed as a link chain (8) which 

is fixed at both ends. 
A securing device according to any preceding claim, 
characterised in that one fastening end (7') is arranged so 

as to be vertically movable by a lock cylinder (10) 
determining the taut position. 
A securing device according to any preceding claim, 
characterised in that the locking members (S) are designed 

as pivot levers (13) which are controlled by pegs (15) of 
the drawer (3) and are designed with two arms such that one 

arm (a) is controlled by the drawer and the other arm (b) 
causes the line (7) to bulge (bulge B). 
A securing device according to any preceding claim, 
characterised in that the arm (b) causing the line (7) to 

 
bulge acts on the line (7) by means of an intermediate 

element mounted with clearance. 
A securing device according to any preceding claim, 
characterised in that the intermediate element is supported 

in the beyond-dead-centre position (T-T) in a bay (20) in 
the other arm (b) in the catching position. 
A securing device according to any preceding claim, 
characterised in that the intermediate element is designed 

as a ring (19) which rests with clearance on a pin (21) 
extending adjacently to the journal (14) of the catch member 

(S). 
A securing device according to any preceding claim, 
characterised in that the drawer-controlled arm (a) is 

fork-shaped in design and the peg (15) of the drawer (3) 
travels out of the fork opening (17) and into the fork 

opening. 
A securing device according to any preceding claim, 
characterised by supporting portions (24) located on both 

sides of the bulge (B). 
A securing device according to one or more of the 
preceding claim, characterised in that the catch member (S) 

passes between the narrow sides of the link plates (25) and 
the diameter of the ring (19) substantially corresponds to 

the length of one link plate (25). 
A securing device according to any preceding claim, 
 

characterised in that the supporting portions (24) are 
designed as a strip passing between the link plate (25). 
A securing device according to any preceding claim, 
characterised in that the line (7) is designed as a cable 

(9) fixed at both ends and the ring (19) is designed as a 
marginally grooved annular disc.
