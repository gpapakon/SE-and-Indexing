<ABSTRACT>
A disk player has a magazine for storing disks and a disk transport 
mechanism transporting a selected disk between four positions including an 

ejection position, a load position, a playback position, and an initial store 
position which lie in a single plane. The selected disk is carried upon a tray 

from the ejection position to the load position where the selected disk is 
partially removed from the tray to the playback position above a disk reader. 

The partial removal of the disk from the tray to the load position provides a 
required clearance for the disk reader permitting a tray length to be minimized. 

The magazine accepts a plurality of disks. An alignment mechanism provides 
relative movement between the magazine and a plane of transport of the disk 

transport mechanism permitting a selected disk to be inserted or removed from 
the magazine at the initial store position. The disk reader is positioned to read 

the selected disk overlapping disks stored in the magazine resulting in a 
smaller disk player size. An embodiment of the invention transports the disks 

upon carriages accepted in the magazine and a lifter mechanism pivots apart 
disks in the magazine to allow sufficient clearance for the reading of a selected 

disk.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an optical disk player having a
magazine for storing disks which permits the playing of selected disks from the
magazine, and more particularly, to a disk player having a disk reader for
reading selected disks which are partially withdrawn from the magazine
thereby permitting a compact construction. A similar disk player is
disclosed in co-pending European Patent Application
No. 94 103 344.1.Disk players having magazines for storing disks typically provide a
selecting apparatus for transporting a selected disk from the magazine and
to a disk reader or an ejection position. This type of disk player is referred
to herein as a changer-type player because of its ability to exchange disks
between a reader and a magazine.Various types of this kind of changer-type player have been proposed
and marketed. An example of such a disk player is disclosed is U.S. Patent
No. 5,123,001. The disclosed disk player provides carriages for holding disks
which are transported between ejection, playback, and storage positions,
wherein the storage position locates a selected disk positioned within the
magazine. The disks are arranged concentrically within the magazine and the
magazine moves in a first direction perpendicular to the recorded surfaces of
the disks. Disks are transported in a straight line in a second direction,
perpendicular to the first direction, by a disk transport mechanism. Disks in
the playback position are completely removed from the magazine by the disk
transport mechanism for the purpose of playing. Disks accepted at the ejection
position are transported on a carriage held by a moving tray to the playback
position where the disks are lifted from the tray and played. The above design provides for efficiency in operation and offers the
advantage of playing a selected disk or a sequence of disks from the magazine
without manually handling. However, the locating of the eject, playback, and
storage positions in a single plane requires a larger depth dimension then is
desirable and interferes with producing a compact design. One alternative is
to position the magazine to the side of the playback position instead of in-line
with the playback position. This alternative however does not permit efficient
design of the transport mechanism because transport from the magazine to the
playback position is in a different direction than transport from the playback
to the ejection position thereby requiring redundant mechanisms which increase
the cost of production. Therefore, other

A disk player comprising

a housing (82, 84, 10, 10', 30);
a magazine (50) having a plurality of holding means (58, 59) for concentrically
holding a plurality of disks (201) having recording surfaces;
a disk reader (200);
said magazine (50) disposed within said housing (82, 84, 10, 10', 30);
means for transporting a disk between an access position, external to
said device, said disk reader (200) and said magazine (50);
means for aligning a selected one of said plurality of disks (201) with said
means for transporting;
said means for transporting including means for transporting said disk in
a direction substantially parallel to a recording surface of said disk between said

magazine (50) and said disk reader (200);
said means for aligning includes means for moving said magazine (50)
in a direction perpendicular to said recording surfaces of said recording surfaces

of said plurality of disks (201) and to a direction of transport of said
means for transporting, such that said selected disk is aligned with said means

for transporting while said means for transporting remains fixed;
said means for transporting includes a plurality of carriages (58, 59);
said means for transporting includes a tray (20) containing a selected
carriage which supports said selected disk;
said magazine (50) accepts carriages in said holding means such that
each of said holding means receives one of said plurality of carriages;

   
characterized by:
means for separating (43)said carriages (58, 59) to permit said disk
reader (200) to read said selected disk while said selected disk overlaps others

of said disks (201) within said magazine (50); and 
said separating means includes means for lifting an adjacent carriage located
in said magazine (50) above said selected carriage.
The disk player according to claim 1, further comprising:

a plurality of prongs (51) in said magazine (50);
each of said plurality of carriages (58,59) fitted between adjacent pairs of
said prongs (51);
said adjacent pairs being spaced to limit movement of a respective carriage;
and
said means for separating being effective to separate a portion of an
adjacent carriage adjacent to said selected carriage associated with said selected

disk remote from said adjacent pair of prongs, whereby said adjacent
carriage is pivoted about said adjacent pair of prongs.
The disk player according to claim 1 wherein said separator means
displaces apart disks in said magazine (50) to permit reading of said selected

disk.
The disk player according to claim 1, wherein each of said plurality of
carriages (58, 59) has a clearance notch (165) for receiving a corresponding

one of said plurality of prongs (51).
The disk player according to claim 4, wherein:

each of said plurality of prongs (51) has a narrow tip relative to a base of
each of said plurality of prongs (51); and 
said clearance notches (165) and prongs (51) being shaped to permit
said plurality of prongs to fit at least partially within corresponding ones of said

each of said clearance notches such that adjacent ones of said plurality of carriages
(58, 59) are substantially in contact from a forward edge of adjacent

ones to a rear edge of said adjacent ones.
