 DESCRIPTIONCARBOSTYRIL DERIVATIVES AS MATRIX METALLOPROTEINASES INHIBITORSTECHNICAL FIELDThe present invention relates to carbostyril derivatives, method of preparing the same, and extracellular matrix metalloproteinases inhibitor.BACKGROUND ARTThe extracellular matrix metalloproteinases are secreted from mammal animal cells, and decomposes extracellular matrix (collagen, type IV collagen, laminin proteoglican, fibronectin, elastin, gelatin, etc.)* Abnormal promotion of secretion and activity of extracellular matrix metalloproteinases are considered to induce various diseases, including metastasis, infiltration and proliferation of cancer cells, rheumatoid arthritis, peridontal diseases, corneal ulcer, osteoporosis, other bone absorption diseases, multiple sclerosis, and the like. Substances showing inhibitory actions of extracellular matrix metalloproteinases include natural products such as TIMP-1, TI P-2, and α2-macroglobulin. Compounds possessing such inhibitory action are disclosed in the Japanese Patent Laid-open Publication No. 62-230757, WO- 905716 and WO-9217460. More specifically, the Japanese Patent
