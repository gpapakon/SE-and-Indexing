<ABSTRACT>
A well screen (1) having slurry flow paths (6) 
enclosed therein includes support rods (3) extending in 

the axial direction of the screen disposed cylindrically 
at a predetermined interval in the circumferential 

direction of the screen, a wire (5) wound on the outer 
periphery of said support rods so as to form slits (4) 

of a predetermined width, one or more flow paths (6) for 
gravel-containing slurry provided inside of the wire 

and extending in the axial direction of the screen, and 
openings (7) for communicating the flow paths with the 

outside of the screen. Lowering and lifting of the 
screen through a wellbore can be made smoothly without 

interfering of the slurry flow paths with the wellbore 
and installation of the screen can thereby be 

faciliated.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates generally to the field of 
oil well, gas well, water well and subterranean 
pollution remediation well equipment and, more 
particularly, to a device which facilitates installation 
of a filtering medium filtering sand and undesirable 
solids from fluids, gases, and toxic extraction from 
subterranean wellbores. Many types of screens and filtering devices are 
known in the art that are designed to exclude sand and 
other solids from fluids and gases produced from oil 
gas, water and pollution remediation wells without undue 
restriction of the production rate of fluids or 
gases. These devices are often used with filter aids, 
such as gravel and/or sand, which are either 
incorporated within the device or separately placed 
surrounding the device. Wire wrapped screens and prepacked screens are 
examples of devices used inside a drilled hole. The 
drilled hole may be left open or may have a casing or 
liner cemented and perforated prior to positioning such 
a device. Openings in such screens may be designed to 
stop, or bridge undesirable solids contained in fluids 
or gases.  Screens and well liners are often surrounded by 
filter aids. The filter aids consist commonly of 
gravel. When used with filter aids or gravel, the 
openings in the screens and liners are designed to stop, 
or bridge, the filter aid and the filter aid is designed 
to stop or bridge the undesirable solids contained in 
the produced fluids or gases. Prepacked screens, porous material filter devices 
and such are examples of devices that incorporate a 
filter medial in the screen body. These devices are 
used for the same purpose and these filter aids commonly 
consist of gravel. Multiple wrapped screens provide two or more 
concentric wire wrappings which act as multiple filters 
in one device to prevent invention of undesirable solids 
and are often used with filter aids, such as gravel, in 
the well bore. One problem that all of these prior art devices 
have in common is that they have no practical means for 
packing gravel in voids or unpacked areas of outside 
gravel which is produced in the screen/wellbore annulus. 
Such voids or unpacked areas constitute a path for 
undesirable sand or solids entering from the 
unsolidified layer to the wellbore which results in 
corrosion of the screen, closure of the screen opening 
and/or filling the inside of the wellbore with  
 
undesirable sand or solids. Such voids or unpacked areas are produced by 
flowing into the inside of the screen of conveying fluid 
which
