<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention provides an improved 
process for the production of alkyl 4-halomethyl-2-methylthiazole-5-carboxylates 
from alkyl 4-(halo)-2-chloroacetoacetate 
and thioacetamide. It is well known that alkyl 4-(halo)-2-chloroacetoacetate 
and thioacetamide may be reacted to 
form alkyl 4-halomethyl-2-methylthiazole-5-carboxylates. 
The process is actually two reactions -- cyclization, 
followed by dehydration. Previous processes for forming 
thiazoles involved acid catalyzed dehydration. U.S. Patent 5,045,554 (Alt et al., 9/91), herein 
incorporated by reference, discloses the reaction of 
ethyl 4,4,4-trifluoro-2-chloroacetoacetate and 
thioacetamide to produce ethyl 2-methyl-4-(trifluoromethyl)thiazole-5-carboxylate, 
which was in 
turn used to produce fungicidal thiazolecarboxanilides. 
The reaction produced the thiazole in one step by 
refluxing the reactants in dimethylformamide, but had 
only a 38% isolated yield. However, a process having higher yields is 
desired for commercial scale production. It is an 
object of the present invention to provide such a 
process. It is a further object of the present 
invention to provide such a process which also results 
in shorter cycle times, allowing for greater production 
capacity. It is a still further object of the present 
invention to provide such a process which also functions 
at lower temperatures and thus requires less heating, 
resulting in energy savings. The present invention provides a process for the 
production of alkyl 4-halomethyl-2-methylthiazole-5-carboxylate  
 
comprising contacting a solution of alkyl 4-(halo)-2-chloroacetoacetate 
in acetonitrile with 
thioacetamide in the presence of an amine, wherein said 
thioacetamide and amine are each in molar excess to said 
alkyl 4-(halo)-2-chloroacetoacetate. The amine may be primary, secondary, or tertiary; 
an alkyl amine is preferred. Triethylamine is highly 
preferred. The molar ratio of thioacetamide is preferably 
between approximately 1.05 and 2.0 per mole of alkyl 4-(halo)-2-chloroacetoacetate, 
more preferably between 
approximately 1.1 and 1.5, most preferably about 1.2. The amine base is also used in molar excess. At 
least 2.0 equivalents are needed to complete the 
reaction and more may be used; the minimum amount needed 
to achieve optimum results is 2.5 equivalents. The base 
must be added subsequent to the initial contact between 
thioacetamide and alkyl 4-(halo)-2-chloroacetoacetate in 
order to obtain the most efficient process. The thioacetamide used in the present
