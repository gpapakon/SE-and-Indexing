<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a signal processing
device for eliminating effectively a noise from a signal
containing a noise such as a signal with a mingling of
noise.Fig. 1 is a diagram showing the outline of a prior art
noise suppression system (Japanese Patent Application
Publication No. 63-500543).In Fig. 1, a voice-plus-noise signal at an input is
divided by a channel divider 19 into many selected channels.
Then, the gain of these individual pre-processed voice
channels is adjusted by a channel gain modifier 21 in
response to a modified signal described later so that the
gain of the channels exhibiting a low voice-to-noise ratio
is reduced. Then, the individual channels comprising the
post-processed voice are recombined in a channel combiner 26
to form a noise-suppressed voice signal available at an
output.Also, the individual channels comprising the pre-processed
voice are applied to a channel energy estimator 20
which serves to generate energy envelope values for each
channel. The post-processed voice is inputted into a 
channel energy estimator 22. The post-processed estimated
channel energy is utilized by a background noise estimator
23 to determine voice/noise.A channel SNR estimator 24 compares the background
noise estimate of the estimator 23 to the channel energy
estimate of the estimator 20 to form an SNR estimate. The
SNR estimate is utilized to select a specified gain value
from a channel gain table comprising experimentally
beforehand determined gains. A channel gain controller 25
generates the individual channel gain values of the modified
signal in response to the SNR estimate.However, such prior art noise suppression system
adjusts the gain to suppress noise without eliminating
noise, so that a sufficiently noise-eliminated signal cannot
be obtained. To overcome this problem, spectral subtraction noise reducing techniques are commonly used. See for instance W.M. Kushner et al.: "The effects of subtractive-type speech enhancement/noise reduction algorithms on parameter estimation for improved recognition and coding in high noise environments", ICASSP 89, vol. 1, 23 May 1989, Glasgow.It is an object of the present invention, as defined in the claim, to provide a
signal processing device for generating a securely noise-eliminated
signal by solving the problem of such prior art
noise suppression system. Fig. 1 is a block diagram showing a prior art noise
suppression system;Fig. 2 is a block diagram showing a
signal processing device;Fig. 3 shows graphs of spectrum and cepstrum in
