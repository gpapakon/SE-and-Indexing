<ABSTRACT>
Hot gas is introduced into a fluidised bed of 
the granular material, for example gypsum, contained in a 

vessel 10 having a grinding device or mill 11 in its lower 
region, which may comprise grinding rollers 15 cooperating 

with a table 17 on the base of the vessel. The gas may 
be supplied through a tube 20 passing down through the 

vessel, while raw material is fed into the bed, preferably 
by a feed screw 34. The ground product is discharged 

from the bed by an overflow 28 which determines the level 
of the bed.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a method of and 
apparatus for heating and grinding materials that are 
capable of being maintained in a fluidised bed. It is 
particularly well suited to calcining and grinding 
materials such as gypsum, which evolve gases or vapours 
serving at least in part to fluidise the bed of material 
under treatment. In the gypsum industry it has traditionally 
been the practice to crush or grind raw gypsum to a 
convenient size which is then calcined to produce calcium 
sulphate hemihydrate (or anhydrite), the dehydrated 
material being subsequently milled as desired to obtain a 
product having a particle size and other characteristics 
appropriate to the intended end use. It has already been proposed to combine the 
calcination and grinding of such materials in a single 
unit. For example, in United States Patent US-A-1,984,201 
sub-divided gypsum is fed to the mill in a stream of hot 
gas, and the ground and calcined material entrained in the 
hot gas together with a stream of cold gas. Fine calcined 
material leaves the unit entrained in the gas stream while 
coarser material falls back into the mill. Techniques in which a so-called fluidized bed 
is employed are known from other industries. In British 
Patent GB-A-1193761 and in a European Patent Application 
published as EP-A-0 039 270, a granular material to be 
dried and/or heated and ground is fed through a pneumatic 
conduit by hot gases into a chamber containing a grinding 
device. The ground product is discharged from the top of 
the chamber by entrainment in the exhaust gases, and in 
the European application a restriction in the cross 
section of the upper part of the chamber (provided by a 
series of transverse bars) causes insufficiently ground 
material to fall back into the grinding zone. In an earlier device described in British  
 
Patent GB-A-1080605 an agglutinant material such as clay 
is ground, sorted and dried in a fluidization reactor 
having a percussion grinder wholly or partly immersed in a 
fluidized bed of the material. In this apparatus, the 
base of the reactor is perforated in the classical manner 
of a fluidized bed reactor, and the hot gases entering the 
reactor through the perforated base not only fluidize the 
material in the bed but also carry off the product from 
the top of the reactor. In these and similar systems the material, even 
if it forms a definable bed at all, is present in a 
relatively low density mixture of gas and solids (i.e. a 
low solid to gas ratio), and the solid to gas

<CLAIMS>
A method of heating and grinding a material 
which comprises: 


introducing hot gas into a bed of the material 
to heat and fluidize the bed; 
grinding the material in the lower region of 
the bed; 
and introducing fresh raw material into the bed 
and withdrawing ground and heated material from the bed; 
 
   characterized in that the material forms an 

established bed from which at least a significant 
proportion of the material withdrawn is discharged by 

gravity flow from the bed. 
A method according to claim 1 in which, as raw 
material is introduced into the fluidised bed, heated and 

ground material is correspondingly discharged by an 
overflow which determines the level of the top of the bed. 
A method according to claim 1 or 2 in which the 
hot gas is introduced into the lower region of the bed 

through one or more tubes extending downwardly through and 
opening into the bed. 
A method according to any preceding claim in 
which the material is ground by rotary grinding elements 

co-operating with a grinding surface which constitutes or 
forms part of a base supporting the fluidised bed. 
A method according to any preceding claim in 
which the material is reacted at the temperature of the 

bed by the heat supplied by the gas. 
A method according to claim 5 in which the 
material is gypsum or other calcinable material which 

evolves gases or vapours during calcination and such gases 
or vapours contribute to fluidisation of the bed of  

 
material.

a vessel (10) adapted to contain a fluidized 
bed of the material; 
a grinding or milling device (11) in the lower

a hot gas feed for the bed;

the vessel (10) above the level of the grinding or milling 

device (11) has tapering walls, such that the cross-section

fluidised bed of material is substantially greater than 
that at the level of the grinding or milling device.

(20) descending through the vessel (10) to an opening in
