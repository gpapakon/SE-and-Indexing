<ABSTRACT>
A print-out layer is incorporated in a donor 
element that is useful in a dry color proofing process 

in which a colored image is transferred from the donor 
element to a receiver. To achieve full color 

reproduction, images are transferred in succession and 
in register, to the receiver from donor elements, 

respectively containing yellow, magenta, cyan and black 
colorants. A visible image is formed in the print-out 

layer as a result of imagewise exposure of the donor 
element to activating radiation and is utilized to 

facilitate visual registration in forming the 
multicolor image on the receiver.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates in general to the 
color proofing art and in particular to processes of 
dry color proofing and elements utilized therein. More 
specifically, this invention relates to a novel donor 
element for use in a dry color proofing process. Prepress color proofing systems are in 
widespread use in the printing industry. In a typical 
process, a multicolor original is separated into 
individual transparencies, called color separations, 
for the three primary colors and for black. The 
separation process can be carried out in a number of 
well-known ways; for example, a graphic arts scanner 
can be used to create the color separations. In some 
instances, more than four color separations are 
employed. A color proof, called an off-press proof or 
a prepress proof, is then prepared from the color 
separations. The color proof is used by the printer to 
check color balance and other important quality control 
parameters. Generally speaking, off-press color proofs 
are made by one of three methods; namely (1) an overlay 
process which employs an image on a separate base for 
each color, (2) a single sheet process is which the 
separate color images are combined on a single base, 
and (3) a digital method in which the images are 
produced directly on a single base from digital data. 
The overlay process and single sheet process are 
discussed in some detail in U.S. Patent 4,895,787 which 
points out that the single sheet process is greatly 
preferred because the superposed supports of the 
overlay process drastically alter the appearance of the 
color proof.  U.S. Patent No. 3,622,320, issued November 
23, 1971, describes a color proofing process of the 
single sheet type that is highly advantageous in that 
it is simple and convenient to use and particularly in 
that it is a dry process which does not require the use 
of processing solutions. As described in the '320 
patent, the color-proofing process utilizes two or more 
light-sensitive donor elements each of which contains a 
different dispersed colorant. The donor elements 
employ a light-sensitive resin which has a tackifying 
point that is raised by light exposure, i.e., a resin 
that is photohardenable. The imagewise-exposed donor 
element is pressed into contact with a receiver while 
heated to a temperature greater than the tackifying 
point before exposure but less than the tackifying 
point in the exposed areas, whereby the colored resin 
transfers from the unexposed areas to the receiver.

<CLAIMS>
A multilayer donor element that is useful 
in a dry color proofing process in which a colored 

image is transferred from said donor element to a 
receiver by a process of lamination; said donor element 

containing a colorant, dispersed throughout at least 
one layer which undergoes imagewise transfer, and 

comprising a support and a photosensitive imaging layer 
comprised of a photohardenable or phototackifiable 

composition whose tackifying temperature is selectively 
changeable by imagewise exposure of said donor element 

to activating radiation; characterized in that said 
donor element additionally comprises a print-out layer 

comprised of a print-out composition that functions to 
form a visible image as a result of said imagewise 

exposure. 
A donor element as claimed in claim 1, 
wherein said print-out layer and said imaging layer are 

on the same or opposite sides of said support. 
A donor element as claimed in claim 1 or 
2, wherein said imaging layer is a photohardenable 

layer containing a photocrosslinkable polymer. 
A donor element as claimed in any of 
claims 1 to 3, wherein said imaging layer is a 

photohardenable layer containing a photocrosslinkable 
p-phenylene diacrylate polyester. 
A donor element as claimed in any of 
claims 1 to 4, wherein said imaging layer is a 

photohardenable layer containing a blend of a low Tg 
crystalline photocrosslinkable polymer with a 

compatible high Tg amorphous photocrosslinkable 
polymer.

claims 1 to 5, wherein said print-out layer is a silver 

halide emulsion layer. 
A donor element as claimed in any of 
claims 1-6, comprising a first photosensitive ima
ging 
layer that is free of said colorant overlying said 

print-out layer and a second photosensitive imaging 
layer that contains said colorant overlying said first 

photosensitive imaging layer. 
A donor element as claimed in claim 7,

photocrosslinkable polymer with a compatible high Tg 

amorphous photocrosslinkable polymer.

8, wherein said first photosensitive imaging layer has 

a thickness that is at least twice that of said second 
photosensitive imaging layer. 
A donor element as claimed in claim 1, 
having a release layer interposed between said imaging 

layer and said print-out layer, said release layer 
adhering more strongly to said print-out layer than to 

said imaging layer or adhering more strongly to said

A method for preparing a prepress color

(3) imagewise exposing to activating
