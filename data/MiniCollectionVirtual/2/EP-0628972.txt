<ABSTRACT>
An electric cable with limited fire survival 
characteristics comprises at least one insulated 

conductor insulated with silicone rubber or other 
organic insulant that leaves an insulating inorganic 

residue on thermal breakdown and optionally a bare earth 
wire. A screening layer is formed by a laminate 

comprising a centre layer of mineral fibre cloth having 
one face formed by a layer of metal foil and the the 

other by a layer of organic material infusible below 
200°C, preferably regenerated cellulose or cured 

isophalate polyester film. An extruded sheath of flame-retardant 
polymeric material contacts, but does not 

adhere to, the infusible film layer of the laminate. 
This separation of the screening layer from the 
sheath ensures that it can be cut back for termination 

with negligible risk of damage to the conductor 
insulation and minimal risk of damage to the essential 

metal layer of the screening laminate. After it has 
been so cut back, the projecting end of the laminate may 

be turned back over the cut end of the sheath to expose 
a metal layer that is sufficiently supported to make an 

effective screen connection by mechanical means.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to electric cables for use in
fire alarm circuits and other installations requiring
maintenance of circuit integrity under fire conditions. In
virtually all such applications, mineral-insulated cables of
appropriate design will perform best, but in some of them a
more limited fire survival capacity may be acceptable and
such factors as ease of installation and modification may
indicate the use of a polymeric-insulated cable with limited
fire survival capacity.Cables intended for such applications have been
available for some years and British Standard BS 7629 has
been adopted in respect of them. The current market leader
(GB-A-1500121) uses silicone-rubber insulated conductors
enclosed together with a bare earth wire in a composite
sheath comprising a main structural sheath of a PVC compound
lined with an aluminium foil/thermoplastic laminate. The
aluminium foil faces inwards and must contact the earth wire
and the thermoplastic layer faces outwards and ensures
adhesion to the main structural sheath. GB-A-2050041 describes
a similar cable in which the silicone rubber is replaced by
an inorganic insulant (such as mica paper) enclosed in an
elastomer (such as EPR). In either case, an inorganic residue
will remain on thermal breakdown of the insulant.Because the aluminium foil in these cables is
adhered to the main structural sheath, the only practicable
way of preparing the end of the cable for jointing or
termination is to cut back the sheath and remove a length of
it as a whole. It has been found that there is a risk that
the cut-back edge of the tough composite sheath may sometimes
be so sharp and burred that it may cause damage to the
underlying insulation of relatively fragile silicone rubber, 
with a potential for electrical failure; and the design is
entirely reliant on the reliability of the contact between
the earth wire and the aluminium foil for effective
electromagnetic screening.It is therefore an object of the invention to
provide an improved form of cable in which, without
significant detriment to fire performance, the sheath and
screening layer can be cut back separately and the screening
layer can be terminated directly, without relying on its
contact with an earth wire.The cable in accordance with the invention
comprises at least one insulated conductor which, or each of
which, is insulated with a polymer-based insulant which
leaves an insulating inorganic residue on thermal breakdown;
optionally a bare earth wire; a surrounding screening layer
which is a laminate

<CLAIMS>
An electric cable comprising at least one
insulated conductor which, or each of which, is insulated

with a polymer-based insulant which leaves an insulating
inorganic residue on thermal breakdown; optionally a bare

earth wire; a surrounding screening layer which is a laminate
having one face formed by a layer of metal foil; and an

extruded sheath of flame-retardant polymeric material which
surrounds the screening layer and contacts the other face of

the laminate 
characterised in that
 the said laminate
comprises a centre layer of mineral fibre cloth and a layer

of an organic film infusible below 200°C which layer provides
the said other face 
and in that
 the said sheath does not
adhere to the said other face.
A cable as claimed in claim 1 in which the
insulant is silicone rubber.
A cable as claimed in claim 1 in which the organic
film layer is selected from regenerated cellulose, cured

polyesters and polyesters melting above 200°C.
A cable as claimed in claim 2 in which the organic
film layer is selected from regenerated cellulose and cured

isophthalate polyesters.
A cable as claimed in any one of the preceding
claims in which the laminate is run as a tape in to the

laying up die or equivalent as the conductors are laid up
together, so as to acquire a slow twist equivalent to the lay

of the conductors.
A cable as claimed in any one of the preceding Claims in
which the sheath is of an "LSF" compound based on a halogen-free

polymer rendered fire-retardant with a filler that
evolves water under fire conditions.
A cable as claimed in any one of the preceding 
claims in which the projecting end of the laminate has been

turned back over a cut end of the sheath to expose a metal
layer to which a screen connection has been made by

mechanical means.
