<ABSTRACT>
The present invention relates to certain novel amide derivatives which are pyrido(3,4-b)indol-2-ylacetamides of formula (I) which are inhibitors of human leukocyte elastase (HLE), also known as human neutrophil elastase (HNE), making them useful whenever such inhibition is desired, such as for research tools in pharmacological, diagnostic and related studies and in the treatment of diseases in mammals in which HLE is implicated. The invention also includes intermediates useful in the synthesis of these amide derivatives, processes for preparing the amide derivatives, pharmaceutical compositions containing such amide derivatives and methods for their use.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to certain amide derivatives, in 
particular, certain pyrido[3,4-b]indol-2-ylacetamides, which are 
inhibitors of human leukocyte elastase (HLE), also known as human 
neutrophil elastase (HNE), making them useful whenever such inhibition 
is desired, such as for research tools in pharmacological, diagnostic 
and related studies and in the treatment of diseases in mammals in 
which HLE is implicated. For example, HLE has been implicated in the 
pathogenesis of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), rheumatoid 
arthritis, atherosclerosis, pulmonary emphysema, and other 
inflammatory disorders, including airway inflammatory diseases 
characterized by increased and abnormal airway secretion such as 
chronic bronchitis and cystic fibrosis. Also, HLE has been implicated 
in certain vascular diseases and related conditions (and their 
therapy) in which neutrophil participation is involved or implicated, 
for example, in hemorrhage associated with acute non-lymphocytic 
leukemia, as well as in reperfusion injury associated with, for 
example, myocardial ischaemia and related conditions associated with 
coronary artery disease such as angina and infarction, cerebrovascular 
ischaemia such as transient ischaemic attack and stroke, peripheral 
occlusive vascular disease such as intermittent claudication and 
critical limb ischaemia, venous insufficiency such as venous 
hypertension, varicose veins and venous ulceration, as well as 
impaired reperfusion states such as those associated with 
reconstructive vascular surgery, thrombolysis and angioplasty. The 
invention also includes intermediates useful in the synthesis of these 
amide derivatives, processes for preparing the amide derivatives, 
pharmaceutical compositions containing such amide derivatives and 
methods for their use. In U.S. Patent 4,910,190, of 20 March 1990, assigned to ICI 
Americas Inc. (now Zeneca Inc.), there is disclosed a series of 
peptidoyl trifluoromethane derivatives which are HLE inhibitors. In J. 
Med.Chem., (1992), 35, 641-662 there are disclosed N-substituted 
peptidyl trifluoromethyl ketones, containing an N-substituted glycine 
residue, having HLE inhibitory properties. Disclosed herein is a 
series of substituted 2-(1,2-dihydro-1-oxopyrido[3,4-b]indol-2-yl)-N-[3,3,3-trifluoro-1-(lower 
alkyl)-2-oxopropyl]acetamide derivatives, 
which unexpectedly possess inhibitory  
 
properties against HLE, which provides the basis for the present 
invention. According to the invention there is provided a
