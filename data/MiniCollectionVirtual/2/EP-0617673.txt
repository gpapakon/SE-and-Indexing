<ABSTRACT>
In vehicles equipped with cruise control systems, which can influence both the engine (1) of the vehicle and a retarder (5), it is ensured that the systems do not counteract each other in that the cruise control system (6) of the engine may remain activated at the same time as the cruise control system (7) of the retarder only if certain operating conditions are met. Such a case may occur if the engine (1) is adjusted to a low level when the cruise control system of the retarder is engaged and/or if the speed of the vehicle or the setpoint to which the cruise control system of the retarder is set is higher than the setpoint for the cruise control system of the engine.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a process and an arrangement 
for vehicle cruise control in accordance with the 
statements made in the preamble to patent claim 1 and 
patent claim 6 respectively. A process of prior art involves the use of a retarder for 
braking a vehicle to a constant speed when driven 
downhill. Patent SE 460 781 (= EP,A,336 913) describes 
such a system in which the retarder control system is 
designed with a cruise control function which, when 
activated, brakes the vehicle so that it is driven at a 
constant speed. The cruise control function must be 
reactivated on every descent where the driver wants the 
cruise control function to be activated. For the 
retarder control systems of modern vehicles are designed 
so that it is not possible to drive the vehicle with the 
retarder engaged whilst the driver has his foot on the 
accelerator in addition to the idle throttle. When the 
vehicle reaches a flat section of road or an uphill 
section after the descent the driver must accelerate, 
thereby automatically disengaging the cruise control 
function. Modern vehicles also have control systems for engine 
regulation which normally also include a function for 
keeping the speed of the vehicle constant by means of 
engine control. This cruise control function is 
therefore designed mainly for driving on flat roads and 
uphill, where the driving resistance of the vehicle is so 
great that the accelerator must be pressed to maintain 
the speed of the vehicle. This type of cruise control is 
therefore based on the fact that the engine is adjusted 
by a suitable throttle to maintain a constant vehicle 
speed. With only this type of regulation the vehicle  
 
speed will increase to a value exceeding the speed 
setpoint determined by the cruise control when the 
vehicle encounters a descent of sufficient gradient on 
which the engine braking function is insufficient to 
maintain the speed. Where the vehicle is equipped with both these types of 
cruise control functions, retarder and engine control, it 
is important that they do not counteract each other. For 
this reason the cruise control function is automatically 
disengaged by means of the engine control system when the 
cruise control function is activated by means of the 
retarder control system. Otherwise there is a risk that 
the engine control system may adjust the engine to full 
throttle whilst the retarder system simultaneously 
adjusts the retarder to maximum braking. The objective of this invention is to provide a system 
for

Process for keeping constant the speed of a vehicle 
in which an engine control unit (6) is arranged to 

control the driving engine (1) of the vehicle, and in 
which a retarder control unit (7) is arranged to control 

a retarder (5) connected to the transmission of the 
vehicle, where the engine control (6) and the retarder 

control (7) each incorporates a cruise control function 
which, by regulation of the engine (1) and the retarder 

(5)respectively, endeavours to maintain a constant 
vehicle speed when they are activated,
characterised
 in that when the cruise control 
function of the retarder control unit (7) is activated, 

whilst the cruise control function of the engine control 
unit (6) has been activated previously, an operating 

parameter for the vehicle is sensed and compared with a 
predetermined value, and it is determined on the basis of 

the comparison whether the cruise control function of the 
engine control unit (6) is to be disengaged or not. 
Process for keeping a constant speed according to 
claim 1, 
characterised
 in that the sensed 
operating parameter represents the driving torque of the 

engine (1), and in that the cruise control function of 
the engine control unit remains in an activated po
sition 
if the sensed parameter is below the predetermined 

position. 
Process for keeping a constant speed according to 
claim 1, 
characterised
 in that the sensed 
operating parameter represents a speed. 
Process for keeping a constant speed according to 
claim 2, 
characterised
 in that the 
predetermined value represents a torque corresponding to 

that generated by the engine (1) during idling.  
 
Process according to claim 1 for activating two 
cruise control systems (6, 7), in which the first cruise 

control system (6) is designed to ensure, by controlling 
the engine throttle, that the speed of the vehicle does 

not drop below a determined speed setpoint, and in which 
the second cruise control system (7) is designed, by 

adjusting the braking effect in an additional brake (5) 
in the drive line of the vehicle, to ensure that the 

speed of the vehicle does not exceed a determined speed 
setpoint, where the first and second cruise control 

system (6, 7) respectively can be activated selectively 
so that simultaneous activation is possible, 


characterised
 in that when the second 
cruise control system (7) is activated, whilst the first 

system (6) is simultaneously activated, the first 
cruise control system (6) is maintained in the active 

condition only if its degree of adjustment is below a first 
predetermined value, and when the first cruise control 

system (6) begins to control the engine effect, 
corresponding to a degree of adjustment above a second 

predetermined value, the second cruise control system (7) 
is deactivated.

a torque equivalent to 5 per cent of the maximum engine 

torque which can be generated.
