<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to 
polyester/rubber modified graft copolymer blends, 
and more particularly, relates to polybutylene 
terephthalate/acrylonitrile-butadiene-styrene 
graft copolymer blends exhibiting improved 
surface appearance. Blends of polybutylene terephthalate resin 
and acrylonitrile-butadiene-styrene graft 
copolymers are known. When such blends are 
injection molded they often exhibit chattering 
surface blemishes. Consequently, there is a desire to provide 
polybutylene terephthalate resin/acrylonitrilebutadiene-styrene 
graft copolymer blends that 
exhibit improved surface appearances following 
injection molding thereof. The present invention involves thermoplastic 
compositions comprising polybutylene 
terephthalate resin, a rubber modified graft 
copolymer, a non-grafted rigid vinyl 
aromatic/vinyl cyanide copolymer, and an amount 
of a metal salt of a monocarboxylic fatty acid 
sufficient to improve the surface appearance of 
the composition upon injection molding thereof. 
The compositions are useful for making molded 
articles.  Thermoplastic polyester resins such as 
polyalkylene terephthalate resins, and 
specifically polybutylene terephthalate resins 
(also referred to herein as polybutylene 
terephthalates and polybutylene terephthalate 
polymers) are well known in the art. Suitable 
polybutylene terephthalate polymers are 
disclosed, for example, in U.S. Patents Nos. 
4,066,627; 4,184,033; 4,069,278 and 4,593,077, 
all of which are incorporated herein by 
reference. The polybutylene terephthalate resins 
contains at least 90 mole percent, based on the 
dicarboxylic acid component, of terephthalic acid 
residues and at least 90 mole percent, based on 
the diol component of 1,4 butane diol residues. In addition to terephthalic acid residues, 
the polybutylene terephthalates may contain up to 
10 mole percent of residues of other aromatic, 
aliphatic or cycloaliphatic dicarboxylic acids, 
for example succinic acid, adipic acid or 
isophthalic acid residues. In addition to butane 
diol residues, they may contain up to 10 mole 
percent of residues of another diol which may 
correspond to the following formula: 
HO-CnH2n-OHin which n is an integer of from 2 to 10. More 
particularly, up to 10 mole percent of alkyl-substituted 
diols such as neopentyl glycol, 
2,2,4-trimethyl-1,6-hexane diol, 2-ethyl-1,3-propane 
diol, 2,2,4-trimethyl-1,3-pentane diol, 
2-methyl-2,4-pentane diol, 3-methyl-2,4-pentane 
diol or 2-ethyl-1,3-hexane diol may also be  
 
incorporated (German
