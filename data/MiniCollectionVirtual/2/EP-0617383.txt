<ABSTRACT>
A data storage device (9) comprises an array of electronic memory locations 
(20) for storing data. An address input terminal (10) provides coupling to an 

address source and is coupled to provide first address signals from the 
address source to address the memory locations of the array (20). A data 

output terminal (12) provides coupling to a data reception arrangement and 
is connected to the array (20) for receiving data signals therefrom in 

response to the address signals. The data signals are indicative of the data 
stored in the memory locations addressed by the address signals. An 

address encryption arrangement (14) is coupled between the address input 
terminal (10) and the array (20) for encrypting the first address signals. The 

address encryption arrangement (14) contains encrypting data which is 
protected from direct optical determination, the encrypting data being used 

to encrypt the first address signals.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates generally to data storage devices. Data storage devices, for example, smart cards containing bank account 
details in the form of data values stored in integrated circuit (IC) memory 
addresses, are at risk from fraudulent optical detection by the removal of the 
plastic encapsulation around the IC, etching away covering layers and 
applying a selectively absorbable stain to render the memory data optically 
visible. It is known that address encrypting arrangements may be used, which result 
in the data values being arranged non-sequentially within the IC memory. 
The data therefore appears meaningless if optically analysed, but can be 
legitimately accessed through the address encrypting arrangement. A 
problem with this arrangement is that by performing the same optical 
detection techniques as mentioned above, one could learn the encrypting 
details on which the encrypting arrangement is based and thus could make 
sense of the data within the IC. This invention seeks to provide a data storage device in which the above 
mentioned disadvantage is mitigated. A data storage device comprises an array of electronic memory locations for 
storing data. An address input terminal provides coupling to an address 
source and is coupled to provide first address signals from the address source 
to address the memory locations of the memory array. A data output 
terminal provides coupling to a data reception arrangement and is connected 
to the memory array for receiving data signals therefrom in response to the 
address signals. The data signals are indicative of the data stored in the  
 
memory locations addressed by the address signals. An address encryption 
arrangement is coupled between the address input terminal and the array 
for encrypting the first address signals. The address encryption 
arrangement contains encrypting data which is protected from direct optical 
determination, the encrypting data being used to encrypt the first address 
signals. The array of data memory may be a Read-Only-Memory containing data 
which is stored in an encrypted manner, the encryption thereof being 
matched with the arrangement of the encrypting data. The address encryption arrangement may include a latch for receiving the 
encrypting data from the non-volatile-memory, such that the non-volatile-memory 
can operate independently from the address encryption 
arrangement during normal operation. It will be appreciated that in this way one cannot learn the encrypting 
details on which the encrypting
