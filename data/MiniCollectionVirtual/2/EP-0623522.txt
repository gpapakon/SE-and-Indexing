<ABSTRACT>
The present invention relates to a plastic screw cap for container closures having a child-resistant safeguard, having an inside cap (1) with an internal thread (13) which can be screwed onto a neck or the nozzle of a container to receive a closure, and having an outside cap (2) which can be turned freely, at least in the opening direction, relative to the inside cap (1), engagement elements (7, 8, 9, 10) being provided between the inside and the outside cap (1, 2), which engagement elements which can be engaged non-positively in the opening direction only when exerting a force which is to be applied in addition to the tangential force bringing about the opening moment and is not to act solely tangentially. In order to provide a closure or a plastic screw cap with the features mentioned at the beginning, which has a high functional reliability regardless of the type of contents used and is easy to actuate, it is proposed according to the invention that the bases (3, 4) of the inside cap (1) and the outside cap (2) engage in one another by means of a cylindrical projection (5), arranged concentrically to the closure axis, on the one base (3, 4) and a cylindrical cutout (6), likewise arranged concentrically to the closure axis, on the other base (4, 3), the cutout (6) having a slightly larger diameter than the projection (5).
