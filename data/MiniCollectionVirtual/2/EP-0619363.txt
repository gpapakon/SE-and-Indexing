<ABSTRACT>
An aqueous liquid detergent composition is provided for cleaning a hard 
surface and for repelling insects therefrom comprising a detersive proportion of a 

surface active detergent compound, an effective amount of at least one of certain 
defined insect repellent materials which is sufficient to repel insect from the hard 

surface after application of the detergent composition thereto, the liquid detergent 
composition being substantially free of a liquid hydrocarbon.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to liquid detergent compositions suitable for cleaning 
hard surfaces and which impart insect repelling properties. More particularly, this 
invention relates to liquid all purpose detergent compositions containing an insect 
repellent material, and to a process for cleaning and repelling insects from surfaces 
and articles to which such detergent compositions are applied. Many types of insects common in households, such as German (Blattela 
germanica) or house cockroaches, are classified as pests, and much effort has 
been made to eradicate or at least to control them. Mosquito repellents have long 
been marketed and various chemicals that are effective in repelling roaches have 
been discovered. Typically, these chemicals and repellents are used in the 
household by applying or spraying them to surfaces of walls, floors, cabinets, 
drawers, packages, containers, rugs, upholstery and carpeting, and in potential 
nesting places for insects, such as inside walls and between floors. However, 
heretofore insect repellents have not been generally used in conjunction with hard 
surface cleaners so as to effectively clean a hard household surface, such as a 
kitchen wall, oven top, bathroom floor or the like, while at the same time applying a 
film of insect repellent material which is sufficiently substantive to the surface to 
which the composition is applied to repel insects therefrom. The incorporation of an insect repellent into a polishing product for 
household floors is known in the art. U.S. Patent 3,018,217 to Bruce discloses floor 
wax coating compositions containing dibutyl succinate as an insect repellent. U.S. 
Patent 3,034,950 to Goodhue et al, discloses a class of insect repellent compounds 
which may be applied to surfaces dispersed in a wax. In U.S. 4,455,308 to 
Smolanoff, there are described insect repellent formulations containing a liquid  
 
carrier such as liquid aliphatic or aromatic hydrocarbons. An emulsifying agent 
such as a nonionic surfactant may be added to the liquid hydrocarbon to permit the 
composition to be dispersed in water for end use application. U.S. Patent 
4,822,614 to Rodero, discloses an insect-repellent ingredient in a hydrocarbon-based 
solvent such as isoparaffinic hydrocarbons. The present invention provides an aqueous liquid detergent composition 
capable of cleaning a hard surface and repelling insects therefrom comprising (i) a 
detersive proportion of a surface active detergent compound selected from the 
group consisting of anionic,
