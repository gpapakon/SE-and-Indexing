<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to electrically operated fuel injectors for 
internal combustion engines. Known electrically operated fuel injectors which impart a swirling 
component of motion to the fuel being injected place the largest portion of 
the pressure drop across the swirl-inducing device. Such fuel injectors 
either retain a relatively large volume of "dead" or non-swirl fuel below the 
swirl-inducing device or else place the swirl-inducing device downstream 
of the valve seat where the possibility of objectionable post-injection drip 
may exist. In either case, the quality of the injection may be compromised 
by the introduction of a certain amount of non-swirl fuel into the 
combustion chamber. Accordingly, there is room for further improvement 
in enhancing the swirling character of an injected fuel cloud. In order for a spark-ignited internal combustion engine to exhibit 
acceptable part throttle (part load) operation, it has been found important 
that a fuel injector create a finely atomized cloud of fuel that is distributed 
over a large extent of the combustion chamber volume close to, but 
preferably not colliding with, the combustion chamber walls. The present invention is directed toward a novel fuel injector that 
operates to enhance the swirling character of the injected fuel cloud. It 
has been discovered that the invention can create an injected fuel cloud 
which possesses a distinctly toroidal shape. Such discovery has been 
made and measured through the use of sophisticated photo-optical 
techniques including stroboscopic photography, helium-neon laser beam 
diffraction, and principles including Fraunhofer diffraction. As engine 
speed increases, it is desirable that the injected fuel cloud become 
increasingly spaced from the combustion chamber wall. By having a 
small dead-volume, a fuel injector according to the present invention is 
especially suitable for high-speed operation such as that which can occur 
in a two-stroke engine, and in such case, the fuel injector is supplied with 
fuel which is pressurized to a pressure that is considerably higher than  
 
that customarily used in today's fuel injection systems for four-stroke 
engines. Additionally, the invention is capable of producing a relatively 
circumferentially uniform swirl in the injected fuel from a limited number of 
circumferentially separated swirl passages in the swirl inducing device. The closest known art is represented by US-A-4 805 837 which 
discloses a fuel injector comprising a valve body having a main

<CLAIMS>
A fuel injector (10) comprising 

a valve body (12) having a main longitudinal axis (18) and 
comprising an inlet (14) via which pressurized liquid fuel is introduced 

into said valve body, 
a valve seat member (48) comprising a frusto-conical surface 
containing a valve seat (52) and circumscribing a fuel outlet (54), 
a fuel path extending through said valve body between said inlet 
and said outlet, 
a needle guide and fuel swirl member (34) disposed within said 
valve body and comprising an axially upstream face that is toward said 

inlet and an axially downstream face that is toward said outlet,
 
   said needle guide and fuel swirl member's axially 

downstream face cooperating with said valve seat member to define a 
swirl chamber space (56), 
an electrically operated mechanism (20, 22, 28) disposed on said 
valve body and comprising an axially reciprocal armature means (28) and 

bias means (60) for axially reciprocating over a given stroke a needle 
valve member (30) that passes through a guide hole (46) in said needle 

guide and 
fuel swirl member and has a tip end (32) confronting said seat 
member such that said tip end is seated on and unseated from said valve 

seat to close and open said fuel path,
 
   said needle guide and fuel swirl member comprising plural 

swirl passages (58;58A) extending through said needle guide and fuel 
swirl member between said axially upstream and downstream faces 

thereof in directions that are skew to said axis and opening at said 
downstream face of said needle guide and fuel swirl member toward said 

frusto-conical surface in spaced upstream relation to said valve seat such 
that fuel exiting said swirl passages flows with a circumferential 

component of motion about said axis as it passes through said swirl 
chamber space toward said outlet, characterized by 
the total flow area for fuel to enter said swirl chamber space by 
passing from said upstream face to said downstream face of said needle  

 
guide and fuel swirl member being greater than the flow area (at "H") for 

fuel to pass between said tip end of said needle valve member and said 
valve seat for all positions of said needle valve member along its stroke, 

and 
the flow area for fuel to exit said swirl chamber space by passing 
through said outlet being greater than that (at "H") for fuel to pass 

between said tip end of said needle valve member and said valve seat for 

all positions of said needle valve member along its stroke. 
A fuel injector as set forth in claim 1 characterized further 
by means for operating said mechanism such that after said needle valve 

member (30) has been open-stroked, it is closed-stroked before a 
steady-state flow through the injector is attained.

increase and such that said valve member is operated from open to 

closed before a steady state flow is attained to cause the circumferential 
component of flow to decrease wherein the result of such opening and
