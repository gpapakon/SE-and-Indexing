<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a particle of sodium 
percarbonate which has high storage stability and which is 
useful for a synthetic detergent for family use containing 
a bleach component, etc., and a method for its preparation. It is well known that hydrogen peroxide, such as in 
sodium percarbonate and sodium perborate, is formulated in 
a powdery detergent composition (synthetic detergent for 
family use) as a bleach component. Hydrogen peroxide, such 
as in sodium percarbonate and sodium perborate, dissolves 
in laundry to perform bleaching action. In this case, the solubility rate of sodium perborate 
at a low temperature is small, so it is not preferable for 
a bleach component formulated in a detergent in Japan, 
where cold water or tepid water is used in laundry. On the 
other hand, the solubility rate of sodium percarbonate at 
a low temperature is high, and the bleaching effect is 
sufficiently performed, so the need for it has increased 
rapidly in recent years. However, sodium percarbonate is relatively sensitive 
to water content and is easy dissolved at room temperature 
by water content in a detergent composition or by moisture  
 
or water content in the air. Further, there is a case that 
substances such as zeolites or enzymes, which accelerate 
the dissolution of sodium percarbonate, are contained in 
detergent composition, and it is dissolved by contacting 
with the substances. Thus, until this time, several methods in which the 
dissolution of sodium percarbonate is prevented or 
prohibited to obtain stabilized sodium percarbonate have 
been suggested. For example, there are methods in which 
stability is performed by adding a stabilizer such as 
sodium metasilicate, a magnesium compound and a chelating 
agent at the time of crystallization; by adding additives 
such as a binder or phosphates at the time of wet 
granulation; and by coating a dried surface of sodium 
percarbonate. Among these, the third method (that is, the method in 
which a particle of sodium percarbonate is coated by 
several kinds of coating agents) is the most powerful 
method. As the coating agent, a salt of alkaline earth metal 
or a mixture of sodium carbonate and sodium sulfate, etc., 
are suggested. As the method in which a particle is coated with an 
alkaline earth metal salt, the method described in Japanese 
Patent Publication Sho 57-7081, 
which corresponds to FR-A- 2 424 228, 
is known. This method is  
 
the method in which the surface of sodium percarbonate is 
catalytically reacted with an
