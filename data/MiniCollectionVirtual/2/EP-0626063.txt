<ABSTRACT>
The microwave-operated level gauge contains an aerial for transmitting waves to the surface of contents, the level of which is to be measured, and for receiving the echo waves reflected from the surface and a reception and evaluation circuit which calculates an echo function from the echo waves received by the aerial representing the echo amplitudes as a function of distance and finds the travelling time of the microwaves from the area to the contents surface from the echo function and determines the distance of the surface from the aerial therefrom. In order to detect encrustations of the contents on the aerial or other interference, e.g. damage to or loss of the aerial, the level gauge has an arrangement which compares a section of the echo function arising from a reference reflection point in the aerial or in its close vicinity with a predetermined threshold and generates a signal which indicates whether the threshold has been exceeded in either direction. The reference reflection point may be formed by a part of the aerial or a separate reference reflector fitted in or close to the aerial.

<CLAIMS>
A level measuring device using microwaves comprising an 
antenna for sending transmitted waves toward the surface of a 

material whose level is to be measured, and for the reception 
of echo waves resulting from reflection at the surface, and a 

receiving and evaluating circuit adapted to derive from the 
echo waves received by the antenna an echo function representative 

of the echo amplitudes as a function of the distance and 
to determine from the echo function the transit time of the microwaves 

from the antenna to the surface of the material and 
therefrom the distance of the surface of the material from the 

antenna, characterized by an arrangement for comparing a section 
of the echo function originating from a reference reflection 

point in the antenna or in the vicinity of the antenna 
with a predetermined threshold value, and for producing a 

signal indicating whether the threshold value is exceeded or 
fallen short of. 
The level measuring device as claimed in claim 1, characterized 
in that the reference reflection point is constituted 

by a part of the antenna. 
The level measuring device as claimed in claim 2, characterized 
in that the antenna comprises a horn feeder and in 

that the reference reflection point is constituted by the edge 
of the horn feeder. 
The level measuring device as claimed in claim 1, characterized 
in that the reference reflection point is constituted 

by a reference reflector mounted in the antenna or in the vicinity 
thereof.  

 
The level measuring device as claimed in claim 4, characterized 
in that the antenna comprises a horn feeder and in 

that the reference reflector is mounted at the edge of the horn 
feeder. 
The level measuring device as claimed in any one of the 
preceding claims, characterized in that the receiving and 

evaluating circuit comprises an arrangement for producing an 
envelope signal representing the echo function, in that at 

least one comparator is provided, which at one input receives 
the envelope signal and at another input receives a threshold 

value signal and at its output provides a signal, which dependent 
on which of its input signals possesses the greater value, 

assumes the one or the other of two signal values, and in that 
control logic circuitry is provided which supplies each comparator 

with an enable signal which permits comparison during a 
time window, wherein the echo signal stemming from the reference 

reflection point appears in the echo function. 
The level measuring device as claimed in claim 6, characterized 
in that several comparators are provided, which receive 

different threshold value signals and/or different enable 
signals. 
The level measuring device as claimed in claim 7, characterized 
in that the outputs of the comparators are connected 

with evaluating logic circuitry.
