<ABSTRACT>
A method of fabricating debris intolerant devices 
30
, and especially 
micro-mechanical devices such as DMDs, that allows wafers to be sawn prior 

to completing all fabrication steps. Some devices are too fragile to allow 
cleaning operations to be performed after fabrication of the device. A 

solution is to saw and clean the wafers prior to completing the fabrication 
steps that make the device fragile. To prevent having to process the chips 
30
 
individually, a substrate wafer 
28
 is attached to the backside of the dicing 
tape 
24
. This substrate wafer holds the sawn chips 
30
 in alignment allowing 
the remaining fabrication steps to be performed in wafer form.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to the field of integrated circuit processing, more
particularly to
a method for fabricating debris intolerant devices.In order for integrated circuit (IC) processing to be cost effective, the
individual devices, or chips, must be mass produced by using a
semiconductor wafer to make many chips on a single substrate
simultaneously. This reduces the handling necessary, because processing
equipment must only move and align one wafer instead of many chips.
Alignment, or registration, is very critical for several steps in the IC
fabrication process including lithography and die testing. After all wafer
level processing has been done, the chips are cut or broken apart and
packaged. When the devices are cut from a wafer, wafer particles and dust,
also known as dicing debris, are created. This dicing debris is then washed
from the surface of the IC prior to bonding the chip to the package.Micro-mechanical devices often have structures that are too fragile to
survive exposure to some of the standard IC fabrication steps. An example is
the digital micro-mirror device (DMD). DMDs are explained in U.S. Patent
No. 5,061,049 by Dr. Hornbeck which is assigned to the assignee of this
patent. As described in the aforementioned patent, DMDs have a very small
mirror suspended over an air gap above electrodes formed on the surface of a
silicon substrate. Once this mirror is formed and the sacrificial material
etched from the air gap, the DMD is very fragile. The devices cannot be 
washed without destroying the mirror. Therefore, the devices must be cut
and the dicing debris washed away before etching the sacrificial material
away from the mirror. This requires that the cleaning and etching steps, and
any following steps including passivation and testing, be performed on the
individual chips instead of a wafer.From Patent Abstracts of Japan, vol. 11, no. 265 (E-535),
JP-A-62 069 635, a supporting jig for a semiconductor wafer
is known, wherein a middle layer is formed on a substrate
and allowed to harden. An adhesive layer is formed on the
middle layer, and a semiconductor wafer is pasted to the
adhesive layer. The semiconductor wafer is cut in a dicing
unit, and thereafter, the semiconductor wafer as supported
by the substrate is transported to a mounting unit whereat
the semiconductor chips are installed on a lead frame. To
allow the semiconductor chips to be easily peeled off, the
adhesive force of the adhesive layer is reduced by
irradiation with ultraviolet light.It is an object of the invention
