<ABSTRACT>
Method for arranging a series of products (17, 106) which are moving in succession in the downstream direction along a conveyor belt (2, 103, 104), in such a way that they go into phase with a processing unit connected downstream, in which, for the purpose of controlling an activation element for arranging the products, before a product passes the element, the first speed Vx of the products upstream and the second speed Vy downstream of said element, the position Yn of the product processing unit, and the position Z of the element are measured, the distance Xn which is covered by said detected product from the abovementioned position is determined, the required position Za of the element (9, 113) and the required speed Vya are calculated from Vx, Vy, Xn and Yn, the measured position Z and the measured second speed Vy are compared with the required position Za and the required second speed Vya respectively, following which, if a deviation is found between the measured position Z and the required position Za or the measured speed Vy and the required speed Vya, the element is moved or the second speed Vy is changed.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a method and a device according to the preamble of claims 1 and 4. The present invention aims to cover a wide field of 
application, but the emphasis here is placed on the field of individual 
or combined packaging of products. This field covers many types of 
product, including sticky products which cannot tolerate being pushed 
together, such as pieces of cheese or thin bars of chocolate, or products 
of differing sizes. One of the envisaged fields of application is the packaging of 
products in so-called multipacks. Such packs each contain a group of 
individually packaged articles. This group of individually packaged 
articles is packaged into multipacks in a multipack machine. For this, a 
continuous stream of individually packaged articles is fed to the 
multipacks machine, in the course of which said individually packaged 
articles must be combined to form groups. For example, these individually 
packaged articles are fed in directly from, for example, a production 
machine or a single-pack machine which is set up, for example, relatively 
close to the multipack machine. However, the articles can also be 
supplied from an intermediate stock, so that, for example, different 
production or single-pack machines can supply products to one multipack 
machine. The groups of products to be supplied to the multipack machine 
must have a constant product pitch. However, the stream of packaged 
articles with spacing between them, produced by, for example, a single-pack, 
machine is not always constant. This is because, for example, packs 
which have been rejected are taken out of the stream, and because the 
production speed of a single-pack machine depends on the supply of 
articles to be supplied to it for individual packaging. Although most  
 
products consequently move up to the multipack machine with essentially 
little deviation relative to an average product pitch, great deviations 
from said average product pitch will regularly occur. An intelligent 
system is therefore required for grouping individually packaged products, 
since the products to be combined into a group do not need to lie a fixed 
distance apart for purposes of combination. A device which operates according to the method described in 
the preamble of claim 1 is known from EP-A-0 418 938. 
In this case the top part of an endless conveyor belt and the 
top part of an endless chain work in parallel at a distance from each 
other. The endless chain is driven at a slower speed than the conveyor 
belt. Products
