<ABSTRACT>
The hot crude gas containing slag droplets is passed in a slag separator in an inlet chamber downwards through a first bed of packings into a flow reversal space. In the flow reversal space the crude gas is diverted upwards and flows in an outlet chamber through a second bed of packings upwards to a gas outlet. The effective flow velocity of the crude gas in the region of the first bed is 1.5 to 10 times as high as in the region of the second bed. Liquid slag is taken off from the flow reversal space.

<CLAIMS>
A method for separating slag droplets out of a 
crude gas from the combustion or gasification of solid 

or liquid fuels, the crude gas being at temperatures in 
the range of 1100 to 1800째C and a pressure of 1 to 

40 bar, characterised in that the crude gas containing 
the slag droplets flows in a slag separator in an inlet 

chamber downwards through a first bed of packing into a 
flow-reversal space, is deflected upwards in the flow-reversal 

space and in an outlet chamber flows upwards 
through a second bed of packing to a gas outlet, the 

effective flow velocity of the combustion gas in the 
region of the first bed being 1.5 to 10 times as high 

as in the region of the second bed, and that liquid 
slag is removed from the flow-reversal space. 
A method according to Claim 1, characterised in 
that the angle of deflection between the directions of 

flow of the combustion gas in the inlet chamber and the 
outlet chamber is 90째 to 180째. 
A method according to Claim 1 or 2, characterised 
in that the combustion gas flows through a bed of 

packing in the flow-reversal space. 
A method according to one of Claims 1 to 3, 
characterised in that the surface area of the internal 

cross-section, measured in a horizontal plane, in the 
outlet chamber is 1.5 to 10 times as large as in the 

inlet chamber. 
A method according to one of Claims 1 to 4, 
characterised in that the lower region of the flow-reversal 

space is heated.  
 
A method according to one of Claims 1 to 5, 
characterised in that the crude gas containing the slag 

droplets is first passed through a pre-cleaner which 
deflects the crude gas and then into the inlet chamber 

of the slag separator. 
An apparatus for separating slag droplets out of a 
crude gas from the combustion or gasification of solid 

or liquid fuels, the crude gas being at temperatures in 
the range of 1100 to 1800째C and a pressure in the range 

of 1 to 40 bar,-characterised by a slag separator with 
an inlet chamber which contains a first bed of packing, 

at least one outlet chamber arranged next to the inlet 
chamber and containing a second bed of packing, and a 

flow-reversal space with a slag tap arranged beneath 
the inlet chamber and the outlet chamber. 
An apparatus according to Claim 7, characterised 
in that a pre-cleaner is arranged in the inlet chamber.
