<ABSTRACT>
Method of making heat-transferred dye prints comprising the 
consecutive steps of laminating a photosensitive recording material 

comprising a subbed transparent support and a photopolymerizable 
layer onto a dye (precursor) material comprising an unsubbed support 

and a heat-transferable dye (precursor) layer so as to bring the 
photopolymerizable layer in contact with the heat-transferable dye 

(precursor) layer and to cause the photopolymerizable layer to 
adhere to the heat-transferable dye (precursor) layer, exposing the 

resulting laminate through the subbed transparent film support to 
image-wise modulated electromagnetic radiation, to which the 

photopolymerizable layer is sensitive, to bring about an image-like 
differentiation in adhesiveness of said photopolymerizable layer 

towards the adjacent heat-transferable dye (precursor) layer, 
peeling said recording material from said dye (precursor) material, 

heat-transferable dye (precursor) being taken away thereby from said 
dye (precursor) material and adhering to said recording material in 

correspondence with the created image-like differentiation in 
adhesiveness, bringing said recording material carrying a 

transferred dye (precursor) pattern in contact with a receptor 
material, and overall heating the contacting materials to allow at 

least part of the dye (precursor) pattern to transfer to said 
receptor material, causing - in the case of said dye precursor - 

reaction of said dye precursor on the receptor material with a 
reagent present in said receptor material or in a fluid medium 

applied thereto to convert said dye precursor into a dye.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method of making heat-transferred 
dye prints. Several methods are known for transferring heat-diffusible dye 
from an overall heated element comprising such dye in combination 
with an image-wise distribution of photopolymerized areas and 
unpolymerized areas onto a receiving element, the photopolymerized 
areas inhibiting or reducing the diffusion of the dye to the 
receiving element. It is for instance known from US-A 3,245,796 to use a 
photopolymerizable element comprising a mixture of an α,β-ethylenically 
unsaturated compound and a sublimable dye for forming 
by photo-initiated addition polymerization of said α,β-ethylenically 
unsaturated compound a mask containing insoluble areas, through 
which the passage of the sublimable dye is impeded, and to overall 
heat the mask-containing element while in contact with a receptor 
surface so that transfer of the sublimable dye from the non-polymerized 
areas to the contacting receptor surface can take place. In US-A 4,587,198 a process has been described for providing a 
colour image comprising exposing a photoresist-type material 
comprising in the order given a support, a vapour-deposited dye or 
pigment layer, and a radiation-sensitive coating to an image-wise 
distribution of radiation that alters the solubility and/or 
permeability of said coating and uniformly heating said material 
while in contact with a receptor to evaporate said sublimable dye or 
pigment and deposit it on the contacting receptor. In EP-A 362,827 an image-forming method has been described, 
which comprises the steps of using an image-forming medium 
containing a heat-diffusible colouring matter, a polymerizable 
polymer precursor, and a polymerization initiator, causing the 
polymerizable polymer precursor to image-wise polymerize, and 
heating the imaged medium while in contact with a receiving medium 
to diffusion-transfer the heat-diffusible colouring matter thereto, 
the heating being such as to satisfy the formula 
Tg1≦Ttrans≦Tg2  
,  
 
wherein Ttrans represents the temperature of the image-forming 
medium, Tg1 represents the glass transition temperature of 
unpolymerized areas, and Tg2 the glass transition temperature of 
polymerized areas. The prior art materials and methods used so far often have the 
disadvantage of providing an unwanted hue or fog in the background 
areas. It is therefore an object of the present invention to provide an 
improved method of making heat-transferred dye prints. This and other objects of the present

laminating a photosensitive recording material comprising a subbed 
transparent synthetic resin film support and a photopolymerizable 

layer onto a dye or dye precursor material comprising an unsubbed
