<ABSTRACT>
A safety device is disclosed for stopping the 
fall of a carriage (1) slidably mounted to non 

horizontal guides (3) and suspended by a series of 
tensile stressed sustaining members (2, 4). 
The safety device comprises means (5) capable of 
detecting a breaking occurring in said series of 

tensile stressed sustaining members (2, 4). The 
detecting means (5) are mounted to the carriage (1) 

and operationally connected to locking means (8) 
fitted on the carriage and adjacent the guides (3). 

The locking means (8) are movable from a starting 
non-operational position close to the guides (3) to a 

final operational position in which the locking means 
(8) engage the guides (3), whereby the carriage (1) 

is stopped from falling.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention pertains to the field of 
civil or mining engineering works where several kinds 
of machines are used for soil consolidation, 
drilling, foundation construction, and the like. More 
in particular, the present invention refers to an 
anti-fall safety device for mounting on machines 
having heavy loads slidably suspended on non-horizontal 
guides. Should one of the sustaining 
members break, the load is likely to collapse causing 
serious damage to people and/or outfits. Many soil consolidation machines provide a 
vertical or inclined tower having guides on which a 
carriage is able to slide sustained by cables or 
chains. Other outfits that are necessary for the 
particular function of the machine are mounted on the 
carriage. Several series-connected members (cables, 
chains, tension rods, etc.) sustain the carriage in 
the desired position. Breakdown of one of these 
members may result in the whole carriage and relevant 
outfit falling down. Safety in known machines at present relies only 
on correct sizing of the carriage sustaining members, 
but no particular arrangement is provided for  
 
accidental breaking of one of such members. None of the known commercial apparatuses provide 
carriage sustaining means disposed in parallel, i.e. 
acting simultaneously, nor safety devices capable of 
being operated locking the carriage on the tower in 
case one of the load sustaining members should break. It is an object of this invention to provide a 
device capable of increasing safety with outfits 
having suspended loads slidably mounted on guides. It is another object of this invention to 
provide a device that is activated and locks the load 
on the guides at the precise moment of a breaking 
occurring in one of the carriage sustaining members. These and further objects and advantages, which 
will be more apparent from the ensuing description, 
are attained according to the invention by a device 
according to claim 1. The structural and operational characteristics 
of two preferred but non-limiting embodiments of a 
device according to the invention are described 
hereinafter with reference to the accompanying 
drawings, in which: 
Figure 1is a schematic front view of a first 
embodiment of the device of this invention, 
mounted to a carriage which is slidably  
 
engaged on a vertical guide; Figure 2is a schematic side view of the device of

<CLAIMS>
A safety device for stopping the fall of a 
carriage (1) slidably mounted to non horizontal 

guides (3) and suspended by a series of tensile 
stressed sustaining members (2, 4), 

characterized in that it comprises means (5) 
capable of detecting a breaking occurring in 

said series of tensile stressed sustaining 
members (2, 4); said means (5) being mounted to 

the carriage (1) and operationally connected to 
locking means (8) fitted on the carriage and 

adjacent the guides (3); said locking means (8) 
being movable from a starting non-operational 

position close to the guides (3) to a final 
operational position in which the locking means 

(8) engage the guides (3), whereby the carriage 
(1) is stopped from falling. 
A device according to claim 1, characterised in 
that said locking means (8) consist of cams, 

hinged (12, 16) to the carriage. 
A device according to claim 1, characterised in 
that said means (5) capable of detecting a 

breaking occurring in said series of tensile 
stressed sustaining members consist of means for 

detecting tensile stress drops in said 
 

sustaining members (2, 4). 
A device according to claims 1 and 3, 
characterised in that said detecting means (5) 

comprise a plurality of compressed spring means 
that end to urge downward a plate (6, 17) 

suspended to said sustaining members (2, 4). 
A device according to claim 4, characterised in 
that said spring means (5) are adjusted so as to 

move said plate when the tensile stress in said 
series of sustaining members decreases beyond a 

predetermined value. 
A device according to claim 4, characterised in 
that the plate (6) is pivotally mounted (10) to 

the cams (8). 
A device according to claim 4, characterised in 
that it comprises hydraulic pistons (19) being

(17) being operationally connected to hydraulic 

piston actuating means (14). 
A device according to claim 1, characterised in 
that it comprises straining means (11) mounted 

to said series of sustaining members (2, 4) for 
keeping said members (2, 4) under tensile stress 

in normal operational conditions. 
A device according to claim 4, characterised in 
 

that one end of said sustaining members is a 
cable (2). one end of the cable being bound to a 

hooking seat (27) located on the carriage (1), 
whereby the cable (2) forms a closed ring around
