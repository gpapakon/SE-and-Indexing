<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to novel phosphonic acid derivatives having herbicidal 
activity, to processes and intermediates used in their preparation and to herbicidal 
compositions containing them. EP-A-0078613 describes certain triazole phosphonic acid derivatives and their use as 
herbicides. Copending Patent Applications WO92/19629 and EP-A-0528760 describe other 
such compounds. According to the present invention there is provided a herbicidal compound of 
formula (I) or a salt, tautomer or cyclic derivative thereof; wherein: 
R1 and R2 are hydrogen; R8 is fluorine, chlorine, bromine, iodine, 1,2,4-triazol-1-yl, cyano, nitrosyloxy, aminoxy, 
amino, azido, SCSOCH2CH2, SCOCH3, mercapto, methylthio, methanesulphonyl or 
methanesulphinyl; R9 is hydrogen or fluorine; or R9 together with R8 forms an oximino group; R10 is hydrogen, hydroxy or amino; or R9 and R10 together form: -O- R11 
is hydrogen; and R12 and R13 are each independently hydrogen, hydroxy or fluorine, with the proviso that 
when one of R12 and R13 is hydroxy, the other is hydrogen. As used herein the term "cyclic derivatives" refers to compounds derived from 
compounds of formula (I) where the group A is a saturated chain containing a leaving 
substituent at the 3-position. When the pH is raised so that the phosphonate group becomes 
dianionic, such compounds cyclise to form a compound of structure (IA) where Z+ is an 
cation of valency n. n is suitably 1, 2 or 3. Suitable leaving substituents include halogen, 
or nitrosyloxy. Compounds of formula (I) can exist in diastereoisomeric forms, geometric isomeric 
forms and optically active forms. The present invention includes all such forms and mixtures 
thereof in all proportions.  
 Preferably R8 is a leaving group such as nitrosyloxy, fluorine, chlorine, bromine or 
iodine to enable the cyclic derivative to form, or amino. According to another embodiment of the present invention there is provided a 
herbicidal compound of formula (I) or a salt or tautomer thereof. Suitable salts of formula (I) are agriculturally acceptable salts such as those formed 
with alkali metals, alkaline earth metals, ammonium, organic ammonium, 
trialkylsulphonium, trialkylsulphoxonium, phosphonium, and amidinium cations. The term 
organic ammonium cation is intended to include ammonium cations prepared from low 
molecular weight amines, that is to say those having a molecular weight below about 300. 
Examples of such amines include alkylamines, alkenylamines, and alkanolamines containing 
not more than two
