<ABSTRACT>
The present invention generally relates to a process of agglomerating particulate material in the presence of water which comprises mixing said particulate material with a binding effective amount of at least one water soluble polymer, and a binder enhancing effective amount of caustic, to produce a mixture, and forming said mixture into agglomerates. The invention also relates to a binder composition useful for the agglomeration of particulate material in the presence of water which comprises a binding effective amount of a water-soluble polymer and a binder enhancing effective amount of caustic.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a novel
process for agglomerating particulate materials containing iron.Agglomeration is commercially used in industries where
materials are encountered in a form which is too finely
divided for convenient processing or handling. Thus, there is
a need to upgrade the size, density and/or uniformity of
finely divided particles for more efficient handling,
processing or recovery. Agglomeration is particularly useful
in the metal refining industry, where the concentrate ore
encountered is typically finely divided.Many processes for the agglomeration of particles,
especially metallic particles, are known in the art. In the
mining industry it is common practice to agglomerate or
pelletize finely ground mineral ore concentrate to facilitate
shipping of the ore. After the mineral ore has been mined, it
is frequently wet ground, though not always the case, and
screened to remove large particles which can be recycled for
further grinding. The screened mineral ore is known in the
art as "concentrate".After screening, a binding agent is added to the wetted
mineral ore concentrate and the binder/mineral ore composite
is conveyed to a balling drum or other means for pelletizing
the ore. The binding agent serves to bold or bind the mineral
ore together until after firing. After the balling drum
operation, the pellets are formed, but they are still wet. 
These wet pellets are commonly referred to as "green pellets"
or "green balls". These green pellets are thereafter
transported to a kiln and heated in stages to an end
temperature of about 1316째C (2400째F).For many years, bentonite clay was the binding agent of
choice in the pelletizing operations for mineral ore
concentrates. Use of bentonite as a binding agent produces
balls or pellets having a very good wet and dry strength and
also provides a desired degree of moisture control. Use of
bentonite does, however, have several disadvantages.
Initially, bentonite adds to the silica content of the pellets
when the ore pellets are fired at a temperature of 1316째C (2400째F) or
higher. Higher amounts of silica are not desirable because
silica decreases the efficiency of blast furnace operations
used in smelting the ore.The use of bentonite to form pellets of mineral ore
concentrates can also add alkalis which are oxides of, for
example, sodium and potassium. The presence of alkalis in the
blast furnace causes both the pellets and coke to deteriorate
and to form scabs on the furnace wall, which increases fuel
consumption and decreases the
