<ABSTRACT>
A suspension aerosol formulation comprises a propellant 
selected from 1,1,1,2-tetrafluoroethane or 1,1,1,2,3,3,3-heptafluoropropane 

or mixtures thereof, a powdered medicament and 
perfluorinated surface-active dispersing agent.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to suspension aerosol
formulations suitable for the administration of
medicaments. More particularly, it relates to
pharmaceutical suspension aerosol formulations using
1,1,1,2-tetrafluoroethane or 1,1,1,2,3,3,3-heptafluoropropane
as the propellant.Pharmaceutical suspension aerosol formulations
currently use a mixture of liquid chlorofluorocarbons as
the propellant. Fluorotrichloromethane, dichlorodifluoromethane
and dichlorotetrafluoroethane are the most commonly
used propellants in aerosol formulations for administration
by inhalation.Chlorofluorocarbons have been implicated in the
destruction of the ozone layer and their production is
being phased out. Hydrofluorocarbon 134a (HFC-134a,
1,1,1,2-tetrafluoroethane) and hydrofluorocarbon 227
(HFC-227, 1,1,1,2,3,3,3,-heptafluoropropane) are viewed as
being more ozone friendly than many chlorofluorocarbon
propellants; furthermore, they have low toxicity and vapor
pressures suitable for use in aerosols.U.S. Pat. No. 4,352,789 discloses a self-propelling,
powder dispensing aerosol composition
comprising between 0.001 and 20 percent by weight of
a finely-divided solid material coated with a dry coating
of a perfluorinated surface-active dispersing agent of a
particular type which constitutes between 0.1 to 20
percent by weight of the coated solid and a halogenated
propellant. The solid material can be a medicament. The 
use of 1,1,1,2-tetrafluoroethane or 1,1,1,2,3,3,3-heptafluoropropane
as a propellant is not specifically
disclosed. Perfluorinated carboxylic acid surfactants are
not disclosed.This invention provides a suspension aerosol
formulation, comprising: a propellent comprising a
hydrofluorocarbon selected from the group consisting of
1,1,1,2-tetrafluoroethane and 1,1,1,2,3,3,3-heptafluoropropane
and a mixture thereof; a therapeutically
effective amount of a powdered medicament, and between
0.001 and 0.6 percent by weight based on the total weight
of said formulation of a perfluorinated surface-active
dispersing agent
comprising a perfluorinated carboxylic acid soluble in the
propellant;
the formulation exhibiting substantially
no crystallization of said medicament over a prolonged
period, being substantially readily redispersible, and upon
redispersion not flocculating so quickly as to prevent
reproducible dosing of the medicament. The pharmaceutical suspension aerosol
formulations of the invention are suitable, for example,
for dermal, pulmonary, or mucosal (e.g., buccal or nasal)
administration.The term "suspension aerosol"
