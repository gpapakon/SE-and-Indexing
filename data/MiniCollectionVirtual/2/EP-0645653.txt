<ABSTRACT>
A transmitter and a receiver element (2, 3) are arranged closely adjacent in such a manner that they have access to the same optical waveguide interface (4). This permits, in particular, the construction of a greatly simplified optical serial multimaster bus system with an optical star coupler and single-guide optical waveguide connections, on which standard autobus protocols can be implemented. On a substrate carrier (5), in particular a stamped metal systems carrier, there are closely arranged next to one another a luminescent diode (LED) (2) as transmitter element and a photodiode (3) as receiver element. The two diodes (2) and (3) are closely adjacent such that they have access to the same optical waveguide interface (4). All suitable electrooptical transducers can, in principle, be used as transmitter and receiver elements, a luminescent diode being, however, considerably more advantageous for the transmitter element than a laser diode, as otherwise the laser light incident on the other transmitter diodes can produce interference. In Figure 1, there are illustrated as further components arranged on the substrate carrier (5) an integrated circuit (6) and a discrete component, for example a capacitor (7), which are electrically connected to the transmitter and receiver elements (2) and (3) and form in conjunction therewith an evaluation circuit. The entire arrangement is provided with a housing (8) and forms a T/R module (1) into which the optical waveguide interface (4) is also integrated.
