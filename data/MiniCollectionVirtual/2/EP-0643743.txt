<ABSTRACT>
The present invention provides improved powder-free gloves having improved cleanliness as well as desired ergonomics over current natural rubber latex gloves. By controlling the formulation used to construct the gloves, a wide range of physical performance, aging resistance, as well as high cleanliness can be achieved. To this end, the present invention provides a powder-free glove constructed from a sequential copolymer. In an embodiment, the sequential copolymer is chosen from the group consisting of: poly(styrene-b-isoprene-b-styrene); poly(styrene-b-butadiene-b-styrene); poly(styrene-b-ethylene butylene-b-styrene); poly(styrene-b-ethylene propylene-b-styrene); radial and teleblock copolymers of the type (SI)x, (SB)x, and the like; and graft copolymers.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to thermoplastic
elastomer based powder-free gloves. More specifically,
the present invention relates to gloves for use in clean
rooms and for examination and surgical applications.It is known to use rubber and plastic gloves in
clean rooms. Clean rooms are used in a number of
industries including microelectronics, disc drives,
semiconductors, aerospace, pharmaceuticals, medical
devices, and biotechnology, to create controlled
environments. Typically, natural rubber and polyvinyl
chloride based gloves are used in these applications.
However, these gloves have certain disadvantages.Natural rubber based gloves contained surface as
well as extractable contaminants. Due to these
contaminants, it is difficult to meet the cleanliness
levels required for many ultraclean environments.
Likewise, polyvinyl chloride based gloves have certain
disadvantages including the fact that the plasticizers
typically used in polyvinyl chloride are detrimental in
many clean room environments. In this regard, it should
be noted that clean rooms are concerned with respect to
many contaminants. Such contaminants include, ions,
metals, nonvolatile residues, and other compounds.A further disadvantage with many known thermoplastic
gloves is that they are prepared by dipping a mold in a
solution of the compound. See, for example, U.S. Patent
No. 3,933,723. The solution is prepared by dissolving
the compound in a solvent, e.g., toluene. Such solvents
create problems with respect to environmental issues. BE-852480 relates to gloves formed of elastomeric material
including compounding ingredients and with particulate material embedded
in and randomly distributed in an inner layer. EP-A-488021 relates to
manufacture of articles, inter alia gloves, from elastomeric compositions
comprising at least two S-EB-S block copolymers and a compounding
ingredient, namely a plasticizer FR-A-2333019 relates to compositions
which may be used, inter alia, for gloves comprising blends of block
copolymers including a hydrogenated polymer block of a conjugated diene
and compounding ingredients including a hydrocarbon oil and a finely
divided filler Thermoplastic polyurethane clean room gloves have
been explored. These gloves, however, are very expensive
when compared to typical natural rubber clean room
gloves. Still further, a disadvantage with these gloves
is that they do not provide the latex-like
characteristics that are desirable, especially ergonomics
and fit. For example, due to the high modulus of many
plastics and
