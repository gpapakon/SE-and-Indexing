<ABSTRACT>
A power transistor module comprises: a pair of power transistor chips (Tr1, Tr2) mounted on a
circuit substrate and connected in antiparallel to free-wheel diodes (D1, D2); circuit pattern (3)

comprising first emitter, collector and gate pattern parts for connection to the emitter, the
collector and the gate electrode, respectively, of the first transistor chip (Tr1), and second

emitter, collector and gate pattern parts for connection to the emitter, collector and gate
electrode, respectively, of the second transistor chip (Tr1); an internal connection pattern part

integrally connecting the first emitter pattern part (3e) and the second collector pattern part (3b)
so as to form the upper and lower arms of a bridge circuit; first (C1), second (C2E1) and third

(E2) output terminals connected to the first collector, the second collector and the second
emitter pattern parts (3c), respectively, and first and second gate terminals (G1, G2) connected

to the first and second gate pattern parts, respectively; and first and second auxiliary terminals

(e1, e2) connected to the pattern parts to which said second and third output terminals (C2E1,
E2) are connected. The first emitter pattern parts (3e, 3c) form inductance regions and are

divided by a slit so as to form a hairpin like structure with first and second legs. The first leg of
the first emitter pattern part (3e) is connected to the emitter electrode of the first transistor chip

(Tr1) and the second leg is connected to the first auxiliary terminal, said internal connection
pattern part connecting the free end of the second leg to the second collector pattern part (3b).

By this structure a surge generated at the time of the switching operation is suppressed, while
at the same time, a balance is obtained in the switching characteristics between the upper and

lower arms of the bridge when the internal wiring inductance l1 (
l1 = l2
) is adjusted to have an
appropriate value.
