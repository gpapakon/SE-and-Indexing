<ABSTRACT>
Door-locking device for electrical switchgear or other dangerous apparatus located behind the door. The inaccurate insertion of a key element (40) into the insertion channel (61) of a safety switch (60) is avoided by placing the locking bolt (1) in the immediate vicinity of the centre of rotation (X) of the door lock. The advantage of this position, that the warping effects of the switch-cabinet door are at their lowest here, is utilised. With the interlocking of the key element (40), its locking element (11) is interlocked at the same time. It is consequently impossible, despite an activated locking mechanism, to actuate the rotary-fastening device (53) of the cabinet door.

<CLAIMS>
A device for bolting a door with the following 
characteristics:
a rotary door lock which is arranged on a door (51) on the middle of the 
sideopposite its axis of rotation, and which substantially comprises an 

outwards facing rotary locking device (53) and a locking bolt (1) non-positively 
connected to it, which faces inwards and fastens into a rear grip (52) on 

the door frame (50) or such like when the door is in a closed position; 
the locking bolt (1) comprises a metal plate bent at 90°, which is designed in 
such a way that its shorter leg is an L-shaped, substantially flat closing 

element (11) and its longer leg (12) is an angled piece (12), in which the 
angled piece (12) is bent at a distance (Y) from the axis (X) of the locking 

bolt (1) at 90° to it and has at its free end a tab (15) bent at 90° in the opposite 
direction to the closing element (11); 
a guide element (30) is arranged flush to the tab (15), in which a key element 
(40) is movably supported; 
a safety switch (60), which has a door monitoring and a door bolting 
function, which is arranged on the door frame (50) or such like and which is 

capable of being brought into or out of connection with the key element (40) 
when the door (51) is closed by use of the rotary locking device (53); 
the key element (40) is functionally connected with a mechanically or magnetically 
operated locking catch within the safety switch (60) to prevent 

withdrawal or to release. 
A device according to claim 1, 
in which
 the guide element (30) comprises a 
guide frame (31) which has a first borehole in the centre of its upper surface and 

a second borehole in the centre of its supporting surface, through which a hollow 
rivet (70) or suchlike is passed, which passes through a further borehole in the 

angled piece (12) and serves to fasten the guide frame (31).  
 
A device according to claim 1 or 2, 
in which
 the hollow rivet (70) or suchlike grips 
through an aperture (41) in the key element (40) which is supported in the guide 

frame (31), whereby the internal diameter of the aperture (41) is larger than the 
external diameter of the hollow rivet (70) or suchlike. 
A device according to one of the claims 1 to 3, 
in which
 the angled piece (12) 
has a first projection (13), which supports the first end (32a) of a compres
sion 
spring (32) which grips round a centering stud (33), and that the second end 

(32b) of the compression spring (32) grips round a shaped and bent nose (42) on 
the rear side of the key element (40), whereby a spring pressure force is realized 

which holds the key element (40) in a permanently pretensioned state. 
A device according to claim 4, 
in which
 the spring pressure force forces the key 
element (40) into the maximal possible angle of inclination (a) to the plane of the 

angled piece (12). 
A device according to claim 5, 
in which
 the angle of inclination (a) is limited by 
centering bushes (34, 34a) arranged within the guide frame (31). 
A device according to claim 5 oder 6, 
in which
 the angled piece (12) has a 
second projection (14) in the same plane as the first projection (13), through 

which projects an adjustment element (35) for the angle of inclination (a), which 
supports the key element (40) against the spring pressure of the compression 

spring (32). 
A device according to one of the previous claims, 
in which
 a further aperture (44) 
is provided in the key element (40) which works together with the locking catch. 
A device according to one of the previous claims, 
in which
 the closing element 
(11) is provided with a closing plate (16) on the end side.  

 
A device according to claim 1, 8 oder 9, 
in which
 the location of the axis (X) of 
the rotary locking device (53) is so chosen, that during the unlocking process, 

after the key element (40) has been released, it is withdrawn from the safety 
switch (60) before the closing element (11) comes out of connection with the rear 

grip (52).
