<ABSTRACT>
In the case of a thermally insulated pipe having a plastics inner pipe (1), an outer pipe (2, 10) and an insulating layer (3) of expanded polyurethane between inner pipe (1) and outer pipe (2, 10), the insulating layer (3) consists of foam expanded by CO2 or by partly halogenated hydrocarbon. The inner pipe (1) is mechanically interlocked with the insulating layer (3). The outer pipe (2, 10) is likewise mechanically interlocked with the insulating layer (3) on account of a surface texturing.

Heat-insulated line pipe, comprising an inner 
pipe of plastic, an outer pipe arranged concentrically at 

a distance therefrom and an insulating layer of foamed 
plastic, based on polyurethane, filling the annular space 

between the inner pipe and the outer pipe, characterized 
by the following features: 


a) the insulating layer (3) consists of CO
2
-blown 
polyurethane foam or a polyurethane foam blown with 

partly halogenated hydrocarbon, 
b) the inner pipe (1) is textured on its outer surface 
in such a way that a mechanical interlocking with 

the insulating layer (3) occurs and 
c) the outer pipe is a corrugated pipe (10), the corrugation 
of which is at least partially filled by the 

insulating layer (3) or a smooth plastic pipe (2), 
the inner surface of which is textured, so that a 

mechanical interlocking with the insulating layer 
(3) occurs. 
Heat-insulated line pipe according to Claim 1, 
characterized in that the outer pipe is a corrugated 

plastic pipe (10). 
Heat-insulated line pipe according to Claim 1 or 
2, characterized in that the inner pipe (1) is a corrugated 

plastic pipe. 
Heat-insulated line pipe according to one of 
Claims 1 to 3, characterized in that the inner pipe (1) 

is roughened on its outer surface. 
Heat-insulated line pipe according to one of 
Claims 1 to 4, characterized in that grooves running in 

the circumferential direction or helically are formed in  
 

the surface of the inner pipe (1). 
Heat-insulated line pipe according to one of 
Claims 1 to 5, characterized in that one or more layers 

of a material in strand form, such as for example a tape 
(4), a cord, are wound up onto the inner pipe (1). 
Heat-insulated line pipe according to Claim 6, 
characterized in that two layers are wound up crosswise. 
Heat-insulated line pipe according to one of 
Claims 1 to 7, characterized in that a tape (4) having 

outwardly directed elevations (5), for example a studded 
tape, is wound up onto the inner pipe (1). 
Heat-insulated line pipe according to one of 
Claims 6 to 8, characterized in that the layers of the 

material in strand form or tape (4) are adhesively bonded 
to the outer surface of the inner pipe (1). 
Heat-insulated line pipe according to one of 
Claims 1 to 9, characterized in that one or more films 

(4) made of material which is diffusion-resistant to 
oxygen and/or carbon dioxide and/or water vapour are 

applied to the inner pipe (1). 
Heat-insulated line pipe according to one of 
Claims 1 to 10, characterized in that one or more profilings 

of thermoplastic material, running in the circumferential 
direction helically or with alternating direction, 

are extruded onto the inner pipe (1). 
Heat-insulated line pipe according to Claim 11, 
characterized in that the profiling comprises strips of 

hot-melt adhesive which are applied with alternating 
direction. 
Heat-insulated line pipe according to Claim 6 or 
one of the following claims, characterized in that the 

inner pipe (1) is wound with one or more layers of 
plastic tape which is reinforced by strands of glass 

fibres or a similar tension-resistant material running in 
the longitudinal direction of the tape. 
Heat-insulated line pipe according to one of 
Claims 1 to 13, characterized in that the inner pipe (1) 

consists of crosslinked polyethylene. 
Heat-insulated line pipe according to one of  
 

Claims 1 to 14, characterized in that the insulating 
layer (3) is surrounded by a film (6) which is adhesively 

bonded both to the insulating layer (3) and to the outer 
pipe (2). 
Heat-insulated line pipe according to one of 
Claims 1 to 15, characterized in that there is provided 

between the insulating layer (3) and the plastic outer 
pipe (2) a metal foil (6) which is provided with inwardly 

protruding studs (7) and is adhesively bonded to the 
outer pipe (2). 
Heat-insulated line pipe according to one of 
Claims 1 to 16, characterized in that the annular space 

between the inner pipe (1) and the outer pipe (2) is 
sealed off by a heat-shrunk sleeve (8), having a metallic 

insert, resting on the outer pipe (2) and the inner pipe 
(1) or an element (9) extending the inner pipe (1).
