<ABSTRACT>
Disclosed are methods and compositions for the identification, characterization and inhibition of mammalian farnesyl protein transferases, enzymes involved in the farnesylation of various cellular proteins, including cancer related (ras) proteins such as p21ras. The nucleotide and amino acid sequences of the (alpha) and (beta) subunits of both rat and human farnesyl transferase are disclosed, as are methods and compositions for the preparation of farnesyl transferase by recombinant means, following the molecular cloning and co-expression of its two subunits, for assay and purification of the enzyme, as well as procedures for using the purified enzyme in screening protocols for the identification of possible anticancer agents which inhibit the enzyme and thereby prevent expression of proteins such as p21ras. Also disclosed is a family of compounds which act either as false substrates for the enzyme or as pure inhibitors and can therefore be employed for inhibition of the enzyme. The most potent inhibitors are ones in which phenylalanine occurs at the third position of a tetrapeptide whose amino terminus is cysteine. Improved inhibitors with defined structures and characteristics are also disclosed.

 DESCRIPTIONMETHODS AND COMPOSITIONS FOR THEIDENTIFICATION. CHARACTERIZATION, ANDINHIBITION OF FARNESYLTRANSFERASEBACKGROUND OF THE INVENTIONThe present application is a continuation-in-part of co-pending U.S. Serial Number 07/935,087, filed August24, 1992; which is a continuation-in-part of U.S. Serial Number 07/822,011, filed January 16, 1992; which is a continuation-in-part of PCT application, US 91/02650, filed April 18, 1991; which is a continuation-in-part of U.S. Serial Number 07/615,715, filed November 20, 1990, and which issued as U.S patent 5,141,851 on August 25, 1992; and which itself is a continuation-in-part of U.S. Serial Number 07/510,706, filed April 18, 1990. The U.S. Government may own certain rights in the present invention pursuant to NIH grant number 5-PO1-HL20948.1. Field of the InventionThis invention relates generally to improved peptide-based inhibitors of farnesyltransferase, the enzyme responsible for the farnesylation of p21rÏŠ protein, and more particularly relates to peptide-based "pure" inhibitors having improved characteristics and structures. Improvements are based on the inventors' discovery of structural characteristics that ensure that a peptide inhibitor will exhibit "pure" inhibitor characteristics, which provide important guidelines for inhibitor design that will allow cellular uptake while preserving inhibitory capabilitites. 

2. Description of the Related ArtIn recent years, some progress has been made in the elucidation of cellular events lending to the development or progression of various types of cancers. A .great amount of research has centered on identifying genes which are altered or mutated in cancer relative to normal cells. In fact, genetic research has led to the identification of a variety of gene families in which mutations can lead to the development of a wide variety of tumors. The ras gene family is a family of closely related genes that frequently contain mutations involved in many human tumors, including tumors of virtually every tumor group (see, e.g., Bos, 1989) . In fact, altered ras genes are the most frequently identified oncogenes in human tumors (Barbacid, 1987) .The ras gene family comprises three genes, H-ras, K-ras and N-ras, which encode similar proteins with molecular weights of about 21,000 (Barbacid, 1987) .These proteins, often termed p21ras, comprise a family of GTP-binding and hydrolyzing proteins that regulate cell growth when bound to the inner surface of the plasma membrane (Hancock, et al . , 1989; Scheler et al . , 1989) .
