<ABSTRACT>
A fuse holder for a fuse link which is constructed such that it can be plugged in has a supporting part which is constructed in the form of a housing (4) and bounds an elongated chamber (10) which contains a pair of contact points for the fuse link, is open at the top and is bounded at the ends by housing parts (12) which contain insulation-piercing terminal contacts (11). When the fuse link is inserted, the chamber can be at least partially closed by a detachable closure part which is fitted with retaining means for the fuse link.
