<ABSTRACT>
A dental hygiene device for cleaning enlarged embrasures includes a
brush (14) having a plurality of bristles (18) projecting from a rigid spine (28)

opposed ends of which are secured to lengths of flexible filaments (34, 36)
such as dental floss. A free end of at least one of the filaments maybe

provided with a stiff pin-like (44) useful as a toothpick or in threading the
device through gaps between teeth or orthodontic structures.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to dental hygiene devices which are especially
useful for cleaning those portions of teeth, dental prosthesis, or orthodontic
work lying adjacent spaces or gaps such as enlarged gaps between neighboring
teeth. More particularly the present invention relates to dental hygiene devices
including a relatively small diameter brush having short bristles extending from
a rigid central spine each end of which is attached to a length of flexible
filament such as dental floss or dental tape.In addition to regular dental checkups and periodic professional cleaning
of the teeth to remove plaque, a regular personal regimen of dental hygiene is
essential to maintaining the health and appearance of the teeth and gums. The
use of a manual toothbrush having an array of bristles mounted near one end of 
some form of handle is the most familiar and commonly-used implement for this
purpose. Also known are various forms of mechanized brushing devices in
which energy in various forms are imparted to the bristles in various other ways
including electro-mechanical drives which cause tufts of bristles to rotate either
unidirectionally or biodirectionally in an oscillatory fashion. Toothbrushes in
which ultrasonic energy is imparted to bristles are also known in the art. The
foregoing types of toothbrushes can usually be selected from a range of bristle
stiffness ranging from relatively stiff or "hard" to relatively compliant or "soft".Toothbrushes of the types described above are effective for cleaning most
areas of the teeth, dental prosthesis, and orthodontic appliances but have
significant limitations. These limitations stem mainly for the need of these
devices for some form of a relatively long and rigid or semi-rigid handle and
the fact that bristles, by their nature, clean most effectively when they extend
substantially perpendicularly to the surface being cleaned. Given the positioning
and movement constraints imposed by using devices having such handles within
the confines of a human mouth, it is simply not possible to position the brush
and move its bristles so that maximally effective cleaning can be realized over
all areas of the teeth, dental work and gums. These disadvantages have been
ameliorated somewhat by various improvements directed toward improving the
maneuverability of toothbrush heads such as making the heads smaller, angling
the brush handle, providing a flexible joint in the handle and arranging bristles
of varying lengths to form tufts having special contours intended to improve

<CLAIMS>
A dental hygiene device comprising a brush (14) having a spine (28)
having opposed ends and a plurality of bristles (18) each having a base

portion (24) secured to the spine (28), and two flexible filaments (24,
26), one attached to each said opposed end of the spine (28),


characterised in that
 the spine (28) is substantially more rigid than the
bristles (18).
A dental hygiene device as claimed in Claim 1 wherein each filament is
a filament (24, 26) of dental floss.
A dental hygiene device as claimed in any preceding claim wherein at
least one filament (34, 36) includes a free end terminating in a stiff tip

(44).
A dental hygiene device as claimed in any preceding claim wherein the
bristles (18) are disposed in a helical array about the spine (28).
A dental hygiene device as claimed in any preceding claim wherein the
bristles (18) decrease in length to form a generally conical taper

adjacent at least one of the opposed ends of the spine (28).
