<ABSTRACT>
A compound optical waveguide device which is of a 
reduced size has an optical waveguide chip (10), a 

photodiode (50), and a laser diode (70). The optical 
waveguide chip has a substrate of LiNbO₃ (12), a Y-shaped 

optical waveguide (16), a phase modulator (24), 
and a polariser (28). The substrate has an end face 

(32) inclined at 70° with respect to the optical axis of 
the Y-shaped optical waveguide. A photodiode is fixedly 

mounted on the substrate. A portion of light propagated 
through the Y-shaped optical waveguide is reflected by 

the inclined end face to enter the photodiode. Light 
emitted from the laser diode enters the Y-shaped optical 

waveguide through the inclined end face.Use in laser fiber gyros or 
multiplexers.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a compound
optical waveguide device, and more particularly to a
compound optical waveguide device for use in an optical
fiber gyro or an optical transmission system.Optical systems used in conventional optical fiber
gyro devices include an optical fiber system composed entirely
of optical fibers and an optical system composed of
an optical waveguide substrate on which a polarizer and a Y-shaped
optical waveguide are disposed.FIG. 1 of the accompanying drawings shows in perspective
a conventional compound optical waveguide device
200 for use in an optical fiber gyro.As shown in FIG. 1, the compound optical waveguide
device 200 generally has an optical waveguide chip 10, an
optical fiber loop 90, an optical fiber coupler 606, a laser
diode 612 and photodiode 614.The optical waveguide chip 10 comprises a
substrate 12 of LiNbO3, a Y-shaped optical waveguide 16, a
phase modulator 24, and a polarizer 28 which are disposed on
an upper surface 14 of the substrate 12. The Y-shaped
optical waveguide 16 is composed of an optical waveguide 18
and two optical waveguides 20, 22 branched from the optical 
waveguide 18. The optical fiber coupler 606 is composed of
two optical fibers 602, 604 fused to each other, and the
optical waveguide 18 has an end connected to the optical
fiber 602 of the optical fiber coupler 606. The optical
waveguides 20, 22 are connected respectively to optical
fibers 92, 94 on the opposite ends of the optical fiber loop
90. The phase modulator 24 comprises a pair of electrodes
26 disposed one on each side of the optical waveguide 20.The conventional compound optical waveguide device
200 is of a relatively small size as it employs the optical
waveguide chip 10 in which the Y-shaped optical waveguide
16, the phase modulator 24, and the polarizer 28 are
integrated on the substrate 12. However, the optical
coupler 606 cannot be reduced in length as it is composed of
the two fused optical fibers 602, 604. Furthermore, the
entire compound optical waveguide device 200 is relatively
long because the optical waveguide chip 10, the optical
coupler 606, the laser diode 612, and the photodiode 614 are
arranged in a linear array.Widespread realization of a subscriber-based
system for use in optical-transmission CATV and B-ISDN
systems requires that economical and small-size optical
components be available for use in an optical transmission
system. There have been made research and development
efforts for producing optical waveguide devices which allow
individual optical
