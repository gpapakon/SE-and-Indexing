<ABSTRACT>
For simplification of known column kits for the anti-tip security fixation of two superposed household machines 1 and 3, it is proposed that the kit contain four simple foot plates 6 in exchange for the standing feet, a device 7 to 10, 12 and 13 for securing the rear bottom edge of the machine 3 mounted on top against lifting off from the worktop 2 and an arrangement 11, 14 to 17 for securing the front bottom edge of the machine 3 mounted on top against movements in the direction of the front side of the machines. On the one hand, the housings of the superposed machines are thereby located so close one above the other that front and side panels for concealing the gap between the worktop 2 and the housing of the machine 3 mounted on top can thus be dispensed with, and on the other hand the kit is reduced to a minimum in terms of the parts required. The assembly of such a kit is thus simplified to such a degree that technically inexperienced people are able to carry out the assembly independently.

Construction kit for the tilt-free connection of two domestic appliances placed one
above the other, in particular a washing machine and a dryer, into a washer-dryer column,

of which the lower machine (1) comprises a worktop (2) and the surmounted machine (3)
comprises a housing casing (4) and four support feet with threaded shanks and foot plates

which are threadable into a base plate for purposes of the height adjustment,
characterised in that it contains four unthreaded single foot plates (6), which are provided

for exchange against the support feet, a rear side retention (7 to 10, 12, 13), which is
mountable at the rear edge of the surmounted machine and at the rear upper edge of the

machine standing below, for fixing the surmounted machine (3) against lifting-off from the
worktop (2) and a front side retention (11, 14 to 17), which is mountable at the front base

edge of the surmounted machine and at the front upper edge of the machine standing
below and serves for fixing the surmounted machine (3) against movements in the

direction of the front sides of the machines (1, 3).
Construction kit according to claim 1, characterised in that each single foot plate (6)
comprises a shank (18) with detent elements (20, 21), which on the introduction into the

threaded holes of the base plate in place of the threadable support feet detent into a
thread course.
Construction kit according to claim 1 or 2, characterised in that the rear side
retention contains two bracket-shaped holders (9) with spigot holes (12) in the upright limb

and with screw holes in the limb lying against the worktop (2), two spigots (7) with co-axial
screw holes, two threaded plates (10) as countersupports at the location of the holders (9)

below the worktop (2) as well as four screws (13) for the fastening of the holders (9) with
the threaded plates (10) at the worktop (2) and two self-tapping screws (8) or sheet-metal

screws for fastening the spigots (7) at the rear wall of the surmounted machine (3) at the
height of the spigot holes (12).
Construction kit according to one of the claims 1 to 3, characterised in that the front
side retention contains a front side bracket (11 ) with at least two screw holes in each limb

(15, 16) as well as at least two chipboard screws (14) for fastening the bracket (11) on the
worktop (2) and at least two self-tapping screws (17) or sheet-metal screws for fastening 

the upright bracket limb (16) at the front side of the body (4) of the surmounted machine
(3).
Construction kit according to claim 4, characterised in that a template is provided,
which is matched to the size of the worktop (2) and designates the exact position of the

screw holes for the assembly of the equipment (7 to 10, 12, 13) and the arrangement (11,
14 to 17) at the worktop (2).
Construction kit according to claim 5, characterised in that the template displays
two drawing fields which, after laying of the template against the rear wall, designate the

position of the screw holes for the assembly of the spigots (7) at the surmounted machine
(3) and which, after laying of the template against the front side of the body, designate the

position of the screw holes for the fastening of the upright limb (16) of the front side
bracket (11).
