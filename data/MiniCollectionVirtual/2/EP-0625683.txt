<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a gas refrigerator,
especially to a pulse tube refrigerator.In order to produce cold in a pulse tube by gas
expansion, it is necessary to cause time-phase displacement
in the pressure of vibrating gas and the change of gas
volume. Therefore, an orifice type pulse tube refrigerator,
as is known in the art, includes mainly a high pressure gas
inlet valve, a low pressure gas outlet valve, a regenerator,
a cooler, a refrigeration power heat exchanger, a gas
smoother, an orifice, which forms phase displacement, and a
reservoir system. Such an orifice and a reservoir system are
connected to a hot end of a pulse tube thereof. The expansion
work is released as heat to the outside by tha throttling
process of the orifice, which provides the pulse tube with a
refrigeration effect. If such a irreversible loss is not
produced at the hot end of the pulse tube, the pulse tube does
not generate the refrigeration effect. However, the gross
refrigeration power per unit mass flow in the pulse tube is
very low, which causes theoretically very low efficiency. US 5 107 683 discloses a multistage pulse tube cooler.
Connected to the hot end of each pulse tube is a reservoir
so that heat from each successively lower temperature pulse
tube cooler is rejected into a heat sink other than the
preceding higher temperature pulse tube cooler.The present invention provides a pulse tube refrigerator
comprising a pulse tube, gas smoothers and, in
communication with the cold end of the pulse tube, a high
pressure inlet gas valve and a low pressure inlet gas
valve. The valves can communicate with the cold end of the
pulse tube. In communication with the hot end of the pulse
tube are provided a high pressure reservoir and a low
pressure reservoir, connected to the pulse tube via two
direction valves or a single directional control valve.
The directional control valve can be a rotary valve, a two
position three pass valve, an electric operated valve, an
electromagnetic valve, a pneumatic valve, or a multi-position
multi-pass electric operated rotary valve.The present invention further provides a rotary pulse tube
refrigerator comprising pulse tubes located around the
circumference of a pulse tube frame. A high pressure gas
inlet and a low pressure gas outlet are provided on a
rotatable valve core at the cold end of the pulse tubes at
the same circumference as the pulse tubes and which can
communicate with the cold ends. A moving seal is
maintained between the ends of the pulse tube frame and the
valve core. A gas
