<ABSTRACT>
In an air-curtain apparatus for doors, two circulating-air currents (14,15) rotating in opposite directions are produced with the aid of two blower devices (7,8). The direction of rotation of the two circulating-air currents (14,15) is chosen so that an upwardly directed air flow arises between the two circulating-air currents (14,15). This results in air which penetrates from outside being able to pass into the room interior (1) only via one of the blower devices (8) and thus being adequately conditioned.

Arrangement for producing an air curtain on a door or a doorway (5, 26)
of a room (1),


with a first fan arrangement (7) which is disposed above the door or the doorway
(5, 26),


has at least one air outlet (9) adjacent to the door or the doorway (5, 26),
has at least one air inlet (11) positioned nearer to the interior of the room
relative to the air outlet (9), and
from the air outlet (9) of which an air stream (16) emerges which is
directed downwards from above, is deflected upwards from the floor (2)

to the fan arrangement (7) and at least part of it is drawn into the air inlet
(11) in such a way that a first air roll (14) is produced of which the

upwardly streaming part (18) is remote from the door or the doorway (5,
26),
with a second fan arrangement (8) which has at least one air outlet (12) directed
towards the floor (2) and at least one air inlet (13),


and which lies further into the interior of the room relative to the first fan
arrangement (7), and 
is oriented in such a way that its air inlet (13) is adjacent to the air inlet
(11) of the first fan arrangement (7) in order to produce an air roll (15)

which has a direction of rotation opposite to that of the first air roll (14),
the rising air flow (18, 22) occurring between the air rolls (14, 15),

characterised in that only the second fan arrangement (8) has an air conditioning
arrangement (43) which is disposed between its air inlet (13) and its air outlet

(12) in terms of the flow and with the aid of which the air flowing from the air
inlet (13) to the air outlet (12) can be adjusted with regard to the temperature

and/or humidity values.
Arrangement as claimed in Claim 1, characterised in that both fan
arrangements (7, 8) are accommodated in their own housings (31) which are

separate from one another.
Arrangement as claimed in Claim 1, characterised in that the first and the
second fan arrangement (7, 8) are spaced from one another.
Arrangement as claimed in Claim 1, characterised in that both fan
arrangements (7, 8) are accommodated in a common housing.
Arrangement as claimed in Claim 1, characterised in that the air inlet (11)
of the first fan arrangement (7) and the air inlet (13) of the second fan

arrangement (8) are combined into one common air inlet. 
Arrangement as claimed in Claim 1, characterised in that a plurality of
first and second fan arrangements (7, 8) are disposed adjacent to one another

along the width of the door or the doorway (5, 26).
Arrangement as claimed in Claim 1, characterised in that the first and the
second fan arrangement (7, 8) are optionally of identical construction up to an air

conditioning arrangement (43).
Arrangement as claimed in Claim 1, characterised in that the first and/or
the second fan arrangement (7, 8) comprises a secondary air fan (48) for

producing an induction air jet as well as a primary air fan (42) which produces
an air stream with a large volume and a slower speed than the secondary air fan

(49).
Arrangement as claimed in Claim 8, characterised in that the secondary air
fan (49) has at least one ejector nozzle (51) which belongs to the air outlet (9,

12).
Arrangement as claimed in Claim 1, characterised in that the first and/or
the second fan arrangement (7, 8) contains its own fan, these fans being

optionally adjustable independently of one another.
Arrangement as claimed in Claim 1, characterised in that the first and/or
the second fan arrangement (7, 8) contains its own air guide arrangements which

are substantially independent of one another. 
Arrangement as claimed in Claim 1, characterised in that the first and the
second fan arrangement (7, 8) are substantially independent of one another in

aerodynamic terms.
Arrangement as claimed in Claim 1, characterised in that the air
conditioning arrangement (43) is merely a heating arrangement.
