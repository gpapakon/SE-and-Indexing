<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention refers to a receiver of television signals
comprising a teletext signals decoder of the type known as TOP,
and a command device equipped with a subtitles key.It is known that in various European countries, from among which
Italy, systems are in use (generally known with the English word
"teletext", and more specifically named "Televideo" in Italy and
"Videotext" in Germany) that allow for the transmission,
together with the normal television signals, of additional
information, inserted in the video signal (under the form of
coded digital signals) in several of the horizontal lines that
are free during the vertical return period.Such coded signals, upon a command by the user, are detected by
an appropriate decoding circuit, known and generally realised by
means of monolithic integrated circuits, inserted in the
circuits of the television set, so as to allow the display on 
the television screen of one of the transmitted information
pages, containing text or graphics.The number of pages normally transmitted are of several hundred,
grouped by subject (for example: latest news: pages 110-125,
sport: pages 150-162, politics: pages 210-222, games: pages 315-345,
etc); the first page (page 100) usually contains the
general subject index, and in the successive pages the sub-indexes
for each subject, with the relative page numbers. The
user has to, each time it is desired to receive a determined
page, input a sequence using three numbered keys so as to form
the three digit number of the searched page; the decoder begins
to receive the pages as they are transmitted, one after the
other, by the broadcaster; as soon as the page distinguished by
the sequence of digits inputted by the user is transmitted, the
decoder provides for its acquisition.The teletext system has various drawbacks: one of the main ones
is represented by the amount of time that one has to wait; for
reducing such drawback some variants to the system have been
proposed (TOP, FLOF, TOPLESS).In the system known as TOP
see also EP 0 468 447 A2
a key is also present that allows
direct access to the page of subtitles, i.e. the page that
contains the texts, that can be made to appear in
superimposition on the received television image; as an aid to
the user; for example the texts can contain a translation in a
different language, or represent an aid for the hard of hearing.
From EP 0 264 565 A2 it is known to receive, and to select
marked pages in the TOP table by use of a specific memory
device.However the subtitled pages are
