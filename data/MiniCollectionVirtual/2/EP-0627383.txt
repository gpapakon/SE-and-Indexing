<ABSTRACT>
The present invention relates to a process for preparing a crystalline sodium sheet (layer) silicate having a kanemite structure of the chemical formula  NaH Si2O5 . X H2O where X has a value between 1 and 3, which is characterised in that sodium disilicate, silica and water are mixed in a molar ratio of 1:2:(6-8) and are held at a temperature of from 20 to 100@C for a period of from 0.2 to 10 hours.
