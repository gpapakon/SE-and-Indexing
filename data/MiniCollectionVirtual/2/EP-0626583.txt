<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a method, usable in diverse ways, for determining periodic structures in a digitised amplitude spectrum, for example a Doppler spectrum of a radar echo. In this case, with the aid of fuzzy set theory, a residual spectrum is formed and the desired periodic structure in the original spectrum is determined at each (residual) spectral line present in the residual spectrum by making a histogram. The method is, in particular, usable for recognising aircraft, for example helicopters having periodically moving components, for example rotors, which generate a periodic structure in a (Doppler) spectrum.

Method for determining a cyclic structure in a
line spectrum, in which a spectral reference line

and a number of spectral lines which are adjacent
to it and are produced by a cyclic modulation

process are present, with

first of all, one spectral line being selected,
further spectral lines which are associated
with this spectral line and are arranged

cyclically in the line spectrum being
determined, and
the modulation parameters associated with the
modulation process being determined from the

cyclic structure of the line spectrum

determined in such a manner,
characterized
in that an amplitude spectrum, which is in
digital form, is first of all formed by means

of a digital sampling process and a Fourier
transformation from an input signal which is in

analogue form,
in that a predetermined number of adjacent
spectral lines in the amplitude spectrum are in

each case combined to form an interval,
in that, in each interval, the mean value of
the amplitudes of the spectral lines which are

present in this interval is determined,
in that, in each interval, each spectral line
which is present there is normalized in terms 

of its amplitude and in terms of the mean value
of the amplitudes associated with that

interval,
in that the normalized amplitudes (A
n
) are
subdivided into a number of overlapping

amplitude classes (IG, GG, G, SG, UG),
in that a cyclic supplement is looked for at
least in the vicinity of the reference line

relating to each spectral line which is present
there, so that a pair of lines is produced

which comprise the spectral line and a
continuation line,
in that each pair of lines is allocated to a
relevance class as a function of a combination,

which can be predetermined, of its normalized
amplitude classes,
in that each relevance class is allocated a
relevance value range which can be

predetermined,
in that a relevance value is determined for
each pair of lines,
in that the maximum relevance value of all the
pairs of lines associated with one spectral

line is determined and is allocated to that
spectral line,
in that a residual spectrum is formed from
spectral lines whose relevance value is greater

than a threshold value which can be
predetermined,
in that the number of associated continuation
lines is determined for each spectral line of

the residual spectrum in the digitized original
spectrum by histogram formation,
in that the spectral line having the maximum
number of continuation lines is determined from

the histogram, and
in that the modulation frequency is established
from the frequency separation between this

spectral line and the reference line.
Method according to Claim 1, characterized in
that, first of all, a number (n) which can be

predetermined, of spectral lines in the amplitude
spectrum which is present in digital form are in

each case combined to form a single spectral line,
and in that the single spectral line is allocated

the maximum value of the amplitudes of the
combined spectral lines as its amplitude value.
Method according to Claim 1 or Claim 2,
characterized in that the amplitude spectrum which

is in digital form has a frequency resolution
which is considerably smaller than the period of

the modulation frequency to be determined, and in
that the amplitude spectrum is specified on a

linear scale.
Method according to one of the preceding claims,
characterized in that the amplitude classes

associated with the linear amplitude spectrum,
and/or the relevance classes, have an association

function which has a linear profile in the
transitional region.
Method according to one of the preceding claims,
characterized in that the two amplitude classes

which are associated with one pair of lines are
combined using an AND operator, and the result of

the combination process is allocated a relevance
class which can be predetermined.
Method according to one of the preceding claims,
characterized in that the cyclic structure is

determined using a data processing system which
operates using fuzzy-set-theory methods.
Method according to one of the preceding claims,
characterized in that the amplitude values are 

weighted in the digitized original spectrum for
those spectral lines which are to be formed into a

histogram.
Method according to one of the preceding claims,
characterized in that, for a spectral line which

is determined from the residual spectrum in the
digitized original spectrum, only those spectral

lines having single separations and/or simple
fractions of these separations are formed into

histograms.
Use of the method for determining a cyclic
structure as claimed in one of the preceding

claims for classification of an aircraft which has
components that move cyclically and modulate a

radar signal.
Use of the method according to Claim 9 for
identification and/or classification of a

helicopter.
