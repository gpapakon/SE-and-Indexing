<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method of
forming an electrophotographic color transfer image, and
more particularly to a method of forming a color transfer
image using an electrophotographic process by which
toner images are completely transferred onto a receiving
material without being accompanied by degradation of
image quality upon the transfer and which provides color
duplicates being free from color shear and having good
storage stability, and an electrophotographic light-sensitive
material for use therein.Methods of forming color printings, color
duplicates or color proofs (proofs for printing) which
comprises conducting development with electrophotographic
developing agents to form a plurality of overlapping
color toner images directly on the surface of
electrophotographic light-sensitive element and transferring
at once the resulting color images onto a
receiving material such as printing paper are known.The developing methods include a so-called dry
type developing method and wet type developing method. 
Color images obtained by the wet type developing method
are preferred because of little color shear and good
resolution as compared with those formed with dry
toners. However, it is very difficult to directly
transfer wet type toner images entirely from the surface
of the light-sensitive element to printing paper.In order to solve this problem, a transfer
technique in which a non-aqueous solvent is supplied
between a light-sensitive element and a receiving
material and then transfer is electrostatically
performed is described in JP-A-2-272469 (the term "JP-A"
as used herein means an "unexamined published Japanese
patent application").Also, a method in which a transparent film is
first laminated on the surface of a light-sensitive
element, wet type toner images are formed by an electrophotographic
process on the film, and then the film
bearing the toner images is separated from the light-sensitive
element and stuck on paper, thereby forming
transferred images is described in JP-A-2-115865 and JP-A-2-115866.
According to the method, the film to be
laminated has suitably a thickness of 9 µm. However,
the production and handling of a film having such
thickness is very troublesome and it is necessary to
arrange a special system for them. Further, in JP-B-2-43185 (the term "JP-B" as
used herein means an "examined Japanese patent publication"),
a method in which imagewise exposure through a
transparent electrophotographic light-sensitive element
and development are conducted repeatedly to form
