<ABSTRACT>
A tennis racket frame comprising a string-installing 
portion (10), T-shaped in cross section, formed along the 

entire periphery of a ball-hitting surface thereof. The 
string-installing portion (10) comprises a projection (20) 

formed toward the ball-hitting surface in which strings are 
installed and a base (21) perpendicular to the projection 

(20). A plurality of gut holes (25) is formed on the 
projection (20) such that each of the gut holes (25) penetrates 

through the center thereof. A plurality of gut holes 
(24) is formed on the bottom surface of a concave (23) of the 

base (21) such that each of the gut holes (24) penetrates 
through the center of the base (21).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a tennis racket
frame and more particularly, to the tennis racket allowed to
have a favorable repulsion performance and ball control
performance and gives a soft ball-hitting feeling to a player
by improving the cross sectional configuration of a string-installing
portion of the frame thereof.Researches have been made to improve the performance
of the tennis racket and as a result, tennis rackets in
various configurations have been proposed. EP-A-0260208 shows a tennis racket with equal string
lengths for a number of strings. This is achieved for the
cross strings by parts of the string-installing portion of
the frame having a projection towards the centre of the
string-installing portion, in order to keep the distance
from one side of the string-installing portion to the
other constant.A racket with a head portion defined by a frame having an
imperforated wall extending around the greater part of
racket head, and integral with the wall a rigid section
which is perforated at intervalls to receive the stringing
and whichis formed as an elongate hollow protuberance
projecting at least partially inwardly of the wall towards
the centre of the racket head is shown in EP-A-0040551. The configurations
of the tennis rackets developed recently are classified into
the following three types:
1. Mid (standard) size racket2. Racket having a large ball-hitting surface, namely,
so-called large racket3. Racket having the vertical sectional area of a
string-installing section of racket frame great, namely, so-called
thick racketThe tennis racket is required to have a favorable
repulsion performance and ball control performance and gives
a soft ball-hitting feeling to a player. The main factor for 
determining these performances is spring characteristics.The spring characteristics are classified into the
following four types as shown in Figs. 15A, 15B, and 15C in
consideration of the construction of the racket.
(1) Spring shown by (A) of Fig. 15 generated by the
deformation of strings 1.(2) Spring shown by (B) of Fig. 15 generated by the
deformation of a supporting portion (string-installing
portion) 2 for supporting the strings 1.(3) Spring shown by (C) of Fig. 15 generated by the in-plane
deformation of a racket frame 3.(4) Spring shown by (D) of Fig. 15 generated by the out-of-plane
deformation of the racket frame 3.It is considered that the above four springs are
connected in series with each other and hence a most deformable
spring determines the characteristic of the

<CLAIMS>
A tennis racket frame comprising:

a grip portion (12);
throat portion (11);
and a string-installing portion (10) formed
around the periphery of a ball-hitting surface,

said string-installing portion (10) having a T-shaped
cross section comprising a projection (20) which projects

towards the ball-hitting surface and in which
strings are installed, and a base (21) perpendicular to

said projection,
characterized
 by the following
features:
the racket frame is molded of fiber reinforced
resin;
the base (21) and the projection (20) of said T-shaped cross
section together form a single hollow profile;
the width (b1) of the projection (20) and the
width (B) of the string-installing portion (10)

are set to fullfil the formula:

3mm ≤ b1 ≤ 0,7 B;
the thickness (h1) of the projection (20) and the
thickness (h) of the base (21) are set to fulfil

the formula:

3mm ≤ h1 ≤ 0,75 h.
The tennis racket frame as defined in claim 1,
wherein a concave

is formed on an outer surface of said base such that a grommet
is inserted to the concave. 
The tennis racket frame as defined in claim 2,
wherein said string-installing portion has a plurality of gut

holes formed on said projection such that each of the gut
holes penetrates through a center thereof and a plurality of

gut holes formed on a bottom surface of said concave such that
each of the gut holes penetrates through the center of the

base.
The tennis racket frame as defined in claim 1,
wherein the projection and the base are formed symmetrical

with respect to a center line passing through a center of the
projection.
The tennis racket frame as defined in claim 3,
wherein the gut holes are formed at regular intervals and 

though a center line passing through the center of the
projection.
