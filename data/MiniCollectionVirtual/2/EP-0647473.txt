<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a catalyst for the alkylation of paraffins and 
the method of preparing the catalyst. Isooctanes or trimethylpentanes (TMP) are among the most 
desirable components of motor alkylate gasoline and 2,2,4-trimethylpentane 
(isooctane) has long been the standard of 
measurement for the anti-knock properties of gasoline. The most 
common method of producing motor alkylate isooctane in commercial 
refineries is the alkylation of isobutane with butenes in the 
presence of a strong acid catalyst. Two acids currently used in 
alkylation plants are concentrated sulfuric acid and hydrofluoric 
acid. In these common processes the reactants are admixed with 
the acid in a contactor and the products separated from any 
unreacted reactants and the acid. The prior art in this area is 
well known. The drawbacks to the use of the sulfuric or 
hydrofluoric acid processes are readily apparent. Large 
quantities of the acids, which are highly corrosive, dangerous to 
handle and potentially a hazard to the environment, are required. The search for safer particulate solid catalysts has been  
 
intense. Zeolites have been the most widely studied of the solid 
alkylation catalysts. For example, Kirsch, et al in U.S. Patents 
3,665,813 and 3,706,814 disclose the use of such zeolites in 
"continuous" alkylation processes. European Patent 0174836 
discloses sulfated zirconia as a solid superacid for paraffin 
isomerization and isoparaffin alkylation. US Pat. No.'s 
4,056,578 and 4,180,695 disclose perfluoropolymersulfonic acid 
(PFPSA) as an alkylation catalyst. U.K. patent 1,389,237 
discloses an antimony pentafluoride/acid on a carbon support as 
catalyst for alkylation. Other catalyst compositions which have 
been found to be initially active for alkylation include 
supported HF-antimony pentafluoride, (U.S. Patent 3,852,371); a 
Lewis Acid and Group VIII metal intercalated in graphite, (U.S. 
Patent 3,976,714); and a cation exchange resin complexed with 
BF3 and HF, (U.S. Patent 3,879,489). U.S. Patent 4,918,255 
describes a process for alkylating isoalkanes with olefins using 
a Lewis acid such as boron trifluoride, boron trichloride, 
antimony pentafluoride or aluminum trichloride deposited on 
inorganic oxide such as a wide pore zeolite, SiO2 or Al2O3. Early work by Kirsch, et al, cited above using zeolites 
disclosed a catalyst life of about 10 grams of alkylate per gram 
of catalyst used. Further a method for increasing the life of 
zeolite catalysts using a regenerative process disclosed as in
