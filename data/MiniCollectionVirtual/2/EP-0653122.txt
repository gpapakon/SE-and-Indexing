<ABSTRACT>
The invention concerns the control of a symmetrical bipolar transistor (1) or a symmetrical bipolar transistor structure. The invention calls for a current mirror circuit (5; 6) to be connected to each of the two work electrodes (21, 22), the two current mirror circuits (5; 6) being connected to each other at their bases, and their collectors operating on inverse current mirror circuits (7; 8) which produce the control current necessary to control the bipolar transistor.

Driving control for a symmetrical bipolar 
transistor (1) or for a symmetrical bipolar transistor 

structure, characterised in that connected to the two 
working electrodes (21, 22) there is a respective 

current-mirror circuit arrangement (5; 6), wherein the 
two current-mirror circuit arrangements (5; 6) are 

connected together by means of their bases, and their 
collectors operate into inverse current-mirror circuit 

arrangements (7; 8), which activate a switch (14) via 
which there flows the base current that is required by 

the bipolar transistor, wherein the switch (14) does 
not deliver a base current if the two working 

electrodes of the symmetrical bipolar transistor are at 
the same potential and wherein a reference current 

(excitation current 20) is supplied to the base 
terminals of the first current-mirror circuit 

arrangements (5, 6). 
Driving control according to claim 1, 
characterised in that the current-mirror circuit 

arrangements as first current-mirror circuit 
arrangements (5; 6) are each extended by a second 

amplifying current-mirror circuit arrangement (17; 18), 
which second current-mirror circuit arrangements are 

each connected to a further collector of the first 
current-mirror circuit arrangement (5; 6). 
Driving control according to claim 2, 
characterised in that the second amplifying current-mirror 

circuit arrangements (17, 18) are connected to 
the first current-mirror circuit arrangements (5; 6) by 

way of coupled ENABLE switches (19).
