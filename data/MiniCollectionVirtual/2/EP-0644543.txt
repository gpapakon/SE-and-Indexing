<ABSTRACT>
When data stored in a RAM (31) has a deficiency to fill one cluster, the deficiency is read out from a 
magnetooptic disk (22) to complete one cluster of data. The rewrite operation on the disk (22) is performed by the 

cluster by a system controller (29) through the RAM (31).

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a disc recording apparatus in
which data is formed in clusters and recorded on a disc on the
cluster basis.In a disc adapted for recording interleaved data thereon,
data formed into clusters are recorded on the cluster basis in
order to take data rewriting into account, as disclosed in, for
example, JP Patent Kokai Publication No.4-105271 or No.4-301264.As shown for example in Fig.1, each cluster is constituted
by a link sector and a data sector, and the length of the link
sector is selected to be longer than an interleaving length. In
this manner, each cluster is not affected by interleaving from
neighboring clusters and recording and/or reproduction may be
made independently on the cluster basis.That is, with a disc on which data recorded thereon is
interleaved data, data is recorded across plural sectors, without
data being present independently on the sector basis. 
Consequently, rewriting of a particular sector cannot
performed by one operation and rewriting is to be performed on
the cluster basis.Meanwhile, in a disc recording apparatus in which data is
grouped into clusters and recorded on the cluster basis, if data
of the last cluster of main data for a writing (first writing)
is short of one full cluster, the portion of the cluster devoid
of data is stuffed with void data to form one-cluster data and
main data for the next writing (second writing) is started with
the next cluster. This indicates that a wasteful recording area
10 is produced as a result of stuffing the data free portion with
void data.On the other hand, for rewriting data on the sector basis,
data of the sector which belongs to the cluster to be rewritten
and which is not rewritten has to be previously read out and
combined with data which is to be rewritten and which is held on
a random access memory. However, data readout needs to be made
each time rewriting on the sector basis is performed, resulting
in the increased overhead until completion of recording. From the European patent application EP-A-0 472 343 a disc
recording/reproducing apparatus is known, which records
digital data by an optical head such that time compressed
digital data arranged into a plurality of clusters at an
interval of a predetermined number of sectors, a cluster-linking
sector having a length longer than an interleaving
length is provided at each linking part of each cluster and
the digital data are subsequently interleaved and recorded
on a disc-shaped recording medium so that interleaving at
the time of data recording on a

<CLAIMS>
A disc recording apparatus for forming recording data into a cluster for
recording the recording data on a disc on the cluster basis, comprising


input means (32) via which the recording data enters the apparatus from outside,
a memory (31) for transiently storing the recording data supplied via said input

means,
recording means (25) for recording said stored sector-based recording data on
said disc as cluster, and characterized by
control means (29) for detecting the presence of a complete cluster in the
memory and for suspending a recording operation of the recording data while the

recording data supplied from outside by one transfer operation and transiently stored in
said memory (31) has a data volume short of one cluster, in the event of a special condition reading out and

supplementing the deficit data by data read from a corresponding cluster on the disc, so
as to form one-cluster recording data, supplying the recording data having the data

volume corresponding to one cluster to said recording means and recording the
recording data on the cluster basis on said disc.
The disc recording apparatus as claimed in claim 1 wherein said control means
comprises detection means for detecting that the recording data stored in said memory

has reached one cluster and controls said memory so that, each time it is detected that
data stored in said memory has reached the volume of one cluster, the one-cluster

recording data is supplied to said recording means.
The disc recording apparatus as claimed in claim 1 wherein said control means
holds the one-cluster data supplied from said memory to said recording means on said

memory even after the data is supplied to said recording means.
The disc recording apparatus as claimed in claim 1 wherein said control means
comprises means for detecting a first special condition when the recording data has not been supplied to said

input means for a pre-set time, and for generating a command to take out data short of
one cluster if no recording data has been supplied for a pre-set time.
The disc recording apparatus as claimed in claim 1 wherein said control means
comprises ejection detection means for detecting a second special condition and generating a command for ejecting said disc and

for generating a command to take out data short of one cluster on detection of
impending disc ejection. 
The disc recording apparatus as claimed in claim 1 wherein said control means
controls said recording means so that, on detection of impending disc ejection, data

indicating the recording position on the disc of the one-cluster data supplemented with
the deficit data is recorded on the disc.
The disc recording apparatus as claimed in one of claims 1 to 6,
wherein the control means controls the rewriting operation of two consecutive data files

so that data of a data volume less one cluster produced at a trailing portion of the first
of said two consecutive data files is written on said disc and simultaneously stored in

said memory and synthesized with the leading portion of the second of said two
consecutive data files to form one-cluster data, which are recorded on said disc.
