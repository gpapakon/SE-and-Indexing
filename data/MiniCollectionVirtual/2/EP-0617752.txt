<DESCRIPTION>
 Descriptionof the invention having as title:ARMOURED ROLLER BL IND FOR WINDOWS AND THE L I KEThe common systems on the market for closing windows, shops, etc., carry out their task only through the lowering of the slats that slide up and down inside the "U" type side runner guides which make the forcing easy. In the name of Giovanetti Quinto, the Italian Patent N. 1187106 of December 16th 1987 has been granted, absorbed by the European Patent N. 0248837 registered on December 12th 1989 in the Central Patents Office, for a device that for the first time has anchored the slats of the mentioned roller blinds to the walls.Still in the name of Giovanetti Quinto the Italian Patent N. 1234471 of May 18th 1992 has been granted for the invention of an armoured roller blind with slats that can be spaced out between them. This invention adds in an autonomous way to the previous ones of the same author, creating a new roller blind (Fig. 1) which, together with the merit of being a very difficult to overcome barrier, has a comfortable passage of air and light and is of easy and cheap production. Furthermore, this invention changes the current technique to block the sliding of the blinds with bolts inserted in the slats, applying inside the side runner guides (17, 24) special rods (20) whose teeth (21) inserting themselves between the coupling pins (14, 15) of the slats to the guides (17, 24) stop them in the desired position. This way every slat of the rolling sheet creates an autonomous barrier. The roller blind uses steels fitting for every single necessity, its forcing requires special equipment, time, noise, all factors which exclude slapdash attacks of the thieves. The installing is not difficult since the roller blinds can be placed in the seats prepared for other rolling shutters. It can work both manually as well as with an electric engine. Mechanical device and working process.The slats (1) of the roller blind can be produced with extruded metal or sheet steel. They have a small central hole (5) to contain the sheating (7) 

with at the top a long neck (2) which ends with a hook (3) where wide horizontal windows are punched; at the bottom they have two parallel walls and one of them ends with a hook (4) for the neck seal (2) of the below slat. The slats can be produced in different dimensions and thicknesses according to the required protection.In the empty part of the slat (5) a steel sqare tube is inserted (Fig. 4 N. 7); its ends are cut screw for the screwing of the coupling pins (14, 15) to the side

<CLAIMS>
 CLAIMS 1) Device for the accomplishment of an armoured roller blind which can be applied to windows and in the rooms of other premises, characterized by the inclusion of a metal slat with wide windows (Fig. 1, 2 N. 1) strengthened in its inner cavity (5) by a steel frame (Fig. 3, 4 N. 1, 7, 9), a slat linked by head pins (14, 15) to special runner guides (Fig. 3, 5, 6 N. 17, 24) fixed with screws (25) to the lateral walls and having inside toothed rods (20) which stop the sliding of every single slat (19 in the wanted position. 2) Metal slat (Fig.l, 2, 3 N. 1) according to claim N. 1, characterized by the fact that its particular profile made up by a central body (5) with a long superior neck (2) which ends as a hook (3) to join the hook (4) of the slat (1) above in the cavity of which it finds full reception, allows wide horizontal windows (Fig. 2 N. 2) and the insertion of a steel frame (Fig. 3, 4 N. 7, 9) in the central part (5).
3) Device according to claim N. 1, characterized by the fact that each slat (1) receives in its cavity (5) a steel tube of the same dimension (7) with a round hole (8) where a cut-proof steel round (Fig. 3, 4 N. 9) is inserted, the hole is threaded in the two ends for the screwing of the coupling pins (14, 15) of the slats (1) to the lateral runner guides (17, 24).
4) Device according to claim 1, characterized by the fact that the first inferior slat contacting the treshold, has inserted a metal profile (Fig.3, 4 N. 10) which occupies the whole groove (6) of the slat (1) and it incorporates with an expansion outside used as plinth, the hook ending part as (4) of the slat.
5) Device according to claim N. 1, characterized by the fact that each runner guide totally inserted in the lateral wall (Fig. 3, 5 N. 17) has an inner part marked by two opposing fins (18) for the seal of the head of the pins (14) and a semicircular groove (19) to contain a toothed cylindrical rod (Fig. 3 N. 20, 21, 22) used as bolt to stop the stroke of every single pin (14), has also a seat to place fixing screws (25) of the runner guide (17) to the wall.
6) Device according to claim N. 1, characterized by the fact that each runner guide (Fig. 3, 6 N. 24) for the installing inside the common "U" type runner guides already existing has a groove marked by two opposing fins (18) for the seal of the head of the pins (15) besides another semicircular groove (19) to contain a toothed cylindrical rod (Fig. 3 N. 


20, 21, 22) used as bolt to stop the stroke of every single pin (15), it has also two outer fins to place the fixing screw (25) to the wall.
7) Device according to claim N. 1, characterized by the fact that each runner guide (Fig. 3 N. 17, 24) is equipped with a cylindrical rod (Fig. 3 N. 20) with a series of teeth (21) spaced out between them in corrispondence to the position of the coupling pins (14, 15) which are used to stop the sliding of the mentioned pins (14, 15) inside the runner guides (17, 24).
8) Device according to claim N. 1, characterized by the fact that each slat (1) has in its ends a metal plug (Fig. 3, 4 N. 12) used for the fixing of the armouring tube (7) and the regular alignment of the slats (1), the plug is blocked inside the slat (1) by the neck (16) of the pins (14, 15).
9) Relative profiles and accessory pieces created and used according to any of the above mentioned claims.
