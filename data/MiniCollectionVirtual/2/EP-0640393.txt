<ABSTRACT>
The invention is in the field of packaging and storing test elements which are generally sensitive to atmospheric humidity or water vapour. The invention relates to a system for storing test elements for analysis of sample liquids in which two or more test elements are located in a storage container which can be sealed tightly against water vapour and contains a desiccant in its interior.

<CLAIMS>
System (1) for the storage of test elements for the
analysis of sample liquids in which two or more

test elements are present in the system with a flap
(5) and a basic body with an opening, wherein


the basic body is a holder (2) for a storage
container (20) for test elements and the flap (5)

is pressed automatically by a return device with a
spring mechanism which is tensioned when the system

is opened as well as closed, onto the opening of
the basic body or of the storage container (20) to

form a seal so that the test elements inside the
system are protected against entry of water vapour.
System as claimed in claim 1, in which a desiccant
is present inside the storage container (20) or

inside the basic body.
System as claimed in claim 1 which has a slide (4)
which opens the flap (5) of the system.
System as claimed in claim 1, in which the storage
container (20) can be removed from the holder.
System as claimed in claim 1, in which the storage
container (20) can be inserted into the holder (2)

from the side facing away from the flap (5). 
System as claimed in claim 1, in which a seal (7)
is present on the flap (5) or the basic body.
System as claimed in claim 1, in which batch-specific
data of the test elements are located on

the system alphanumerically, as bar codes or as
magnetic strips.
System as claimed in claim 1, in which the storage

container (20) is a refill pack.
