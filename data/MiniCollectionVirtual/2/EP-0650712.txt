<ABSTRACT>
An adjustable face shield (10) for protecting the face 
of the wearer, having a mask (12) adapted to cover the nose 

and mouth of the wearer and a flexible eye shield 
having a transparent upper portion adapted to fit over 

the eyes of the wearer. The eye shield has a base 
portion (16) fixedly attached to the mask so that the upper 

portion (22) of the eye shield can pivot towards or away 
from the wearer's face. Adjustable attachment means (24, 26) 

mounted on the eye shield fits around the head of the 
wearer to position the eye shield over the eyes and is 

adapted to adjust the angular position of the upper 
portion of the eye shield relative to the face of the 

wearer as the adjustable means is moved up or down on 
the back of the head of the wearer.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a face shield having a
face mask and an eye shield and having a means to
adjust the eye shield for improved fit and comfort.
The invention further relates to a method for providing
the same.Present face shields constructed by attaching
transparent plastic film eye shields to face masks fit
poorly and are uncomfortable. For example, a number of
face shields have eye shield portions which fit close
to the eyes and the nose of the wearer, but during use
may form a scoop which allows potentially harmful
liquid droplets (such as blood) to reach the wearer's
eyes. Other eye shields fit so tightly that they can be
uncomfortable. Wearers who must wear eye glasses have
additional difficulties because the glasses hold the
eye shield away from the face, thereby reducing the
protection of the eyes from splashing liquids.US-A-4,797,956, US-A-2,056,753,
US-A-4,796,621, US-A-4,825,878,
and US-A-4,821,340 disclose an eye shield of
some sort worn in conjunction with a mask. In these
references the eye shield is adapted to be worn in a
certain position, fixed by an attachment at or above
eye level in contact with or closely adjacent the
wearer's face.PCT/US89/01629
discloses a face mask having an eye shield attached to
its upper margin. An adjustable band may be included
at the sides of the transparent eye shield portion to
hold it in position over the eyes of the wearer.
However, the eye shield is intended to be held in a 
fixed position close to the wearer's face with cushions to
set off the eye shield from the face.US-A-4,944,294, US-A-5,020,533
and US-A-5,150,703
which is used as basis for the preamble of claim 1,
disclose face masks with
visors or eye shields which attach to and extend upwards
from masks, but where no means for pivoting the eye
shields away from the face are disclosed.The present Invention ameliorates the limitations of
the prior art by providing a face shield adapted for rapid
and convenient adjustment of the position of the eye
shield relative to the wearer's face. In broad terms the
invention
as specified in claim 1
can be considered as an adjustable face shield
for protecting the face of a wearer.Preferred embodiments of the invention are further specified in
the dependent claims. Claims 9 and 10 specify a method of making
a face shield according to claim 1. The invention provides an adjustable face shield
for protecting the face of a wearer, wherein the eye
shield can be adjusted to various angular positions
relative to the face of the wearer.An advantage of the
