<ABSTRACT>
A feature control system includes structure (Fig. 3) for initiating a change from one state to another state in response to a precipitating event, structure (Fig. 4) for generating a signal to identify a list of tasks to perform the transition, structure for retrieving the list of tasks from a previously formatted array and structure (Fig. 5) for processing the tasks to arrive at the second state. The present invention also provides a method for creating state table instructions which method includes the steps of formatting a program code to correspond to single entry two dimensional arrays (Fig. 6), converting the program code to discrete integer pointers (Fig. 7), interconnecting the tables to perform the tasks in a linear fashion (Figs. 8 
&
 9) and processing the tasks to arrive at a new state (Fig. 10).

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to telecommunications
exchanges and, more particularly, to a system for
providing features within a telecommunications
exchange.A portion of the disclosure of this patent
document contains material to which a claim of
copyright protection is made. The copyright owner has
no objection to the facsimile reproduction by anyone of
the patent document or the patent disclosure, as it
appears in the Patent and Trademark Office patent file
or records, but reserves all other rights whatsoever.State tables have been used in prior art systems
to control the operation of a real-time process by
designating a set of tasks to be performed in order to
effect a transition from one state to the other. 
Computer languages have been developed wherein
transitions from state to state are caused by the
execution of a specific set of instructions imbedded
within the computer code itself. These systems have
proved cumbersome because as modifications to the
system are required, the computer program must be
recompiled along with the new lines of code necessary
to achieve the desired changes and then downloaded to
the switch.State control techniques have been advantageously
implemented in telecommunications exchanges due to the
nature of the two party model for most communications.
With such techniques, each party is sequentially
transitioned from state to state to implement the
various features of the desired communication. Those
transitions are conveniently performed in groups of
tasks associated with either a particular special
feature or simply those associated with Plain Old
Telephone (POT) services. The provision of different
features, such as three-way calling, has been a growing
and important element in the sale of telecommunications
services and the rapid implementation and modification
of such features is vital to serving the modern
telecommunications customer.However, different customers may want different
behavior for a given feature. Thus, flexibility in
modifying features is important as customers change.
Further, residential and business subscribers which are
likely to have different needs are also likely to be
utilizing the same switch. With a feature implemented
in fixed, compiled code it is expensive to provide for
the many variations in the feature which will be
required for the various particular customer
applications. The code becomes large and complicated
if multiple variants of a feature are placed in one 
block in fixed code. If a separate block is provided
for each variant then the

A method of implementing a telecommunications
feature within a telecommunications switch having memory

means and a plurality of system states characterized by the
steps of:


defining a first table (150,152) for said
telecommunications feature the various states (15) through

which a call can transit and the events (152) which
precipitate those state transitions, said first table

(150,152) specifying for a given state and event an index
to a list of tasks (154) to be performed in order to

complete that transition;
defining in a second table (154,156) an array of
lists (154) of tasks, each list (154) specifying a sequence

of tasks (156) to be performed in association with the list
(154);
defining a third table (158,STATE) for a given
state (STATE) and event (158) an index to the next state to

which the call should transition;
executing a feature providing program with the
memory, the feature the programs comprising executable task

code to access and analyze said first table (150,152), via
state (150) and event (152) indexes, to determine which list

of tasks (154) within said second table (154,156) is to be
accessed;
accessing (210) the determined list of tasks (154)
and executing (216) each of the tasks (156) on the list

(154) in sequence; and
executing said feature providing program in
response to completion of each of the tasks (156) on said

list (154) to access and analyze the third table (158,STATE)
