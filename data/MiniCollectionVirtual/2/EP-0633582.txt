<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method of
fabricating a rare earth element (hereinafter, referred
to as "R")-Fe-B based alloy magnetic powder excellent in
magnetic anisotropy, a method of fabricating an R-Fe-B-Co
based alloy magnetic powder excellent in magnetic
anisotropy and temperature characteristic, and further
the powders fabricated by the above methods; and
particularly to a method of stably fabricating on a
large scale the above magnetic powders by suppressing
deviation in magnetic characteristics.The present invention also concerns a resin bonded
magnet fabricated using the above R-Fe-B-Co alloy
magnetic powder by injection molding or compression
molding.Recently, electronic devices have been required to
be miniaturized, to be enhanced in efficiency, and to be 
diversified; and further, when being used for automobile,
they have been required to withstand harsh
environments exposed at high temperatures. Along with
the above demands for the electronic devices, permanent
magnets have been increasingly required to possess high
performances. To meet these demands, rare earth magnets
have been actively developed as permanent magnets, and
particularly, in recent years, R-Fe-B based alloys have
been focussed as permanent magnet materials exhibiting
excellent magnetic characteristics. Thus R-Fe-B based
alloy magnetic powders as the sources of the above R-Fe-B
based alloys have been developed.In particular, as a method of fabricating magnetic
powders excellent in magnetic properties, there has been
remarked a method of fabricating R-Fe-B based alloy
magnetic powders by a method wherein R-Fe-B based alloys
are subjected to hydrogen absorbing treatment, followed
by dehydrogenation. For example, Japanese Patent Laid-open
Gazette No. HEI 1-132106 discloses an R-Fe-B based
alloy magnetic powder of this type.The above R-Fe-B based alloy magnetic powder is
fabricated by holding an ingot of an R-Fe-B based alloy
mainly containing a ferro-magnetic R2Fe14B type
intermetallic compound (hereinafter, referred to as 
"R2Fe14B type phase") or a powder of the ingot in a
hydrogen atmosphere heated at a high temperature for
hydrogen absorption; dehydrogenating at the same high
temperature; and dehydrogenating the ingot or the powder
thereof in a vacuum atmosphere, to thus generate the
R2Fe14B type phase as a ferro-magnetic phase again. The
R-Fe-B based alloy magnetic powder thus obtained has an
aggregate structure mainly containing an extremely fine
recrystallized structure of the R2Fe14B type phase
having an average
