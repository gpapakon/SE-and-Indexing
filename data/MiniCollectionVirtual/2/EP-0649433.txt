<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to peptide regions of 
the human TLP proteic complexes (proteins released from 
tumors) with antigenic activity, as well as to 
antibodies reacting with such proteins, to be used for 
diagnostic and clinical purposes. TLP complexes are proteic complexes present in 
human tumor cells, particularly in lung carcinoma 
cells. TLPs are isolated from tumoral tissues, as 
described in the EP 283 433, the description thereof is 
incorporated herein as reference. In particular, TLPs 
are isolated from homogenized tumoral tissues according 
to the following steps: 
three freeze-thawing cycles; a sonication step; a first centrifugation at 3000 x g, keeping 
supernatant I; a second centrifugation of sediment I at 3000 x g, 
keeping supernatant II; a third centrifugation of sediment II at 3000 x g, 
keeping supernatant III; a collection of supernatants I, II and III;  
a further purification by isolelectric focusing column 
and/or chromatographc column. It is very useful to have diagnostic assays to 
identify such complexes, or fractions thereof, from 
crude lung extracts. Author's attempts to obtain specific antibodies 
against whole TPL's did not succeed. Therefore it is 
important to identify TLP antigenic regions (epitopes) 
and raise antibodies thereof, in order to obtain 
specific reactants.  
 The author of the present invention has 
identified peptide sequences of the TLP 100 KDa protein 
having antigenic activity, has obtained specific 
antibodies and has demonstrated that said antibodies 
reacted specifically with TLPs from lung carcinomas. Accordingly, an object of this invention is an 
antigenic peptide of Tumour liberated particles (TLP) 
having the amino acid sequence comprised within the 
sequence of the 100 KDa protein of TLP. According to a preferred embodiment of the 
invention, said peptide has at least one of the amino 
acid sequences listed at the end of the specification 
as Seq ID N1, Seq ID N2 or Seq ID N3. Preferably said  
 
peptides are of synthetic origin, alternatively of natural 
source. In a further embodiment of the invention, said 
peptide comprises a cysteine residue at either its carboxylic 
or amidic terminal group, and a molecule carrier, covalently 
bound to said residue; preferably said molecule carrier is 
hemocyanin, most preferably said hemocyanin is obtained from 
oysters. Another object of the invention are antibodies able 
to specifically detect TLP proteins by recognizing an 
antigenic peptide of Tumour liberated particles (TLP) having 
the amino
