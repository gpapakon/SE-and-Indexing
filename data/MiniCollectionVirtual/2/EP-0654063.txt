<ABSTRACT>
Super high flow ethylene polymer compositions comprising at least one linear ethylene polymer are disclosed which have improved processability for use in making thermally formed articles (for example, thin-walled lids, cups and containers). The compositions have a processing index from 0.005 KPoise to 1 KPoise and are particularly useful in thermal forming processes having shear rates of at least 2,000 sec-1 (for example, injection molding processses). The compositions can be used to make thin-walled lids and cups and have good environmental stress crack resistance and Gullwing Tear properties.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to ethylene polymer compositions 
having improved processing. The compositions comprise at least one 
linear ethylene polymer having a density from 0.87 to 0.965 grams/cubic 
centimeter, a melt index (I2) from 0.1 to 2 grams/10 minutes, a melt 
index (I10) from 28 to 55 grams/10 minutes, a melt flow ratio (I10/I2) 
from 14 to 550, and a processing index (PI) from 0.005 Kpoise to 1 Kpoise. 
The compositions are especially useful in making thermally formed 
articles such as thin-walled lids and cups. It has been believed that the injection molding of 
thinwalling articles by numerous different olefinic polymers and/or 
blends required the use of polymers having both (1) a very high melt 
index (I2) (for example, I2 of greater than about 30 grams/10 minutes, 
usually about 100 grams/10 minutes) in order to fill a multiple cavity 
mold and thus reduce the cycle time, as in contrast to the use of very 
low I2 (less than about 2 grams/10 minutes) resins, and (2) a narrow 
molecular weight distribution (indicated by a low value of weight 
average molecular weight divided by number average molecular weight 
(Mw/Mn), as opposed to broad molecular weight distribution, in order to 
obtain the best molded article. For example, Modern Plastics International, p. 81 (August, 
1983) discloses that the "super high flow" polyethylene resins having a 
melt index (I2) of 100 grams/10 minutes and higher can reduce the cycle 
time for thinwalling injection molding applications. Modern Plastics, pp. 46-49 (June 1990), discloses that both 
The Dow Chemical Company and Occidental Chemical Co. are capable 
of making "asymmetrical shaped" high density polyethylene (HDPE) 
resins. Dow's asymmetrical shaped resins are said to process like a  
 
resin having I2 of 100 grams/10 minutes, yet retain physical properties 
like a resin having I2 of 40 grams/10 minutes. U.S. Patents 4,192,935 and 4,294,794 each disclose an olefinic 
copolymer having a density of 0.940-0.960 grams/cubic centimeter, a 
melt index in the range of 100-200 grams/10 minutes, and a Mw/Mn 
ratio of less than 5 for use in injection molding of thinwalling articles. U.S. Patent 5,015,511 (Treybig et al) discloses olefinic 
polymers having a melt index in the range of 80-200 grams/10 minutes, 
melt flow ratio (I10/I2) in the range of 7.2 to 14, a Mw/Mn ratio in the 
range of 6.7-14.6 and a density in the range of 0.925 to 0.940 grams/cubic 
centimeter which are used for injection molding of thin walled 
containers with a thickness in the range
