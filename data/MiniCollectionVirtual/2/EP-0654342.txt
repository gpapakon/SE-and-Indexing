<ABSTRACT>
A method and apparatus for compression molding closure 
liners wherein a set of tooling including a first assembly (35) and 

second assembly (36) which are movable toward and away from one 
another. The first assembly (35) of tooling has a liner forming 

member and a closure engaging sleeve thereon and the second 
assembly (36) has a closure supporting pad (41) thereon. A cam (37) is 

associated with the first assembly of tooling for moving the 
closure engaging sleeve into engagement with a closure and the 

liner forming member into position for compression molding a 
charge of plastic extrudate in the closure when it is supported 

on the closure supporting pad (41). A gas cylinder (39) is associated 
with the closure supporting pad providing a predetermined 

controlled pressure that determines the compression molding 
force on the plastic. In a preferred mode, a plurality of sets 

of tooling are provided in circumferentially spaced relation 
to one another on a turret.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a method of compression molding
liners in closures according to the preamble of claim 1 and
to apparatus according to the preamble of claim 7.In a method and apparatus of said kind (EP-A-0 037 651 =
US-A-4,388,058) the closure together with the laminar
material is put onto the surface of a support and a tooling
assembly is moved by a fixed stroke onto the liner material
to form the liner. The tooling assembly comprises an inner
punch and an outer bushing, both connected to a main body
which can be raised and lowered. Furthermore, the outer
bushing can be driven by a piston for the fixed stroke. The
support does not yield.In producing a shaped body of plastic material (EP-A-0
175 642 = US-A-4,735,761) an upper and a lower tool member
are closed as by cams and a pressure fluid cylinder is
activated to apply the pressing force onto the plastics
material. The lower tool in the form of a die does not
yield.The form of liners in closures is also known from US-A-2,072,536,
2,930,081, 3,827,843, 4,274,822, 4,312,824 and
4,497,765.One of the problems in compression molding of liners
is that of controlling the molding force when molding liners
directly into a closure such that sufficient molding force
is used to fill the required seal volume and not produce
shorts and, at the same time, to limit this same force to
avoid flashing of the liner. This force should be consistent
and equal on each of all toolings to avoid process
variability. The use of compression springs to control this
force would not be consistent from tool to tool due to the
variability of the rating of the springs and due to the
inevitable fatigue that would be induced after substantial
length of running. Further, means to readily adjust the
molding force of all toolings with one adjustment of system
pressure is desirable. Among the objectives of the present invention are to
provide a method and apparatus for compression molding liners
in plastic closures wherein the molding pressure on the charge
that is being shaped to define the liner is accurately controlled;
wherein when an array of tooling is provided, each set of tooling
functions independently of the other; wherein the forming
pressure can be readily changed; and wherein the tooling can
be readily assembled and removed.The method and apparatus for compression molding closure liners
in accordance with the invention, are defined in the independent
claims 1 and 7 respectively. Preferred embodiments of the method and
apparatus are defined in claims 2-6 and 8-20
