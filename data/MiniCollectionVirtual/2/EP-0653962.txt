<ABSTRACT>
A method is provided for reducing NOx for high flow applications such as NOx abatement in an exhaust gas from an internal combustion engine operating under lean burn conditions wherein NOx is reduced by hydrocarbon reductants. The method employs a hydrothermally stable catalyst comprising transition metal-containing ZSM-5 which is prepared by in-situ crystallization of an aggregate comprising ZSM-5 seeds, silica, and a crystalline silicate.

<DESCRIPTION>
 ETHOD FOR REDUCING AUTOMATIVE NOx EMISSIONS IN LEAN BURN INTERNAL COMBUSTION ENGINE EXHAUST USING ZEOLITESThis invention is concerned with a method for reduction of nitrogen oxides contained in a gaseous stream such as lean burning internal combustion engine exhaust. The method employs a hydrothermally stable catalyst comprising transition metal-containing ZSM-5 which is prepared by in-situ crystallization of a preformed aggregate.Atmospheric pollution is a societal problem which is receiving much attention. The major source of such pollution is the extensive use of fossil fuels, although industrial and chemical processes, such as the manufacture of nitric acid, also contribute. The principal pollutants are nitrogen oxides, carbon monoxide, and perhaps to a lesser extent hydrocarbons, sulfur oxides and other objectionable gases and vapors.Although several nitrogen oxides are known which are relatively stable at ambient conditions, it is generally recognized that two of these, viz., nitric oxide (NO) and nitrogen dioxide (N02), are the principal contributors to smog and other undesirable environmental effects when they are discharged into the atmosphere. These effects will not be discussed further here since they are well recognized and have led various government authorities to restrict industrial emissions in an attempt to limit the level of the nitrogen oxides in the atmosphere. Nitric oxide and nitrogen dioxide, under appropriate conditions, are interconvertible according to the equation2NO + 02 = > 2N02. For purposes of the present invention, NO _ will be used herein to represent nitric oxide, nitrogen dioxide, and mixtures thereof. 

 Formation of man-made nitrogen oxides from the elements occurs in the high temperature zones of combustion processes.The internal combustion engine, and coal-, oil-, and gas-fired furnaces, boilers and incinerators, all contribute to NO emissions. In general, fuel-rich combustion mixtures produce exhaust gases with lower contents of NO x than do lean mixtures,Although the concentrations of NO in the exhaust gases produced by combustion usually are low, the aggregate amounts discharged in industrial and/or highly populated areas is adequate to cause problems.The so-called "stable" nitrogen oxides have in common the somewhat peculiar property that although they are thermodynamically very unstable with respect to decomposition into elemental oxygen and nitrogen, no simple, economical method has been described for inducing this decomposition. A variety of catalysts are
