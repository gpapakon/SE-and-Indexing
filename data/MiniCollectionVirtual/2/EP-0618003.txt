<ABSTRACT>
The heat exchanger according to the invention is provided as a packing element for mass transfer or mass conversion processes. This packing element includes a plurality of sheets which are arranged in parallel and are oriented along the main flow direction (15) of the mass and are formed by bodies (1) having cavities (17) for a heat transport medium. The heat-exchanging bodies (1) each have a pair of shells (1a, 1b) made of a film-like material. The side surfaces of the shells are profiled in a wave manner in such a way that the wave crests (141) are inclined relative to the main direction (15) and that opening and crossing flow channels result between neighbouring contacting sheets. Because of a relief-type profiling of the shells (1a, 1b), in addition to heat exchanger channels (17), a distribution and a collecting channel system (121, 121') is produced for the heat transport medium. On the interior of the shell pair, along each of the flow channels a multiplicity of connection points can be produced which make possible a connection stable to overpressure of the heat transport medium. The material of the shells (1a, 1b) is preferably composed of a metallic alloy and the profiling is produced by stamping.

Packing element for processes for the exchange or conversion of materials,
designed as a heat exchanger and comprising a number of parallel layers

which are aligned along a principal direction (15) and are formed by heat-transferring
units (1) with cavities (17) for a heat-transfer medium, wherein

these units (1) are each formed from foil-like material in the form of a pair of
shells (1a, 1b) in which the side faces each have a corrugated inner region

(10), an edge zone (12) and a transition zone (11) between the inner region
and the edge zone, wherein heat-transfer channels (17) are located in the inner

region and a distribution and collection system of channels (121, 121') is
located in the edge zone, the crests (141) of the corrugations in the inner

region are inclined with respect to the principal direction (15) and wherein
open and intersecting flow channels are provided between adjacent layers

which are in contact,

characterised in that the inner region (10) is designed in the form of an
"inverse mirror image" in such a way that the two shells can interlock and that

there are a large number of connection points along the heat-transfer channels
on the internal faces of the pair of shells.
Packing element according to Claim 1, characterised in that the connection
points are formed by spot-welding and produce a connection between the two

shells which can withstand the excess pressure of the heat-transfer medium.
Packing element according to Claim 1 or 2, characterised in that the material
comprising the shells (1a, 1b) consists of a metallic alloy and that the profile

is produced by impression moulding.
Packing element according to one of Claims 1 to 3, characterised in that the
heat-transferring units (1) are interconnected to form a stack by means of at

least one feed pipe and one drainage pipe (123, 123') for the heat-transfer
medium.
Packing element according to one of Claims 1 to 4, characterised in that the
edge zones (12) of the pair of shells (1a, 1b) are designed as mirror images of

each other.
Packing element according to Claim 1, characterised in that the inner regions
(10) are saw-tooth shaped, to be precise in such a way that the bottoms of the 

troughs are flat or rounded and the cross-sections of the heat-transfer channels
(17) are triangular.
Packing element according to Claim 1, characterised in that the inner regions
(10) are zig-zag shaped, to be precise in such a way that the cross-sections of

the heat-transfer channels (17) are rectangular.
Process for the exchange of materials in a column with at least one packing
element in accordance with one of Claims 1 to 7, characterised in that a

trickle-film flowing over the packing element and a gaseous substance are
passed in counterflow.
Process for the conversion of materials in a column with at least one packing
element in accordance with one of Claims 1 to 7, characterised in that

materials conversion is performed using a catalytic substance, wherein the
heat-transferring unit is coated with this substance.
Sorption process in a column with at least one packing element in accordance
with one of Claims 1 to 7, characterised in that a trickle-film containing a

sorption agent flowing over the packing element and a gaseous substance are
passed in counter flow.
Process for materials conversion in a biological flow reactor with at least one
packing element in accordance with one of Claims 1 to 7, characterised in that

materials conversion processes are performed using a suspension of
microorganisms in the flow channels in the packing elements.
Process for purifying a molten material in an apparatus with packing elements
in accordance with one of Claims 1 to 7, characterised in that the molten

material is purified by directional crystallisation in the flow channels of the
packing element, that is by periodic melting of the crystal layers formed

during crystallisation.
