<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a shrinkable cable sleeve (AM) having a filler for preventing the ingress of moisture. The filler consists of a filling adhesive (FKB) having rheological (deformable), especially thixotropic, properties, in which very small hollow bodies (MHK) are embedded which enlarge it and thus the volume of the entire filler when heated. The filling adhesive consists of a hot-fusion adhesive and is introduced into the cable sleeve (AM) in the solid state. During the shrinking process, this filling adhesive melts and completely fills all the cavities.
