<ABSTRACT>
A structure for dissipating the energy of waves impinging on a shore is disclosed which comprises one or more rows of modules (10) positioned adjacent the shore. Each module incorporates a number of vanes (49, 49', 49'', 126). The vanes are shaped and spaced so that a number of venturi passages (94) are defined between the vanes. Each vane has a frontal portion (49, 68', 68'') which faces away from the shore, and is inclined from the vertical so that it slopes away from the shore to define an entrapment chamber (96, 96', 96'') which forces an oncoming wave to pass through the venturi passages rather than over the module or be reflected. The sides (80) of the passages converge from front to back. A longitudinally extending hub (50) causes the passages to converge also in the vertical direction. Each vane may be X-shaped and substantially symmetrical about a vertical plane through its centre. The modules are cast from a cementitious material and may incorporate a number of the vanes joined together at the hub which is located at the centre of the X. The vanes may be joined together at their upper and lower ends by cross members (28, 30, 32, 34, 128, 130, 156, 158). The passages may incorporate cross vanes (106) which divide the passage into sub-passages. Other vane shapes are disclosed. The vanes may be individually fabricated.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to apparatus for dissipating the energy of waves in the sea or other body of water
thereby bringing about a reduction in the heights of waves and wave field velocity as well as wave
energy reflection.Most of the work done in this field appears to have been directed at reducing erosion of beaches and
shorelines. The present invention has been developed for the purpose of reducing the general damage
caused along coastlines by the ocean during severe storms.Considerable work has been done in these two related fields. Prior art known to the applicant includes
United States patents No. 4856934 (Nelson), No. 4431337 (Iwasa), No. 4269537 (O'Neill), No. 4711598 (Schaaf),
No. 4129006 (Payne), and No. 5015121 (Perret-Gentil) as well as the applicant's own European patent
application No 89.903981.2 (= EP-A-0 407 432). All of these disclosures show constructions which present barriers of one
kind or another which are wave permeable. Specification No. 4431337, for example, shows a wave
dissipation caisson with diverging wing pieces.According to the invention there is provided a structure for dissipating the energy of waves impinging on
a shore, as being defined in claim 1.A further aspect of the invention has been defined in dependent claim 2. In one aspect of the invention the frontal portion comprises an upper
zone which adjoins a lower zone, each of the zones being inclined from
the vertical with the upper end of the upper zone and the lower end of
the lower zone being further from the shore than the locality at which
the zones adjoin.In another aspect of the invention each vane has a back portion
comprising an upper zone which adjoins a lower zone, each of the zones
f acing the shore and being inclined from the vertical with the upper end
of the upper zone and the lower end of the lower zone being further from
the shore than the locality at which the zones adjoin. Each vane may
advantageously be substantially cruciform. It may furthermore
advantageously be substantially symmetrical about a vertical plane
through its centre.In one form of the invention the structure comprises a number of
substantially identical modules, each module being integrally cast from
a cementitious material and comprising a number of the vanes joined
together by cross members located at or adjacent the localities at which
the respective zones at which the back portions and the frontal portions
adjoin.In another form of the invention the structure comprises a number of
vanes joined together at their upper and lower

<CLAIMS>
A structure for dissipating the energy of waves impinging on a shore
which structure comprises one or more modules (10),

each module (10) comprising a box frame in
which there is located an assembly of vanes, the assembly of vanes having a number of spaced apart

vanes (49, 49", 49", 126) so that passages for the waves are defined between the vanes, 
characterised
in that
 the vanes (49, 49", 49", 126) project from a common, transversely disposed hub (50) and are
shaped and spaced so that a number of venturi passages (94) are defined between the vanes, the sides

(80) of the passages (94) converging from front to back and the transversely disposed hub (50)
causing the passages to converge also in the vertical direction. 
A structure according to claim 1 
CHARACTERISED IN THAT
 each vane has a frontal portion
[49, 68', 68"]
 at least part of which comprises a zone [82, 90] and a back portion at least part of

which comprises a zone [84, 92], the entrance being at least partly bounded by the frontal portions of

the vanes and the exit being at least partly bounded by the back portions of the vanes, the back
portions of the vanes being wider than the front portions of the vanes so that the passage is narrower

at the exit than at the entrance.
A structure according to claim 2, 
CHARACTERISED IN THAT
 the frontal portion comprises an
upper zone which adjoins a lower zone, each of the zones being inclined from the vertical with the

upper end of the upper zone and the lower end of the lower zone being further from the shore than
the locality [60]
 at which the zones adjoin.
A structure according to claim 3, 
CHARACTERISED IN THAT
 each vane has a back portion
comprising an upper zone which adjoins a lower zone, each of the zones facing the shore and being

inclined from the vertical with the upper end of the upper zone and the lower end of the lower zone
being further from the shore than the locality at which the zones adjoin.
A structure according to claim 4, 
CHARACTERISED IN THAT
 each vane is substantially
cruciform, being substantially symmetrical about a vertical plane through its centre.
A structure according to claim 4, 
CHARACTERISED IN THAT
 it comprises a number of
substantially identical modules [10]
 each module being integrally cast from a cementitious material
and comprising a number of the vanes joined together by cross members [50]
 located at or adjacent
the localities at which the respective zones at which the back portions and the frontal portions adjoin.
A structure according to claim 1, 
CHARACTERISED IN THAT
 it comprises a number of vanes
