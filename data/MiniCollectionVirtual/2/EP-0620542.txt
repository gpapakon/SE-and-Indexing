<ABSTRACT>
A folded label with a lower side which has a self-adhesive compound on its back and with a plurality of sides which lie on the front of the lower side in the folded-together state and result in an elongate strip or a sheet in the pulled-apart or opened-out state together with the lower side, the lower side forming a side region of said elongate strip or sheet. The label is characterised in that a region with a self-adhesive compound for reversible bonding is provided on one part of the front of the lower side, which region holds the label together in the folded state, but allows the label to be opened, pulled apart or opened out several times and to be folded together again to close it, an adhesive-free zone remaining next to the self-adhesive compound for reversible bonding, which zone serves as an indirect holding part in that, although said zone is covered by the folded-together label, it remains grippable at the side and serves the user as a holding part for opening.
