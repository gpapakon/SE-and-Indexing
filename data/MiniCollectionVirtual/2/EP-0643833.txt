<ABSTRACT>
A biosensor comprises a layer of dielectric material, at least a part of which is coupled to a biocompatible porous matrix containing immobilised biochemicals. The biosensor may be based on the principle of frustrated total reflection (FTR). Most conveniently, the porous matrix is a hydrogel, e.g. a hydrogel selected from the group consisting of polysaccharides, e.g. agarose, dextran, carrageenan, alginic acid, starch, cellulose, and derivatives thereof, e.g. carboxymethyl derivatives, xanthan gum, pectin, and a water-swellable organic polymer such as polyvinyl alcohol, polyacrylic acid, polyacrylamide, and polyethylene glycol.

<DESCRIPTION>
Title : Analytical DeviceThis invention relates to sensors, in particular to chemical or biochemical sensors having a dielectric surface layer, such as those based on the principle of frustrated total internal reflection.Many devices for the automatic determination of biochemical analytes in solution have been proposed in recent years. Typically, such devices (biosensors) include a sensitised coating layer which is located in the evanescent region of a resonant field. Detection of the analyte typically utilizes optical techniques such as, for example, surface plasmon resonance (SPR), and is based on changes in the thickness and/or refractive index of the coating layer resulting from interaction of that layer with the analyte. This causes a change, eg in the angular position of the resonance.One of the techniques which has been suggested for use in optical biosensors is frustrated total reflection. The principles of frustrated total reflection (FTR) are well- known; the technique is described, for example, by Bosacchi and Oehrle [Applied Optics (1982), 2JL, 2167-2173]. An FTR device for use in immunoassay is disclosed in US Patent 4,857,273 and comprises a cavity layer bounded on one side by the sample under investigation and on the other side by a spacer layer which in turn is mounted on a substrate. The substrate-spacer layer interface is irradiated with monochromatic radiation such that total reflection occurs, the associated evanescent field penetrating through the spacer layer. If the thickness of the spacer layer is correct and the incident parallel wave vector matches one of the resonant mode propagation constants, the total reflection is frustrated and radiation is coupled into the cavity layer. The cavity layer must be composed of material which has a higher refractive index than the spacer layer and which is transparent at the wavelength of the incident radiation. 

 More recently, FTR biosensors have been described [see, for example, PCT Patent Application WO 90/06503] in which the cavity layer is a thin film of relatively high refractive index material, typically an inorganic oxide.In all biosensors, it is necessary that the sensitised coating layer comprise a layer of immobilised chemical or biochemical species. It has recently been suggested, in connection with SPR sensors, that a biocompatible porous matrix such as a hydrogel be employed to achieve this immobilisation [see PCT Patent Application WO 90/05303]. The matrix typically comprises a dextran which is coupled to the sensor surface
