<ABSTRACT>
A logic gate is disclosed which includes a first 
logic gate circuit for generating an output signal 

representative of a function of two or more input 
signals. The present invention provides a NOR gate with 

a self-latching output, with minimal parts count and 
power consumption, which is suitable for use in a PAL 

system. 
Polarity option control logic is disclosed which 
provides an optimized design for a macrocell of a 

programmable logic array with a minimal parts count. 
Finally, an initialization circuit is disclosed 
which includes a latch circuit for providing a first 

stable output state immediately after the application of 
power thereto and a second stable output state at a 

certain delay on the application of power or when the 
power reaches a predetermined level.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a polarity option 
control logic for use with a register which may be used, 
for example in programmable logic arrays (PLAs) or more 
specifically, programmable array logic (PAL) circuits. While the present invention is described herein with 
reference to illustrative embodiments for particular 
applications, it should be understood that the invention is 
not limited thereto. Those having ordinary skill in the 
art and access to the teachings provided herein will 
recognize additional modifications, applications, and 
embodiments within the scope thereof and additional fields 
in which the present invention would be of significant 
utility. Programmable logic arrays provide "glue logic" for PC 
(printed circuit) boards. Glue logic is the logic required 
to interface two boards and generally includes a plurality 
of AND gates, OR gates and input/output I/O buffers. PLAs 
consume less space and therefore generally provide glue 
logic in a less costly manner than individual AND gates, OR 
gates and I/O buffers.  PLAs also offer the advantage of reconfigurability 
over discrete or individual gates. That is, PLAs generally 
include an array of "AND" gates, an array of "OR" gates, 
and some provision for interconnecting the outputs of 
selected AND gates to the inputs of selected OR gates PLAs 
allow a wide variety of logic functions to be implemented 
through the combination, via the OR gates, of the product 
terms, provided by the AND gates. Further, the 
configuration of the array may be quickly, easily and 
relatively inexpensively reprogrammed to implement other 
functions. As described in U.S. Patent No. 4,124,899, 
programmable array logic circuits were developed to provide 
further improvements in the speed, space requirements, cost 
and power consumption of PLAs. In a most general sense, a 
PAL provides a field programmable logic array in which a 
programmable array of circuit inputs are provided to a 
plurality of AND gates to generate product terms. Outputs 
from subgroups of AND gates are, in turn, nonprogrammably 
connected as inputs to individual, specified OR gates to 
provide the sum of products. Hence, PALs provide 
programmable AND and fixed OR functions relative to generic 
PLAs. More specifically, a typical PAL includes a plurality 
of input and output pads which are essentially connection 
areas and which facilitate the bonding of a first circuit 
to another circuit via the "glue logic" provided by the 
PAL. Each input pad is connected to an input buffer
