<DESCRIPTION>
 TIRE MOLD REINFORCEMENTTechnical Field This invention relates to methods and mold constructions for making molds of plastics, such as epoxy resin. These molds may be made by pouring uncured, liquid plastic epoxy resin over models in segmented shoes. The present invention is especially directed to the forming of epoxy resin molds for molding tires which have recesses in the tread surface which are formed by stand alone ribs in the surfaces of the molds. The segmented shoes are reusable and may be prefabricated with standard shoe split diameters and chord lengths to reduce the time necessary to make subsequent molds. Alignment and sealing of the shoe parts is provided. Background ArtAs shown in U.S. Patent No. 4,858,881, it has been proposed to make partial tire molds of epoxy or other resin to repair tire sidewalls. It has also been proposed to reinforce plastic articles with glass fibers, as shown in U.S. Patent No. 4, 692,291. U.S. Patent No. 5,449,483 uses modular shoe containers for making metal shells with a resin backing.The transfer of metal blades from slits in a matrix of rubber to a mold shell is described in U.S. Patent No. 2,275,582. The matrix is covered by an electro-formed metal shell which bonds to the blades so that upon removal of the matrix the blades become part of the metal mold shell. The mold shell must then be machined to become part of a tire mold. Disclosure of Invention In accordance with the method of this invention, a model of a segment of a tire having a tread configuration with recesses such as grooves, slots and slits in the model surface is mounted in a shoe having a chamber for receiving a plastic, such as uncured, liquid epoxy resin, to form a complete segment of the tire mold. Before filling the chamber with the uncured epoxy resin , the model is sprayed with a grease type spray release agent which does not react with the epoxy resin to retard its curing.In one embodiment of this invention a mixture of fiberglass and epoxy is sprayed on the surface of the model and into the recesses in the model surface to provide reinforced stand alone ribs in the tread molding surface of the epoxy resin mold after curing and removal of the mold from the model. In another embodiment, the mixture of uncured 

epoxy resin and fiberglass is formed in a semi-liquid putty-like consistency, and instead of spraying, this material is packed against the surface of the model to fill the recesses in the model surface. After the recesses are filled by packing the mixture of epoxy resin and
