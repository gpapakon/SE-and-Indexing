<ABSTRACT>
Biaxially oriented polypropylene films having a core layer 
of voided polypropylene homopolymer with a layer of non-voided 

polypropylene homopolymer on one surface thereof and 
an outer, printable layer on the non-voided layer, the core 

layer and/or the said non-voided layer including titanium 
dioxide. Such films can be used to produce labels, for 

example with densities in the range 0.55 to 0.80 despite 
the presence of the titanium dioxide.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention concerns polymeric films and especially polymeric
films for producing labels.The use of polymeric films to produce labels has been increasing
in recent years. Labels produced from polymeric films have a
number of advantages, for example compared with paper labels.
In particular labels produced from polymeric films can be
applied to articles by the so-called in-mold labelling technique
in which a pre-formed and usually pre-printed polymeric film
label is introduced into a mold prior to the article being
molded in the mold, for example by injection molding or blow
molding, so that the label forms an integral part of the surface
of the article.Self-adhesive labels produced from polymeric films have also
found wide acceptance, such labels often being presented on a
strip of material having a release surface from which the labels
can be peeled as required.A number of proposals have been made hitherto for the types of
polymeric films which can be used to form labels, biaxially
oriented films based on propylene polymers having found wide
acceptance for the purpose due to their inherent properties, for
example stiffness combined with printability and the ability to
adhere to molded polypropylene articles during in-mold labels
can be transparent or opaque, as desired.An example of a hitherto proposed opaque polypropylene film for
use in producing labels consists of a relatively thick core
layer of a voided propylene homopolymer with relatively thin
layers of a non-voided polymer on either side of the core layer,
voiding of the core having been achieved by biaxially stretching
the film with a phase-distinct particulate material, e.g. chalk,
in the core layer. The voids in the core provide these films 
with opacity, and the non-voided outer layers provide them with
printability and/or the ability to adhere to articles as the
articles are being molded. Such films are in essence identical
to packaging films as are proposed, for example, in EP0004633-A,
but they will usually be used at considerably greater
thicknesses. Thus whereas packaging films are often used at
thicknesses of about 30µm, films used for labelling are often in
excess of 50µm thick in order to achieve the desired stiffness
to facilitate application of the labels to articles which are to
be labelled.Although the use of a voiding agent does impart opacity to
voided films, the films are often not sufficiently opaque for
some end uses, for example in-mold labels on highly opaque
articles where it is desired that the background of a

A biaxially oriented polypropylene film comprising a core
layer of voided polypropylene homopolymer with a layer of

non-voided polypropylene homopolymer on one surface
thereof and an outer, printable layer of a polyolefin

containing units derived from two or more of ethylene,
propylene, but-1-ene and higher alpha-olefins on the non-voided

polypropylene homopolymer layer, and the surface of the
core layer opposite to the non-voided layer having at

least one further polymeric layer thereon the outer
surface of which being matt and comprising a blend of

incompatible polymers, the core layer and/or the said
non-voided layer including titanium dioxide.
A film according to claim 1, wherein the core layer
contains titanium dioxide and the said non-voided layer

is substantially free of titanium dioxide.
A film according to claim 1, wherein the said non-voided
layer contains titanium dioxide and the core layer is

substantially free of titanium dioxide.
A film according to any of the preceding claims, wherein
the titanium dioxide is present in the layer or layers in

which it is present in an amount of up to 20 percent by
weight of the layer in which it is present.
A film according to claim 4, wherein the titanium dioxide
is present in an amount of from 3 to 15 percent by weight

of the layer in which it is present.
A film according to any of the preceding claims, wherein
at least one outer surface has been treated to increase

the surface energy thereof.
