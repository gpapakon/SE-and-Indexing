<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to compositions of extended
hydraulic cements, that is cements which, upon mixing with
water set and harden to give substantial strength, and more
particularly to extended cement compositions exhibiting high
strength.The chemical parameters LSF, S/R and A/F referred to in this
specification are:.
Lime Saturation Factor (LSF) = CaO-0.7 SO32.8 SiO2+1.2 Al2O3+0.65 Fe2O3Silica Ratio (S/R) = SiO2Al2O3+Fe2O3Alumina Ratio (A/R) = Al2O3Fe2O3Sodium oxide equivalent (Na2Oeq) = 0.658·K2O + Na2OIn the foregoing ratios, the chemical symbols represent percentage
by weight of the identified substance present in the
composition. In the following description and claims the
percentages referred to are by weight.Four cement minerals are usually regarded as the major constituents
of Portland cement clinker: Alite which mainly
consists of tricalcium silicate (3CaO·SiO2) designated C3S,
belite which mainly consists of dicalcium silicate 
(2CaO·SiO2) designated C2S, tricalcium aluminate (3CaO.Al2O3)
designated C3A, and tetracalcium aluminate ferrite
(4CaO·Al2O3·Fe2O3) designated C4AF.Throughout this specification, the quantity of the main
clinker compounds have been calculated according to the Bogue
formulas, corrected for the presence of SO3 in the clinker
(F.M. Lea: "The Chemistry of Cement and Concrete." Edward
Arnold (Publishers) Ltd., London, p. 115-116). It is also
possible to determine the content of C3S directly by quantitative
X-ray diffraction, although it is necessary to apply a
correction allowing for the increased C3S content due to the
solid solution of Al, Fe, F, Mg, and other elements into the
C3S in order to obtain results that can be compared with the
C3S content calculated according to Bogue.A number of minor components such as MgO, TiO2, Mn2O3, K2O
and Na2O are present in the clinker although they usually do
not amount to more than a few percent of the cement. Two of
the minor components are of particular interest: sodium oxide
(Na2O) and potassium oxide (K2O) also known as the alkalies
(although other alkali metals also exist in cement). They
have been found to react with some aggregates by an expansive
reaction, the so-called alkali-aggregate reaction. The products
of this reaction may cause disintegration of the concrete,
and necessitate costly repair or even demolition of
structures.It has been found that expansion due to alkali-aggregate
reaction can be reduced or eliminated by the use of cement
with low alkali content. In several countries the use of
cement with high
