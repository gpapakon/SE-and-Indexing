<ABSTRACT>
A connector (10) is disclosed for interconnecting circuitry (12, 16) of two circuit boards (14, 18) which carry relatively high frequency signals. The receptacle connector (20) includes shield plates (56) between each adjacent pair of signal contacts (58) and the mating plug connector (24) includes a central elongated ground plate (136) that electrically engages each of the shield plates (56). The ground plate (136) includes a plurality of leads (142) along its length that engage ground pads on the circuit board (18). The plug connector (24) includes an outer shield (146) that substantially surrounds the plug connector (24) and includes leads (148) that are attached to the leads (142) of the elongated ground plate (136).

<DESCRIPTION>
 HIGH FREQUENCY ELECTRICAL CONNECTORThe present invention relates to electrical connectors for carrying high speed signals in the interconnection of electrical circuits on circuit boards and more particularly to such connectors having improved ground shielding.Electrical connectors for interconnecting circuitry on two circuit boards, typically in the computer and related industries, must be easily mountable to either the edge or surface of the circuit board, in many cases utilizing surface mount technology. Such connectors usually contain a relatively large number of pins for interconnecting signals and a fewer number of pins for interconnecting to ground. A typical prior art connector of this type, for example, is disclosed in United States Pat. No. 4,762,500 which issued August 9, 1988 to Dola et al . This connector includes an insulating housing having two rows of closely spaced signal contacts and a central ground plate that extend between the two rows of signal contacts. The connector is impedance matched as closely as its structure allows, however, it is limited to interconnecting signals having rise times of much less than 200 picoseconds. Further, this connector is relatively large having only 32 pins for signal interconnections. As the industry requires connectors having larger numbers of pins, due largely to increases in computer word length from 32 bits to 64 bits, to 128 bits and higher, necessarily these pins must be packed more closely together to remain within an acceptable overall package size. The electrical characteristics of the connector become more important as the connector is miniaturized to meet the current trend of the industry and as the speed of the signals that are being interconnected increase. Such an increase in speed results in various well known problems
