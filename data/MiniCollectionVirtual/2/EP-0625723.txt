<ABSTRACT>
An untreated substrate (42) is treated prior to use to 
induce a near-parallel orientation of a liquid crystal director 

relative to the untreated substrate (42). A layer (44) of silica 
is deposited on the untreated substrate (42) by in-line magnetron 

sputtering as the untreated substrate (42) is moved past the 
sputtering target, and the silica-coated substrate (42) is 

thereafter treated with an alcohol. The alcohol-treated substrate 
(20) is covered with a layer of the liquid crystal.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates generally to liquid
crystals, and, more particularly, to a substrate that pre-aligns
a liquid crystal layer.One type of liquid crystal electro-optical device is
constructed by placing a thin layer of liquid crystal between
two transparent plates that have each been coated
with a layer of an electrical conductor on its interior
face. When no electric field is applied (field-OFF) between
the conductive layers, the director of the liquid
crystal is in one state. (The "director" of the liquid
crystal is the average macroscopic direction of the long
molecular axis of the liquid crystal molecules.) When an
electric field is applied (field-ON), the director reorients
to another state. Because the liquid crystal is birefringent,
the two states will have different refractive
indices, and in many cases the thin layer of liquid crystal
will be birefringent for light directed against the transparent
plates. The state change responsive to an applied
electric field is the basis for liquid crystal devices that
control light, such as displays and liquid crystal light
valves used in projectors.In its usual form, a liquid crystal light valve is a
device that modulates a polarized projection light beam
directed against one side of the light valve according to 
a writing light beam directed against the other side. The
polarized projection light beam enters the light valve
through one of the transparent electrodes, usually termed
the counterelectrode, passes through the liquid crystal
layer, and is reflected from a mirror on the other electrode.
The projection light beam passes back through the
liquid crystal layer and the counterelectrode, and through
an external analyzer. The polarizing and analyzing functions
can often be accomplished by a single polarizing beam
splitter through which the projection light beam passes before
and after passing through the liquid crystal. The
operation of this and other types of liquid crystal light
valves is discussed in greater detail in numerous technical
publications; see, for example, "Progress in Liquid Crystal
Light Valves", by W.P. Bleha, in Laser Focus/Electro-Optics,
October 1983, pages 111-120.In this type of liquid crystal light valve, an electric
bias field is applied through the liquid crystal layer
by a voltage on the conductive electrodes. The liquid
crystal is oriented responsive to this electric bias field.
The director of the liquid crystal is initially, in the
electric field OFF state, aligned perpendicular to the
plates. Application of the
