<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates generally to mixtures of polymers and 
iodonium photoacid generators or non-ionic triflic acid generators used 
in resist compositions and, more specifically, to improved photoresist 
compositions for use in printed circuit board manufacture which function 
via an acid-catalyzed deprotection mechanism. More particularly, 
multifunctional organic carboxylic acids are employed in the compositions 
of the present invention to substantially reduce, if not entirely 
eliminate undevelopable resist and aid in the strippability of the 
resist. The design of chemically amplified resist systems based on acid-catalyzed 
chain reactions (e.g., polymerization, depolymerization, side 
chain cleavage, etc.) has been recognized as a viable route to high 
sensitivity resist systems in microlithography. Such systems are 
described in, e.g., Polymers In Electronics, Davidson T. Ed., ACS 
Symposium Series 242, American Chemical Society, Washington, D.C., 1984, 
page 11, H. Ito, C.G. Willson. These systems offer the high sensitivity 
attendant with chemical amplification but avoid the drawbacks of free 
radical based systems. Systems of this type are capable of high 
resolution, i.e., submicron in the case of semiconductor applications. 
Since they are oxygen insensitive, they can be applied in liquid form as 
thin films. Photoresists which function via an acid-catalyzed deprotection 
mechanism utilize polymers which are positive acting. That is, the 
unexposed resist is insoluble in the developer, but is converted into a 
soluble material upon exposure. Chemically, this is accomplished by 
changing the side group chemistry through thermal cleavage, a reaction 
which is acid-catalyzed. Compounds such as iodonium salts generate acid 
upon photo or thermally induced decomposition. These materials are 
typically sensitized to the desired wavelengths with an appropriate dye. However, the use of iodonium salts and non-ionic triflic acid 
generators in positive acting photoresists on copper surfaces has been 
impractical due to the formation of an undevelopable layer of resist at 
the copper surface in the exposed regions. Additionally, photoresists 
have often proved difficult to strip in standard basic aqueous solutions  
 
such as sodium hydroxide. Attempts to overcome these problems have 
included copper passivation methods, such as electroless chrome or nickel 
treatments, or the use of alternative photoacid generators, such as 
sulfonium salts. Unfortunately, the copper passivation methods were
