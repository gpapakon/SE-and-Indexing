<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a cabinet with positive locking for at least one door (14,16) which is articulated pivotably on a cabinet frame (12). Arranged in the region of a door edge (20) is at least one opening (42), the axis of which lies essentially parallel to the plane of the door and through which at least one snap-action bolt (26), fastened on the cabinet frame (12) and prestressed in the direction of the door (14,16), of a bolt mechanism (24) can penetrate in the closed position of the door. Further provided are an opening mechanism (22) and a linkage (32,34) which can be actuated by the opening mechanism (22) and can be actuated counter to the snap-action bolt (26), penetrating the opening (42), in order to release the engagement of the snap-action bolt (26) into the opening (42).

<CLAIMS>
A universal or tool cupboard for mounting in a motor 
vehicle, with positive interlocking for at least one 

door (14, 16) which is articulated pivotably on the 
cupboard frame (12) in the region of a first door 

edge (18), 

with a bolt mechanism (24) in the region of a 
second, opposite door edge (20), the said bolt mechanism 

having at least one orifice (42) which is 
arranged in the region of the second door edge (20) 

and the axis of which is essentially parallel to the 
door plane and through which at least one snap bolt 

(26), fastened to the cupboard frame (12) and prestressed 
in the direction of the door (14, 16), can 

pass when the door (14, 16) is in the closed position, 
the snap bolt (26) having, at its free end, at 

least one inclined ramp (44), by means of which it 
is deflected when the door (14) is being closed, and 
with an opening mechanism (22) and with a linkage 
(32, 34) which can be actuated by the opening mechanism 

(22) and which can be actuated against the 
snap bolt (26) passing through the orifice (42), in 

order to release the engagement of the snap bolt 
(26) into the orifice (42), 
 
characterized in that 


there are arranged on the cupboard frame (12), in 
the region of the two ends of the second door edge 

(20), two bolt mechanisms, the snap bolts (26) of 
which pass through corresponding orifices (42) in 

transverse struts (38, 40) of the door (14), and  
 
the opening mechanism (22) contains a rotatable 
disc (30), on which two rods (32, 34) are articulated 

at an equal distance from the axis of 
rotation, the rotary disc (30) being prestressed 

resiliently into a closing position, in which the 
rods (32, 34) do not bear on the snap bolts (26) of 

the bolt mechanisms (24), and 
the snap bolt (26) is provided with a shorter ramp 
(46), so that the door can be opened as soon as the 

snap bolt (26) is forced back until the transverse 
strut (38, 40) of the door can push the snap bolt 

(26) back completely. 
Cupboard according to claim 2, characterized in that 
a door-lock interlock (36), by means of which the 

rotary disc is held in its closing position, is 
provided. 
Cupboard according to claim 2, characterised in that 
the door-lock interlock contains a longitudinally 

displaceable cylindrical pin which, in the closed 
position, passes through a recess or orifice in the 

rotary disc. 
Cupboard according to any one of the preceding 
claims, characterized in that the snap bolt (26) is 

shaped conically at its free end.
