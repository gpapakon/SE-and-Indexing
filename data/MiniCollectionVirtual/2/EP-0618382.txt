<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an auxiliary
transmission section for a compound transmission and,
more particularly, to an improved auxiliary transmission
section including a planetary gear set for defining
selectable torque flow paths between the auxiliary
section input and output shafts.Compound change gear transmissions of the type
having one or more auxiliary sections connected in
series with a main transmission section are well known
in the prior art. Briefly, by utilizing main and
auxiliary transmission sections connected in series,
assuming proper sizing of the ratio steps, the total of
available transmission ratios is equal to the product of
the main and auxiliary section ratios. By way of
example, at least in theory, a compound change gear
transmission comprising a three (3) speed main section
connected in series with a four (4) speed auxiliary
section will provide twelve (3x4=12) available ratios.Auxiliary transmission sections are of three
general types: range type, splitter type or combined
range/splitter type.In compound transmissions having a range type
auxiliary section, the ratio step or steps may be
greater, equal or less than the total ratio coverage of 
the main transmission section and the main section is
shifted progressively through its ratios in each range.
Examples of compound transmissions having range type
auxiliary sections may be seen by reference to U.S.
Patent Nos. 3,105,395; 2,637,222 and 2,637,221.In compound transmissions having a splitter
type auxiliary section, the ratio steps of the splitter
auxiliary section are less than the ratio steps of the
main transmission section and each main section ratio is
split, or subdivided, by the splitter section. Examples
of compound change gear transmissions having splitter
type auxiliary sections may be seen by reference to U.S.
Patent Nos. 4,290,515; 3,799,002; 4,440,037 and
4,527,447.In a combined range and splitter type auxiliary
section, or sections, both range and splitter type
ratios are provided allowing the main section to be
progressively shifted through its ratios in at least two
ranges and also allowing the main section ratios to be
split in at least one range.One example of a compound transmission having
a single combined range/splitter type auxiliary section
may be seen by reference to U.S. Patent Nos. 3,283,613;
3,648,546,
and to publication Small Scale Print
No. 016-AD; Fuller Transmissions; Models RT-14613, RTO-14613,
