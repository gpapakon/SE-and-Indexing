<ABSTRACT>
Disclosed is a process for the preparation of 
native human glicentin, which comprises producing by 

recombinant gene technology a fused polypeptide composed of 
human glicentin having an extra peptide moiety linked to the 

amino terminus and cleaving the extra peptide moiety in the 
fused polypeptide, wherein the peptide moiety upon cleavage 

is designed to constitute even-numbered amino acids and the 
cleavage of the extra peptide moiety is carried out by 

hydrolysis with cathepsin C. T7S10 peptide is used as the 
peptide moiety.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a process for the 
preparation of native human glicentin useful for 
pharmaceutical applications such as antidiabetics. Glicentin is a gastrointestinal peptide hormone 
composed of 69 amino acids, plays an important role in the 
physiology of gastrointestines and is used as 
pharmaceuticals, e.g., antidiabetics as disclosed in 
Japanese Patent Kokai 4-185066 (corresponding to EPA 
0586812). Glicentin was isolated and purified from porcine 
small intestine for the first time by F. Sundby et al [F. 
Sundby, et al., Horm. Metab. Res. Vol. 18, 366-371 (1976)] 
and its structure was then identified by A. Thim and A. J. 
Moody [A. Thim and A. J. Moody, Regul. Pept. Vol. 2, 139-150 
(1981)]. Afterward, the structures of glicentin genes from 
human and several animal species were elucidated. As a 
result, it was revealed that the amino acid sequence of 
human glicentin is distinct from that of other animal 
species. Because of difficult availability of human organs, 
human glicentin has never been isolated or purified. It is considered that methods for the production 
of glicentin include a method for the extraction from animal 
organs and a method by chemical synthesis. The above  
 
extraction method requires a great deal of such organs, 
because of the glicentin content in animal oragns being 
quite low. It is possible to isolate and purify glicentin 
from such organs as porcine ones that are abundantly 
available. However, the resultant purified glicentin is 
peculiar to the animal species and different from human 
glicentin. Extraction from human organs is not feasible 
because of their availability being almost impossible. The 
method by chemical synthesis cannot provide glicentin in 
large quantities at low price, since the reaction yield is 
low due to its long amino acid sequence and expensive 
reagents are used. We have previously developed a technique of 
preparing human glicentin which comprises cultivating a 
microorganism transformed with a vector having a synthetic 
DNA inserted thereinto which codes for the human 
glicentin amino acid sequence (see, "Proceedings of the 
Thirteenth Gut Hormone Conference", edited by JAPANESE 
SOCIETY OF GUT HORMONES and published by IGAKU TOSHO SHUPPAN 
LTD. in 1992, Vol. 11, pp. 394-401). However, the resultant 
glicentin contains additional methionine at the amino 
terminus, which is different from native glicentin. In the production of the protein by recombinant 
gene technology, there is prepared a peptide containing 
additional

A process of claim 1 wherein the amino acid number 
of the peptide moiety upon cleavage is rendered even by the 

construction of a gene encoding the following amino acid 
sequence 

 
wherein Met stands for methionine encoded by the translation 

initiation codon ATG and A stands for a peptide consisting 
of an even number of amino acids, the amino terminus of

threonine to produce the fused polypeptide, by which the 

amino terminal methionine is removed through processing by a 
producing strain. 
A process of claim 1 wherein the amino acid number

construction of a gene encoding the following amino acid 
sequence 

 
wherein Met is as defined in claim 4 and B stands for either 

an amino acid selected from arginine, asparagine, aspartic 
acid, glutamine, glutamic acid, isoleucine, leucine, lysine, 

tryptophan, tyrosine, phenylalanine or hystidine, or a 
peptide consisting of an odd number of amino acid, the amino 

terminus of which is selected from arginine, asparagine, 
aspartic acid, glutamine, glutamic acid, isoleucine, 

leucine, lysine, tryptophan, tyrosine, phenylalanine or 
histidine to produce the fused polypeptide, by which the 

amino terminal methionine is not removed through processing 
by a producing strain.
