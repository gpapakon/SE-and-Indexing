<ABSTRACT>
In order to measure a flow of a gas or a liquid, means are provided for converting this flow into a flow which is radial with respect to a central axis (M), and two sensors (10 and 20) are provided which respectively have two temperature-sensitive resistance devices (2 and 4 or 6 and 8, respectively) arranged one behind another in the radial flow. The four resistance devices (2, 4, 6 and 8) each have the form of circular segments about the central axis (M) and are connected to form a Wheatstone bridge in such a way that resistance devices (2 and 6 or 4 and 8, respectively) arranged downstream and upstream alternate with one another. As a result, a measuring device with a high measurement sensitivity is produced.
