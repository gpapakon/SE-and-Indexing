<ABSTRACT>
A device for recovering energy, in particular potential energy in working machines, has a hydraulically actuatable working cylinder (3) linked to a hydropneumatic storage (4). At least another working cylinder (5) is provided, the working cylinders (3, 5) are mutually linked by their rods so as to transfer fluid and are linked to a hydraulic circuit having at least one pump, and the other working cylinder (5) is also linked at its piston side to a hydraulic circuit having a pump, so that the energy generated by the movements of the working machine can be profitably stored in a failure-proof manner and called back again at defined moments in time.

Device for recovering energy, especially positional energy
in processing machines, with a hydraulically operated working

cylinder (3), which can be connected to a hydropneumatic
accumulator (4), in which case at least one further working

cylinder (5) is present and the respective working cylinders (3,
5) are connected to each other at the rod end in a manner

carrying fluid and are connected to a hydraulic circuit, which
comprises at least one pump, and in which case the respective

further working cylinder (5) is connected at the piston side
likewise to a hydraulic circuit with a pump, characterised in

that the piston chamber (32) of the hydraulic working cylinder
(3) is connected to the hydropneumatic accumulator (4) by way of

a seated valve (61), in particular in the form of a cartridge
valve, which cooperates with a control distributor (62), which

as part of a control device (65) is connected to a pressure relay
(63), and that the control device (65) is connected by its

control input (64) to a low pressure branch (13), which
cooperates with the movable parts of the processing machine, in

particular in the form of an arm (2).
Device according to Claim 1, characterised in that a
switching device is located between the piston chamber (32) of

the working cylinder (3) connected to the accumulator (4) and the
accumulator (4).
Device according to Claim 1 or 2, characterised in that
connected between the piston chamber (32) of the working cylinder

(3), which is connected to the accumulator (4), and the latter
is a change-over device, which comprises a tank connection.
Device according to Claims 2 and 3, characterised in that
the switching device and the change-over device are connected

hydraulically in series one after the other.
Device according to one of Claims 1 to 4, characterised
in that the piston chamber (32) of the working cylinder (3)

connected to the accumulator (4) is connected by means of a 
fluid-carrying line to the piston chambers (52) of the other

working cylinders (5), in which a non-return valve (14) is
connected.
Device according to Claim 5, characterised in that the
non-return valve (14) is connected in series with a restrictor

member (15), that a branch line (12) is connected using a further
non-return valve (11) in the line between the accumulator (4) and

the piston chamber (32) connected thereto, which is part of the
hydraulic circuit, and that the branch line (12) is further

connected to a liquid container (9) by way of a non-return valve
(10).
Device according to Claim 6, characterised in that
provided between a tank connection (T) of the control distributor

(62) and the piston chamber (32) of the cylinder (3) connected
to the accumulator (4) is a two-way valve (16), whereof the

output is connected to a supply line (P) of the control
distributor (62), whereas the tank connection (T) of the control

distributor (62) is connected to the communicating piston rod
chambers (31 and 51) of the working cylinders (3 or 5), which are

in turn connected to a hydraulic operating cylinder (17).
