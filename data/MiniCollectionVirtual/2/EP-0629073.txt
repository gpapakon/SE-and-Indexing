<ABSTRACT>
A facsimile apparatus having an original conveying 
mechanism, a recording mechanism and a paper feeding 

mechanism each of which need not be provided with its 
own drive motor. Cost, size and weight are reduced by 

providing the minimum required number of motors. To 
this end, the facsimile apparatus is provided with a 

reading unit for reading an image of an original, an 
original conveying mechanism for conveying the original 

to the reading unit, a recording unit for recording a 
prescribed image on a recording sheet, a recording-sheet 

conveying unit for conveying the recording sheet to the 
recording uni, and control means for selectively driving 

the original conveying mechanism and the recording-sheet 
conveying mechanism in prescribed fashion by a common 

drive motor, thereby conveying the original and the 
recording sheet.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a facsimile apparatus
constructed to have an internal mechanism for conveying
originals and sheets of recording paper of a prescribed
size.Facsimile machines, which have recently gained
popularity even in the home, are now required to have
more sophisticated features. One such feature is the
ability for such machines to use ordinary paper (paper
sheets of a standard size such as size A4, hereinafter
referred to as "cut sheets" or "recording sheets")
instead of thermosensitive paper in the form of a roll,
which heretofore has been the type of paper used most
widely. Another feature is the ability to feed the
recording sheets automatically. Facsimile machines of
this more sophisticated type are gradually becoming
dominant. It should be noted that the term "recording
sheet" used here refers to a medium that is not limited
to paper.The components of a facsimile apparatus using such
cut sheets include, as elements requiring motor drive,
original conveying means for conveying an original to a
reader, recording means for recording an image on a 
recording paper (sheet), and paper feeding means for
separating recording paper one sheet at a time and
feeding the recording paper into the recording means.
In order to drive each of these means in a prescribed
manner, the conventional facsimile apparatus generally
is so constructed that the original conveying means,
recording means and paper feeding means are each
provided with a drive motor (stepping motor), a drive
circuit and a driving power-supply unit, which are
controlled individually.In accordance with an arrangement provided with
drive motors for respective ones of the original
conveying means, recording means and paper feeding
means, as in the above-described facsimile apparatus
according to the prior art, the cost of the facsimile
apparatus is high owing to the comparatively expensive
drive motors as well as the motor drive circuits and
supply power sources for these motors. In addition,
since space is needed in order to install the necessary
number of drive motors, it is difficult to make the
facsimile apparatus small in size.In the transmitting/receiving mode, which is the
mode ordinarily used in a facsimile apparatus, control
can be carried out in such a manner that the operation
for reading an original and the recording operation will 
not be performed simultaneously. In the copy mode, in
which a desired original is copied on a recording sheet,
it is necessary that the sheet recording operation be
performed at the same time as

<CLAIMS>
A facsimile apparatus having reading means (19) for reading an image of
an original (G), original conveying means (16, 17, 18) for conveying the

original to said reading means (19), recording means (9) for recording an
image on a cut recording sheet (S), and recording sheet conveying means (5,

8) for conveying the recording sheet to the recording means (9),

drive motor means (32, 34);
and equipped with receiving, transmitting and copying functions,
a recording sheet supply means (3) for supplying the cut recording sheet
(S) to the entrance port of said recording sheet conveying means (5, 8),

recording sheet storage means (1) for stacking a plurality of the recording
sheets (S), each cut recording sheet having a predetermined size and being

supplied to said entrance port of said recording sheet conveying means (5,
8), after being picked up in a sheet-by-sheet fashion by said recording

sheet supply means (3);

characterized by

copy-mode control means for performing control in such a manner that
copying is carried out by simultaneously performing a reading operation for

reading of the original (G) by said reading means and a recording operation
for recording by said recording means,
wherein said drive motor means comprise
a first drive motor (34) for driving said recording sheet conveying means
(5, 8), 
and a second drive motor (32) which is used to drive alternately
said original conveying means (5, 8) and said recording sheet supply

means (3) so as to enable said simultaneous reading and recording in the copy mode.
The apparatus according to claim 1, further comprising

a rocking mechanism (33) meshing with a power transmission mechanism
(WI-WII) of said original conveying means or a power transmission

mechanism (WP1, WP2, W20-W22) of said recording sheet supply means

(32) in order to drive said original conveying means or said recording sheet
supply means by said second drive motor.
The apparatus according to claim 1, wherein

two one way clutches (41a, 44a) are provided, one for transmitting power
to a power transmission mechanism of said original conveying means and

the other for transmitting power to a transmission mechanism of said
recording sheet supply means in accordance with the direction of rotation

of said second drive motor (32) in order to drive said original conveying
means or said recording sheet supply means by said second drive motor

(32).
The apparatus according to claim 1, further comprising

an actuator (47a) for moving a drive gear (32a) of said second drive motor
