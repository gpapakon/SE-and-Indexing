<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a process for
producing chromans.Chromans are useful as intermediate products for
bioactive substances such as tocopherols and pharmaceuticals
and for polymeric materials including engineering resins and
as stabilizers for organic substances such as fats, oils and
synthetic resins.Known processes for producing chromans are as follows.This process comprises effecting ring closing of an
allyl compound obtained by reacting a phenol with an allyl
halide, allyl alcohol or a diolefine. See, for example,
"DAIYUKIKAGAKU, Vol. 14 Heterocyclic Compounds I, pages 215-217".

wherein X represents a halogen atom.This process comprises heating a mixture of o-oxybenzyl 
alcohol and an unsaturated compound with no solvent at a
temperature of 180 to 220째C. See, for example,
"DAIYUKIKAGAKU, Vol. 14 Heterocyclic Compounds I, page 220".It is considered that, by this process, there forms an
intermediate of the dehydrated product of o-oxybenzyl
alcohol, which then undergoes Diels-Alder reaction with the
unsaturated compound. The yield is about 50%.
The process comprises oxidizing o-[1-(alkylthio)alkyl]phenol
with silver oxide under a mild condition, and
reacting the oxidized product with a vinyl ether, to obtain
a chroman. See, for example, Bull. Chem. Soc. Jpn., 63(4),
1062 (1990).
This process comprises reacting a phenol, formaldedyde
and unsaturated compound in a solvent of a hydrocarbon or an
aromatic halogenized compound at a temperature of 160 to 
250째C, to obtain a chroman. See, for example, Japanese
Patent Application Laid-open No. 92283/1985.

However, the above known processes have the following
problems.That is, the process (1) sometimes cannot produce a
chroman depending on the substituent present on the allyl
compound or diolefin used and generally leads to a low
yield. The process (2), for which it is difficult to
produce o-oxybenzyl alcohol in a high yield, is not suitable
for commercial production. The reaction of the process (3),
which uses a special compound as a starting material and
requires an equimolar amount of silver oxide for oxidizing
phenol, is also unsuitable for industrial application. The
process (4) gives a low yield of 10 to 50%.Accordingly, an object of the present invention is to
solve the above problems associated with the prior art and
to provide chromans in a high yield and by an industrially
simple and easy process.The present inventors have found that reaction of a
phenol and an unsaturated compound, both being readily
available at a low cost, can give
