<ABSTRACT>
A mutant fungal strain, namely (G. candidum) NRRL Y-552, mutant known as Henkel 9-2-3-9 produces a lipase called "UNLipase" providing a selectivity of 25:1 for oleic acid over palmitic acid by the assay procedure employed. UNLipase has a temperature range of operation of between 0 and 40 degrees Celsius (and no activity over 55 degrees Celsius). The optimum pH ranges are between 7.5 and 8.5. Magnesium cations increase activity, whereas calcium cations are inhibitory. The molecular weight of the protein appears to be 65 kDa by size exclusion chromatography. UNLipase shows a high degree of selectivity for hydrolysis, esterification and transesterification.

<DESCRIPTION>
 ENZYMES PRODUCED BY MUTANTS OF GEOTRICHUM CΑNDIDIABACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION1. Field of the InventionThe present invention relates to a novel mutant strain of Geotrichum candidum and a novel lipase produced by that strain, UNLipase which selectively hydrolyzes oleic acid esters at superior rates over other saturated and unsaturated fatty acid esters, such as palmitoleic, and stearic esters.2. Background of the Invention Glyceride cleavage is typically performed in industry using high-temperature steam treatment which does not discriminate between saturated and unsaturated fatty acid or fatty acid chain length. The use of enzymes, particularly lipases, as catalysts for efficient glyceride splitting at mild, low energy-demanding conditions would offer many economic advantages over these prior methods. The use of a selective lipase for the preparation of high purity oleic acid from fats or oils containing low levels of oleic acid would offer additional economic advantages over these prior methods. 

A. Lipases, GenerallyLipases are a group of enzymes belonging to the esterases, and are also called glyceroester hydrolases or acylglycerol-acylhydrolases. These enzymes hydrolyze fat and oils (present in ester form, such as glycerides) , yielding the base components of glycerol and fatty acids. These enzymes also catalyze digestion. Lipases are widely found throughout the plant and animal worlds, including molds, bacteria, milk and milk products, and animal tissues such as the pancreas. Lipases have been widely used to split fats without damaging sensitive constituents, such as vitamins or unsaturated fatty acids. (The Merck Index, p. 868) .Lipases generally have two types of specificity, positional specificity and fatty acid specificity. Positional specificity or regiospecificity permits some lipases to split the ester bonds at particular positions on the triglyceride backbone. Asperαillus niqer lipases display this type of specificity. Hata et al., J. Biochem. 86:6, 1821-1827 (1986). Pancreatic lipase and Pseudomonas fra i lipase reportedly attack triglycerides at the 1-, 3- positions. Alford et al., JAOCS 42, 1038-40 (1961). An ideal lipase for total fat splitting would have the following properties: 1) broad substrate specificities, 2) no significant interferences, 3) high specific activity, 4) a degree of hydrolysis of 100%.Fatty acid specificity is displayed by lipases which indiscriminately split all of the ester bonds. Certain amounts of fatty acid specificity have been found in some Geotrichum
