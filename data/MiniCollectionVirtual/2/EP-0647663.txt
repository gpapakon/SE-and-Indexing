<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to thermoplastic elastomers based on vinyl chloride graft copolymers, containing   A)from 35 to 60% by weight based on the total weight of the vinyl chloride graft copolymer, of a grafted-on, crosslinked copolymer phase obtainable by copolymerisation of     from 80 to 99.95% by weight of vinyl chloride, from 0.05 to 3.0% by weight of polyethylenically unsaturated comonomers and from 0 to 19.95% by weight of further copolymerisable, ethylenically unsaturated comonomers,  or from 35 to 60% by weight, based on the total weight of the vinyl chloride graft copolymer, of a grafted-on (co)polymer phase obtainable by (co)polymerisation of     from 80 to 100% by weight of vinyl chloride and from 0 to 20% by weight of further copolymerisable, ethylenically unsaturated comonomers,  at a polymerisation temperature of from 0 to 45 DEG C, and B) from 40 to 65% by weight, based on the total weight of the vinyl chloride graft copolymer, of a crosslinked graft base containing a crosslinked acrylate copolymer containing from 0.01 to 5% by weight of polyethylenically unsaturated comonomer units and optionally further comonomers which can be copolymerised with acrylates.

Thermoplastic elastomers based on vinyl chloride 
graft copolymers comprising 


A) 35 to 60% by weight, based on the total weight of 
the vinyl chloride graft copolymer, of a grafted-on, 

crosslinked copolymer phase which can be prepared by 
copolymerization of
 
80 to 99.95% by weight of vinyl chloride,
 
0.05 to 3.0% by weight of polyethylenically unsaturated 

comonomers and
 
0 to 19.95% by weight of other copolymerizable, 

ethylenically unsaturated comonomers,
 
or
 
more than 35 to 60% by weight, based on the total 

weight of the vinyl chloride graft copolymer, of a 
grafted-on (co)polymer phase which can be prepared 

by (co)polymerization of
 
80 to 100% by weight of vinyl chloride and
 
0 to 20% by weight of other copolymerizable, ethylenically 

unsaturated comonomers at a polymerization 
temperature of 0 to 45°C,
 
and 
B) 40 to 65% by weight, based on the total weight of 
the vinyl chloride graft copolymer, of a crosslinked 

graft base comprising
 
a crosslinked acrylic acid ester copolymer having 

0.01 to 5% by weight of polyethylenically unsaturated 
comonomer units and, if appropriate, other 

comonomers which can be copolymerized with acrylic 
acid esters. 
Thermoplastic elastomers based on vinyl chloride 
graft copolymers comprising 


A) 40 to 55% by weight, based on the total weight of 
the graft copolymer, of a grafted-on, crosslinked 

copolymer phase of
 
98.5 to 99.9% by weight of vinyl chloride and
 
0.1 to 1.5% by weight of one or more polyethylenically 

unsaturated comonomers from the group consisting 
of diallyl phthalate, allyl methacrylate,  

 
ethylene glycol dimethacrylate, butylene glycol 

diacrylate, trimethylene glycol diacrylate and trimethyolpropane 
[sic]
 triacrylate,
 
or
 
more than 40 to 55% by weight, based on the total 

weight of the vinyl chloride graft copolymer, of a 
grafted-on VC polymer phase which can be prepared by 

grafting polymerization of vinyl chloride at a 
polymerization temperature of 0 to 45°C,
 
and 
B) 45 to 60% by weight, based on the total weight of 
the graft copolymer, of a crosslinked graft base 

comprising a crosslinked copolymer of n-butyl 
acrylate and/or 2-ethylhexyl acrylate, or a cross-linked 

acrylic acid ester/ethylene/vinyl acetate 
copolymer having an acrylate content of 35 to 70% by 

weight, or mixtures of the copolymers mentioned, the 
copolymers being crosslinked with 0.05 to 0.5% by 

weight of one or more copolymerized, polyethylenically 
unsaturated comonomers from the group consisting 

of diallyl phthalate, allyl methacrylate, 
ethylene glycol dimethacrylate, butylene glycol diacrylate, 

trimethylene glycol diacrylate and trimethyolpropane 
[sic]
 triacrylate. 
Process for the preparation of the thermoplastic 
elastomers according to Claim 1 or 2, in which, in a 1st 

stage, 

a) one or more acrylic acid esters of alcohols having 
1 to 12 C atoms or 
b) one or more acrylic acid esters of alcohols having 
1 to 12 C atoms and one or more vinyl esters of 

carboxylic acids having 2 to 12 C atoms 
 
are copolymerized, while forcing in ethylene, by free 

radical polymerization by the emulsion polymerization 
process in an aqueous medium,
 
the copolymerization being carried out in the presence of 

0.05 to 5% by weight, based on the total monomer phase, 
of polyethylenically unsaturated comonomers, if appropriate 

in the presence of other copolymerizable,  
 

ethylenically unsaturated comonomers,
 
and, in a 2nd stage, a monomer mixture comprising 80 

to 99.95% by weight of vinyl chloride, 0.05 to 3.0% by 
weight of polyethylenically unsaturated comonomers and 0 

to 19.95% by weight of other copolymerizable, ethylenically 
unsaturated comonomers,
 
or, in this 2nd stage, at a polymerization temperature of 

0 to 45°C, 80 to 100% by weight of vinylchloride and 0 to 
20% by weight of other copolymerizable, ethylenically 

unsaturated comonomers,
 
are copolymerized in the presence of the emulsions 

obtained after the first process stage, or mixtures of 
these emulsions, by free radical polymerization by the 

suspension or emulsion polymerization process in an 
aqueous medium,
 
and, after working up to give the dry graft copolymer, 

this is compounded, if appropriate, with the additives 
customary for thermoplastic elastomers. 
Use of the thermoplastic elastomers according to 
Claim 1 or 2 for the production of elastic shaped 

articles by means of extrusion, calendering or injection 
moulding. 
Use of the thermoplastic elastomers according to 
Claim 1 or 2 as impact modifiers.
