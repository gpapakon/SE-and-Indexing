<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to lead-free 
alloys for use in soldering. More particularly, the 
present invention relates to a lead-free solder 
composition comprising tin, zinc, indium and bismuth. Different solder compositions have unique 
characteristics which make them suitable for particular 
applications. Two characteristics of a solder which 
are important to its use are melting temperature and 
melting range. Melting temperature is one of the most 
important characteristics of a solder. The solder 
chosen for a particular use should have a low enough 
melting temperature that the melted solder does not 
damage any temperature-sensitive components that are to 
be joined. However, the melting temperature should 
also be high enough that the joint formed will not be 
affected by the operating temperature of the device or 
by subsequent soldering operations. In modern 
electronic applications, the temperature sensitivity of 
microelectronic components requires the use of solders 
at relatively low temperatures. In comparison, solders 
for joining and sealing pipes in plumbing operations 
are generally applied at much higher working  
 
temperatures because the components are not so 
temperature sensitive. Another important characteristic of a solder 
is melting range. Pure elemental metals have a melting 
point. Most alloys, however, with the exception of 
eutectic compositions, melt over a range of 
temperatures. The alloy begins to melt at a 
temperature called the solidus but is not completely 
liquid until it reaches a higher temperature called the 
liquidus. The range between the solidus and the 
liquidus is referred to as the phase transformation 
range or "pasty" range. At temperatures within the 
"pasty" range, the alloy contains a mixture of solid 
and liquid phases containing different metal 
compositions. The solid phase contains higher melting 
point components and the liquid phase lower melting 
point components. Separation of the two components, 
called liquation, can alter the chemical composition of 
the alloy and the physical characteristics of the 
resulting joint. Liquation can be particularly problematic in 
automated soldering operations in which components, 
such as circuit boards, are transported by a conveyer 
belt through the soldering apparatus. After the solder 
has been applied by a process such as a wave soldering, 
the conveyor carries the components into a cooling 
zone. As the soldered joints cool, the solder 
solidifies. If a solder with a large "pasty" range is
