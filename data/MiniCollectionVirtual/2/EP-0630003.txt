<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to disc reproducing apparatus
with a track jump control for use, e.g., in compact disc
(CD) players.As is well known, a disc reproducing device for CD
players, video disc players and the like has a so-called
search function whereby a desired portion of the disc
can be searched based on a signal of recorded data.This search function is performed by causing a pickup
for reading the data signal recorded on the disc to move
in the radial direction of the disc at high speeds, or
to jump over the tracks.A track jump system of this type includes those
disclosed in Japanese Patent Unexamined Publications
Nos. 89282/1987, 276133/1986, 152565/1984, and
171080/1984. The control circuit of Application
276133/1986 is acknowledged in the pre-characterizing
portion of Claim 1 hereof.The track jump system disclosed in the latter two
patent publications performs the track jump function by
counting the track signal recorded on the disc.However, this type of system may sometimes not allow
track detection with shorter track jump times because
the frequency of traversing or jumping over the tracks
nears that of the recording frequency. Any defects or
strains also hamper correct reading of track signals,
thereby leading to errors in counting the number of
tracks. Vibrations to the device itself, inducing an
out-of-focus error, may also result in erroneous counts.Both Japanese Patent Unexamined Publications Nos.
89282/1987 and 276133/1986 disclose a track jump system
based principally on the linear motor system. The same 
applies to copending EP-A-0357044 and EP-A-0356939,
relevant only under EPC Art. 54(3).However, restrictions on the installation position
of the motor are the problem associated with this type
of system. Use of the linear motor in the position in
which gravitational acceleration is applied to the
direction of movement of the motor entails unnecessary
dissipation. Application of a balancing load is not a
solution because it increases the load output, which is
not economical. Thus, in order to overcome this
problem, it is generally considered that a rotary motor
is used to reduce the speed through gears. However, a
greater reducing ratio decreases the pickup transfer
speed, while a smaller reducing ratio does not allow
smooth low-speed transfer.The system with the rotary motor will be explained
taking an example of a CD player.A pickup head during data reading (playback) must
move ca. 30 mm in about 60 min. Thus, reliable
controllability in very low moving speeds including
30 mm/3600 sec
