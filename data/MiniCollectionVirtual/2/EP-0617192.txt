<ABSTRACT>
In the case of known fire ladders, the upper flange and lower flange are profiled such that they have a high degree of rigidity with respect to bending and rotation as well as a high degree of dimensional stability and simultaneously serve as a guide for the telescopically extendable ladder parts. In order to achieve this, use is made of profiles which are complicated to assemble and special profiles. The object of the invention is to make it possible to use commercially available hollow profile bars and to produce all weld seams by external welding. This object is achieved in that the lower flange (3) comprises a commercially available box-shaped hollow profile bar (6) which, by means of one edge (7), comes into contact with a plane (9) running parallel to the rung plane (8), the box-shaped hollow profile bar (6) preferably has a square cross-section, and then one cross-sectional diagonal runs parallel to the plane (9) and the other runs perpendicularly thereto, and in that guidance of the extendable ladder parts takes place by a roller/rail combination (11, 12), a roller (13) and a lateral guide roller (14).
