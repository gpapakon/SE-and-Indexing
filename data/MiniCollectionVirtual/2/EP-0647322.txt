<DESCRIPTION>
 Tumor Marker ControlField of the InventionThis invention relates generally to the field of stable human serum based controls for use in in vitro diagnostic assays and more specifically to stable human serum based controls for use in monitoring the precision of in vitro diagnostic assays for tumor markers.Background of the Invention Tumor markers are substances released by tumor cells into the blood stream. The tumor markers can be detected in serum or other body fluids and are useful for clinically monitoring various malignancies. The term tumor marker has been extended to include cell or tissue characteristics, such as oncogenes or abnormally expressed proteins such as enzymes, hormones, and receptors that are related to and assist in identifying the tumor type.Clinical oncologists measure the presence and/or amount of these markers in bodily fluids to assist them in the diagnosis of the condition, as well as for prognosis and the monitoring of the treatment of the patient. Serum assays of tumor markers are commercially available.These serum assays are performed using assay systems such as radioimmunoassay, enzyme immunoassay, fluorescence immunoassays and other clinical analysis techniques.Controlling and monitoring the accuracy, precision, and reliability of these assay systems is critical to ensure that the patient receives the correct treatment and that the results of the assays are medically relevant.Currently, some human serum based controls are commercially available. Controls, generally, are in levels representing specific ranges, for example a high, low, and/or normal range. These commercially available tumor control products include Cancer Antigen Controls, from POL YMEDCO, T-MARKERS QUALITY CONTROL SERUM, from NMS Pharmaceuticals, Inc. and LYPHOCHEKÂ® Tumor Marker Control, from BIO-RAD. Currently available commercial controls, 

however, lack many of the tumor markers that are required by the clinical oncologists. Moreover, the currently available commercial controls have limited clarity, limited lyophilized stability and limited reconstituted stability. Also, some of the commercially available controls are only two level controls (i.e. High and Low). In addition, the concentrations of some of the components in the commercially available controls are either too high or too low to be completely useful.Although methods have been published to purify some of the tumor markers many of these methods are tedious and require several steps. Each additional step results in a lower yield of the tumor

<CLAIMS>
We claim:
1. A control for the determination of tumor markers comprising a mixture of :
(a) a base material comprising human serum or plasma having reduced lipids wherein the serum or plasma is essentially free of antibodies to PAP;
(b) a plurality of tumor markers.
2. The control of claim 1 wherein said control is lyophilized.
