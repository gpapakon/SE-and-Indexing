<ABSTRACT>
In order to carry out monitoring of a network in accordance with the ATM standard, the method consists:     - in reading the cells conveyed at a point (P) of the network (R), - in carrying out a pre-processing consisting in shaping the cells read, in selecting the cells which are useful for executing test operations, in recalculating at least a part of the checking information, and in putting the recalculated checking information and the received checking information into message form, the said messages being intended to undergo a subsequent processing in order to check, in particular, the consistency between the recalculated checking information and the received checking information. Application particularly for checking the flow of data cells and the protocols for communication with local networks.

A method of monitoring and/or testing a
telecommunications network carrying information in the

form of cells complying with the ATM standard
(Asynchronous Transfer Mode) or similar, said cells

having a header to allow user cells to be distinguished
from maintenance cells (F4, F5), the control data being

created on transmission and transmitted in the user cells
and/or in the maintenance cells transmitted, said method

being characterised in that it consists in:

reading the carried cells at a point (P) of the network
(R),
preliminary processing consisting in editing the cells
read, selecting the cells which can be used to conduct

test operations, re-calculating at least some of the
control data and placing the re-calculated control data

and the control data received in message format,
said messages being intended for subsequent processing
as a means of checking in particular the consistency

between the re-calculated data and the control data
received.
A method as claimed in claim 1, characterised in that
if control data are contained in the maintenance cells,

said messages may be messages of a first type (A) which
will contain re-calculated control data or messages of a

second type (B) which will contain the control data of
the maintenance cells, said messages of the second type

(B) containing an indicator so that these can be
recognised as relating to maintenance cells. 
A method as claimed in one of claims 1 or 2,
characterised in that said cells contain a virtual path

identification number (VPI), said messages contain said
virtual path identifiers (VPI) and in that said

subsequent processing associates a context with each
virtual path in the form of a report allowing said

coherence of control data associated with said virtual
path (VP) to be checked.
A method as claimed in one of claims 1 or 2,
characterised in that said cells contain a virtual path

identifier (VPI) and a virtual channel identifier (VCI)
and said selection of cells consists in associating

corresponding fictitious virtual path (VPF) numbers with
certain predetermined virtual paths and channels, in that

said messages contain said fictitious virtual path (VPF)
numbers and in that said subsequent processing consists

in associating a context with each fictitious virtual
path (VPF) in the form of a report allowing said

coherence of control data associated with said fictitious
virtual path (VPF) to be checked.
A method as claimed in one of claims 1 to 4,
characterised in that said selection of cells consists in

particular of dropping cells which do not contain any
information.
A method as claimed in claim 3, characterised in that
one of said control data items is a group of parity bits

(BIP) calculated from the data contained in a set of
transmitted user cells.
A device for monitoring and/or testing a
telecommunications network carrying information in the

form of cells complying with the ATM standard 
(Asynchronous Transfer Mode), said cells having a header

to allow user cells to be distinguished from maintenance
cells (F4, F5), the control data being created on

transmission and transmitted in said user cells and/or in
said maintenance cells (F4, F5), said device being

characterised in that it comprises :

a pre-processing unit (1) which receives as input the
cells carried at a point (P) of the network (R) and

provided in order to edit the received cells, select the
cells that will be used to run test operations, re-calculate

at least some of the control data and set up
messages containing the re-calculated control data and

the control data received,
and in that the pre-processing unit communicates with
a processing unit (2) in order to transmit said messages

thereto.
A device as claimed in claim 7, characterised in that
if the control data are contained in the maintenance

cells (F4, F5), the pre-processing unit sets up messages
of a first type (A) to contain the re-calculated control

data and messages of a second type (B) containing the
data received from said maintenance cells, said messages

of the second type (B) containing an identifier which
allows them to be recognised as relating to maintenance

cells.
A device as claimed in one of claims 7 or 8,
characterised in that said cells contain a virtual path

identifier (VPI), said messages contain said virtual path
identifiers (VPI) and in that the processing unit (2) is

a unit programmed to associate with each virtual path
(VP) a memory space allocated to a context in the form of 

a message allowing the coherence of the re-calculated
control data and the control data contained in the cells

belonging to said virtual path (VP) to be checked.
A device as claimed in one of claims 7 or 8,
characterised in that said cells contain a virtual path

identifier (VPI) and a virtual channel identifier (VCI)
and the pre-processing unit (1) has a translation memory

(5) which can be addressed as a function of the values of
the virtual path and channel identifiers (VPI, VCI)

received and supplying for each pair of virtual path and
channel values either a word representative of a non-selected

cell or a word containing a value for a
fictitious virtual path (VPF) corresponding to said pair

of values, and in that the processing unit (2) is a unit
programmed to associate with each fictitious virtual path

(VPF) a memory space allocated to a context in the form
of a report allowing the coherence of re-calculated

control data and control data contained in the cells
belonging to said fictitious virtual path (VPF) to be

checked.
A device as claimed in claim 10, characterised in
that said translation memory (5) is also addressed by the

header of said cells and in that the word which it
supplies contains a maintenance indicato
r if the header
is that of a maintenance cell (F4, F5).
A device as claimed in claim 10 or 11, characterised
in that it has a context-handling processor (4) linked to

said processing unit (2) and in that said translation
memory (5) can be modified by said handling processor

(4).
