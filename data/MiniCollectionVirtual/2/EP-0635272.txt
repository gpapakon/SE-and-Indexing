<ABSTRACT>
A sustained release parenteral composition comprising an 
admixture of at least one drug to be delivered in a 

therapeutically effective amount and a bioabsorbable 

lactone polymer containing one or more lactone monomers 
that is a liquid at body temperature, provided in an 

amount effective to sustain or extend the release rate of 
the drug and a method for administering said composition 

to an animal.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to the use of absorbable liquid
lactone copolymers for the parenteral administration of
drugs. More specifically, it relates to the use of liquid
lactone copolymers in parenteral applications for
sustained or extended drug delivery.Pharmaceuticals are commonly administered parenterally in
isotonic solutions. However, this dosage form is not
always well suited for all drugs or prolonged drug
therapies. To overcome these and other shortcomings of
this dosage form several new injectable dosage
formulations have recently been developed.The most notable recent development has been the use of
bioerodible or bioabsorbable polymers in injectable dosage
formulations. Several publications describe these new
injectable dosage formulations such as U.S. Patent
3,982,537 and U.S. Patent 4,054,138 issued to Bucalo, U.S.
Patent 4,938,763 issued to Dunn et al. and "Biodegradable
block copolymer matrices for long-acting contraceptives
with constant release" J. Contr. Rel. 32 (1992) 3-14 by
Z.W. Gu et al. Each of these publications presents a 
different formulation that may one day replace conventional parenteral formulations.Other publications include WO 94/02184 (Medinvent), US 4818542 (The University of
Kentucky Research Foundation), WO 90/05522 (Prisell et al) and FR 2390962
(Ethicon, Inc).WO 94/02184 describes a biologically degradable polymer for manufacturing a
composition for treating impaired tissue. The composition in liquid form is injected
into the tissue and hardens in situ to a solid state to become a network controlled by the
injection.US 4818542 describes a controlled release drug delivery system comprised of solid
porous polymeric microspheres for parenteral administration. The microspheres
incorporate drugs or other agents confined within the network of interconnecting
channels of the porous polymeric materials.WO 90/05522 describes a slow release pharmaceutical preparation comprising a
combination of one or several receptor/binding proteins with biodegradable polymers.
The polymers are said to be porous.FR 2390962 describes a parenteral composition containing a solid bioabsorbable
polymer which can be in the form of particles dispersed in a normal saline solution or
pharmaceutically acceptable oil or in the form of pellets for implantation. The
composition contains a drug intended to be released over an extended period. Bucalo describes the use of low melting hydrogenated
vegetable oils and fats as injectable in-situ implants or
injectable microspheres. The implants are formed
</DESCRIPTION>
<CLAIMS>
A parenteral composition suitable for injecting subcutaneously or
intramuscularly at least one drug into animals, the composition comprising an

admixture of at least one drug to be delivered in a therapeutically effective amount, and
a bioabsorbable lactone copolymer composed of two or more lactone monomers

selected from the group consisting of L-lactide, D,L-lactide, 1,4-dioxanone, ε-caprolactone,
1,5-dioxepan-2-one and trimethylene carbonate, said copolymer being a

liquid at body temperature, provided in an amount effective to sustain or extend the
release rate of the drug, wherein the inherent viscosity of the copolymer is between 0.05

dL/g and 0.8 dL/g as determined in 0.1 g/dL solution of hexafluoroisopropanol at 25°C
and the lactone copolymer contains substantially no unreacted monomer and no

functionalised end groups which directly allow cross-linking and curing of the
copolymer to form solids.
The parenteral composition of claim 1 wherein the polymer is
poly(lactide-co-ε-caprolactone); poly(lactide-co-p-dioxanone);

poly(lactide-co-1,5-dioxepan-2-one); poly(ε-caprolactone-co-p-dioxanone); or
poly(1,5-dioxepan-2-one-co-p-dioxanone).
The parenteral composition of claim 1 wherein the polymer is a terpolymer
prepared from a three monomer combination of L-lactide, ε-caprolactone and

p-dioxanone.
The parenteral composition of any one of claims 1 to 3 wherein the polymer is
liquid at 25°C.
