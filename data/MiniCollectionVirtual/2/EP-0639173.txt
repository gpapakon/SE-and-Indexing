<DESCRIPTION>
European Patent Publication No. 0,186,120 was
published on July 2, 1986, and relates to certain prior art
2-(2'-methyl-3,4 substituted benzoyl)-1,3-cyclohexane-1,3-diones
as herbicides. The compounds can have the following
structural formula

wherein R1 through R8 are substantially the same as defined
below except that R7 can be alkoxy or trifluoromethoxy.U.S. Patent No. 4,797,150 discloses cyclohexanetrione
compounds as herbicides. In WO 90/05712, there is
disclosed 2-chloro- and 2-bromobenzoyl cyclohexanediones as
herbicides.The compounds of the present invention have unexpectedly
superior herbicidal activity over the cited prior art
compounds or give unexpectedly reduced injury to certain crop
plants.This invention relates to 2-(2'methyl,3',4'-trisubstituted
benzoyl)-1,3-cyclohexanediones, their use as
herbicides and herbicidal compositions containing the compounds.Embodied within the scope of this invention are
novel compounds having the following structural formula 

wherein
R1 is hydrogen or C1-C4 alkyl, preferably methyl;R2 is hydrogen or C1-C4 alkyl, preferably methyl;R3 is hydrogen or C1-C4 alkyl, preferably methyl;R4 is hydroxy, hydrogen or C1-C4 alkyl, preferably
methyl; orR3 and R4 together are carbonyl (=0) with the
proviso that R1, R2, R5 and R6 are C1-C4 alkyl, preferably
all methyl;R5 is hydrogen or C1-C4 alkyl, preferably methyl;R6 is hydrogen, C1-C4 alkyl, preferably methyl,
C1-C4 alkylthio, preferably methylthio or C1-C4 alkylsulfonyl,
preferably methylsulfonyl, with the proviso that when
R6 is C1-C4 alkylthio or C1-C4 alkylsulfonyl, then R3 and R4
are not together carbonyl;R7 is methyl or ethyl; andR8 is (1) halogen, preferably chlorine or bromine;
(2) nitro; or (3) RbSOn- wherein n is the integer 0 or 2,
preferably 2, and Rb is (a) C1-C4 alkyl, preferably methyl or
ethyl.The term "C1-C4 alkyl" includes methyl, ethyl,
n-propyl, isopropyl, n-butyl, sec-butyl, isobutyl and t-butyl.
The term "halogen" includes chlorine, bromine, iodine
and fluorine.Salts of the above-described compounds (as defined
hereinafter) are also the subject of the instant invention.The compounds of this invention can have the following
four structural formulae because of tautomerism: 

wherein R1, R2, R3, R4, R5, R6, R7 and R8 are as defined
above.The circled proton on each of the four tautomers is
reasonably labile. These protons are acidic and can be
removed by any base to give a salt having an anion of the
following four resonance forms:
 
wherein R1, R2, R3, R4, R5, R6, R7 and R8 are as defined
above.Examples
