reception resonators intended to be used for a dielectric antenna 

duplexer wherein a branching circuit is arranged on a grounded outer 
surface of a dielectric ceramic body and is separated and electrically 

insulated from an outer conductive member on the grounded outer surfaces, 
and resonant conductive members of signal transmission and signal 

reception resonators are arranged interdigitally and the adjacently 
located resonant conductive member of the resonator for signal 

transmission and that of the resonator for signal reception are arranged 
in parallel and directed in a same sense, whereby the number of 

components of the device can be significantly reduced.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a dielectric filter device
comprising dielectric resonators to be used for signal transmission and
reception respectively.Various dielectric filter devices of the above identified type,
that are also called dielectric duplexers, have been proposed. For
instance, Japanese Patent KOKAI No. 63-144602 discloses a dielectric
filter device comprising a dielectric coaxial resonator for signal
transmission and a dielectric coaxial resonator for signal reception with
their respective open sides directed oppositely in order to prevent
undesired coupling of the dielectric coaxial resonator for signal
transmission and the dielectric coaxial resonator for signal reception.
Japanese Patent KOKAI No. 4-121103 discloses a dielectric filter device
comprising resonators and coupling substrates for carrying out
interstage/input-output coupling for the resonators, these components
being held in a case. Japanese Patent KOKAI No. 60-57203 discloses a
device constituted of a plurality of dielectric filters, each comprising
dielectric resonators and being arranged with branching circuit formed on
ceramic substrates.Any of the above described devices are proposed as dielectric
antenna multiplexers and comprise branching circuits that are arranged
independently from the dielectric resonators of the device and connected
to an antenna and coupling elements such as capacitors that are disposed 
between the dielectric resonators. With such an arrangement, a large
number of components are inevitably used for a dielectric filter device
to prevent any attempt to reduce the size of the device. Additionally,
variances in the performance can appear as a result of assembling the
dielectric resonators and branching circuits, entailing cumbersome
adjusting operations after the assembly.Secondly, noises can often appear in conventional dielectric filter
devices due to inductive or electromagnetic coupling that occur between
the dielectric resonators for signal transmission and those for signal
reception to make the filtering operation unstable. While the use of
coils and capacitors as well as other improved coupling and/or connecting
members has been proposed to avoid these problems, such additional
components require additional space for the filter device to make it
rather bulky and costly.In view of the above identified problems, it is therefore an object
of the present invention to provide a dielectric filter device that can
be realized with a minimum number of components and reduced dimensions
and without
