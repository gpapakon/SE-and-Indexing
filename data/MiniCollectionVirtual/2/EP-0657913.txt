<ABSTRACT>
A cathode ray tube apparatus can accurately, easily 
and automatically correct influences exerted on both of a beam 

landing drift and an image distortion drift by terrestrial 
magnetism applied to a cathode ray tube (CRT). A correction 

current based on an output of a terrestrial magnetism sensor 
(45) is supplied to a Z-axis correction coil (41) and an X-X 

axis correction coil (42). A terrestrial magnetism component 
(B
H
 cosϑ) of Z-axis direction is canceled by a correction 
magnetic flux generated by the Z-axis correction coil (41), and 

a terrestrial magnetism component (B
H
 sinϑ) of X-axis direction 
is canceled by the X-X axis correction coil (42), whereby a beam 

landing drift and a image distortion drift are corrected 
automatically.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a cathode ray tube
apparatus having a cathode ray tube, such as a television
picture tube or a display tube used by an information terminal
device for displaying characters and graphics and, more
particularly, is directed to a cathode ray tube apparatus in
which a beam landing drift and a drift of image distortion
caused by influence of terrestrial magnetism can be corrected.In a cathode ray tube apparatus, such as a television
receiver or display apparatus having a color cathode ray tube
(referred to hereinafter as "CRT" when necessary) with a color
selection mask, such as an aperture grille or shadow mask, it is
known that beam landing and image distortion are affected by
terrestrial magnetism.FIGS. 1 to 3 of the accompanying drawings show
measured results of beam landing drift caused by terrestrial
magnetism.FIG. 1 shows measured results of drifts of landing
patterns 1, 2 and 3 obtained when a face plate 10 of a cathode
ray tube is faced to the direction East (E), the direction South
(S), the direction West (W) and the direction North (N),
respectively. Dotted line patterns in FIG. 1 depict reference
line patterns obtained when there is no terrestrial magnetism, 
i.e., when there is no external magnetic field. Solid line
patterns in FIG. 1 depict practical patterns changed by the
terrestrial magnetism. When the face plate 10 of the cathode
ray tube is faced to the direction East (E) and the direction
West (W), the center patterns are placed at the same position in
which the reference line pattern 1 obtained in the absence of
the terrestrial magnetism and the practical pattern 1 overlap
each other.FIG. 2 shows a beam landing drift amount Δ obtained
between a particular color beam 4 shown by a solid line and a
beam 5 shown by a dashed line when the beam 4 is displaced in
the direction shown by an arrow A. Specifically, the beams 4
and 5 bombards a fluorescent substance 8 of a particular color
coated on the face plate 10 through an opening (slit or hole) in
a color selection mask 6. In order to obtain a satisfactory
color purity, it is an indispensable condition that a particular
color beam, e.g., a green beam 4 should bombard the fluorescent
substance 8 of particular color.FIG. 3 is a diagram showing plotted results of the
beam landing drift obtained at six points (see FIG. 1) of the
picture screen end portion when the cathode ray tube is rotated
one time within the horizontal plane in the magnetic field
caused by terrestrial magnetism under the condition that a tube
