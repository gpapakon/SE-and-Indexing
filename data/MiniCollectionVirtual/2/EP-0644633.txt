<ABSTRACT>
A passively-mode-locked laser generator comprising an active optical 
fibre and fibre pumping means adapted to cause the generation of an 

emission signal in the fibre, a polarization control means, signal 
extraction means and at least one optical component with 

transmissiveness depending on polarization, all inserted in an optical 
fibre path that, for a pumping energy lower than a predetermined value 

corresponding to a linear propagation condition of the signal, gives 
rise to a polarization rotation of the emission signal through an 

angle causing the extinction of the signal itself within said optical 
component with transmissiveness depending on polarization and, for a 

pumping energy of a higher power than said predetermined value, causes 
a polarization rotation of the emission signal through an angle 

corresponding to the transmission with low losses within said optical 
components of the only pulses of high peak power of the emission 

signal.

<DESCRIPTION>
Under many circumstances in the telecommunications field it is 
desirable to obtain pulsated laser emissions of a particularly limited 
duration. Pulses of the above kind having a duration Î´t < 100 ps, commonly 
referred to as ultrashort pulses, or "solitons" under guided 
propagation conditions, apply for example in the field of high speed 
digital telecommunications (up to 10 GBit/s), for making optical 
instruments, carrying out tests on semiconductor components and also 
remote measurements, in topography or in the atmospheric-radar field, 
for example. To this end, optical-fibre laser devices using erbium-doped optical 
fibres are known, in which an active modulating device of the 
electro-optical type is inserted in an optical path forming a laser 
cavity so as to enable propagation and amplification of the desired 
pulses alone. Such devices are commonly referred to as mode-locked devices of the 
active type, because the modulating device present therein and 
operated from the exterior acts on the modes generated in the laser, 
thus enabling amplification as far as a level supporting the laser 
emission in the selected modes alone. Devices of the above kind are for example described in OPTICS LETTERS, 
vol. 14, No. 22, November 15, 1989, pages 1269-1271 by J.D. Kafka, T. 
Baer and D.W. Hall, in ELECTRONICS LETTERS, vol. 26, No. 3, February 
1, 1990, pages 216-217, by A. Takada and H. Miyazawa, and in 
PROCEEDINGS OF II TOPICAL MEETING ON OPTICAL AMPLIFIERS, Optical 
Society of America, 1991, Snowmass Village, Colorado, US, pages 
116-119, by T. Pfeiffer and H. Schmuck (SEL Alcatel Research Centre). Also known are mode-locked pulse laser generators of the passive type  
 
comprising optical-fiber laser devices (a "figure-of-eight" laser) in 
which a nonlinear amplifier loop mirror (NALM) is employed which is 
connected to a unidirectional loop to make a laser in which 
mode-locking is generated in the absence of external drive means. In the above devices the nonlinearity of the amplifier loop, when the 
highest luminous intensities occur, causes a light deviation from one 
inlet fibre to the other at the unidirectional loop; in this manner 
the system exhibits lower losses at higher luminous intensities than 
at lower luminous intensities, so that only pulses of greater 
intensity are maintained; this condition forces the laser to operate 
in a pulsated manner. Devices of this kind are described in ELECTRONICS LETTERS; Vol. 27, 
No. 6, March 14, 1991, pages 542-543, by D. J. Richardson, R. I.
