<ABSTRACT>
The mould which has sectors (11), is designed so that, during the moulding phase, the moulding elements (10, 10a, 10b, 10c) are all equidistant by virtue of members (13) providing elastic repulsion between them. Some of the elements slide circumferentially with respect to their sector (11) in the final closing phase. In this way, the pinching of rubber between sectors is avoided and the appearance of moulding flash is avoided.

A mould for a tyre tread, defining in the moulding
position a continuous ring (1) comprising a relief

formed of successive repeating motifs in the
circumferential direction, said motifs ensuring the

moulding of the tread pattern on the radially outer
surface of the tread, said tread pattern having a pitch

in which transverse grooves appear, said mould being
formed of individual integral elements (10, 1
0G, 10D),
each of said elements having a circumferential

development corresponding at most to two adjacent
motifs, said elements being grouped in the mould to

ensure the moulding of said tread by the radially inner
face of each element, characterised in that said

elements are individually mobile, in a direction of
approach towards or movement away from the axis of the

mould at least over one final moulding distance, said
elements also being mobile relative to one another at

least while they are moving along said final distance.
A mould according to Claim 1, characterised in
that said continuous ring (1) is formed of at least 30

circumferentially adjacent elements (10, 10G, 10D) in
the moulding position.
A mould according to Claim 1 or 2, characterised
in that said elements have a sufficiently small

circumferential dimension for the difference between
the extreme circumferential components of the

displacement observed at all points on the moulding
surface of each element to be less than 0.04% of the

moulding perimeter.
A mould according to one of Claims 1 to 3,
characterised in that said elements are distributed in 

one or more axially adjacent groups, and that, within a
group, they are all mobile in one direction forming the

same angle relative to the radial direction.
A mould according to one of Claims 1 to 4,
characterised in that said elements are mounted on at

least five sectors (11), with play between elements,
and that, during the movement corresponding to said

distance, the elements may slide circumferentially
relative to said sectors.
A mould according to one of Claims 1 to 4,
characterised in that said ring is divided into two

parts (G, D) which can separate axially, each mounted
on a crown (5), the crowns being able to be moved apart

or together axially relative to each other, each part
containing at least one group of elements (10G or 10D).
A mould according to Claim 6, characterised in
that each part (G or D) comprises a single group of

elements, the back of each element comprising a contact
face (19), in axial engagement on the outer side with a

continuous peripheral hoop (50), and in that means
exerting an extension force having a component parallel

to the axis of the mould are arranged between the crown
and the loop.
A mould according to Claim 6 or 7, characterised
in that each element is mounted on one of the crowns

(5) by a device (54) which provides a degree of freedom
in sliding between the element (10G or 10D) and said

crown (5), said sliding taking place along an axis
which is inclined relative to the axis of the mould,

such that a movement in one axial direction of a crown
(5) involves a movement in a radial direction of said

elements (10G or 10D), at least over said distance
corresponding to the depth of the tread pattern. 
A mould according to one of Claims 1 to 8,
characterised in that it comprises means ensuring

elastic repulsion between elements (10, 10G, 10D).
A mould according to one of Claims 1 to 9,
characterised in that each of said elements comprises,

on one of its non-moulding transverse faces opposite a
non-moulding transverse face of the adjacent element,

at least one recess (12) in which there is arranged a
member (13) ensuring said elastic repulsion.
A mould according to one of Claims 1 to 10,
characterised in that each element has a

circumferential development corresponding to a single
motif.
A mould according to Claim 6, 7 or 8,
characterised in that each element is made integral on

a crown by a device (54) which provides a degree of
freedom in sliding between the element and said crown,

said sliding taking place along an axis which is
inclined relative to the axis of the mould, such that a

movement in one axial direction of a crown involves a
movement in a radial direction of said elements, at

least over said distance corresponding to the depth of
the tread pattern.
A method for manufacturing a tyre, characterised
in that a mould according to one of Claims 1 to 12 is

used.
A method for manufacturing a tyre according to
Claim 13, characterised in that the tyre is

progressively assembled on a rigid core acting as a
support for assembling the constituents, then serving

as an element moulding the inner cavity of the tyre
during vulcanisation.
