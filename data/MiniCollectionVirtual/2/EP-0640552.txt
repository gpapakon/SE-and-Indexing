<ABSTRACT>
A catching device 3 for a carriage 1, guided on rails 2, of an inclined or vertical lift engages on each rail 2 in a clamping manner without sliding friction. It consists in each case of an eccentric 31, held on a stop and preloaded in its direction of action, and of a brake block 32 as engagement safety feature. The carriage 1 has a main frame 11, on which the car is mounted, and a sliding frame 12 which is guided in a sliding manner in the direction of travel relative to the main frame 11. To dampen the relative movement upon engagement of the catching device 3, at least one shock absorber 6 is arranged between main frame 11 and sliding frame 12. In case of an emergency, a slack-rope tripping mechanism 4 and a speed limiter 5 are provided as tripping devices, which throw the catching device 3 into engagement with the rails 2 and immediately clamp the sliding frame 12 on them by means of self-locking friction. The main frame 11 with the car runs onto the sliding frame 12 and is gradually brought to a stop via the shock absorber 6. The brake path of the carriage 1 can here be dimensioned in a manner suitable for all conceivable applications and is independent of the instantaneous coefficient of friction on the rails 2 on account of the self-locking engagement of the catching and clamping device 3.

The catching device of an inclined or vertical lift's
carriage (1) guided on rails (2), said lift including a cam disk

assembly (eccentric disk 3
1
) mounted in an eccentric way and
prestressed in the active direction at each rail (2) with self-locking

friction, whereby the antagonistic surfaces (3
2
) insure
the engagement respectively, so that the catching device (3)

engages the rails (2) in an blocking relationship, with an
releasing device (4, 5) in the case that a cable breaks and/or

the allowed velocity of the carriage (1) is exceeded for
engagement with the cam disk assembly (3
1
) at the associated rail
(2), whereby the carriage (1) is composed of a main frame (1
1
)
and of a slide frame (1
2
) which is slidably mounted in the
direction of the movement (A) of the carriage (1), whereby the

connection between slide frame (1
2
) and main frame (1
1
) comprises
on both sides an elastic means (6), characterized in that the

axis of rotation (3
11
) of the cam disk assembly (3
1
) held against
an abutment (3
61
) at the slide frame (1
2
) is slidably mounted
opposite to the main frame (1
1
) of the carriage (1), in that the
antagonistic surfaces (3
2
) insuring the engagement comprise brake
blocks (3
2
) mounted with the slide frame, and in that the elastic
means is a shock absorber (6) for damping the relative movement

between slide frame (1
2
) and main frame (1
1
) when the cam disk
assembly (3) engages the rails (2).
The catching device as claimed in claim 1, further comprising
a gravity weight (3
3
) mounted with each eccentric disk (3
1
) to
prestress the eccentric disk (3
1
).
The catching device as claimed in claim 1 or claim 2,
characterized in that the releasing devices (4 and 5) comprise a 

retreat bow (3
6
) with an abutment (3
61
) at each eccentric disk
(3
1
), which are connected together with a release shaft (3
4
).
The catching device for a carriage (1) as claimed in claim 3,
wherein said first releasing device comprises a slack rope

release (4), comprising:

The rocker (4
1
), swively (swivel joint 4
11
) mounted to said
main frame (1
1
) of the carriage (1) and to which ends said cables
(7) are connected, and
push rods (4
2
), swively (swivel joint 4
21
) coupled to the ends
of said rocker (4
1
),
for swively engaging said release shaft (3
4
).
The catching device as claimed in claim 3, wherein said
second releasing device comprises an overspeed safety device (5)

comprising

one sensor wheel (5
1
) which is rotably (axis 5
11
) mounted on
each rail (2) with the slide frame (1
2
), and
at least one crescent fly weight (5
3
), swively mounted to
said sensor wheel (5
1
) and prestressed radially inward toward an
axis of rotation of said sensor wheel (5
1
),
said at least one crescent fly weight (5
3
) having a pin (5
31
)
swively engaging the release shaft (3
4
).
The catching device as claimed in claim 5, further comprising
two opposing fly weights (5
3
), connected together by a coupler
(5
6
) via two swivel joints (5
5
) to form a joint parallelogram (5
4
-5
5
-5
5
'-5
4
')
so that said fly weights (5
3
) move synchronously in a
radial direction of said sensor wheel.
The catching device as claimed in claim 6, wherein the two
fly weights (5
3
) are disposed in a case ring (5
2
) connected with
the sensor wheel (5
1
), whereby the case ring (5
2
) is closed on
the side opposite to the sensor wheel (5
1
) with a case cover 
(5
21
), said case ring (5
2
) has slots (5
1
) therein through which
said pins (5
31
) protrude.
The catching device as claimed in claim 7, wherein an end of
said at least one leaf spring (5
8
) is attached to the case ring
(5
2
) and another end of said leaf spring (5
8
) presses said fly
weights (5
3
) radially toward said axis of rotation of said sensor
wheel (5

), wherein the case ring (5
2
) together with the leaf
spring (5
8
) is rotably mounted in the direction of the
circumference between case cover (5

the determination of the releasing centrifugal force.
The catching device as claimed in claim 8, wherein each two
of said leaf springs (5
