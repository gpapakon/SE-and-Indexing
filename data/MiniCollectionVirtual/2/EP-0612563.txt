<ABSTRACT>
Composite catalyst which contains:   - a zeolite of MFI structure containing silicon, aluminium and/or gallium in its lattice, and in which the outer surface of its crystallites has been modified after its synthesis,   - a matrix, - at least one noble metal of the platinum group, at least one additional metal chosen from the group consisting of tin, germanium, indium, copper, iron, molybdenum, gallium, thallium, gold, silver, ruthenium, chromium, tungsten and lead,   - at least one halogen,   - optionally gallium and/or zinc, - and optionally at least one element chosen from the group consisting of the alkali and alkaline-earth metals.   The invention also relates to the use of this catalyst in aromatization reactions of hydrocarbons containing from 2 to 12 carbon atoms per molecule.
