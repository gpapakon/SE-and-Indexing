<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a packaging machine for large-format cuboid bundles (10) consisting particularly of cigarette sticks, with a device (32) for introducing the bundle (10) into a foil portion (24a), there being provided a conveyor device for conveying tubular foil (20) lying flat to a cutting and welding station (23) for severing the foil portion (24a) and for closing the latter on one side, a device (15) for opening the foil portion (24a) and for pushing it onto a holding device (30) and a welding station for closing the non-welded end of the foil portions (24) closed at one end by means of a welding seam and filled with the bundle (10), with a tensioner (35) engaging into a projecting length of foil (24a) on opposite sides of the latter and capable of being moved apart.

Packaging apparatus for large-size parallelepipedic 
bundles (10) consisting of parallelepipedic 

articles stacked next to and above one another, in 
particular cigarette sticks, with a conveying device for 

conveying tubular film (20) to a cutting and welding 
station (23) for severing a film portion (24) and closing 

the latter on one side, with a device (26) for opening 
the film portion (24), with a turret (27) which can be 

driven in steps and which has for each switching station 
a holding device (30) for the opened film portion (24), 

the said holding device delimiting a reception space for 
a bundle (10), with a device (32), provided in the 

introduction position of the turret (27), for introducing 
the bundle (10) into a film portion (24), and with a 

welding station for closing the non-welded end of the 
film portion (24) closed at one end by means of a weld 

seam and filled with the bundle (10), characterized in 
that, by means of the conveying device for tubular film 

(20), the latter can be conveyed horizontally, lying 
flat, into the cutting and welding station (23) in a 

length required for the film wrapping, plus an excess 
film length (24a), from which cutting and welding station 

the film portion (24) can be displaced in the conveying 
direction of the tubular film (20) on to the holding 

device (30) located in the introduction position for a 
bundle, the device (32) for introducing the bundle 

comprises a collecting station (33) for parallelepipedic 
articles lying flat, for assembling the bundle, the push-out 

position of the turret (27) for pushing out the  
 

filled film portion is offset 90Â° to the side in relation 
to the introduction position, and the welding station for 

closing the non-welded end, the said welding station 
being arranged between the push-out position of the 

turret (27) and a push-in position of a cartoning machine 
designed as a conveyor, is provided with tensioners (35) 

engaging into the excess film length (24a) on opposite 
sides of the latter and capable of being moved apart from 

one another. 
Packaging apparatus according to Claim 1, characterized 
in that the device (26) for opening the film 

portions (24) closed at one end by means of a weld seam 
comprises suckers (26) which engage on the non-welded end 

and which can be displaced jointly in order to push the 
film portions (24) onto the holding device. 
Packaging apparatus according to Claim 1 or 2, 
characterized in that the holding device is formed from 

spreadable battens (30). 
Packaging apparatus according to Claim 3, characterized 
in that the battens (30) are angled battens. 
Packaging apparatus according to one of Claims 1 
to 4, characterized in that the welding station for 

closing the non-welded end of the film portions (24) has 
welding jaws (36) extending vertically. 
Packaging apparatus according to one of Claims 1 
to 5, characterized in that the welding station for 

closing the non-welded end of the film portions (24), 
closed at one end by means of a weld seam and filled with 

the bundle (10), is followed by the cartoning machine for 
large-size parallelepipedic bundles (10), with a conveyor 

(1), capable of being driven in steps and running through 
a plurality of successive standstill positions, for the 

reception of erected carton blanks (4) open on both sides 
and having tabs (6, 7, 8, 9) projecting laterally on both 

sides, folders, arranged adjacent to the conveyor (1), 
for folding round the tabs (6, 7, 8, 9), a push-in device 

for pushing in the bundles (10) on the head side, and a 
glue-coating device (12), the conveyor (1) comprising two 

oppositely arranged groups of rotating belts (2) which  
 

carry holding battens (5) for holding the erected carton 
blank (4) on the top side and underside. 
Packaging apparatus according to Claim 6, characterized 
in that the conveyor (1) is an elevator conveyor. 
Packaging apparatus according to Claim 6 or 7, 
characterized in that the belts (2) are toothed belts. 
Packaging apparatus according to one of Claims 6 
to 8, characterized in that, in the push-in position for 

the erected carton blanks (4), the holding battens (5) 
engaging on the side of the carton blank (4) which trails 

in the conveying direction are located in the region of 
deflection of the belts (2). 
Packaging apparatus according to one of Claims 6 
to 9, characterized in that the glue-coating device (12) 

is arranged between two standstill positions of the 
conveyor (1). 
Packaging apparatus according to one of Claims 6 
to 10, characterized in that, in the standstill position 

of the conveyor (1) which follows the glue-coating device 
(12), pressure plates (15) are provided for the tabs (6, 

7, 8, 9). 
Packaging apparatus according to one of Claims 6 
to 11, characterized in that an adhesive-tape feed (16) 

leads in each case between two standstill positions of 
the conveyor (1) on both sides of the latter. 
Packaging apparatus according to one of Claims 6 
to 12, characterized in that erected carton blanks (4) 

and/or bundles (10) can be fed from opposite sides.
