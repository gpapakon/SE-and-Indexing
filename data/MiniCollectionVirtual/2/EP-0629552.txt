<ABSTRACT>
A method of feeding portions (2) of wrapping 
material, cut off a continuous strip (3), to a packing 

line (4), which method, for feeding each portion (2), 
includes stages consisting in making in the strip (3) at 

least a first partial transverse cut (31) by means of a 
first fixed blade (29) cooperating with a movable blade 

(28); and in making in the strip (3) at least a second 
partial transverse cut (33), aligned longitudinally with 

the first partial transverse cut (31) and completing 
detachment of the portion (2), by means of a second 

fixed blade (32) cooperating with the movable blade 
(28); the strip (3), in the course of making the second 

partial transverse cut (33), being drawn by feed 
elements (15) not involving the strip portion in which 

the second partial transverse cut (33) is to be made.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method of 
feeding portions of wrapping material to a packing line. In particular, the present invention relates to a 
method of dividing a continuous strip of wrapping 
material into single portions or sheets, and 
successively feeding the portions to a packing line 
consisting, for example, of an overwrapping line for 
packets of cigarettes or boxes or cartons containing a 
number of packets of cigarettes. According to British Patent n. 1,550,136, a 
continuous strip is fed to a packing line using two 
separate supply lines arranged in series. The first feed 
unit upstream comprises two intermittent 
counter-rotating rollers substantially tangent to each 
other, and respective peripheral portions of which run 
along the strip; while the second feed unit comprises 
two continuous intermittently operated suction belts for 
retaining and drawing along respective lateral edges of 
the strip.  
 According to the above British patent, the 
portions of wrapping material are detached from the 
continuous strip using two separate cutting devices 
arranged in series along said path portion. More 
specifically, for detaching each sheet from the strip, 
the first cutting device makes two longitudinally 
aligned transverse lateral cuts in respective lateral 
edges of the strip between the two feed units; while the 
second cutting device, operating on the laterally cut 
strip portion under control of the second feed unit, 
makes a central cut in the strip to join the two lateral 
cuts and so detach the sheet. While still under control 
of the second feed unit, each sheet is then intercepted 
at a transfer station by the product for wrapping, by 
which it is pushed towards the packing line. Cutting the sheets off the continuous strip in two 
stages is extremely advantageous in that it permits both 
the strip and the sheets to be fed exclusively by 
traction to the transfer station, thus eliminating any 
possibility of jamming, were the strip or sheets at any 
time to be pushed downstream as they travel towards the 
transfer station. Though fairly satisfactory, the above device is 
particularly complex and expensive, due to featuring two 
cutting devices. It is an object of the present invention to 
provide a highly reliable, relatively straightforward, 
low-cost method of feeding portions of wrapping material  
 
to a packing line. According to the present invention, there is 
provided a method of feeding portions of wrapping 
material to a packing line, whereby said portions are

<CLAIMS>
A method of feeding portions of wrapping 
material to a packing line, whereby said portions (2) 

are cut successively off a continuous strip (3); 
the method 

comprising stages consisting in making at least a first 
partial transverse cut (31) in said strip (3) by means 

of first fixed cutting means (29) cooperating with 
movable cutting means (28); in making in said strip (3) 

at least a second partial transverse cut (33), aligned 
longitudinally with said first partial transverse cut 

(31) and completing detachment of said portion (2), by 
means of second fixed cutting means (32); 

said strip (3), in 
the course of making said second partial transverse cut 

(33), being drawn by feed means (15) not involving the 
strip portion in which the second partial transverse cut 

(33) is to be made, 
characterized in that, 

said second fixed cutting means (32) cooperates with said 
movable cutting means (28). 
A method as claimed in Claim 1, characterized 
in that said movable cutting means (28) are supported by 

strip conveyor means (12) located upstream from said 
feed means (15). 
A device for feeding portions of wrapping 
material to a packing line, whereby said portions (2) 

are cut successively off a continuous strip (3); 
the device comprising first fixed cutting 

means (29) and movable cutting means (28) cooperating  
 

with each other for making, in the course of detaching 
each portion (2), at least a first partial transverse 

cut (31) in said strip (3); second fixed cutting 
means (32) 

for making in said strip (3) at least a second 
partial transverse cut (33) aligned longitudinally with 

said first partial transverse cut (31) and completing 
detachment of said portion (2); feed means (15) being 

provided for drawing said strip (3) in the course of 
making said second partial transverse cut (33), and 

which do not involve the strip portion in which the 
second partial transverse cut (33) is to be made, 

characterized in that, 
said second fixed cutting means (32) cooperates with said 

movable cutting means (28). 
A device as claimed in Claim 3, characterized 
in that it comprises strip conveyor means (12) located 

upstream from said feed means (15) and supporting said 
movable cutting means (28). 
A device as claimed in Claim 4, characterized
