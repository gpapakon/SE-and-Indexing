<ABSTRACT>
A sputtering target (1) in which a gascomponent source (3) 
(element capable of evolving gas) is built in the bottom 

portion of the target. The predicting and determining the 
expiration of life of sputtering targets may be permitted 

more precisely and in a simpler way than heretofore whereby 
over-sputtering can be positively prevented with improvement 

of target use efficiency.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to sputtering targets having a lifealarm 
function and capable of preventing over-sputtering 
positively and reliably while keeping target use efficiency 
higher. The film-forming or film-depositing technology that 
utilizes the sputtering phenomenon caused by the glow 
discharge under a reduced pressure in the presence of dilute 
gas is now used in a broad range of applications including 
technological devices and equipment, electronic devices and 
equipment, and ornaments or decorations. As regards the 
sputtering targets used in that technology, many proposals 
have been made and varied types of targets suited for the 
individual applications are in use. Sputtering targets usually are disk-shaped, and 
sputtering is carried out with each sputtering target 1 
bonded to a water-cooled backing plate 2 of copper, as 
shown in FIG. 4.  
 As sputtering is continued, the target is consumed with 
the lapse of time, normally as indicated in FIG. 5. When the 
point where erosion has progressed most severely reaches a 
location near the bottom of the target, the life of the 
target is deemed to have expired and the target is replaced 
by a new one. If the timing for replacing the sputtering target is too 
early, such a substantial part of the target is left unused 
that the target efficiency is poor. Conversely if the timing 
lags the target efficiency is improved but erosive attack of 
the backing plate (over-sputtering) can take place. For the 
practice of sputtering, therefore, precise judgment of the 
sputtering target life has been a very important requirement 
to be considered. Whether a sputtering target in service is nearing the end 
of its life or not can hardly be directly determined 
visually or otherwise. It has been customary to use, as a 
measure of sputtering target life, the integrated electric 
power value that is closely related to the consumption of the 
target. Specifically, with different types of sputtering targets  
 
the relations between their integrated electric power values 
and degrees of erosion are determined beforehand on the basis 
of actual past operation results. From the relations the 
critical values of integrated electric power that cause 
over-sputtering are calculated. Thus, it has been in 
practical that, at the point where the integrated electric 
power value during sputtering with a given target has reached 
a preset value near its critical value, the target life is 
judged to have expired and the target is replaced by a new 
one. However, this

A sputtering target bonded to a backing plate (2) containing a gas-component source (3) in the 
bottom portion of the target for a life alarm function, said gas-component source being a 

hydride of a metal, an organic material or a container in which a compressed gas is sealed.
