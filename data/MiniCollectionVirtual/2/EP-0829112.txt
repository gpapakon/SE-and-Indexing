<ABSTRACT>
A printed monopole antenna (10) is disclosed including a first printed circuit board (12) having a first side (14) and a second side (16), a first monopole radiating element in the form of a conductive trace (18) formed on a side of the first printed circuit board (12), and a second monopole radiating element (20) in the form of a conductive trace positioned adjacent the first monopole radiating element, wherein the first monopole radiating element is resonant within a first frequency band and the second monopole radiating element is resonant within a second frequency band. In order for the first and second radiating elements to be resonant within different frequency bands, the conductive traces for each have different electrical lengths. No direct electrical connection exists between the monopole radiating elements, but the second radiating element dominates at a frequency in which the second radiating element is approximately a half-wavelength so that coupling with the first radiating element occurs. The first and second monopole radiating elements are formed on the same side of the first printed circuit board, separate sides of the first printed circuit board, or on separate printed circuit boards.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to monopole
antennas for radiating electromagnetic signals and,
more particularly, to a printed monopole antenna
including a plurality of radiating elements of
different electrical lengths formed adjacent to each
other so the monopole antenna is resonant within a
plurality of frequency bands.It has been found that a monopole antenna
mounted perpendicularly to a conducting surface
provides an antenna having good radiation
characteristics, desirable drive point impedance, and
relatively simple construction. As a consequence,
monopole antennas have been utilized with portable
radios, cellular telephones, and other personal
communication systems. To date, however, such monopole
antennas have generally been limited to wire designs
(e.g., the helical configuration in U.S. Patent
5,231,412 to Eberhardt et al.) which operate at a
single frequency within an associated bandwidth.In order to minimize size requirements and
permit multi-band operation, microstrip and lamina
antennas have been developed for use with certain
communication applications. More specifically, U.S.
Patent 4,356,492 to Kaloi discloses a microstrip
antenna system including separate microstrip radiating
elements which operate at different and widely
separated frequencies while being fed from a single
common input point. However, these radiating elements
are directly connected with each other and require a 
ground plane which fully covers the opposite side of a
dielectric substrate from such radiating elements.
Clearly, this design is impractical for monopole
antenna applications, and indeed functions in a
completely different manner. Likewise, the lamina
antennas disclosed by U.S. Patents 5,075,691 and
4,800,392 to Garay et al. require both a direct
connection between radiating elements and a ground
plane in order to provide multi-band operation.Further, U.S. Patent 5,363,114 to Shoemaker
discloses a planar serpentine antenna which includes a
generally flat, non-conductive carrier layer and a
generally flat radiator of a preselected length
arranged in a generally serpentine pattern secured to
the surface of the carrier layer. One form of this
antenna has a sinuous pattern with radiator sections
in parallel spaced relation in order to provide dual
frequency band operation. However, it is seen that the
two frequencies at which resonance takes place
involves the length of each radiator section and the
total length between first and second ends. While this
arrangement is suitable for its intended purpose, it
likewise
