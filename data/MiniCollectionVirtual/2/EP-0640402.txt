<ABSTRACT>
An improved apparatus for generating a powder 
stream to be applied to a work piece (22) includes a 

powder reservoir (12), a mixing chamber (14), a powder 
metering valve (36,38), a transfer conduit (16), and a 

nozzle (18). The metering valve allows control of the 
powder flow from the reservoir into the mixing chamber 

where it is dispersed with and entrained in an air flow 
entering the chamber through an aspirating inlet (30). 

The air entrained powder is then conveyed from the 
mixing chamber via the transfer conduit to the nozzle. 

The nozzle includes a controllable gas flow input (43) 
and a powder stream generating passageway (42) 

configured and associated with the transfer conduit to 
generate a reduced pressure in the conduit and mixing 

chamber which draws the air borne powder from the 
chamber into the nozzle. One or more of the individual 

components are adjustable to control the size, 
configuration, thickness or other parameters of the 

coating on the work piece as a result of the applied 
powder stream.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates generally to apparatus for
generating a gas-borne powder stream and, more particularly, to
apparatus for the application of a powder to a work piece. The
invention finds particular utility in the fabrication of threaded
devices having a coating of fusible thermoplastic resin.It is now conventional in the threaded fastener industry to
apply various coatings to the threads of fasteners to achieve
predetermined performance characteristics. The coating may provide
enhanced frictional engagement, or a self-locking function. It may
create an adhesive bond between the fastener and a mating threaded
device. Other coatings are also used for lubrication, masking and
electrical insulation. Often, such coatings are formed by applying
a stream of air-borne thermoplastic resin particles onto the
fastener which has been preheated to a temperature above the
resin's melting point. Upon impact, the resin particles melt and
fuse into a coating which will adhere to the fastener when the
resin cools and resolidifies.Examples of prior art apparatus used in the fabrication of
such coated threaded devices are disclosed in United States Patents
Nos. 4,120,993; 4,775,555; 4,815,414; 4,842,890; 5,090,355;
5,141,375 and 5,221,170. An example of prior art apparatus
according to preamble of claim 1 is known from DE-A-3 639 139. The present invention is directed to a improved apparatus for
generating a powder stream and for applying the powder stream to a
work piece such as a threaded fastener. The apparatus of the
present invention provides greater versatility and improved
performance as compared with known prior art apparatus. It also
results in more precise coating configurations, more uniform
coating performance, and tighter coating tolerances. In addition,
the apparatus of the present invention allows the use of a wider
range of resin powders, including powders with particle sizes less
than about 150 microns.The apparatus of the present invention comprises an
apparatus as claimed in claim 1. The apparatus of the present invention may also include a
conveyor to move the work piece through the powder stream, a heater
to heat the work piece to a temperature above the powder melting
point, and a vacuum collector to capture the powder overspray
emanating from the nozzle which is not deposited onto the work
piece.In accordance with the present invention, one or more of the
individual components are adjustable in order to control the
coating size, configuration, thickness, or other coating
parameters, as
