<ABSTRACT>
A hardcopy device has various page processing steps in a printer, 
fax machine or the like which are actuated by a single 

motor (40) which connects through a gear mechanism to drive a 
main drive roller (42), a pick roller (32), and automatically 

move a pressure plate (34) in a feeder slot to and fro between 
a position of engagement holding a stack of pages against the 

pick roller (32) and a position of disengagement. A reverse 
action of the pick roller (32) kicks out partially picked pages 

into the feeder slot after the pressure plate (34) is moved 
to a position of disengagement.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates generally to printers and facsimile
machines, and more particularly to automatically feeding pages from
a stack in a hardcopy device.In printers and facsimile machines, it is very important to
provide reliable and automatic feeding or "picking" of individual
pages from an input stack into the paper path. It is equally
important to provide a main drive roller for moving each page past
a printing or scanning station to an output area.Prior inexpensive printers typically used a single large
diameter roller for picking the paper from a stack as well as for
moving the paper past the printhead, as was used in previous
DeskJet printers made by Hewlett-Packard Company. Many printers
and facsimile machines often separate the paper picking function
from the main drive roller function.Some printers facilitate stack feeding by the use of spring-loaded
trays which are usually removable for reloading of paper.
Others printers such as the LaserJet printers made by Hewlett-Packard 
Company have complicated feeder/picking devices employing
many parts in order to handle large quantity stacks of paper.Most facsimile machines have a simplified picking scheme which
provides very limited pressure at the leading edge of a several
stacked pages placed in an automatic document feeder. This usually
limits the number of pages in the stack to 5-10, with greater risk
of misfeeds when putting more the a few pages in the stack.Many printer devices have the capability of spacing apart
successive pages which are picked from a stack, such as with timing
devices, or the like.Document DE-A-29 19 796 disclosed the concept to drive all
driven parts of a hardcopy device by a single motor.
Additionally, this document discloses an input feeder having a
spring loaded pressure plate which is movable into and out of
engagement by way of a hand driven mechanism.There is a need to provide a more reliable, simplified low-cost
integration of all of the aforementioned functions in order to
assure satisfactory trouble-free operation of loading, picking, and
moving pages along the paper path of printers and facsimile
machines.It is an object of the present invention to create an
integrated mechanical drive system in a hardcopy device by using a
single motor for feeding, picking and processing successive pages
from a large quantity stack with minimal risk of misfeeds. In
particular, it is desirable to be able to handle automatically up
to twenty-five pages in an input stack of documents to be scanned
by a facsimile machine, and to

A hardcopy device for feeding pages from a stack of

sheets or documents into a paper path for processing by
the hardcopy device, comprising:


an input feeder (26, 28) integrated into the hardcopy
device for holding the stack in an angled position with a

leading edge of the pages at a lower position than a
trailing edge of the pages;
pick means in close proximity to said input feeder;
pressure plate means (34) movably attached to said input
feeder for exerting pressure on said stack of sheets or

documents;
a main drive roller means (42) for moving the pages past
a printing zone; and
a single drive motor (40) coupled through a gear mechanism
to said pick means (32), said main drive roller

means (42) and said pressure plate means (34), for
driving said pick means at a predetermined rate as well

as for moving said pressure plate means (34) between an
engagement position during the picking of a page and a

dis-engagement position.
The hardcopy device of claim 1 wherein said single drive
motor (40) is coupled through said gear mechanism (84 -

108) to said pressure plate means (34) for moving said 
pressure plate means into the dis-engagement position

between picking of successive pages from the stack and/or
when adding additional pages to said input feeder.
The hardcopy device of claim 1 or 2 which further includes
delay means coupled with said single drive motor (40)

and said pick means (32), for spacing apart successive
pages which are picked from said stack of documents or

sheets.
The hardcopy device of one of claims 1 to 3 which constitutes
a printer, e.g. an ink jet printer, wherein said

input feeder (26, 28) holds a stack of sheets to be printed,
and wherein said main drive roller means is

constituted by a single main drive roller (42).
The hardcopy device of one of claims 1 to 3 which constitutes
a facsimile device including a printer, e.g. an ink

jet printer, wherein said input feeder (26) holds a stack
of sheets to be printed, and wherein said main drive

roller means is constituted by a single main drive roller
(42).
The hardcopy device of one of claims 1 to 3 which constitutes
a facsimile device, wherein said input feeder (28)

holds a stack of documents to be scanned, and wherein
said main drive roller means is constituted by a single

main drive roller (42) for moving the pages past a scanning
zone (22).
The hardcopy device of one of the preceding claims which
further includes first control means selectively coupled

between said single drive motor (40) and said pressure
plate (34) to move said pressure plate from a position of

engagement for holding said stack against said pick means 
to a position of dis-engagement to allow said stack to

move away from said pick means (32).
The hardcopy device of claim 1 which further includes
second control means coupled to said pick means to reverse

the direction of said pick means to expel any residual
sheets remaining from the printing operation.
The hardcopy device of one of the preceding claims which
further includes:


a main drive roller (42);

wherein said pick means (32) includes a pick roller:
wherein said gear mechanism (84 - 108) is coupled between
said single drive motor (40) and said pick roller (32) to

drive said pick roller at a first rate;
wherein said gear mechanism (84-108) is coupled between
said single drive motor (40) and said main drive roller

(42) to drive said main drive roller at a second rate
faster than said first rate; and
wherein said gear mechanism is coupled between said single
drive motor and an output roller (43) to drive said

output roller at a third rate faster than said second
rate.
A method of processing pages in a hardcopy device, comprising
the steps of:


holding a stack of pages in an input feeder (26, 28);
maintaining engagement of the stack of pages with a pick
device (32) while processing the pages by putting a

spring-loaded pressure plate (34) in engaged position;
moving automatically the pressure plate (34) from the
engaged position to a dis-engaged position;
repositioning automatically the pressure plate (34) to
re-engage the remaining stack of pages with the pick device

(32); 
maintaining engagement of the remaining stack of pages
with the pick device (32) while processing successive

pages; and
commencing automatically the picking and moving of each
successive page after a predetermined time interval has

elapsed to provide spaced-apart pages passing through the
hardcopy device.
