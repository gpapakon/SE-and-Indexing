<ABSTRACT>
A thermally insulating sound absorbent panel consisting of a 
layer (2) of mineral wool covered with two aluminium sheets 

(4,5), particularly for ventilation ducts, characterised in 
that at least that covering layer located on the inside of 

the formed duct consists of an aluminium sheet (4) of 
thickness less than the minimum thickness required for 

subjecting to embossing, so that following embossing its 
surface comprises microlacerations of dimensions sufficient 

to interrupt the surface continuity of the sheet, but 
insufficient to allow passage of mineral wool fibres.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a thermally insulating and 
sound absorbent panel. Panels are known consisting of a layer of mineral wool 
(glass wool or rock wool) covered on one or both sides with a 
thin containing sheet of paper, cardboard, plastics, metal 
etc. When used in particular for forming ventilation ducts, 
these panels are generally covered externally with an 
aluminium sheet and lined internally with glass cloth or an 
aluminium sheet. If the internal lining is of glass cloth, the duct 
formed with such panels has a considerable tendency to form 
dust clouds consisting of glass fibres which have been 
separated by the air flow and entrained by it along the duct. If however the lining is of aluminium sheet the dust 
cannot form, but the duct emits considerable noise on air 
passage because of the poor sound absorption power of 
aluminium. In an attempt to solve these problems it has also been 
proposed to internally line panels used for constructing 
ventilation ducts with sheets of embossed aluminium which 
because of their surface "roughness" attenuate the phenomenon 
of acoustic reverberation.  However the sound absorption problem is only partly 
solved by this means, and on the other hand embossing can 
only be effected on aluminium sheets of a certain thickness 
(at least 60µ), leading to a considerable weight and high 
cost of the panel and the duct formed from it. To increase the sound absorption of such panels it has 
also been proposed to interrupt the surface continuity of the 
embossed aluminium with a series of holes distributed over 
its entire surface. However not even this solution, which again requires 
aluminium sheets of a thickness suitable for embossing, has 
proved satisfactory because if the holes are too small only 
poor sound absorption is achieved, whereas if the holes are 
larger there is indeed reasonable sound absorption however 
undesirable dust formation occurs. These drawbacks are overcome according to the invention 
by a thermally insulating and sound absorbent panel as 
described in claim 1. The present invention is further clarified with 
reference to the enclosed sheet of drawing showing in 
partially perspective view a panel according to the 
invention. As can be seen from the drawing, the panel according to  
 
the invention, used in particular for forming a ventilation 
duct, comprises an inner layer 2 of glass wool or rock wool, 
covered on both sides with two aluminium sheets 4, 6 applied 
by conventional methods. Specifically, the aluminium sheet 4,
