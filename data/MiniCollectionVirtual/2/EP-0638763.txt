<CLAIMS>
Indicator lamp comprising a hollow body adapted 
to accommodate a luminous component supplied with power 

by conductors connected to screw terminals and closed at 
the front by a transparent cap, wherein said terminals 

are staggered relative to the axis of the indicator lamp 
and at least one screw axis is at an acute angle to the 

indicator lamp axis. 
Indicator lamp according to claim 1 wherein said 
body has housings for accommodating parts supporting said 

screw terminals and attached to said conductors supplying 
power to said luminous component and a rear end of said 

body is surrounded by a cap providing access for said 
power supply conductors to said terminals and access for 

a screw operating tool. 
Indicator lamp according to claim 1 wherein said 
luminous component is fixed directly into said body. 
Indicator lamp according to claim 1 wherein said 
cap forms abutments adapted to limit the unscrewing 

travel of said screws. 
Indicator lamp according to claim 1 wherein said 
body has at least one bore in it enabling a conductor to 

reach a terminal. 
Indicator lamp according to claim 1 wherein the 
second terminal is connected to said lamp by a conductive 

blade inserted between said body and said cap. 
Indicator lamp according to claim 1 wherein said 
body has housings adapted to receive at least one screw 

and a captive nut supporting said screw. 
Indicator lamp according to claim 1 wherein said 
cap has openings for conductors to be connected to first 

and second terminals and openings for a tool for 
operating the screws of said terminals. 
Indicator lamp according to claim 1 wherein the 
axis of the screw near said luminous component is more  

 
steeply inclined to the indicator lamp axis than the axis 

of the screw to the rear of the indicator lamp. 
Indicator lamp according to claim 1 wherein 
said body comprises a bush and a terminal block 

independent of said bush and fixed to the rear thereof.
