<ABSTRACT>
A rolling stand has a frame and a pair of support shafts centered on respective parallel axes. Each shaft has outer end, inner and outer bearings and a gear. Respective rolls are carried on outer ends, and respective eccentric sleeves engage the shafts at the bearings. Respective pressure sleeves surrounds the shaft, and a controller pressurizes the sleeves and bends the shaft in the frame. A rolling stand consists of a frame (WG) and a pair of support shafts (TW1, TW2) centered on respective parallel shaft axes (A1, A2). Each support shaft has an outer end projecting past the frame, inner (NL1, NL2) and outer (HL1, HL2) axially spaced bearing portions, and a gear (AR1, AR2) between respective inner and outer bearing portions. Each outer bearing portion lies between respective inner bearing portion and outer end. Respective rolls (W1, W2) are carried on the outer ends outside the frame, and respective rotatable eccentric sleeves (LG1, LG2) engage the shafts at the bearing portions, so that spacing of the axes can be varied by rotating the sleeves in the frame. Respective pressure sleeves (DB1, DB2) surrounds the shaft between respective inner and outer bearing portions. A controller is provided to pressurize the sleeves and bend the shaft in the frame between the inner and outer bearing portions.

<CLAIMS>
A device for damping vibrations and reducing axial deflections in support
shafts (TW) for cantilevered roller pairs (W) in the finishing stand

installations of wire rolling production systems driven at high speeds, in
which each of the support shafts (TW) is supported on two sides in

bearing housings (LG) that are eccentrically movable towards each
other, and supports driving pinions (AR) between the bearings (HL; NL),
characterised in that

pressure sleeves (DB1; DB2) that are capable of being loaded with a
hydraulic fluid, the pressure and volume of which are adjustable, are

permanently fixed to the eccentrically movable bearing housing (LG1;
LG2) on each of the support shafts (TW1; TW2) and between the

bearings (HL1; HL2) thereof.
The device as cited in claim 1,
characterised in that

the pressure sleeves (DB1; DB2) are constructed so as to be
displaceable in the direction of the longitudinal axis of the support shaft

(TW1; TW2) and/or to be rotatable relative thereto.
