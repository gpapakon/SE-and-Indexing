<ABSTRACT>
A combined interferometer and refractometer includes two
interferometers each of which uses a light beam produced

from a common source which are split into measuring
component beams and reference component beams. The

measuring component beams are directed along parallel paths
to an object and are reflected back from reflecting

surfaces on the object which is so positioned as to produce
a fixed path length difference between the beams. The

reflected beams are re-combined with the reference
component beams to produce output beams which pass to a

detector system which derives an output signal from each.
Changes in refractive index are determined from any

difference in the two output signals, and the distance
moved by the object is determined from any change in either

one of the output signals or by summing them and dividing
by two. Methods are described whereby the measurements of

refractive index or of distance can be made absolute.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to interferometric measuring
apparatus which combines distance measurement with
measurement of refractive index.It is known from U.S. Patent No. 4,813,783 to use a
refractometer alongside a measuring interferometer in order
to determine the refractive index of the atmosphere in the
region through which the measuring beam of the
interferometer passes. By this means it is possible to
correct the measurements made by the interferometer for
changes in refractive index which may occur during the
measuring operation.The system described in the U.S. patent referred to above,
employs evacuable chambers through which each of the
measuring and reference beams pass, and provides two
interferometers which make measurements in parallel of the
same object. Various distance measurements are made with
the object at different positions and with different ones
of the evacuable chambers either fully evacuated or open to
the atmosphere. From the measurements the refractive index
of the atmosphere is determined, and the various distance
measurements are corrected for changes in the refractive
index.A known system for providing an absolute determination of
the refractive index of the atmosphere is described in our
European Patent Publication No. 508,583. In this
publication there is described at least one auxiliary
interferometer associated with a measuring interferometer,
and through which a portion of the beam of the measuring
interferometer is diverted. The diverted beam is split to
form so-called reference and measurement arms which travel
along different paths having a fixed, known path length
difference before being re-combined. An object of the present invention is to provide an
alternative interferometric measuring apparatus in which a
measuring interferometer is combined with a refractometer.According to the present invention there is provided
interferometric measuring apparatus comprising:
means for producing two collimated, coherent light
beams, beam splitting means for producing from each of the
light beams a measuring component beam and a reference
component beam, the measuring component beams being
directed in parallel towards reflecting surfaces on an
object the movement of which is to be measured, the beam
splitting means re-combining the respective measuring and
reference component beams after reflection of the measuring
component beams from said surfaces to produce two output
combined beams;detector means for receiving each of the two output
combined beams,wherein a known fixed
