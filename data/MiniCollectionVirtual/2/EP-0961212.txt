<ABSTRACT>
Method and an apparatuses for managing electronic documents on
a digital processing system or computer. In one embodiment, a web page

is accessed on the Internet at a first location. At least a portion of the web
page is then displayed. An image file capturing the displayed visual

representation of the web page is generated and stored on the computer
at a second location. A thumbnail representation is generated from the

displayed visual representation. The first location and the second location
are then associated with the thumbnail. Textual information included in

the displayed visual representation is preserved and added to a
searchable database. Subsequent selection of the thumbnail

representation allows one to access either the web page at the first
location or access the image file stored at the second location. The

image file may be viewed without having to access the electronic
document at the first location. Annotations may be added to the stored

image file in one embodiment. In another embodiment, data of the stored
image file may be copied and included with executable viewing code to

generate a self-contained viewing application to view the stored image file.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present inventian relates generally to field of document
management and, more specifically, the present invention relates to a
method for managing electronic documents on a digital processing system
or computer.The Internet and/or the World Wide Web have become convenient
and inexpensive resources for finding information about nearly every
subject imaginable, Users can shop for merchandise, get stock quotes,
tune into radio programs, chat with other users and engage in a host of
other activities, The tremendous in access to the World Wide Web (the
web) has been fueled by the wide spread availability of computer
programs called web browsers. A web browser is a client-side program
for establishing communications between a client computer and a server
computer on the web (i.e., a web server) using the hypertext transfer
protocol (HTTP). In a typical transaction, a web browser transmits a
request to download a document indicated by an address called a uniform
resource locator (URL). The download request is routed through the web
until it reaches a web server indicated by the URL. The web server 
responds to the request by transmittIng the indicated document,
commonly called a "web page," back to the client computer.Web pages are usually written using the hypertext mark up
language (HTML) and often include links to other objects. For example, a
web page may include links to one or more graphics objects that are to be
downloaded and displayed with the web page. A web page may also
include links to program code (e.g., Java code) that is to be downloaded
and executed on the client computer when the web page is displayed.
The downloaded code may be used to create a more interactive
presentation, for example, by animating portions of the web page or by
prompting for user input. A web page may also include pointers to plug-in
modules that are expected to be resident in the client computer. Such
program modules are commonly referred to as "plug-ins" and are
generally used to extend the capabilities of the web browser. For
example, a plug-in may be invoked to generate audio output, perform file
translation and so forth.Occasionally, a computer user may wish to capture a web page for
a later recall or to forward to another user. In many web browsers, this is
accomplished by saving a copy of the underlying HTML document,
including its links to graphics images, downloaded code, plug-ins and so
forth. When the HTML document is recalled from storage, the HTML is
reinterpreted by the web browser to regenerate the
