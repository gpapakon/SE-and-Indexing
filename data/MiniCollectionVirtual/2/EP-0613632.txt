<ABSTRACT>
A device for removing body hair, which includes a housing (10) a 
hair-plucking 

portion which is rotatably mounted to the housing (10). The hair-plucking 
portion includes 

one or more disc assemblies (12), each of which includes a pair of 
complementary discs (36), 

each of which has one or more radially extending arms (38) which 
terminate in a flattened 

peripheral portion. When the corresponding portions of the two discs 
(36) are pressed 

together, they form a trap for the hair. The disc assemblies also 
include a hub (34) which 

accommodates a pair of discs (36), one on each of its axial faces. The 
hub (34) has shoulders 

for engaging the arms (38) of each of the discs (36) so as to impart 
rotational motion to the 

discs upon the rotation of the hub (34). The hub (34) also has at pairs 
of protrusions (48) which 

extend axially beyond the plane of arms (38) of each disc (36). The hub 
(34) further has an edge 

which is perpendicular to its axis such that each pair of arms of the 
pair of discs is 

pivotable about the edge so as to alternately bring the corresponding 
flattened 

peripheral portions of the discs together to form a trap and apart to 
eject the removed 

hair. The hubs (34) may be mounted on a fixed curved shaft (31) and may 
be connected so that 

each hub (34) transfers the rotational motion to the adjoining hub (34). 
Alternatively, the hubs (34) 

may be mounted on a rotatable straight shaft (100) which imparts 
rotational motion to each hub (34).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to depilatory devices for removing body hair and,
more particularly, to devices for removing unwanted body hair by uprooting the hair.A large number of depilatory devices have been proposed through the years.
Depilation can be effected in one of two basic processes. In one process, implemented
by shavers of various types, strands of hair are cut, typically in the vicinity of the skin,
leaving the roots intact and in place beneath the skin surface. In the other basic
process, which will henceforth be referred to as 'hair removal', hair is removed without
cutting the strands, typically by vigorously pulling the hair strands so as to uproot the
hair and remove the entire hair, including the roots.In a number of applications, such as in the depilation of women's legs, it is
considered preferable to uproot hair rather than to cut it since the removal of the roots
considerably slows, and to some extent permanently thwarts, the growth of replacement
hair, and leaves the skin relatively smooth and virtually free of hair for relatively long
periods of time. By contrast, cutting the hair, as by shaving, does nothing to interrupt
or disrupt the hair growth and often leads to the early appearance of unsightly stubble
as the cut hairs continue to grow.Processes for the mechanical uprooting of hair generally involve grasping one
or more strands of hair and vigorously pulling on the hair so as to remove the entire
hair, including its roots. Care must be taken that the hair thus grasped and pulled is
not inadvertently cut in the process. Care must also be taken to ensure that the pulling
of hair occurs sufficiently quickly that the user does not sense an unacceptable amount 
of pain or discomfort. As may well be appreciated, everything else being equal, the
quicker the pulling action, the less painful is the uprooting.Various devices for accomplishing hair removal have been described and
reviewed in my earlier U.S. Patent Nos. 4,935,024 and 5,057,115 according to the prior art.Several of the proposed hair removal systems involve the use of tilted discs
which come together at a point to grasp one or more strands of hair. In such systems,
strands of hair are grasped at the point where the two discs momentarily come together
and are pulled as the discs continue to rotate. Further rotation of the discs causes the
distance between the discs to increase, allowing the uprooted hair to drop from the
device.Such systems generally suffer from at least two disadvantages. First, the
pinching of a

<CLAIMS>
A device for removing body hair, comprising:

(a) a manually grippable housing (10); and
(b) a hair-plucking assembly (12) rotatably mounted to said
housing (10), said hair-plucking assembly (12) including at

least two disc assemblies (28), characterized in that a disc
assembly (28) includes:


(i) a pair of complementary discs (36), each of said discs
(36) having at least one radial arm (38) extending in a plane,

said arm (38) terminating in a flattened peripheral portion (40)
which, when pressed against the corresponding portion (40) of

the other disc (36) forms a trap for the hair; and
(ii) at least one hub (34) for mounting one of said pair of
discs (36) on each of two axial faces of said hub (34), said hub

(34) having at least one shoulder (46) for engaging said at
least one arm (38) of each of said pair of discs (36) so as to

impart rotational motion to said par of discs (36) upon
rotation of said hub (34) about the axis of said hub (34), said

hub (34) having at least a pair of protrusions (48) which extend
axially in opposite senses beyond the plane of said arm (38) of

each of said pair of discs (36) for causing an adjoining disc
assembly to form that trap, said hub (34) further having an edge

(50) substantially perpendicular to the axis of said hub (34)
