<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to an arrangement for the generation 
of electric energy, which arrangement comprises a driving 
device, at least two current generators and a coupling 
between this driving device and these current generators. The driving device is for instance with internal combustion 
and may consist of a combustion engine, for example 
a diesel engine, or a gas turbine. This driving device 
also creates heat which can be used. An arrangement for the generation of electric energy of 
the aforementioned type is known from US-A-4 686 375. This 
arrangement serves for guaranteeing the current supply. A 
first electromechanical current generator continuously 
feeds a first load while a second electromechanical current 
generator supplies current to a second load only if 
necessary. Both current generators, however, supply the 
same current with the same well-defined frequency. In 
practice, this frequency is generally chosen equal to the 
frequency of the public electric network, i.e. 50 or 60 
Hz. In this last case, one of the current generators should be 
able to supply into the public network. This can be economically 
interesting, for example, if the driving device 
with internal combustion is part of a heat/power coupling 
installation, which is an installation using electric 
as well as thermic energy. For some applications it will be more efficient to use 
current at another, mostly higher, frequency. This may 
sometimes lead to more compact devices and a higher global 
electric efficiency. A practical example for this is the  
 
supply of an illumination system with high-pressure sodium 
discharge lamps. At a higher frequency, the value of the 
ballast and of the compensation capacitor diminishes. 
Thus, the price of the illumination system may drop considerably, 
while the use of smaller ballasts minimizes the 
electric losses. The invention aims at providing such an arrangement for 
the generation of electric energy with an optimum global 
efficiency. To this aim, the two current generators are generators 
having different frequencies. Thus, the most efficient frequency can be chosen for different 
appliances, by chosing the generator which supplies 
the current. In this manner, current with a higher frequency 
than the frequency of the mains supply can be obtained, 
when this current has to be transported only over 
a short distance. The transport of current with a high 
frequency over major distances is difficult because of the 
line induction. Suitably, one current generator is a
