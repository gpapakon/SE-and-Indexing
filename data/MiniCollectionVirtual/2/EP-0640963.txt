<ABSTRACT>
A recording and reproducing method writes 
information in the form of bits by the physical 

interaction between a probe and a recording medium 
opposed to the probe. The method includes a recording 

step of recording information by shifting a forming 
position of each bit by a predetermined shift amount in 

a horizontal direction of the recording medium in 
accordance with information, and a reproducing step of 

reproducing the information, based on the shift amount 
of each recorded bit in the horizontal direction of the 

recording medium. A recording and reproducing 
apparatus is so constructed as to perform the steps.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a recording
and reproducing method and a recording and reproducing
apparatus using a
scanning probe, according to the principle of STM or AFM
for writing and reading
information by physical interaction between the probe
having a tip at its distal end and a recording medium
opposed thereto.There is recently developed a scanning
tunneling microscope (hereinafter referred to as STM)
enabling to directly observe an electronic structure of
surface atoms of a conductor, whereby high-resolution
measurement of a real, spatial image became possible,
whether for a single crystal material or for an
amorphous material. [G. Binnig et al. Phys. Rev. Lett,
49, 57 (1982)]The STM utilizes the fact that a tunnel current
flows when a metal probe (tip) is brought close to a
conductive material, for example up to a distance of
about 1 nm, while applying a voltage between them.
This current is very sensitive to a change of the
distance between them. Scanning the surface with the
probe so as to keep the tunnel current constant, even a
variety of information concerning a total electron 
cloud in a real space can be read. For the measurement
the resolution is about 0.1 nm in in-plane directions.Accordingly, applying the principle of STM,
high-density recording and reproduction can be readily
effected in the atomic order (sub-nanometer order).
For example, a recording and reproducing apparatus, as
disclosed in Japanese Laid-open Patent Application No.
61-80536, is so arranged that atom particles adhered to
a surface of a medium are removed with an electron beam
to write data and the written data is reproduced by
STM.There are suggestions concerning a method which
employs as a recording layer a material having memory
effect for switching characteristics of voltage-current,
for example a thin-film layer of a material
selected from Ï€-electron organic compounds and
chalcogen compounds, to record and reproduce data with
STM (Japanese Laid-open Patent Applications No. 63-161552
and No. 63-161553). This method permits large-capacity
recording and reproduction, for example at the
density of 1012 bit/cm2 in case of the recording bit
size being 10 nm. Further, some suggestions are
directed to a reduction of the size, proposing
apparatus in which a plurality of probes with
respective tips are formed on a semiconductor substrate
and a recording medium opposed thereto is displaced to
record data (Japanese Laid-open Patent Applications No. 
62-281138 and No. 1-196751). For example, if the
above-described
