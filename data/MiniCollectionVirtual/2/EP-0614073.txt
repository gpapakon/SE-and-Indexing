<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to spectroscopic analysis 
and more particularly to spectroanalytical processes and 
systems of the polychromator type. In spectroanalytical systems using emission 
sources, material to be analyzed is introduced into an 
analytical region and excited to spectroemissive levels 
sufficient to emit detectable radiation characteristic of 
elements in the sample. The resulting emitted radiation 
typically is dispersed and analyzed spectroscopically to 
quantitatively determine elemental compositions of sample 
materials. An example of such analyses is the contract 
lab program (CLP) in which sample materials are analyzed 
for the toxic elements, arsenic, thallium, selenium and 
lead. Prior analytical systems for measurements of this 
CLP type have employed an atomic absorption graphite 
furnace with a hollow cathode lamp for each element of 
interest. An object of the invention is to provide a 
polychromator with improved detection limits suitable for 
analyses of the CLP type. In accordance with one aspect of the invention, 
there is provided a spectroanalytical system with 
radiation dispersing apparatus for dispersing radiation 
into a spectrum for concurrent application to an array of 
exit ports; sample excitation apparatus for exciting 
sample material to be analyzed to spectroemissive levels 
for generating a beam of radiation for dispersion by the 
dispersing structure; the exit port array including a 
corresponding array of detectors including a first 
detector positioned adjacent a first exit port positioned 
to sense first order radiation from an element of 
interest and a second detector positioned adjacent a  
 
second exit port to concurrently sense second order 
radiation from the same element of interest; and 
processing apparatus for responding to outputs of the 
first and second detectors to provide a compensated 
output as a function of the quantity of the element of 
interest in the sample material. In accordance with another aspect, there is 
provided a polychromator system with housing structure, 
entrance aperture defining structure in the housing 
structure for passing a beam of radiation from sample 
material excited to spectroemissive levels, dispersing 
structure in the housing structure for dispersing 
radiation in the beam into a spectrum, structure in the 
housing structure defining a plurality of exit apertures, 
first order detector structure associated with a first 
exit aperture structure, second order detector structure 
associated with a second exit
