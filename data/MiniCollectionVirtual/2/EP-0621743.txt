<ABSTRACT>
An electronic circuit arrangement for operating a discharge lamp, having 
a full-wave rectifier, a storage capacitor charged to a voltage greater than the peak of 

the rectifier output, and an isolating diode between the rectifier and the diode. An 
inverter is connected to the energy storage capacitor, and has a high frequency inductive 

load circuit connected between the inverter output and a junction between the isolating 
diode and the storage capacitor. A capacitor, connected to the junction in parallel with a 

series circuit formed by the isolating diode and storage capacitor, forms a high 
frequency resonance circuit with the inductive load circuit. Current is drawn from the 

rectifier only as a series of pulses at the inverter frequency.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a circuit arrangement for operating a discharge
lamp with a high frequency current comprising
input terminals for connection to a source of low frequency supply voltage,rectifier means coupled to said input terminals for rectifying said low
frequency supply voltage,a first circuit comprising series arrangement of unidirectional means and first
capacitive means coupled to a first output terminal N3 of said rectifier means and a
second output terminal N5 of said rectifier means,inverter means shunting said first capacitive means for generating the high
frequency current out of the rectified low frequency supply voltage,a load circuit comprising inductive means, second capacitive means and
terminals for lamp connection, said load circuit being coupled to a first terminal N1 of
said inverter means and to a second terminal N2 between the unidirectional means and
the first output terminal N3 of said rectifier means.Such a circuit arrangement is known from published PCT application WO
92/04808. Because of the coupling of the load circuit between the terminal N1 and the
terminal N2 a high frequency current is drawn from the supply voltage source when the
voltage of the first capacitive means, serving as main storage, is higher than the
momentary amplitude of the rectified supply voltage present between terminals N3 and
N5. This high frequency current improves the power factor of the circuit arrangement.
However, the supply current that is drawn from the low frequency supply voltage
during lamp operation still has a substantial spike near the maximum amplitude of the
low frequency supply voltage, when current is being drawn directly as a charging
current for the first capacitive means. For this reason the supply current still has an
undesirably high harmonic content.The present invention has for its object to provide a circuit arrangement, 
that during stationary lamp operation draws a current from the low frequency supply
source having a relatively low harmonic content.A circuit arrangement according to the invention is for this purpose
characterized in that the component values and the frequency of said high frequency
current are selected such that during stationary lamp operation the voltage present over
the first capacitive means is always higher than the amplitude of the rectified low
frequency supply voltage.As a result of the voltage present over the first capacitive means being
always higher than the amplitude of the low frequency supply voltage, current is never
drawn directly
