source for emitting a light beam; an objective lens for 

converging the light beam on an information storage 
medium; a hologram for receiving the light beam reflected 

by the information storage medium and generating 
diffracted light from the light beam, the hologram 

having such a polarization anisotropy that it diffracts

from the second polarization state; and a photodetector 

including a plurality of photodetective sections for 
receiving a part of the diffracted light and outputting 

a photocurrent in accordance with the intensity of the

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an optical
head device for performing recording/reproduction or
erasing data from information storage media such as
optical storage media including optical disks and optical
cards and magneto-optical storage media. Also, the
invention relates to an optical information apparatus
comprising the optical head device.In the field of optical memory techniques, an
optical disk having a pit-like pattern is used as an
information storage medium with a high storage density
and a large storage capacity. Recently, these optical
memory techniques have been into practical use and the
range of uses is increasing such as digital audio
disks, video disks, document filing disks and data
files.The recording/reproduction of data onto and
from the optical disk is performed using a light beam
focused on a minute spot. In performing this recording/reproduction
of data with a high reliability, the
configuration of an optical system has an important
role. The optical head device is one of the main
components of the optical system. The basic functions
of the optical head device can be largely categorized
into: a convergence of light for forming the minute
light spot at the diffraction limit, the focus control
and tracking control of the light beam and the detection
of a pit signal. These functions are realized by 
combining various kinds of optical elements and optical
signal detection methods differently in accordance with
the desired form and purpose of use.In order to make the optical head device more
compact and thinner, an optical head device using a
hologram has been under development. The inventors of
the present invention have directed their attention to
the hologram as a thin, light and flat-type optical
element and invented an optical head device in which
the hologram and an objective lens are integrally
provided as one unit (see Japanese Laid-Open Patent
Publication JP-A-4-212730). This optical head device
will be described hereinafter with reference to Figures
14 through 19.Figure 14 shows a blazed hologram 1 and a
light source 2 such as a semiconductor laser. This
optical head device is characterized by disposing the
blazed hologram 1 so as to be close to an objective
lens 4. The operation of the device will be described
hereinafter.A light beam 3 (laser beam) emitted from the
light source 2, after passing through the blazed hologram
1, is incident upon the objective lens 4 and is
focused on an information storage medium 5. The light
beam reflected by the information storage medium
