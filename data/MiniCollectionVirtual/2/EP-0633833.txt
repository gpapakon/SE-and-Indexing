<ABSTRACT>
Apparatus and methods for the formation of biaxially oriented thermoplastic articles having flat surfaces or sharp contours, and the articles so produced. Such apparatus and method relate to the heat-shrinking of biaxially oriented intermediates (50) onto male forms (82) to produce articles (70) of exacting dimensions and flat surfaces or sharply defined contours. Such thermoplastic articles include autoclavable, heat fillable, heat stable, transparent PET containers (70).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method for
producing a short drawn, thermoplastic, container-shaped
intermediate and to a method of producing a short drawn
container from the intermediate.The prior art relating to the molecular orientation
and heat-shrinking processes of thermoplastic linear
polymers, and to the use of these polymers for the
production of open-ended containers is discussed in the
introduction to WO 90/10410 and in the introduction to
WO 92/16354.WO 90/10410 discloses inter alia a process for the
production of a biaxially oriented thermoplastic article
which comprises forming a biaxially oriented intermediate
by blow moulding a portion of thermoplastic material
at its orientation temperature, placing the intermediate
on a male form of a predetermined size and texture,
heating the intermediate and form above the orientation
temperature of the material to heat shrink the intermediate
onto the surface of the form, cooling the heat
shrunk intermediate, and removing the heat shrunk intermediate
from the form.WO 92/16354 discloses a number of additional variants
of the method of WO 90/10410. In particular it
discloses:
(i) A method for the production of a container having
transparent sidewalls and a translucent rim. It involves
forming a biaxially oriented intermediate having
a crystallisable rim portion and simultaneously heat
setting the rim portion and heat shrinking the intermediate.(ii) An article having a depth of draw less than 1.0
comprises a transparent biaxially oriented bottom, side
walls comprising a transparent biaxially oriented portion 
adjacent to the bottom and a non-oriented crystallised
portion adjacent to the mouth of the article, and
a non-oriented crystallised rim.(iii) Converting an intermediate to a final product by
placing the intermediate on a male form and heating the
intermediate to above its orientation temperature by
means of air exiting the male form.Plug-assisted blow moulding, in which plug moulding
and blow moulding are combined, is described in US-A-3849028
(Van der Greg et al) and JP-A-56-864817.The present invention is concerned with the problem
of producing a short drawn (depth to diameter ratio <
1.0) container with a fully biaxially drawn side wall.
Such short drawn containers are particularly desirable
for use in the food container industry.That problem is solved, according to the invention,
by the method defined in Claim 1 of the accompanying
claims.The intermediate may then be converted into a
biaxially oriented thermoplastic article by the

</DESCRIPTION>
<CLAIMS>
A method for producing a short drawn, thermoplastic,
container-shaped intermediate having sidewalls and

a bottom wherein the sidewalls (502) are biaxially
oriented and the bottom has a central portion that is

unoriented surrounded by a biaxially oriented portion,
the method comprising securing a sheet of thermoplastic

at about its orientation temperature over the mouth of a
forming tube, forming an intermediate container shaped

intermediate by deforming a portion of the sheet into
the forming tube using a plug and then blow forming the

plug formed thermoplastic to thereby produce the intermediate,
characterised in that during plug forming the

central portion of the thermoplastic forming the bottom
of the intermediate is prevented from becoming oriented

by gripping the central portion of the thermoplastic
between a predefined portion of a leading surface of the

plunger (402) and a plunger follower (404) operatively
associated with the plunger.
The method of Claim 1, wherein the leading surface
(403) of the plunger (402) has a circumscribing sharp-edged

lip (401) about the predefined portion of the
leading surface.
The method of Claim 1 or 2, wherein the depth of
draw of the intermediate container-shaped article is

sufficient for full orientation of the side walls and
the bottom surrounding the central portion.
The method of any preceding claim, wherein the
depth to diameter ratio of the intermediate is between

0.1:1 and 1:1.
The method of any preceding claim, wherein the
thermoplastic is a crystallizable polymer.
The method of Claim 5, wherein the crystallizable
polymer is a polyester, polyhexamethylene adipamide,

polycaprolactam or polyhexamethylene sebacamide. 
The method of any of Claims 1 to 4, wherein the
thermoplastic material is a polyethylene terephthalate.
The method of producing a short drawn container
which comprises forming an intermediate by the method of

any preceding claim, and placing the intermediate onto a
male form having a predetermined size, shape and texture,

heating the intermediate to above the orientation
temperature of the thermoplastic to heat shrink the

intermediate onto the male form to thereby produce the
container and removing the container from the form.
The method of Claim 8, further characterised in
that during securing of the sheet over the forming tube

the sheet is clamped a select distance from the mouth of
the forming tube so that during plug forming of the

intermediate an oriented rim is formed between the area
where the sheet is clamped and the mouth of the intermediate.
The method of Claim 9, wherein means to prevent
sticking are provided about the mouth of the forming

tube.
The method of Claim 9, wherein following formation
of the intermediate the intermediate is fit
 over a male
form having a predetermined size, shape and texture and

the intermediate is simultaneously rim set and heat
shrunk.
