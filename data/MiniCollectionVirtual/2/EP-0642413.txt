Plate-like constructional element in the form of 
a self-supporting sandwich construction, comprising a 

heat-insulating layer bonded between two metal plates, 
characterised in that the heat-insulating layer (2) is 

formed from a highly compressed, heat-resistant fibrous 
material or a foamed glass, in that the metal plates 

(1), preferably steel plates, are coated with enamel at 
least on the inner side (12), and in that the fibrous 

material or the foamed glass is connected to the metal 
plates by being fused into the enamel layer. 
Constructional element according to claim 1, 
characterised in that the fibrous material is glass wool 

or rock wool. 
Constructional element according to claim 1, 
characterised by a low melting enamel layer on the inner 

sides (12) of the metal plates (1). 
Constructional element according to one or more 
of the preceding claims, characterised in that an 

intermediate layer of nonferrous metals or nonferrous 
alloys is provided between the metal plates (1) and the 

enamel layer. 
Method of producing a plate-like constructional 
element according to one or more of th
e preceding 
claims, characterised in that the plate-like 

heat-insulating layer (2), formed from fibrous 
materials, is pressed between the metal plates (1) which 

are provided with a molten enamel coating on their inner 
sides (12).  

 
Method according to claim 5, characterised in 
that fibres having different plasticising temperatures 

are used for the heat-insulating layer (2), and in that 
the fibres, which melt at a lower temperature, are 

heated above their plasticising temperature in order 
thereby both to cross-link the fibrous fabric and to 

fuse it into the enamel layers of the metal plates (1) 
through pressure. 
Method according to claim 5, characterised in 
that a high-melting glass fibre fabric or rock wool 

fabric is dusted with low-melting glass powder, whereby 
the low-melting glass powder is heated above the 

plasticising temperature and is thereby both 
cross-linked in the rock wool and fused into the enamel 

layer of the metal plates (1) through pressure.
