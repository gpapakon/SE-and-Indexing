<ABSTRACT>
Chlorine and sulfur-free fuel gas substantially 
comprising H₂ + CO for use as fuel in a gas turbine for the 

production of mechanical and electrical power and environmentally-safe 
flue gas is produced by the partial oxidation of liquid 

hydrocarbonaceous or solid carbonaceous fuels having chlorine and 
sulfur-containing impurities, cooling and splitting the raw fuel 

gas into two streams A and B, separately cooling raw fuel gas 
stream A by indirect heat exchange with dry N₂ gas while separately 

cooling the stream of raw fuel gas B by indirect heat exchange with 
the product stream of clean chlorine and sulfur-free fuel gas. HCl 

and particulate matter are then removed from raw fuel gas streams 
A and B; and, after combining raw fuel gas streams A and B together 

further cooling and removal of sulfur-containing gases takes place. 
By this process, attack on metal heat exchangers by the corrosive 

constituents in the raw fuel gas is prevented. In one embodiment, 
the clean chlorine and sulfur-free fuel gas is humidified and 

burned in the gas turbine to produce increased power and efficiency 
without polluting the atmosphere.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to the production of fuel gas by 
the partial oxidation of sulfur- and chlorine-containing liquid 
hydrocarbonaceous or solid carbonaceous fuels, purifying the fuel 
gas, and burning it in a combustion turbine for the production of 
power and environmentally-safe flue gas. In coassigned U.S. Pat. No. 3,868,817 fuel gas having a 
mole ratio (CO/H2) dry basis of at least 0.30 is produced by 
partial oxidation in the presence of a CO2-rich temperature 
moderator. After further processing, the fuel gas is burned in a 
combustion turbine. Production of fuel gas by partial oxidation of 
a hydrocarbonaceous fuel using comparatively high steam to fuel 
weight ratios and no subsequent catalytic methanation step is 
described in coassigned U.S. Pat. No. 3,688,438. In coassigned 
U.S. Pat. No. 4,075,831 purified and humidified fuel gas is burned 
in a gas turbine to produce mechanical work and electrical energy. 
A mixture of air/steam is mixed with fuel and burned to drive a gas 
turbine in U.S. Patent No. 4,537,023. However, the prior art does 
not teach or suggest the instant invention which provides the steps 
of cooling chlorine- and sulfur-containing raw fuel gas in a radiant 
cooler and splitting said raw fuel gas into two streams A and B; 
further cooling said stream of raw fuel gas A by indirect heat 
exchange with a stream of nitrogen gas, further cooling said stream 
of raw fuel gas B by indirect heat exchange with a stream of clean 
chlorine- and sulfur-free fuel gas, removing HCl and particulate 
matter from both streams of raw fuel gas and combining them 
together, and removing sulfur-containing gases from said combined 
streams to produce said stream of clean chlorine- and sulfur-free 
fuel gas comprising H2 + CO. Nor does the prior art provide the  
 
steps of introducing humidified clean chlorine- and sulfur-free fuel 
gas and a separate stream of supplemental dry nitrogen gas into the 
combustor of a gas turbine where combustion with air takes place 
and flue gas containing supplementary elemental nitrogen but no 
chlorine- or sulfur-containing or NOx gases is produced. Increased 
power and efficiency are obtained without polluting the atmosphere. The subject process pertains to the production of fuel 
gas which is free from chlorine- and sulfur-containing corrosive 
vapors by the partial oxidation of sulfur- and chlorine-containing 
liquid hydrocarbonaceous or solid carbonaceous fuel and burning 
said fuel gas in a turbo combustor by the following steps:
