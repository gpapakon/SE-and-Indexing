<ABSTRACT>
This invention relates to a logic circuit and a method of excersising integrated logic 
circuits without recourse to complex external test pattern generation, but which is based 

on a relatively simple input regime. In essence the method is carried out on storage 
elements in the integrated circuit which form a scan path by providing a feedback from 

elements in the path to a previous element.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to integrated logic circuits and in particular to a circuit and a method of
exercising such circuits
as defined in the precharacterizing
portions of claims 1 and 2, respectively.Very large scale integration techniques allow a large amount of logic to be realized by a
single device. Such a dcvice can be difficult to test, however, due to its complexity in
relation to the limited access to circuit nodes provided by external device pins.
Nonetheless it is normally possible to provide a functional test by driving device inputs
with known test patterns and monitoring outputs for a consistent response. In the case of
combinatorial logic, a series of test patterns may be defined which fully exercises all
possible device states to provide an exhaustive test which can form the basis of a practical
test if the number of inputs is not excessive. For devices having storage elements the task
can be significantly more complex, but by clocking elements to known states as part of
testing, worthwhile test patterns are still possible. Unfortunately, the derivation of a
substantially exhaustive test pattern can become a design exercise rivaling that of the
device itself in complexity and represents a significant cost to which the cost of equipment
required in practice to generate the test vectors and that of testing time must be added.
Such costs can be prohibitive for low production quantities and a limitation in, for
example, the application specific device market.In an attempt to overcome this problem 'Design for Test' philosophies have been
developed and are aimed at making devices more testable without recourse to full test
vector generation. For example, one such philosophy is based upon arranging that all
storage elements within a device are configurable, in a special test mode of device
operation into one or more chains and able to receive clock signals so that the chain
behaves as a shift register. The device, whatever its intended function, may then be
regarded as relatively simple (i.e. easily tested) combinatorial blocks between shift register
stages providing inputs and outputs to the blocks. By providing an input pin at one end of
the chain so that register stages may be loaded and an output pin at the other end so that
stages may be interrogated, testing independent of knowledge of overall intended device 
functionality is possible. Of course, external equipment to generate the test vectors to be
loaded and examine the resultant output is still required, but at least the test
