<ABSTRACT>
The present invention relates to the use of composite materials, in particular for the lamination of sun visors in automobiles, comprising a top layer and a foamed reverse side, where, in accordance with the invention, the top layer comprises a textile sheet-like structure and the foamed layer is produced from a powder mixture comprising     100 parts of a thermoplastic polymer   0 - 100 parts of filler   0.5 - 7 parts of blowing agent and   0 - 30 parts of auxiliary by scattering on and subsequently melting and foaming, and the textile layer and the foam layer comprise a PVC-free material from the same plastic family which can be welded by means of high frequencies.

<CLAIMS>
Use of composite work materials for the lamination
of sunshades in motor cars, consisting of a cover layer

and a foamed rear side, characterised in that the cover
layer consists of a textile fabric and the foamed layer

is produced from a powder mixture consisting of

100 parts of a thermoplastic polymer

0 - 100 parts of filling material

0.5 - 7 parts of foaming agent and

0 - 30 parts of adjuvant

by sprinkling on and subsequent melting and foaming up
and textile layer and foam layer consist of a high

frequency weldable PVC-free material of the same
synthetic material family.
Use according to claim 1, characterised in that
the synthetic material of the textile fabric possesses

a melting point which lies 20 to 50°C higher than the
melting point of the synthetic material to be foamed

up.
Use according to claim 1 or 2, characterised in
that the synthetic material to be foamed up has a

melting point of 70 to 110°C and is brought to a melting
point of above 120°C by cross-linking with peroxide

and/or energy-rich radiation during the foaming
procedure.
Use according to claim 1 to 3, characterised in
that, as synthetic materials, those are selected from

the family of the polyamides, polyesters, polyacrylates,
as well as their copolymers with polyethylene and

polypropylene.
Use according to claim 1 to 4, characterised in
that the foam layer is connected with an additional

lamination foil of the same synthetic material.
