<ABSTRACT>
A stepless automatic variable transmission with gears in a 
state of constant meshing which is operational without the need 

for disengaging or changing the gears such that the rotational 
output power can be varied to effect a neutral, low speed, medium 

speed, high speed, overdrive or reverse rotation by selecting a 
stepless automatic speed change method or a manual speed change 

method, and which includes a speed change system, an overdrive 
system and a speed change controlling system. 
The assembly of speed change system (10, 110, 310, 410, 510, 
610), the overdrive system (50, 360, 660, 760) and the speed 

change controlling system (80, 180, 380, 680, 780) can vary with 
each of the systems c
ombined to result in numerous stepless 
automatic variable transmissions. To effect speed changes low 

speed, medium speed, overdrive, and reverse rotation brake means 
are used. Also, either the manual speed change method or the 

automatic speed change method can be selected.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an automatic transmission, 
and more particularly, to a stepless automatic variable 
transmission assembled in such a way that power input to an input 
shaft can be converted and transmitted to an output shaft without 
changing or disengaging gears when accelerating or changing speed 
to initiate and maintain forward motion and when reversing the 
rotational direction of the output shaft to initiate and maintain 
a backward motion. In the conventional manual transmission, speed changes are 
accomplished by constantly choosing among different given gear 
ratios in accordance with the load. Such constant attention is 
annoying in that the gears must always be disengaged and/or 
engaged at the time of a desired or necessary speed change. 
Also, the existing automatic transmissions and belt type stepless 
automatic transmissions are complicated in design and structure 
and require a large dedicated installation area. Furthermore, 
such transmissions are expensive to manufacture. The above problems are addressed in U.S. Patent No. 
5,062,823 which issued on November 5, 1991. However the 
transmission described therein requires a separate means for  
 
reverse rotation of the output shaft thereby severely restricting 
the versatility of the transmission. Other transmissions which have solved the problem of 
initiating and maintaining a backward or reverse motion include: 
U.S. Patent Application Numbers 07/903,137 (filed 1992.6.23), 
07/920,892 (filed 1992.7.28), 07/921,050 (filed 1992.7.28) and 
08/028,824 (filed 1993.3.10). However, the present invention uses a design and 
construction of a speed change system which is different from the 
above described systems and includes an overdrive function which 
increases the rotational speed of the output shaft over the 
rotational speed input by the engine, or the like. A speed 
change controlling system in which the speed can be adjusted 
steplessly and automatically is also utilized in the present 
invention. Therefore, the objects of the present invention are to 
provide a stepless automatic variable transmission which can 
solve the above described problems which have yet to be 
efficiently and effectively solved in the prior art. Another object of the present invention is to provide a 
transmission which is not as complicated as those of the prior 
art, includes a very reliable speed change operation, has smooth 
rotational output, quickly adapts to a change in the load and 
which includes overdrive and reverse operations.
