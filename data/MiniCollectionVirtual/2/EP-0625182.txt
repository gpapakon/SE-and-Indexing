<ABSTRACT>
Liquid compositions comprising acyloxy alkane sulfonic acid salt, paraffin, water, optional salt reactant, and optional fatty acid are provided which have improved stability and pumpability. Also a method of preparing and a method of storing these compositions are provided utilizing temperature and particle size limitations. The composition, method of making, and method of storing the composition provide improved storage stability, pumpability, and a decrease in processing time for the incorporation of the composition into finished bar formulations.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to the preparation and storage of 
surface active materials and, in particular, to the preparation of 
compositions containing salts of esters of fatty acids with 
hydroxy alkane sulfonic acids, e.g., isethionate, said esters, 
i.e., acyloxy alkane sulfonates, having the general formula RCOOR' 
SO3M. Isethionates are well known as valuable synthetic detergents 
and wetting agents. Although acyl isethionates are usually 
incorporated into bar soaps in the form of a powder, prill, flakes 
or paste, the use of molten acyl isethionates is also known. When 
a liquid, e.g., molten, form of acyl isethionate is utilized, it 
may be necessary to store or transport this liquid to another 
location prior to its incorporation into a bar composition. 
Chemical and phase stability problems may arise upon storage of an 
aqueous acyl isethionate composition prior to its incorporation 
into a finished bar product. Detergent bars made with synthetic surfactants are difficult 
to process. In contrast, the processing of "soap bars" is readily 
accomplished by, e.g., milling, plodding, and molding. Soap 
becomes plastic when heated and can easily be plodded and molded 
under relatively low pressures, but most synthetic surfactants and 
detergent-filler combinations do not become plastic upon heating 
and the processing machinery often requires special designs. See 
US-A-2,678,921, J.A.V. Turck, Jr., issued May 18, 1954. 
Ideal syndet bar processing 
should be fast and problem free in terms of premix storage,  
 
milling, plodding, and molding. Unfortunately, syndet bar processing 
sometimes falls short in this respect. It is well known in the art to prepare surface active agents 
by direct esterification of the fatty acid with sodium isethionate 
under reduced pressure. US-A-2,635,103, Molteni et al., 
issued Apr. 14, 1953 teaches 
direct esterification. This process, however, requires an excess 
of the water-soluble hydroxyethylsulphonic acid salt and high 
temperatures from 200°-300°C. High salt content results in, and 
produces, hygroscopic bar soaps and the excess salt is expensive 
to remove. In addition, high temperatures produce strong discoloration 
of the end product. The process therefore has to be 
carried out under the cover of an inert gas. The reaction is also 
incomplete despite several hours of reaction time so that the 
excess fatty acid must be distilled off. To reduce discoloration, the prior art teaches the use of 
catalysts to accelerate the reaction time and the purification of
