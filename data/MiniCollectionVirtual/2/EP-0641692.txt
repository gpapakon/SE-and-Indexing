<ABSTRACT>
An antitheft device (1) acting on a motor vehicle gear lever (4) 
comprises means (16) movable relative to support means (10, 22) 

and arranged to cooperate with said gear lever (4), said means 
(16) comprising counteracting means (18) to be brought into 

contact with said gear lever (4) so as to prevent its movement 
when the antitheft device is engaged and consequently to prevent 

the use of the vehicle, said support means (10, 22) and the 
relative movable means (16) being arranged concealed within the 

usual gearshift protection part (3) positioned in the vehicle 
passenger compartment and from which the gear lever (4) projects. 

The movable means are a plate-like element (16) with a recessed 
end (18) arranged to lock the gear lever (4) in a plurality of 

positions corresponding to different gears, said element (16) 
comprising a polygonal hole (17) containing the actuator means 

(37), which are defined by an elongate element torsionally 
constrained to the lock (29).

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to an antitheft device acting on a motor 
vehicle gear lever, said gear lever projecting from a usual 
gearshift protection part provided in the vehicle passenger 
compartment. Various antitheft devices of the aforesaid type are known. In 
general, these devices comprise gearshift locking members which 
both when in their utilization position (antitheft device engaged) 
and when in their rest position (antitheft device disengaged) are 
visible within the passenger compartment, to the detriment of its 
appearance. Other known antitheft devices comprise removable bars 
which are fixed to the usual handbrake lever and cooperate with 
the gear lever to prevent its use. These devices are generally laborious to mount and often laborious 
to use. Other antitheft devices of the aforesaid type are known which are 
incorporated in a concealed manner within the gearshift protection 
part. One of these devices is described in BE-A-898020; this document 
describes an antitheft device to be mounted to the side of the 
gear lever and comprising a part fixed to the frame and a part 
movable relative to this latter to come into contact with the gear 
lever to lock it in a working position (with a gear engaged). The 
fixed part acts as a guide for the movable part or member, which  
 
is acted upon by a lever mechanism operated by a key. The lever 
mechanism carries at its end a pin movable within a guide provided 
transversely within the movable member, said lever mechanism being 
positioned parallel to said member when not cooperating with the 
gear lever, and having its longitudinal axis inclined (by an angle 
less than 90Â°) to the longitudinal axis of said member when this 
latter cooperates with said gear lever to lock it. The movable member is also provided at a rounded end with a seat 
in which the gear lever can sit when locked. This member is 
subjected to the action of a compression spring which tends to 
hold it still when cooperating with said gear lever, so locking 
it, and which opposes its release movement with a force exceeding 
that which can be exerted by the key. In this manner, said 
release is only possible by moving the movable member (by means of 
the key acting on the lever mechanism) and the gear lever 
simultaneously. This known device has various drawbacks. Firstly, as it is 
positioned to the side of the gear lever it occupies a 
considerable space within the gearshift protection part. This 
prevents its use on automobiles in which this protection part is 
of small

An antitheft device acting on a motor vehicle gear lever, 
said gear lever projecting from a usual gearshift protection part 

positioned in the vehicle passenger compartment, comprising means 
(16) movable relative to support means (10, 22) and arranged to 

cooperate operationally with said gear lever (4), said movable 
means (16) comprising counteracting means (18) arranged to 

cooperate operationally with said gear lever (4) to prevent its 
movement when the antitheft device is engaged and consequently to 

prevent use of the vehicle, said support means (10, 22) and the 
relative movable means (16) being positioned in a concealed manner 

within the gearshift protection part (3) between a usual removable 
upper closure portion (3A) thereof and a known lower part (3B), 

said movable means being operated by actuator means (37) 
controlled by a lock (29), characterised in that the movable means 

are a plate-like element (16) with one end (18) acting as 

counteracting means, said plate-like element (16) comprising a 
polygonal hole (17) containing the actuator means (37), these 

latter being an elongate element contained within said hole (17) 
and torsionally constrained at one of its ends (36) to the lock 

(29), said element (37) being positioned parallel to the sides 
(38, 42) of said hole in the direction of movement of the gear 

lever (4) when the antitheft device is engaged, said gear lever 
(4) being contained within the antitheft device and being free to 

move therein when this latter is deactivated. 
An antitheft device as claimed in claim 1, characterised 
in that the plate-like element (16) moves along guides (20) 

defined between an upper element (22) and an associated lower 
element (10), said upper and lower elements (10, 22) defining the 

support means for the movable means. 
An antitheft device as claimed in claim 1, characterised 
in that the elongate element (37) positioned within the hole (17) 

in the movable means comprises a free end (40) arranged to 
cooperate with at least two sides (41, 43) bounding said hole

An antitheft device as claimed in claim 1, characterised 
by comprising means (11) for its hooking, and means (28) for its 

fixing, to the part (3) containing the gearshift system. 
An antitheft device as claimed in claim 1, characterised 
in that that end (18) of the plate-like element (16) acting as 

counteracting means operates directly on the gear lever (4) and is 
of large width so as to cooperate with said gear lever (4) in any 

one of a plurality of positions corresponding to the selection of 
different gears. 
An antitheft device as claimed in claim 5, characterised 
in that the end (18) of the plate-like element is recessed. 
An antitheft device as claimed in claim 1, characterised 
in that the end (18) of the plate-like element (16) cooperates, in
