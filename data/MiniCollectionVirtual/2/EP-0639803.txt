<ABSTRACT>
An apparatus capable of surely removing a toner or 
similar image forming substance stably cohered to a sheet (10), 

and an apparatus for processing a sheet are disclosed. A 
liquid supply unit (30) uniformly supplies a liquid (34) to a toner 

carried on the sheet (10). The sheet infiltrated with the liquid is 
heated by a toner removing unit (40) to have to the toner thereof 

softened. As a result, the toner adheres to the surface of an 
offset member (44) implemented as a belt or a drum. The sheet 

containing the liquid therein is conveyed to the toner 
removing unit without creasing, breaking or folding.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an apparatus capable of 
surely removing a toner or similar image forming substance 
deposited stably on a sheet by a copier, facsimile machine, 
printer or similar image forming equipment, and a sheet 
processing apparatus. A method and an apparatus for removing a toner or 
similar image forming substance from a sheet, or recording, 
produced by image forming equipment have been proposed in 
various forms in the past. Among them, a toner removing 
method disclosed in, for example, Japanese Patent Laid-Open 
Publication No. 1-101576 immerses a sheet carrying a toner 
thereon in a solvent which dissolves the toner, or resin, and 
then applies ultrasonic oscillations to the sheet, thereby 
separating the toner from the sheet. In a method taught in 
Japanese Patent Laid-Open Publication No. 4-300395, a 
solvent is deposited on the printed portions of a waste sheet 
by immersion, spraying, application or similar technology so 
as to dissolve the toner. In this kind of method, the dissolved 
toner is removed by, for example, rinsing, air suction, contact  
 
with an adsorbent, mechanical or electrical separation, or 
electrostatic adsorption. Subsequently, the sheet is rolled or 
otherwise finished to be recycled. A method not using a solvent and disclosed in, for 
example, Japanese Patent Laid-Open Publication No. 2-55195 
removes a thermally fusible ink or toner deposited, by an 
electrophotographic system or a thermal transfer system, on 
a printing consisting of a substrate and a parting agent 
applied to the substrate. Specifically, this method lays an ink 
separating body on the printing, conveys them through 
between a heat roller and a press roller, and removes, after 
they have been cooled off, the ink separating body from the 
printing. As a result, the ink is transferred from the printing 
to the ink separating body. Japanese Patent Laid-Open 
Publication No. 4-64472 proposes an eraser made up of an 
endless sheet having at least the surface thereof 
implemented by a thermally fusible resin, a heat roller and a 
cool roller each being rotatable while supporting the endless 
sheet, a press roller for pressing a sheet (erasable paper), 
whose surface has been treated for parting, against the 
softened or melted resin, and a drive section for driving them. 
Further, Japanese Patent Laid-Open Publication No. 4-82983 
proposes an image forming substance removing apparatus 
having two parallel rollers rotatable in contact with each 
other and allowing a sheet to pass
