<ABSTRACT>
A vehicle seat and occupant restraint 
arrangement (7) for a vehicle (8) 

includes a seat pan member 
(2) having forward and rearward ends (4,6), a seat 

back rest frame (10) joined with the seat pan rearward 
end (6), the seat back rest frame (10) having an upper 

end (12), a D-ring (14) joined to the seat back rest 
frame (10) generally adjacent the upper end (12) of 

the seat back rest frame (10), an anchor (72) being 
generally fixed with respect to the vehicle (8), an 

occupant restraint belt (60) with a first end (80) 
operatively associated with the anchor (72), the 

restraint belt (60) being threaded through the D-ring 
(14), and a movable lock plate (38) mounted on legs of 

the D-ring (14) to catch the occupant restraint belt 
(60) upon sudden excessive acceleration of the vehicle 

(8) in the forward direction, so as to tension the 
restraint belt (60) between the D-ring (14) and the 

anchor (72) to minimise any angular movement of the 
seat back rest frame (10) rearwardly relative to the 

seat pan member (2).

<DESCRIPTION>
The field of the present invention is that 
of a vehicle seat and occupant restraint belt 
arrangement as specified in the preamble of claim 1, 
particularly for vehicle seats in the forward row 
seating of dual row seating vehicles. Most of the design restraints associated 
with vehicle seating are primarily concerned with 
preventing a vehicle seat going forward in a frontal 
impact crash of the vehicle. However, sometimes it is 
desirable to prevent a back rest of a front seat from 
possibly going rearwards in such an event. Presently, 
the main factors which prevent rearward movement of 
the seat back rest is the structural integrity of the 
seat. It is desirable to somehow utilise the occupant 
belt restraint system to aid in preventing the 
rearward movement of the seat back rest. Allowing the 
occupant restraint system to aid in preventing any 
rearward movement of the seat back rest in rear impact 
crashes would allow the vehicle seat to experience a 
reduction in mass and therefore aid in meeting the 
environmentally-mandated goal of reduction of vehicle 
weight to decrease fuel consumption, thereby helping 
to further cleanse the environment. A vehicle seat and occupant restraint 
arrangement according to the present invention is 
characterised by the features specified in the 
characterising portion of claim 1. To meet the above-noted challenges, the 
present invention, in a preferred embodiment, 
comprises a vehicle seat and restraint arrangement 
wherein a restraint belt is threaded through a D-clamp 
connected with an upper end of a seat back rest. 
Another end of the belt restraint is operatively 
associated with an anchoring mechanism which has  
 
portions positioned above and rearward of the seat 
back rest. The belt is freely allowed to move through 
the D-clamp in normal operation. Upon a sudden rear 
impact, the D-clamp closes, causing the restraint belt 
to be placed in tension between the D-clamp and the 
anchoring mechanism, which, in turn, causes a 
retention of the restraint belt to aid in the 
prevention of any possible rearward movement of the 
seat back rest in the vehicle. The invention and how it may be performed 
are hereinafter particularly described with reference 
to the accompanying drawings, in which: 
Figure 1 is a perspective view of a 
preferred embodiment of the present invention; Figure 2 is a cross-sectional view taken 
along line 2-2 of Figure 1; and Figure 3 is a perspective view taken along 
line 3-3 of Figure 2. Referring to Figures 1 to 3, a vehicle seat

A vehicle seat and occupant restraint 
arrangement (7) for a vehicle (8) having forward and 

rearward ends, in which the arrangement comprises: a 
seat pan member (2) having forward and rearward ends 

(4,6); a seat back frame (10) joined with the rearward 
end (6) of the seat pan, the seat back frame (10) 

having an upper end (12); a first anchor means (72) 
generally fixable with respect to the vehicle (8); and 

an occupant restraint belt (60) with a first end (80) 
operatively associated with the first anchor means 

(72), characterised in that the arrangement includes a 
D-ring (14) joined to the seat back frame (10) 

generally adjacent the upper end (12) of the seat back 
frame (10); the restraint belt (60) is threaded 

through the D-ring (14); and the D-ring (14) includes 
mechanism (38) operable to catch the occupant 

restraint belt (60) upon sudden excessive acceleration 
of the vehicle (8) in a forward direction so as to 

tension the restraint belt (60) between the D-ring 
(14) and the first anchor means (72) to minimise any 

angular movement of the seat back frame (10) 
rearwardly relative to the seat pan member (2). 
A vehicle seat and occupant restraint 
arrangement (7) according to claim 1, in which the 

restraint belt (60) passes through an elevated 
position relative to the D-ring (14), said position 

being located between the D-ring (14) and the first 
anchor means (72). 
A vehicle seat and occupant restraint 
arrangement (7) according to claim 2, in which the 

restraint belt (60) also extends rearwardly from the 
D-ring (14) to the first anchor means (72). 
A vehicle seat and occupant restraint 
arrangement (7) according to any one
 of claims 1 to 3, 
 

in which the mechanism (38) in the D-ring (14) is 
actuated mechanically to catch the restraint belt (60) 

upon excessive forward acceleration of the vehicle 
(8). 
A vehicle seat and occupant restraint 
arrangement (7) according to claim 1, in which the 

restraint belt (60) is also a shoulder harness. 
A vehicle seat and occupant restraint 
arrangement (7) according to any one of claims 1 to 5, 

in which the first anchor means includes a retractor 
(72) which locks the restraint belt (60) upon 

excessive forward acceleration of the vehicle (8). 
A vehicle seat and occupant restraint 
arrangement (7) according to claim 2, in which the 

elevated position between the D-ring (14) and the 
first anchor means (72) is defined by a loop (64) 

through which the belt (60) extends. 
A vehicle seat and occupant restraint 
arrangement (7) according to claim 1, in which said 

first anchor means (72) includes a retractor which 
locks upon experience of an excessive forward 

acceleration of the vehicle (8); the occupant restrain 
belt comprises a shoulder harness (60) with the first 

end (80) threaded through the D-ring (14) extending 
upwardly through a loop (64) and then being
