 S P E C I F I C A T I O NSAMPLE PREPARATION DEVICEBackground of the Invention Field of the Invention -The present invention relates generally to sample preparation devices. More particularly, the invention concerns a disposable sample preparation device which precisely measures a volume of sample, mixes it with prepackaged reagent, and then separates any resulting precipitant or particles from the sample.Discussion of the InventionThere is a substantial need in chemical analysis to perform many different types of high volume colormetric assays which require the addition of one or two reagents to a sample. These assays include: albumin, total protein, iron, phosphorous, and magnesium is serum, plasma, or urine. Adolase, amylase and acid phosphates are additional examples of enzymes which may be assayed in these body fluids. Each of these assays employs 'one or two stable reagents having a long shelf life.Recently the National Institute of Health and the Center for Disease Control has identified serum high density lipoprotein (HDL) concentration as an important indicator for coronary heart disease. Public awareness of the importance of HDL, through the National Cholesterol Education Program and other media, has created a substantial demand for this test. Prior art methods available for serum HDL measurement require intricate sample preparation procedures and the cost and accuracy of HDL measurements rely heavily upon the skills of the individual charged with the execution of sample preparation. Therefore, a substantial need exists for a device which can reduce the reliance on labor intensive sample preparation techniques for HDL measurement.A major thrust of the present invention is to provide a sample preparation device which overcomes prior art drawbacks of the character discussed in the preceding paragraph and to 

provide a simple and easy to use, yet highly accurate device, capable of accomplishing a number of different types of sample preparation tasks.Summary of the InventionIt is an object of the present invention to provide a novel sample preparation device for precisely measuring a sample volume, mixing the sample with a reagent and then, when necessary, separating out any resulting precipitant from the sample.Another object of the invention is to provide a device of the aforementioned character which is of simple construction and one which can be used by technicians of ordinary skill.Another object of the invention is to provide a device of the type described in which errors and imprecision

I CLAIM
1. A sample preparation device usable with a centrifuge for measuring the volume of a sample and, upon centrifugation, for mixing the sample with a reagent, said device comprising:
(a) a first chamber for containing the sample, said first chamber being open at one end and closed at the other end by a closure wall having a first fluid passageway therethrough ;
(b) a second chamber for containing the reagent, said second chamber having first and second portions, said second portion being in communication with said first fluid passageway; and
(c) closure means for normally closing said first passageway and for opening said first passageway in response to centrifugal forces generated during centrifugation, whereby the sample will be intermixed with the reagent.
2. A device as defined in Claim 1 in which said closure means comprises a first plug closely receivable within said first passageway.
3. A device as defined in Claim 1 in which said second portion of said second chamber is in communication with said first portion of said second chamber via a second passageway when said first passageway is open.
4. A device as defined in Claim 1 further including an overflow chamber in communication with said first chamber.
5. A device as defined in Claim 4 in which said overflow chamber circumscribes a portion of said first chamber.
6. A device as defined in Claim 4 in which said first chamber includes first and second portions in fluid communication via a second passageway disposed between said first and second portions.
7. A device as defined in Claim 6 further comprising means for closing said second passageway.
8. A sample preparation device for mixing a sample and a reagent comprising:
(a) a first container having first and second portions ; 


 (b) a second container receivable within said first container, said second container having a first and second portions, said second portion being receivable within said second portion of said first container to form a reagent chamber and an intermixing chamber, said reagent chamber and said intermixing chamber being in fluid communication; and
(c) closure.means for closing said first and second passageways.
9. A device as defined in Claim 8 in which said second container includes an internal sample chamber and in which said second container includes a third chamber disposed proximate said intermixing chamber of said first container, said third chamber being in communication with said internal sample chamber of said second container.
10. A device as defined in Claim 9 in which said closure means comprises a closure member removably receivable within said first passageway.
11. A device as defined in Claim 9 in which said internal sample chamber of said second container comprises first and second portions interconnected by a connector passageway.
12. A device as defined in Claim 11 further including closure means for closing said connector passageway.
