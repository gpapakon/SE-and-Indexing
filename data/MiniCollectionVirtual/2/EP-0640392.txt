<ABSTRACT>
The present invention provides a device and a process for detecting 
an analyte in a biological fluid. That device comprises a cover portion with 

a restricted area for sample application, a separation matrix for separation of 
the analyte from substances in the sample that can interfere with detection of 

the analyte and means for detecting the analyte. The restricted area of 
sample application is less than 90 percent of the cross-sectional area of the 

separation matrix and the separation matrix and the means for detecting 
analyte are under compression of between 14 to 43 percent. A process 

comprises applying a sample of fluid to such a device and detecting a signal 
generated from an interaction between the analyte and the detection means in 

the device.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a device and a process for detecting
an analyte in a biological fluid. That device comprises a cover portion with
a restricted area for sample application, a separation matrix for separation of
the analyte from substances in the sample that interfere with detection of the
analyte, means for detecting the analyte and a base portion having a window
or opening for measuring the analyte. A process comprises applying a
sample of fluid to such a device and detecting a signal generated from an
interaction between the analyte and the detection means in the device.There is a need in the analyte detection art for devices and methods
that allow for the rapid, accurate determination of biological fluid analyte
composition in very small sample sizes. The need for a device using small
sample volumes is particularly relevant to the detection of blood analyte
composition because of the difficulty and inconvenience of obtaining blood
samples from subjects.Currently available such devices include ACCUCHEK EASY TEST
STRIPS™ and ACCUTREND® (Boehringer Mannheim Corp.). Those
devices are multilayer reagent systems characterized by non-restricted
application-site sizes.EP 452 740 describes a multi-layer device for diagnostic assays. EP 212
634 describes a test strip with a defined sample absorption capacity. EP 511 120 is
related to a testing device wherein the multi-layer is harboured in a special retaining
number.The present invention provides a detection device having a limited
application area compared to an underlying separation matrix, which serves
to reduce the volume of fluid and time needed for analyte detection. In
addition, the separation matrix and underlying detection means are
maintained under a required compression state of 14 to 43 percent, based on 
an uncompressed relaxed state. Preferably, the compression is between 20
and 35 percent that of a relaxed (uncompressed) state.In one aspect, the present invention contemplates a device for
assaying an analyte in a biological fluid, which device comprises:
a) a base portion having a transparent window or opening;b) means for detecting an analyte vertically adjacent to and at
least partially coincident with that window or opening;c) a separation matrix vertically adjacent to and substantially
coincident with the detection means such that the analyte can move from the
separation matrix to the detection means; andd) a cover portion having an aperture, the cross-sectional area of
which aperture is less than about 90 percent of the
