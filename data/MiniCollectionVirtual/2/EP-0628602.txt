<ABSTRACT>
The present invention relates to a polyamide composition including a semicrystalline polyamide and a sufficient quantity of amorphous polyamide to make it transparent and capable of being heat-treated without deformation, resulting from the blending of its constituents at a temperature above or equal to approximately 300@C and from a conversion at a temperature above or equal to approximately 300@C. The present composition has good dimensional stability and is employed for the manufacture of objects.
