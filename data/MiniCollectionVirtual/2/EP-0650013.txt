<ABSTRACT>
A solid particulate fuel/air burner has opposing 
fluted members (20) within a rectangular conduit (16) 

which in operation forms a nozzle. Splitter plates (30) 
with the fluted members (20) define passages through 

which a particulate solid fuel and air flow to a 
combustion chamber. The passages so defined provide and 

control separate streams of the mix such that flame 
retention at the exit of the conduit (16) is achieved and 

reduced NOx is produced and the gathering of ash in the 
conduit (16) avoided by the obviation of recirculation of 

the products of combustion into the conduit.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to burners of the kind
used in industrial boilers. Such burners receive flows
of particulate coal and air and burn it in a combustion
chamber via which the resulting heat is conducted to
water so as to produce steam for driving a turbine.Environmental needs dictate that burners of the kind
described hereinbefore, are designed so that the
production of pollutants, especially NOx, is at least
minimised during operation of the burner.It has been ascertained that if the burner flame can
be persuaded to remain attached to the outlet plane of
the burner nozzle, this feature when used in conjunction
with the correct fuel/airflow characteristics, enables a
considerable reduction in the amount of NOx produced,
relative to previous burners. One way of achieving this
result is disclosed and claimed in European Patent
Application EP0343767A, which is in common ownership with
the present invention.Devices of the kind referred to hereinbefore, can be
prevented from working efficiently by build up of
products of combustion in the form of ash, within the
flow passages of the burner. Flow disturbance results
which can prevent flame retention at the nozzle outlet
plane, and in any event, could force a shut down of the
associated plant for cleaning purposes.The present invention seeks to provide an improved
solid fuel burner.According to the present invention, a solid fuel
burner comprises a hollow structure having an inlet
connectable to particulate solid fuel and air delivery
means and including a conduit, tapered fluted means are
provided in the conduit, the fluted means having troughs
which are deepest at the outlet end of the conduit, a
splitter plate adjacent the troughs spans the interior of
the hollow structure to define passage portions
characterised in that the conduit diverges from axis from 
said inlet to an outlet thereof, the fluted means being
provided on the inner wall of the conduit, the fluted
means having troughs which diverge from the axis of the
conduit at a larger angle than the angle at which the
conduit diverges which in operation cause a reduction in
velocity of a particulate solid fuel/air flow passing
therethrough to ensure flame retention on the planer
downstream ends of the flutes and non breakaway of the
particulate solid fuel/airflow from the surfaces of the
troughs thereof, so as to avoid ash recirculation.The invention will now be described by way of
example and with reference to the accompanying drawings
in which:-Fig 1 is a view on a burner in accordance

<CLAIMS>
A solid fuel burner comprising a hollow structure
(10) having an inlet connectable to particulate solid

fuel and air delivery means (18) and including a conduit
(16), tapered fluted means (20) are provided in the

conduit (16), the fluted means (20) having troughs (22)
which are deepest at the outlet end of the conduit (16),

a splitter plate (30) adjacent the troughs (22) spans the
interior of the hollow structure (10) to define passage

portions characterised in that the conduit (16) diverges
from axis (12) from said inlet to an outlet thereof, the

fluted means being provided on the inner wall of the
conduit (16), the fluted means having troughs (22) which

diverge from the axis (12) of the conduit (16) at a
larger angle than the angle at which the conduit (16)

diverges which in operation cause a reduction in velocity
of a particulate solid fuel/air flow passing therethrough

to ensure flame retention on the planer downstream ends
of the flutes (20) and non breakaway of the particulate

solid fuel/airflow from the surfaces of the troughs (22)
thereof, so as to avoid ash recirculation.

(20) diverge from the axis (12) of the burner.
A solid fuel burner as claimed in claim 1 or claim 2
characterised in that crests (24) of the fluted means

(20) and the splitter plate (30) converge towards the
axis (12) of the burner.
