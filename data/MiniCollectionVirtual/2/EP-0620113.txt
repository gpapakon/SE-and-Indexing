<CLAIMS>
Use of a stretched film having at least two layers and 
predominantly consisting of polypropylene and 

characterised in that it has at least one reflection-reduced 
surface, which has been corona or flame 

pretreated and is very readily bondable, the surface 
gloss of which is less than 60 gloss units, measured 

to DIN 67 530, and that haze of the film, measured to 
ASTM D 1003, is less than 40% as a window film for 

envelopes. 
Use according to claim 1, characterised in that the 
reflection-reduced layer is of the following 

composition: 

5 to 60 wt.% of an ethylene-based copolymer modified 
with polar groups, 
5 to 15 wt.% of a random copolymer prepared from 
propylene and ethylene with an ethylene content of 2 

to 6 wt.%,
 
and 
25 to 90 wt.% of polypropylene copolymers produced by 
block copolymerisation. 
Use according to one of the preceding claims, 
characterised in that the film has a thickness of at 

least 10 µm. 
Use according to one of the preceding claims, 
characterised in that the reflection-reduced layer has 

a thickness of 1 to 4 µm.  
 
Use according to one of the preceding claims, 
characterised in that the film has a second outer 

layer containing antiblocking agents. 
Use according to one of the preceding claims, 
characterised in that the film contains lubricants, 

antistatic agents and antiblocking agents. 
Use according to one of the preceding claims, 
characterised in that the core layer predominantly 

consists of polypropylene. 
Use according to one of the preceding claims, 
characterised in that the film has more than three 

layers. 
Use according to claims 1 to 8, characterised in that, 
instead of corona or flame pretreatment, the film has 

been subjected to fluorine pretreatment.
