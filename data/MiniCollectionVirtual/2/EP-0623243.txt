<DESCRIPTION>
 INTEGRATION OF TRANSISTORS WITH VERTICAL CAVITY SURFACE EMITTING LASERSCROSS REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS This application is related to our co-pending application serial No. 07/790,964, filed November 7, 1991, for "Visible Light Surface Emitting Semiconductor Laser" and to our application serial no. , filed concurrently herewith, for "Vertical-Cavity Surface Emitting Laser Optical Interconnect Technology," which are incorporated herein by reference.FIELD OF THE INVENTION This relates to the integration of semiconductor lasers with electronic devices. In particular, it relates to vertically arranged heterostructure lasers and their integration with devices such as transistors.BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION Conventional edge-emitting laser diodes are well known. In these diodes, laser radiation is emitted in a plane that is a continuation of the plane of the p-n junction that forms the diode. Different types of these diodes are widely used to provide laser radiation in the infrared and visible regions. While these diodes have enjoyed considerable commercial success, they are relatively large and, as a result, are difficult to integrate with other devices.Recently, a new class of semiconductor lasers known as a vertical cavity surface emitting laser has been developed. Unlike the edge-emitting laser, these vertical cavity lasers emit laser radiation in the direction perpendicular to the plane of the p-n 

 junction formed in the laser diode. Considerable information concerning the structure and formation of such laser diodes is set forth, for example, in U.S. Patent 4,949,350; in J. Jewell et al., "Microlasers, 5 " Scientific American, Vol. 265, No. 5, pp. 86-94(November 1991); in J.
