<ABSTRACT>
A cord locking device of this invention comprises 
a casing (1) having openings (4, 5) respectively 

at opposite ends and a longitudinal aperture (8) in 
a front plate (7), and a slide (2) adapted to be inserted 

in the casing (1). The slide (2) has a pair of 
resilient grip portions (10) extending from opposite 

sides of a head portion (9) of the slide (2), and also 
has a pair of engaging portions (14) each extending 

from a side surface of the slide (2) between the head 
portion (9) and a base of each of the grip portions 

(10). In order to increase the resilience, the 
slide (2) further has a resilient portion (11) 

situated between the grip portions (10). The slide 
(2) additionally has a central resilient guide portion 

(13) situated rearwardly of the head portion (9) in 
such a manner that the guide portion (13) should project 

outwardly from an outer surface of the front 
plate (7) of the casing (1) through the aperture (8) 

when the slide (2) is inserted in the casing (1). For 
locking and unlocking the cord (20), the slide (2) is 

slided with the gripping of the grip portions (10). 
When the guide portion (13) is depressed in the aperture 

(8), the slide (2) can be removed from the casing (1) 
for exchanging the cord (20) with a new one.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a cord locking device 
of synthetic resin for locking a cord to fasten an 
anorak, a rucksack, a life jacket, a shopping back, 
etc. This type of prior art cord locking device is 
exemplified by Japanese Patent Laid-Open Publication 
No. SHO 54-138799. This cord locking device comprises, 
as shown in FIG. 6 of the accompanying drawings, a 
tapering casing A, which opens at opposite ends and 
has a pair of parallel side walls C at the wide open 
end, and a slide B adapted to be slidably inserted in 
the casing A. The casing A has in a front plate thereof 
a longitudinal aperture D. The slide B has a head 
portion E, a neck portion F, a ring-shape grip 
portion G extending from one end of the neck portion 
F, and a pair of resilient slanting portions H 
projecting from opposite sides of a base of the neck 
portion F. The slide B has a saw-toothed surface J on 
each of opposite side of the head portion E. Each of 
the slanting portion H also has a saw-toothed surface 
K on its free end. Further, the slide B has a projection 
L extending between the head portion E and the  
 
neck portion F in such a manner that the projection L 
is received through the aperture D when the slide B is 
inserted in the casing A, so that the slide B is 
slidable within a limited range. As two parts of a 
cord are inserted through the gaps between the slide 
B and the repective side walls C of the casing A, the 
cord is locked by the saw-toothed surfaces J, K of the 
head portion E and the slanting portions H. U.S. Pat. No. 4102019 also discloses a cord locking 
device of this kind. In the disclosed cord locking 
device, a resilient grip portion is bent and inserted 
in a casing in such a manner that a projection on the 
grip portion is slidably received in an aperture of 
the casing. A cord is fastened and locked between 
engaging projections on outer surfaces of the grip 
portion and opposite side walls of the casing. Another cord locking device is known (Japanese 
Utility Model Publication No. HEI 2-46731) in which a 
slide is inserted in a casing in such a manner that a 
resilient guide projecting from the front surface of 
the slide is received in an aperture of the front 
plate of the casing, locking a cord between the opposite 
side walls of the casing and the side surfaces of 
the slide. With the first-named known cord locking device, 
as shown in FIG. 6, when the cord is pulled leftwardly 
of the casing A, the slide B will be brought toward  
 
the narrow open end of the casing A to fasten the
