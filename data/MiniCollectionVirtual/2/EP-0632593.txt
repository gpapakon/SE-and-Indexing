<ABSTRACT>
A capacitive sensor circuit comprises: a sensor electrode (16) forming a 
first plate of a sensing capacitor (14) relative to a reference terminal (10), a first (2) and 

a second (26) inverting Schmitt trigger having the same threshold voltages. A feedback 
resistor (8) provides feedback from the output (6) to the input (4) of the first trigger (2), 

which together with the sensing capacitor (14) forms an oscillator whose frequency 
depends on the magnitude of the sensing capacitor (14). The input (24) of the second 

trigger (26) is connected to the output of the first trigger (2) 
via
 a series resistor (22) 
and to the reference terminal (10) 
via
 a reference capacitor (30). The resistance values 
of the feedback resistor (8) and the series resistor (22) are equal. A d.c. signal will 

appear on the output (32) of the second trigger if the capacitance of the sensing 
capacitor (14) is smaller than the capacitance of the reference capacitor (30) and an a.c. 

signal in the opposite case.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a capacitive sensor circuit comprising: a sensor 
electrode forming a first plate of a sensing capacitor; a first amplifier, constituting an inverting amplifier having 
an input connected to the sensor electrode and having an output; a second amplifier, 
having an input coupled to the output of the first amplifier and having an 
output; a feedback resistor connected between the output and the input of the first 
inverting amplifier. Such a sensor circuit is known from European Patent Application No. EP 
0,524,708, where the circuit is used to turn on a personal-care apparatus when it is 
lifted by the user of the apparatus and to turn off the apparatus when the apparatus is 
put down. The sensor electrode, the first inverting amplifier and the feedback resistor 
form an oscillator, also referred to as an astable multivibrator, whose oscillation 
frequency is dictated inter alia by the value of the feedback resistor and by the 
magnitude of the capacitance between the sensor electrode and the signal earth terminal 
of the capacitive sensor circuit. The oscillation frequency decreases as the capacitance 
increases. When the user picks up the apparatus the capacitance relative to earth is 
comparatively high and the frequency is comparatively low. If the apparatus has been 
put down the capacitance relative to earth is comparatively low and the frequency is 
comparatively high. The frequency difference or the frequency ratio between the 
comparatively low and the comparatively high oscillator frequency is measured by 
means of a frequency-to-voltage converter and is converted into a voltage difference, 
which energises a switch to turn on the apparatus. The second amplifier then serves as a 
buffer between the oscillating first inverting amplifier and the frequency-to-voltage 
converter. This known capacitive sensor circuit is fairly susceptible to spreads in 
properties and values of the components used. It is known, inter alia from European 
Patent Specification EP 0,104,422, to compare the oscillation frequency with that of a 
second oscillator which comprises a reference capacitance relative to earth. The 
capacitance of the sensor electrode is compared with the capacitance of the reference 
capacitor by means of a frequency measurement. A gate circuit provides a signal which  
 
is a measure of the oscillation frequencies. This known solution can be accurate but 
requires the use of a gate circuit or some other coincidence circuit. It is an object of the invention to provide a
