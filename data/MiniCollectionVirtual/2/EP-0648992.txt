<ABSTRACT>
The device of the invention includes a thermistor (T1) upstream of the drying tub (2) and another thermistor downstream. These thermistors are connected to a regulation device of the proportional derivative type, controlling a cut-off supply (4) which varies the heating energy (5) of the drying air as a function of the difference between the measured value and a set value. Application: washing/drying machine (washer-dryer).

Method for drying articles with the help of a hot air
current, characterised by periodically measuring the

temperature of said air current from the start of the
drying process at at least one point of the air current,

by deducing therefrom the temperature gradient of said
air, and by regulating the quantity of energy sent to the

air heating circuit as a direct function of the difference
between the measured temperature and a reference value,

and as an inverse function of the temperature gradient of
the drying air.
Method according to claim 1, characterised by the
fact that the regulation is of the proportional/derivative

type.
Method according to claim 1, characterised by the
fact that the regulation is of the

proportional/integral/derivative type.
Method according to claim 1, characterised by the
fact that the regulation is of the proportional type.
Method according to claim 1, characterised by the
fact that the regulation is of the fuzzy logic type.
Method according to any of the preceding claims,
characterised by acting upon the gradient by varying the

quantity of energy sent to the drying air heating device.
Method according to claim 6, characterised by the
fact that the heating device is supplied with a voltage

whose cyclic ratio and/or frequency is varied.
Method according to any of the preceding claims,
characterised by the fact that the measurement of the 

drying air current temperature is performed periodically,
and that the measured value is taken to be the mean value

at each measurement period.
Method according to any of the preceding claims,
characterised in that the drying air temperature is

measured upstream and downstream of the articles to be
dried.
Method according to claims 7 and 9, characterised by
by varying the value of the reference temperature as a

function of the difference between the upstream and
downstream measurements.
Device for regulating the drying air heating
temperature in a machine for drying articles, having an

enclosure (2) containing the articles to be dried and into
which the drying air is passed, and having at least one

regulating device (3), which in turn is connected to the

control input of a device (4) for providing a variable
power supply to a device (5) for heating the drying air,

characterised in that the regulating device has means for
computing mean temperatures and for computing differences

between successive mean temperatures, and means for
determining the temperature gradient of the drying air,

and in that the regulating device regulates, from the
start of the drying process, the quantity of energy sent

to the heating device as a direct function of the
difference between the measured temperature and a

reference value, and as an inverse function of the
temperature gradient of the drying air.
