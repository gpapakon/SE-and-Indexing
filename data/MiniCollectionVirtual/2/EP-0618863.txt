<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a waste compactor, in particular 
for compaction of bulk waste and garbage material such as 
plastics, paper, cardboard, wood and other compressible 
articles generally in a container such as a bag, box or a 
bin, for example, for disposal or recycling purposes. The invention relates to a waste compactor of the type 
comprising an upwardly open waste container, a roller 
mounted on a support for movement within the container to 
travel over waste in the container for waste compaction, 
the roller being movable up and down in the container as 
waste builds up in the container, the support comprising 
a support frame and a support arm mounted on the support 
frame for extension into the container, the roller being 
carried on the support arm. Waste compactors of this type 
are particularly suitable for compaction of waste on site 
as it is generated. They are generally convenient for 
loading and the compacted waste can usually safely and 
easily be removed without any significant "spring-back" or 
movement of the waste as is sometimes the case with press 
type compactors. One such device is described in German Patent 
Specification No. DE 2,655,314 having a roller mounted on 
an arm within a container at a lower end of a screw which 
feeds waste to the roller for compaction. For pressing 
the roller against the garbage either the container may be 
fixed and the roller moved down onto the waste or the 
container may be raised up against the roller, the 
movement being affected by means of a piston or spring. 
The device is, however, somewhat complex and is unsuitable 
for relatively bulky waste materials which need to be 
broken up prior to feeding them into the compactor.  
 Another device of this type is described in patent 
specification No. EP 0,106,268. In this case, the roller 
is mounted on a vertical support arm which is supported 
co-axially within the container, the roller and support 
arm being freely movable axially within the container. 
The pressing of the roller against the waste is effected 
by only the weight of the roller acting on the surface of 
the waste within the container. Similar pressing arrangements have been used in silage 
presses for a long time. Such an arrangement works 
reasonably effectively for a generally uniform material to 
which the construction of the roller can be matched. 
However, with a wide range of garbage or other waste 
materials as is often the case the operation may be 
somewhat unsatisfactory. With easily compressed materials 
the

<CLAIMS>
A waste compactor (1, 80, 100, 120) of the type 
comprising an upwardly open waste container (3, 60, 

83, 121), a roller (5, 91, 103, 122) mounted on a 
support for movement within the container to travel 

over waste (7) in the container for waste compaction, 
the roller being movable up and down in the container 

as waste builds up in the container, the support 
comprising a support frame (4) and a support arm (6) 

mounted on the support frame (4) for extension into 
the container, the roller (5, 91, 103, 122) being 

carried on the support arm (6), characterised in that 
the support arm (6) is inclined downwardly from the 

support frame (4) towards the roller (5, 91, 103, 
122) and the roller is mounted by a carrier arm (24) 

on the support arm (6), the carrier arm (24) being 
rotatable about a central axis of the container, 

carrier arm drive means (28) being provided for 
rotation of the carrier arm (24) about the central 

axis of the container. 
A waste compactor (1, 80, 100, 120) as claimed in 
claim 1 wherein a ram (12) is provided for movement 

of the roller (5, 91, 103, 122) through the container 
(3, 60, 101, 121), the ram being operable to move the 

roller and to apply a bias to the roller to control 
the compaction pressure applied to the waste by the 

roller. 
A waste compactor (1, 80, 100, 120) as claimed in 
claim 2 wherein the roller (5, 91, 103, 122) is 

movable against a preset ram bias to maintain a 
substantially constant pre-set desirable roller 

compaction pressure on the waste during operation.  
 
A waste compactor (1, 80, 100, 120) as claimed in 
claim 2 or 3 wherein the ram (12) applies a ram force 

which is adjustable. 
A waste compactor (1, 80, 100, 120) as claimed in any 
of claims 2 to 4 wherein the support arm (6) is 

slidably mounted on the support frame (4) and the ram 
(12) is mounted between the support arm (6) and the 

support frame (4) for sliding the arm (6) on the 
support frame (4). 
A waste compactor (1, 80, 100, 120) as claimed in any 
of claims 2 to 5 wherein a shock absorber (16) is 

provided between the ram (12) and the roller (5, 91, 
103, 122) to absorb shock loading on the roller. 
A waste compactor (1, 80, 100, 120) as claimed in any 
preceding claim wherein the drive means (28) is 

reversible in response to the force exerted on the 
roller by waste within the container resisting roller 

movement. 
A waste compactor (1, 80, 100, 120) as claimed in any 
preceding claim wherein a roller drive means (25) 

comprises an hydraulic roller motor (25) mounted on 
the carrier arm (24), a rotary hydraulic distributor 

(19) being mounted between the carrier arm (24) and 
the support arm (6) for oil passage between an 

hydraulic power supply and the roller motor (25) to 
drive the motor (25), and preferably the distributor 

(19) comprises a cylindrical body (20) having a bore 
(21), a shaft (22) rotatably mounted within the bore 

(21), a free end of the shaft (22) projecting 
outwardly of the bore (21), the carrier arm (24) 

being mounted at the free end, an oil supply port 
(26) and an oil return port (26) in a sidewall of the  

 
body (20), each port (26) communicating with an 

associated annular oil channel (26a) extending around 
the bore (21), an oil passage (27) extending through 

the shaft (22) between each channel (26a) and free 
outer end of the shaft (22) for oil delivery to and 

from the motor (25). 
A waste compactor as claimed in any preceding claim 
wherein the roller 91, 103 is a generally conical 

roller.
