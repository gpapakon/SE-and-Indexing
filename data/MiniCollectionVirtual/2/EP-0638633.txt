<ABSTRACT>
A used lubricating oil comprising lube oil 
additives, including zinc dithiophosphate is subjected 

to reclaiming. Zinc dithiophosphate is thermally 
decomposed at a temperature of 400°F (204°C) to 1000°F 

(538°C) for a residence time of 10 to 120 minutes. The 
resulting oil is subjected to vacuum distillation. A 

zinc-free (i.e. ash free by ASTM D-482) distillate oil 
is useful as marine diesel fuel. About 5 to 25 vol % is 

recovered as a metal containing bottoms product, useful 

as asphalt extender. The process is carried out in the 
absence of chemical demetallizing.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a process for
reclaiming used lubricating oil. More particularly this
invention relates to reclaiming used lubricating oil
containing organo-metallic additives to produce a
metal-free distillate oil.Automotive lubricating oils are one product of
crude petroleum. Typically, these oils are made by
fractionation, refining and dewaxing to yield the
lubricating oil. Alternatively, a narrower boiling range
lubricating oil, termed synthetic oil, is produced from
the polymerization of petroleum derived monomers.Most lubricating oils are derived from waxy
petroleum distillate oils. Such waxy petroleum distillate
oils have a viscosity of less than 50 SUS at 38°C (100°F)
and have a boiling range of 600°F to 650°F (315°C to
343°C) to 1050°F to 1100°F (566°C to 593°C). Such waxy
petroleum distillate oils may be derived from raw lube
oils the major portion of which boil above 650°F (343°C).
These raw lube oils are vacuum distilled with overhead and
side draw-offs and a bottom stream referred to as residual
oil. Considerable overlap in boiling ranges between
distillates and the residual oil may exist depending upon
distillation efficiency. Some heavier distillates have
almost the same distribution of molecular species as the
residual oil. Both paraffinic and naphthenic crude oils
are used as sources of lube oils with paraffinic crudes
giving the best yields of high viscosity index product,
hence these are preferred for most lubricating oils. Such distillates contain aromatic and polar
compounds which are undesirable in lubricating oils.
These compounds are removed by means such as solvent
extraction, hydrogenation and other means well known in
the art, either before or after dewaxing.The wax content of a waxy distillate oil is
defined by the amount of material removed to produce a
dewaxed oil with a selected pour point temperature in the
range of +25°F to -40°F (-3.9°C to -40°C). Wax content of
waxy distillate oil can vary in the range of 5 wt% to
50 wt%. Distillate oil is dewaxed by solvent dewaxing or
catalytic dewaxing processes. The dewaxed product is
referred to as a lubricating oil base stock and is
suitable for blending with other base stocks to achieve a
desired viscosity.Synthetic base lubricating oils may include
poly-α-olefin oils, ester (diester and polyolester oils),
polyalkylene glycol oils or mixtures having a kinematic
viscosity of 4 cSt to 50 cSt at 100°C, typically 4 cSt to
30 cSt at 100°C. These synthetic base oils are inherently
free of sulfur, phosphorus and

<CLAIMS>
A process for reclaiming used lubricating
oil comprising organo-metallic compounds including zinc

dithiophosphate in a concentration of 0.01 wt% or more,
comprising heating the used lubricating oil to an additive

decomposition temperature of 400°F (204°C) to 1000°F
(538°C), and maintaining the additive decomposition

temperature for a residence time in the range of 10 to
120 minutes, thereby reducing the zinc dithiophosphate

concentration to 0.001 wt% or less in the absence of
chemical demetallizing agents, characterised in that the oil

is first heated by direct heat exchange by admixing with a
heated product oil to form an admixture to produce an

additive decomposition temperature of 400°F (204°C) to 1000°F
(523°C) and thereafter heated by indirect heat exchange.
A process as claimed in Claim 1, which
comprises the further steps of:


(a) vacuum distilling the resultant oil at a
distillation temperature of 400°F (204°C)

to 1050°F (565°C) and a distillation
pressure of 20 to 500 mm Hg, and
(b) recovering a distillate product comprising
0.001 wt% or less zinc dithiophosphate, and

an asphaltic bottoms product comprising
zinc containing degradation products.
A process as claimed in Claim 2, wherein the
distillation pressure is 50 to 150 mm Hg.
A process as claimed in Claim 2 or Claim 3,
wherein the distillation temperature is from 500°F (260°C) to

750°F (399°C).
A process as claimed in any one of Claims 2 to 4
carried out as a continuous process.
A process as claimed in any one of Claims 1 to 5,
wherein the used lubricating oil prior to admixture is at

atmospheric temperature.
A process as claimed in any one of Claims 1 to 6,
wherein the volumetric ratio of used lubricating oil:heated

product oil is 1:1 to 1:120.
A process as claimed in any one of Claims 1 to 7,
which comprises admixing the distillate product with a liquid

fuel selected from marine diesel fuel, naphtha, gasoline,
kerosene, No. 2 fuel oil, No. 6 fuel oil and mixtures

thereof.
