<ABSTRACT>
The apparatus encodes (12) a digital video signal (SDV) and 
successively supplies frames of video data corresponding to the encoded 

digital video signal which are intermittently or partially scrambled 
(21). Each frame of video data has a respective frame number and 

respective blocks of video data, and each block of video data has a 
respective block number. Frame-scramble-off data is added (13) to each 

frame which has a frame number equal to one of a plurality of 
predetermined frame numbers, and block-scramble-off data is added (13) 

to each block which has a block number equal to one of a plurality of 
predetermined block numbers. A frame of video data is scrambled in the 

intermittent scrambling mode if it does not have the frame-scramble-off 
data and each block of video data is scrambled in the partial scramble 

mode if it does not have the block-scramble-off data. The scrambled 
frames or blocks of video data and the frames or blocks which are not 

scrambled are supplied as the scrambled digital video signal (DSVX). 
The scrambled digital video signal is descrambled by receiving frames 

of video data of the scrambled signal, where each frame has either 
frame scramble-on data or frame scramble-off data, and respective 

blocks of video data, where each block has either block scramble-on 
data or block scramble-off data. Each block which has the block 

scramble-on data of those frames which have the frame scramble-on data 
are then descrambled to provide a descrambled digital video signal.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to apparatus for scrambling digital
video data and, more particularly, apparatus for intermittently
scrambling or partially scrambling digital video data where in the
intermittent mode each frame is or is not scrambled depending upon its
frame number, and in the partial scramble mode each block of data in
each frame is or is not scrambled or not scrambled depending upon its
block number.It is known that when an analog video signal representing a video
image is transmitted, the video image formed by the information
contained in the received video signal is of a lesser quality than the
original video image. This usually is due to noise, reduction in the
signal to noise ratio, etc. In order to solve this problem to improve
the quality of the video signal that is received, it is known to
convert the analog video signal to a digital video signal prior to
transmission. The digital video signal usually is encoded in a
predetermined format prior to transmission and then decoded back to its
original non-encoded form after reception.One example of such a format is shown in Fig. 1. As shown, each
video frame of video data of the encoded signal includes a frame header
followed by blocks of video data, wherein each video data block
includes a block header and block data. Image information provided in
the original video signal is stored in the block data portion of each
data block. Each frame header and block header includes information
such as synchronizing data, frame number, line number of a frame, etc.In addition to digitizing and encoding a video signal prior to
transmission, the video signal may also be compressed in order to
reduce the amount of data to be transmitted, which results in more
efficient transmission of video signals. One method of compressing
data is interframe coding wherein the difference between pixel values
or block values of the current video frame and the preceding video
frame is calculated to produce a resultant interframe-coded frame of
video data. Data in other video frames (e.g., succeeding frames) may
also be utilized to generate each interframe-coded frame.When a video signal is interframe coded and then transmitted, the
received signal must be decoded in conformity with the interframe coded
format. That is, when decoding each interframe-coded frame,
information from other frames must also be utilized and decoded in 
order to decode the successive, received frame. One problem that
exists when transmitting interframe-coded signals is the possibility of
