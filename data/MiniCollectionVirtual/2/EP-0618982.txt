<ABSTRACT>
A DNA probe specific for A. salmonicida is disclosed. The probe can be used in methods of detecting or determining A. salmonicida in a locus comprising screening with the probe a sample of material taken from the locus containing or suspected of containing A. salmonicida. The sample can be water, a bacterial culture, fish tissue, salmonid faeces or a sample derived from sediment, influent or effluent from a locus used in the rearing of salmonids.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a specific probe and the use thereof in 
studying the ecology of an organism and the etiology of disease caused 
by said organism. More particularly, the invention relates to a DNA 
probe specific for Aeromonas salmonicida and to the use of said probe 
in the ecology of A. salmonicida and the etiology of furunculosis. A. salmonicida is the causal agent of furunculosis, a disease 
which affects many species of fish and is of major importance in 
salmonid farming. The absence of an efficient selective medium and its 
poor plating efficiency in mixed cultures (McCarthy, D.H., in Aquatic 
Microbiology, Society for Applied Bacteriology Symposium Series, 
F.A. Skinner and J.M. Shewan (ed.), Academic Press, New York, N.Y. 
(1977) 6, 299) has severely hampered the study of the ecology of this 
organism and the epidemiology of furunculosis. The assumption that 
the organism is an obligate pathogen of fish (Popoff, M.Y., in N.R. 
Krieg and J.G. Holt (ed.), Bergey's Manual of Systematic 
Bacteriology, The Williams and Wilkins Co., Baltimore, (1984) 1, and 
Richards, R.H. and R.J. Roberts, in R.J. Roberts (ed.), Fish Pathology, 
Balliere Tindall, London, (1978) 196) may be an artefact of the limited 
ability of classical bacteriological techniques to detect the organism in 
natural environments. Studies based on DNA hybridization (Maclnnes, 
J.I., et al. Can. J. Micro. (1979) 25, 579-586) and restriction fragment 
length polymorphisms (Hennigan, M., et al. Can. J. Fish. Aquat. Sci, 
(1989) 46, 877-879) have shown that A. salmonicida is a highly 
homogenous taxon in the genus Aeromonas which is classified as a 
member of the family Vibrionaceae.A DNA probe specific to A. salmonicida would facilitate studies 
on the ecology of that organism and the etiology of furunculosis. The invention provides a DNA probe specific for A. salmonicida 
corresponding to a DNA fragment having the sequence indicated in the 
Sequence Listing (SEQ ID NO:1), a sequence complementary thereto 
or a portion of either sequence. The probe according to the invention can be generated by a 
method comprising the following steps:- 
a) preparing a gene bank of A. salmonicida;b) screening said gene bank in parallel with radiolabelled 
total DNA probes from each of A. salmonicida and A. 
Hydrophila by defferential hybridization; c) selecting a clone which hybridizes with said radiolabelled 
probe from A. salmonicida but which does not hybridize 
with said radiolabelled probe from A. hydrophila; d) isolating the insert from
