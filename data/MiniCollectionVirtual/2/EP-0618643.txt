<ABSTRACT>
A flexible board electrical connector includes a 
housing having an opening on an upper corner and a plurality 

of contact channels on the opening; a plurality of contact 
elements fitted in the contact channels such that spring 

contact portions thereof exposed in the opening; a pressure 
member attached to the housing for rotation between a closed 

position where it is brought into contact with the contact 
elements and an open position where it is apart from the 

contact elements; and a pressure edge provided on the 
pressure member at such a position that when the pressure 

member is in the open position, it is in a first position 
outside from a line including the turning center of the 

pressure member and the contact portion of a contact 
element and when the pressure member is turned to the 

closed position, it is moved to a second position inside 
from the line so that once the pressure member is turned to 

the closed position, the pressure member is urged to the 
closed position by reactive forces of the contact portions 

and the flexible board.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to electrical
connectors for connecting flexible boards to circuit
boards.Japanese patent application Kokoku No. 3-051,257
discloses a so-called forceless connector for
connecting a flexible board to a circuit board such as
shown Figs. 1 and 2. The connector includes a housing
51 having an opening at the upper right-hand corner. A
pressure member 52 is attached to the housing 51 for
rotation to cover the opening. The pressure member 52
is rotatable clockwise to a closed position as shown in
Fig. 2 such that the front concave surface 53 of the pressure
member 52 slides on the convex surface 54 of the
housing 51. When the pressure member 52 rotates to
the closed position, a latch claw 56 engages a latch
shoulder 57 of the housing 51 to hold the pressure
member in the closed position.A number of contact elements 55 are
arranged within the housing 51 in the direction perpendicular
to the paper sheet. A contact portion 58 of each
contact member 55 is bent in a U-shaped form so as to
provide a spring property and has a front end extending
diagonally upwardly toward the pressure member 52. A
connection portion 59 is bent in an L-shaped form so as
to extend downwardly through the housing 51 and an
aperture P1 of a circuit board P.In operation, the pressure member 52 is
turned to the open position, and a flexible board F is
inserted into the connector such that it slides on the
lower surface of the pressure member 52 as shown in
Fig. 1. Then, the pressure member 52 is turned clockwise
to the closed position as shown in Fig. 2. Consequently,
the pressure member 52 presses the flexible
board F against the front ends 58 of the contact elements
55 so that the circuit conductors on the lower side
of the flexible board F are brought into contact with the
corresponding contact elements 55 while the latch claw
56 engages the latch shoulder 57 to hold the connection
between the flexible board F and the contact elements
55.In the above connector, however, the thickness
of the pressure member 52 between the center of
rotation of the pressure member 52 and the front ends
58 of the contact elements 55 increases toward the outside
of the connector so that the pressure member 52
can open if the engagement between the latch claw 56
and the latch shoulder 57 is incomplete.In order to prevent such a problem, the latch
claw and shoulder must be sufficiently large to ensure
the engagement. Such large latch claw and shoulder
provided on the aide of the connector make the connector
itself larger.Japanese

An electrical connector suitable for pressing down a flexible board
comprising:


a substantially rectangular housing (81; 111; 131) having an opening on an
upper corner, a pair of support members (82, 82; 112, 112; 132, 132) on opposite

sides of said opening, and a plurality of support channels (84; 114; 141) between
said support members (82, 82; 112, 112; 132, 132);
a plurality of contact elements (85; 115; 135) fitted in said supported
channels (84; 114; 141) in said opening such that spring contact portions (89; 120;

140) of said contact elements (85; 115; 135) are exposed in said opening;
a pressure member (90, 124; 147) supported by said support
members (82, 82; 112, 112; 132, 132) for rotation about a turning center (87; 121;

145) between a closed position where it is brought into contact with a flexible board
(F) and an open position where it is apart from said flexible board (F);

characterized inthat

a pressure edge (96; 128; 152) is provided on said pressure member (90,
124; 147) at a such position that when said pressure member (90,

124; 147) is in said open position, it is in a first position relative to a line connecting
said turning center (87; 121; 145) of said pressure member (90, 124;

147) and said contact portions (89; 120; 140) of said contact elements (85; 115;
135) and when said pressure member (90, 124; 147) is turned to said

closed position, it is moved to a second position relative to said line such that it
presses downwardly a flexible board (F) against said contact elements
 
said contact elements (85; 115; 135) are provided with a fulcrum portion (87; 117;

137) to be fitted in said support channels (84; 114; 141) about which said pressure
