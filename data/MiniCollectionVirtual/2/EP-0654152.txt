<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a toner composition suited for 
development of electrostatic charge images. It is well known in the art of electrostatography including 
electrography and electrophotography to form an electrostatic latent 
image corresponding to either the original to be copied, or 
corresponding to digitized data describing an electronically 
available image. In electrophotography an electrostatic latent image is formed by 
the steps of uniformly charging a photoconductive member and 
imagewise discharging it by an imagewise modulated photo-exposure. In electrography an electrostatic latent image is formed by 
imagewise depositing electrically charged particles, e.g. electrons 
or ions onto a dielectric substrate. The obtained latent images are developed, i.e. converted into 
visible images by selectively depositing thereon light absorbing 
particles, called toner particles, which usually are 
triboelectrically charged. Electrostatic latent images may likewise 
be toner-developed to form a hydrophobic printing pattern on a 
hydrophilic substrate resulting thereby in a printing plate for 
lithographic printing. In toner development of latent electrostatic images two 
techniques have been applied : "dry" powder and "liquid" dispersion 
development of which dry powder development is nowadays most 
frequently used. In dry development the application of dry toner powder to the 
substrate carrying the latent electrostatic image may be carried out 
by different methods known as, "cascade", "magnetic brush", "powder 
cloud", "impression" or "transfer" development also known as 
"touchdown" development described e.g. by Thomas L. Thourson in IEEE 
Transactions on Electronic Devices, Vol. ED-19, No. 4, April 1972, 
pp.495-511. The mean diameter of dry toner particles for use in 
aerosol or powder cloud development is 1 µm, whereas the mean  
 
diameter for toner particles useful in cascade or magnetic brush 
development is about 10 µm [ref. "Principles of Non Impact Printing" 
by Jerome L. Johnson - Palatino Press Irvine CA, 92715 U.S.A. 
(1986), p. 64-85], but may be from 1 to 5 µm for high resolution 
development (ref. e.g. GB 2 180 948 A and (PCT) WO 91/00548). Dry-development toners essentially comprise a thermoplastic 
binder consisting of a thermoplastic resin or mixture of resins 
including colouring matter, e.g. carbon black or colouring material 
such as finely dispersed dye pigments or soluble dyes. The 
triboelectric chargeability of the toner particles is defined by 
said substances
