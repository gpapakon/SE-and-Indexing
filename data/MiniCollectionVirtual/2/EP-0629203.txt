<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to new chemical compounds which have value in the field
of medical science. More particularly, it relates to new chemical compounds which are
of value for administration to a mammalian subject, particularly man, as
immunosuppressive agents. These new immunosuppressive agents can be compared
to the macrolides known as FK-506 and FK-520, which are described in further detail
in United States Patent No. 4,894,366. The new compounds of this invention will find
special utility in preventing or treating graft rejection following skin and organ transplant
surgery and in preventing or treating autoimmune diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis
and psoriasis. Additionally, these macrolide derivatives will find use in preventing or
treating infectious diseases caused by fungi.Graft or organ transplant rejection following transplant surgery is a common
occurrence which arises when foreign antigens are recognized by the host's immune
response system. The host's immune response system, in an effort to "protect" itself
from the foreign tissue, then releases a cellular and humoral arsenal. Both activated
lymphocytes and antibodies attack the foreign tissue, resulting in complications which
often end in rejection of said tissue.Similarly, the occurrence of immunoregulatory irregularities in autoimmune and
chronic inflammatory diseases is well known. Irrespective of the underlying etiology of
the condition, a variety of autoantibodies and self-reactive lymphocytes often arise to
complicate the condition.Treatments which target the immune response system often result in a complete
shutdown of the system, leading to a lowering of the body's ability to combat infection.
This can be as dangerous as the original condition which led to the shutdown.Currently the leading medicinal agent for the prevention or treatment of graft
rejection is cyclosporin A, approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration
in 1983. The drug acts by inhibiting the body's immune response system from
mobilizing its arsenal of natural protecting agents to reject the transplants foreign
protein. Although cyclosporin is effective in fighting graft rejection, it suffers drawbacks
in that it can cause kidney failure, liver damage and ulcers; which in many cases can
be very severe. Safer drugs which are more selective in their ability to affect the 
immune response system and which have fewer side effects are constantly being
pursued.United States Patent No. 4,894,366 discloses the macrolides FK-506 and FK-520,
inter alia, as
