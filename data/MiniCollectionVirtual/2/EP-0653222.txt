<ABSTRACT>
A self sealing flexible elastomeric valve is disclosed. The valve can 
be used to seal a trocar device from loss of gas pressure during a 

laparoscopic surgical procedure when a surgical instrument is inserted 
therethrough as well as when no instrument is inserted. The preferred one 

piece valve includes a flange having an aperture, and a cylindrical wall 
section which extends to a pair of mutually opposed sealing wall sections 

defining a generally S-shaped slit. This slit configuration at the end of 
these wall sections define the sealing surfaces. The flange preferably 

includes a concentrically dome shaped region with the aperture centrally 
displayed. The valve also is preferably composed of a silicone rubber. 
The valve has the advantages of simplicity of manufacture and 
assembly and the ability to provide an adequate seal against the surface of 

any surgical instrument inserted through it. Also, the improved valve will 
require a small amount of force to insert instruments and will resist 

eversion of the valve walls when instruments are withdrawn. 
A trocar assembly incorporating the sealing valve as described above 
is also disclosed.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates generally to a self sealing valve which provides
and maintains a seal when an instrument or device is inserted through, or
withdrawn from, the valve. More specifically, it relates to a flexible,
elastomeric self sealing valve especially well suited for use with surgical
instruments, such as trocar assemblies necessary for numerous
laparoscopic surgical procedures.Sealing devices for trocar assemblies are an important aspect of the
design of instruments used in laparoscopic surgical procedures. A
laparoscopic surgical procedure utilizes several small puncture openings,
mainly in the abdominal wall, to allow insertion of specialized surgical
instruments instead of one large incision in a traditional open surgical
procedure. The laparoscopic procedure is becoming widely accepted
because of its many advantages such as: less trauma to the patient,
shorter recovery time, reduced adhesions, and post operative pain. The
laparoscopic surgical technique requires inflation of the abdominal cavity
to lift the abdominal wall from the internal organs to create working space
for the surgeon and to introduce light generating and optical viewing
instruments.During the laparoscopic surgical procedure, the internal gas pressure
must be maintained in order to successfully complete the procedure. In
order to maintain the internal gas pressure while instruments are passed
into and out of the openings in the abdominal cavity, sealing devices are
required for both the instruments and for the trocar assemblies used to
make and maintain the small openings. It is desirable for such sealing
devices to seal any opening within the trocar assembly when the obturator, 
which is the puncturing component of the trocar assembly, is withdrawn
after puncturing the abdominal wall. It is also desirable to seal when other
surgical instruments are inserted through the trocar cannula, which is the
hollow tube of the trocar assembly remaining in the puncture opening
throughout the remainder of the surgical procedure. Additionally, it is
desirable that the seal device produce a small amount of resistance to the
insertion force of surgical instruments passing through the trocar cannula.
Furthermore, it is desirable that the sealing device maintain gas pressure
in the abdominal cavity, despite numerous insertions and withdrawals of
surgical instruments through the trocar cannula.Current sealing devices for laparoscopic instruments are typified by
particular valve designs such as that described in U.S. Patent 5,224,952.
