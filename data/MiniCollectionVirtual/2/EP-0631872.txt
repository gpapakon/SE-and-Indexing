<ABSTRACT>
To reduce a quantity of uselessly consumed ink 
when an ink jet head (120) is recoverably activated, 

the capacity of an ink path (103, 104, 106) 
communicated with a group of ejecting ports (111) 

having a small flow rate coefficient is determined 
to be smaller than that of an ink path (103, 104, 

106) communicated with a group of ejecting ports 
(111) having a large flow rate coefficient. While 

all of plural groups of ejecting ports (111) are 
fully covered with a common recovering cap (126I, 

126II) with the aid of sucking means, ink is sucked 
from the plural groups of ejecting ports (111). 

When the ink remaining in the region extending from 
the plural groups of ejecting ports (111) to 

predetermined positions in a plurality of ink paths 
(103, 104, 106) communicated with the plural groups 

of ejecting ports (111) is discharged, ink 
discharging pos
itions are dislocated to 
predetermined positions in a plurality of ink paths 

(103, 104, 106) to positionally coincide with the 
predetermined positions in the substantially same 

timing relationship after ejection recovering 
treatment starts to be conducted.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates generally to an
ink jet head, an ink jet apparatus and a method of
recoverably activating in the apparatus.In the case that the ink jet apparatus is kept
unused for a long time or in the case that some
specific ejecting ports among a plurality of
ejecting ports is rarely used compared with other
ejecting ports, there sometimes arises a malfunction
that ink is improperly ejected from the ejecting
ports. The reason why the foregoing improper ink
ejection occurs consists in that water in ink is
evaporated from the ejection ports or water in ink
is evaporated from an ink chamber communicated with
the ejection ports. In addition, there arises
another malfunction that some ink droplets, some
water droplets or dust particles adhere to the
ejection surface of an ink jet head having a
plurality of ejecting ports formed thereon, causing
each ejected ink droplets to be pulled by the
adhered foreign materials with the result that the
ejecting direction is deviated from a predetermined
one.To prevent the foregoing malfunction from
arising, a conventional ink jet apparatus is
equipped with means as noted below to serve as a so-called 
ejection recovering system. This ejection
recovering system is exemplified by e.g.,
preliminary ejecting means for discharging ink
having an increased viscosity in a predetermined ink
receiving medium prior to each recording operation,
ink sucking means for removing some adhered
materials from ejecting ports and a common ink
chamber by sucking ink therefrom, ink sucking means
for removing air bubbles introduced in ink at the
time of ink reservoir replacement, and capping means
for preventing water in ink from being vaporized
from ejecting ports.However, the conventional ejection recovering
system has some following problems. Specifically,
the ink jet apparatus is unavoidably fabricated at
an increased cost attributable to necessity for
disposing the preliminary ejecting means, the ink
sucking means or the capping means. In addition, it
is practically difficult to design and construct the
ink jet apparatus with small dimensions because of
necessity for reserving a space required for
disposing the preliminary ejecting means, the ink
absorbing means or the capping means. Additionally,
it is necessary that an ink reservoir, a suction
pump and associated pipings are arranged for
executing preliminary ejection or ink suction, and
moreover, accumulatively store waste ink in a
certain container.With respect to an ink jet apparatus capable of
recording colored
