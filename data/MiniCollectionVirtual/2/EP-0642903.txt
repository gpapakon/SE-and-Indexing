<ABSTRACT>
A mold (100) is constructed by forming a shell (125) having a back 
surface (127) and a mold surface (126) which defines a mold cavity (150), 

by forming a shell base (124) about the back surface (127) of the shell (125) 
so as to define an enclosed cavity (134) between the shell base (124) and 

the shell (125), and by filling the enclosed cavity (134) with substantially 
incompressible material (135).

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates in general to molds, and in particular, to 
molds suitable for use in low volume applications. Prototyping is often used during product development to verify 
design concepts and to facilitate advance testing. A prototype must have 
characteristics sufficiently close to the desired product to permit a 
realistic prediction of actual product performance. Prototyping molded 
parts can be expensive both in capital outlay and in development time. 
Production quality molded parts are generally produced using metal 
mold manufacturing. A metal mold is expensive to produce and can 
require a long lead time, as time must be allocated for designing the 
mold, machining the mold cavity, texturing the surface of the mold 
cavity, and the like. When the number of design iterations is considered 
along with the relatively small prototype volumes and high cost of metal 
mold development, it is clear that metal mold manufacturing is not well-suited 
for many prototyping applications. Similarly, metal mold 
manufacturing would not be suited for short cycle time, low volume 
production runs. Alternatives more suitable for prototyping and low 
volume production have been explored. These alternatives include room 
temperature vulcanization (RTV) molds, and spray metal molds. A typical RTV design involves forming a mold from a pliable 
material, usually urethane, silicone, or similar elastomeric resin which 
can be cured at or near room temperature. First, a model of the part, 
often called a master, is formed using a stereolithography apparatus 
(SLA) process, or other suitable technique. Typically, the master is 
designed using a computer aided design (CAD) system which can 
generate data needed to construct the master. This CAD data is used by 
the SLA process which uses a laser to cure a photopolymerizable resin to 
produce a solid three-dimensional object. Although an SLA master is 
suitable for cosmetic analysis of the part, such as fit and form, and for  
 
some analysis of functionality, the SLA master may not be suitable for 
full mechanical testing. The materials currently adaptable to the SLA 
process usually have unacceptable mechanical properties for many 
applications, such as the inability to withstand high mechanical 
stresses. Next, the part is encapsulated with a material suitable for use 
in a RTV process. The material is then cured to form a RTV mold in 
which duplicates of the master are cast from a urethane, epoxy, or 
similar resin, which cross links at temperatures at or near
