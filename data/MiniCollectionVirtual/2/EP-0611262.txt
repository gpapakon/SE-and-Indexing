<ABSTRACT>
Device for automatically stretching a knitted tubular manufactured product drawn onto a support former, comprising:   - means for picking up a limited portion of the fabric of the manufactured product (4) corresponding to a side edge of the former (5), holding it and finally releasing it, with flat-ended, normally closed elastic clamp (1), - a pneumatic cylinder (2) with a horizontal axis, with the rod attached to the base of the said clamp (1) to permit its travel from and towards the former (5), - a cam (3) with rectilinear double profile for controlling the actuation, that is to say the opening and respectively the closing of the said clamp (1) in cooperation with two pivots (11), each of which is housed idly in a corresponding jaw of the clamp (1), so as to project sideways in the relation to the latter and thus to interact with a corresponding profile of the cam (3) during the travel of the clamp (1), the said cam (3) being interposed between the cylinder (2) for travel of the clamp (1) and the support former (5) of the sock (4), - an end-stop component (6) is interposed between the head of the said clamp (1) and the corresponding control cylinder (2), to limit the return operational travel of the clamp (1) and to apply in the corresponding jaws a thrust intended to generate an opening moment for the release of the sock (4).

Process for automatically extending a tubular manufactured 
knitwear product threaded on a support shape, characterized 

in that it includes the following phases in sequence: 

(a) Grasping and holding a limited lateral portion of the 
fabric of a stocking (4) threaded on the corresponding 

support shape (5), 
(b) retracting the portion of fabric held in this way in the 
transverse direction relative to the longitudinal axis (8) 

of the shape (5) for a sufficient length to permit 
elastic stretching of the stitches, 
(c) relaxing the said portion of the stocking fabric (4) 
retracted in this way to permit its elastic return on the 

support shape (5). 
Device for automatically extending a tubular manufactured 
knitwear product threaded on a support shape according to 

the process of claim 1, characterized in that it contains: 

means (1) of prehension of a limited lateral portion of the 
fabric of the manufactured product (4) corresponding to a 

lateral edge of the shape (5); 
means (2) for the movement of the said means of prehension 
(1) from and to the shape (5) of the support of the 

manufactured product (4), 
means (3) in the form of a cam with a double rectilinear 
profile with symmetrical development diverging towards the 

support shape (5) of the manufactured product (4) to 
control the actuation of the said means of prehension (1), 

which are interposed between the means (2) of moving the 
means of prehension (1) and the support shape (5) of the 

stocking (4);  
 
means (6) for limiting the operational return course of 
the means of prehension (1) of the manufactured product 

(4) and exerting a push intended to produce an opening 
moment of the pincers (1) for releasing the manufactured 

product (4). 
Device according to claim 2, characterized in that the 
said means of prehension include elastic pincers (1) 

with a flat mouth, normally closed. 
Device according to claims 2 and 3, characterized in that 
the said means for moving the pincers (1) include a 

pneumatic cylinder (2) with horizontal axis orthogonal 
to the axis (8) of the support shape (5) of the 

manufactured product (4) with the body connected to a 
fixed support part (7) and with the fixed shaft at the 

base of the pincers (1). 
Device according to claims 2 and 3, characterized in that 
each jaw of the said pincers (1) has a shaft (11) mounted 

passing through laterally and in such a way as to act 
with the corresponding profile of the cam (2) during the 

movement of the pincers (1) . 
Device according to claims 2 and 3, characterized in that 
the said means for limiting the operational return course 

of the pincers (1) include a stop part (6), which is 
interposed between the head of the pincers (1) and the 

cylinder (2). 
Device according to claim 2, characterized in that 
the said pincers (1) are fitted with an elastic strip 

(10), which is mounted longitudinally on the corresponding 
jaws.
