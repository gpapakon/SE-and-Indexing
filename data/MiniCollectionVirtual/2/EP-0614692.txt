<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a catalyst and a method for 
denitrization of nitrogen oxides contained in waste gas 
from, for example, plants or automobile engines. There are already known a variety of methods for 
denitrization of nitrogen oxides contained in waste gas, 
among which are exemplarily a method wherein nitrogen oxides 
are oxidized and absorbed in an alkali solution. A further 
method is also known wherein nitrogen oxides are reduced 
to nitrogen using a reducing agent such as ammonia, hydrogen, 
carbon monoxide or hydrocarbons in the presence of a 
catalyst. However, the former method requires treatment of the 
resultant alkaline waste water, and hence the method is 
costly, while the latter method has a disadvantage that when, 
for example, ammonia is used as a reducing agent, the ammonia 
reacts with sulfur oxides which are usually contained in the 
waste gas together with nitrogen oxides to form ammonium 
salts such as ammonium sulfate which deposits on the 
catalyst, and hence decreases denitrizing activity of the 
catalyst during the denitrizing operations. In turn, when hydrogen, carbon monoxide or hydrocarbons 
are used as a reducing gas, it predominantly reacts 
with oxygen usually present in a higher concentration than 
nitrogen oxides, so that a large amount of reducing gas 
are needed to effectively decompose the nitrogen oxides. Therefore, a numbers of catalysts have also been 
proposed which decompose directly nitrogen oxides in the 
absence of a reducing agent, however, such catalysts have  
 
hitherto been found very low in denitrizing acitivity. It is, therefore, an object of the invention to 
provide a denitrizing catalyst which selectively decomposes 
nitrogen oxides by the reaction of nitrogen oxides with a 
hydrocarbon as a reducing agent even in the presence of 
oxygen. It is a further object of the invention to provide a 
method of denitrizing nitrogen oxides in the presence of 
such a catalyst using a hydrocarbon as a reducing agent. According to the invention, there is provided a 
catalyst for denitrizing nitrogen oxides in the presence 
of a hydrocarbon as a reducing agent, which comprises: 
(A) a substituted zeolite having the general formula

M¹AM²B [(AlO₂)x(SiO₂)Y]·Z H₂O


 
in which M¹ represents an alkali metal ion or an alkaline 
earth metal ion or hydrogen ion; M² is at least one metal 
ion selected from the group consisting of Ti⁴⁺, Zr⁴⁺ and 
Sn⁴⁺; 
n₁A+n₂B=X  
 wherein n₁ is a valency of the ion M¹ 
and n₂ is a valency of the ion M²; and 
Y/X≧5  
; the M² ion
