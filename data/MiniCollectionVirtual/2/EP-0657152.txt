<ABSTRACT>
A method and apparatus for destroying residual 
lens epithelial cells within a lens capsule of an eye. 

The apparatus includes a probe configured for 
insertion into the eye such that the probe is disposed 

either in the lens capsule or between the iris and the 
lens capsule. The probe is further configured to 

deliver energy therefrom to residual lens epithelial 
cells within the lens capsule in order to destroy 

them. The method includes the steps of inserting a 
probe constructed in accordance with the apparatus of 

present invention into the eye such that a distal end 
portion of the probe is disposed either within the 

lens capsule or between the iris and the lens capsule, 
delivering energy to the probe such that residual lens 

epithelial cells within the lens capsule are 
destroyed, ceasing the delivery of energy to the 

probe, and removing the probe from the eye.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to
prevention of the occurrence of posterior capsular
opacification (PCO) or secondary cataract formation
following the extracapsular extraction of a
cataractous lens. More particularly, the present
invention is directed to the prevention of the
occurrence of PCO by destroying residual lens
epithelial cells on the interior surface of the lens
capsule of the eye through the application of energy
thereto. The present invention is
directed to a device configured to deliver energy to
residual lens epithelial cells on the lens capsule of
the eye in accordance with the method of the present
invention.Cataract extraction is among the most
commonly performed operations in the United States and
the world. The cataractous lens is located within a
capsular sac or lens capsule which is positioned
within the posterior chamber of the eye. In order to
gain access to the cataractous lens, an incision is
made at the limbus of the eye for the purpose of
introducing a surgical instrument into the anterior
chamber of the eye. In the case of extracapsular
cataract extraction, a capsularhexis procedure is
performed in which a portion of the anterior membrane
of the lens capsule adjacent to the iris is removed
using a surgical cutting instrument in order to 
provide direct access to the cataractous lens from the
anterior chamber. The lens is then removed through
various known methods, including phacoemulsification
which entails the application of ultrasonic energy to
the lens in order to break it into small pieces which
can be aspirated from the lens capsule. With the
exception of the portion of the anterior membrane of
the lens capsule that is removed in order to gain
access to the cataractous lens, the lens capsule
remains substantially intact throughout an
extracapsular cataract extraction. Following removal
of the cataractous lens, an artificial intraocular
lens typically is implanted within the lens capsule in
order to mimic the refractive function of the original
lens.Although cataractous lens removal and
intraocular lens implantation provide significant
benefits to most cataract patients, it is estimated
that up to fifty percent (50%) of all patients who
have intraocular lenses implanted within the lens
capsule will develop Posterior Capsular Opacification
("PCO") or secondary cataracts within five years after
surgery. PCO is caused by the deposit of cells and
fibers on the intraocular lens and on the posterior
capsular membrane, thereby obstructing light passing
through the intraocular
