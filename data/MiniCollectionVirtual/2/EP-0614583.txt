<ABSTRACT>
An integrated EMI/RFI filter magnetic (200) has differential and common mode inductors wound about an I-core (210). The I-core is juxtaposed with an E-core (202), with the end surfaces (222, 224, 226) of the E-core legs (204, 206, 208) facing the I-core. The magnetic has a substantially closed magnetic path of the differential inductors (300, 302) and the common mode inductors (304, 306).

<DESCRIPTION>
 INTEGRATED EMI/RFI FILTER MAGNETICSBackground of the InventionElectronic circuits produce electromagnetic interference(EMI) and radio frequency interference (RFI). The noise can interfere with the operation of televisions, radios, telephones and similar equipment. The electrical noise can conduct through the power lines or radiate through power line or through output leads.An electronic ballast or any other electronic circuit for powering fluorescent lights is affected by EMI/RFI noise and also produce EMI/RFI noise. A filter is therefore needed to reduce the EMI/RFI noise produced by the ballasts and to filter the EMI/RFI noise from the lines powering the ballasts.Additionally, a filter for an electronic ballast should filter any power line transients, as well as decrease THD (total harmonic distortion).There are two types of EMI/RFI noise. Differential noise is interference generated between the power line and the return line. Common mode noise is interference between both the power line and the return line and ground.In some electronic ballasts, an inductor is placed in series in the power line to eliminate differential noise. Elimination of common mode noise is done by way of two inductors wound on the same core. One of the two inductors is in series with the power line and the second inductor in series with the return line.Use of one component for the differential inductor and another component for the common mode inductor increases the cost of the ballast. The cost is high. There is difficulty in manufacturing the magnetics as well as assembly of the magnetics into the circuit board. Additional space is required on the board. 

 Summary of the InventionA magnetic for an EMI/RFI filter comprises a common mode inductor wound around a core, the inductor having a substantially closed magnetic path for the common mode inductor. A differential inductor is wound around the core and the inductor having a substantially closed magnetic path for the differential mode inductor. A method of constructing the magnetic for an EMI/RFI filter uses the steps of providing an E-core with a first outer leg, a center leg, and a second outer leg, each leg having an end surface, placing a second core proximal to and spaced from the end surfaces of the E-core legs, placing a first winding about the first outer leg of the E-core, the first winding having a first number of turns, placing a second winding about the second outer leg of the E-core, the second winding having a second number of turns.
