<ABSTRACT>
Aqueous wood treating compositions, containing 
compounds which contain elements selected from copper, 

chromium and arsenic and oxyalkylene polymer 
additives, provide improved stability to CCA solutions 

containing additives. In addition, the compositions 
of the present invention have been found to retard 

hardening effects associated with wood treated with 
commercial CCA solutions.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to compositions useful for preserving
timber products. The timber products to which the present invention
is directed are typically foundation piles, utility poles, posts, fences,
decks, railroad ties, marina structures and other types of products
subject to decay due to insect pests, fungi and weathering. The
compositions of the invention provide improved chromated copper arsenate (CCA) wood treating solutions
having enhanced stability when compared to conventional CCA type
solutions. In addition, these compositions, when used to preserve wood
products, retard the hardness usually associated with CCA type
solutions, resulting in less cracking and improved climbability.The two main types of preservatives used to treat timber
products include oil-based preservatives such as coal tar creosote,
solutions of creosote with coal tar or petroleum oils, and solutions of
preservative chemicals, such as pentachlorophenol dissolved in a
suitable organic carrier; and water-based preservatives such as acid
copper chromate solution (ACC), chromated copper arsenate solution
(CCA) and ammoniacal copper arsenate solution (ACA). CCA solutions
are preferred since they chemically react in the wood to form
compounds which are toxic to both fungi and insects. However, CCA solutions have been known to impart undesirable
characteristics to treated wood such as hardening due to chemical
fixation of Cr (VI) in the wood, and various attempts have been made
to improve CCA type wood treating solutions to increase softness of the
treated wood. In addition, the use of reducing agents or other
additives in CCA solutions tends to raise the pH of the solution above
about 2, causing premature precipitation of chromated copper arsenate
from wood treating solutions prior to or during use, resulting in
unacceptable treated products and significant costs associated with
waste disposal or replacement of the solutions.US-A-4,567,115 describes a method of treating wood,
comprising the step of exposing wood to an aqueous solution consisting
essentially of water, hexavalent chromium, copper, arsenic and
polyethylene glycol. In a particular embodiment, a 10% concentration
of 1000 molecular weight polymer of ethylene glycol (PEG 1000) is
added to the standard diluted CCA solution in a manner so that a
stable solution is obtained. The useful range of PEG solutions is
described as being in the 500 to 2000 molecular weight range.US-A-4,847,002, issued to the same inventor of the
above patent, describes another attempt at
