<ABSTRACT>
A charging circuit charges a nickel-cadmium battery 
by means of a constant current source. A resistor, diodes 

and a tantalum capacitor are connected between an output 
terminal of the charging circuit and a ground potential. 

A junction between the capacitor and the diode is connected 
to one input terminal and an output terminal of a comparator 

and to the output terminal of the charging circuit. The 
other input terminal of the comparator is supplied with 

a reference potential. An output signal having a period 
which depends on a voltage of the battery is generated at 

the output terminal. The diodes compensate for a variation 
of the period of the output signal caused by temperature 

dependent capacitance change of the capacitor.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a charging circuit 
for a rechargeable battery and, particularly, to a battery 
charging circuit capable of measuring voltage of a battery 
such as nickel-cadmium battery regardless of temperature 
condition in a place where the battery is located. The rechargeable battery such as nickel-cadmium 
battery has been widely used with recent popularization 
of portable personal computer and telephone, etc., and 
thus a charging circuit capable of exactly charging such 
a battery to a predetermined voltage level has been also 
popularized. A conventional charging circuit includes a measuring 
circuit for equivalently measuring a charged voltage level 
of the battery by converting a battery voltage into a signal 
having a periodical waveform. The circuit for converting 
voltage into periodic waveform has, however, a problem that 
it can not measure an exact charge voltage in a location 
where temperature is changed largely within a short time, 
for reasons to be described later. In the specification of European patent application 
number 87115636.0, which was published under number 
265879 on May 4 1988, there was proposed a battery 
charger having a microprocessor which cuts off the supply 
of a high charge current when the voltage of a battery 
drops below a peak value by a value greater than a 
threshold value corresponding to stored digital data. 
The microprocessor is also used to control discharge and 
autocycle modes of operation, analog to digital 
conversions and in computing energy capacity and 
efficiency. A feature of a charging circuit to be described 
below is that it has a battery voltage monitoring circuit  
 
capable of precisely measuring a battery voltage even if 
the temperature thereof is changed within a short time. A charging circuit to be described below as an 
example has a constant current source for charging a battery 
and a comparator having a pair of input terminals and an 
output terminal connected to one of the input terminals. 
The other input terminal of the comparator is supplied 
with a reference voltage and an output signal whose 
periodicity depends upon a voltage of the battery is 
provided at the output terminal. A tantalum capacitor is 
connected between the one input terminal of the comparator 
and a ground potential. A resistor is inserted between 
an output terminal of the constant current source and 
the one input terminla of the comparator. A temperature 
compensating element is provided between the output terminal 
of the constant
