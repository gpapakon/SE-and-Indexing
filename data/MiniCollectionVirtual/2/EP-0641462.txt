<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates generally to color 
electrostatic imaging and particularly to apparatus for 
developing color electrostatic images. Systems for color liquid toner electrostatic image 
reproduction are known in the art. Such an apparatus is, for example, disclosed in US-A-3 276 896. These systems comprise 
apparatus for creating a latent electrostatic image on a 
surface through the formation of image and background areas, 
apparatus for developing the latent image including 
contacting the latent image with a liquid toner and a 
background cleanup apparatus that minimizes the undesirable 
deposition of toner on background surfaces. The development 
systems described in PCT patent application WO 90/14619 
employ a reverse roller as a development surface with the 
reverse roller voltage intermediate the voltages on the 
image and background regions of the latent image bearing 
surface. For the systems described therein the background 
downstream of the development roller is virtually free of 
carrier liquid. Other systems which do not use rollers as a 
development surface, such as those described in U.S. Patent 
4,420,244, use a reverse roller charged to a voltage 
intermediate the voltage on image and background areas of 
the surface for removal of toner particles and excess liquid 
from the background and for the metering of the image. There is provided in accordance with the present 
invention imaging apparatus having an image forming surface 
arranged for movement in a first direction and an image 
forming apparatus for forming electrostatic latent image and 
background areas at respective first and second electrical 
potentials on the image forming surface, development 
apparatus for developing the electrostatic latent image 
using a liquid developer including electrically charged 
toner particles to form a developed image, the development 
apparatus comprising a development surface maintained in a 
spaced apart relationship from the image forming surface and 
moving in a direction opposite to the first direction, an  
 
additional surface spaced from the image forming surface for 
the removal of toner particles from the background areas and 
preferably moving in a direction opposite to the first 
direction, and apparatus for supplying a liquid to at least 
a portion of the space between the image forming surface and 
the additional surface. Alternatively, in a preferred embodiment of the 
invention, the additional surface moves in the first 
direction. In accordance with a preferred
