<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a triple pressure valve for a control installation of a compressed air brake, with a first diaphragm (2) which, in a casing (1), separates a venting chamber (5) connected to atmosphere from a pressure chamber (6) which can be subjected to brake-cylinder pressure, with a second diaphragm (3), which is coupled to the first diaphragm (2) by a rod (17) and, in a casing (1), separates a control-pressure chamber (8) from a backpressure chamber (9), and with a double-seat valve (37, 38, 39), actuable by the rod (17), for controlling the venting or filling of a brake cylinder (12) from a reservoir (10). To ensure rapid initial filling of the brake cylinder with compressed air, the double-seat valve (37, 38, 39) is, according to the invention, arranged in a brake-pressure chamber (13) - formed in the casing (1) between the two diaphragms (2, 3) - which is connected via a restrictor (14) to the pressure chamber (6) and supplies the latter with the brake-cylinder pressure in a delayed manner. The rod (17) is furthermore coupled to the first diaphragm (2) via an elastic element (19).
