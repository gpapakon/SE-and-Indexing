<ABSTRACT>
A thermal shield and support structure assembly for a gas 
turbine 

engine is disclosed wherein the thermal shield can be removed while 
the 

support structure (24) is still mounted in the engine. The thermal 
shield in the form 

of a divergent seal baseplate (26) and the support structure is 
particularly useful for 

divergent seals and provides a removable baseplate having at least 
two hooks (40) 

disposed on the back side of the baseplate. The hooks have axially 
facing 

openings, preferably open in the forward facing direction and are 
operable to 

engage transversely extending pins (52) on the frame of the support 
structure. An 

axial retaining means to prevent the hooks from disengaging from the 
pins may 

also be used which, in one embodiment, provides a lug (60) having a first 
aperture (62) 

and extending away from the back side of the baseplate to engage 
a clevis (64) 

having two arms having second apertures alignable with the lug's 
aperture and 

a bolt (70) or other fastening means disposed through the apertures.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to aircraft gas turbine engine nozzles and in
particular to removable baseplates for the divergent seals in the nozzles.A gas turbine engine produces a reaction thrust by ejecting a high
velocity stream of gas from an exhaust nozzle. Air enters the engine and is
compressed in a compressor section, fuel is added to the compressed air and at
least a part of it is combusted in a combustor section, and the hot gas is then
expanded in a turbine section. Part of the produced energy is extracted to
drive the compressor section. Often, particularly in the case of military
engines, the turbine effluent is mixed with additional fuel and combusted a
second time in an afterburner before being expanded through an exhaust nozzle
which converts the remaining available energy of the gas stream into a high
velocity flow producing thrust for propulsion power. Thrust developed by the
engine can range from a few hundred pounds to many thousand pounds.A typical aircraft gas turbine engine uses a high pressure converging-diverging
exhaust nozzle having alternating convergent nozzle flaps and seals
mounted circumferentially around the exhaust section. This convergent section
of nozzle is typically capable of adjustably reducing the cross-sectional area
through which exhaust gas flows, forming a variable area nozzle throat at its
aft end. Mounted immediately aft of the converging nozzle flaps in a similar
manner and hinged thereto are corresponding divergent nozzle flaps and seals. 
One particular application for the present invention is an advanced
axisymmetric vectoring nozzle (AVENâ„¢ nozzle) wherein the convergent and
divergent flaps are connected by a universal joint such as a ball joint to vector
the nozzle's exhaust flow and thrust. Further reference may be had to U.S.
Patent No. 4,994,660, entitled "AXISYMMETRICAL VECTORING
EXHAUST NOZZLE", by Hauer, assigned to the present assignee.These divergent flaps increase the exit area through which the exhaust
gases flow. At idle and cruise speeds, the nozzle configuration is set to
maximize fuel efficiency. However, for take-off and acceleration during flight
when maximum thrust is needed, the nozzle is adjusted accordingly to provide
the converging-diverging gas flow passage. The dimensions of the throat and
exit flow passage areas are varied to match the flow and expansion
requirements of varying flight speeds and altitudes experienced on a routine
basis by the aircraft.The flaps and seals are generally rectangular in shape and are about
three to six
