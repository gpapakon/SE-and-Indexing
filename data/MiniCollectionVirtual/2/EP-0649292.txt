<DESCRIPTION>
This application is a continuation-in-part of U.S.
Patent application Serial No. 07/911,489, filed July
10, 1992 entitled "Removable Brush-Head for Ultrasonic
Toothbrush; and U.S. Patent No. 5,138,733, which issued
May 18, 1992 from U.S. Patent application Serial No.
07/674,123, filed March 25, 1991 entitled "Ultrasonic
Toothbrush".This invention relates to toothbrushes. More
particularly the invention is concerned with an
apparatus facilitating the use of ultrasonic energy to
assist an otherwise manual toothbrush in loosening and
removing soft plague from the teeth of the user on a
substantially daily basis. A specific concern of the
invention is an apparatus that carries the bristle
clusters, which is readily replaceable as wear of the
bristles occur. Another concern is the therapeutic
treatment of oral tissue, and specifically treatment
and prevention of mouth sores.Numerous attempts have been made to develop an
apparatus to remove plague or tartar from the surface
of the teeth. Some of the devices utilized sonic
and/or ultrasonic energy. The devices utilizing sonic
or ultrasonic energy can be grouped into three distinct
categories.One approach is the utilization of only fluids as
a medium of energy transmission and plague removal by
placing an ultrasonic transducer into the middle of the
mouth. This approach is impractical and
physiologically dangerous due to the high energy levels
it requires to be effective in absence of any 
mechanical scrubbing, and the uncontrolled, variable,
user dependent distance between the transducer and the
teeth. A typical example is U.S. Patent 3,760,799.The second approach is the application of
ultrasonic energy to vibrate the toothbrush. While
these teachings are aged, no application to date has
demonstrated the practical feasibility of carrying out
the science in this manner. The significant drawback
of some of these proposals is that the toothbrush or
applicator is solidly attached, otherwise fixed to the
transducer, making replacement of the brush difficult
and expensive, taking the device out of the
economically affordable daily dental hygiene device
category for the general population. Examples of these
devices can be found in the following U.S. Patents:
4,192,035, 4,333,197 and 4,787,847.The third and only theory reduced to practice to
date is to remove hardened or calcified plaque colonies
from the surface of the teeth on infrequent periodical
basis. This art has been made available to
professional dentists in the form of a high energy
device that couples the

<CLAIMS>
A therapeutic dental hygiene device (20) for use with
a dentifrice, the device comprising:


a rigid elongated member (22) of non-conductive
material having a handle end and a bristle end; a piezoelectric

transducer (28);
means (26) coupled to the piezoelectric transducer
operative for generating sonic frequency electrical

signals and transmitting said signals to said piezoelectric
transducer (28);
a plurality of bristle clusters (34) for carrying
dentifrice; and
means (32) removably supporting the bristle clusters (34) on the
bristle end of the elongated member (22), characterised in that said 
piezoelectric transducer (28) is secured to the
elongated member (22) adjacent the bristle end for

contracting and expanding volumetrically in response to a
changing electrical field generating vibrations of

sonic frequency operative to cause mild cavitation in
the dentifrice to loosen soft plaque on the surface of the

teeth without appreciable relative movement of the bristle
end with respect to the handle end, and to transmit

sonic vibrations to adjacent tissue; and in that said
means (32) removably supporting the bristle clusters
(34) on the bristle end of the elongated member (22) are

removably secured to the elongated member adjacent
the piezsoelectric transducer (28), said bristle clusters

(34) to be received within the human mouth for conducting
said vibrations to the dentifrice and moved across tooth

and gingival surfaces for dislodging the loosened soft
plaque therefrom, and said means for supporting the bristle

clusters having external surfaces adjacent said bristle
clusters for contacting mouth tissue inside the oral cavity

for reducing the recurrence and severity of mouth sores.
A device (20) according to claim 1, wherein the
bristle support means comprises:


a substantially tubular body containing a tapered
cavity being smaller than a mating part on said rigid 

elongate member (22), and forced to fit, in use, onto the
rigid elongate member mating part;
flexible walls with means securing said bristle
clusters (32) within one of said flexible walls and having

at least one inner surface portion in the cavity for
forcibly engaging, in use, a corresponding surface of the

mating part when fit thereon, other said flexible walls
including tensioning means to forcibly pull said flexible

wall containing said bristle clusters into intimate contact
against said dental hygiene device to conduct vibrations to

sonic frequency from said rigid elongate member to the
surface within said tubular body and to said bristle

clusters, wherein the flexible wall opposite to the said
flexible wall containing said bristle clusters includes a

slot (76) to allow the tensions generated by the expanding side
walls to pull the flexible end portion of said flexible

wall into a groove (42) in the rigid elongate member retain said
bristle support means thereon against the forces generated

by the friction between said bristle clusters and the teeth
of the user, the bristle support means being removable by

an application of an axial force.
The brush device (20) of claim 2 wherein the one or
more flexible walls is constructed to form a gap (47) between

the bristle support member (32) and the rigid support
member (22), the said gap being substantially perpendicular

to the longitudinal axis of the bristle support member to
receive means to disengage the bristle support member from

the rigid member.
The device of claim 2, wherein the at least one inner
surface portion in the cavity comprises a planar surface (78)

slanted relative to a longitudinal axis of the mating part,
said cavity having a relatively narrow inner portion and a

relatively wide open end. 
The device of claim 4, wherein the slanted surface
acts as an inclined plane opposite a corresponding surface

on the mating part.
The device of any of claims 1 to 5, wherein the dental
hygiene device is an ultrasonic or a subsonic device.
The device of any of claims 1 to 5, wherein the dental
hygiene device operates in the audible sound frequency

range.
The device of any preceding claim, wherein the bristle
clusters extend laterally from the bristle support opposite

the piezsoelectric transducer to space said transducer from
the teeth.
