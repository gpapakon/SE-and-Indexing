<ABSTRACT>
A disposable absorbent pad comprises a pad member (1) 
adapted to present a boat-shape under the contractile force 

of elastic members (9,10) contained in side flaps (7), and an 
elastic support member (2). Longitudinally opposite ends of 

the pad member (1) are connected to front and rear sides of 
the s
upport member (2) by end flaps (6) each comprising top- 
and backsheets (3,4) of the pad member (1) and divided into 

a pair of end flap halves by a slit (8) so as to function as 
a suspending strap. The end flap halves are set apart in a V-shape 

with the slit (8) therebetween as the support member (2) 
is stretched and contribute to suspend the pad member (1) with 

high stability.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to so-called disposable
absorbent pads, particularly such as incontinence pads or
sanitary or menstruation pads, adapted to be used only once
and then thrown away.So far as it is known to the inventors, there are several
articles of prior art used as incontinence guards which are
partially similar in their constructions to the disposable
absorbent pad of the present invention. For example, the
specification of U.S. Patent No. 3,452,753 discloses an
article comprising a water-impermeable outer cover (not
disposable) designed for elastic fitting around the wearer's
waist- and leg-holes and a support attached to the inner side
of the cover for a separate absorbent pad and Japanese Laid-Open
Patent Application No. 1982-143502 discloses an article
comprising an elastically stretchable waist band and straps
interconnected to each other so as to form a supporter (not
disposable) functioning to support a separate absorbent pad,
wherein the supporter surrounds the wearer's legs not
completely but partially.These well known techniques are similar to
embodiments of the invention in that they are provided with
straps connected to the elastically stretchable waist band to
support the absorbent pad in direct or indirect manner and the
basic body or supporter is configured so as to surround the
wearer's legs not completely but partially.There are many other incontinence guard articles of prior
art, particularly of disposable type, for example, a
disposable incontinence guard article comprising a liquid-permeable
topsheet, a liquid-impermeable backsheet, a liquid-absorbent
core sandwiched between these two sheets, and
elastically stretchable members arranged along waist- and leg-holes
and such an article further comprising a separate
absorbent pad to be attached to the inner side of the article. The straps employed by the prior art disclosed in US
Patent No. 3,452,753 appear to be provided for the purpose
of assuring a stability with which a pad member of the
article can be put on the wearer's body and the straps
employed by the prior art disclosed in Japanese Laid-Open
Patent Application No. 1982-143502 function only as
components of the supporter.According to the arrangement disclosed in the
specification of U.S. Patent No. 3,452,753, much time and
labor would be required to make the article since the straps
comprise a combination of the basic component of the article
and separate components. According to the arrangement
disclosed in Japanese Laid-Open Patent Application No.

<CLAIMS>
A disposable absorbent pad comprising:

a pad member (1) for being placed at least in the
wearer's crotch, said pad member (1) comprising a liquid-permeable

topsheet (3), a liquid-impermeable backsheet (4)
and a liquid-absorbent core (5) sandwiched between said topsheet

(3) and said backsheet (4);
said topsheet (3) and said backsheet (4) extending
outwardly beyond longitudinally opposite ends of said core

(5) to form end flaps (6) beyond transversely opposite side
edges of said core (5) to form side flaps (7), said side

flaps (7) being provided with longitudinally stretchable
elastic members (9,10) attached in their stretched state to

said side flaps (7), a portion of each of said side flaps
(7) being partially folded inwards with said elastic

members (9,10) being held in their stretched state and
bonded together at longitudinally opposite ends of these

folded portions; and a support member (2) for being placed
at least around the wearer's waist and connected to the

longitudinally opposite ends of said end flaps (6);

   characterised in that the support member (2) is
elastically stretchable; said end flaps (6) are formed with

slits (8) substantially bisecting them and extending to the
longitudinally opposite ends thereof; and adjacent end flap

sections formed by the slits (8) are disposed immediately
adjacent one another when the support member (2) is in the

unstretched state and are spread apart from one another to
form a "V" when the support member (2) is in the stretched

state.
A disposable absorbent pad according to claim 1,
wherein said portions of the side flaps (7) folded inwards

are further partially folded outwards.
A disposable absorbent pad according to claim 1 or 2,
wherein said top- and backsheets (3,4) are made of material 

having a stretchability at least longitudinally of said pad
member (1) and thereby said end flaps (6) are provided with

a longitudinal stretchability.
A disposable absorbent pad according to claim 1, 2 or
3, wherein said elastic members (9,10) are arranged so as to

extend further into said end flaps (6) and thereby said end
flaps (6) also are provided with a longitudinal

stretchability.
A disposable absorbent pad according to any preceding
claim, wherein said elastic member (9) extending adjacent

the outermost edge of said inwardly folded portion of each
side flap (7) has a stretching stress higher than that of

said other elastic member (10).
A disposable absorbent pad according to any preceding
claim, wherein said support member (2) comprises an elastic

waist band.
A disposable absorbent pad according to any one of
claims 1 to 5, wherein said support member (2) comprises

short pants (101) with an elastic waist band.
A disposable absorbent pad according to any one of
claims 1 to 5, wherein said support member (2) comprises a

single band having longitudinally opposite ends and at least
one of these ends is provided with fastener means (13a,13b)

by which the other end is detachably fastened to said one
end.
A disposable absorbent pad according to any one of
claims 1 to 5, wherein said support member (2) comprises a

waist band closed in endless fashion.
