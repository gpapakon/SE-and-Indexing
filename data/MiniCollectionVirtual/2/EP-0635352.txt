<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method of controlling a blow molding machine
from a completion of production of one product to a start of production of a next
product and a blow molding machine having means for controlling the blow
molding machine between a completion of production of one product and a start of
production of the next product.The blow molding machine is a machine which
serves to make resin hollow moldings in accordance
with the shape of a cavity formed in a mold held by a
mold clamping unit. Upon molding operation, parisons
as supplied from an extruder are received in the mold,
and subjected to an air blow out of a calibrating
unit.Due to a diversity of resin hollow moldings, it
is necessary to prepare molds as well as molding jigs
such as a blow pin, die and core which are adapted
thereto.An installation of a plurality of blow molding
machines to correspond to different types of resin
hollow moldings is uneconomical, so that a single blow
molding machine is generally used wherein different
types of resin hollow moldings are formed by changing
the molds and the molding jigs.Conventionally, an exchange of the molds and the
molding jigs are carried out manually, and not
automatically. This does not allow a continuous
operation of the blow molding machine.With such a manual exchange, however, the
operator can drop the mold having a heavy weight even
when using a lifter, a roller, etc., resulting in a
possible injury.Further, when mounting and detaching the die and
core, a scrubbing of the resin is also needed, which
may cause a burn to the operator.Furthermore, an exchange of the blow pin 
accompanies a centering operation thereof in addition
to a mounting and detaching of water and air pipes,
which needs hands and times.The blow molding machine can continuously be
operated by automatic control from a start of
production of one product to a completion of
production thereof, however, it cannot automatically
carry out a preparation from a completion of
production of one product to a start of production of
a next product.One solution of the problem to an automatic
preparation from a completion of production of one
product to a start of production of a next product is
the use of a so-called robot, which is, however,
unsuitable for the blow molding machine due to high
cost and need of a space.From the trade journal Plasterverarbeiter, volume 38, no. 4, April 1987, page 21 to
