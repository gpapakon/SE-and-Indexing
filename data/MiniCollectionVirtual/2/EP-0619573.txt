<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an electronic music-performing apparatus such as
an electronic musical instrument, an electronic piano player, an electronic musical
multimedia system or the like, and more particularly to an electronic music-performing
apparatus of the type which includes a performance information
analyzer for analyzing a performance information including a plurality of tone pitch
information of a musical tune into a plurality of performance parts prior to chord
detection.In recent years, there has been proposed an electronic musical instrument for
harmonizing automatic accompaniment with performance played on a keyboard. In
this kind of electronic musical instruments, it is required to detect a chord for
determining a tone pitch of the accompaniment tone. For this reason, the chord is
determined on a basis of a performance information applied from the keyboard or
key-codes of depressed keys of the keyboard. A prior art chord detection device,
namely an automatic key split in a single stage keyboard is for instance disclosed in
JP 62-42517. When a plurality of keys are concurrently depressed and among them
a predetermined number or more of keys are positioned within a certain limited
span, namely, when the keys which are close to each other in pitch are depressed,
the entire keyboard is divided into a chord region and a non-chord region (usually,
left and right) demarcated at a certain split point (or points) automatically
determined so that the chord region should include such close keys and the non-chord
region should be outside the chord region. Based on the keys depressed in the 
chord region, a chord is detected, while the keys, if any, depressed outside the chord
region cause the generation of the notes individually corresponding thereto.A similar device for chord detection is known from JP 62-19898. It relates to an
automatic bass and chord recognition system in a single stage keyboard. When a
plurality of keys are concurrently depressed, a bass note and a chord are detected
from those depressed keys according to a predetermined rule which depends on the
number of keys depressed. Where three keys are depressed concurrently, a bass note
is determined by the lowest key among the three and a chord is detected by all the
three keys. Where four or more keys are depressed concurrently, a bass note is
determined by the lowest key and a chord is detected by the lowest three keys except
the lowest key (i.e. the second lowest, the third lowest and the fourth lowest keys
among the four or
