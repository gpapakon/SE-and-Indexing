<ABSTRACT>
Improved process for the treatment of product resulting from catalytic reforming with improved production of hydrogen. It includes a separation, an absorption at 20-60 DEG C and at a pressure of at least 10 bars, a purification of hydrogen on adsorbent beds and a recycling of the residual gas obtained at the purification step. The invention makes it possible to eliminate refrigeration devices and to improve the production of hydrogen by nearly 15 %.

A method of processing the product emanating from a
catalytic reforming reaction of a hydrocarbonated

feedstock comprising :

separation of the product (P) of reforming into a
hydrogen rich gaseous phase (R) and an effluent (E),
recycling of a part of gaseous phase (R) obtained at
separation and passing it to the reforming reaction,
a compression of the other part of the said gaseous
phase (R) to a pressure of at least 10 bars,
recontacting of the said effluent (E) with the
compressed gaseous phase (R) under conditions which

make it possible to obtain a gas (G) which is enriched
in hydrogen and a liquid phase which is enriched in

reformate,
a purification of the said gas (G) in order to obtain
hydrogen of better that 99 % purity and a residual gas

(GR),

the said method being characterised in that the residual
gas (GR) is in part at least recycled in the gaseous

phase which is subjected to compression, recycling being
carried out at a substantially constant pressure, the

other part of the residual gas which is not recycled
being rejected.
A method according to claim 1 characterised in that the
effluent (E) and the compressed gaseous phase are

recontacted at a pressure comprised between 10 and 50
bars, and a temperature comprised between 20 and 60Â°C, in

order to obtain a gas (G) with a hydrogen purity at
least equal to 95%.
A plant for processing the product emanating from the
reactor for reforming hydrocarbonated feedstock,

comprising : 

a separator (1) provided with an inlet duct (20) for
product emanating from the reforming reactor, a duct

(21) for drawing off a hydrogen rich gaseous phase (R)
and a duct (22) for discharging an effluent (E),
a duct (23) connected to the duct for drawing off the
hydrogen rich gaseous phase (R) from the separator and

terminating at a duct for supplying the reforming
reactor, for recycling a part of the said gaseous

phase (R) coming from the separator,
a compression loop comprising at least one compressor
(3) and its utilities disposed on the duct for drawing

off the hydrogen rich phase (R) in order to compress

to at least 10 bars the gaseous phase emanating from
the separator and which is not recycled,
a duct (26) for feeding the said compressed phase into
the duct carrying the effluent (E) to the recontactor,
a recontactor (4) provided with a duct for the intake
of effluent mixed with the pressurised gaseous phase,

a duct (27) for drawing off the reformate and a duct
(28) for drawing off the gas,
a purification unit (5) into which the said gas enters
and from which emerges through the duct (32) the

hydrogen which has a purity greater than 99% and a
residual gas,
a duct (31) for recycling the said residual gas,
connecting the purification unit (5) to the duct (24)

supplying the compression loop, 
an intermediate container (6) situated in the
purification unit (5) or on the duct through which the

residual gas emerges from the said unit.
