<CLAIMS>
A process for the production of cold, comprising at least one stage of
adsorption of carbon dioxide by an ads
orbent solid substance and at least one
stage of desorption of the carbon dioxide adsorbed in said adsorbent substance,

in which process said adsorbent substance comprises activated carbon fibers or
an active charcoal and has a specific surface of at least 700 m
2
/g and an external
specific surface of at least 0.005 m
2
/g.
The process as claimed in claim 1, wherein the activated carbon fibers
have a specific surface of at least 1000 m
2
/g and an external specific surface of
at least 0.2 m
2
/g.
A device for the production of cold by adsorption/desorption of carbon
dioxide, comprising at least one vessel packed with an adsorbent solid substance,

in which device said adsorbent substance comprises activated carbon fibers or
active charcoal and has a specific surface of at least 700 m
2
/g and an external
specific surface of at least 0.005 m
2
/g.
The device as claimed in claim 3, wherein the activated carbon fibers
have a specific surface of at least 1000 m
2
/g and an external specific surface of
at least 0.2 m
2
/g.
The device as claimed in claim 3, which is of the resorption type and
comprises at least two interconnectable vessels (10, 11) packed with different

adsorbent solid substances, one of these adsorbent substances being activated
carbon fibers or an active charcoal and having a specific surface of at least 700

m
2
/g and an external specific surface of at least 0.005 m
2
/g, and being subjected,
on a Clapeyron diagram, to an adsorption/desorption cycle situated on the lefthand

side of the temperature well employed, and the other adsorbent substance
being chosen so that its adsorption/desorption cycle is situated on the right-hand

side of said well.
The device as claimed in claim 5, wherein the other adsorbent
substance is a zeolite.
