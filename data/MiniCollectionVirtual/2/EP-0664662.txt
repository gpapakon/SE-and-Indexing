<ABSTRACT>
A sheathed heater comprising at least two core 
pieces (2a, 2b) of porcelain insulator separated to 

each other in the axial direction of said core 
piece (2a, 2b), at least two lead pins (3a, 3b) 

separated to each other and inserted into the core 
pieces (2a, 2b) axially, at least two internal 

heater coil segments (4a, 4b) wound around the 
at leaat two core pieces (2a, 2b), respectively, 

and a cylindrical metal sheath (1) into which the 
core pieces (2a, 2b) and the internal heater coil 

segments (4a, 4b) are inserted through a thermal and 
electrical insulation material (5), wherein adjacent 

ends of adjacent internal heater coil segments (4a, 
4b) are electrically connected to the same lead pin, 

or lead pins (3a, 3b) of the same electric potential.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a sheathed heater,
and more particularly to an improvement of a
sheathed heater for use at a higher temperature atmosphere and starts
from the prior art mentioned in the description as 'conventional
sheathed heaters' according to Figure 2 resp. to Figure 3.The conventional sheathed heater to be connected
across a single-phase power source, as shown in
Fig. 1, comprises a metal pipe 1, such as a stainless
steel pipe, a core of porcelain insulator 2 made
of magnesia or the like and arranged at the center
of the metal pipe 1, a pair of lead pins 3a, 3b
having base portions which are inserted into small 1
holes formed in and passing through said core of
porcelain insulator 2, an internal heater coil 4
wound around said core of porcelain insulator 2
and a thermal and electrical insulation material
5 of magnesia or the like filled in a space formed
between the metal pipe 1 and the core of porcelain
insulator 2, both ends of said internal heater coil
4 being electrically connected to said pair of lead
pins 3a, 3b, respectively. Such a sheathed heater is
reduced in diameter by a subsequent swaging process. In such a conventional sheathed heater, however,
if the lengtn thereof is too long the sheathed
heater tends to bend when it is subjected to said
swaging process. Accordingly, it was contemplated
to divide axially the core of porcelain insulator 2
into two or more core pieces, for example, into
three core pieces 2a∼2c, and a planar spacer 6 of
magnesia or the like is inserted between adjacent
core pieces, as shown in Fig. 2.Further, in the conventional sheathed heater,
the heater coil 4 has a limitation in length due
to the diameter of the heater coil wire and the
value of voltage applied thereto. Accordingly, said
heater coil 4 is also divided into three heater coil
segments 4a ∼ 4c, each wound around a different core piece
2a∼ 2c, and the voltage of a single-phase power source is applied
by lead pins 3a, 3b to both ends of each heater coil segment 4a, 4b or
4c. Specifically, as shown in Fig. 2, one end A1,
A2 or A3 of the heater coil segment 4a, 4b or 4c
is connected to one of said lead pins 3a, 3b at one
end of each of the core pieces 2a, 2b or 2c, and the other
end B1, B2 or B3 of each heater coil segment 4a,
4b or 4c is connected to the other of said lead
pins 3a, 3b at the other end of each of the core pieces 
2a, 2b or 2c.Fig. 3 shows a conventional sheathed heater to be connected across
a three-phase power source.It is publicly known that in the sheathed heater the insulation
