<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to metal-shielded signal cables in which 
one or more electric signal conductors or optical fiber cables are 
surrounded as a unit by extruded or tape-wrapped insulation, a 
metal shielding, and an optional outer protective polymer jacket. In the field of coaxial electric signal cables there is 
voluminous prior art on variations of construction and composition 
of the center signal conductor, the insulation, also called the 
dielectric, the coaxial shielding, and the optional protective 
outer jacket of the cables. Continuing efforts are made to provide a cable having the best 
electrical characteristics, the lightest weight, the greatest 
flexibility, and the smallest size possible. These qualities along 
with the best economy of manufacture are needed considering the 
necessary qualities the cable must have to be useful to meet the 
increasingly high specifications necessary for application in 
modern electronic apparatus, such as computers, communications 
satellites, inhabited space modules and space craft, and ground 
communications equipment. Much improvement in cable properties has been accomplished in 
recent years by utilization of foamed insulation, such as foamed 
thermoplastic polymers and especially porous expanded 
polytetrafluoroethylene (ePTFE), such as that disclosed in U.S. 
Patents 3,953,566, 3,962,153, 4,096,227, 4,187,390, 4,902,423, and 
4,478,665 (assigned to W. L. Gore & Associates, Inc.), for example. 
To achieve an insulation having the lowest dielectric constant, 
less of these materials are required for a given dielectric 
constant.  
 Thin copper or aluminum wire tubing has been extruded around 
center conductors and insulation to provide shielding of the cable 
against outside electromagnetic field (EM) interference. Spirally 
wrapped metal foil and served or braided metal wires or tape also 
serve this purpose as does metal-plated (metallized) polymer tape 
wrapped spirally or cigarette wrapped around the insulation. If 
protection of the cable against electromagnetic interference (EMI) 
or electromagnetic radiation is desired, a conductive metal may be 
used in the shielding. It has also become useful to bundle more than one of the 
cables described above together in a single cable and to include 
one or more optical fiber signal cables in the bundle with electric 
signal cables. The present invention provides even further improvements in 
size, weight, and flexibility for a given level of electric signal 
transmission speed and quality and
