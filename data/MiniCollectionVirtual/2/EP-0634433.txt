<ABSTRACT>
Mixtures containing     a) an aromatic polyisocyanate, b) a polyester having a mean molecular weight of from 600 to 5000, obtainable by self-condensation of ricinoleic acid, optionally in the presence of an initiator C2-C20-polyol, and optionally   c) additives are used as binders for the production of composite materials.

<CLAIMS>
Use of a mixture, containing 

a) an aromatic polyisocyanate, 
b) a polyester with an average molecular weight of 
600 to 5000, obtainable by self-condensation of 

ricinoleic acid, optionally with co-utilization 
of a C

 starter polyol, and optionally 
c) additives, 
 
optionally in combination with per se known 

polyhydroxylic compounds of molecular weight 400 to 
10,000, as binder for the production of composite 

materials. 
Use according to Claim 1, characterized in that the 
polyisocyanate a) is a polyisocyanate based on 

diphenylmethane diisocyanate. 
Use according to Claims 1 and 2, characterized in that 
the polyisocyanate a) is a mixture of diphenylmethane 

diisocyanates and polyphenyl-polymethylene 
polyisocyanates. 
Use according to Claims 1 to 3, characterized in that 
the polyester b) has an average molecular weight of 

620 to 3000. 
Use according to Claims 1 to 4, characterized in that 
1,6-hexanediol is used for the production of the 

polyester b).  
 
Use according to Claims 1 to 5, characterized in that 
the components a) and b) have been caused to react 

together completely or partially, optionally not until 
during the application. 
Use according to Claims 1 to 6, characterized in that 
the composite materials are ones based on materials 

containing cellulose and/or lignocellulose. 
Use according to Claims 1 to 7, characterized in that 
ground plastics are co-utilized for the production of 

the composite materials. 
Use according to Claim 8, characterized in that the 
co-utilized ground plastics are isocyanate-based.
