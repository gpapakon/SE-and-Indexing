<ABSTRACT>
Described is a method for providing improved liquid-solid 
separation performance in liquid particulate dispersion 

systems. The method comprises adding to a liquid system 
containing a plurality of finely divided particles (i) from 

about 22.7g to about 4.54kg per 907kg (about 0.05 to about 10 
pounds per ton), based upon the dry weight of the particles, 

of an ionic, organic cross linked polymeric microbead 
preferably with a diameter of less than about 500 nm, and 

(ii) from about 22.7g to about 9.07kg per 907kg (about 0.05 
to about 20 pounds per ton), same basis, of a polymeric 

material selected from the group consisting of 
polyethylenimines, modified polyethylenimines and mixtures 

thereof. Described are further compositions comprising the 
components mentioned above. Additives, such as organic ionic 

polysaccarides (eg a starch), may also be combined with the 
liquid system to facilitate separation of the particulate 

material therefrom. The compositions are especially useful in 
a process for making paper.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to compositions and methods for
providing improved separation of solids from liquid
particulate dispersions.Papermaking processes require treatment of a system
comprising a liquid dispersion of solid particles for
separating the solids therefrom. Fast drainage and greater
retention of fines contribute to lower costs in papermaking
and thus improvements in this area are always being sought.
Improvements in formation are likewise desired as such
improvements result in a better product. One method for
improving these properties, which was first practiced during
the 1980's, involves the use of colloidal silica and
bentonite. The improved drainage offered with the use of
these materials, i.e., as indicated by increasing speed and
efficiency with greater retention of fines, provides
significant cost savings over the prior art techniques.U.S. patent Nos. 4,385,165 and 4,388,150 describe a two-component
binder system comprising a cationic starch and an
anionic, colloidal silicic acid sol which acts as a retention
aid when combined with cellulose fibers in a paper-making
stock. Finnish published specification Nos. 67,735 and
67,736 disclose cationic polymer retention agent compounds
comprising cationic starch and polyacrylamide. These
materials are described by the subject references as being
useful when combined with an anionic silica in improving
sizing.U.S. patent No. 4,798,653 discloses the use of cationic
colloidal silica sol in combination with an anionic copolymer 
of acrylic acid and acrylamide for rendering paper stock
resistant to loss of its retention and dewatering properties
due to shear forces attributable to the papermaking process.A coacervate binder, three-component system composed of a
cationic starch, an anionic high molecular weight polymer and
dispersed silica having a particle diameter range from 1 to
50 nm is described in U.S. patent Nos. 4,643,801 and
4,750,974.The two Finnish patent publications noted above additionally
describe the use of bentonite with cationic starch and
polyacrylamides ("PAMs"). Further, U.S. patent No. 4,305,781
discloses a bentonite-type clay used in combination with
high-molecular weight, substantially non-ionic polymers such
as polyethylene oxides and PAMs for use as retention agents.
U.S. patent No. 4,753,710 discloses the use of bentonite with
a substantially linear, cationic polymer, e.g., cationic
acrylic polymers, polyethylene imine, polyamine
epichlorohydrin and dialkyl dimethyl ammonium chloride as
providing an improved
