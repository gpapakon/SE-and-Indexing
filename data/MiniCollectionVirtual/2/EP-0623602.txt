<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention pertains to ultraviolet light stabilizers 
for plastics and coating compositions, or more particularly, to 
novel types of compounds which are asymmetrical 
benzotriazolylphenols. It is well known in the art that plastics are unstable over time 
upon exposure to ultraviolet light. Such plastics undergo a 
decrease in mechanical strength and an increase in unwanted color 
when exposed to uv radiation. It is also known to improve the 
resistance of plastics and coating compositions to deterioration 
by the addition of a uv light absorber. Such commonly used 
stabilizers include compounds of the hydroxyphenyl benzotriazole 
family, including hydroxyphenyl benzotriazole monomers and 
dimers. Hydroxyphenyl benzotriazole monomers are well known in 
the art and are disclosed in earlier U.S. patents 3,204,896; 
3,189,6515; 5,097,041; 4,943,637 and 5,104,992. Hydroxyphenyl 
benzotriazole dimers are also known. The benzotriazole dimers have an advantage over the monomeric 
benzotriazole u.v. absorbers. The dimers have higher molecular 
weight which makes them much less volatile. This is very 
important considering the high temperatures required for the 
processing of engineering plastics. In addition, these dimers  
 
possess high thermal stability so they are not decomposed when 
exposed to elevated temperatures for prolonged periods of time. Benzotriazole type u.v. absorbers, including dimers, function 
through a mechanism involving the phenolic hydrogen and the 
nitrogens of the triazole ring. In attempts to reduce the 
volatility of benzotriazole monomers, various organic groups were 
added to the phenolic ring and/or halogens to the benzene ring of 
the benzotriazole. Volatility was usually reduced by 
substitution of one or two organic groups on the phenolic ring. 
While these measures did improve the volatility problem, it also 
reduced the total u.v. absorption capability of the benzotriazole 
monomers. Most commercial benzotriazoles which are available 
today are disubstituted. U.S. patents 4,684,679, and 4,812,498 disclose the symmetrical 
dimers 2,2'-methylene-bis-(4-hydrocarbyl-6 
benzotriazolylphenols). U.S. patents 4,684,679 and 4,937,348 
disclose a process for preparing the symmetrical dimers 2,2'-methylene-bis-(4-hydrocarbyl-6-benzotriazolylphenols) 
by first 
forming the Mannich base of a described benzotriazole monomer and 
then reacting the Mannich base with the same benzotriazole 
monomer or the same Mannich base. All of the above patents are 
incorporated herein by
