<ABSTRACT>
The present invention relates to an upper tool (9) for a press 
brake comprising a shank (9w) to be clamped to a support body (7) 

mounted on an upper table (3) by a clamping force of a pressing-down 
and fixing member (11). The upper tool is improved in that the 

shank is formed with an inclined surface (9c) for gradually 
increasing the clamping force of the pressing-down and fixing 

member to said upper tool by relative movement of said upper 
tool to the support body.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an upper tool for a press brake, said upper tool
comprising a shank adapted to be clamped to a holder body by a clamping forced of a
pressing-down and fixing member, wherein the shank has a clamp surface for
engagement with the pressing-down and fixing member.Such a tool for a press brake is previously known from EP-A-0 387 121. According to
this prior art document, the tool to be introduced into a clamp needs to be rotated to
be engaged with a lever, which co-operates with a spring actuated cam. Upon
rotation of the tool a spring is released so as to urge the lever and to turn into a
position where the tool and press brake are ready for operation.As is well known, a press brake is provided with an
upper table (referred to as an upper apron, sometimes) and a
lower cable (referred to as a lower apron, sometimes) arranged
in such a way as to be opposed to each other, and either of
the upper or lower cable is disposed movably in the vertical
direction.To bend a place like workpiece for instance, an upper
tool is mounted on the lower part of the upper cable, and a
lower tool is mounted on the upper part of the lower cable.
Therefore, when the movable side table is moved up and down so
that the upper and lower cools can be engaged with each other,
a workpiece positioned between the upper and lower tools is to
be bent.Further, in the above-mentioned press brake, a number of
upper tool holders are mounted on the lower part of the upper
table to exchange the upper tool with an appropriate one
according to the bending shape of the workpiece. In other
words, the upper tools are supported by a number of upper
holders so as to be exchanged.In the prior art upper tool holder, the structure is
such that an upper-tool pressing-down and fixing member is
mounted on a holder body attached to the lower part of the
upper table, and the upper-tool pressing-down and fixing
member is fastened with fastening bolts to tightly fasten and
fix the upper part of the upper tool between the holder body
and the upper tool clamp. Therefore, when the upper tool is required to be
exchanged with another one, since a number of fastening bolts
provided for a number of upper tool holders must be loosened,
there exists a problem in that the exchanging work of the
upper tool is extremely complicated and therefore troublesome.To overcome the above-mentioned problem, a structure
such that air cylinders are mounted on the upper tool holders
to fasten and loosen the upper-tool pressing-down and fixing
members has

<CLAIMS>
Upper tool (9) for a press brake, said upper tool comprising a shank adapted to
be clamped to a holder body (5) by a clamping force of a pressing-down and

fixing member (11),

wherein said shank has a clamp surface (9C) for engagement with the
pressing-down and fixing member (11),
characterized in that

the clamp surface (9C) is inclined in such a way that the shank becomes
narrower towards its end directed to the holder body (5) . 
Upper tool according to claim 1, 
characterized in that
 said inclined clamp surface
(9C) terminates in an upper end projection (9P) at the upper end of said shank

(9W).
Upper tool according to claim 1 or 2, 
characterized in that
 said shank (9W)
further comprises a slide surface (9S) opposite said clamp surface (9C) being

inclined with respect to said slide surface (9S).
Upper tool according to one of claims 1 to 3, 
characterized by
 a work processing
portion (9M) for processing a workpiece (W) in cooperation with a lower tool (59),

said work processing portion (9M) being provided at the lower end of said tool.
Upper tool according to one of claims 1 to 4 in combination with a press brake,
said press brake having a holder body (5) and a pressing-down and fixing

member (11) of an upper tool holding device (1) which is to be mounted on an
upper table (3) of the press brake, 
characterized in that
 the shank (9W) has a
contact surface (9F) to be brought into contact with a lower surface (7E) of a

support plate (7) provided on the holder body (5), and that the slide surface (9) is 
adapted to be brought into sliding contact with a vertical surface of said support

plate (7), and that the clamp surface (9C) is adapted to be brought into pressure
contact with a pressing-down and fixing section (11C) of said upper tool pressing-down

and fixing member (11).
Combination of an upper tool and a press brake according to claim 5,

characterized in that
 the upper end projection (9P) can engage with said
pressing-down and fixing section (11C).
Combination of an upper tool and a press brake according to claim 5 or 6,

characterized in that
 the vertical length of said clamp surface (9C) is greater
than a gap between the lower surface (7E) of the holder body (5) and said

contact surface (9F) forming a shoulder portion of said upper tool (9) when the
upper end projection (9P) engages the pressing-down and fixing member (11).
