connection adapter and an optical plug. The optical 

connection adapter includes a sleeve (12) to be attached to a 
first circuit board (1). The optical plug includes an optical 

contact (27) to be inserted into and removed from the sleeve, 
and a contact holding member (23) to be attached to a second 

circuit board (2). A variation of the optical connector 
comprises an optical connection adapter a
nd an optical 
socket. The optical connection adapter comprises a pipe, 

an optical fiber (26) arranged in the pipe, an optical connector 
connected to opposite ends of the optical fiber, and a 

contact holding member (23) which is inserted into the pipe to 
be movable along the cylindrical axis and which is for 

holding the optical contact. The optical socket comprises 
a socket housing which has an insertion hole for removably 

receiving the optical contact (25) and which is to be attached 
to the second circuit board, and a mating optical contact 

which is fixed to the socket housing and which is to be 
brought into contact with the optical contact through the 

insertion hole. In addition, an optical fiber unit which 
forms a part of the optical connection adapter comprises an 

optical fiber, an optical contact connected to opposite 
ends of the optical fiber, and a contact holding member for 

holding the optical contact to be movable along the optical

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to an optical connector
for use in a communication apparatus or the like and, in
particular, to an optical connector comprising an optical
connection adapter with means for connection/disconnection
of an optical contact.Generally, a recent communication apparatus
includes a plurality of circuit boards. For
interconnection between those circuit boards, use is made
of an optical connector in addition to an electrical
connector, as shown in Fig. 1.Referring to Fig. 1, a printed wiring board 1 has
the opposite surfaces each of which is for mounting a
circuit board 2 to be arranged perpendicular to the
printed wiring board 1. The printed wiring board 1 is
provided with an electrical connector 3 so as to
interconnect the circuit boards 2 on the opposite
surfaces. The circuit boards 2 are also connected through
an optical connector. The optical connector comprises
optical plugs 6 and an adapter 7 attached to the printed
wiring board 1. An optical cable 5 is connected to each
optical plug 6. The optical cable 5 is also connected to
a converter 4 placed on each circuit board 2. The
adapter 7 serves to facilitate interconnection between
the optical plugs 6.However, the optical connector illustrated in
Fig. 1 is a so-called single core connector having one
optical contact 8. Therefore, a relatively wide space is
required for connection of one optical connector.
Consequently, such a conventional optical connector is
not suitable for connection of a plurality of connectors.
In addition, the conventional optical connector is
disadvantageous in that it takes a lot of labor for
mounting operation.An example for a conventional connector is found in WO 85/04492 A.It is therefore an object of this invention to
provide an optical connector which requires a relatively
small space per one optical connector and which can
improve efficiency in mounting operation.The present invention is defined by the attached claim 1. According to this invention, an
optical connection adapter is obtained which comprises a
pipe to be attached to a through hole of a circuit board
so as to extend from one surface to other surface of the
circuit board, an optical fiber inserted into the pipe, a
first and a second optical contact connected to opposite
ends of the optical fiber, respectively, and a first and
a second contact holding member for holding the first and
the second optical contacts, respectively, and coupled to
the pipe to be movable along a cylindrical axis of the
pipe. The optical connection adapter is mated with
