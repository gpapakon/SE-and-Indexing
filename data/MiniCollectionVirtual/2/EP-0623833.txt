<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention generally relates to a broadband rugate filter and, in 
particular, relates to one such broadband rugate filter having a sinusoidal index of 
refraction versus optical thickness profile having a frequency that continuously changes in 
a single direction. Rugate filters differ from discrete stacked filters in that the index of refraction of 
the rugate varies as a function of the thickness of the deposited film. Typically, the 
optical thickness of the refractive index period determines the reflection band position and 
the amplitude of the variation of the index of refraction determines the reflection 
bandwidth. As generally known, multiple reflection bands can be generated by serially 
depositing individual index of refraction profiles for each reflection band or, alternatively, 
by superimposing multiple index of refraction profiles and depositing the bands in 
parallel. The use of superposition allows for increased film complexity without adding to 
the mechanical thickness of the deposited film. In instances where superimposed indices 
exceed the material indices or result in excessively high slew rates of the material 
sources, both serial and parallel techniques can be used. Conventional rugate filters are designed using pure sine wave gradient index of 
refraction versus thickness profiles for example, as disclosed in US-A- 4 952 025. The bandwidth of the reflection notch is related to 
the excursion of the index of refraction, i. e., the amplitude of the sine wave. The 
maximum bandwidth is therefore limited to the maximum difference in the refractive 
indices of the constituent materials. For typical infrared materials, such as ZnSe and 
ThF4, this limiting bandwidth is about 15 %. In order to make a broader reflection band, 
reflectors designed for different wavelengths can be deposited serially. The difficulty 
with this technique is the presence of spectral leaks, or narrow pass bands, due to phase 
effects between the stacked rugate reflectors. Consequently, it is highly desirable to provide a broadband rugate filter that  
 
substantially completely overcomes the above-recited difficulties of conventional rugate 
filters. Accordingly, it is one object of the present invention to provide a broadband 
rugate filter that does not exhibit spectral leaks. This object is accomplished by a broadband rugate filter 
as defined in claim 1. Other objects and advantages of the present invention will become apparent to 
those skilled in the art from the following detailed
