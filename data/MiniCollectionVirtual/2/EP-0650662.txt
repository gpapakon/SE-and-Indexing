<ABSTRACT>
A harvester (lifter-loader) of root crops includes two very wide front driving and guiding wheels (3, 4), lifting members (6) mounted at the front and a system for simultaneous cleaning and conveying directing the root crops to a large-capacity hopper. The harvester includes two turbines (7, 8) driven in rotation (F7, F8) under which there is mounted a set of rollers (9, 10, 11) for transporting the root crops as far as a conveyor belt (13) situated between the said front wheels (3, 4). Application to the harvesting of root crops, particularly beet.

<CLAIMS>
A self-propelled harvester for beetroot or other
tubers, of the type comprising, from front to back:

leaf-removing elements, beet-lifting elements, takeup
elements of the turbine type which clean and convey the

beetroot to the rear by rotating, driving and guiding
wheels of great width, between the front wheels a

conveyor belt, and at the rear of the conveyor belt
means for taking up the beetroot to convey them towards

a large-capacity hopper, characterised in that it
comprises, between the two turbines (7, 8) for taking

up the beetroot and the conveyor belt (13), a set of
rollers which receive the beetroot from the two

turbines (7, 8) and convey them to the conveyor belt
(13), this unit being capable of firstly being inserted

beneath the rear part of the turbines and in the free
space between the rear edges of the turbines, and

secondly being connected to the front edge of the
conveyor belt.
A harvester according to Claim 1, characterised in
that the rollers (9, 10a, 10b, 10, 11) are placed

transversely, that is to say, with their axes of
rotation transversely to the working direction (A).
A harvester according to Claim 1, characterised in
that the rollers (30-33) are placed longitudinally,

that is to say, with their axes of rotation
substantially close to the working direction (A).
A harvester according to Claim 1, characterised in
that at least one roller (9, 10a, 10b, 11; 34) is a

concentrator roller and has an outer surface which acts
on the tubers to concentrate them in the centre of this

roller. 
A harvester according to Claim 2, characterised in
that the length of the rollers decreases towards the

front.
