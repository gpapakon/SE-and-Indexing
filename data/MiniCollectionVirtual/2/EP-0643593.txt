<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates generally to medical
devices and methods
for obtaining substantially leukocyte free
platelet concentrate.In medical practice it is sometimes desirable to
transfuse patients with quantities of platelet concentrate
as a means for treating thrombocytopenia and/or subnormal
thrombocyte counts as may result from various systemic
disorders or following certain medical procedures.
Typically, such platelet transfusions are administered in
the form of a platelet-plasma concentrate containing
approximately 1.5-1.8 million platelets per microliter of
plasma. Such platelet concentrate is typically packaged
and utilized in "units", each unit having a volume of 200
milliliters.Platelet concentrates for transfusion have heretofore
typically been prepared by first extracting platelet-rich
plasma from whole blood, and subsequently subjecting the
platelet-rich plasma to a secondary concentration process
whereby additional plasma is removed so as to leave the
desired platelet concentration of 1.5-1.8 million platelets
per microliter. One example of an automated method/device
for obtaining platelet concentrate from whole blood is
described in Schoendorfer, D.W., Williamson, L.H.,
Sheckler, V.L. and Fitzgerald, B.P.: Platelet Collection
with the Autopheresis-CÂ® Apheresis System; Vox Sanguinis,
58:100-105(1990).The instrumentation and methodology heretofore utilized
to obtain platelet concentrate generally allows quantities
of contaminating leukocytes to remain in the final platelet
concentrate. By some processes, the level of contaminating 
leukocytes contained in the platelet concentrate may be in
the range of 106-109 leukocytes per 200 ml unit of platelet
concentrate.The presence of leukocytes within the platelet
concentrate is undesirable because leukocytes are much more
immunogenic than platelets. The presence of contaminating
leukocytes in platelet concentrate infusions may have been
associated with various responses that are detrimental to
the recipient of the transfusion. Such responses may
include pyrogenic febrile reactions, refractoriness to
platelet transfusions due to alloimmunization to HLA
antigens found on the surfaces of the leukocytes and graft-host
diseases caused by transfusion of lymphocytes into
immunodeficient patients. Also, the presence of
contaminating leukocytes may result in transmission of
leukocyte-associated viral diseases, many of which may
cause severe illness or even death.In view of the adverse effects associated with the
presence of leukocytes in platelet

A method of preparing substantially leukocyte free platelet-containing
plasma comprising passing a substantially red blood cell free,

leukocyte contaminated, platelet-containing plasma from a source onto a
rotatable cylindrical membrane filter (60b) having a multiplicity of pores

formed therein, said pores being sufficiently small to prevent passage
therethrough of leukocytes, while rotating the filter to separate said

plasma into leukocyte depleted platelet-containing plasma which passes
through said pores and is collected, and a leukocyte fraction which does

not pass through said pores.
The method of Claim 1 wherein said leukocyte platelet-containing
plasma is passed onto said rotating cylindrical membrane at a rate of

approximately 80-120 ml/min.
The method of Claim 1 or 2 wherein said cylindrical membrane is
rotated at a rate sufficient to prevent the pores of said membrane from

being clogged.
The method of Claim 3 comprising rotating said cylindrical
membrane at a rate of approximately 1600-1800 rpm.
The method of any preceding claim wherein said leukocyte
fraction is recirculated to said source and the step of passing platelet-containing

plasma onto said filter is carried out repeatedly until a desired
reduction in the leukocyte content of the platelet-containing plasma has

been effected. 
The method of any preceding claim wherein the step of passing
platelet-containing plasma onto said filter is repeated successively three

to four times.
The method of any preceding claim, wherein the rate of rotation
of said filter (60b) is maintained within the range of approximately 1600-1800

rpm.
The method of any preceding claim wherein the cylindrical
