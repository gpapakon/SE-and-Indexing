<ABSTRACT>
An address buffer which allows for the simultaneous selection and/or 
deselection of a plurality of rows and/or columns within a memory array. A first 

and a second circuit generate a true and a complementary signal, respectively, 
during normal operations of the integrated circuit. When desired, the first and 

second circuits may be used to generate two signals of the same voltage level. 
The two signals of the same voltage level may then be used by an address 

decoder to simultaneously select and/or deselect a plurality of rows and/or 
columns within a memory array.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates in general to integrated circuits, and more
particularly to memory arrays in integrated circuits. Still more particularly, the
present invention relates to address buffers.Address buffers are used in many circuits, with one example being memory
arrays. Address buffers are used, in conjunction with decoders, to select row or
bit lines within a memory array. Usually only a certain number of row and bit
lines may be selected at any point in time.For some test or operating modes of the memory array, however, selection
of all or a portion of row and/or bit lines at a single time is desirable. An
example of a test mode where selecting all or a portion of the row and bit lines
at a single time is necessary is described in United States Patent
5 424 988, entitled Stress Test For Memory Arrays In Integrated
Circuits, filed September 30, 1992. A plurality of rows are selected at one time
and a stress voltage is placed on a plurality of bit and complementary bit lines.
In this manner the memory cells within the memory array are stress tested in
order to detect latent defects.Another example of a test mode where selecting all of the row and bit
lines at a single time is necessary is described in United States Patent
5 341 336 entitled Stress Test For Decoders In Integrated
Circuits, filed April 30, 1993. A plurality of rows and bit lines are selected or
deselected simultaneously and a stress voltage is applied to the integrated circuit.
In this manner, latent defects within the decoders and periphery circuits can be
detected. US-A- 4342103 (Higuchi et al) and US-A-4 651 304 (Takata) both describe an address buffer
circuit for use in a memory device which enables high speed
testing of the memory device. The address buffer can output
'1' or '0', i.e. the same voltage level, from both a positive output terminal and a negative
output terminal when an input having a signal level different
from the usual signal level is applied to an input of the
address buffer so that a plurality of word lines can be
selected at a time.Therefore, it is desirable to provide a circuit which
allows for the simultaneous selection or deselection of a
plurality of rows and columns within a memory array. It is
also desirable that such a circuit be compact and not
significantly affect the normal operation of the integrated
circuit.An address buffer is provided which allows for the
simultaneous selection or deselection of a plurality of rows
and/or columns within a memory array. A first and a second
circuit generate
