<ABSTRACT>
Containers are produced from a sheet (200) of flexible material having a thermally bondable inside surface. In one embodiment flaps (205/206) are formed and folded outwardly to form two windows (208, 209) in the sheet. Pleasts (211/212) are formed and bonded to transverse the windows so that a pleat ply closes the windows. The pleats (211/212) are folded to bring the flaps (205/206) against the window closing pleat plies and bonded. In another embodiment holes (230/231) are cut in the sheet (200) located in one ply of the pleats.

<DESCRIPTION>
 CONTAINERTECHNICAL FIELDThe present invention relates to the packaging industry, and more particularly to a flexible container, as well as a method for making same- Traditional means for packaging products, particularly liquids, have included metal cans and glass and plastic bottles. Cans and bottles have the advantage of being hermetically sealable, are of sturdy construction, and may be stored in a self-supported upright position.However, a number of problems exist in the use of cans and bottles. For example, their production methods are complicated and expensive. The raw materials used in producing such containers are also expensive. Furthermore, traditional cans and bottles present environmental problems in that, even in their empty state, they occupy a relatively large amount of space, whether it be at a landfill or in a kitchen garbage can. Finally, cans and bottles are rather heavy and therefore are inconvenient and expensive to transport.BACKGROUND ARTIn an attempt to overcome the reliance upon cans and bottles, packages have recently begun to use flexible, fusible sheet material in forming disposable containers, 

such as found in U.S. Patent No. 3,380,646 to Doyen et al and U.S. Patent No, 4,287,247 to Reil et al. Such containers are problematic, however, in that they have interior crevices in their bottoms and corners which may act as bacterial traps. Furthermore, they must be produced from relatively thick, and therefore expensive, retort material to be capable of standing upright without support. Even if manufactured with such thick material, the packages are typically unstable and must be supported on the shelves of a store by a box or other means. Also, the flexible containers used to date usually have at least one weld on their interior bottom wall, which is in the location of the most pressure from liquid or other packaged products. As a result, there is a structural weakness at the bottom portions of most currently used containers.The methods employed in producing the currently used flexible containers are complicated in that they require a relatively large number of welding steps, many of which must be performed while the container material is in a vertical orientation. As a result, the apparatus for forming the container is by necessity complicated and expensive.There exists a need, therefore, for a container which is hermetically sealable, lightweight, and which is flexible so as not to occupy a large volume of space when emptied.There exists a further need for a flexible container

 CLAIMS
1. A method of producing a container from a sheet of flexible material having a thermally bondable inside surface, and with the method comprising the steps of cutting the material to form two flaps; folding the flaps outwardly from the sheet to form two windows in the sheet; forming and thermally bonding two portions together of each of two pleats from which two folds of the sheet extend to form the container sides, the pleats transversing the windows so that one ply of each pleat closes a window; folding the pleats to bring inside surfaces of the flaps against the window closing pleat plies; thermally bonding the flaps to the window closing pleat plies thereby forming a thermally bonded double wall container bottom; and thermally bonding together side edge portions of the two container side forming folds.
2. The method of claim 1 wherein two diagonal bonds are heat sealed in the two pleats to each side of the flaps.
3. A container formed in accordance with the method of claim 1.
4. The container of claim 3 wherein the outside surface of the sheet of material is thermally non-bondable to itself.
5. A method of producing a container from a sheet of flexible material having a thermally bondable inside surface, and with the method comprising the steps of cutting the material to form at least two holes therein; forming and thermally bonding two pleats with each pleat having a ply that overlays and closes one of the holes and 


with the pleats straddling a container bottom portion of the sheet and from which pleats two sheet folds extend to form the container sides; folding the pleats onto the sheet bottom portion and thermally bonding that portion of the pleat plies that close the holes to the container bottom portion thereby forming a thermally bonded triple wall container bottom; and thermally bonding together side edge portions of the container side forming folds.
6. The method of claim 5 wherein two diagonal bonds are heat sealed in the two pleats to each side of the hole of each pleat.
7. A container formed in accordance with the method of claim 5.
8. The container of claim 7 wherein the outside surface of the sheet of material is thermally non-bondable to itself.
