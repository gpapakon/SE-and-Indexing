<ABSTRACT>
The fuel injection system includes a dual fuel injection nozzle (12), with a pressure chamber (11) where fuel and an addition fluid are alternating supplied. A valve arrangement, has a controllable high-pressure fuel supply to the dual fuel injection nozzle. The connection of the pressure room with a low-pressure side and with an inlet conductor (26) of the additional fluid are also controllable. The valve arrangement includes a switching valve (16) which is formed, both for the control of the supply of the pressure chamber with high or low pressure, as well as for the control of the filling of the pressure chamber with the additional fluid.

<CLAIMS>
Fuel injection system for an internal combustion
engine, with a dual-fuel injection nozzle (12), in

the pressure space (11) of which fuel and an
additional liquid can be conveyed alternately, and

with a valve arrangement, by means of which the
high-pressure-side supply of fuel to the dual-fuel

injection nozzle (12) and the connection of the
pressure space (11) to a low-pressure side and to

a supply line (26) for the additional liquid can
be controlled, 
characterized in that
 the fuel
injection system possesses only a single

changeover valve (16) which is designed both for
activating the action of high or low pressure upon

the pressure space (11) and for activating the
filling of the pressure space (11) with the

additional liquid.
Fuel injection system according to Claim 1,

characterized in that
 the changeover valve (16) is
a multi-way solenoid valve.
Fuel injection system according to Claim 1 or 2,

characterized in that
 the changeover valve (16) is
installed in the fuel high-pressure connection

between a common-rail pressure accumulator (29)
and the pressure space (11).
