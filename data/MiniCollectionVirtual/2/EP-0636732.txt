<ABSTRACT>
The condenser consists of a hollow body (1), through which moist process air can flow essentially from the bottom upwards, and, for cooling purposes, is flushed with mains water in the inflow via a switchable valve. For the purpose of differentiating the condensation operation from a lint-flushing operation requiring a large amount of flushing water, the invention provides for dimensioning the inflow (4) for a water stream which is suitable for flushing lint out of the hollow body (1) and for the inflow (4) to be operable intermittently for the supply of cooling water.

<CLAIMS>
Washing machine equipped for drying and with a condenser which 
consists of a hollow body, through which moist process air can flow 

substantially upwards from below, and which for cooling purposes is 
flushed by mains water by way of a switchable valve in the inlet, 

characterised thereby, that the inlet (4) is dimensioned for a water 
flow, which is suitable for the fluff-rinsing of the hollow body (1), and 

is operable intermittently for the feeding of cooling water. 
Washing machine according to claim 1, characterised thereby, that the 
inlet (4) is aimed at a baffle plate (5), which distributes the cooling 

water in bell shape to all sides. 
Washing machine according to claim 1 or 2, characterised thereby, 
that projections (6), which protrude into the process air flow and guide 

cooling water, which is flowing down at the walls, into the air flow, are 
arranged in the lower region of the hollow body (1). 
Washing machine according to one of the preceding claims, 
characterised thereby, that an accumulation chamber (8) for the cooling 

water is arranged in the outflow region of the inlet (4) in the upper 
region of the hollow body (1) and provided with outflow openings (10) 

permitting the delayed outflow of accumulated cooling water. 
Washing machine according to claim 4, characterised thereby, that the 
outflow openings (10) are directed into the process air flow.
