<ABSTRACT>
The "PRESS" Method relates to the Management of Municipal Solid Waste, 
following the on-site separation of recyclable materials. 

The innovative aspect of this invention relates to the intensive compression that 
produces compact blocks of compressed waste of optimum volume and size. 

Thus, neutralisation of the waste can be achieved within hours after their 
collection. Other advantages of the method are: the achievement of significant 

cost savings during the transportation process; the optimization of the 
landfilling operations; the control of the biogas generation and collection 

process. Thus, the service time of Sanitary Landfills is doubled, whereas the 
potential for future exploitation of waste is preserved. The method preserves 

the environment, protects the public health and improves working conditions at 
all stages of its application. 
The "PRESS" Method is applicable to large urban and to small rural areas 
(including remotely located areas in the mainland or in the islands) alike In the 

case of small, remote areas its operation will diminish the need for conventional 
landfills and will permit the application of central planning in Waste 

Management.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention, which for brevity's sake is only referred to by the name of
"PRESS", relates to the process of Municipal Solid Waste Management and
covers all related activities, i.e. the collection of waste by the collection
vehicles of the Municipality, the transportation to and the landfilling in the
specially designed Areas for Sanitary Landfilling of Waste (ASLW), and the
collection and the exploitation of the biogass produced in the ASLWs. All
materials which will be recycled must be separated on-site, otherwise they
will be treated according to the principles of the "PRESS" method. This is a
prerequisite for the application of the method.At present, solid waste materials are treated in a variety of methods:
By Combustion: This is a straightforward and inexpensive solution,
which leads to the loss of valuable raw materials and to significant
environmental load. Also, the danger of spread of fire when this method is
applied is always imminent.By conventional and sanitary landfilling:. This method requires
large areas of land and significant capital expenditure for infrastructure
work, especially for the protection of the underground water streams (the
protection of which is often, as in the case of Greece, of paramount
importance.)By recycling: In practical terms, only few materials are recyclable.
The non recyclable materials (accounting for almost half of the waste
material produced) must be treated in other methods. Recycling practices
also face significant related with the collection and the separation of the raw
materials and the distribution and marketing of the products of recycling.Partial compression and landfilling (Baling System): A
prerequisite of the application of this method is the separation of recyclable 
material on-site. This is a practical and efficient method. However, the
danger of pollution of underground water is always imminent. Another issue
of major concern is the exploitation of the biogas generated, which, should it
be left uncontrolled, may lead to dangerous situations.By Super-Compression: This method is not fully evaluated yet. In
this method, waste are being pressed and peletised. The resulting
compressed waste pellets can be used in the bedding layers of various
constructions works. Naturally, the application of this method excludes the
possibility of exploitation of the energy content of waste material. Another
drawback is that it is not always possible to trace the locations where such
pellets will be used. Thus, it is possible that, should they contain toxic

A method for the disposal of municipal waste providing for volume reduction by
compaction into appropriate blocks which are stacked in sanitary landfills, the method

allowing percolation of leachate through the waste material in the landfill and being
characterised in that,


the blocks are packaged after compaction and
perforated tubes are inserted in the packaged blocks in order to provide escape
channels for escaping biogas and leachate.
The method of claim 1 characterised in that the compaction reduces the volume of
waste at a ratio of from 7:1 to 9:1 by compressing it in several stages.
The method of claims 1 or 2 characterised in that recyclable material is sorted out
on-site, prior to the compacting.
The method of any of the preceding claims characterised in that a first precompacting
stage is effected by a screw conveyor and two compacting stages in

hydraulic piston presses follow to produce rectangular blocks, preferably of dimensions
of 1.0 m x 0.5 m x 0.5 m with a density of 1400 kg/m
3
.
The method of any of the preceding claims characterised in that the biogas is
drawn off from the landfill through a piping network that is installed around the cell

structure created by the stacked waste blocks.
Apparatus for the production of bales of municipal waste, comprising multiple
stage compaction means (HSP1, VHP2, HHP3,), characterised by means for providing

small holes through the packaging cover of the bales for the insertion of perforated
tubes.
Apparatus according to claim 6 further characterised by a precompaction means
(HSP1), a first chamber and piston compactor (VHP2) and a second compaction

chamber and piston (HHP3), wherein the

the precompaction means is a screw conveyor (HSP1)
the first and second compaction chambers having each a lateral inlet opening for
the precompacted waste,
screw conveyor and first and second compactions chambers being arranged
mutually at substantially right angles.
