<ABSTRACT>
Novel substituted aromatic polyetherketone gas separation membranes 
and the process of using such membranes to separate one or more gases from a 

gaseous mixture is disclosed. The polyetherketones are formed from aromatic 
alcohols of the formula 


 
where Z is independently alkyl groups having 1 to 10 carbon atoms, most 

preferably a tertiary butyl group, n is an integer from 1 to 4, preferably 1.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to aromatic polyetherketone gas separation
membranes and the process for separating one or more gases from a gaseous
mixture using such membranes. The polyetherketones are derived from certain alkyl
substituted aromatic alcohols. The inventive gas separation membranes exhibit
exceptionally good permeation rates with good selectivity.Aromatic polyetherketones, particularly polyetherketones made from
aromatic alcohols are well known in the art. Gas separation membranes made
from certain polyetherketones are also known in the art. For example, U.S.
Patent 5,115,076 describes aromatic polyetherketones derived from aromatic
ketones having a bivalent diphenolate residue. Such polymers may be
fabricated into membranes which show a combination of high gas permeability,
high flame resistance and high thermal and mechanical stability.The polyetherketone membrane compositions of the prior art,
although useful as gas separating membranes, not only suffer from the
disadvantages of having to satisfy specific structural constraints, but are also
difficult to fabricate into configurations such as hollow fiber membranes
because these compositions tend to be soluble in relatively few solvents.
Moreover, the membranes of the prior art tend to have relatively low flux. A
need therefore exists for fluid separation membranes that avoid the fabrication
and solubility problems of the prior art that also provide improved gas
separation properties.The present invention relates to certain substituted aromatic
polyetherketone separation membranes which are particularly useful for
separating gases and the process for using them. This class of membrane
materials compositionally contain alcohols which incorporate substituted
aromatic units, preferably alkyl substituted aromatic units, more preferably alkyl
substituted biphenol, most preferably tertiary butyl substituted biphenol.
Membranes formed from this class of polyetherketone materials exhibit superior
gas permeability and good selectivity. It is believed that the high permeabilities
of some gases from multicomponent mixtures is due to the molecular free 
volume in the polymer which is created by the alkyl substituents on the aromatic
alcohols.The present invention relates to the discovery that gas separation membranes
exhibiting exceptional gas permeability can be obtained by forming such
gas separation membranes from polyetherketones, which incorporate units derived from a substituted
aromatic alcohol having the structural formula :

where Z is a

<CLAIMS>
A gas separation membrane made of a polyetherketone having the following
repeating formula:



where Z is a tertiary butyl group and Ar is selected from the resorcinol diol moiety
or the 4,4'-[2,2,2-trifluoro (trifluoromethyl) ethylidene]
 bisphenol diol moiety, q, s
and t are fractions from 0 to 1, r is 0.5 to 1, q + s = 1 and r + t = 1.
A process for separating one or more gases from a gaseous mixture comprising
bringing said gaseous mixture into contact with the first side of the gas

separation membrane according to claim 1, in a manner to cause a portion of the
mixture to pass through the membrane to a permeate side, the resulting gas mixture

on the permeate side being enriched in one or more component over that of
the mixture on the first side.
