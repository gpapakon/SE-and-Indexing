<ABSTRACT>
An ultrasound catheter (10) for removing obstructions from tubular anatomic structures such as blood vessels, said catheter comprising an elongate flexible catheter body (20) having an ultrasound transmission member or wire (24) extending longitudinally therethrough. A distal head (26) is formed on the distal end of the ultrasound transmission member or wire (24) and is affixed to the catheter body (20). The ultrasound transmission member or wire may be formed of any material capable of transmitting ultrasonic energy including various superelastic metal alloys such as nickel titanium metal alloys. The distal portion of the ultrasound transmission member or wire (24) may be of reduced diameter to provide enhanced flexibility and/or amplification of the ultrasonic energy through the distal portion of the ultrasound transmission member or wire. A proximal end connector (12) may be provided with a sonic connector to effectively couple the catheter (10) to the ultrasound transducer (14).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention pertains to medical equipment and more
particularly an ultrasonic catheter for ablating obstructions
within tubular anatomical structures such as blood vessels.A number of ultrasonic devices have heretofore been proposed
for use in ablating or removing obstructive material from blood
vessels. Examples of ultrasonic ablation devices in related
apparatus purported to be useable in removing obstructions from
blood vessels include those described in United States Patent Nos.

Michael, et al.), DE3,821,836 (Schubert) and DE2,438,648 (Pohlman).
Reference is also made to EP-A-0566656 which is part of the
state of the art under Article 54(3)EPC.Ultrasound transmitting catheters have been utilized to
successfully ablate various types of obstructions from blood 
vessels of humans and animals. Particular success has been
observed in ablation of atherosclerotic plaque or thromboembolic
obstructions from peripheral blood vessels such as the femoral
arteries. Successful applications of ultrasonic energy to smaller
blood vessels, such as the coronary arteries, necessitates the use
of ultrasound transmitting catheters which are sufficiently small
and flexible to permit transluminal advancement of such catheter
through the tortuous vasculature of the aortic arch and coronary
tree. Accordingly, the safety and efficacy of removing
obstructions from coronary arteries by way of ultrasound is largely
dependent upon the size and flexibility of the ultrasound
transmitting catheter(s) employed.Thus, there exists a need in the art for improved ultrasound
catheters which are sufficiently flexible to be advanced and
inserted into both small tortuous blood vessels, such as the
coronaries arteries.The present invention provides catheters as in claims 1 and 2. The
pre-ambles of these claims are based on WO-A-90/1300.In accordance with a preferred embodiment of the invention, there is
provided an
ultrasound catheter device comprising an elongate flexible catheter
body having at least one lumen extending longitudinally
therethrough. An elongate ultrasound transmission member extends
through the catheter body and is connected, at its distal end, to
a distal head. The entire distal head, or a
