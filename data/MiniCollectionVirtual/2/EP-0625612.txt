<ABSTRACT>
A building set for a retaining wall, in particular for noise protection embankments, walls or the like, consists essentially of cuboid-shaped concrete boxes 3, 3' having at least one inner chamber 2, which are positively interconnected in the region of outer grooves 4, vertical in the stacked position, via an insertion element 5; 25, 25', 25'' engaging in said grooves at least in certain regions. The concrete boxes 3, 3' are in each case provided in the region of their transverse and/or longitudinal side walls 7, 8 with at least one inner groove 9, 9' running parallel to the outer grooves 4.

A construction set for a retaining wall (1), particularly 
for interior and exterior soundproof walls or the like, 

which consists of substantially parallelepiped concrete 
boxes (3, 3') comprising at least one inner chamber (2) and 

which, in the region of external grooves (4) which are 
vertical in the stacked position, are form-lockingly 

connected to one another by a push-in element (5, 25, 25', 
25") of which at least portions engage said outer grooves 

(4), characterised in that the concrete boxes (3, 3') are 
provided in the region of their respective transverse and/or 

longitudinal side walls (7, 8; 14, 15) with at least one 
internal groove (9, 9') extending parallel with the external 

grooves (4). 
A construction set according to Claim 1, characterised in 
that the concrete boxes (3, 3') are provided with a 

plurality of equally long internal grooves (9, 9') extending 
over a portion (T) of the respective wall height (H). 
A construction set according to Claim 1 or 2, characterised 
in that the concrete boxes (3, 3') provided are in each case 

double-chamber boxes having in the upper region of their 
transverse side walls (7, 8) mutually facing inner grooves 

(9, 9') these extending as far as an inner supporting 
shoulder (11). 
A construction set according to Claim 3, characterised in 
that the double-chamber box (3, 3') comprises a central web 

(13) which is lowered vis-Ã -vis the upper supporting surface 
(12) and which defines with the supporting shoulder (11) an 

inner supporting surface of the same height.  
 
A construction set according to Claim 4, characterised in 
that at least one of the longitudinal side walls (15) of the 

double-chamber box (3, 3') is lowered as far as the height 
of the inner supporting surface (11, 13), forming a 

receiving pocket (16) which is open on one side. 
A construction set according to one of Claims 3 to 5, characterised in that 
at least one of the push-in elements (5; 25, 25', 25") can be form-lockingly 

accommodated in the area between the inner groove (9, 9') of the 
double-chamber box (3, 3'). 
A construction set according to Claim 6, characterised in 
that as a push-in element (5), a box part (21, 21') is 

provided which has respective outer ribs or outer grooves 
(4') and which is, when in the stacked position, supported 

on the inner supporting surface (11, 13) of the double-chamber 
box. 
A construction set according to Claim 5 and Claim 7, 
characterised in that two box parts (21, 21') are provided 

which have the same shape and which substantially fill the 
receiving pocket (16). 
A construction set according to Claim 7 or 8, characterised 
in that, in the stacked position, the inner groove (9, 9') 

of the double-chamber box and the outer grooves (4') of the 
box parts (21, 21') form a laying gap (22). 
A construction set according to Claim 6, characterised in 
that the push-in element which is provided as a plate part 

(25, 25', 25"), is so dimensioned that in the stacked 
position of the double-chamber boxes, it engages both 

respective outer grooves (4) of adjacent boxes (3) and also  
 

the inner grooves (9, 9') of a box (3) which happens to be 
below and/or above it. 
A construction set according to Claim 10, characterised in 
that the plate part (25, 25', 25") has, on the marginal area 

(26) which is vertical in the stacked position, an 
engagement contour (27) which can be adapted to different 

laying contours of the double-chamber boxes (3, 3'). 
A construction set according to one of Claims 1 to 11, 
characterised in that the concrete boxes (3, 3') and the 

push-in elements (21, 21') respectively have a polygonal 
base surface for their form-locking connection.
