<ABSTRACT>
A method for manufacturing a liquid-containing 
microelectronic device package. The method includes steps of 

providing (32) a base (16) including a microelectronic device 
(22) and a seal area disposed peripherally about the base (16), 

providing (34) a lid (12) and providing (34) a sealant (14) 
disposed between the base (16) and lid (12). The method also 

includes steps of immersing (36) the base (16), sealant (14) and 
lid (12) in a liquid (24) having a temperature above a sealant 

activation temperature and maintaining (38) the base (16), 
sealant (14) and lid (12) in the liquid (24) for a time sufficient 

to allow the liquid (24) to enter between the base (16) and lid 
(12) and to heat and thereby activate the sealant (14). The 

method further includes removing (40) the base (16), lid (12) 
and sealant (14) from the liquid (24) to provide a sealed, liquid-containing 

microelectronic device package (10).

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates, in general, to the field of packaging for 
microelectronic components, and more particularly to a simple 
liquid-containing package having improved manufacturability. Recent trends in manufacturing of electronic equipment 
place increased emphasis on reliability and robustness of 
components employed in such equipment. Effective heat 
dissipation for power devices pose particular problems for 
several reasons. Typically, photolithographically defined 
structures on a top surface of a semiconductor device generate 
heat while thermally conductive attachment to a heatsink is 
effected via a bottom surface thereof. Heat thus is coupled 
from the active device area, through the die and then to the 
heatsink. As integration levels increase, larger amounts of heat 
are generated at the top surface and coupled through 
semiconductor materials having relatively poor thermal 
conductivity and heat capacity, which can determine the 
maximum packing density of large scale integrated circuits 
and/or large-signal or power semiconductor devices. Devices 
atop the die surface which are not necessarily generating heat 
themselves are heated by nearby structures, affecting the 
electronic properties thereof. One approach to heat removal which has been attempted is 
to place the semiconductor device in a specially designed liquid-containing 
device package and lid. A dielectric liquid having 
benign chemical properties and suitable thermal properties (e.g., 
vaporization and solidification temperatures) is employed. 
Prior art packages employ heat exchanging structures and/or 
bellows to accommodate the liquid-containing cavity and to 
allow for thermal expansion, etc. These arrangements are not 
cost-effective for many microelectronic packaging applications.  
 
Furthermore, techniques developed to date for evacuating the 
cavity and back-filling same with dielectric liquids are 
complex, labor-intensive and poorly suited to volume production. 
Moreover, approaches employing large cavities and relatively 
small volumes of liquid therein are not able to maintain the 
liquid in contact with the chip area absent gravity, in the 
presence of some accelerations and/or unless the package is in a 
particular position, which tends to limit the applications for 
which such packages are well suited. What are needed are methods and apparatus for providing 
liquid-filled or liquid-containing semiconductor device packages 
which also provide improved manufacturability and which are 
suited to a broad range
