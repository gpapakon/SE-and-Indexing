<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a braking arm of a ski brake which has a transversely extending, plate-shaped extension (12) at its free end. This plate-shaped extension (12) encloses an angle ( alpha ) with the centre line of the braking arm and forms a gripper with a braking edge (13). In order to improve the mode of action of the braking arm, at least one moulding (14, 16), extending transversely and forming an additional braking edge (15, 17), is moulded onto the braking arm in front of the plate-shaped extension (12).

A brake arm for a ski brake comprising a shaped body 
(10) slipped over the free end of a wire, whose end 

pointing away from the wire ends in a plate-like 
extension (12) which is set at an angle α to the center 

line (20) of the brake arm and extends transversely 
thereto, and which constitutes a gripping means with a 

brake edge (13),
characterized in
 
that, at the shaped body (10) in the longitudinal 

direction of the center line (20) of the brake arm in 
front of its plate-like extensions (12) arranged at its 

end pointing away from the wire, at least one hook-like 
projection (14, 16) constituting an additional brake 

edge (15, 17) and being aligned transversely to the 
center line (20) of the brake am is formed, which, in a 

sectional plane extending through the center line (20) 
of the brake arm, has the configuration of a right 

angled triangle. 
The brake arm according to claim 1, characterized in 
that a plurality of hook-like projections (14, 16) are 

arranged one behind the other so that brake edges (15, 
17) are formed, which are arranged at different 

distances from the brake arm (10). 
The brake arm according to claim 1 or 2, characterized 
in that, starting from the plate-like extension (12) 

which forms a first brake edge (13), the distance of the  
 

brake edges (13, 15, 17) from the base surface (18) of 
the brake arm (10) decreases towards the hook-like 

projections (14, 16) which are further to the inside and 
which constitute further brake edges (15, 17). 
The brake arm according to any one of claims 1 through 
3, characterized in that the angle α between the 

plate-like extension (12) and the center line (20) of 
the brake arm (10) amounts to approximately 40° to 60°, 

preferably 45° to 55°. 
The brake arm according to any one of claims 1 through 
4, characterized in that between the plate-like 

extension (12) and the base surface (18) of the brake 
arm (10) a limiting wall (20) is provided at the side. 
The brake arm according to any one of claims 1 through 
5, characterized in that it is constituted by a metal 

wire or a metal tube, on whose end a shaped body (10) is 
slipped which is manufactured of injection moulded 

synthetic resin. 
The brake arm according to claim 1, characterized in 
that the hypotenuse of the triangle is a radius. 
The brake am according to any one of claims 1 through 
7, characterized in that at least one additional brake 

edge (15, 17) has an arcuate form.
