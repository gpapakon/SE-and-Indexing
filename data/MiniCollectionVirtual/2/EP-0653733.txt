<ABSTRACT>
The present invention relates to the dispensing system of a 
fried-egg slot machine. An egg is transferred from an egg 

dispenser to a receptor, where the egg is held by a suction plate, 
transferred to and transported by the conveyer, and then cracked 

by a cracker by sequential triggering signals. The cracked egg 
then breaks readily by the opening of the suction cone, and the 

fluid content drops to a fryer, which in turn cooks and dispenses 
the fried egg on a serving dish dropped from a dish dispenser. 

The egg shell held on the suction cone is removed by the egg 
conveyer.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to machines for dispensing and/or 
vending and, more particularily, to vending or dispensing machines 
which are capable of performing operations on the items to be 
dispensed, such as the cooking of an egg. Commercial vending machines have been available for fried 
eggs. All the currently available machines use a tong for holding 
and breaking an egg, and the egg held in a cup is then cooked in 
a microwave oven. This mechanism, however, has the following 
problems the egg shell tends to be mixed into the container cup 
together with the fluid content; the egg scrambled in the cup 
degrades the flavor; the remnant egg fluid stuck on the arms of the 
tong is vulnerable to bacteria; and the imprecise system operation 
often causes the machine breakdown. The purpose of the present invention is to solve such problems 
by adopting a new operational mechanism in which the bursting of  
 
the yolk of the egg is prevented by a sequential operation of air 
pressure and limit switch action. The egg on a carousel in the egg dispenser is dropped 
sequentially by a triggering signal to a receptor, transferred to and 
transported by the conveyer, and then cracked by the a cracker. 
The egg then breaks readily by the opening of the suction cone, 
and the fluid content drops to a fryer, which in turn cooks and 
places the fried egg on a serving dish dropped from a dish 
dispenser. The egg shell stuck on the suction cones is removed 
by the egg conveyer. When the main power is turned on, the following machine 
conditions are established. The connector arm of the egg receptor 
is lifted, and an egg is then dropped to the receptor plate from the 
carousel of the egg dispenser. The egg is securely placed on the 
vacuum suction plate, which is located at the center of the receptor 
plate. The suction unit of the egg conveyer is opened so that the 
egg receptor can be lowered. The egg cracker remains retreated, 
the fryer closed, and the frying pan kept at a constant temperature 
by the heater. The coin insertion and subsequent button selection 
will trigger the egg frying and dispensing operations. The above and other objects, features and other advantages of 
the present invention will be more clearly understood from the  
 
following detailed description taken in conjuction with the 
accompanying drawings, in which: 
Fig. 1 is a schematic diagram of the present invention; Fig. 2 is a perspective diagram of the egg receptor; Fig. 2A is a operation of the limit switch; Fig. 3 is a perspective

<CLAIMS>
The dispensing system of a fried egg vending machine 
consisting of: 

   an egg dispenser which dispenses egg sequentially through a 
jigged hole; 

   an egg receptor which holds the dispensed egg through a 
precision suction plate; 

   an egg conveyer which takes the egg from the receptor by 
fixing the egg onto its suction cone, transports it to the cracker, and 

breaks the cracked egg; 
   a egg fryer with an integrated scoop which cleans the frying 

pan and removes the fried egg; 
   an oil injector for a facile frying; 

   a dish dispenser with a spiral rotor; and 
   a liquid trap which traps the remnant egg fluid on the suction 

cone.
