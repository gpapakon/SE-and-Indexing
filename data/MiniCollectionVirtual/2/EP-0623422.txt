<ABSTRACT>
An electrical tool, in particular a hand grinder, is specified, having a motor-driven drive shaft (14) which can be coupled either via an oscillating drive to a tool drive shaft (12) or alternatively via a rotary drive to a tool receptacle (48) coaxial with the tool drive shaft (12). For switching over, use is made of a switching element (30) in whose first switching position (31) the drive shaft (14) is driven via the oscillating drive, which may consist, for example, of an eccentric element (28) on the tool drive shaft (14) and a pivoting element (66) sliding guided thereon and fixed on the tool drive shaft (12), in oscillatory fashion at a small pivoting angle and high frequency about the longitudinal axis (13) of the tool drive shaft (12). In the second switching position (32) of the switching element, on the other hand, the operative connection of the oscillating drive is broken and the tool receptacle (48) is driven in rotary fashion by the drive shaft (14) via a bevel gearing (24, 26).

oscillating manner about a pivot axis, characterized in 

that a rotary drive (24, 26) is provided by means of which 
the drive shaft (14) can be coupled to the tool (62, 64) 

in such a way that the tool (62, 64) is rotationally driven, 
in that a switching element (30) with at least two switch 

positions (31, 32), which interacts with the oscillation 
drive and the rotary drive, is provided, that in a first 

switch position (31) of the switching element (30), the 
oscillation drive is coupled to the tool (62, 64) to provide 

oscillating drive for the tool (62, 64) about a pivot axis, 
and in that in a second switch position (32) of the 

switching element (30), the rotary drive is coupled to 
the tool (62, 64) to provide rotational drive for the tool 

(62, 64). 
Power tool according to Claim 1, characterized in that 
in the first switch position (31), the drive shaft (14) 

is coupled to the tool drive shaft (12) via the oscillation 
drive to drive the tool in an oscillating manner, and in 

that in the second switch position (32), the drive shaft 
(14) is coupled, via the rotary drive (24, 26), to a tool 

receptacle (48) to drive the tool rotationally. 
Power tool according to Claim 1 or 2, characterized in 
that the tool drive shaft (12) is oriented perpendicular  

 
to the drive shaft (14), in that the oscillation drive 

comprises an eccentric element (28) attached non-rotatably 
to the drive shaft (14) and a pivot element (66) attached 

non-rotatably to the tool drive shaft (12) and in that 
in the first switch position (31) of the switching element 

(30), the pivot element (66) is driven by the eccentric 
element (28) in such a way that the tool drive shaft (12) 

is moved in an oscillating manner about its pivot axis, 
at high frequency and with a small pivot angle. 
Power tool according to Claim 1, 2, or 3, characterized 
in that a drive pinion (24) is attached non-rotatably to 

the drive shaft (14) and an output gear (26) is attached 
non-rotatably to the tool receptacle (48), and in that 

in the second switch position (32) of the switching element 
(30), the drive pinion (24) meshes with the output gear 

(26) in order to drive the tool receptacle (48) rotationally 
about its longitudinal axis (13), while the pivot element 

(66) is not in working engagement with the eccentric element 
(28) of the drive shaft (14). 
Power tool according to any one of the foregoing Claims, 
characterized in that the tool receptacle (48) is configured 

coaxially with the tool drive shaft (12), and mounted 
rotatably with respect thereto. 
Power tool according to Claim 4 or 5, characterized in 
that the tool receptacle (48) is non-rotatably attached 

to the output gear (26) by means of a hollow shaft (50) 
rotatably mounted on the tool drive shaft (12).  

 
Power tool according to one or more of the foregoing Claims, 
characterized in that the tool receptacle (48) carries 

a mount (56), offset from the longitudinal axis (13) of 
the tool drive shaft (12), to receive the tool (62), so 

as to drive the tool (62) in eccentric rotation about the 
longitudinal axis (13) in the second switch position of 

the switching element (30). 
Power tool according to one or more of the foregoing Claims, 
characterized in that the tool drive shaft (12) carries 

a central mount (58), coaxial with the longitudinal axis
