PHARMACEUTICAL COMPOSITIONS CONTAINING MONOSIALOGANGLIOSIDEDERIVATIVES SUITABLE FOR THE TREATMENT OF SPINAL CORD INJURYTechnical FieldThe present invention relates to pharmaceutical compositions containing monosialoganglioside derivatives suitable for the treatment of spinal cord injury.Background artSpinal cord injury induced by ischaemic or traumatic causes is a sudden catastrophic event producing devastating effects on people and, furthermore, a considerable socio-economic impact.The incidence of said injury is high: for example, in the USA over10,000 people/year sustain spinal cord injury resulting in permanent disablement. Many suffer immediate paralysis and progressive worsening of the medullary pathology. Partial injury may result in temporary paralysis.Spinal cord injury may be defined as primary or secondary.Primary injury arises from tissue destruction by mechanical or ischaemic causes (occurring in the lapse of time between lesion and hospitalization) and involves a practically irreversible neurologic deficit. At the present time there is no possibility of effectively acting on injuries of this type.The secondary injury seems to be the result of the combined action of delayed swelling, additional injuries to the already affected spinal segment, anoxia, reduced perfusion to the impaired medulla tract and/or release of endogenous factors. 

The investigations carried out so far have pinpointed some molecular bases of spinal injury and recovery, i.e.: a) "neuronal elements injury": as known, secondary injury at least in part results from hypoxic-ischaemic processes damaging neuronal and axonal elements. It is to be stressed that spinal cord traumatic injury seldom causes spinal cord anatomic transection, even in case of total loss of the neurologic clinical function at the caudal portion level. The neurologic deficit is actually induced by a microscopic physical decay of the axons crossing the injury site, by ischaemia or hypoxia followed by local infarction, or by microhaemorrhages or oedema inside the spinal cord at the injury site,- which also affect neuronal impulses transmission; b) "substantia alba tracts injury": as known, clinical deficit after spinal cord injury results also from disorders to the substantia alba, including spinal cord ascending and descending tracts; c) "neurotrophic agents": as known, soluble trophic agents are released by glial cells and improve the survival, the spinal neurons morphofunctional properties and the axonal regeneration; d) "microenvironmental
