<ABSTRACT>
Method for transmitting control systems for an electronic control system (1) of an internal-combustion engine, characterised in that the signal TDC representing the passage of a reference cylinder through the top dead centre is transmitted for the attention of receiver systems via an output (2) which is also associated with the transmission of a control signal intended for a relay (4) used for controlling a member (3) of the engine, the said member remaining activated throughout the time of operation of the engine.

<CLAIMS>
Process for transmission of command signals for an electronic control 
system (1) for an internal combustion engine, characterised in that the 

TDC signal representing the passage to the top dead centre of a reference 
cylinder is transmitted for the attention of receptor systems by means of 

an output (2) furthermore associated with the transmission of a command 
signal intended for a relay (4) which monitors a member (3) of the 

engine, said member remaining activated throughout the time the engine 
is operating. 
Process of transmission of signals according to claim 1, characterised in 
that the TDC signal is defined by pulses of a pre-determined duration. 
Process of transmission of signals according to claim 2, characterised in 
that the duration of said
 pulses is defined so as to simultaneously permit 
recognition thereof by said receptor systems and the non-activation of 

said relay (4). 
Process of transmission of signals according to any one of the preceding 
claims, characterised in that said member is the engine fuel pump.
