<DESCRIPTION>
PREPARATION OF A HIGH SURFACE AREA GAMMA LITHIUM ALUMINATEThe present invention concerns the preparation of a high surface area predominantly single phase gamma lithium aluminate by contacting hydrogen peroxide with a low surface area gamma lithium aluminate obtained from a lithium salt and an aluminum source.Gamma-lithium aluminate is the candidate support material for the carbonate electrolyte in molten car¬ bonate fuel cells. This support material is processed into a porous tile of about one square meter in area and from 0.5-2 mm thick by tape casting. Lithium aluminate is inert under the corrosive conditions of the molten carbonate fuel cell and at the operating temperature of around 650*C. However, lithium alumi¬ nate has three phases, namely: a, β, 7. The presence of a mixture of phases can cause premature cracking of the tile and loss of electrolyte. Of these phases, the most stable is the 7 phase. A pure gamma phase lithium aluminate allows a lifetime of the tiles of as much as 40,000 hours.To serve as an electrolyte holding material,L1AIO2 must exist mainly in the gamma phase with a surface area greater than 10 m2/g, and with minimum presence of the alpha or beta phases. Both the α and the β phase convert to the 7 phase at temperatures greater than 700*C. Unfortunately, an increase in the calcination temperature brings about a decrease in the surface area of lithium aluminate to as low as 1 m /g. Attempts to produce high surface area 7-lithium aluminate have been reported in the literature.One procedure developed to prepare a high surface area gamma lithium aluminate is the sol-gel route which is basically hydrolysis of the metal alkoxides to small particle, solid powders, followed by 

 calcination at elevated temperatures. Two European patents that report this method are EP 207,663 and EP 235,098 wherein surface areas of 30-40 m2/g -were obtained. Disadvantages of this process are the need for an inert atmosphere, the number of processing steps, and the length of time for completion of the process. Commercialization of this process will be complicated, labor intensive, and expensive.Another mode of preparation for a high surface area 7-lithium aluminate is by contacting lithium aluminate with water alone or in the presence of water and an organic solvent with one or more hydroxyl groups as described in EP 336,322. In this patent, one hundred grams of 7-LiA102 with initial surface area of 22 m2/g is contacted with 350 grams of distil¬ led water for 31.25 days at room temperature. The resulting

STATEMENT UNDER ARTICLE 19
The applicant has reviewed the international search report and wishes to amend the claims and description of the above identified PCT application and to comment on the references cited in the International Search Report.,
The Applicant requests the claims and specification be amended to contain the amendment made in the corresponding U.S.A. application in response to a request for clarifying amendments by the U.S. Examiner. Thus, the Applicant requests amendments of the claims include the modifying term "BET" before each appearance of "surface area". It can be seen from page 6 line 36 that only BET surface areas were measured.
Claim 8 has been amended at page 13 line 8 to change 10 m
2
/g to 20 m
2
/g to make the preamble to the claim consistent with the product produced as set orth in the last line of claim 8, namely 20 m
2
/g. The number 1.2 appearing in claim 8 at page 13 line 11 is a typographical error as can be seen from claim 1 at page
12 line 7 and the description at page 6 line line 2 where 1/2 hour and 30 minutes are mentioned. The words "greater than" in claim 8 at page 13 line 14 does not have a basis in the description so "greater than" has been replaced by "in the range of" which comes from the description at page 10 line 12.
