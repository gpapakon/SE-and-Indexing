<ABSTRACT>
The invention provides a method of preconditioning 
selected species of fish to associate characteristic acoustic 

signals with food, thereby to induce the fish to congregate 
towards a selected location in response to such acoustic 

signals.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates generally to the 
conditioning of fish to respond to acoustic signals in a 
desired manner, and to a method of stimulating a feeding 
response in fish by means of underwater acoustic signals. 
The method is applicable both to aquaculture and to the 
harvesting of fish. The present invention, according to one of its 
aspects, relates to a method of enhancing the growth rates of 
juvenile fish, including larval fish, in an aquatic 
environment wherein the juvenile fish are nurtured prior to 
being released to the wild. It is well known that the encroachment of industrial 
expansion upon the wilderness is detrimental to the wild 
environment, resulting in depletion of various animal, bird 
and fish populations. Such encroachment has become a matter 
of great environmental concern and various steps have been 
taken to examine the problem and, where possible, to protect 
or replace diminished species. In the case of fish population losses, more 
particularly in fresh water environments, aquaculture 
provides an option for the replacement of species at a 
specific location, as well as a method to preserve 
biodiversity within an affected watershed. However, existing 
aquacultural approaches to the problem of nurturing juvenile 
and larval fish to be released subsequently to the 
environment call for continuous maintenance and care, 
including density reductions, of the fish. The existing 
approaches are highly labour intensive and costly, and 
therefore generally unacceptable.  
 The present invention makes use of acoustics both to attract 
the fish to a feeding station and to precondition the fish to 
respond to a selected acoustic signal. It is well known, of course, that acoustic signals can be 
used to direct the movements of fish. EP 533029 discloses a 
process and an apparatus for catching fish-by the use of an 
acoustic signal which attracts the fish into a trap. The trap 
is associated with a food container serving as bait to which the 
fish are attracted when a signal to which they have become 
accustomed is applied. U.S. Patent No. 4,922,468 relates to a 
method and apparatus for controlling aquatic population in 
defined areas, more particularly for steering fish away from 
danger areas by applying an acoustic signal which, as a 
repellant, will steer the fish away from a danger area or, as an 
attractant, will steer the fish towards a safer area. The 
apparatus can be adjusted to produce the acoustic signal that is 
observed to be most effective. These are examples of

<CLAIMS>
A method of enhancing the survival or growth rates or both of fish (11) in 
an aquatic environment (10), in which an acoustic projector is utilized (14) to 

stimulate a response in the fish, whereby the or each fish (11) is preconditioned 
to respond to an acoustic signal; a feeder (12) is provided at a selected location 

for periodically dispensing food to the aquatic environment (10); and an acoustic 
signal, to which the fish (11) has been preconditioned to respond, is generated at 

times coordinated with the times at which food is dispensed; characterised in that 
the acoustic projector (14) is actuated to generate an acoustic signal at a 

selected predominant frequency within the range 10 Hz - 4 kHz, whereby said 
selected predominant frequency is ascertained by 


(I) periodically dispensing food at a particular location in a first captive aquatic 
environment; 
(II) transmitting acoustic signals through the aquatic environment (21) at times 
coordinated with the times at which food is dispensed, and at a first frequency 

within said range 10 Hz - 4 kHz; 
(III) monitoring the response of a fish sample to said first frequency by observing 
fish movement towards said particular location during the transmission times; 
(IV) duplicating steps (I) (II) and (III) for like fish samples in respective captive 
aquatic environments (22-23) at different acoustic frequencies within said range 

of 10 Hz - 4 kHz, and 
(V) selecting the frequency at which the monitored response is greatest. 
A method according to Claim l, characterized in that the step of 
preconditioning the fish (11) comprises periodically dispensing food at a selected 

location in a captive aquatic environment (21) and, at times at which the food is  
 

dispensed, transmitting an acoustic signal at said selected frequency through the 
aquatic environment whereby to stimulate a feeding response. 
A method according to Claim l or 2, characterized in that the duration of 
said acoustic signal exceeds one second. 
A method according to Claim l, 2 or 3, wherein the fish (11) are of the non-ostiophysine 
group and said selected frequency is in the range 50 Hz - 1000 Hz. 
A method of inducing fish (11) to congregate towards a selected location of 
an aquatic environment by stimulating a feeding response, thereby to facilitate 

harvesting of the fish, comprising the provision of an acoustic generator (14) at 
said selected location for generating an acoustic signal to which the fish has 

been preconditioned to respond; characterised in that the acoustic projector (14) 
is actuated to generate an acoustic signal at a selected predominant frequency 

within the range 10 Hz - 4 kHz, whereby said selected predominant frequency is 
ascertained by 


(I) periodically dispensing food at a particular location in a first captive 
aquatic environment; 
(II) transmitting acoustic signals through the aquatic environment (21) at 
times coordinated with the times at which food is dispensed, and at a 

first frequency within said range 10 Hz -4 kHz; 
(III) monitoring the response of a fish sample to said first frequency by 
observing fish movement towards said particular location during the 

transmission times; 
(IV) duplicating steps (I) (II) and (III) for like fish samples in respective 
captive aquatic environments (22-23) at different acoustic 

frequencies within said range of 10 Hzx - 4 kHz, and 
(V) selecting the frequency at which the monitored response is greatest.
