<ABSTRACT>
In an injection mold having a cavity formed 
between opposing faces of a fixed mold (1) and a movable 

mold (21) for defining a shape of a product, and cooling 
channels formed in the fixed mold (1) and the movable mold (21), 

respectively, for cooling resins injected into the 
cavity, cooling channels (24-27) of the movable mold (21) are formed 

at positions at least opposite to those where cooling 
channels (7-9) of the fixed mold (1) are not formed, thereby 

obtaining an injection mold capable of securing 
uniformity of optical properties of the obtained molded 

article, such as birefringence and causing no 
deterioration of mechanical properties of the molded 

article such as a deflection even when a cooling time is 
shortened in order to increase cycle of the injection 

molding.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates generally to an
injection mold, and more particularly, to an injection
mold suitably used for molding a flat plate-shaped
product having a large project area such as a substrate
for an optical disc.As is generally known, in an injection molding
of various resins, it is necessary to cool and solidify
resins, which are melted in a heating cylinder and
injected into a cavity, in the cavity and to take out
the resins from the cavity. For this purpose, cooling
channels for cooling and solidifying the resins in the
cavity are conventionally formed in a fixed mold and a
movable mold, respectively.Figs. 4 and 5 show the molds among the
conventional injection molds for molding a compact disc
(a substrate for an optical disc).Fig. 4 shows an arrangement of cooling
channels 3 viewed from a mirror surface 2 defining a
cavity of a fixed mold 1, and Fig. 5 shows an
arrangement of cooling channels 6 viewed from a mirror
surface 5 of a movable mold 4. In these figures, the cooling channels 3 and 6
are formed of a plurality of cooling channels (three
cooling channels in these figures) 7, 8, and 9 extending
to circumferential directions and the cooling channels
10 radially communicating these cooling channels 7, 8,
and 9. The cooling channels 7, 8, and 9 extending to
circumferential directions are formed at equal intervals
in the radial directions from the respective centers.
Accordingly, when the movable mold 4 is superimposed on
the fixed mold 1, these cooling channels 7, 8, and 9
formed in both fixed and movable molds 1 and 4 are
arranged so that they completely correspond to each
other in the radial directions of the cavity.In the conventional injection mold as
described above, the cooling channels 7, 8, and 9 of the
movable mold 4 and the fixed mold 1 are arranged so that
they completely correspond to each other in a radial
directions of the cavity. Thus, when a compact disc is
molded by these fixed and movable molds 1 and 4, a
cooling rate at the positions where the cooling channels
7, 8, and 9 are not formed is inferior to that at the
positions where the cooling channels 7, 8, and 9 are
formed.Thus, the conventional injection mold has the
following problems.When a cooling time is shortened at a request
of increasing a cycle of injection molding, optical 
properties such as birefringence of the obtained optical
disc becomes uneven due to a difference of the cooling
rate of the resins in the cavity 2 between the sites
where the cooling channels 7, 8, and 9 are formed and
those where
