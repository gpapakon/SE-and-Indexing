<ABSTRACT>
A rotary head type magnetic recording and 
reproducing apparatus for recording and reproducing an 

analog wide-band video signal, audio signal and 
compressed digital signal on the same recording medium. 

The modulated analog wide-band video signal or the 
narrow-band-converted compressed digital signal is 

recorded on two video tracks adjacent to each other on a 
magnetic tape (301) by magnetic heads (301a, 301b and 

302a, 302b) on a rotary drum (300). In another arrangement 
in which the audio signals multiplexed in frequency 

are recorded on the audio track adjacent to the video 
tracks on the magnetic tape (310) by the magnetic heads 

(303a, 303b) and the decision circuit (264), by utilizing 
the signal reproduced from the audio track, determines 

whether the signal recorded on the video tracks is analog 
or digital, the input analog wide-band video signal is 

divided into signals of two channels by the recording-system 
analog signal processing circuit (57), those 

signals are recorded on the magnetic tape (60) in multi-track 
recording by a pair of magnetic heads (62a, 62b) 

and another pair of magnetic heads (62, 62d), the input 
audio signals are modulated by the FM modulator (15) and 

the QPSK modulator (16), and recorded in a deep-layer 
portion of another track between the video tracks. A 

compressed digital digital signal received by the antenna 
(1) is added with error correction codes by the 

recording-system digital signal processing circuit (5),  
 

and is modulated by the 16QAM modulator (6) so that the 
spectral components of the compressed digital signal does 

not enter the audio signal frequency band, and is 
recorded on said audio track superposed but in a deeper-layer 

portion of the tape by yet another pair of magnetic 
heads (64a, 64b).

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a rotary head type 
magnetic recording and reproducing apparatus for 
recording and reproducing video and audio signals, and 
particularly to a rotary head type magnetic recording and 
reproducing apparatus for recording and reproducing a 
wide-band video signal or a highly-efficicent-encoded 
compressed digital signal. As household video and audio signal recording 
and reproducing apparatuses, analog VTR's of VHS HiFi and 
S-VHS systems have been in wide use. With regard to the 
video signal, the luminance signal, which has been 
frequency-modulated, and the carrier chrominance signal, 
which has been converted to a low frequency band, are 
multiplexed in frequency division, and the multiplexed 
signal is recorded or reproduced on the tracks formed in 
the oblique direction on a magnetic tape with rotary 
heads for the video signal. In high-speed reproduction, 
however, with the tape running at high speed, the rotary 
heads for video signal reproduce several tracks together 
in such a manner that the rotary heads sweep them 
transversely. In recording the audio signals, the 
frequency-modulated audio signals of the L- and R-channels 
are recorded on the same tracks as the video 
signal, but the audio signals are recorded into the  
 
deeper-layer portion of the tape and reproduced therefrom 
by the audio signal heads having an azimuth angle different 
from that of the rotary heads for the video signal. 
Moreover, an audio signal of PCM channel provided as an 
optional function is QPSK-modulated and then multiplexed 
in frequency division with the audio signals of the L-and 
R-channels, which have been frequency-modulated, and 
the multiplexed audio signal is recorded on the same 
tracks as the video signal but into the deeper-level 
portion of the tape and reproduced therefrom by the 
rotary heads for the audio signal. Meanwhile, progress has been made toward the 
practical application of analog wide-band video signals 
in realizing higher resolution than that of the current 
analog video signals of NTSC, PAL or the like. Let us 
compare the main parameters between the current analog 
video signals of NTSC system or the like and the analog 
wide-band video signal. The number of scanning lines is 
525 for the former and 1125 for the latter, the aspect 
ratio is 4 : 3 for the former and 16 : 9 for the latter, 
and the frequency band of the luminance signal is 4.2 MHz 
for the former and 20 MHz for the latter. Efforts have been directed toward the practical 
application of
