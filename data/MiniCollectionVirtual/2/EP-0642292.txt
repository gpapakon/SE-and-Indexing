<ABSTRACT>
In a device for stereophonic reproduction in a closed space, preferably in a motor vehicle, having a number of loudspeakers and at least one listening location which can be located at different distances from the loudspeakers, audio signals provided for reproduction with the aid of the individual loudspeakers pass through delay devices, the delay time of which is adjustable. Means for measuring the sound propagation times from the individual loudspeakers to the listening location are provided, the delay times being automatically adjustable in such a manner that the sum of the sound propagation time and the delay time set in each case is identical for all loudspeakers.

Device for stereophonic reproduction in an
enclosed space, preferably in a motor vehicle, having a

plurality of loudspeakers and at least one listening
location which may be at various distances from the

loudspeakers, audio signals which are provided for
reproduction using the individual loudspeakers (25, 26,

27, 28) passing through delay devices (10, 11, 12, 13)
whose delay time is settable, characterized in that

means (5, 29, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35) are provided for
measuring the sound propagation times from the

individual loudspeakers (25, 26, 27, 28) to the
listening location, and in that the delay times can be

set automatically such that the sum of the sound
propagation time and the delay time set in each case is

the same for all loudspeakers (25, 26, 27, 28).
Device according to Claim 1, characterized in
that means (5, 29, 31, 37) are additionally provided

for measuring the sound levels produced at the
listening location by the individual loudspeakers (25,

26, 27, 28) as a result of reproduction of a measured
signal, preferably a noise signal, and in that the

volume of the individual loudspeakers (25, 26, 27, 28)
can be automatically preset for the purpose of

compensating for level differences.
Device according to one of Claims 1 and 2,
characterized in that the delay times set, and possibly

presets for the volume, can be stored on a non-volatile
basis for a plurality of listening locations. 
Device according to Claim 3, characterized in
that information about which of the stored delay times,

and possibly of the stored presets for the volume, are
supplied to the delay devices (10, 11, 12, 13) when the

device is turned on can likewise be stored on a non-volatile
basis.
Device according to one of the preceding
claims, characterized in that the delay devices (10,

11, 12, 13) are formed by digital memories from which
the respective audio signals to be delayed are read

with a time delay with respect to writing.
Device according to Claim 5, characterized in
that the digital memories are parts of a digital audio

signal processing device, in that the device is
suitable for selecting, once the sound propagation

times (T
x
) have been measured for all the loudspeakers,
the maximum sound propagation time (T
max
) from said
sound propagation times (T
x
) and calculating the
individual delay times in accordance with Ta
x
 = (T
max
 -
T
x
)Â·k, where Ta denotes the delay time to be set in
sampling cycles of the digital audio signal processing

device, x denotes the respective loudspeaker and k
denotes the ratio between the processor cycle duration

in which the sound propagation times T
x
 and T
max
 were
measured and the sampling cycle duration.
Device according to one of the preceding
claims, characterized in that it is suitable, for the

purpose of measuring the sound propagation time, for
successively supplying a pulsed signal to a respective

loudspeaker and at the same time starting a chronometer
(33) which measures the time until the sound level

exceeds a prescribed threshold value at a measurement
microphone (29).
Device according to Claim 7, characterized in
that the pulsed signal is produced by a square-wave

pulse having a length of at least 3 ms.
Device according to one of Claims 7 and 8,
characterized in that it is suitable for supplying the

pulsed signal to the loudspeaker (25, 26, 27, 28) via a 
low-pass filter (35), preferably of third order with a

cut-off frequency of 11 kHz.
Device according to one of the preceding
claims, characterized in that the audio signals

additionally pass through frequency response equalizer
circuits, in that means are provided for measuring the

frequency response between the loudspeakers and a
measurement microphone, and in that the frequency

response equalizers can be set on the basis of the
results of the measurement, the respectively set

frequency responses of the individual loudspeakers
being capable of being stored for various listening

locations.
