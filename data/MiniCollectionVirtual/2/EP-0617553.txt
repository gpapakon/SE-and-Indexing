<ABSTRACT>
In an imaging apparatus with rotary table 
having a plurality of control items, operation completion 

of control items, such as horizontal angle, 
vertical angle, zoom and focus, of the imaging apparatus 

and the rotary table is detected by respective completion 
detectors (17, 27) and so on. On the basis of the 

logical product of all operation completion signals, an 

AND circuit 3 permits control toward the next desired 
value.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an imaging
apparatus having a rotary table to be used for
monitoring and recording.Fig. 9 is a block diagram showing the
configuration of a conventional imaging apparatus. With
reference to Fig. 9, n combinations of desired position
data with respect to control items of four kinds 1(n) to
4(n) are stored in a preset unit 2. One arbitrary
combination is selected according to an input supplied
from a controller 41. A comparator 13 is supplied with
selected desired position data of 1(n), such as 1(2).
Its output is inputted to a horizontal-angle control
motor 15 via a driving amplifier 14. Turning force of
the motor 15 drives horizontal rotation of a rotary
table via a reduction gear or the like. The horizontal
angle of the rotary table is detected by a position
sensor 16 and inputted to the comparator 13. A
comparator 23 is supplied with desired position data,
such as 2(2), of the preset unit 2. A vertical-angle
control motor 25 drives vertical rotation of the rotary
table. In addition, a series of operations of a driving
amplifier 24, the motor 25, and a position sensor 26 are
the same as those of the driving amplifier 14, the motor
15, and the position sensor 16. In completely the same 
way, numerals 33 and 43 denote comparators. The
comparators 33 and 43 are supplied with desired position
data 3(2) and 4(2), respectively. Numerals 34 and 44
denote driving amplifiers, and numerals 35 and 45 denote
zoom-control motor and focus-control motor. The driving
amplifier 34 and the motor 35 drive the zoom, whereas
the driving amplifier 35 and the motor 45 drive the
focus. Numerals 36 and 46 denote position sensors.Operation of the conventional imaging
apparatus having the above described configuration will
now be described. Among one set of data selected by a
movement instruction, desired position data of
horizontal angle 1(2), desired position data of vertical
angle 2(2), desired position data of zoom 3(2), and
desired position data of focus 4(2) are inputted to the
comparators 13, 23, 33 and 43, respectively. In the
comparator 13, the desired position data 1(2) supplied
from the preset unit 2 is compared with the output of
the position sensor 16. An output proportionate to the
difference between them is amplified by the driving
amplifier 14. The amplied output is supplied to the
motor 15. The angle of the rotary table rotated
horizontally by the rotation output of the motor 15 is
converted into an electric signal by the position sensor
16. The electric signal is fed back to the
