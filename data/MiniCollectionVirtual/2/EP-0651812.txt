<ABSTRACT>
A modular promoter construct contains a promoter active in vegetable cells and a DNA sequence from the exon 1 of the rice actin 1 gene. This modular promoter construct allows a considerable increase of gene expression in vegetable cells, if required with other regulatory DNA sequences.

<CLAIMS>
Modular promoter construct, which has a
promoter which is active in plant cells and a DNA

sequence from exon 1 of the rice actin 1 gene, and the
alleles and gene expression-stimulating derivatives of

this modular promoter construct, with the proviso that
the promoter is not a promoter of the rice actin 1

gene.
Promoter construct according to Claim 1,
characterized in that the DNA sequence conforms to

positions +4 to +57 in exon 1 of the actin 1 gene.
Promoter construct according to Claim 1
or 2, characterized in that it also contains a DNA

sequence from intron 1 of the maize sucrose synthase
gene.
Promoter construct according to Claim 3,
characterized in that it additionally contains an 18-bp

OTF binding site.
Vector, containing a promoter construct
according to one of Claims 1 to 4, which is coupled to

a gene which is to be expressed in a plant cell.
Plant cell which is transformed with a
vector according to Claim 5.
Use of the promoter construct according
to one of Claims 1 to 4 for preparing plants having

elevated gene expression.
Use of a plant cell according to Claim 6
for generating a plant.
