<ABSTRACT>
A tape cassette attachment device in a cassette tape recorder 
includes a cassette holder (35) into which is inserted and held a tape 

cassette (1) having a closure plate (14) mounted on a bottom surface of 
the tape cassette (1) for movement between a position covering reel 

drive shaft insertion openings (12, 13) formed in the bottom surface of 
the tape cassette (1) and a position uncovering the reel drive shaft 

insertion openings (12, 13). The cassette holder (35) is shifted 
horizontally and vertically so as to position the tape cassette (1) at 

a predetermined tape cassette attachment position in the recorder. The 
tape cassette (1) is designed so as to enable the shifting operation of 

the cassette holder (35) to effect tape cassette attachment only when 
the tape cassette (1) is correctly inserted and held with respect to 

the cassette holder (35).

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a tape cassette attachment device in 
combination with a tape cassette suitable for use in magnetic 
recording/reproducing apparatus such as a cassette- type tape recorder 
in which a cassette holder is provided into which the tape cassette is 
inserted. In the case of a digital audio tape (DAT) recorder, including a 
rotary magnetic head device, the tape cassette used in the DAT recorder 
has a structure capable of completely sealing and thus protecting the 
magnetic tape during non-use, that is when the tape cassette is not 
inserted in the recorder. The front or tape extracting side of the 
tape cassette includes a front cover that may be pivoted to open or 
close the front side, while its bottom side is covered by a closure 
plate that may be slid to open or close the reel drive shaft insertion 
openings. In magnetic recording/reproducing apparatus such as the DAT 
recorder described above, in order for the tape cassette to be inserted 
in the recorder and engaged with the reel drive shafts, it is necessary 
initially for the closure plate to be shifted to its open position so 
as to open the reel drive shaft inserting openings before the tape 
cassette can be fully inserted and engaged in the tape cassette 
attachment position. It is known for DAT recorders to be provided with a tape cassette 
attachment device such that the tape cassette is attached at its 
predetermined tape cassette attachment position as the closure plate is 
shifted to open the reel drive shaft insertion openings. The 
applicants have proposed this type of tape cassette attachment device 
in Japanese Unexamined Patent Publication No. 61-283 060/1986 and 
Japanese Unexamined Utility Model Publication No. 62-147 156/1987. In 
the tape cassette attachment device disclosed therein, the cassette 
holder in which the tape cassette is inserted and held is provided with 
means for opening or closing the closure plate which is shifted to its 
open position as the cassette holder is fed towards the main body of 
the apparatus, thereby opening the reel drive shaft insertion openings. 
However, it is necessary, after the closure plate has been shifted to 
open the reel drive shaft insertion openings and the tape reel in the  
 
tape cassette has been enabled to engage with the reel drive shafts of 
the recording/reproducing apparatus, for the cassette holder holding 
the tape cassette to be then moved towards and into the tape cassette 
attachment position. According to the invention there is provided a tape

<CLAIMS>
A tape cassette attachment device in combination with a tape 
cassette (1) and comprising:
 
   a cassette holder (35) to retain the tape cassette (1), which 

tape cassette (1) rotatably accommodates a pair of tape reels (5, 6) 
having a magnetic tape (7) wound thereon and has a closure plate (14), 

movable between a closed position covering a pair of reel drive shaft 
insertion openings (12, 13) formed at least in the bottom surface of 

the tape cassette (1) and an open position uncovering the reel drive 
shaft insertion openings (12, 13), mounted on the outer bottom surface 

of the tape cassette (1), and a pivotable lid (10) provided to open or 
close an aperture (19) in the front of the tape cassette (1), the 

cassette holder (35) including control projection means (66) on a 
bottom plate (60) thereof, the control projection means (66) 

controlling movement of the closure plate (14) in opposition to 
insertion movement of the tape cassette (1) and shifting the closure 

plate (14) from the closed position to the open position when the tape 
cassette (1) is inserted;
 
   a slide guide frame (40) to support the cassette holder (35) for 

vertical movement and being supported for reciprocation with respect to 
a chassis (36), the slide guide frame (40) being reciprocatable between 

a first position in which the tape cassette (1) may be inserted into or 
detached from the cassette holder (35) and a second position in which 

the tape reels (5, 6) of the tape cassette (1) are in register with 
reel drive shafts (38, 39) on the chassis (36), the cassette holder 

(35) being vertically shifted between the first position and the second 
position;
 
   locking and holding means (133, 134) to lock and hold the slide 

guide frame (40) at the first position with respect to the chassis (36) 
to inhibit shifting of the slide guide frame (40); and
 
   sensing means (131, 132) to sense tape cassette insertion and 

being operable to sense that the tape cassette (1) has been inserted to 
a determined
 position in the cassette holder (35), thereby releasing 
locking of the locking and holding means (133, 134);
 
   characterised in that the sensing means (131, 132) to sense tape 

cassette insertion comprises a mating thrust section (132) provided at  
 

a position more inward in the apparatus than the position at which the 
control projection means (66) of the cassette holder (35) are provided, 

such that only when the closure plate (14) has been shifted so that the 
reel drive shaft insertion openings (12, 13) are opened completely can 

the tape cassette (1) abut the mating thrust section (132) to release 
the locking of the locking and holding means (133, 134). 
A tape cassette attachment device according to claim 1, wherein 
the sensing means (131, 132) to sense tape cassette insertion comprises 

a tape cassette insertion sensor member (131) movably mounted to the 
slide guide frame (40), the sensor member (131) including the mating 

thrust section (132) to be thrust and controlled by the tape cassette 
(1), and the locking and holding means comprises a locking member (134) 

engageable with a locking section (133) provided on a support side 
plate (77) on the chassis (36) movably supporting the slide guide frame 

(40). 
A tape attachment device according to claim 1 or claim 2, wherein 
the cassette holder (35) includes engaging thrust support means (72) on 

an upper surface thereof, the engaging thrust support means (72) being 
engageable in a rectangular engagement recess (32) on an upper surface 

of the tape cassette (1) upon insertion of the tape cassette (1), the 
tape cassette insertion sensing means (131, 132) being positioned so as 

to be thrust and controlled by the tape cassette (1) only after the 
tape cassette (1) has been inserted into the cassette holder (35) and 

the engagement recess (32) has been completely engaged by the engaging 
thrust support means (72).
