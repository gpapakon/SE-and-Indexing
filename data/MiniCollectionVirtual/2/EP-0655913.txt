<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to novel titanocene derivatives possessing chemotherapeutic activity and method for their preparation. These compounds possess two cyclopentadiene rings linked to titanium as a central atom and bound covalently to two phenoxy groups which possess a substituent R selected from the group consisting of: COOCH3, COOC2H5, H, COOCH2CH2OCH2CH2OCH3 and are free from amino groups, nitro, chloride and fluoride. The novel compounds represent a compromise between the main properties for an antitumor agent, i.e. electrophilicity and stability, being water soluble. Cytotoxicity measurements of these compounds showed significant growth inhibition properties, expressed in terms of IC50(M) values.

<DESCRIPTION>
 NOVEL METALLOCENES AS ANTI-TUMOR DRUGSThe present invention relates to new titanocene com¬ pounds. More particularly the invention relates to new titanocene complexes and methods for their preparation, which possess chemotherapeutic activity being useful for the treatment of human tumors.BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION There are known metallocene complexes containing titan¬ ium, vanadium, niobium and molibdenum as a metal ion, which are active against a variety of tumor cell lines such as B16 melanoma, colon 38 carcinoma, Lewis lung car¬ cinoma, etc. It has been shown that the activity of vana¬ dium complexes related to the formula Cp2VC12 where C is cyclopentadiene, against human epidermoid (HEP-2) tumor cells in vitro and against mouse tumor cells, is similar to that of cis-platin (Murthy M.S. et al. Proc .Am. Assoc. Cancer Res. 1986, 27, 279). A study which was carried out with a corresponding molibdenum compound, supports the possibility that these complexes are binding 5'-phosphate terminated polynucleotides , thus inhibiting DNA replication, by a mechanism which is different from that of cis-platinum complexes (Kon.L.Y. et al. J.A . Chem.Soc. 1991, 113, 9027).Titanocene dichloride, one of the first metallocene compounds which was tested, was found to be indeed a very reactive anti-tumor reagent. Due to its rapid hydrolysis 

to the corresponding dihydroxy derivative, it is quite reasonable to assume that this dihydroxy titanocene is the actual drug. Accordingly, many references can be found describing titanocene compounds which were tested in an attempt to possess an improved cytotoxity. Examples of such compounds include halides, pseudohal ides , carbo- xylates, and phenolates. However, no significant improve¬ ment over titanocene dichloride in the antitumor activity has been achieved. The metallocene diacido complexes, having the general formula (C5H5)2MX2 are characterized by the following structural features:- The geometry of the complexes is that of a distorted tetrahedron . - The complexes contain two uninegative acido ligands X coordinated to the central metal atom and arranged in adjacent "cis-like" position.- The sites of the other two ligands are occupied by two anionic cyclopentadieny1 rings. Attempts to modify the cyclopentadienide rings lead to a decreased biological activity.In a very recent U.S. Patent No. 5,002,969 there are described cytostatic pharmaceutical compositions based on titanocene complexes. A group which is present in all these complexes is an amino or substituted amino
