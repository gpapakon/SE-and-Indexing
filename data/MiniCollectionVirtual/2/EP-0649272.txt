<ABSTRACT>
Method of manufacturing a flexible fastening member, flexible fastening member and 
object provided with such a fastening member, support provided with an object and with 

such a fastening member, and packaging provided with a number of such fastening 
members. 
The invention relates to a method of manufacturing a flexible fastening 
member (19) comprising a foil (1) for fastening an object (15) thereto, characterized by 

making at least two generally U-shaped incisions (5) which are spaced apart, which 
define a central portion (23) between them, and which are directed oppositely to 

another, the open ends of the U-shapes facing away from another so as to create two 
mutually opposed tags (11), and by bending the foil (1) along two parallel bending lines 

(13), each line being situated at the open end of a U-shaped incision (5) so as to obtain 
a generally U-shaped member (19) whose base is said central portion (23), and to obtain 

the tags (11) as extensions of the legs (25) of said U-shaped member and situated at one 
side of the plane (20) defined by the central portion (23), the legs (25) being situated at 

the other side of said plane (20). 
The invention also relates to a fastening member obtained by the method, 
an object provided with such a fastening member, a support provided with an object and 

such a fastening member, and a packaging provided with a number of such fastening 
members.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a method of manufacturing a flexible fastening 
member comprising a foil for fastening an object thereto. The invention also relates to a flexible fastening member for fastening an 
object thereto, an object provided with such a fastening member, a support provided 
with an object and such a fastening member, and a packaging provided with a number 
of such fastening members. Patent US-A 4647126 discloses a flexible fastening member of the kind 
mentioned in the opening paragraph which is fastened at one side to a component 
(object) and at another side to a printed circuit board (support). If the component is 
fastened directly to the printed circuit board, mechanical stresses may arise in the 
component, the printed circuit board, and the connection between component and 
printed circuit board owing to differences in coefficient of thermal expansion between 
the component and the printed circuit board. Such stresses also arise upon bending of 
the printed circuit board. The stresses may cause the connection, the component, or the 
printed circuit board to break. The flexible fastening member absorbs the stresses and 
ensures that forces exerted on the printed circuit board are not transmitted to the 
component. The flexible fastening member is manufactured from a metal foil of which 
only a portion is used. The remainder of the foil metal is scrap material. Furthermore, 
at least two fastening members are required for each component. The invention has for its object to provide a method of manufacturing a 
flexible fastening member for which the entire foil is used to avoid waste of material 
and with which a fastening member is obtained for easy fastening of an object thereto. To this end the method of manufacturing a flexible fastening member is  
 
characterized by 
making at least two generally U-shaped incisions which are spaced apart, which 
define a central portion between them, and which are directed oppositely to one 
another, the open ends of the U-shapes facing away from one another so as to 
create two mutually opposed tags, and bending the foil along two parallel bending lines, each line being situated at the 
open end of a U-shaped incision so as to obtain a generally U-shaped member, 
whose base is said central portion, and to obtain the tags as extensions of the 
legs of said U-shaped member and being situated at one side of the plane 
defined by the central portion, the legs being situated at the other side of said 
plane. The term "generally U-shaped incision"
</DESCRIPTION>
<CLAIMS>
A method of manufacturing a flexible fastening member comprising a foil (1) 
for fastening an object thereto, the method having the following steps: 


making in the foil at least two generally U-shaped incisions (5) which are spaced apart, which 
define a central portion (3b) between them, and which are directed oppositely to one 

another, the open ends of the U-shapes facing away from one another so as to 
create two mutually opposed tags (11), and 
bending the foil along two parallel bending lines (13,13), each line being situated at the 
open end of a U-shaped incision (5) so as to obtain, when seen in side elevation, a generally U-shaped member 

whose base (23) is said central portion, and to obtain the tags as extension of the 
legs of said U-shaped member and situated at one side of the plane defined by 

the central portion, the legs (25) being situated at the other side of said plane. 
A method as claimed in Claim 1, characterized in that the tags are bent at 
their ends through substantially 90° in the direction of the central portion. 
A method as claimed in Claim 1 or 2, characterized in that end portions 
of the legs remote from the tags are connected to a support. 
A method as claimed in Claim 3, characterized in that the end portions of 
the legs are bent about lines directed parallel to said parallel lines. 
A flexible fastening member comprising a foil for fastening an object 
thereto, characterized in that the member (19) is generally U-shaped in side elevation with a central portion (23) as 

the base of the U, the legs (25) being bent along parallel bending lines (13,13), said member having 
tags (11) forming extensions of the legs (25) of said U-shaped member and being an integral part 

of the legs, the tags being situated at one side of the plane defined by the central portion 
and the legs at the other side of said plane. 
A flexible fastening member as claimed in Claim 5, characterized in that 
the member is made of electrically insulating material and that at least the tags and the 

legs are provided with electrically conducting tracks. 
A flexible fastening member as claimed in Claim 6, characterized in that 
the conducting tracks are present in parallel arrangement transverse to the parallel  

 
bending lines. 
A flexible fastening member as claimed Claim 5, 6 or 7, characterized in 
that the tags are provided with end portions which are bent through substantially 90° in 

the direction of the central portion. 
A flexible fastening member as claimed in anyone of the Claims 5 to 8, 
characterized in that the legs are provided with end portions which are bent about lines 

directed parallel to said parallel lines. 
An object provided with a flexible fastening member as claimed in anyone 
of the Claims 5 to 9, characterized in that the object is supported by said central portion 

and by said tags. 
An object provided with a flexible fastening member as claimed in Claim 
6, characterized in that the object is electrically connected to the conducting tracks. 
A support provided with an object as 
claimed in Claim 10 or 11, characterized in that the object is situated at said one side of 

the plane defined by the central portion, while the support is situated at said other side 
of said plane and is connected to said end portions of the legs. 
A support as claimed in Claim 12, characterized in that the support and 
the object are electrically connected to the conducting tracks. 
A packaging provided with a number of flexible fastening members as 
claimed in Claim 5, characterized in that the members are interconnected by means of 

the end portions of the legs.
