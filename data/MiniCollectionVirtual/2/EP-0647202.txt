<ABSTRACT>
The present invention relates to an arrangement (1) for a coveyor (2) comprising a driven endlesss flexible belt (5) running around deflector devices (3, 4). In accordance with the invention, the load-bearing part of the conveyor belt (5) is so arranged as to be formed by and supported on a formed supporting surface (7) which exhibits a transition from an essentially plane form to a curved form.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a conveyor
comprising a driven endless flexible belt running
around deflector devices the load-bearing part of
the belt is so arranged as to be formed by and
supported on a supporting surface which exhibits in
longitudinal direction a transition from an
essentially plane form to a curved form completely
bridging the distance between side walls of
supporting frame sections and further comprising
belt edge delimiting devices extending along said
supporting surface.Such a conveyor is disclosed in GB-A-638 681. A
supporting surface of said conveyor is arranged
between end walls of supporting frame sections. The
supporting surface exhibits in longitudinal
direction a transition from an initial plane form
to a curved form completely bridging the distance
between the end walls. The supporting surface is
fixed to the end walls with integral edge flanges
extending at right angles to flat adjacent section
portion of the supporting surface. To these
outwardly bent edge flanges of the supporting
surface longitudinally extending L-shaped sheet
metal guard members are attached rigidly. These
guard members are formed with integral guard
flanges disposed in spaced parallel overlapping
relationship with adjacent flat section portions of
the supporting surface so as to provide
therebetween a groove in which the adjacent edge of
the upper run of the belt can run freely. The above mentioned conveyor turns out to be
satisfactory with regard to a continuous support of
the upper run of the belt and efficient protection
of the longitudinal edges of the belt from the
transported material but shows some deficiencies
with respect to the rather complicated overall
construction, the need to adapt the guard members
to the inclinations of both the end walls of the
supporting frame sections and the flat section
portions of the supporting surface. Furthermore, it
may happen that dusty highly fine-grained loaded
bulk material penetrates between small gap-like
openings between the outwardly bent edge flanges of
the supporting surface and the guard members inside
the supporting frame sections causing damaging of
sensitive elements of drive unit means like rollers
provided with bearings.WO-A-9 101 632 discloses a conveyor with a flat
belt inclosed by a cover member.The main object of this invention is to overcome
these deficiencies and to provide a conveyor which
is easy to assemble and permits the transport of
bulk material reliably and efficiently.This object is achieved by means of a conveyor in
accordanc

<CLAIMS>
Conveyor (2) comprising a driven endless
flexible belt (5) running around deflector

devices (3, 4), the load-bearing part of the
belt (5) being so arranged as to be formed by and

supported on a supporting surface (7) which
exhibits in longitudinal direction a transition

from an essentially plane form to a curved form
completely bridging the distance (A) between

side walls (11) of supporting frame sections
(10) and further comprising belt edge

delimiting devices (16) extending along said
supporting surface (7), 
characterized in that

said supporting frame sections (10) comprise a
base (12) and inwardly angled upper attachment

parts (13) situated above each side wall (11),
in that lateral parts (15) of said supporting

surface (7) exhibit a transition to belt edge
delimiting devices (16) formed from pairs of

inwardly angled edge parts of the respective
supporting surface (7) interacting with a

respective longitudinal belt edge (5A, 5B) so
as to guide the belt (5) along the

longitudinal belt edges (5A, 5B) by said
lateral parts (15) and the belt edge delimiting

devices (16), the lateral parts (15) and the belt edge
delimiting devices (16) being integrally formed with said

supporting surface (7), and in that the
supporting surface (7) is attached to the supporting

frame sections (10) in the area of the
respective upper attachment part (13). 
Conveyor in accordance with claim 1,
characterized in that a desired number of supporting

surface sections (9) is capable of
being joined together in an longitudinal sense

(8) by means of connecting elements (18) which
bridge and connect together pairs of supporting

frame sections (10), preferably strap-shaped
elements which extend beneath and to the side.
Conveyor in accordance with claim 1 or 2,
characterized in that the outside of the

respective supporting surface (7) forms an supporting
surface for a removable conveyor cover

(17).
Conveyor in accordance with one or other of the
above claims, characterized in that at least a

number of the supporting surfaces (7),
supporting frame sections (10) an connections

(18) contained in the conveyor (2) are made of
galvanized sheet, plastic or a similar

material.
