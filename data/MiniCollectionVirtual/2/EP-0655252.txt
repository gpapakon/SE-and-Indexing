<ABSTRACT>
Glicentin may be used in agents for suppressing 
the motor activity of gastrointestinal tracts, which comprise 

glicentin as an active ingredient. They can be used as an 
adjunct for use in examination of gastrointestinal tracts by 

radiography or endoscopy. The agents may also be used in the 
treatment of short gut syndrome, cul-de-sac syndrome, 

indigestible malabsorption syndrome and dumping syndrome.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to the use of glicentin in the manufacture of a medicament for suppressing
the motor activity of gastrointestinal tracts, which
comprises glicentin as an active ingredient. More
particularly, the invention relates to such a use
for temporarily suppressing the motor activity of
gastrointestinal tracts during the abdominal examination.Glicentin which is one of enteroglucagons is a
peptide comprising 69 amino acid residues. For example,
human glicentin is composed of the following amino acid
sequence
Glicentin was isolated and purified from porcine
intestine by F. Sundby et al in 1976 (F. Sundby et al, Horm.
Metab. Res. 8 (1976) 366-371). The structure of glicentin
has been established by A. J. Moody et al (L. Thim and A. J.
Moody, Regul. Pept. 2 (1981) 139-150). It has been difficult to study human glicentin
using its purified product, since the human organs such as
gastrointestinal tracts were difficult to obtain in large
quantities.Now, the present inventors were successful in
synthesizing DNA corresponding to the amino acid sequence of
human glicentin which was deduced by G. I. Bell (Nature,
304, 368-371 (1983)) from the sequence of human
preproglucagon gene and preparing human glicentin by means
of genetic engineering procedure using the synthesized DNA
which was disclosed in Japanese Patent Kokai Hei 4-364199.
This results in easy availability of human glicentin as its
purified product in large amounts.Butylscopolamine bromide injections have been used
as the agents for temporarily suppressing the motor activity
of gastrointestinal tracts in the medical examinations of
the digestive tracts, such as gastrointestinal
roentgenologic examination and endoscopic examination.
However, such butylscopolamine bromides have an effect on
the systemic autonomic nervous system, thus leading to the
disadvantages of bringing about side effects such as thirst,
dizziness and ataxia. Further, may be used glucagon as a
peptidic agent for suppressing the motor activity of
gastrointestinal tracts. However, glucagon is not a
suitable agent, because of its unfavorable action to induce
a sudden rise in blood glucose. The present inventors found for the first time that human glicentin suppresses
the gastrointestinal motility, thus leading to the present invention.According to the present invention, there is provided the use of glicentin in
the preparation of a medicament for use in the suppression of the motor activity of
the gastrointestinal tract, for examination.The present invention also provides a
