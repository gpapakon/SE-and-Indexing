<ABSTRACT>
The present invention relates in summary to a heating apparatus including a burner and a heat exchanger (1). The burner, which is preferably gas or oil fired, heats a primary fluid, which surrenders its heat in the heat exchanger (1) to a secondary fluid. A pipe (11) formed in a series of loops is arranged to pass into the heat exchanger (1) secondary fluid which has been heated through the combustion gases from the burner.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to heating apparatus, preferably such 
as are oil-fired, which include a heat exchanger, and which are 
intended for supplementing or replacing conventional heating 
installations, e.g. for small house boilers and the like. As a result of increases in the price of oil, and since oil is 
occasionally a commodity difficult to obtain, it has become more 
and more desirable to obtain effective installations for heating 
purposes which are economical with regard to fuel and which also 
have a low price. This invention is described, per se, in connection 
with problems concerning one-family houses, but one skilled in the 
art will understand that the invention has many conceivable applications 
and is thus not restricted to this field. There are oil-fired heat exchangers provided with equipment such 
that the flue gases can give their heat content to the fluid which 
is to be heated and which conveys the heat to such as radiators in 
a building. A heating system of this type is described in US-2,320,532, and 
comprises a burner, a passage for hot gas from the burner, a liquid 
jacket (or chamber) surrounding said passage and containing a primary 
fluid, which heats a secondary fluid flowing through a coilformed 
pipe, disposed within said jacket or chamber. The secondary fluid is 
used for domestic heating purposes. In certain cases, such as in the device disclosed in US-A-4318366, there is thus a pre-heater placed in 
the flue gas passage for also pre-heating the fluid which distributes 
the heat. However, this is not a particularly good solution 
if it is taken into consideration that the flue gases contain 
substances, which can condense and form coke-like deposits as well 
as forming corrosive substances which can put great requirements on 
the material in the heat exchanger and flue gas passage. In addition, 
such installations will be voluminous. A desire is therefore to achieve a combustion-driven heat exchanger, 
in which the heat in the flue gases is recovered to a certain 
extend and used for heating purposes. Another desire is to achieve 
a compact and cheap unit, which can easily be connected into the 
system as required. The present invention has the object of providing a combustion-driven 
heat exchanger while mitigating the above-mentioned problems, 
and which satisfies the mentioned desires. This object is achieved 
by a structure of the kind disclosed in the claims, which also  
  
 
disclose what is characteristic for the invention. The invention will now be

<CLAIMS>
A heating apparatus comprising a burner and a heat exchanger 
(1), said burner heating a primary fluid, which circulates 

through the heat exchanger (1) to transmit heat of the primary 
fluid to a secondary fluid in the heat exchanger (1), the heat 

exchanger being provided with a tube (4) which extends through 
the heat exchanger (1) and forming a passage (8) for exhaust 

gases from the burner,
characterized by
 
the heat exchanger (1) including a chamber (5) for the primary 

fluid flow, said chamber (5) surrounding the tube (4), as well 
as a pipe (11) for conducting the secondary fluid, said pipe 

being disposed into the chamber (5) and then around the tube (4), 
whereafter it extends through the tube (4) into the passage (8), 

where it forms one or more loops, and then extends out of the 
heat exchanger (1), whereby the pipe (11) is so disposed as to 

lead the secondary fluid first through the primary fluid in the 
chamber (5) and thereafter through the exhaust gases as the 

exhaust gases flow through the tube (4), the exhaust gases being 
led through the passage (8) for heating the wall of the tube (4) 

as well as said one or more loops of the pipe (11). 
Heating apparatus as claimed in claim 1, wherein the heat 
exchanger is made as a substantially cylindrical container 

through which the flue gas tube (4) extends axially. 
Heating apparatus as claimed in claim 1 or 2, wherein the 
tube (4) has an inlet and an outlet (10) for the exhaust gases, 

provided at one end each of the tube (4), and wherein said 
passage (8) has a greater diameter than the inlet (9) for the 

combustion gases coming into it.  
 
Heating apparatus as claimed in any of the preceding claims, 
wherein the burner is an oil burner with a variable heating 

effect.
