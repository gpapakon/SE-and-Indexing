<ABSTRACT>
Tapered optical waveguides (33') can be easily made by using 
photolithographic masking and etching to define on a substrate (21) a first polymer 

structure (22) having a substantially uniform thickness and a tapered width. The first 
polymer structure is heated sufficiently to form a meniscus along its entire length. 

The fluidity causes the material to redistribute itself such that, rather than being of 
uniform thickness, it has a thickness that varies with its width; consequently, the 

thickness as well as the width of the first polymer structure becomes tapered. The 
first po
lymer is cooled and hardened to form a second polymer structure (22') that 
has a tapered width and a tapered thickness as is desirable for a tapered optical 

waveguide. The second polymer structure itself can be used as a tapered optical 
waveguide, or it can be used to control the reactive ion etching of the underlying 

substrate. In the latter case, the configuration of the tapered second polymer 
structure is replicated in a glass substrate, for example, which then may be used as a 

glass tapered optical waveguide (33').

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to methods for making and using microstructures 
and, more particularly, to methods for making and using optical waveguide 
structures. Because of the increased importance of lightwaves for transmitting 
information, considerable work has been done in recent years to develop techniques 
for operating on transmitted information-carrying light to produce various device 
functions. Such devices usually require optical waveguides such as optical fibers, 
lasers for generating light, and photodetectors for detecting light. Lenses are usually 
used to couple lightwaves from one component to another. The U.S. patent of Blonder et al., No. 5,182,787, is an example of the 
prior art relating to planar optical waveguides. Such waveguides are defined by a 
thin layer of glass of high refractive index material contained between layers of glass 
of lower refractive index. The configuration of the high refractive index layer 
defines the optical path of the waveguide, which, because of its resemblance to an 
electronic printed circuit, is sometimes known as an optical printed circuit. The U.S. 
patent of Burack et al., No. 5,208,892, is an example of the prior art describing the 
use of thin polymer films as optical waveguides. The most common transmission medium for lightwaves is the optical 
fiber, typically having a glass outer diameter of one hundred twenty-five microns and 
a core diameter of six microns. Lenses must normally be used for coupling light 
from an optical fiber to a photonics device, such as a photodetector, or to a planar 
optical waveguide, which typically has a smaller thickness than that of the core of 
the optical fiber. Each transition requiring a lens results in significant optical losses. The U.S. patent of Koch et al., No. 4,944,838, granted July 31, 1990, 
describes the use of tapered optical waveguides or "tapers" for more efficiently 
coupling light between two dissimilar devices, such as an optical fiber and a planar 
optical waveguide. The patent points out that prior attempts to make tapered optical 
waveguides lack the controllability needed to reduce losses. The solution of the 
patent is to use a layered semiconductor structure which is etched to form a 
staircase-like core or guiding structure. This constitutes a relatively complex 
solution, and there remains a long-felt need in the industry for methods to make  
 
tapered optical waveguides that are relatively simple and require little operator skill. We have found that tapered optical waveguides can be

A method for making a tapered microstructure comprising the steps 
of: 

   defining a first polymer structure (22) on a substrate (21), the first 
polymer structure having a substantially uniform thickness and a tapered width; 

   heating the first polymer structure sufficiently to form a meniscus along 
substantially its entire length, whereby the thickness of the first polymer structure 

tapers; 
   and hardening said polymer to form a second polymer structure (22')

The method of claim 1 wherein: 
   the substrate is made of glass; 

   and the second polymer structure and the substrate are placed in an RIE 
reactor (FIG. 6) and are reactively ion etched, said reactive ion etching resulting in a 

substantial replication of the configuration of the second polymer structure in an 
upper surface of said glass substrate. 
The method of claim 3 wherein: 
   said replication in said glass substrate constitutes a first glass structure 

(33'); and further comprising the step of:

index glass and an upper layer (33) of relatively high refractive index glass; 
   said second polymer structure is formed on the upper layer of said

polymer structure, whereby, during the heating step, the material of the first polymer 

structure flows on said wetting layer.
