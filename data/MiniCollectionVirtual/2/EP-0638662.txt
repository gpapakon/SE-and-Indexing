<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a process for recovering
spent or exhausted copper etching solutions.As is well known, in copper etching industry they often
have resort to chemical etching processes.For instance, this is the case with electronic industry
in the production of printed circuit boards. In an etching
machine or line an active etching solution comprising ammonium
chloride and small percentages of other chemical agents is
introduced into suitable continuous baths, in which solution
duroplast/copper assemblies are dipped, whose portion made up
of the thin copper sheet provided on them is removed from the
same through selective etching resulting from chemical attack
carried out by the solution, so as to obtain the formation of
conductive paths according to a previously established topography,
i.e. electric circuits.The active etching solution, after removing a portion
of copper from the duroplast, that is the support, leaves the
last bath of the etching machine or line as a "spent" solution,
i.e. as a copper-containing solution, its concentration being
up to 150 g of copper/liter, as cupric chloride, that is as a
very poisonous solution.It is fully evident that it is necessary to recover
both chemical agents and the metal or metals contained in such
spent solutions. Total recovery is not only an economic factor,
but it is mainly an ecological necessity. Such recovery
satisfies the requisites of avoiding dispersion of such
poisonous solutions into the environment, and of safeguarding 
metal resources as well, which surely are not endless.Various processes have been known heretofore to
treat the subject solutions.One process is known from US Patent
No. 4,083,758 (Hamby et al.)
having the title "Process for Regeneration
and for Recovering Metallic Copper from Chloride-Containing
Etching Solutions. In such a patent a process
is disclosed for recovering copper values in metallic
form from an aquesous, ammoniacal etching solution
containing the copper values along with chloride ions,
the etching solution being derived from the etching of
printed electronic circuit boards with a mixture of
ammonium hydroxide and ammonium chloride, comprising the
steps of: (a) intimately mixing the etching solution with
an organic medium containing an exchange reagent which is
capable of extracting copper and chloride ions from the
solution, thereby producing a dispersion comprising an
aqueous phase and an organic phase, the organic phase
containing the exchange reagent, the copper ions and the
chloride ions; (b) separating
