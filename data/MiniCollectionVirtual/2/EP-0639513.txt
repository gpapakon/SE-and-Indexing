<ABSTRACT>
A high impact resistant package system 
10
 for 
a container of fragile products, such as X-ray 

cassettes, has a plurality of shock absorbing 
polyethylene plastic foam corner protector members 
12
 
mounted on corner edges 
14,16,20,22
 of the container. 
Alternatively, a flexible material layer 
50
 overwraps 
the product container 
18
 and corner protector members 

12
, thereby forming a unitized package system. 
Portions of the corner protector members 
12
 extend 
beyond the corner edges 
14,16,20,22
 and sides of the 
container so as to fully absorb exposure to shock 

during handling and shipment. In an alternative 
embodiment, the flexible layer 
50
 is provided with a 
peelable strip 
40
. An end portion 
42
 of the strip 
40
 
is allowed to extend through an aperture 
44
 formed in 
the flexible layer 
50
. In this embodiment, access to 
the container is gained by grasping the end portion 
42
 
of strip 
40
 and pulling it away from the container 
18
.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates in general to 
packaging. More particularly, the invention concerns a 
packaging system that provides improved high impact 
resistance for containers of fragile products, such as 
photoactive products, during shipment and handling. Many manufactured goods, particularly 
containers that hold fragile products, such as 
photoactive products, resemble box-like configurations 
and often have attractive finishes on the exterior 
surfaces. In order to protect these products from 
damage, manufacturers often package these products in 
boxes made from corrugated paperboard. Typically 
containers of photoactive products, such as X-ray 
cassettes, are shrink wrapped for dust protection and 
then placed in a corrugated folder for damage 
protection during handling and shipment. The folder 1 
(Figures 1 & 2) generally comprises overlapping or 
rolled up portions 2 along opposing sides 3,4 of the 
product 5. These overlapping corrugated portions are 
known to be bulky, cumbersome to handle, add excessive 
weight to the product, and generate excessive waste for 
the environmental waste stream. Conventional packaging for containers of 
fragile products requires bulky materials for adequate 
packaging. Such packaging schemes are typically not 
fully recyclable and, therefore, they contribute to the 
environmental waste stream. Another problem with 
current packaging is that it is expensive to 
manufacture because of the excessive packaging material 
requirements. To protect containers of fragile 
products, such as photoactive products, from sustaining 
damage which might otherwise occur when the product 
container experiences impacts of sufficient magnitude  
 
to deform it or perhaps even cause a slight 
penetration, manufacturers have typically used 
corrugated paperboard as described previously. While edge support members have not been used 
to protect containers of photoactive products, like X-ray 
cassettes, corner protectors of some sort are known 
in other types of products for meeting various 
packaging needs. US-A-5,175,041 to Webb and others is directed 
to a corner protector formed from paper honeycomb 
material which fits between the corner of a container 
and the corner of a relatively rigid object in the 
container. A shortcoming of the Webb device is that it 
requires a rigid container in addition to the product 
container without which the honeycombed corner 
protector could not be mounted. US-A-3,939,978 to Thomaswick discloses a 
shipping container having polyethylene corner pads

<CLAIMS>
A package system for a product container enclosing 
photoactive material, said product container having 

straight sides with polygonal ends, first and second 
opposite sides and at least three corner edges, the 

package system comprising: 
   at least three substantially disk-shaped corner 

protector members, said corner protector members being 
removably mounted to opposing corner edges and one 

additional corner protector member being removably 
mounted to an adjacent one of said opposing corner 

edges, said corner protector members extending beyond 
said respective corner edge and overlapping at least a 

portion of said first and second opposite sides of said 
product container for providing a protective cushion 

for the product container; and, 
   wherein a flaccid material layer fully surrounds 

said product container and said corner protectors 
mounted thereon. 
The package recited in claim 1 wherein said corner 
protector members are made of a pliable material. 
The package recited in claim 2 wherein said pliable 
material is a polyethylene foam. 
The package recited in claim 1 wherein said corner 
protector members each is provided with a slot portion 

having a height (h) equal to or somewhat larger than 
the height (H) of the end edge of the container for 

mounting onto said corner edge. 
The package recited in claim 1 wherein said flaccid 
material layer is provided with a peelable strip bonded 

thereto, said peelable strip having an relieved end 
portion for graspably pulling a portion of the flexible 

 
material away from the product container thereby 

providing access to the product container. 
An article of manufacture, comprising: 
   a product container enclosing a photoactive 

material, said product container having substantially 
straight sides with polygonal ends, first and second 

opposite sides and at least three corner edges; 
   a corner protector member removably mounted on the 

corner edges of the product container, said corner 
protector member overlapping at least a portion of said 

first and second opposite sides of said product 
container; and, 

   a flaccid material layer fully overwrapped around 
said product container and said corner protector 

members. 
A package for a product container enclosing 
photoactive material, said product container having 

straight sides with polygonal ends, first and second 
opposite sides and at least three corner edges, said 

package made by the process comprising the steps of: 

   providing a flaccid material layer; 
   providing at least three corner protector members 

each being removably mountable onto one of said corner 
edges, said corner protector members when mounted on 

said corner edges being configured to overlap at least 
a portion of said first and second opposite sides of 

said product container for providing cushioning against 
shock; 

   mounting said corner protector members onto 
opposite corner edges and one additional corner 

protector member onto a corner edge adjacent an 
opposite corner edge; and,

 
   fully overwrapping said flaccid material layer 

around said product container and said corner 
protectors mounted thereon. 
The package recited in claim 7 wherein the process 
further comprises the step of providing a peelable 

strip bonded to said flaccid material layer, said 
peelable strip having a relieved end portion for 

graspably pulling a portion of the flaccid material 
away from the product container thereby providing 

access to the product container.
