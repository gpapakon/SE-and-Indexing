Wall covering panel having on its upper and lower part means
for fastening on a wall, each of them comprising a horizontal

wall fastening rail (22) having a horizontal intermediate web
(32) with a wall mounting flange (34) vertically projecting

downwards from one end of said web (32) and with a pick-up
flange (36) vertically projecting upwards from the opposite end

of said web (32), and further comprising a support rail (30)
fixed to the rear side (28) of the wall covering panel (16) and

having a horizontal intermediate web (38) with a mounting flange
(40) vertically projecting upwards from one end and with a

support flange (42) vertically projecting downwards from the
opposite end of said intermediate web (38) and engaging said

pick-up flange (36), characterized in that the support flange
(42) of both support rails (30) is an elastic flange comprising

at its free end a projecting edge (52) contacting said pick-up
flange (36) with preload abutment, and that the upper end of the

pick-up flange (36) of both wall fastening rails comprises an
inclined feed-in edge (54), both identically shaped wall

fastening rails being separated from each other.
Wall covering panel according to claim 1 wherein the support
rail (30) is subdivided as per se known in a plurality of

sections (30') which are distant from each other and which are
engaging said wall fastening rail (22).
Wall covering panel according to claim 2 wherein each section
(30') of the support rail (30) embraces the pick-up flange (36)

with its support flange (42) at one side and with a distance
plate (56) at the other side, said distance plate abutting the

rear side (28) of the wall covering panel (16). 
Wall covering panel according to any of the preceding claims
wherein on upper edge of said panel (16) a ledge (20) is mounted

letting a distance to said upper edge.
Wall covering panel according to claim 4 wherein the ledge
(20) is positively fixed to said upper edge by means of a

fastener (58) engaging grooves and comprising a spacer element
(60).
Wall covering panel according to any of the preceding claims
wherein the profile of the wall mounting flange (34) protrudes

from the rear side (28) of at least the lower part of the wall
covering panel (16).
