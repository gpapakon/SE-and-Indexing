<ABSTRACT>
An architecture is disclosed for communication of remote devices 
to a digitizing display (22). The architecture includes a contact 

sensing erasure mechanism and a position sensing erasure 
mechanism whose outputs are multiplexed for transmission from 

the stylus (20) to an antenna located proximate to the digitizing 
display (22). The digitizing display (22) will erase text or graphics 

data in a pen-based computer system (74) in response to the stylus (20). 
A calibration method provides improved accuracy for the erasure 

function.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention disclosed broadly relates to data processing
systems and more particularly relates to improvements in
input/output devices for pen-based computer systems.The following patents and patent applications are assigned to
the IBM Corporation.USP 4,686,332 entitled "Combined Finger Touch and Stylus
Detection System for Use on the Viewing Surface on a Visual
Display Device," by Evon C. Greanias, et al.USP 5,007,085 entitled "Remotely Sensed Personal Stylus," by
Evon C. Greanias, et al.USP 5,117,071 entitled "Stylus Sensing System," by Evon C.
Greanias, et al.Copending U. S. patent application serial number 07/778,431 (US-A-5 386 219),
filed October 16, 1991 entitled "Touch Overlay for Improved
Touch Sensitivity," by Evon C. Greanias, et al.Copending U.S. patent application serial number 07/351,227 (âˆ§EP-A-0 398 055),
filed May 15, 1989 entitled "Flat Touch Screen Workpad for a
Data Processing System," by Gordon W. Arbeitman, et al. 
Copending U. S. patent application serial number 07/969,864 (US-A-5 349 139),
filed October 30, 1992 entitled "Architecture for Communication
of Remote Devices to a Digitizing Display," by Guy F. Verrier,
et al.Pen-based computer systems have been described in the prior art,
for example in the above referenced USP 4,686,332 by Greanias,
et al. In that system, a touch overlay membrane is positioned
over the viewing surface of a display device such as a computer
monitor, for interacting with a pickup stylus. The pickup stylus
described in the '332 patent is connected by means of a wire to
the pen-based computer system. The pen-based computer system
generates a radiative signal in the touch overlay. The radiative
signal is picked up by the stylus and sent back over the wire to
the pen-based computer. The computer then calculates the
relative X-Y position of the stylus with respect to the overlay.
The relative proximity Z of the stylus to the overlay is
determined by the signal amplitude picked up by the stylus from
the electromagnetic energy radiated from the overlay. An
improvement in the stylus pickup antenna is described in the
above cited USP 5,117,071 by Greanias, et al. In the '071
patent, the antenna configuration in the tip of the stylus is a
small sphere, whose shape enables a uniform signal strength to
be picked up without regard for the relative orientation of the
stylus with respect to the planar surface of the overlay. A
further improvement has been made to the stylus by eliminating
the cable connection between the stylus and the pen-based
computer system, as
