<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention is related to a method and
composition for the treatment of a variety of disorders
involving immunological dysfunctions. More particularly, the
present invention relates to the treatment of certain
immunological disorders comprising the step of administering
ribonucleotide polymerase, or a compound related to
ribonucleotide polymerase, at very low concentrations to a
human or animal with an immunological dysfunction. In
certain situations, synergists, such as glycerin, glutamine or
other synergists, can be administered with the ribonucleotide
polymerase to enhance therapeutic activity.The abnormal functioning of the cell-mediated
and/or humoral immune response in animals or humans can
result in the manifestation of disorders which are not
anaphylactic in nature, but result in abnormal targeting of
certain disease tissues. Disorders involving immunological 
dysfunction cause a wide variety of symptoms. Examples of
immunodeficiency disorders are diseases which mask immune
targeting, such as various malignancies, herpes related
disorders, Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome (HIV
infections), and diseases in which the host itself manufactures
self-destructive substances including, but not limited to,
systemic lupus erythematosus, arthritis, diabetes, thyroiditis,
hemolytic anemia, atrophy orchitis, Goodpastures disease,
autoimmune retinopathy, autoimmune thrombocytopenia,
sympathetic ophthalmia, myasthenia gravis, Graves disease,
primary biliary cirrhosis, chronic aggressive hepatitis,
ulcerative colitis, membrane glomerulopathy, dermatitis,
laminitis, chronic glomerulonephritis, Sj√∂grens syndrome,
Reiters syndrome, myositis, systemic sclerosis, polyarteritis
and multiple sclerosis.In prior years it was believed that an anti-self
response was harmful and that such responses did not occur
normally. More recently, it has become apparent that normal
immune responses involve self-self recognition. Moreover,
many individuals produce nonpathogenic antibodies reactive
with self-antigens. As a result, our present understanding is
that disease occurs only when anti-self reactions are either
excessive or productive of especially injurious immune
responses.A disease state resulting from the abnormal
targeting of the humoral or cell-mediated response to
immunogens (either external or internal) is manifested by a
hypersensitivity response. Such a response is usually classified
as one of four types:
Type I: Anaphylactic reactions. These reactions are mediated
by IgE antibodies which bind to
