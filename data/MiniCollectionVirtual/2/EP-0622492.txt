Arrangement for metering a coating mixture onto a running paper or cardboard 
web which is guided in particular by a roller (R) in or by the arrangement, in 

which 

(a) a blade (2) is pressed onto the web - at least also - by means of a 
pressure pad (5) or a plurality of pressure elements, 
(b) there is a transmitter (9) for light - in particular laser light, 
(c) the blade (2) in the region between the bearing line of the pressure pad (5) 
or plurality of pressure elements thereon and its bearing line on the web 

comprises at least one light reflecting layer (8) on its side facing away from 

the blade to reflect the beam of light (12) transmitted by the transmitter (9) 
onto the layer (8), 
(d) a receiver (10) is provided for recording the position or the angle of the 
beam (13) reflected on it by the light reflecting layer (8) of the blade (2) and 
(e) there is a control device (30) to control the angular position of the blade (2) 
in its zone between the bearing line of the pressure pad (5) or the pressure 

element and the web in dependency on the positioning signal of the receiver 
(10) for the reflected beam of light (13). 
Arrangement according to claim 1, characterised in that the pressure pad (5) is 
designed to be flexible in direction - perpendicular - to the blade. 
Arrangement according to claim 1 or 2, characterised by regulating devices which 
are distributed evenly along the blade length and serve to adjust locally the 

pressing force of the blade (2) via the pressure pad (5) or pressure elements. 
Arrangement according to one of claims 1 - 3, characterised in that the light 
reflecting layer (8) is made of a foil (11). 
Arrangement according to one of claims 1 - 3, characterised in that the light 
reflecting layer (8') is attached to magnetic chips or strips as carriers (7) for 

securing it onto the blade.  
 
Arrangement according to claim 5, characterised in that the magnetic carrier (7) is 
wedge-shaped in order to permit an adjustment of the desired incident and 

emergence angle of the transmitted beam of light (12) in relation to the plane 
which passes through the blade (2) in the region of its bearing line on the web. 
Arrangement according to claim 6, characterised in that the carrier (7) and the 
light reflecting layer (8') attached thereto are designed as glass mirror chips (6) 

which are at most 25 mm
2
 in size. 
Arrangement according to claim 3, characterised in that the weight per unit area of 
the foil including the light reflecting layer (8) is at most 50 g/m
2
.
