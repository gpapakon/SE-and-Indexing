<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to hydrophobic, free-flowing constituent granules having a mean particle size of from 5 to 150  mu m which comprise one or preferably more than one hydrophilic inorganic powder having a particle size of 
>
 0 to 30  mu m, and one or more than one hydrophobic polyorganosiloxane in an amount of from 0.03 to 15 % by weight, to a process for the preparation thereof, and to the use thereof.

<CLAIMS>
Method of producing hydrophobic, free-flowing granular coating materials having
an average particle size of 5 to 150 µm and a content of polyorganosiloxanes of

0,03 to 15 % by weight ad optionally one or more temporary and/or permanent
binders in an amount up to 15 % by weight,
characterized in that

one or preferably more hydrophilic inorganic powders with an average particle
size of 
>
 0 to 30 µm are mixed in a granulating unit with a aqueous emulsion
of one or more hydrophobic polyorganosiloxanes in an amount of 0,05 to 15 %

by weight of polyorganosiloxane, preferably 0,05 to 3 % by weight of polyorganosiloxane,
with respect to the inorganic powder(s), optionally with the

addition of up to 15 % by weight of one or more temporary and/or permanent
binders in an aqueous medium, and are subsequently calcined for up to 24 hours

at a temperature between 120 and 600° C, preferably between 200 and 400° C.
Method according to claim 1, characterized in that glaze materials, frits, glasses,
pigments, inorganic colouring bodies, metals, metal alloys, or metal oxides,

nitrides, carbides, sulphides and/or borides are used as the inorganic powders.
Method of claims 1 or 2, characterized in that the granular coating materials are
produced from a aqueous suspension of the hydrophobic inorganic powders with

the addition of the aqueous emulsion of the polyorganosiloxane(s) and optionally
of the further organic and/or inorganic binder(s) in a spray drying device.
Use of the hydrophobic, free-flowing granular coating materials produced by the
method of one of claims 1 to 3 for electrostatic deposition on substrates,

particularly on ceramic substrates. 
Use of the hydrophobic, free-flowing granular coating materials produced by the
method of one of claims 1 to 3 for the production of ceramic coatings or

hydrophobic media such as plastics or lacquers, respectively.
Use of the hydrophobic, free-flowing granular coating materials produced by the
method of one of claims 1 to 3 for incorporating into ceramic coatings or

hydrophobic media such as plastics or lacquers, respectively.
Use of the hydrophobic, free-flowing granular coating materials produced by the
method of one of claims 1 to 3 for the production of enamel coatings (enamels).
