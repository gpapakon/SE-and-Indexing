<ABSTRACT>
A cosmetic product is provided that stores a cosmetic composition in a capsule having a spheroidal body with hollow chamber forming a major portion of the capsule, a tab forming a minor portion of the capsule, and a neck section connecting the tab with the spheroidal body. At least two wings are positioned along opposite sides of the spheroidal body perpendicularly extending outward therefrom. Upon twisting, the neck can be broken to allow release of cosmetic composition from within the chamber.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention concerns cosmetic capsules. In particular, 
it relates to cosmetic capsules containing unit doses of 
cosmetic compositions. Cosmetics are generally packaged in relatively large 
containers in amounts that provide multiple doses. Bulk 
packaging has certain disadvantages. Once opened, the 
contents of a package become exposed to moisture and air. 
These forces can be quite detrimental to sensitive 
ingredients forming the cosmetic product. With bulk 
packaging, a manufacturer also cannot control individual 
dosage levels which are most effective and safe; the 
consumer is burdened with this responsibility. 
Invariably, usage will either be too high or too low. Single or unit dose packages of various descriptions have 
been disclosed in the art. Capsules are one of the newest 
vehicles for delivering unit dosages of cosmetic products. 
Recently the Revlon Corporation introduced a product 
called Age-less(R). The product is a composition of 
vitamin E, sunscreens, and moisturizers which have been 
sealed into vitamin-like capsules. These elongated 
capsules are meant to be pierced and their contents 
squeezed onto the skin. Certain problems are, however, 
associated with the packaging vehicle. For instance, a 
sharp pointed instrument is necessary to pierce the 
capsule walls; this may readily lead to injury. An 
opening mechanism that would avoid necessity for procuring 
any opening instrument would also be more convenient. 
Furthermore, there is danger in shaping cosmetic products 
to look like vitamins. Children, or even adults, may 
inadvertently mistake the product and ingest it.  
 La Prairie Corporation has marketed a cosmetic called Skin 
Caviar(R) which is a skin-care lotion contained in tiny 
egglike globes that are popped and rubbed onto the face. 
A problem with round packaging lies in the tendency for 
them to roll away. There is also no easy handle by which 
they may be gripped. As an answer to the roll-away problem, U.S. 
Patent 5,063,057 (Spellman et al) discloses a cosmetic 
capsule having a round body with hollow chamber forming a 
major portion of the capsule, a tab forming a minor 
portion of the capsule and a neck section connecting the 
tab with the round body. Upon twisting, the neck can be 
broken to allow release of the cosmetic composition from 
within the chamber. Circumferentially encompassing the 
round body is an outwardly projecting ring functioning to 
prevent undesirable roll. Although the patent may have solved the roll problem, 
there still remains the

A cosmetic product comprising: 

a cosmetic composition pharmaceutically acceptable 
for application to a human body; and 
a capsule completely enclosing the cosmetic 
composition, the capsule comprising: 


(i) a spheroidal body defined by an outer wall and 
having a hollow chamber, the spheroidal body 

forming a major portion of the capsule, the 
spheroidal body also including at least two 

wings on opposite sides of the spheroidal body 
perpendicularly extending outward therefrom; 
(ii) a tab forming a minor portion of the capsule; 
and 
(iii) a neck section connecting the tab with the 
spheroidal body, the neck section upon being 

twisted breaking to allow exit of the 
composition from the chamber. 
A product according to claim 1 wherein the hollow 
chamber has a capacity for holding from about 0.05 to 

about 5 grams of said cosmetic composition. 
A product according to claim 1 or claim 2 wherein at 
least a portion of the neck section is hollow. 
A product according to any of the preceding claims 
wherein the capsule has walls formed from a gelatin. 
A product according to any of the preceding claims 
wherein the capsule has walls formed of homo and 

copolymers derived from polymerization of a monomer 
selected from the group consisting of vinyl chloride,  

 
vinyl alcohol, vinyl pyrrolidone, furan, acrylonitrile, 

vinyl acetate, methyl acrylate, methyl 
methacrylate, styrene, vinyl ethyl ether, vinyl 

propyl ether, acrylamide, ethylene, propylene, 
acrylic acid, methacrylic acid, maleic anhydride, 

salts of any of the aforementioned acids and mixtures 
thereof. 
A product according to claim 5 wherein the substance 
forming said capsule is polyvinyl alcohol. 
A product according to any of the preceding claims 
wherein the cosmetic composition comprises a vehicle 

selected from the group consisting of water, silicone 
polymer and mixtures thereof. 
A product according to any of the preceding claims 
wherein the cosmetic composition is substantially 

anhydrous. 
A product according to claim 8 wherein the cosmetic 
composition includes a silicone polymer as a major 

component thereof. 
A product according to any of the preceding claims 
wherein the cosmetic composition comprises an active 

ingredient selected from the group consisting of 
sunscreens, suntanning agents, skin antiwrinkling 

agents, antidandruff agents, antiacne agents, hair 
growth stimulants and mixtures thereof.  

 
A product according to any of the preceding claims 
wherein the at least two wings are in a common plane 

equatorially cutting the spheroidal body and the 
plane also intersects with the tab. 
A product according to any of the preceding claims 
wherein an outward edge of the wings possesses a 

concave and convex profile. 
A product according to any of the preceding claims 
wherein the wings at an end thereof distant from said 

tab form a wedge pointing away from said spheroidal 
body. 
A product according to any of the preceding claims 
wherein an end of said spheroidal body opposite that 

of said tab is free of any wing projecting outward 
therefrom.
