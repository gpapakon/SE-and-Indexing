<ABSTRACT>
A moulding material for forming tubes of fibre reinforced 
resins comprises a central tube substantially impervious to 

fluid pressure, at least one matrix resin tubular layer, and at 
least one reinforcement fibre tubular layer, each of which 

layers is substantially separate, the resin and fibre layers 
alternating and located co-axially about the central tube. The 

material can be formed and moulded without disturbing the 
arrangement of the fibres.

<DESCRIPTION>

 MOULDING MATERIAL FOR FIBRE   REINFORCED    PLASTIC TUBES   Background    of the invention
Field of the invention
 This invention relates to the moulding material useful for forming fibre reinforced plastic tubes, particularly bent tubular structures.


 Fibre reinforced plastic tubes demonstrate superior physical properties such as light weight and   high    strength and are used not only for the shafts of golf clubs, fishing rods and other straight tubes but also for tone   arms    of record players, putter shafts, tennis racket frames, badminton racket frames, pipe chain frames, bicycle frames and other curved tubular structures.


 The moulding material with   which    this invention is concerned and which can be used to form tubes features a reinforcing fibre tubular layer that is kept substantially separate from a matrix resin layer. Therefore, the material is suitable for forming fibre reinforced plastic tubes according to the internal pressure moulding process using a moulding tool especially for forming curved tubes.


 With this moulding material the freedom of the reinforcing fibres to expand and contract in the process of   forking    is not interfered with by the matrix resin. Thus, the moulding material can be formed into tubular structures free   from    defects such as an undesirable bend in the reinforcing fibres so that various physical properties such as strength, of the reinforcing fibres are maintained unchanged.


Description of the prior art
 To form the fibre reinforced plastic tubes there have been used a filament winding process and a mandrel forming process using a lapping tape.


 In addition to these processes, another process has been developed. In this process a   moulding    material comprising a matrix of   resin-impregnated    reinforcing fibres is wound around the outside   periphery    of   i      flexible    rubber tube and is set in a moulding tool for pressure moulding. Pressurized gas is then charged into the  rubber tube for pressure moulding by forcing this moulding material into close contact with the inner surface of the moulding tool.


 Both the filament winding process and mandrel forming process may subject the fibre reinforcing plastic tubular layer to wrinkling in the moulding process.


 Accordingly, each of these processes requires considerable care in forming the fibre reinforced plastic tubes to ensure the reinforcing fibre tubular layer is free of wrinkles and thus maintains unimpaired the various physical properties of the reinforcing fibres.
