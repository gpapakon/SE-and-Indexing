<ABSTRACT>
In a circuit is disclosed for deriving a signal indicating interference in a received stereo multiplex signal in which the stereo multiplex signal is in the form of a digital signal with a first scanning rate which is substantially greater than twice the upper limit of the useful frequency range of the stereo multiplex signal, the received stereo multiplex signal is taken via a low pass filter, the low pass filtered signal and the received stereo multiplex signal are both subjected to decimation at a second scanning rate which is greater than twice the upper limit of the useful frequency range of the stereo multiplex signal. Both stereo multiplex signals at the second scanning rate are subtracted from each other.

<CLAIMS>
Circuit arrangement for deriving a signal
which indicates interference in a received stereo

multiplex signal, the stereo multiplex signal being
present as a digital signal with a first sampling rate,

which is significantly greater than twice the upper
limit of the useful frequency range of the stereo

multiplex signal, characterized in that the received
stereo multiplex signal is conducted via a low-pass

filter (3, 3'), in that the low-pass-filtered stereo
multiplex signal and the received stereo multiplex

signal are each subjected to a decimation (2, 6) to a
second sampling rate, which is greater than twice the

upper limit of the useful frequency range of the stereo
multiplex signal, and in that the two stereo multiplex

signals with the second sampling rate are subtracted
from one another.
Circuit arrangement according to Claim 1,
characterized in that the low-pass filter (3) has a

frequency response that falls gradually within the
useful frequency range.
Circuit arrangement according to Claim 2,
characterized in that the low-pass-filtered stereo

multiplex signal with the second sampling rate passes
through a filter (4) in order to compensate for the

falling frequency response of the low-pass filter (3).
Circuit arrangement according to Claim 3,
characterized in that the output signal of the filter

(4) can furthermore be fed, for the purpose of 
compensation, via a circuit (15) for interference

suppression to a stereo decoder (16).
Circuit arrangement according to Claim 1,
characterized in that the low-pass filter (3') has a

frequency response that is constant over a significant
part of the useful frequency range.
Circuit arrangement according to one of the
preceding claims, characterized in that the first

sampling rate is 456 kHz and the second sampling rate
is 228 kHz.
