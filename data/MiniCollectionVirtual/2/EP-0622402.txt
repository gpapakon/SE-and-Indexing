<ABSTRACT>
Vesiculated polymer beads are prepared in which a 
water-in-oil-in-water emulsion containing a cross-linkable 

polymer and a copolymerisable monomer in the oil phase is 
heated in the presence of an initiator to cure the polymer 

beads, wherein curing is commenced in a first stage in the 
presence of a substantially water-insoluble initiator and, 

when the beads are sufficiently stable, curing is completed 
in a second stage in the presence of an at least partially 

water-soluble initiator. Preferably, the completion of 
curing is carried out at a temperature higher than that of 

the first stage. The beads can be used in low odour paint 
formulations.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to vesiculated polymer beads and 
more particularly to multi-vesiculated polymer beads for use 
in coating compositions. The preparation of vesiculated polymer beads (granules) 
useful as opacifiers in coating compositions is the subject 
of an extensive technical and patent literature. In multi-vesiculated 
beads the structure of individual beads consists 
of a solid polymer matrix, formed usually from a cross-linked 
polymer, in which are incorporated numerous vesicles 
of an aqueous phase. A variety of polymer systems may be 
used to form such beaded structures, the one most commonly 
used commercially being that derived from polyester resins 
having a proportion of ethylenically unsaturated linkages 
which provide sites for cross-linking with a suitable 
copolymerisable unsaturated monomer. The basic process for the production of beaded 
structures of the above kind is well-known, having been 
described, for example, in International publication 
WO 81/01711. In outline, the process begins with the 
formation of a first emulsion in which an aqueous phase is 
emulsified in a mixture of the unsaturated polyester and the 
selected copolymerisable monomer, usually as a solution of 
the polyester in a liquid monomer. The resulting water-in-oil 
emulsion is hereinafter referred to as EM1. Where 
pigmented beads are desired it is convenient to disperse the 
pigment in the aqueous phase before forming the EM1 
emulsion. The EM1 emulsion is then itself emulsified at 
high shear into an aqueous phase to form a water-in-oil-in 
water emulsion in which the dispersed oil phase consists of 
globules of polyester/monomer of the desired size each 
containing numerous vesicles of the initial aqueous phase. 
To the resulting double emulsion, hereinafter referred to as 
EM2, a polymerising initiator typically of the free radical  
 
type is then added and the mixture subjected to curing 
conditions to cross-link the polyester and thereby fix or 
"freeze" the polymer in beaded form. The process conditions necessary for the production of 
satisfactory vesiculated polymer beads according to the 
basic process have been indicated in WO 81/01711, GB 
2,075,523, GB 1,491,011 and in other prior patents. Thus 
the types of polymer/copolymerisable monomer system which 
may be successfully utilised are now well established. It 
is also known that the acid value of the selected polyester 
should be within certain limits eg 5-50 mg KOH/g and that 
the process should be carried out in the presence of a 
suita
