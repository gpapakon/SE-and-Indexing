<ABSTRACT>
Known optical noise sources are equipped with a light source and an 
interference filter, optically coupled thereto and based on path length 

difference, for generating an optical composition signal. If the spectrum of a 
photodiode to be illuminated with the optical composition signal is to be as flat 

as possible, said path length difference must be considerably greater than the 
coherence length of the light source which in present practice leads to 

disadvantageously large path length differences. By feeding, according to the 
invention, a noise signal to the light source, the coherence length of the light 

source decreases, as a result of which it is sufficient to use considerably 
smaller path length differences.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to an optical noise source comprising
narrowband light source means for generating a modulated optical signal and
provided with a base input for receiving an electrical periodic signal for
modulating a narrowband optical signal, andan interference filter, based on path length difference, for receiving the
modulated optical signal and for generating an optical composition signal.Such an optical noise source is disclosed by an article "Measurement
of frequency response of photoreceivers using self-homodyne method", by J.
Wang, U. Kr√ºger, B. Schwarz and K. Petermann, from "ELECTRONICS
LETTERS" dated 25 May 1989, Volume 25, No. 11, pages 722, 723. This
mentions narrowband light source means which comprise a laser diode
(narrowband light source) for generating a narrowband optical signal. The
anode (base input) of the laser diode is fed with a sinusoidal current
(electrical periodic signal) with which the narrowband optical signal is
modulated. Said modulated optical signal is fed to an interference filter which
consists of two 3 dB couplers with, therebetween, two pieces of glass fibre
having a mutual path length difference of approximately 1 km. The
interference filter generates the optical composition signal which is composed
of two mutually different frequency-modulated signals. As soon as a
photodiode is illuminated with this optical composition signal, an electrical
photodiode noise signal is produced whose (electrical) noise bandwidth is
equal to the maximum instantaneous frequency difference between the two
optical signals. If the spectrum of the electrical photodiode noise signal is to
be as flat as possible within the chosen noise bandwidth (which is specified
with the amplitude of the electrical periodic signal), the path length 
difference on which the interference filter is based must be considerably
larger than the coherence length of the light source. Said coherence length,
for the present-generation laser diodes, for example, is 10 metres and may
increase to several kilometres for modern multi-section lasers.This known noise source has the drawback that the interference filter
needs to be based on a large path length difference (such as, for example, 1
kilometre).The object of the invention is, inter alia, to provide a noise source of
the type mentioned in the preamble, in which it is sufficient to use an interference
filter based on a considerably smaller path length difference (of, for
example, 10 metres).To this end, the noise source according to the invention is
chara
