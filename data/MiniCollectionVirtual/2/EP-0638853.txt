<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to reproduction apparatus, and more particularly, to an apparatus for
uniformly applying high frequency vibratory energy to an imaging surface for electrophotographic
applications with optimal energy transfer.Transfer of toner from a charge retentive surface to the final substrate is commonly
accomplished electrostatically. A developed toner image is held on the charge retentive surface
with electrostatic and mechanical forces. A substrate (such as a copy sheet) is brought into intimate
contact with the surface, sandwiching the toner thereinbetween. An electrostatic transfer charging
device, such as a corotron, applies a charge to the back side of the sheet, to attract the toner image
to the sheet.Unfortunately, the interface between the sheet and the charge retentive surface is not
always optimal. Particularly with non-flat sheets, such as sheets that have already passed through
a fixing operation such as heat and/or pressure fusing, or perforated sheets, or sheets that are
brought into imperfect contact with the charge retentive surface, the contact between the sheet and
the charge retentive surface may be non-uniform, characterized by gaps where contact has failed.
There is a tendency for toner not to transfer across these gaps. A copy quality defect results.That acoustic agitation or vibration of a surface can enhance toner release therefrom is
known, as described by US-A 4,111,546 to Maret, US-A 4,684,242 to Schultz, US-A 4,007,982 to
