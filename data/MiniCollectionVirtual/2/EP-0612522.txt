<ABSTRACT>
A therapy for reducing the risk of hypotension in 
a patient at risk of same. Pursuant to the present 

invention a composition is used that has a sufficiently 
reduced arginine content to reduce the nitric oxide 

formation in the patient. To provide an enteral 
composition for a patient at risk of hypotension. In an 

embodiment, the composition includes less than 
approximately 0.2% of the total calories as arginine. 

Preferably, the composition provides the necessary 
nutritional requirements to the patient.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates generally to
compositions for providing nutritional requirements to
a patient. More specifically, the present invention
relates to compositions for reducing the risk of
hypotension in patient at risk of same.A number of disease states may place a patient at
risk of hypotension. One such disease state is sepsis.Sepsis has been described as the systemic response
to infection. It is an increasingly common cause of
morbidity and mortality and has been reported to be the
most common cause of death in noncoronary intensive care
units. See, Definition for Sepsis and Organ Failure,
Critical Care Medicine, Vol. 20, No. 6, p. 864 et.seq.
(1992).Systemic inflammatory response syndrome describes
wide spread inflammation that occurs in patients with
such diverse disorders as infection, pancreatitis,
ischemia, multitrauma, hemorrhage shock, or
immunologically mediated organ injury. Sepsis is a
subcategory of the dysfunction. See, Definition for
Sepsis and Organ Failure, Critical Care Medicine, Vol.
20, No. 6, pp. 724-725.When systemic inflammatory response syndrome is due
to infection, the terms sepsis and systemic inflammatory
response syndrome are synonymous. A frequent
complication of systemic inflammatory response syndrome
is the development of organ system dysfunction. These
include conditions such as: acute lung injury; shock; 
renal failure; and multiple organ dysfunction syndrome.
Supra.Severe sepsis, which can lead to septic shock, is
sepsis associated with organ dysfunction, hypoperfusion,
or hypotension. Sepsis-induced hypotension is defined
by the presence of a systolic blood pressure of < 90 mmHg
or its reduction by â‰¥ 40 mmHg from the baseline, in the
absence of other causes for hypotension (e.g.,
cardiogenic shock). Septic shock is defined as sepsis
with hypotension along with the presence of perfusion
abnormalities. Supra.Large scale multicenter, sepsis studies, have
indicated that there is a continuum of severity that has
both infectious and inflammatory components. The
condition begins with infection that can lead to sepsis
with organ dysfunction and septic shock. Supra, citing:

<CLAIMS>
An enteral composition for providing nutrition to a patient having or at risk
of a chronic inflammation reaction, sepsis, or systemic inflammatory response

syndrome while meeting the nutritional requirements of the patient, the
composition comprising:


a protein source of which arginine provides less than 0.4% of the energy of
the composition;
a carbohydrate source; and
a lipid source.
A composition of claim 1 in which the protein source includes proteins that
are low in arginine.
A composition of claim 1 in which the protein source includes free amino
acids.
A composition of claim 1 in which half of the protein source is hydrolysed
whey and half is free amino acids.
A composition of any of claims 1 to 4 in which arginine provides 0.2% or
less of the energy of the composition.
A composition of claim 1 or claim 3 in which the protein source is free of
arginine.
A composition of any of claims 1 to 6 in which the enteral composition
includes citrulline and ornithine.
A composition of any of claims 1 to 6 in which the enteral composition
includes at least one arginine analog that competes for the enzyme nitric oxide

synthetase.
A composition of any of claims 1 to 8 in which the protein source provides
16% to 20% of the energy, the carbohydrate source provides 40 to 50% of the 

energy, the lipid source provides 30 to 40% of the energy, and vitamins and
minerals are provided to meet daily requirements in 6.3 kJ (1500 calories).
The use of a protein source which has reduced arginine content in the
preparation of an enteral composition for providing nutrition to a patient having

or at risk of a chronic inflammation reaction, sepsis, or systemic inflammatory
response syndrome, the arginine in the protein source providing less than 0.4% of

the energy of the composition to reduce nitric oxide formation in the patient and
the enteral composition including a carbohydrate source and a lipid source.
Use according to claim 10 in which the enteral composition is in
accordance with any of claims 2 to 9.
