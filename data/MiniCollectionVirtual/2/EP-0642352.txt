<ABSTRACT>
It has been discovered that it is possible to administer truncated tissue factor, not having the transmembrane region, (tTF) in combination with factor VIIa (FVIIa) or an activator of endogenous factor VII to treat bleeding disorders such as those resulting from hemophilia or cirrhosis of the liver. The tTF is administered to produce up to 10  mu g tTF/ml of plasma. The FVIIa or FVII activator is administered to produce levels of between 40 ng VIIa/ml and 700 ng FVIIa/ml of plasma. The effective dosages of both tTF and VIIa/factor VII activator are significantly and surprisingly less than the administration of either alone to stop bleeding. Examples demonstrate safety and efficacy in normal and hemophilic dogs.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a composition and
method for treatment of bleeding.The United States government has certain rights in
this invention by virtue of grant R01 HL 44225 awarded by
the National Institutes of Health to James H. Morrissey.
This is a continuation of U.S. Serial No. 08/021615
filed February 19, 1993, entitled, "Treatment of Bleeding
with Modified Tissue Factor In Combination with An
Activator of FVII" which is a continuation-in-part of U.S.
Serial No. 07/882,202 entitled "Treatment of Bleeding with
Modified Tissue Factor in Combination with FVIIa" filed
May 13, 1992, both by James H. Morrissey and Philip C.
Comp.Blood coagulation results from the production of
thrombin, a proteolytic enzyme inducing platelet
aggregation and cleaving fibrinogen to fibrin, which
stabilizes the platelet plug. A number of proenzymes and
procofactors circulating in the blood interact in this
process through several stages during which they are
sequentially or simultaneously converted to the activated
form, ultimately resulting in the activation of
prothrombin to thrombin by activated factor X (fXa) in the
presence of factor Va, ionic calcium, and platelets.Factor X can be activated by either of two pathways,
termed the extrinsic and intrinsic pathways. The
intrinsic pathway, or surface-mediated activation pathway,
consists of a series of reactions where a protein
precursor is cleaved to form an active protease, beginning 
with activation of factor XII to factor XIIa, which
converts factor XI to factor XIa, which, in the presence
of calcium, converts factor IX to factor IXa. Factors IX
and X can also be activated via the extrinsic pathway by
tissue factor (TF) in combination with activated factor
VII (factor VIIa; fVIIa). Activated factor IX, in the
presence of calcium, phospholipid (platelets), and factor
VIIIa, activates factor X to factor Xa.Physiologically, the major pathway involved in
coagulation is believed to be the extrinsic pathway, an
essential step of which is tissue factor-mediated
activation of factor VII to factor VIIa. Tissue factor is
an integral membrane glycoprotein having a protein and a
phospholipid component. It has been isolated from a
variety of tissues and species and reported to have a
molecular mass of between 42,000 and 53,000. DNA encoding
tissue factor and methods for expression of the protein
have now been reported, for example, in European Patent
Application 0 278 776 by Genentech, Inc. and by J. H.
Morrissey, et al. Cell 50, 129-135 (1987).The complex of factor VIIa

VIIa or an activator which promotes the conversion of

endogenous factor VII to factor VIIa, wherein the activator
is selected from the group consisting of factor Xa in

combination with phospholipid, factor IXa in combination
with phospholipid, thrombin, factor XIIa, and the FVII

activator from the venom of 
Oxyuranus scutellatus

in a dosage for administration to a patient in the amount

effective to produce a concentration of between 100 ng and
50 µg truncated tissue factor per milliliter of plasma and

said factor VIIa is in a dosage in an amount effective to
produce levels of between 20 ng and 10 µg factor VIIa per

milliliter of plasma.
The use of claim 1, wherein the pharmaceutical composition
further comprises a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier

and wherein said truncated tissue factor is in a concentration
of between 100 ng and 50 µg/ml of carrier and

wherein the factor VIIa activator which activates factor
VII to yield factor VIIa is in a concentration of between

1 and 10 µg/ml of carrier.
The use according to claim 1, wherein the truncated tissue
factor and factor VIIa are in a pharmaceutically acceptable

carrier for topical administration to a patient, and
the truncated tissue factor is in a concentration of

between 100 ng and 50 µg/ml of carrier and the factor VIIa
is in a concentration of between 1 and 10 µg/ml of

carrier.
The use of claim 4, wherein said truncated tissue factor
is in a concentration of between 10 and 50 µg/ml. 
The use of claims 1 to 5, wherein truncated tissue factor
has the amino acid sequence shown as SEQ ID NO:2.
The use of claim 1 wherein the activator is factor Xa in
a range of 12 to greater than 26 pmoles per kg body weight

in combination with phospholipid in a range of 19 pmoles
to greater than 40 pmoles per kg body weight.
The use of claims 1 to 7, wherein the pharmaceutical preparation
is formulated for systemical administration.
The use of claim 6, wherein truncated tissue factor and
FVIIa are used in an amount to produce levels of between

1 and 10 µg tTf/ml plasma and between 40 ng and 4 µg
VIIa/ml plasma.
The use of claims 1 to 7, wherein the pharmaceutical preparation
