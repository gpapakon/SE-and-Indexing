<ABSTRACT>
A reference range of tightening torques is 
predetermined relative to the rotation angle of a 

threaded member as tightened up normally. In tightening 
up a nut on an externally threaded member, the 

tightening torque is detected by a torque sensor 
every time the nut is rotated through a specified 

angle, and whether the tightening torque relative to 
the rotation angle is within the reference range is 

judged by a microcomputer. The result of judgment 
is indicated by a light-emitting diode and a buzzer.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a threaded member tightening
method, for example, for use in fastening the components
of a pipe joint together with a nut.Pipe joints are already known which comprise a first tubular
joint member having a hexagonal flange and an externally
threaded portion, a second tubular joint member disposed end
to end therewith, an annular gasket interposed between the
opposed end faces of the two joint members, a nut provided
on the second joint member and screwed on the first joint
member and a thrust bearing provided between the second
joint member and the nut.With the pipe joint, a fluid-tight connection is provided by
manually tightening the nut on the first joint member first
and thereafter tightening up the nut with a tool with the
hexagonal flange of the first joint member held with another
tool. To tighten up the nut suitably, there are known different
methods in the prior art.EP-0 480 380 A2 discloses a method of tightening a threaded
fastener, in which the tightening torque and the tightening
angle are measured during the last part of the tightening
process and compared with a specification window defined by
a high torque limit, a low torque limit, a high angle limit
and a low angle limit. In this window the desired or optimal
torque and angle values are assumed to occur exactly at the
center of the window.Comparing the method values with the reference range defined
by this final target window allows adjustment of the tightening 
process in such a way, that the target values in the
center of that window are quite exactly attained.However, the known method is not capable of recognizing
faulty tightening conditions. For example, when during the
assembling of a pipe joint worker forgets to install a gasket
or a thrust bearing, the conventional method is unable
to indicate the absence of the gasket of thrust bearing, giving
rise to the problem of a leak from the joint portion of
piping due to inproper tightening.In order to solve this problem, EP-A-0 285 815 suggests,
that one should contineously detect the torque applied to
the fastener and the rotation angle of the threaded member
to detect a too rapid increase in the torque applied to the
fastener, i. e. a faulty tightening condition.Moreover, WO-A-91/01198 suggests, that one should increase
the tightening torque in predetermined interation steps and
judging whether a detected scope of the tightening torque falls
within a predetermined reference range defining a desired
tightening condition.However, the known methods have

A method of tightening a threaded member (36) while repeatedly
detecting, from the beginning to the end of the

tightening process, both the tightening torque applied
to the threaded member (36) and its displacement, and

judging whether the detected tightening torque falls
within a predetermined reference range in relation to

the displacement, wherein either the amount of the tightening
torque applied to the threaded member (36) or its

displacement is increased in predetermined iteration
steps and wherein a plurality of reference ranges is determined

to define allowable deviations from a reference
line of the tightening torque, which inc
reases in a linear
relation with the displacement in a first portion

and then in a linear relation in a second portion of the
tightening process, with the slope of the reference line

being different in the two portions, for continuously
detecting during the tightening process faulty tightening

value is not within allowable range in any step,

the threaded member (36) is reversely rotated on the

member (36), and the value of tightening torque is
calculated from the current value of the motor (19). 
A method of tightening a threaded member (36) while repeatedly
detecting, from the beginning to the end of the

range in relation to the displacement, wherein either
the amount of the tightening torque applied to the

threaded member (36) or its displacement is increased in
predetermined iteration steps for continuously detecting

during the tightening process faulty tightening conditions
and wherein at least two reference ranges are determined

each defining allowable deviations from a reference
value of the slope, each range being used as predetermined

reference range in a different portion of the
tightening process with the reference value of the slope
