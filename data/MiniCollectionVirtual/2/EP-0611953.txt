<ABSTRACT>
A length measuring apparatus that uses an ultrasonic 
magnetostrictive delay line can detect a position with high 

accuracy by utilizing a reflected wave positively. In a 
measuring apparatus using an ultrasonic magnetostrictive delay 

line in which a wave transmitter (4) is disposed at one end of 
an ultrasonic magnetostrictive delay line (1), and the other end 

of the ultrasonic magnetostrictive delay line (1) is made an 
open end, a detecting coil (3) is wound around the outer 

periphery of the ultrasonic magnetostrictive delay line (1) over 
the whole area of the measuring range, a magnet piece (2) is 

disposed so as to become slidable along the ultrasonic 
magnetostrictive delay line (1) an a position of the magnet 

piece (2) is measured on the basis of a delay time of a 
detection pulse (
B
) produced in the detection coil (3) relative 
to a drive pulse (
A
) applied to the wave transmitter (4), a 
period (T‚ÇÅ) of the drive pulse (
A
) applied to the wave 
transmitter (4) is matched with a time in which a reflected wave 

(
C
) is generated at the ultrasonic magnetostrictive delay line 
(1) at its one end in which the wave transmitter (4) is 

disposed.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a length measuring
apparatus employing an ultrasonic magnetostrictive delay line
for use in measuring a level surface of a gasoline in a gasoline
tank, detecting a piston rod stroke when assembled into a
hydraulic cylinder or detecting positions of movable parts of a
variety of industrial machines and so on.Length measuring apparatus that have hitherto been
proposed use an ultrasonic magnetostrictive delay line whose
length is extended or reduced with the application of a magnetic
field. In the conventional length measuring apparatus, a non-reflection
supporting member made of a shock-absorbing material,
such as a rubber or the like, is attached to respective or one
end portion of the ultrasonic magnetostrictive delay line in
order to damp an undesired reflected wave generated by
ultrasonic vibration.In the above conventional length measuring apparatus
using the ultrasonic magnetostrictive delay line, however, it is
difficult to damp the undesired reflected wave completely.
Thus, reflected ultrasonic waves cross each other to interfere
with a detection pulse so that the detection pulse is disturbed.
There is then the disadvantage that position cannot be detected
with high accuracy.Further, if strong ultrasonic vibration were generated 
in order to obtain a stable and large detection pulse, it
would become impossible to damp reflected waves and to
dissipate the reflected waves gradually.Furthermore, even when the undesired reflected wave is
completely removed by using the non-reflection supporting
member as described above, it is unavoidable that the whole
of the length measuring apparatus becomes large in size due
to the provision of the non-reflecting supporting member.An alternative length measuring apparatus is disclosed
in EP-A-0363517. This apparatus comprises an amorphous
metal strip, a first pulse injection coil disposed at one
end of the strip, a detection coil wound around the strip
and a magnet located adjacent the strip and moveable
relative to the strip. The other end of the strip spaced
from the pulse injection coil may be either open or provided
with a second pulse ejection coil. With the other end
provided with a second injection coil, both the first and
second injection coils generate a pulse, both pulses being
used to provide an indication of the distance of the magnet
from the end of the strip. With the other end open, a pulse
generated by the first pulse ejection coil is reflected from
the open end, the generated pulse being used to provide an
indicatio

A length measuring apparatus comprising:

an ultrasonic magnetostrictive delay line (1);
a wave transmitter (4) provided at one end of said
ultrasonic magnetostrictive delay line (1), the other end of

said ultrasonic wave magnetostrictive delay line (1) being
open;
a detection coil (3) wound around the outer periphery
of said ultrasonic magnetostrictive delay line (1) over the

whole area of the range to be measured;
a magnet (2) slidably disposed along the length of said
ultrasonic magnetostrictive delay line (1);
a drive pulse generator (5,9) for generating a drive
pulse, the drive pulse being supplied to said wave

transmitter (4) so as to cause an ultrasonic wave to
propagate through said ultrasonic magnetostrictive delay

line (1) and be reflected from said open end as a reflected

means (7) for measuring the position of said magnet (2)
from said one end of said ultrasonic magnetostrictive delay

line (1) on the basis of the delay time of a detection pulse
relative to said drive pulse, the detection pulse being

generated in said detection coil (3) by said magnet (2) in
response to said drive pulse applied to said wave

transmitter (4); characterised by
phase matching means (8,9) for matching at said one end
of said delay line the phase of said transmitted ultrasonic

wave with the phase of said reflected wave by making the
period of said transmitted ultrasonic wave coincident with

the period of said reflected wave when said reflected wave
reaches said one end of said delay line, thereby

synchronizing the reflected wave with the transmitted wave
at said one end of said delay line.
A length measuring apparatus according to claim 1,
further comprising reflected wave detecting means (8) which

detects occurrence of said reflected wave at the said one 
end of said delay line.
A length measuring apparatus according to claim 2,
further comprising means (7) for calculating a ratio between

a time from said drive pulse to the next drive pulse and a
time from said drive pulse to said detection pulse and means
