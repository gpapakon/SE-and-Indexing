<ABSTRACT>
A striped and celled Venetian blind slat is made of a poly carbonate material 
mixed with the additives such as water, PE-wax, barium sulfate (BaSO4), 

Calcium carbonate (CaCO3), talc, antimony (III) Oxide (Sb203), and acrylic 
compounds. The mixture is extruded by an extruder at a temperature ranging 

between 200 and 300 degrees in Celsius. The extruded mixture is foamed and 
is then formed in a vacuum mold into the slat of uneven thickness and having 

irregular stripes (24) and cells (25).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates generally to slats of a Venetian 
blind, and more particularly to the Venetian blind slats, which are 
striped and celled and which are made of a synthetic plastic material. As shown in FIGS. 1 and 2 , the slats 10 of a conventional 
Venetian blind is made of PVC material by extrusion, molding and 
cooling. Such conventional slats 10 are therefore provided with a flat 
and smooth surface and with a cross section of uniform thickness. 
Without an additional finishing work, the slats 10 are generally devoid 
of any streak. The conventional slats 10 described above are by no means 
defective functionally. In other words, the slats 10 can be set together 
at any angle to regulate the light and the air passing through or be 
drawn up together to the top of the window by means of cords, so as to 
achieve the expected effects of safeguarding the privacy and decorating 
the room. However, in view of the fact that the molecular organization  
 
of the slats 10 is intensive and uniform, the slats 10 have the 
following shortcomings that are described hereinafter. The production cost of the slats 10 is relatively high in view 
of the fact that the weight per unit of the slats 10 is so increased 
as to result in a relative increase in the quantity of the material 
that is used to make the slats 10. The molecular organization of the slat 10 is so intensive that 
the combustibility of the slat 10 is greatly increased. As a result, 
the slat 10 is a potential fire hazard. The slat 10 is flat, uniform in thickness, devoid of artistic 
stripes and monotonous in appearance. As a result, the aesthetic 
effect of the slat 10 is compromised. The slat 10 is a potential pollutant of the environment in view 
of the fact that the slat 10 is made of polyvinyl chloride (PVC), 
which is potentially toxic. It is therefore the primary objective of the present invention 
to provide the improved slats of a Venetian blind, which overcome all 
the shortcomings of the conventional slats of a Venetian blind 
described above. It is another objective of the present invention to provide a 
low-cost method of making the striped, celled and lightweight Venetian 
blind slats of synthetic plastic material. It is still another objective of the present invention to provide 
the striped and celled Venetian blind slats of synthetic plastic 
material, which are immune to a continuous heat conduction and are 
therefore resistant to fire. It is still another objective of the present invention to provide 
the striped and

<CLAIMS>
A striped and celled Venetian blind slat of synthetic plastic 
material and having on the surface thereof a plurality of irregular 

and rough stripes, said slat having a cross section of irregular and 
uneven thickness, said cross section comprising a plurality of cells. 
The striped and celled Venetian blind slat of claim 1 wherein 
said slat is made of a poly carbonate plastic material, which has a 

specification of MI ranging between 5 and 20, and which is allowed to 
absorb water molecule for six to ten hours in an environment containing 

a relative humidity ranging between 50% and 70% before said poly 
carbonate plastic material is extruded by an extruder at a temperature 

ranging between 200 and 300 degrees in Celsius so as to become a raw 
slat
, which is then foamed by said water molecule and is formed 
subsequently into said slat in a vacuum mold in which a constant 

temperature is kept , with said slat having thereon a plurality of 
irregular stripes and having therein a plurality of cells containing 

said water molecule. 
The striped and celled Venetian blind slat of claim 1 wherein 
said slat is made of a poly carbonate plastic material, which has a 

specification of MI ranging between 5 and 20 and which is mixed with a 
plurality of additives having a boiling point ranging between 80 and 

180 degrees in Celsius, so as to form a mixture, which is then extruded 
by an extruder at a temperature ranging between 200 and 300 degrees in 

Celsius to become a raw slat, which is then foamed by said additives 
and is formed subsequently into said slat in a vacuum mold in which a 

constant temperature is kept, with said slat having thereon a plurality 
of irregular stripes and having therein a plurality of cells.
