<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a heating cabinet for the production of thermoformed plastic shafts, in particular for making prostheses. For the production of thermoformed plastic shafts of largely constant wall thickness, the following features are proposed.   a) a thermoforming insert (11) which is designed approximately in the form of a funnel and can be fixed upright in the cabinet inner space (3); b) the thermoforming insert (11) is designed as an air-ducting device, its lower opening, having the smallest diameter, defining the air inlet cross-section, and its upper opening, having the largest diameter, defining the air outlet cross-section; c) the thermoforming insert (11) has directly above its upper air outlet opening a panel holder (15) for the approximately horizontal receiving of a plastic panel (17) to be thermoformed; d) an air duct (4, 5, 6) which conducts the air in closed circulation and has at least one upper air extraction opening (5), which extracts from the cabinet inner space (3) in particular the air emerging from the thermoforming insert (11) and to which there is connected an air-diverting channel (4), which is arranged outside the cabinet inner space (3), has an air-circulating fan (7) and a heater (8), heating the extracted air, and is connected to at least one lower air blow-in opening (6), which opens out in to the cabinet inner space (3).

Heating cabinet for producing deep-drawn 
plastics shafts, in particular for constructing 

prostheses, characterised by the following features: 

a) a deep-drawing insert (11) which can be fixed 
upright in the cabinet interior (3) and which is 

formed so as to be substantially funnel-shaped; 
b) the deep-drawing insert (11) is formed as an air-conducting 
device, with its lower opening, which 

has the smallest diameter, defining the air inlet 
cross section and its upper opening, which has the 

largest diameter, defining the air outlet cross 
section; 
c) the deep-drawing insert (11) has, directly above 
its upper air outlet opening, a plate receiver 

(15) for receiving in a substantially horizontal 
manner a plastics slab (17) which is to be deep-drawn; 
d) an air guide (4, 5, 6) which guides the air in 
closed circuit and has at least one upper air 

suction opening (5), in particular one which 
removes by
 suction out of the cabinet interior (3) 
the air that is emerging from the deep-drawing 

insert (11) and to which is connected an air-return 
channel (4) which is arranged outside the 

cabinet interior (3), has a circulating air blower 
(7) and also a heating system (8) heating the air 

removed by suction and is connected to at least 
one lower air-injection opening (6) which leads 

into the cabinet interior (3). 
Heating cabinet according to claim 1, 
characterised in that the deep-drawing insert (11) is 

inserted into a corresponding recess (10) of a plug-in 
unit (9) which can be plugged into the cabinet interior 

(3). 
Heating cabinet according to claim 2,  
 

characterised in that the air-suction opening (5) is 
arranged above the plug-in unit (9) and the air-injection 

opening (6) is arranged below the plug-in 
unit (9). 
Heating cabinet according to claim 3, 
characterised in that also provided above the plug-in 

unit (9) there is at least one air-injection opening 
(18) which can be selectively closed by way of an air 

control. 
Heating cabinet according to one of the 
preceding claims, characterised in that a clamping 

frame (16), in which is installed the plastics slab 
(17) that is to be deep-drawn, is inserted into the 

plate receiver (15) of the deep-drawing insert (11).
