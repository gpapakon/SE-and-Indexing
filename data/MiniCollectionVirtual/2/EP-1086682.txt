<ABSTRACT>
The derivatives of aryl(or heteroaryl)azolylcarbinol (I), in which R1 is an
atom of hydrogen or a lower alkyl group; R2 is a dialkylaminoalkyl or

azaheterocyclylalkyl radical; Ar is a phenyl or thienyl radical, optionally substituted;
and Het is a heterocyclic five-membered azotic aromatic ring that contains from

one to three nitrogen atoms, optionally substituted, are suitable for the treatment of
neurogenic inflammation, present in different processes, such as diabetes,

asthma, cystitis, gingivitis, migraine, dermatitis, rhinitis, psoriasis, inflammation of
sciatic and lumbar nerves, gastrointestinal processes, ocular inflammation, etc., in

mammals, including man.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to the use of some derivatives of aryl(or
heteroaryl)azolylcarbinols of general formula (I), as well as their physiologically
acceptable salts, in the manufacture of medicaments, useful in human and/or
veterinary therapy, for the treatment of neurogenic inflammation present in
different processes such as: diabetes, asthma, cystitis, gingivitis, migraine,
dermatitis, rhinitis, psoriasis, inflammation of sciatic and lumbar nerves,
gastrointestinal processes, and ocular inflammation.Neurogenic inflammation is present in very different pathologic conditions,
and is characterised by vasodilatation and plasmatic extravasation in zones where
non-myelinated fibres can be found. The activation of these fibres frees the
mediating substances P and calcitonin gene related peptide (CGRP) from the
afferent nerve terminals provoking the characteristic symptoms of neurogenic
inflammation [GYORFI, A. et al., J. Clin. Periodontol. 19(10): 731-736 (1992)].
The substance P plays an important role as the main mediator in the induction of
neurogenic inflammation by means of an increase in the vascular permeability due
to the liberation of histamine from mast cells and by interaction with the endothelial
cells [INOUE, H. et al., Inflamm. Res. 44: 125-130 (1995); PIOTROWSKI, W. et
al., Br. J. Dermatol. 114: 37-46 (1986); LOWMAN, M.A. et al., Br. J. Pharmacol.
95: 121-130 (1988); FEWTRELL, C.M.S. et al., J. Physiol. 330: 393-411 (1982);
STEPHENSON, J. A. et al., Eur. J. Pharmacol. 124: 377-378 (1986); ZICHE, M. et
al., Microvas. Res. 40: 264-278 (1990)]. It has also been reported that CGRP can
promote the plasmatic extravasation induced by substance P in rat trachea and
therefore plays an important role in the modulation of neurogenic inflammation in
the respiratory tract [BROKAW, J.J. et al., Lung 170(2): 85-93 (1992)]. The
neuropeptides (CGRP and substance P, among others) are found in the primary
non-myelinated afferent neurones as neurotransmitters [HOLZER, P., 
Neuroscience 24: 739-768 (1988)]. Neurogenic inflammation, with reflex
vasodilatation of the axon, plasmatic and edema extravasation, can be produced
by neuropeptides by means of the activation of primary afferent neurones. In fact,
the cutaneous inflammatory responses, including the formation of edema,
vasodilatation and wheals, are evoked as response to intradermic injection of
neuropeptides [GAMSE, R. et al., Eur. J. Pharmacol. 114: 61-66 (1985); FULLER,
R.W. et al., Br. J. Pharmacol. 92: 781-788 (1987)]. Furthermore, nueropeptides
