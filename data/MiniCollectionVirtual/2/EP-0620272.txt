<ABSTRACT>
We have found that gellan gum can be used as a fining
agent for beer and wine manufacturing processes. Gellan gum can be

used for clarifying beer prior to fermentation. Gellan gum can also be
used for fining matured beer or wine, either prior to or during final

packaging in bottles, cans or barrels.

<DESCRIPTION>
The greater part of the haze in fermentation products such 
as beer and wine is removed by conventional means, but perfect clarity 
requires an auxiliary fining agent. The removal of proteinaceous 
material from beer, wines and fortified wines is obtained by fining 
and/or filtration processes. Fining agents are used to associate with the 
protein and form a precipitate which rapidly falls to the bottom of the 
storage vessel as a dense floc which can then be removed. There are 2 
stages where fining agents may be used: (1) prior to fermentation and 
(2) after maturation. Beer, for example, can be clarified and stabilized by 
treating it with a carrageenan solution before carbonation. 
Carrageenan, a seaweed extract that will naturally vary in performance, 
precipitates the nitrogenous bodies that cause cloudiness and turbidity, 
so that they can be filtered in the normal way. Sodium alginate has also found an important use in this 
field, where its convenience in handling and low cost mean only a low 
additional expense in producing a brilliant beer, also known as "bright" 
beer. The use of sodium alginate for clarification of wine has been 
investigated extensively. It has been shown that removal of not only the 
tannins and coloring materials but also nitrogenous substances, as 
evidenced by the decrease in total nitrogen in the wine, can be achieved 
by treatment with sodium alginate. The mechanism of the reaction 
appears to be due to the hydrolysis of sodium alginate in the highly 
acidic wine to give sodium ions and an insoluble precipitate of alginic 
acid salts of iron and copper. Isinglass, a collagen based material derived from the swim 
bladder of the sturgeon, is an effective fining agent in beer 
manufacture. However, Isinglass is very expensive and the supply is 
quite limited.  We have found that gellan gum can be used as a fining 
agent for beer and wine manufacturing processes. Gellan gum can be 
used for clarifying beer prior to fermentation. Gellan gum can also be 
used for fining matured beer or wine, either prior to or during final 
packaging in bottles, cans or barrels. Preferably, gellan gum is used at a concentration level of 
1.0 ppm to 100 ppm in either the prefermented liquid or the fermented 
beer or wine product. Also preferably, a 0.1% gellan gum solution is 
prepared in 0.05% sodium citrate stock solution made with deionized 
water, in order to prehydrate the gum. Gellan gum is a heteropolysaccharide prepared 
by fermentation of Pseudomonas elodea ATCC 31461. Aptly,
