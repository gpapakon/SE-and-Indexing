<ABSTRACT>
Novel polyiodinated compounds having a single molecular weight, a molecular iodine concentration higher than around 20 wt %, and particularly higher than around 30 wt %, at least nine iodine atoms, and a molecular weight of 2000-50,000, particularly 2000-20,000. Said compounds have zero overall electric charge or two anionic charges, and remain in a vascular compartment at a level of at least 30 wt % of the injected dose five minutes after intravascular administration to a patient.
