<ABSTRACT>
An ink jet apparatus applies a drive voltage to 
electrodes formed on portions of side walls made of 

piezoelectric ceramics and varies the internal volumes of 
grooves adjacent to the side walls using the action of a 

deformation produced by a piezoelectric thickness/slip 
effect of the piezoelectric ceramics. Thereby, ink stored 

inside the grooves is ejected. According to such an ink 
jet apparatus, a void ratio of the piezoelectric ceramic 

is 10% or less, and an average crystal grain diameter of 
the piezoelectric ceramics is 10µm or less. Further, a 

variation in a ratio d₁₅/S
E44
 of a piezoelectric constant 
d₁₅ of the piezoelectric ceramic to an elastic compliance 

S
E44
 thereof between the side walls falls within 4. A 
ratio H/W of a 
height H of each side wall to a width W 
thereof ranges from above 2 to below 9, and a ratio 

d₁₅/S
E44
 of a piezoelectric constant d₁₅ of the 
piezoelectric ceramic to an elastic compliance S
E44
 
thereof is 10 or more. It is thus possible to provide an 

ink jet apparatus having excellent durability and high 
reliability.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an ink jet
apparatus and, particularly, to a void ratio and an
average crystal grain diameter of piezoelectric ceramics.Known printer heads include drop-on-demand type
ink jet printer heads that utilize piezoelectric ceramics.
In these drop-on-demand type ink jet printer heads, the
volume of the ink chambers (ink channels) is varied by the
deformation of a piezoelectric ceramic. The deformation
thereby jets or ejects ink stored in the ink chambers from
nozzles as droplets due to a reduction in the volume of
the ink chamber. The deformation also causes ink to be
introduced into the ink chambers from other ink
introduction paths due to an increase in the volume. In
print heads using such an ink ejecting device or jet
apparatus, ink jet mechanisms are disposed adjacent to
each other and droplets of ink are ejected from the ink
jet mechanism located at a desired position according to
desired print data. Thus, desired characters and images
are formed on a sheet or the like disposed in opposing
relationship to the ink jet mechanism.Such an ink jet apparatus is known, for example, in
US-A-4879568, US-A-4887100 and US-A-5016028, upon which the
precharacterising portion of appended claim 1 is based.
Figs. 7, 8, 9 and 10 of this application are schematic
views showing conventional examples, respectively.The structure of the conventional example will be
specifically described below with reference to Fig. 7
showing a cross-sectional view of the ink jet apparatus.
The ink jet apparatus comprises a plurality of side walls
11 and a plurality of ink chambers 12 spaced away from
each other in the transverse direction. The ink chambers
12 are formed by bonding a piezoelectric ceramic plate 1
subjected to polarization processing in the direction
indicated by the arrow 4 to a cover plate 2 composed of a 
ceramic material or a resinous material or the like with
adhesive layers 3 of an epoxy adhesive or the like
interposed therebetween. Each of the ink chambers 12 has
a rectangular cross-section and is shaped in an elongated
manner. Each of the side walls 11 extends over the
overall length of each ink chamber 12. Metal electrodes
13 used for application of drive electric fields are
formed on both surfaces, each extending from the upper
portion adjacent to each adhesive layer 3 of each side
wall 11 to the central portion thereof. All of the ink
chambers are filled with ink during operation.The operation of the conventional example will now
be described with reference to Fig. 8 showing a
cross-s
