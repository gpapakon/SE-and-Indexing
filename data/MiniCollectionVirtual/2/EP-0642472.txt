<ABSTRACT>
The invention provides a method for removing sulphur compounds from water which contains low levels of organic matter, by anaerobic reduction of the sulphur compounds to sulphide, followed by partial oxidation of the sulphide to elementary sulphur. The cost-increasing consumption of electron donor (nutrient) during the anaerobic reduction is lowered by one or more of the following measures: a1) keeping the sulphate concentration in the anaerobic effluent at at least 500 mg/l; a2) keeping the sulphite concentration in the anaerobic effluent at at least 100 mg/l; b) keeping the salt concentration, expressed in sodium ion equivalents, in the anaerobic medium at at least 3 g/l; c) keeping the sulphide concentration in the anaerobic influent at at least 100 mg/l; d) introducing an inhibitor into the anaerobic treatment medium, which inhibitor is more toxic to the methane-producing bacteria than to incompletely oxidising sulphate-reducing bacteria or sulphate-reducing bacteria oxidising compounds having one carbon atom.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a process for removing sulphur compounds
from water.The presence of sulphur compounds in water is usually an
unacceptable factor. In the case of sulphate, sulphite and thiosulphate,
the principal drawbacks are attack on the sewer, eutrophication and
silting. In addition, heavy metals, which are particularly undesired
because of their toxic properties, are frequently also present in water
containing a large amount of sulphur compounds. One type of effluent in
which sulphur compounds, in particular sulphite, are a constituent which
is difficult to remove is the wash water from flue gas treatment plants.
The flue gases from power stations and waste incinerators cause extensive
pollution of the environment due to the presence of acidifying sulphur
dioxide (SO2). The harmful effects of acidification on forests, water,
buildings etc. are generally known. Other types of effluents containing
sulphur compounds are those originating from the printing industry,
mining industry, and paper, rubber, leather and viscose industry.In broad terms two types of method are available for the removal
of sulphur-containing compounds, that is to say physicochemical methods
and biological methods.The physicochemical treatment methods include precipitation, ion
exchange and membrane filtration (electrodialysis and reverse osmosis).
Disadvantages of such methods are tie high costs and the large stream of
waste which results. In the case of flue gas treatment, absorption on
lime or ammonia is usually employed. In this case large amounts of gypsum
or ammonium sulphate are formed, which may be partly re-used. However,
particularly in the case of gypsum the possible applications are becoming
ever fewer because the quality demands for gypsum are becoming ever more
stringent and the market for gypsum is becoming saturated.In the case of a biological treatment, sulphate and sulphite and
other sulphur compounds are reduced in an anaerobic step to give
sulphide, which in turn can be oxidised to elementary sulphur. Such
processes are known, for example from International patent application
WO 91/16269 and European patent application 451922. JP-A-59-19595
discloses an anaerobic treatment of dithionate-containing effluent
wherein a BOD source and a halomethane are added and generated H2S is
removed because this otherwise would inhibit anaerobic degradation of 
thionate.The advantage of such a method is that only small waste streams
remain because the sulphur formed can be reused. However, the disadvantage
is that,
