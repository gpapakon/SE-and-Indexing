<ABSTRACT>
A counterbalanced window operator includes a housing in 
which a rotatable lead screw (5) rotated by a crank 

handle (6) or an electric power unit (11), cooperates 
with a non-rotatable nut member (4) to axially displace 

the nut member and move pivoting arms (2,3) to open and 
close the window.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a window having
a main frame, particularly a rectangular main frame, and
a sash, particularly a rectangular sash, mounted for
pivoting movement relative to the main frame about a
pivot axis substantially parallel to a pair of opposed
sides of said sash, in combination with a window
operator for opening and closing said sash with respect
to said main frame, the operator comprising at least one
arm connected in a first end with one of said opposed
sides of the sash and mounted for pivoting about a pivot
point which is stationary with respect to said main
frame and means for moving said arm about the pivot
point, said moving means comprising a rotatable elongate
screw member journaled for rotation and having an axis
which is arrestable with respect to said main frame,
means for preventing axial displacement of said screw
member with respect to said main frame, and a non-rotatable
nut member operatively connected through a
link member with said arm at a point intermediate said
first and second ends thereof and engaged by said screw
member to be axially displaced by said screw member upon
rotation of said screw member, whereby to cause said arm
to pivot about said pivot point, said link member
comprising a first arm member rigidly connected with
said nut member and a second arm member, one end of
which is linked for pivotal connection with said first
arm member, whereas the other end of said second arm
member is linked for pivotal connection with said at
least one arm.Operators for opening and closing such windows or
similar devices are known, e.g. from AU-B-428 047, and
may be used for moving the window between closed and
open positions. When used in combination with a window 
such as a window having a stationary main frame mounted
in a roof of a house or other building, especially a
sloped roof, and a sash hinged to the main frame at the
top of the sash for pivoting toward and away from the
main frame, such operators are typically mounted on a
bottom member of the main frame and connected to a
bottom member of the sash for pushing the sash away from
the main frame and drawing the sash into engagement with
the main frame. When the window operator is actuated,
in such an installation, to move the window in an
opening direction, it must overcome a component of the
weight of the window, especially when the window is
mounted in a roof. In order to overcome this difficulty,
counterbalancing devices employing springs have been
provided to counteract the weight component of the
wind

<CLAIMS>
A window having a main frame, particularly a
rectangular main frame, and a sash, particularly a

rectangular sash, mounted for pivoting movement relative
to the main frame about a pivot axis substantially

parallel to a pair of opposed sides of said sash, in
combination with a window operator for opening and

closing said sash with respect to said main frame, the
operator comprising:


at least one arm (12,13) connected in a first end
with one of said opposed sides of the sash and mounted

for pivoting about a pivot point which is stationary
with respect to said main frame; and
means for moving said arm about the pivot point,
said moving means comprising a rotatable elongate screw

member (15) journaled for rotation and having an axis
which is arrestable with respect to said main frame,

means for preventing axial displacement of said screw
member (15) with respect to said main frame, and a non-rotatable

nut member (14) operatively connected through
a link member (17) with said arm (12,13) at a point

intermediate said first and second ends thereof and
engaged by said screw member (15) to be axially displaced

by said screw member upon rotation of said screw
member, whereby to cause said arm (12,13) to pivot about

said pivot point,

said link member (17) comprising a first arm member
rigidly connected with said nut member and a second arm

member, one end of which is linked for pivotal
connection with said first arm member, whereas the

other end of said second arm member is linked for
pivotal connection with said at least one arm (12,13), 
characterized
 in that said pivotal connections are
provided by link means (17c) permitting movement of said

at least one arm about a further axis substantially 
perpendicular to the axis of said screw member, and that

means (20a-20d) is provided for adjusting the axis of
said screw member (15) with respect to said main frame

in a plane perpendicular to said further axis, and
counterbalancing means being operatively connected
between said main frame and said arm for counteracting

a weight component of the window.
A window as claimed in claim 1, 
characterized

in that said moving means comprises a manually
manipulatable member (16) connected to said screw member

for manual rotation of said screw member.
A window as claimed in claim 1, 
characterized

in that said moving means further comprises an electrically
powered drive unit (M) connected to said screw

member (15) for rotating said screw member.
A window as claimed in claim 1, 2 or 3, 
characterized

in that said first end of said at least one arm
(12,13) is adapted for sliding connection with the sash

of the window, whereas said pivot point is located at
a second end of said arm.
A window as claimed in any of claims 1 to 4, 
characterized
 in that said screw member (15) comprises
a threaded spindle and said nut member (14) comprising

a head member with a threaded bore engaged by said
spindle.
A window as claimed in any of claims 1 to 5, 
characterized
 by comprising two of said arms (12,13).
A window as claimed in any of claims 1 to 6, 
characterized
 in that said counterbalancing means
comprises a torsion spring (18) secured about a stationary

pin (20) on said main frame, said torsion spring
having a finger (19) engaging each said arm (12,13).
A window as claimed in any of the preceding
claims, 
characterized
 in that said link means (17c) comprises
spherical joints at both ends of said second arm.
