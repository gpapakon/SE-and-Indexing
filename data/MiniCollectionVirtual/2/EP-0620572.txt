<ABSTRACT>
An element (E) of a structure taking full advantage 
of properties of artificial metallic superlattices 

exhibits a very large magnetoresistive effect in a very 
small magnetic field at room temperature. This element (E) 

includes a plurality of, for example three, laminates (L) 
deposited one above the other. A nonmagnetic metallic 

layer (14) is interposed between neighboring laminates (L) 
to weaken a magnetic coupling between the neighboring 

laminates (L). Each of the laminates (L) includes a first 
magnetic thin layer (11a) having a thickness of 5 to 100Å, 

a nonmagnetic metallic thin layer (12) having a thickness 
of 5 to 100Å and deposited on the first magnetic thin layer 

(11a), a second magnetic thin layer (11b) having a thickness 
of 5 to 100Å and deposited on the nonmagnetic metallic 

thin layer (12), and an antiferromagnetic layer (13) having 
a thickness of 10 to 100Å and deposited on the second 

magnetic thin layer (11b).

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to an element having magnetoresistive effect comprising a
first magnetic thin layer, a nonmagnetic metallic thin layer deposited on said first
magnetic thin layer, a second magnetic thin layer deposited on said nonmagnetic
metallic thin layer, and an antiferromagnetic layer deposited on said second magnetic
thin layer.Such a structure is known from Journal of Magnetism and Magnetic Materials 93,
p101, 1991, and Journal of Magnetism and Magnetic Materials 121,
(1993) March II, No. 3, pages 386-389. The present invention particularly relates to an element
which can be employed
in a magnetoresistance sensor, a magnetoresistance head or
the like.In developing magnetoresistance sensors (hereinafter
referred to as MR sensors) or magnetoresistance heads
(hereinafter referred to as MR heads) employing a
magnetoresistive element, permalloys of Ni0.8 Fe0.2 or alloy
films of Ni0.8Co0.2 have been primarily used for magnetic
materials. These materials having magnetoresistive effect
generally exhibit a ratio of change of magnetoresistivity
(hereinafter referred to as MR ratio) of about 2.5%. There
is an increasing demand for the development of materials
having a large MR ratio in order to obtain a high-sensitivity
magnetoresistive element. It was discovered and
disclosed several years ago in "Physical Review Letters
(Vol. 61, p2472, 1988)" and "Physical Review Letters (Vol.
64, p2304, 1990)" that a giant magnetoresistive effect was
provided by an Fe/Cr or Co/Ru artificial superlattice
structure in which an antiferromagnetic coupling exists
between adjacent Fe or Co layers across a nonmagnetic
metallic thin layer made of Cr or Ru, respectively. Also, it was discovered and disclosed in "Journal
of The Physical Society of Japan (Vol. 59, p3061, 1990)"
that a giant magnetoresistive effect was provided as well
by an artificial superlattice structure of Ni-Fe/Cu/Co in
which a magnetic metallic thin layer made of Ni-Fe and a
magnetic metallic thin layer made of Co are separated by a
nonmagnetic metallic thin layer made of Cu and are not
magnetically coupled with each other. The superlattice
structure exhibited an MR ratio of approximately 10% by the
application of a magnetic field of 3 kOe at room temperature.In addition, it was also discovered and disclosed
in a "Report (MR91-9) of Technical Research" published by
Electronic Information Communication Society that a giant
magnetoresistive effect was provided by an artificial
superlattice structure of Ni-Fe-Co/Cu/Co or Ni-Fe-Co/Cu in
which an
