<ABSTRACT>
In order to avoid leaks of the fluid for lubricating the bearings (12a, 12b) of a turbomachine such as an aircraft turbojet engine, when the speed of this turbomachine drops below the idling speed, it is proposed to connect the chambers (20a, 20b) surrounding the bearings (12a, 12b) to free air via a pipe (48a, 48b) in which a jet pipe (49a, 49b) has been placed. The nozzle of this jet pipe is connected to a source of compressed air, such as the compressor (56b, 56a) of another turbomachine, via a valve (54a, 54b) which is made to open under the abovementioned conditions.

<CLAIMS>
A depressurising device for the lubricating chambers 
(20a) surrounding each of the bearings (12a) of a turbomachine 

(10a), the device comprising ducts (48a) communicating with 
atmosphere and connecting the chambers (20a) to the exterior, 

the chambers (20a) being supplied with pressurised liquid 
lubricant by a feed circuit (24a), characterised in that the 

depressurising device also comprises auxiliary pumping means 
(49a) supplied by an external pressure source (56b) 

in the form of the compressor of a second turbomachine (10b). 
A depressurising device according to claim 1, 
characterised in that the auxiliary pumping means (49a) are 

disposed in the duct (48a) communicating with atmosphere. 
A depressurising device according to claim 1 
comprising a duct (48a) communicating with atmosphere and 

opening into an air/lubricant separator (40a), the same having 
an air exhaust circuit (46a), characterised in that the 

auxiliary pumping means (49a) are placed in the exhaust duct 
(46a). 
A depressurising device according to any of claims 1 
to 3, characterised in that the auxiliary pumping means (49a) 

are in the form of a static pump. 
A depressurising device according to any of claims 1 
to 4, characterised in that it also comprises control means 

for the auxiliary pumping means (49a). 
A depressurising device according to claim 5, 
characterised in that the control means take the form of a 

valve (54a) in the compressed air feed duct (52a).  

 
A depressurising device according to claim 6, 
characterised in that the valve (54a) is normally closed and 

is open when the speed of the turbomachine (10a) is 
insufficient. 
A depressurising device according to any of claims 1 
to 7, characterised in that the depressurising device of the 

second turbomachine (10b) comprises auxiliary pumping means 
(49b), the same being supplied by an external pressure source 

(56a) consisting of the compressor of the first turbomachine 
(10a).
