Device for packaging filled tea bags in groups having 
a row of bags (12) fixed in a stacking shaft (10) by 

means of a row holder (29) and a row slider (30), a 
following rotor (33) with at least two cartridges 

(39, 36) for receiving the fixed row of bags and a 
transport device consisting of a further row holder 

(37) and row slider (38) for transporting the row of 
bags out of a rotated cartridge over a box (41
) which 
is brought into position,
 
characterised in that
 
in the entrance region of the stacking shaft (10), 

together with a bag holder (17) displaceable during 
row formation in the longitudinal direction, two 

opposite, fixed restraining fingers (16) are 
additionally provided, between which the tea bags 

(11) fed individually through a bag advancer (14) are 
positioned before the row holder (29) takes over the 

holding of the row of bags from the bag holder (17), 
and that a pusher is provided for pushing the row of 

bags into the box. 
Device according to Claim 1, characterised in that 
the bag holder (17) is friction damped and has two 

fingers (21) engaging at opposite positions laterally 
into the stacking shaft (10). 
Device according to Claim 2, characterised in that 
each finger (21) of the bag holder (17) is firmly 

connected to a sliding element (25) which, acted on 
by pressure, rests against a brake strip (26). 
Device according to Claim 3, characterised in that 
the brake strip (26) is of concave construction and  

 
in the forward region has at least one groove (28) 

running transversely. 
Device according to one of Claims 1 to 4, 
characterised in that the bag holder (17) is 

displaceable between a starting position and a 
specifiable end position, on reaching which it 

releases the row of bags (12) and returns to the 
starting position. 
Device according to one of Claims 1 to 5, 
characterised in that the row holder (29) provided 

in the stacking shaft (10) and the further row 
holder (37) of the transport device are friction 

damped. 
Device according to one of Claims 1 to 6, 
characterised in that in the interior of the 

stacking shaft (10) guide bars (24) running at the 
side are provided. 
Device according to one of Claims 1 to 7, 
characterised in that the two cartridges (35, 36) 

are arranged at an angular spacing offset with 
respect to the axis of rotation (34). 
Device according to Claim 8, characterised in that 
in the cartridges (35, 36) lateral holders (39, 40) 

are provided in pairs of which the front holder pair 
(39) is fixed in position and the rear holder pair 

(40) is adjustable in the longitudinal direction. 
Device according to one of Claims 1 to 9, 
characterised in that the bag advancer (14) is 

preceded by a tong-shaped grab device (13) which  
 

removes the tea bag (11) with head downwards from a 
tea packaging machine of known construction. 
Device according to Claim 10, characterised in that 
in the path of movement of the grab device (13) a 

bearing rail (15) is provided in front of the 
stacking shaft (10) at the level of its lower 

bearing surface.
