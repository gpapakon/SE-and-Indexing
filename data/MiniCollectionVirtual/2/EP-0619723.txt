<ABSTRACT>
A device for targeted delivery of a mixed amalgam consists of a hollow body (11) in which a pressure piston (12) is movable, from outside, from an initial position to an end position against the force of a pressure spring, a closable amalgam outlet section (13) coupled to the hollow body at the side of the latter opposite to the pressure piston (12), a mixed amalgam reception section (15) coupled to the hollow body (11) for dispensing determined amalgam amounts through a closable inlet (16) in the displacement area of the pressure piston (12), and a closure member (19) for the hollow body (11) arranged in the displacement area of the pressure piston (12) between its end position and the amalgam inlet (16). A portioning chamber (18) whose rear wall is formed by the pressure piston (12) and whose front wall is formed by the closure member (19) in its closed position is formed in the amalgam inlet (16) area, in the hollow body (11).
