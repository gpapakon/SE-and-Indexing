<ABSTRACT>
A silver halide color photographic light-sensitive mate­
rial is disclosed. The material is comprised of a support base 

having thereon a silver halide emulsion layer and a cyan dye 
forming coupler. The coupler is a compound represented by 

the general formula (I) : 

 
wherein the substituents in the general formula (I) are as 

defined in the specification. The coupler has good solubility 
in an organic solvent having a high boiling point and a high 

dye forming rate even in a color developing solution which 
does not contain benzyl alcohol. Further, the coupler pro­

vides a cyan color image having a high maximum density 
and excellent fastness to light. Decreasing in optical density 

of the cyan color image is not substantially observed even 
when the color photographic light-sensitive material is 

processed with a bleaching solution which has a weak 
oxidation power or a bleaching solution which is exhausted.
