<ABSTRACT>
After trench formation on a semiconductor wafer (14) using a hard 
trench mask containing a phosphosilicate glass top layer and an underlying 

thermal oxide layer, the phosphosilicate glass layer may be removed without 
substantially etching the thermal oxide layer. The wafer temperature is 

increased to at least 40°C (36) prior to etching with an HF/H₂O vapor (40-44).

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates in general to the field of semiconductor wafer 
processing. More particularly, the present invention relates to a method for 
selective removal of hard trench masks. In certain trench formation processes in semiconductor fabrication, a 
phosphosilicate glass/nitride/thermal oxide stack is used as a hard mask for 
trench etching. After trench formation, only the topmost layer of the trench 
mask, or the phosphosilicate glass (PSG), should be subsequently stripped by 
diluted hydrofluoric acid (HF) without damaging the underlying nitride and 
thermal oxide layers. However, the wet phosphosilicate glass strip also 
etches and causes undercutting of the thermal oxide. The resulting undercut 
structure of the thermal oxide may cause or aggravate certain leakage 
mechanisms in the fabricated semiconductor device. Such leakage 
phenomena are undesirable and need to be eliminated or greatly reduced. 
Additional applications include the selective removal of phosphosilicate glass 
or borophosphosilicate glass (BPSG) from a patterned stack which also 
contain thermal oxide and/or other similar oxide compositions, such as 
plasma and nonplasma chemical vapor deposited oxides (CVD), doped and 
undoped oxides, native oxides, and chemical oxides. In accordance with the present invention, a method for hard trench 
mask removal is provided. The method for removing hard trench masks 
eliminates or substantially reduces the amount of thermal oxide 
undercutting during removal of the phosphosilicate glass after trench 
formation. Additionally, wafer fabrication is greatly facilitated since the 
hard trench removal process is far less dependent on the duration of the etch.  In one aspect of the present invention, there is provided a method for 
removing a hard trench mask after trench formation on a wafer, comprising 
the steps of raising the temperature of the wafer to a predetermined setting;
 
   generating an etchant vapor; and exposing the wafer to said generated 
etchant vapor. In another aspect of the present invention, after trench formation on a 
semiconductor wafer using a hard trench mask containing a phosphosilicate 
glass top layer and an underlying thermal oxide layer, the phosphosilicate 
glass layer may be removed without substantially etching the thermal oxide 
layer. The wafer temperature is increased to at least 40°C prior to etching 
with an HF/H₂O vapor. For a better understanding of the present invention, reference may be 
made to the accompanying drawings, in which:
