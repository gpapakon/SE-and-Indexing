<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to rubber compositions 
reinforced with steel cable and tires having at least 
one component thereof. The tire component is 
comprised of rubber, particularly sulfur cured rubber, 
containing carbon black, and optionally silica, in 
combination with dithiodipropionic acid and a 
methylene donor. In one aspect, the component is a rubber skim 
stock encompassing tire cord reinforcement for the 
tire. The invention relates to adhering rubber to tire 
cord reinforcement in a component of a vehicular tire. Pneumatic rubber tires are conventionally 
prepared with rubber components which can be a blend 
of various rubbers which is typically reinforced with 
a reinforcing pigment such as carbon black. In one aspect, it is desired to provide rubber 
compositions which maintain good adhesion to 
reinforcing tire cord, which is typically in a form of 
fiber, or fabric, reinforcement, particularly wire 
reinforcement. A rather conventional method in 
promoting adhesion between rubber and such fiber 
reinforcement is to pretreat the reinforcing fiber 
with a mixture of rubber latex and a 
phenol/formaldehyde condensation product, or resin, in 
which the phenol is usually resorcinol. This is often 
referred to as the "RFL" (resorcinol-formaldehyde-latex) 
method. An alternative method of promoting 
such adhesion is to form the resin in-situ (in the 
vulcanized rubber/fiber matrix) by blending the  
 
phenol/formaldehyde condensation product (referred to 
herein as the "in-situ" method). The components of the condensation product 
consist of a methylene acceptor and a methylene donor. 
The most common methylene donors include N-(substituted 
oxymethyl) melamine, 
hexamethylenetetramine or hexamethoxymethylmelamine. 
A common methylene acceptor is a dihydroxybenzene 
compound such as resorcinol. The in-situ method has 
been found to be particularly effective where the 
reinforcing material is steel wire since pretreatment 
of the wire with the RFL system has been observed to 
be largely ineffective. An example of the use of methylene acceptor and 
methylene donor system may be found in U.S. Patent No. 
3,517,722. Resorcinol is known to form a resin network 
within a rubber polymer by reacting with various 
methylene donors. Unfortunately, the use of 
resorcinol has some inherent disadvantages. 
Resorcinol is not readily dispersed in rubber and in 
fact neither the resin, nor the resorcinol become 
chemically bound to the rubber. Additionally, 
resorcinol in its raw form is excessively volatile
