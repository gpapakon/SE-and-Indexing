<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a ski consisting of a long beam (1) with an arched part (2) of length (LC) between a front contact line (20) and a rear contact line (21); said central part comprising an area where the bindings (5) are attached. The ski comprises two load transmitters (6, 7) positioned centrally (2), one in front of and one behind said attachment area (5). One of the ends (60, 70) of each load transmitter is connected to the beam by a full joint (8); the other end (61, 71) is connected by a partial connection means which is free to move in a lengthwise direction and is formed by an elastic and/or viscous component (90, 91) that tends to resist the lengthwise movement of said load transmitter. When flexing forces occur, the ratio of the movement ( DELTA 1) of the partially connected end (61) of the front load transmitter (6) to the movement ( DELTA 2) of the partially connected end (71) of the rear load transmitter (7) is between 1.2:1 and 2.5:1; and the ratio of the stiffness (K1) of the elastic and/or viscous component (90) of the front load transmitter (6) to the stiffness (K2) of the elastic and/or viscous component (91) of the rear load transmitter (7) is between 1.2:5 and 5:1. The invention relates to an improvement to known ski damping devices.

Ski constituted by an elongated beam (1) having a arched 
central portion (2) With a length (LC) between a front contact 

line (20) and a rear contact line (21), a front portion (3) 
raised into a spatula and a less raised rear portion (4) into 

a heel, said central portion (2) comprising a binding mounting 
zone (5) corresponding to the standardized zone, said ski 

comprising two transmitters (6, 7) arranged in said central 
portion (2) and each on both sides of said binding mounting 

zone (5), one of the ends (60, 70) of each transmitter being 
connected to the beam by a fixed linkage (8), the other end 

(61, 71) of each transmitter being connected to the beam by a 
partial linking means, free in translation along a 

longitudinal direction, composed of an elastic and/or viscous 
element (90, 91) that opposes the longitudinal displacement of 

said transmitter
 
   characterized in that under the bending stress applied in 

the center of LC, the displacement (Δ1) of the partially 
linked end (61) of the front transmitter (6) with respect to 

the beam (1) is greater than the displacement (Δ2) of the 
partially linked end (71) of the rear transmitter (7), such 

that the ratio (Δ1/Δ2) is comprised between 1.2 and 2.5; and 
the stiffness (K1) of the elastic and/or viscous element (90) 

of the front transmitter (6) is greater than the stiffness 
(K2) of the elastic and/or viscous element (91) of the rear 

transmitter (7), such that the ratio (K1/K2) is comprised 
between 1.2 and 2.5. 
Ski according to claim 1, characterized in that the 
end (60, 70) of each transmitter, which is connected by a 

fixed linkage, is located on the side directed towards the 
front portion (20) or rear portion (21), respectively, the  

 
other end (61, 71) being located on the side directed towards 

the mounting zone (5). 
Ski according to claim 1 or 2, characterized in that 
the ratio of the free length (lT1) of the front transmitter 

(6) to the free length (lT2) of the rear transmitter (7) is 
comprised between 1.5 and 2.5, and the ratio (lT1 + lT2) to LC 

is comprised between 0.15 and 0.25. 
Ski according to any of the preceding claims, 
characterized in that the distance (d1) separating the front 

end (6) from the front contact line (20) is comprised between 
0.18 LC and 0.25 LC. 
Ski according to any of the preceding claims, 
characterized in that the distance (d2) separating the rear 

end (70) of the rear transmitter (7) from the rear contact 
line (21) is comprised between 0.16 LC and 0.21 LC. 
Ski according to any of the preceding claims, 
characterized in that the partial linking means (90, 91) is 

constituted by an interface layer made of elastic or 
viscoelastic material connecting at least the lower surface of 

the end (61, 71) of each transmitter (6, 7) above the beam 
(1), in order to work in shearing via the longitudinal 

displacement of said end (60, 70) with respect to the beam. 
Ski according to any of claims 1-5, characterized in 
that the partial linking means (90, 91) is constituted by a 

spring/abutment (903, 900) assembly connected to the beam and
