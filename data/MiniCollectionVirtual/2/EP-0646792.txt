<ABSTRACT>
This invention describes a series of assays 
useful in evaluating the efficacy of agents which inhibit 

the neurotoxic effects of β-amyloid peptide. These assays 
employ amyloidogenic amylin or β₂-microglobulin as the 

target protein instead of the β-amyloid peptide.

<DESCRIPTION>
Alzheimer's disease is a degenerative disorder 
of the human brain. Clinically, it appears as a 
progressive dementia. Its histopathology is characterized 
by degeneration of neurons, gliosis, and the abnormal 
deposition of proteins in the brain. Proteinaceous 
deposits (called "amyloid") appear as neurofibrillary 
tangles, amyloid plaque cores, and amyloid of the 
congophilic angiopathy. [For a review, see, D.J. Selkoe, 
Neuron, 6:487-498 (1991)] While there is no general agreement as to the 
chemical nature of neurofibrillary tangles, the major 
constituent of both the amyloid plaque cores and the 
amyloid of the congophilic angiopathy has been shown to be 
a 4500 Dalton protein originally termed β-protein or 
amyloid A4. Throughout this document this protein is 
referred to as β-amyloid peptide or protein. β-amyloid peptide is proteolytically derived 
from a transmembrane protein, the amyloid precursor 
protein. Different splice forms of the amyloid precursor 
protein are encoded by a widely expressed gene. see. e.g., 
K. Beyreuther and B. Muller-Hill, Annual Reviews in 
Biochemistry, 58:287-307 (1989). β-amyloid peptide 
consists, in its longest forms, of 42 or 43 amino acid 
residues. J. Kang, et al., Nature (London), 325:733-736  
 
(1987). These peptides, however, vary as to their amino-termini. 
C. Hilbich, et al., Journal of Molecular Biology, 
218:149-163 (1991). Because senile plaques are invariably surrounded 
by dystrophic neurites, it was proposed early that β-amyloid 
peptide is involved in the loss of neuronal cells 
that occurs in Alzheimer's disease. B. Yankner and co-workers 
were the first to demonstrate that synthetic β-amyloid 
peptide could be neurotoxic in vitro and in vivo. 
B.A. Yankner, et al., Science, 245:417 (1989); See, also, 
N.W. Kowall, et al., Proceedings of the National Academy of 
Sciences. U.S.A., 88:7247 (1991). Other research groups, 
however, were unable to consistently demonstrate direct 
toxicity with β-amyloid peptide. See, e.g., Neurobiology of 
Aging, 13:535 (K. Kosik and P. Coleman, eds. 1992). Even 
groups receiving β-amyloid peptide from a common source 
demonstrate conflicting results. P. May, et al., 
Neurobiology of Aging, 13:605-607 (1991). In addition to Alzheimer's disease, Down's 
syndrome is also characterized by an accumulation of β-amyloid 
peptide. In patients suffering from Down's 
syndrome the β-amyloid peptide is the primary constituent 
of senile plaques and cerebrovascular deposits. Because of the debilitating effects of
