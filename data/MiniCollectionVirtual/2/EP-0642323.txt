<ABSTRACT>
A fixing pin (1) for securing small bone fragments (B) on larger bone fragments (A) during osteosynthesis operations has a smooth-walled shaft (2) connected to a threaded part (3). The transition zone (4) between the shaft and the threaded part is conically designed. In addition, a support washer (5) may be coupled to the fixing pin. The conical step of the fixing pin is engaged in a mating recess (6) of the support washer and the support washer is slightly concave.

<CLAIMS>
A fixing pin (1) for osteosynthesis work for the securement of small chipped-off bone
fragments (B) to a main bone part (A), having a plain-walled shank part (2) which is

adjoined by a threaded part (3) which has a smaller outside diameter than the shank part
(2), wherein the transition from the threaded part (3) to the shank part (2) is formed by a

step (4) which is fashioned so that it diminishes conically towards the threaded part, the
threaded part (3) is equipped with a fine screw thread, at least the shank part (2) consists

of a material which enables it to be cut to length by cutting pliers, and the extent of the
outside diameter of the threaded part (3) amounts to substantially 70 % - 80 % of the

extent of the outside diameter of the shank part.
A fixing pin according to claim 1, 
characterised in that
 the thread of the threaded part
(3) is formed as a self-tapping thread.
A fixing pin according to either one of the preceding claims, 
characterised by
 a
supporting disc (5) having a hole (6) with a diameter larger than the outside diameter of

the threaded part (3) and smaller than the outside diameter of the shank part (2).
A fixing pin according to claim 3, 
characterised in that
 the shape of the hole (6) is
matched to the conically fashioned step (4).
A fixing pin according to any one of the preceding claims, 
characterised in that
 the
supporting disc is of concave curvature towards the threaded part (3).
A fixing pin according to any one of the preceding claims, 
characterised in that
 the
external boundary edges (7) of the supporting disc (5) are of curved construction. 
A fixing pin according to claim 4, 
characterised in that
 the hole (6) is equipped with an
internal thread which corresponds to the external thread of the threaded part (2).
