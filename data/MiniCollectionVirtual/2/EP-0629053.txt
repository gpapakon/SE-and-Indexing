<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a circuit arrangement for detecting and rejecting adjacent channel interference in a broadcast receiver, particularly an FM receiver, by means of which the bandwidth is reduced in the IF signal path when adjacent-channel signal interference occurs. To detect the interfering variables, IF levels are detected at the input and output of an IF filter with low bandwidth and are compared with one another. By means of signals derived therefrom, filters of different bandwidths adapted to the interfering variables are connected into the IF signal path.

Circuit arrangement for adjacent channel identification
and suppression in a broadcast radio receiver,

in particular an FM receiver, by means of which the
bandwidth in the IF signal path is reduced when interfering

adjacent channel signals occur, characterized in
that the output of a first IF filter (5) provided in the

IF signal path is connected to the input of a variable
bandwidth IF filter arrangement (6, 14
1
 to 14
N
) and the
input of a first level evaluation circuit (11) as well as

to the input of a second IF filter (15) whose bandwidth
is less than the first IF filter (5), in that the output

of the second IF filter (15) is connected to the input of
a second level evaluation circuit (12), in that the

outputs of the level evaluation circuits (11, 12) are
connected to a comparison circuit (13) which controls the

bandwidth of the IF filter arrangement (6, 14
1
 to 14
N
),
and in that the comparison circuit (13) switches to one

filter in the IF filter arrangement (14
1
 to 14
N
) as a
function of the level difference between the outputs of

the level evaluation circuits (11, 12), such that the
bandwidth of the IF signal path suppresses the influence

of interference from the adjacent transmitters.
Circuit arrangement for adjacent channel identification
according to Claim 1, characterized in that the

inputs of the level evaluation circuits (11, 12) each
have a rectifier stage and a low-pass filter connected

downstream from it.
Circuit arrangement for adjacent channel identification
according to one of Claims 1 or 2, characterized 

in that the comparison circuit (13) is designed in such
a manner that, at a previously defined threshold value by

which the level that is present at the first level
evaluation circuit (11) is greater than the level that is

present at the second level evaluation circuit (12), this
comparison circuit (13) sets the bandwidth of the IF

signal path to a value previously defined with respect to
this threshold value.
Circuit arrangement for adjacent channel identification
according to one of Claims 1 to 3, characterized

in that the variable bandwidth IF filter arrangement (6,
14
1
 to 14
N
) has at least two filters (14
1
, 14
N
) which have
different bandwidths and can be connected into the IF

signal path by means of switches (6) controlled by the
comparison circuit.
Circuit arrangement for adjacent channel identification
according to one of Claims 1 to 4, characterized

in that the comparison circuit (13) is designed as a
logic circuit.
Circuit arrangement for adjacent channel identification
according to one of Claims 4 or 5, characterized

in that, in one of the switch positions of the stepping
switch (6), the second IF filter (15) is inserted into

the IF signal path of the variable bandwidth IF filter
arrangement (6, 14
1
 to 14
N
).
