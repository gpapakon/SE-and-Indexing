<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an image forming
apparatus which will
develop an electrostatic latent image on a latent image
carrier with a powdery developer and may be used in both a
horizontal position or an upright position.In image recording apparatuses, such as a copying
machine, a printer and a facsimile, a latent image forming
apparatus like an electrophotographic apparatus is used due
to the widespread use of image recording on normal
sheets of paper.Such an image forming apparatus forms an electrostatic
latent image on a photosensitive drum or the like. Then,
the electrostatic latent image on the photosensitive drum is
developed with a powder developer to provide a visible
image. The developed image on the photosensitive drum is
then transferred on a sheet, and the sheet is then separated
from the photosensitive drum. Thereafter, the developed
image on the sheet is fixed.In view of the current office environment, it is
desirable that the image forming apparatus be sited in any
position. That is, the image forming apparatus should be
designed to allow a user to freely select the way the
apparatus is sited, upright siting for narrow site space
or horizontal siting for low short site space. Figs. 10A and 10B are explanatory diagrams of prior
arts.Such an image forming apparatus as an electro-photographic
printer will be described below. As shown in Fig.10A, a
precharger 91 uniformly charges the surface of a
photosensitive drum 90, and an exposing unit 92 exposes the
photosensitive drum 90 to a light image to form an
electrostatic latent image thereon. A developing unit 93
is provided to develop the electrostatic latent image on
the photosensitive drum 90. This developing unit 93
supplies a powder developer (e.g., one-component magnetic
toners or a two-component developer) to the photosensitive
drum 90 to develop the electrostatic latent image.The developed image on the photosensitive drum 90 is
transferred onto a sheet that has been fed out from a sheet
cassette 98. The sheet carrying the transferred image is
fed to a fixing unit 96 where the developed image is fixed
on the sheet. The photosensitive drum after image transfer
is cleaned with a cleaner 95.The powdery developer in the developing unit 93 has
fluidity in the direction of gravity, so that gravity is a
dominant factor in supplying the powdery developer. The
image forming apparatus shown in Fig. 10A, which functions
in a horizontal position, will carry out a stable developing
operation in the horizontal position.This type of image

<CLAIMS>
An image forming apparatus capable of
performing an image forming operation in both a

horizontal position and an upright position without
variation in image density between the two positions,

comprising:

a rotary endless latent image carrier (20);
image forming means (21, 22) for forming an electrostatic
latent image on said latent image carrier (20);
developing means (23, 24) for developing said electrostatic
latent image on said latent image carrier (20) with a
