<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a sealing or covering profile which is made of polymer materials and has a fastening part which can be mounted on a flange or in a groove and can be fixed on the flange and/or in the groove by means of transversal clamping forces. It is particularly easy to mount owing to the fact that it is wholly or partly composed of a thermoplastic polymer material which is known per se and has a so-called shape memory, and that after it has been given its original shape, which is approximately the shape in which it is to be used to form its respective function, it is heated and deformed, in a wholly or partly reversible manner and frozen by cooling in such a way that it can be installed with a small amount of force. After installation, the profile according to the invention is reheated, which causes it to reshape itself as a result of and following the shape memory which results in the establishment of a secure positive and/or non-positive clamp-fastening.
