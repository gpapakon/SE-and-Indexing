<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a device for sorting, storing and paying out bank notes. With the equipment which is currently available, the problem is of handling paying-in and paying-out in a single apparatus, without separating paid-in from paid-out notes. In addition, there is a problem in handling notes which have been in circulation and are in poor physical condition. The invention solves these problems by enclosing the notes between two films (14, 15) and storing the notes in consecutive order after each other around a spool (3). The film (14 or 15) is initially wound up on two spools (1 or 2) and is gradually fed to a spool (3) as notes are fed in. The spools (1, 2, 3) are driven by electric motors, which are controlled by a control device (13) receiving a start signal from a feed-in detector (6), or by the electronic circuitry unit (12), which can also be controlled from peripheral equipment such as, for example, an outer keyboard or till apparatus. The invention is for use primarily at manually operated cash register counters in which an installation of the described device is normally required for each note type/value which it is wished should be included in the system.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a device according 
to the preamble of Patent Claim 1. It is well known that devices for the 
handling of bank notes are used in respect of payment 
into unattended machines and as paying-out machines 
(cash dispensers etc.). These systems are found in a 
plurality of known embodiments. The problem with these devices is that they 
have difficulty in handling notes in an inferior 
condition and that they require two separate systems 
for paying-in and paying-out, this being due to the 
fact that storage takes place in an unsorted order in 
the case of the feed-in device, whereas the paying-out 
unit requires the notes to be present in ordered 
bundles to enable the correct number of notes to be 
paid out. Document readers/note readers are principally 
designed to function in respect of unmanned 
applications in which great accuracy is required in 
order to check the genuineness of the note. A major 
deficiency is that current systems for paying-out do 
not readily handle notes of uneven quality, which 
situation naturally occurs when notes are received from 
customers. Nor is there any known technique for 
catering within a single unit for both the receipt and 
paying-out of notes, which would mean that the paying-in 
till and the paying-out till would have to be 
separated if the abovenamed units were to be used. In EP-A-0 409 809 an arrangement for feeding valuable documents is disclosed, said 
arrangement comprising a storage means including two mutually coacting belts. Said 
arrangement further comprises a detector 17 to identify the type of bank note, 
eventuality of double-feed, etc. This arrangement is not designed for feed-out and 
feed-in of bank notes and the belts and the storage means are not so arranged that 
feed-out can be obtained. SE-B-210 179 discloses a device for feed-in and feed-out and storage of coins and 
bank notes. The device comprises singular units for in-feed and out-feed and storage 
of coins and bank notes, each unit comprising a belt which is wound up onto reels, a 
storage reel and an empty reel. The coins or bank notes activate means connected to a 
count and control unit at the feed-in or the feed-out. The belts are of transparent 
material and the detector is arranged to register the coins or bank notes when they pass 
the feed-in and the feed-out opening. However, the device is not designed for manual 
feed-in of bank notes, and no detector is arranged to check the genuiness of a coin or 
a bank note. As another example of the abovementioned,

</DESCRIPTION>
<CLAIMS>
Device in a cash-register system for handling documents of value, for example 
bank notes, by means of a piece of equipment per note type, each piece of equipment comprising two single film 

collecting spools (1, 2) together with the associated films (14, 15), a double film collecting 
spool (3), said documents being fed in, stored in consecutive order between said films (14, 

15) and wound around said double film collecting spool (3), a first detection device (6) for detecting the 
presence of a document, and a second detection device (10, 11) having the task of carrying 

out a qualitative check on each document, such as size, value and genuineness of a bank 
note, characterized in that in each piece of equipment said first detection device (6) is placed in the proximity of the 

feed-in or feed-out opening of the piece of equipment for detecting the presence of a document in said 

opening, in that in each piece of equipment said second detection device (10, 11) is placed further in in the piece of equipment than 
said first detection device (6), in that said documents are of the same type and/or value in 

said double film collecting spool (3) of each piece of equipment and are able to be fed 
out in reverse order, whereas the last fed-in document of the same type and/or value in one 

of said pieces of equipment is fed out first, the feed-out being realized by 
reversing the direction of movement of said spools (1, 2, 3), so that the desired number of 

documents of value can be obtained, and in that said cash-register system or a numeric 
keyboard generates a control signal to control the feed-out of and number of documents of 

value with regard to earlier in the same processing sequence executed and registered feed-in 
of documents of value, so that the device, with the aid of said system, automatically feeds 

out a correct number and the right sort of documents of value in the event of an equivalent 
in change being given, said documents of value being each detected via said second detection device (10, 

11) as they are fed out, so that an electronic circuitry (12) with memory circuits obtains a 
computing-down figure for each pay-out which is deducted 

from a stored value in said memory circuits.  
 
Device according to claim 1, 
characterized
 in that said second detection device 
(10, 11) operates with light, visible or invisible to the eye, according to the transillumination 

principle, and in that said films (14, 15) can be transilluminated by the light type which has 
been used. 
Device according to claim 1 or 2, 
characterized
 in that said second detection 
device (10, 11) is placed where the documents are pressed between said films. 
Device according to any of the preceding claims, 
characterized
 in that said 
electronic circuitry (12), by comparing the feed-in speed of said document of value and the 

time for which the second detection device (10, 11) is activated by said document of value, 
is able to determine the size of said document of value and whether the correct type of 

document of value has been fed in, whereby if said document of value is not accepted the rotation of said 
spools (1, 2, 3) is reversed so that the document of value is fed back out again and the electronic 

circuitry does not store this value as a feed in. 
Device according to any of the preceding claims, 
characterized
 in that it 
further comprises reversible electric motors (301, 302, 303), which drive said spools (1, 2, 

3) and which are controlled from the electronic unit (12) and a control element (13). 
Device according to any of the preceding claims, 
characterized
 in that said 
films (14, 15) are made by transparent material. 
Device according to any of the preceding claims, 
characterized
 in that a 
plurality of said pieces of equipment are found disposed within a casing unit.
