<ABSTRACT>
A method and resultant product are disclosed 
wherein a metal film is deposited by sputtering a metal 

cathode target in an essentially nonreactive atmosphere 
comprising inert gas and a reactive gas, wherein the 

concentration of reactive gas is sufficiently low that the 
sputtering is accomplished in the metallic mode, i.e. the film 

is deposited as metal. The metal film of the present 
invention is harder than a metal film sputtered in an 

atmosphere consisting of only inert gas. The method and 
resultant product may further comprise thermal oxidation of 

the metal film, which proceeds more efficiently than oxidation 
of a metal film sputtered in an atmosphere consisting of only 

inert gas.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates generally to the art
of sputtered films and more particularly to the art of durable
metal oxide films produced by magnetron sputtering.Sputtered metal oxide films are well known in the
art. Tin oxide, zinc oxide, titanium oxide and many other
metal oxides are known to be deposited by sputtering the
respective metals in an oxidizing atmosphere such as air or a
mixture of oxygen and inert gas such as argon. It is also
known that a metal film can be deposited by sputtering a metal
in an inert atmosphere such as argon, and the metal film
subsequently oxidized thermally by heating in an oxidizing
atmosphere such as air.Various metals can be deposited either as metallic
films or metal oxide films depending on whether the metal
cathode target is sputtered in an inert atmosphere or an
oxidizing atmosphere. Generally, sputtering in an inert
atmosphere, i.e. in the metallic mode, is faster and more
efficient. The resulting coating is a metal film having
metallic properties, i.e. generally low transmittance, high
reflectance and electrically conductive. Such films are
generally not very hard or durable, and are easily damaged in
handling. Dielectric metal oxide films are typically high
transmittance, lower reflectance and electrically insulating.
However, because they are insulating, they do not deposit as
efficiently by sputtering. To produce very thick metal oxide
films by sputtering is inefficient, costly and may not result
in a durable film. To produce very thick metal oxide films by
thermally oxidizing metal films efficiently sputtered in an
inert atmosphere is inherently rate-limited because oxygen may
not readily penetrate beyond the initially formed surface
layer of metal oxide. 
M. Yoshitake et al. reported in "Thin Solid Films" 230(1993)July 15, No. 1, p.48-54, on the
use of ion beam current as a process control in the reactive sputtering of zirconium oxide. It
is disclosed that the oxygen partial pressure changes greatly from the initial oxygen pressure
when sputtering zirconium in an oxygen atmosphere. Because Zr is a very active element, as
is Ti, these sputtered Zr atoms capture O2 molecules by gettering action. The transmission
characteristics of several Zr-O films deposited on a fused quartz substrate at a constant O2
pressure are reported. The film deposited at an IB of 110 mA is metallic and no transmitted
light was observed. No transparent film were obtained in the IB region between 40 and 110
mA, when sputtering at pressures below 2.7 x 10-3 Pa. For the preparation

A method of depositing a hard metal film onto a substrate by
cathode sputtering comprising the steps of:


a. placing the substrate in an evacuated chamber having a metal
cathode target and comprising an atmosphere comprising argon

as inert gas and an amount of from 2 to 30 percent oxygen as

the atmosphere below the switching point from the metallic
