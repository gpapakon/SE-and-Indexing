<ABSTRACT>
A handheld data entry terminal includes a housing and a 
scanning head mounted to the housing for pivotal movement between 

at least first and second reading positions. The scanning head, 
when actuated, optically scans an encoded symbol and detects light 

reflected from the encoded symbol while in either of the first and 
second reading positions. As desired, a terminal user can 

establish either one of first and second trigger switches mounted 
to the housing as a scanning head actuating switch, leaving the 

other of the trigger switches to be established as a shift key for 
determining the type of characters entered by alphanumeric data 

entry keys of a keypad also mounted to the housing in conjunction 
with an LCD display.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to electro-optical systems for
reading indicia of different light reflectivity, such as bar code
symbols. In particular, the present invention to a handheld data
entry terminal of improved ergonomic design.Related to the handheld data entry terminal of the present
invention are the laser scanner systems and components disclosed
in U.S. Patent Nos. 4,387,297; 4,460,120; 4,816,661; 4,806,742;
4,845,350; and 4,825,057 as well as U.S. Patent Applications Ser. Nos.
07/147,708 and 08/061,070. All of these patents and
patent applications are owned by the assignee of the present
invention.As exemplified in the cited related art, a light source, such
as a laser, generates a light beam which is directed by optical
components along a light path toward a bar code symbol. The laser 
light beam is repetitively scanned by a scanning component, such
as an oscillating mirror situated in the beam path, to sweep a
beam spot beam across the bar code symbol. A photodetector
detects light of variable intensity reflected or scattered from
the symbol and generates electrical signals indicative of the
detected light. These electrical signals are decoded and into
data representative of the data encoded in the symbol.Barcode scanner terminals are basically of two types, the
fixed installation type exemplified by the scanners incorporated
in supermarket checkout counters and the portable type. The
portable type is particularly advantageous in situations where
articles bearing the barcode symbols cannot, from a practical
standpoint, be brought to a fixed scanner terminal to enter the
barcode data. Thus, for example, handheld barcode scanners are
particularly advantageous to inventory stock distributed
throughout a store, warehouse, etc.Known handheld barcode scanners have taken a variety of
shapes. A pistol shape has been a popular configuration due to
the inherent ease in aiming the laser beam at a target barcode
symbol. Unfortunately, a pistol-shaped scanner is not
particularly conducive to the inclusion of other desirable
features, such as a data entry keypad and an output device, such
as a liquid crystal display (LCD). Also, it is very difficult to
design an ergonomic, portable barcode scanner and keypad data
entry terminal that is convenient to use by both left and right-handed
operators. EP-A-0 490 601 discloses a portable coded symbol scanner
including a support member and a housing member rotatably
mounted on the support member and having a pair of
sloping supporting surfaces oriented at an
