<ABSTRACT>
Coating equipment 20 with an extrusion type coating 
head comprising a back edge 6 having a top side which slopes 

away from a support from the height of the top of a front edge 
5, a coating fluid spouting slot 4 defined by both the edges, 

and guide plates for regulating the width of a coating fluid 
spouted from the slot tip on both side ends of the slot for 

applying the coating fluid to the support surface from the slot 
4 in a non-pressurized condition. The nearest point to the 

support surface in the slot corresponding portion of the upper 
edge of the guide plate 7 is positioned slightly upstream from 

the center line of the width of the slot along the support 
running direction and the area given by the product of the 

distance between the nearest point and the support surface and 
the width of the slot is made a specific value or less.T h e 

coating equipment thus formed has no risk of damaging the 
support and effectively lessens the eff
ect of air entering from 
both end sides of an application point of a coating fluid 

during a high speed thin coat application and produces no film 
cut when the coating fluid is applied to the running support 

surface by non-pressurization type coating equipment.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to coating equipment using an
extrusion type coating head for uniformly applying a coating
fluid to the surface of a continuously running belt-like
support, and more particularly to extrusion type coating
equipment for uniformly applying a coating fluid to a support
surface in a non-pressurized condition when the coating fluid
is coated to the support surface from a slot. In particular, the invention relates to coating equipment with an extrusion type coating
head disposed between run guide means spaced a predetermined distance apart and
facing a continuously running support retained by said run guide means, said coating
head comprising a front edge, a back edge positioned downstream with respect to a
running direction of the support from said front edge and having an end opposite the
support which slopes away from the support in the downstream direction, a coating fluid
spouting slot defined by both of said edges.Further, the invention relates to a process of applying a coating fluid with such a coating
equipment.Such coating equipment and method are known from EP-A-0566124. Hitherto, a step of applying a desired coating fluid to
the surface of a flexible support has been executed in a
manufacturing process of photo-sensitive material, magnetic
recording media, etc. Coating fluids containing various fluid
compositions are available according to their applications.
For example, coating fluids of photo-sensitive emulsion coats,
undercoats, protective coats, back coats, etc., are available
for photo-sensitive material and magnetic coats, undercoats,
protective coats, lubricant coats, etc., are available for
magnetic recording media. The coating fluids are aqueous
solutions, organic solvent solutions, etc., containing
essential components, binders, and various admixtures as
required.Hitherto, various application methods, such as a roll
coat method, a gravure coat method, a roll coat plus doctor
method, extrusion type application method, and slide coat
method, have been used as methods of applying such coating
fluids to the flexible support surface. In recent years, an 
application method using an extrusion type coating head has
been often used for applying a magnetic coating fluid.A typical method using an extrusion type coating head
is, as well known, a method of applying a thin and uniform
coating of fluid extruded from the slot end to the surface of
a continuously running flexible support with the coating head
disposed between a pair of run guide means spaced at a given
distance
