<ABSTRACT>
Exchange surface element for a motor-vehicle radiator, comprising a set of plates (9) made of a polymeric material inside which the heat-transfer fluid (water) circulates, the lateral faces (16) of the plates, between which the refrigerant (air) circulates, being provided with projections (19) in relief. These projections are oriented in the flow direction (L) of the heat-transfer fluid and are placed perpendicular to the flow direction (G) of the refrigerant.

<CLAIMS>
Motor vehicle radiator essentially composed of
parallel plates (9) made of a polymer material, through

which a liquid heat-transfer fluid flows in smooth
channels (21), and between which a gaseous cooling fluid

flows, characterized in that the plates (9) have faces
exposed to the cooling fluid (G) which have linear

protrusions (19) perpendicular to the direction of flow
of the gas.
Radiator according to Claim 1, characterized in
that the linear protrusions are continuous (19).
Radiator according to either one of Claims 1 and
2, characterized in that the linear protrusions of two

adjacent plates have different projections at right
angles to the plates.
Radiator according to any one of Claims 1 to 3,
characterized in that the protrusions have a height (e)

relative to a width (h) separating consecutive plates (9)
which is between 0.01 and 0.5.
Radiator according to any one of Claims 1 to 4,
characterized in that the protrusions have a spacing (p)

in the direction of flow of the cooling fluid, relative
to their height 
(h), of between 5 and 100.
Radiator according to any one of Claims 1 to 5,
characterized in that the plates are extruded.
Radiator according to any one of Claims 1 to 5,
characterized in that the plates are injection-moulded.
Radiator according to any one of Claims 1 to 7,
characterized in that the plates consist of two half-plates

joined together by welding or bonding.
Motor vehicle radiator (10) according to any one 
of Claims 1 to 8, characterized in that it is further

composed of two tanks (11, 12) for heat-transfer fluid,
the tanks each having one face (13) perforated with

recesses into each of which recesses one end of one of
the plates (9) is fitted.
Motor vehicle radiator according to Claim 9,
characterized in that the tanks comprise a casing (14)

connected to the perforated face (13), the perforated
faces (13) and the casings (14) being made of a polymer

material.
