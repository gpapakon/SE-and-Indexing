<ABSTRACT>
New intraocular lenses, fixation member assemblies for use in such lenses and methods for making the same are disclosed. In one embodiment, the present invention involves a method for producing a fixation member assembly which comprises exposing a fixation member component to a first plasma at conditions effective to enhance, relative to a substantially identical fixation member component which is not subjected to the exposing step, the bondability between the fixation member component and a polymeric coating to be located on the fixation member component; and exposing the fixation member to a second plasma in the presence of at least one material selected from polymeric components, polymerizable components and mixtures thereof at conditions effective to form the polymeric coating located on the fixation member component. Enhanced bondability between the polymeric coating-containing fixation member component and the optic of the intraocular lens and/or enhanced biocompatibility are preferably provided.

<DESCRIPTION>
This application is a continuation-in-part of 
application Serial No. 547,859, filed July 3, 1990, 
which is incorporated in its entirety herein by 
reference. See US-A-5 147 397. The present invention relates to intraocular lenses 
and to fixation member assemblies for use in such 
lenses. More particularly, the present invention 
relates to such intraocular lenses and fixation member 
assemblies which provide enhanced bonding strength 
between the components of the lenses and assemblies 
and/or have enhanced biocompatibility. The use of intraocular lenses (IOLs) to improve 
vision and/or to replace damaged or diseased natural 
lenses in human eyes, particularly natural lenses 
impaired by cataracts, has attained wide acceptance. 
Accordingly, a variety of IOLs has been developed for 
surgical implantation in the posterior or anterior 
chambers of the eye according to a patient's needs. Known IOLs comprise an optical lens portion or 
optic which includes an optical zone, and one or more, 
for example two, supporting structures, called fixation 
members, for example loops or haptics, for contacting 
eye tissue to fix or hold the 105 in the proper position 
after implantation. The optic may comprise a soft, 
resilient material, such as any of a variety of flexible 
elastomers, or a relatively hard or rigid material such 
as, for example polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA). The 
fixation members may comprise a filament constructed of 
resilient metal or polymeric substance, such as 
polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA) or polypropylene.  
 Each of the filament fixation members is preferably 
flexible to reduce trauma to sensitive eye structures 
and to be yielding during insertion of the IOL. In 
addition, filament fixation members generally have a 
memory retaining capability, e.g., springiness, so that 
after implantation of an associated IOL, the filament 
fixation members automatically tend to return to their 
normal orientations. As an alternative to filament fixation members, 
some IOLs are provided with footplate-type fixation 
members. These footplates generally extend radially 
outwardly from the optic (for example, in the plane of 
the optic) and terminate in rounded or blunted ends 
configured for placement in an eye chamber. The 
materials for such footplates have included soft 
materials, for example 2-hydroxyethyl methacrylate or 
silicone. Although the filament fixation members are 
preferred over the footplate-type fixation members for 
several reasons, certain difficulties remain. For 
example,
