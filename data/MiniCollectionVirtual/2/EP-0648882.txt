<ABSTRACT>
The material web (1) is loaded by heated circulating air which penetrates from a pressure space (14) via inlet orifices (6, 6') into nozzle boxes (4, 4') by means of a blower (7). In order to achieve a laminar flow and consequently better air distribution, the blower (7) is as far as possible from the inlet orifices (6, 6') and is preferably suspended underneath the ceiling wall (16) of the housing (2). This results in a relatively large and elongate pressure space (14) between the inlet orifices (6, 6') and the delivery side (12) of the blower (7).

Apparatus for the heat treatment of a continuously moved web of 
material (1), in particular a textile web, with a gaseous treatment 

agent, comprising a housing (2) with guide or transport means (3) for 
guiding the web of material therethrough, at least one nozzle casing (4) 

with nozzle openings (5) directed towards the web of material, the nozzle 
casing extending transversely with respect to the direction of transport 

movement over the web of material (1) and at one end having an intake 
opening (6), a fan (7) for producing a circulatory flow (U) in the 

housing and a heating device (8, 9) for heating the treatment agent, 
wherein the housing (2) is subdivided into a pressure chamber (14) 

adjoining the intake opening (6) and the pressure side (12) of the fan 
(7) and a return flow chamber (15) surrounding the nozzle casing (4) and 

adjoining the suction side (13) of the fan (7), characterised in that the 
fan (7) is arranged on the side of the housing (2) opposite to the intake 

opening (6) of the nozzle casing (4). 
Apparatus according to claim 1 characterised in that the housing 
(2) has a top wall (16) and that the fan (7) is arranged under the top 

wall (16) in the housing. 
Apparatus according to claim 2 characterised in that the drive 

device (11) for the fan (7) is arranged above the top wall (16) on the 
housing (2). 
Apparatus according to one of claims 1 to 3 characterised in that 
the heating device is arranged in the pressure chamber (14) between the 

fan (7) and the intake opening (6). 
Apparatus according to claim 4 characterised in that the heating 
device is a radiator unit (8) which can be connected to a heating agent 

source and which extends over the intake opening (6) into the pressure 
chamber (14).  

 
Apparatus according to claim 4 characterised in that the heating 
device is a gas burner (9) arranged in the housing (2) on the top wall 

(16) in the flow direction. 
Apparatus according to one of claims 1 to 6 characterised in that 
at least one respective upper and at least one respective lower nozzle 

casing (4, 4') is arranged on each of the two sides of the web of 
material (1) and that the amount of treatment agent fed to the two nozzle 

casings is controllable by a flap (17) pivotably mounted between the 
upper and the lower intake openings (6, 6'). 
Apparatus according to claim 7 characterised in that the upper 
and the lower intake openings (6, 6') are closable with by-pass flaps 

(18, 18') which are pivotable in the same direction, that a by-pass 
opening (19) is arranged between the pressure chamber (14) and the return 

flow chamber (15) and that the by-pass opening is closable by means of 
the lower by-pass flap (6'). 
Apparatus according to one of claims 1 to 8 characterised in that 
the housing (2) is provided on both longitudinal sides with displaceable 

or pivotable doors (20). 
Apparatus, in particular according to one of claims 1 to 9, with 
at least one exhaust air duct (22) extending parallel to the transport 

direction for the discharge of treatment agent from the housing 
characterised in that a plurality of conduits (24) for the feed of fresh 

air (F) into the housing (2) lead through the exhaust air duct (22), 
wherein the fresh air can be preheated. 
Apparatus according to claim 10 characterised in that the exhaust 
air duct (22) is arranged in the return flow chamber (15) at the bottom 

of the housing (2) and that the conduits (24) extend transversely 
relative to the exhaust air duct (22).  

 
Apparatus according to claim 11 characterised in that respective 
groups of a plurality of conduits (24) are arranged in mutually 

superposed relationship on a plane disposed inclinedly relative to the 
transport direction. 
Apparatus according to one of claims 1 to 9 on which the fan (7) 
is a radial fan with a rotor (29) and a fan housing (30) which enlarges 

substantially in a spiral shape around the rotor axis and on which a 
radial outlet opening (31) is arranged, characterised in that the length 

(L) of the outlet opening (31), said length extending at a right angle to 
the rotor axis (32), is larger than the maximum radius (Rmax) on the fan 

housing (30) and that the outlet opening (31) is arranged at the end of a 
blow-out connecting portion (33) in which guide vanes (34) are arranged 

extending substantially parallel to the rotor axis (32) for uniformly 
distributing the flow over the entire cross-section of the outlet 

opening. 
Apparatus according to claim 13 characterised in that the width 
(BA) of the outlet opening, said width extending parallel to the rotor 

axis (32), is reduced relative to the housing width (BG) in the region of 
the rotor. 
Apparatus according to claim 14 characterised in that the width 
at the inlet of the blow-out connecting portion decreases continuously or 

step-wise from the larger radius (Rmax) to the smaller radius (Rmin) of 
the spiral. 
Apparatus according to one of claims 13 to 15 characterised in 
that the guide vanes (34) become thicker in the flow direction and are
