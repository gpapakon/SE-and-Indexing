<ABSTRACT>
A stowable container holding assembly 
(10) for a vehicle. The assembly (10) includes a 

carrier (12) mounted in a vehicle support 
structure. A tray (18) having a container 

receptacle (22) is supported by and moveable with 
respect to the carrier (12). A motor (34) receives 

energy and converts it to motion. The motion is 
transmitted to the tray (18) and drives the tray 

(18) through an actuation assembly (32) between a 
retracted stowed position and an extended use 

position. The motor (34) is activated by a switch 
(48). Movement of the tray (18) is limited by a 

plurality limit switches (50). When the tray (18) 
is in the extended position, a lamp (62) is 

illuminated, and sensors (58) detect the presence 
of an object in the receptacles (22) and will not 

permit the tray (18) to return to the stowed 
position if an object is present. The tray (18) 

can be moved between the stowed and use positions 
manually in the event of power failure.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to beverage 
container holding assemblies for use in motor 
vehicles, and particularly to powered cup holders 
which are moveable to a compact stowed position. Beverage cup holder assemblies are common 
in today's vehicles. Many differing types of such 
beverage cup holders exist and they can be mounted 
in various positions within the vehicle. These cup 
holders are typically moveable between a stowed or 
concealed position and an extended or use position. The manner in which cup holders are 
stored and moveable are quite varied. United 
States Patent No. 5,171,061 to Marcusen discloses 
a cup holder slidable from a stowed concealed 
position to an extended use position. As the cup 
holder is extended to the use position, cup holder 
arms rotate outwardly to provide a container 
receptacle. Also, a T-shaped bail pivots 
downwardly to support the bottom the beverage 
container. United States Patent No. 4,981,277 to 
Elwell discloses a similar type cup holder. Another type of retractable beverage 
container is shown in United States Patent No.  
 
4,783,037 to Flowerday. Yet another type of cup holder is 
shown in United States Patent No. 4,759,584 to Dykstra et al. All of the aforementioned patents show a cup holder 
assembly of the type that is slidably mountable and can be 
extended from a stowed position to a use position. A 
different type of cup holder is the type disclosed in United 
States Patent Nos. 5,072,989 and 5,007,610. In this type of 
cup holder assembly, the cup holder is pivotally mounted 
within the armrest of a vehicle. United States Patent 4,685,729 issued August 11, 1987 in 
the name of Heesch et al discloses a motorized retractable 
console for an automotive seat 
according to the preamble of claim 1. 
The console can move to an 
extended position to allow access to a compartment therein. 
However, there is no disclosure of a sensor preventing 
retraction of the console to the closed position is containers 
are placed therein. All of the aforementioned types of devices require manual 
movement to extend the cup holder to the use position. Such 
movement may be aided in only one direction in certain 
instances by a spring. That is, a spring can only help extend 
the cup holder to the extended position. No assembly is 
currently known which drives the tray fully in both directions 
between both of the extended use position and retracted stowed 
position. One further deficiency with these types of cup 
holders is that it sometimes becomes difficult for

<CLAIMS>
A stowable container holding assembly (10) for a 
vehicle comprising: 


a carrier (12) for mounting in the vehicle; 
a tray (18) having at least one container receptacle (22) 
supported by and movable with respect to said carrier (
12) 
between a retracted stowed position and an extended use 

position; 
tray movement means (28) operatively associated with said 
tray (18) and said carrier (12) for receiving energy and 

converting said energy to mechanical motion to move said tray 
(18) between said stowed and said use positions; 
switch means (46) for selectively supplying energy to 
said tray movement means (28) to thereby control movement of 

said tray (18) between each of said stowed and said use 
positions; 
said tray movement means (28) comprising a motor (30) for 
receiving said energy in response to actuation of said switch 

means (46) and converting it to said mechanical motion and an 
actuator (32) operatively associated with said motor (30) for 

transmitting said motion to said tray (18); and 
characterized by sensor means (56) for sensing when a 
container is in said receptacle (22) thereby preventing energy 

from being supplied to said motor (30) and thereby prohibiting 
movement of said tray (18) by said motor (30). 
An assembly as set forth in Claim 1 further 
characterized by said actuator (32) comprising a shaft (36) 

connected to said motor (30) and rotatably secured to said 
carrier (12), and receptacle means (40) fixedly disposed on 

said tray (18) for receiving said shaft (36) and for moving in 
response to rotary movement of said shaft (36). 
An assembly as set forth in Claim 2 further 
characterized by said motor (30) comprising a bi-directional 

direct current motor (34) secured to said carrier (12) for  
 

receiving electrical energy and converting same into rotary 
motion. 
An assembly as set forth in Claim 3 further 
characterized by said shaft (36) having a helical thread 

thereon for disposition within said receptacle means (40). 
An assembly as set forth in Claim 4 further 
characterized by said receptacle means (40) comprising a nut 

and ratchet assembly (42,44) for engaging said shaft (36) to 
travel along said helical thread in response to rotary 

movement thereof to thereby move said tray (18) between said 
stowed and said use positions and for allowing said tray (18) 

to be moved manually between said stowed and said use 
positions. 
An assembly as set forth in Claim 5 further 
characterized by said switch means (46) comprising a momentary 

switch (48) for selectively providing said energy to said 
motor (34). 
An assembly as set forth in Claim 1 further 
characterized by said motor (30) including at least one limit 

switch (50) to de-energize said motor (30) when said tray (18) 
has reached one of said stowed or said extended positions. 
An assembly as set forth in Claim 1 further 
characterized by said tray including a lamp (62) for 

illuminating said receptacle (22) when said tray (18) is in 
said extended position.
