<ABSTRACT>
Injection molding apparatus with a number of 
spaced inserts (70) removably seated in a heated melt 

distribution manifold (10). Each insert (70) is seated in a 
transverse opening (72) through the melt distribution manifold (10) 

in alignment with a heated nozzle (20). The insert (70) has a melt 
duct (92) with a smoothly curved bend (94) extending through 90° to 

an outlet (98) in matching alignment with a melt bore (32) extending 
centrally through the nozzle. The insert (70) has an alignment 

pin (100) which extends outwardly through a matching aperture (102) in 
the melt distribution manifold (10) into an opening (104) in the mold 

to both align the insert (70) in the manifold (10) and locate the 
manifold in the mold. The alignment pin bore (108) is positioned 

opposite from and in alignment with the inlet (96) to the melt 
duct (92) so alignment of the melt duct inlet (96) in the insert (70) 

with 
a respective branch (86) of a melt passage (84) in the manifold (10) is 

very accurate.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates generally to injection 
molding apparatus and more particularly to apparatus in 
which removable inserts seated in a melt distribution 
manifold are each accurately aligned by a pin extending 
outwardly in alignment with a melt duct inlet. Multi-cavity injection molding systems having a 
heated melt distribution manifold are well known. The melt 
distribution manifold has a melt passage with a number of 
branches extending outwardly from a common inlet portion to 
convey melt to a number of spaced heated nozzles. The melt 
duct in each nozzle extends at 90° to the respective branch 
of the melt passage in the melt distribution manifold, and 
the flow of melt through each branch and nozzle must be 
balanced and sharp corners or edges which produce shear  
 
stress in the flowing melt are unacceptable. It is also 
known to provide removable inserts or plugs seated in 
transverse openings in the melt distribution manifold in 
alignment with the nozzles. Each insert has a melt duct 
with a smoothly curved bend extending through 90° from an 
inlet in alignment with the respective branch of the melt 
passage in the melt distribution manifold to an outlet in 
alignment with the melt duct through the respective nozzle. 
The melt duct inlet extends through a cylindrical portion 
of the outer surface of the insert and must be very 
accurately aligned with the respective branch of the melt 
passage in the melt distribution manifold to avoid 
unacceptable shear stress in the flowing melt. As seen in Mold-Masters Limited Canadian Patent 
Application Serial Number 2,047,461 Laid-Open January 20, 
1993, entitled "Injection Molding Manifold with Removable 
Inserts", these previous inserts are aligned in the opening 
by a pin extending outwardly from a bore in a flange 
portion of the insert. The problem with these previous 
inserts is that it is extremely difficult to reliably align 
the melt duct inlet with the respective branch of the melt 
passage with sufficient accuracy to avoid producing shear 
stress in the flowing melt. The pin is received in a bore 
in the flange portion of the insert, and the difficulty is 
in drilling the bore in the required position with  
 
sufficient accuracy. Any resulting misalignment of the 
insert cannot be determined during installation, but after 
the system is operating a slight misalignment of any one of 
the inserts in the system produces product of unacceptable 
quality and requires a very costly shut down of the system. 
This problem has resulted in
