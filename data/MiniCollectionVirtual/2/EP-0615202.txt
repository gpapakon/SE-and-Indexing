<ABSTRACT>
A logic description conversion apparatus and a logic description 
conversion method are obtained according to which logic descriptions which 

include a long-term operation logic part which operates at an operation clock 
which is longer than a reference operation clock are converted into more 

advanced logic descriptions from which a logic circuit will be created accurately. 
Conversion-into-table means (1) receives a source code (SC1) which is formed 

by logic descriptions which include a multi-clock transfer path (long-term 
operation logic part), and generates a reference table (D1) which includes 

information about input control logic of an extracted register. Based on an 
indicator (D2) in which register name information of a receiving side of the 

multi-clock transfer path is registered and the reference table (D1), extraction 
and separation means (2) converts the source code (SC1) into a source code 

(SC2) which is formed by logic descriptions in which the long-term operation 
logic part and the input control logic are logically separated from each other. 

Since the long-term operation logic part and the input control logic are logically 
separated from each other, a logic circuit is accurately created by logic 

synthesis.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a logic description conversion apparatus
for and a logic description conversion method of converting a logic description
into a more accurate logic description.In a conventional technique of synthesizing logic, in general, optimum
logic is synthesized from a logic description by register extraction means for
extracting a corresponding register, Boolean means for processing the logic
description by Boolean computation and logic optimization means for optimizing,
based on circuit information and timing information for logic optimization, the
Boolean logic descriptions which were created by the Boolean means.In the following, operation of the present invention will be described in
detail. The register extraction means extracts a part of logic descriptions which
is described in the register format as a register. Then, the Boolean means
processes logic descriptions which are sandwitched between registers or included
in a range which is partitioned by input/output ports, that is, logic descriptions
other than registers. During the process performed by the Boolean means,
whether the logic descriptions are logic of a control computation family or logic
of a data computation family (i.e., data transfer family) is not examined.
Following this, the logic optimization means optimizes the logic in accordance
with the circuit information and the timing information for logic optimization, 
to thereby generate a logic circuit having optimized logic descriptions.In the conventional logic synthesis technique, since the Boolean means
processes logic descriptions without distinguishing logic descriptions of the
control computation family and logic descriptions of the data computation
family, if logic synthesis is to be performed on logic descriptions including a
sequence circuit, all computation on logic sandwitched between registers must
finish within the frequency of a predetermined reference operation clock.However, as shown in the timing chart of Fig. 17, in reality, while logic
computation is carried out at a one-clock frequency T, i.e., the frequency of a
reference operation clock, data computation functionlogic ALU between a register
reg-A and a register reg-B occasionally requires an especially long three-clock
frequency 3T. The data computation family such as the functionlogic ALU is
called a multi-clock transfer path in which register-to-register data transfer does
not complete within a one-clock frequency but a computation time lingers over
a multi-clock period. In Fig. 17,
