<ABSTRACT>
Described herein is a method to detect 
global displacements between pairs of images to sub-pixel 

accuracy using a vernier approach in which a 
global displacement vector is obtained to pixel 

accuracy using phase correlation techniques and a 
fractional correction is obtained using a spatial-domain 

matching technique, such as cross-correlation.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to the 
detection of global translations between images and is 
more particularly concerned with a digital processing 
method for such detection to sub-pixel accuracy 
between images which are related either temporally or 
spatially. Images may, for example, comprise part or 
all of a time-varying sequence, or the colour 
separations of a single image. Typical applications 
for the method of the present invention include the 
automatic detection and correction, to high accuracy, 
of spatial unsteadiness occurring in a time-varying 
sequence of images which have originated from motion 
picture film, the automatic alignment of pairs of 
images of the same subject taken at different times, 
and the automatic registration of colour separations 
of a single image. There are two classes of algorithms by which 
spatial translation can be measured, the first 
relating to the use of non-image information, for 
example, the position of sprocket holes or the frame 
edge or the use of fiducial marks, and the second 
depending on the use of the information content within 
the image The second class of algorithms can be 
referred to as 'motion estimation' algorithms. The 
present invention belongs to this second class. Motion estimation algorithms have the 
advantage of versatility in this particular 
application. They can be implemented on any image set 
independent of its source or history. Motion estimation algorithms may be broadly 
divided into three types:-  These are described in "A Hardware Motion 
Compensator for a Videoconferencing Codec", I Parke 
and D G Morrison, and "Motion-compensated Field Rate 
Conversion for HDTV Display", G M X Fernando, both 
from IEEE Colloquium "Motion Compensated Image 
Processing", Digest 1987/86, and "The Development of 
an HDTV to PAL Standards Converter", T Ohmura, IBC86 
Conference Proceedings, pages 221 to 224. In this method, the matching is implemented 
in the spatial domain, based on either maximum cross-correlation 
or minimum mean square error. The method 
is amenable to efficient hardware implementation by 
the application of hierarchical searching techniques. These are described in "Motion Estimation 
for Frame-rate Conversion", E A Krause, MIT PhD 
Thesis, ATRP-T-70 (1987). The method used here is based on the 
assumption that movement occurs along paths of 
constant luminance. Thus, if luminance, L, is a 
function of spatial position, (x,y) and time, t, it is 
required that:-

<CLAIMS>
A method of detecting global 
translations between two images comprising the steps 

of:- 

a) generating at least one displacement 
vector using phase correlation techniques indicative 

of the translation between the two images to pixel 
accuracy; 
b) selecting a single vector which most 
accurately represents the global translation between 

the two images; 
c) generating a set of matching terms in 
the spatial domain centred around the selected vector; 

and 
d) interpolating the matching terms to 
provide detection to sub-pixel accuracy. 
A method according to claim 1, wherein 
step b) includes applying a threshold to the at least 

one displacement vector to provide an indication of 
suitable vector(s). 
A method according to claim 1 or 2,
