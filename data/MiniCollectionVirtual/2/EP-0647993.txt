<CLAIMS>
A carbon brush which is impregnated with a polyether
siloxane or polymethyl siloxane by way of impregnating

agent, in particular a carbon brush for heavily
stressed tools,

characterised in that

the polyether siloxane exhibits the following
structure:


with R = polyether, and
in that the modified polymethyl siloxane exhibits the
following structure:


with R = alkylaryl
or in that the modified polymethyl siloxane exhibits
the following structure:


with R = alkyl or alkyl + polyether.
Carbon brush according to Claim 1,

characterised in that

the polymethyl siloxane is modified by long-chain
alkyl and/or alkylaryl residues.
Carbon brush according to at least one of the
preceding claims,

characterised in that

the impregnated carbon brush contains 0.5 to 15 wt.%
impregnating agent.
Process for impregnating a carbon brush or a carbon
bar,

characterised in that

the carbon brush or the carbon bar is impregnated in
an emulsion containing polyether siloxane or

polymethyl siloxane by way of impregnating agent;
whereby the polyether siloxane and the polymethyl

siloxane exhibit the structures defined in Claim 1.
Process according to Claim 4,

characterised in that

the emulsion contains water by way of emulsifier.
Process according to at least one of the preceding
claims,

characterised in that

the carbon brush or the carbon bar is immersed in the
emulsion containing the impregnating agent over a

period of time t with, preferably, 0.5 
<
 t 
<
 5 h at a
temperature of about 50 °C to 90 °C, preferably about

80 °C, excess emulsion is then removed by draining
off, and finally drying is effected at a temperature T

with, preferably, 50 °C 
<
 T 
<
 90 °C. 
Process according to at least one of the preceding
claims,

characterised in that

the carbon brush or the carbon bar is spun during
drying.
