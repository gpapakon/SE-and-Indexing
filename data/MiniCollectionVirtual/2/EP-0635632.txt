<ABSTRACT>
An internal flow mixer (12) is attached to the rearward end of a 
turbofan engine (10) for 

inverting the engine fan (22) and core streams (24). Rearwardly of the 
internal flow mixer (12) is a multi-lobed 

exhaust nozzle (14) which mixes ambient air with the gases flowing 
from the flow mixer (12). 

An ejector housing (16) lined with acoustic absorption material receives 
the flow from the 

exhaust nozzle (14) and discharges the thrust producing gases in noise 
abatement condition.

<DESCRIPTION>
Noise generated by aircraft jet engines during takeoff and landing is a matter of 
serious concern in most metropolitan areas of the world. In the United States alone, 
approximately five million people live or work adjacent to airports and are affected 
significantly by aircraft noise. Many municipalities have taken action to require reduction 
in aircraft noise. Much work has been done on designing turbofan aircraft engines to 
reduce noise levels. For background information relating to noise reduction systems for 
jet engines, reference may be had to the following U.S. Patent Numbers 3,710,890; 
4,077,206; 4,117,671; 4,501,393; 4,909,346; 5,060,471; 5,127,602 and 5,167,118. These 
patents are incorporated herein by reference. It generally can be said that in turbofan jet aircraft engines, the engine airflow is 
split into two parts as it passes through the engine, i.e. the primary or core flow and the 
fan or bypass flow. The primary or core flow passes through the low pressure and high 
pressure compressors and into the combustion chamber where fuel is mixed with the high 
pressure air and burned. The core flow then passes through the high and low pressure 
turbines and into the exhaust duct. The fan or bypass air flow only passes through the 
fan and is routed around the core engine and into the exhaust duct. In low bypass ratio 
confluent turbofan nacelles, the two flows enter into the exhaust duct at approximately 
equal pressure but at much different temperatures (approximately 110°C (230°F) for the bypass  
 
flow and approximately 593°C (1100°F) for the core flow). Unless mixed, the two flows remain 
substantially separate as they exhaust through the tailpipe of the jet engine. The hot core 
flow exits the engine at very high velocity which is much greater than the velocity of the 
fan gas. This hot core gas generates a large part of the engine jet noise. One apparatus which has been developed and which has achieved beneficial 
results in the noise reduction of turbofan aircraft engines is the flow mixer of the multichannel 
or multi-lobe inverted flow type. Examples of use of such mixers for noise 
suppression are found in the previously referenced patent numbers 4,117,671 and 
4,077,206. These flow mixers mix the two gas flows to more or less cause all the gas 
flowing through the tailpipe to flow at the same velocity. These flow mixers have been 
credited with noise reduction in the range of 3.5 to 4.5 decibels (Db) in the Effective 
Perceived Noise Level (EPNL), depending upon the engine

A noise suppression system for use with a turbofan 
engine having, at its exhaust end, fan flow and core flow 

streams, the suppression system comprising:
