<ABSTRACT>
A television receiver having an electronically controlled 
tuner is presented. A controlled local oscillator (42) provides a local 

oscillator signal for the mixer (18). The controlled local oscillator 
(42) includes an first input terminal for receiving a control signal for 

controlling its frequency and a first output terminal for providing an 
output local oscillator signal. A phase-locked loop (16) includes a 

second input terminal for receiving the local oscillator signal and a 
second output terminal for providing a signal back to the first input 

terminal of the controlled local oscillator for controlling its frequency. 
At least a portion of the coupling between the first output terminal 

and the second input terminal, and the second output terminal and 
the first input terminal, have a common line (50).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention generally concerns a negative feedback
control circuit having a common line for input and output signals, and
more particularly, a television receiver tuner having a local oscillator
which is controlled by a phase-locked loop.Television receivers include a tuner section for
heterodyning in a mixer received signals, e.g., broadcast or cable RF
signals, to produce an intermediate frequency (IF) signal. The IF signal
is processed by the IF signal section and the picture and sound
components are further processed by respective signal processing
sections to produce a video picture signal for displaying an image on a
CRT, and to produce an audio signal for producing an audio response by
a loudspeaker.The US-A-4,160,213 discloses a circuit to compensate the mixer injection
voltage. The known circuit addresses the problem that FET mixers have a conversion gain
that is dependent not only on the bias conditions of the FET, but also on the amplitudes of
the local oscillator signals coupled to it. When a voltage controlled oscillator utilizing a
varacter diode is utilized its output signals exhibit relatively large amplitude variations
throughout the frequency range. In this circuit the tuning voltage and the output from the
local oscillator are applied to different input and output nodes.In other known devices the tuner section includes at least one controlled local
oscillator and at least one RF amplifier wherein both have voltage
controlled tuning circuits controlled in response to the magnitude of a
tuning voltage (TV), generated in the exemplary embodiment by the
PLL, responsive to the selected channel. Typically the tuned circuits
include combinations of inductors and varactor diodes which are
reverse biased so as to exhibit a variable capacitive reactance having a
value determined by the magnitude of the tuning voltage. Phase locked loop (PLL) tuning systems employ a closed loop
negative feedback arrangement for controlling the frequency of the
local oscillator signal. The closed loop arrangement includes
programmable digital counters as programmable frequency dividers by
which a signal is generated which is the frequency to the local
oscillator signal divided by a programmable factor related to the
selected channel. The programmable frequency divider can be
preceded by an optional prescaler circuit which frequency divides the
incoming signal by a constant factor. As used herein, functional
statements referring to frequency division, prescaler, and frequency
dividers are independent of
