<ABSTRACT>
The disclosure describes a process for preparing 
diacetoxybutene, which comprises:

 
   reacting butadiene, acetic acid and oxygen in the 

presence of a palladium-based catalyst;
 

   feeding continuously the resulting reaction product 
into a first distillation tower to distill off by-product 

water and unreacted acetic acid from the top of the first 
distillation tower;

 
   withdrawing bottoms which contain mainly 

diacetoxybutene, from the bottom of the first distillation 
tower;

 
   feeding continuously the withdrawn bottoms withdrawn 

from the first distillation tower into a second 
distillation tower for distilling out and recovering 

diacetoxybutene from the top of the second distillation 
tower;

 
   withdrawing bottoms containing high boiling point 

materials from the bottom of the second distillation tower, 
so that the content of the high boiling point materials in 

the bottoms of the second distillation tower is not more 
than 20 wt%;

 
   feeding continuously the withdrawn bottoms into a 

thin-film evaporator whose internal pressure is kept lower 
than the bottom pressure of the second distillation tower 

to carry out evaporation treatment; and
 

 
   recycling the evaporated materials mainly containing 

diacetoxybutene into the second distillation tower.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a process for 
preparing diacetoxybutene. Diacetoxybutene is an important 
raw material for the production of 1,4-butanediol and 
tetrahydrofuran which are utilized as a solvent or 
synthetic resin material. Diacetoxybutene is usually produced by reacting 
butadiene, acetic acid and oxygen in the presence of a 
palladium catalyst. It is necessary to separate 
diacetoxybutene from the acetoxylation reaction product, 
but some problems are involved in this process. Since both 
of the unreacted materials and diacetoxybutene contained in 
the reaction product have unsaturated groups (unsaturated 
radicals), there can be generated polymeric substances as a 
by-product depending on the treatment involved, and such 
generation of the polymeric substances as a by-product may 
become a cause of decrease of yield or operational 
impediment. On pages 359 and 366-367 of "Procédés de Pétrochemie", Tome 
2, 2e Ed. 1986, Ed. "TECHNIP", a process for preparing 
diacetoxybutene is described by reacting butadeine, acetic 
acid and oxygen in the presence of a Pd/Te-based catalyst. The 
reaction products are subsequently separated from the catalyst 
and divided into liquid and vapor phase fractions. The liquid 
fraction is then further separated into the different reaction 
products by a 4-column distillation process.  
 Another process for the production of diacetoxybutene is 
disclosed in DE-A-2 627 001. The process disclosed therein 
involves the same educts as mentioned above in the presence of 
a palladium catalyst. After separation from the vapor phase 
fraction of the reaction products, the liquid phase thereof is 
distilled in a first distillation column, thereby recovering 
unreacted butadiene. The bottoms of the column is further 
distilled in another column to recover acetic acid and the 
bottoms, which contain the acetoxybutene fraction are 
forwarded to a third distillation column, wherein purfied 
acetoxybutene is obtained as the top fraction therein. Japanese Patent Application Laid-Open (KOKAI) No. 50-121210 
(corresponding to U. S. Patent No. 4,057,472) 
teaches that diacetoxybutene can exist in relatively stable 
when distillation for separating diacetoxybutene from the 
said reaction product is carried out by controlling the 
pressure within the distillation tower while maintaining  
 
the temperature of the bottom of the distillation tower at 
lower than 190°C, and as a result, the above-mentioned 
problems have been solved. However, for separating and recovering
