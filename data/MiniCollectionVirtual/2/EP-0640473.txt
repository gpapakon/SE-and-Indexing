<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a pre-proof temperature
controlling assembly associated with an off-press
apparatus for laminating an image sheet to an image
receiving substrate and, more particularly, for
laminating a plurality of image sheets to the receiving
substrate and then laminating a portion of the receiving
substrate to a display sheet.Reproduction of color images through printing is
an involved process requiring a breakdown of an original
image into a number of fundamental single color images
and the eventual recombination of the single color images
through multiple printings into a full color reproduction
of the original. Color image reproduction typically
includes the following steps.First, using filtering and other photographic
techniques a number of color separation transparencies or
color separations are produced, typically four, each
bearing a halftone dot and/or a continuous tone (contone)
image corresponding, for instance, to magenta, cyan,
yellow and black portions of the original. Second, a
printing plate is made for each color separation by
exposing a sensitized plate through one of the
transparencies and developing the plate. Third, the
printing plates are mounted on a multistage printing
press which prints inks on a substrate, typically paper,
sequentially and in register, one on top of another, four
halftone and/or contone images corresponding to each of
the color separations to create a full color reproduction
of the original. In the case of halftone images, the various
colors are reproduced by the superposition of a
multiplicity of dots of varying diameters and colors
corresponding to the four color separations. Any
deviation in the size or position of the printed dots
results in color shifts in the final printed image. As a
result of this reproduction process, setting up the press
and printing a four color image is economically feasible
typically only when employed for printing large
quantities of a given original.It is desirable to be able to predict the final
image appearance before it is printed, and preferably
before making printing plates by reviewing images made
directly from the color separation transparencies. The
art of evaluating the color separation transparencies and
deciding whether the various colors have indeed been
properly separated is called proofing. Proofing is a
process which uses the color separations to create a
colored image called a proof to visualize what the final
printed image will look like typically without actually
making printing plates and running
