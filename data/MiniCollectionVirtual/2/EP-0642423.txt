<ABSTRACT>
An apparatus for the illumination of points on a medium comprises a perforated wall which is illuminated by substantially collimated optical energy at a centre wavelength ( lambda ). The optical energy passes through the perforations and illuminates the medium which is arranged at a distance (L) therefrom. The perforations have a cross section such that the optical energy is diffracted, and diverging bundles of rays are created. The medium is located in a region around the transition between the Fresnel region and the Fraunhofer region of the bundles of rays. Points on the surface of the medium are illuminated selectively by a source of light through a large number of illumination channels. Each of these channels comprises an optical lens element for intensifying the optical energy received from the light source, a selectively controlled optical valve permitting or preventing optical energy from propagating through the channel, and a channel outlet which, together with the other elements in the means, defines the size of the point formed by the channel. The channels are controlled individually by the central control unit, which is electrically connected to each of the selectively controlled optical valves for selective control of the energy transmission of each channel.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention concerns a method and an apparatus for illuminating 
points on a medium, said method and said apparatus 
being of the type defined in the characterizing portion 
of claim 1, respectively. In a preferred embodiment 
the apparatus of the invention is used for selective illumination 
of points on the surface of a medium, and said 
apparatus may comprise a central control unit having a 
store in which the information on a desired illumination 
pattern is stored. It is known to expose photosensitive media with light to 
transfer information to it. This was originally done by 
illuminating the medium through a partly transparent original 
containing the desired information. To rationalize 
this process techniques have subsequently been developed, 
where a laser beam scans the medium for exposure, while 
the laser beam is modulated for the medium to obtain the 
correct illumination in all points. The information on the 
illumination pattern of the medium is now contained in a 
central control unit and is used for modulating the laser. 
For a satisfactory image quality to be obtained on the 
medium, the mechanical system retaining the original and 
the light source with respect to each other during exposure 
must satisfy strict stability requirements. For the 
required accuracy to be obtained, the medium for exposure 
is often arranged in a device of the type usually called 
"Internal Laser Image Drum Plotter". Devices of this type 
are described i.a. in US patent specifications 4 852 709, 
4 595 957 and 3 958 250. Devices of this type provide a 
satisfactory image quality, but they have a very complex 
mechanical structure, because the light source and the 
medium are to be moved very accurately with respect to  
 
each other. Consequently, devices of this type have a 
relatively high cost price, which puts a limit to the 
number of users. A method and apparatus according to the precharacterising 
portions of claims 1 and 2, respectively, is known from US-A-4 664 524. The object of the invention is therefore to provide a 
method of the type stated in the opening paragraph for 
illuminating points on a medium, where the apparatus is 
based on simpler and fewer mechanical components. This object is obtained as stated in the characterizing 
portion of claim 1 by using proximity focusing in the exposure 
of the medium, as stated there, i.e. the medium 
exposed with the light is spaced very closely from an 
aperture or a pinhole causing diffraction of the light. It 
is a relatively undescribed
