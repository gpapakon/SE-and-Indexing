<ABSTRACT>
An outerlining fabric (1) woven of warp threads (5a, 5b, 
5c) and a weft thread (6) and including at least two fastener 

portions (3, 3) composed of a male or a female member of a surface-type 
separable fastener, and a mesh portion (2) of a predetermined 

width disposed between the fastener portions (3, 3) to separate 
them in the widthwise direction of the outerlining fabric (1), 

the weft thread (6) being composed of a synthetic resin monofilament 
having a rigidity greater than that of any of the warp threads 

(5a, 5b, 5c). The outerlining fabric (1) is attached to and along 
the top edge of a curtain (10), and when the curtain (10) is to be 

attached to a curtain rail (20), a series of curtain attachment 
connector members (42) each having a fastener surface (43) are attached 

to either of the fastener portions (3) of the outerlining 
fabric (1). With the outerlining fabric (1), the vertical position 

of the curtain (10) relative to the curtain rail (20) can be 
changed among at least two positions. Due to the rigidity of the 

monofilament in the outerlining fabric (1), the top edge of the 
curtain (10) is always held in an upstanding position even when 

the curtain attachment connectors (40) is attached to the lower 
fastener portion (3).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates generally to various
curtains for domestic and commercial uses including blackout
curtains for theaters and hospitals, and more particularly
to a outerlining fabric attached to the top edge of a curtain
for enabling attachment of the curtain relative to a curtain
rail selectively at a first position in which the curtain
rail is exposed from the curtain, or at a second position in
which the curtain rail is concealed with the curtain, and
also to a curtain attachment structure using the outerlining
fabric.In general, a curtain includes a outerlining fabric
made of a tough woven cloth and attached to a top edge of
the curtain to reinforce a suspended portion of the curtain
which is subjected to a maximum external force and also to
straighten the form of the suspended portion. The outerlining
fabric has a plurality of hook-attachment portions formed at
predetermined intervals along the length of the outerlining
fabric. To attach the curtain to a curtain rail, a plurality 
of metal hooks are first attached to the corresponding hook-attachment
portions of the outerlining fabric and then hooked
one by one on the hooks or rings of curtain runners which
have been slidably mounted on the curtain rail.In attaching a curtain to a curtain rail, a need
may arise that the vertical relative position between the
curtain and the curtain rail be changed. For example, when
the curtain rail used is highly decorative, the decorative
curtain rail will preferably be exposed from the upper edge
of the curtain. In this case, the hooks are attached to the
top edge of the curtain. On the other hand, when the curtain
rail needs to be concealed with the top edge of the curtain,
hooks must be attached to a portion of the curtain located
somewhat below the top edge of the curtain.However, since the hook-attachment portions of the
curtain are generally arranged in a single horizontal row,
to meet the desire to change the vertical position of the
curtain relative to the curtain rail, a set of hooks of an
appropriate length is selected out among a plurality of
previously prepared sets of hooks of different lengths.In recent years, the demand for curtains has greatly
increased, and replacement and laundering of the curtains
have become frequent. To improve the efficiency of a curtain
replacement work, various attempts have been proposed
to facilitate attachment/detachment of the curtain relative 
to curtain runners mounted on the curtain rail. For example,
according to curtain attachment connectors disclosed

<CLAIMS>
An elongated outerlining fabric (1) adapted to be attached
to a curtain (10) along a top edge thereof, said outerlining fabric (1)

being woven of a plurality of types of warp threads (5a, 5b, 5c)
running lengthwise of said outerlining fabric (1) and a weft thread (6)

running widthwise of said outerlining fabric (1), said outerlining
fabric (1) including a fastener portion (3) having a woven structure

and extending lengthwise of said elongated outerlining fabric (1), said
fastener portion (3) being composed of one of a pair of male and

female surface-type separable fastener members, characterized in that
at least one fastener portion (3) is disposed at a position off the

longitudinal center line near one edge which extends longitudinally
of said outerlining fabric (1), that a mesh portion (2) having a net-like

woven structure is disposed on at least one side adjacent to said
fastener portion (3), and that said weft thread (6) is composed of a

synthetic resin monofilament having a rigidity greater than that of said
warp threads (5a, 5b, 5c).

2, wherein at least two said fastener portions (3, 3) are provided and

spaced in the widthwise direction of said outerlining fabric (1) via
said mesh portion (2). 
An elongated outerlining fabric (1) according to one of
claims 1 to 3, wherein said fastener portion (3) is continuous and

extends throughout the length of said outerlining fabric (1).
