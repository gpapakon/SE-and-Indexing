<ABSTRACT>
A video disk recorder for executing real-time 
editing records desired scenes to a disk (11) while 

allowing an operator to observe a relay video image that 
is currently in progress. In response to the generation 

of a recording command signal, a recording head (13) is 
set to a recording mode and a disk address of the 

recording head (13) at that time is stored as a 
determinate disk 
address. In response to the generation 
of a stop command signal, the recording mode is 

cancelled and a disk address of the recording head (13) 
at that time is stored as a temporary disk address. In 

the case where a skip command signal is generated during 
the recording mode, the recording head (13) is moved to 

the determinate disk address stored at the time of the 
start of the recording mode. In the case where the skip 

command signal is generated in a mode other than the 
recording mode, the recording head is moved to the 

temporary disk address.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a video disk recorder and,
more particularly, to a video disk recorder for
selectively recording only desired scenes while a relay
video image is being displayed for the purpose of
confirmation.For example, in television news programs of the
day's sports events, certain important scenes are
replayed as a highlight scene. It is impossible to
forecast the time when such an important scene will occur
in the relay broadcast of a baseball or the like. To
replay such a scene, therefore, an editing work is
performed such that the recording operation of such relay
video images is continued from the beginning to the end
and all of the game contents are recorded to a video tape
or the like and, after completion of the game, scenes to
be replayed are selected while reproducing the recorded
video tape (master tape) and the selected scenes are
sequentially recorded onto the video tape for the
highlight scenes. With this scheme, desired replay scenes
can be promptly reproduced from the video tape for the
highlight scenes. However, generally two or more hours are expended
for almost all of the baseball games, and the recording
to the master tape is executed for a long time. This has
been causing a problem that a large amount of labors are
expended for the editing operation for selecting some of
desired scenes to be replayed from among the recorded
scenes of a long time.The method described above is a method in which the
master tape to record all of the relay video images has
been prepared beforehand, then desired scenes are
selected from the master tape. It is, however, also
conceivable to adopt the following method in which only
desired scenes are selected and recorded while recording
the relay video images to the master tape by using a VDR
(Video Disk Recorder).In the method in which only a desired scenes are
selected and recorded while recording the relay video
images to the master tape, by using the VDR, a desired
scene can be selected while confirming the relay video
images, so that an editing operation amount for the
selection can be remarkably reduced as compared with the
method whereby the master tape to record all of the relay
video images is previously formed and, subsequently
desired scenes are selected from the master tape.The method mentioned above, however, has the
following problems. Namely, the operations for such a method are complicated because various
operation commands must be generated after the set of cue numbers. Particularly, it
requires busy editing operations such

<CLAIMS>
A video disk recorder having a real-time editing function, comprising:

recording means (16), including moving means for moving a recording head
(13) in a radial direction of a re-recordable disc (11), for recording a video signal to

said disk by said recording head;
reading means for reading the address on said disk which corresponds to the
position of said recording head on said disk; and
control means (21) for performing the operations of:
setting, in response to the generation of a recording command signal, said
recording head to a recording mode and storing the present address of said recording

head as a determined disk address;
cancelling, in response to the generation of a stop command signal, said
recording mode and storing the current address of said recording head as a temporary

disk address;
moving, in cases where a skip command signal is generated in said recording
mode, said recording head to said determined disk address; and
moving, in cases where said skip command signal is generated in a mode other
than said recording mode, said recording head to said temporary disk address.
A video disk recorder according to claim 1, wherein, in cases where said skip
command signal is generated in a reproducing mode which was set at said determined

disk address, said control means moves said recording head to said temporary disk
address.
