<ABSTRACT>
A positive displacement machine for compressible media has a displacer which is held in such a way on a disc-shaped rotor (1) which is eccentrically drivable with respect to the casing, that during operation each of its points carries out a circular movement. To this end, there is arranged on a drive shaft (24) an eccentric disc (23) on which the rotor (1) is supported by means of an oil-lubricated bearing arrangement (22). The lubricating oil is supplied and discharged on the side facing away from the drive side of the drive shaft (24), the separation of the oil inflow (29) from the oil return flow (57) being effected in the casing (7a) by a plain bearing (sleeve bearing, journal) (18) which at both ends has one oil chamber (54, 55) each. The separation of the oil streams is effected by a recess (30) which does not extend over the entire length of the plain bearing (18). By means of this recess, the plain bearing (18) is likewise supplied with oil. The recess (30) connects the oil inflow hole (29) in the casing (7a) to the oil chamber (54).

Displacement machine for compressible media, with 
a plurality of spiral conveying spaces (11a, 11b) 

arranged in a stationary housing (7a, 7b) and with a 
displacement body (1-4) which is assigned to the conveying 

spaces and which is held on a disc-shaped rotor (1) 
drivable eccentrically relative to the housing, in such 

a way that, during operation, each of its points executes 
a circular movement limited by the circumferential walls 

of the conveying spaces, for which purpose there is 
arranged on a drive shaft (24), having a driven end and 

an end facing away from this, an eccentric disc (23), on 
which the rotor (1) is mounted by means of an oil-lubricated 

mounting (22), characterized in that the 
housing side, in which the end of the drive shaft (24) 

facing away is located, has an oil inflow (29) and an oil 
return (57), through which lubricating oil for the oil-lubricated 

mounting (22) can be supplied and discharged, 
and in that a sliding bearing (18) for the end of the 

drive shaft (24) facing away is provided in the housing 

(7a) between the oil inflow (29) and the oil return (57) 
for the throttling and quantity regulation of the fed-in 

oil, the sliding bearing (18) having an oil space (54, 
55) at each of the two ends. 
Displacement machine according to Claim 1, 
characterized in that the separation of the oil stream 

takes place by means of a depression (30) not extending 
over the entire length of the sliding bearing (18), and 

in that the sliding bearing (18) is also supplied with 
oil by means of this depression, the depression (30) 

connecting the oil-inflow bore (29) in the housing (7a) 
to the oil space (54). 
Displacement machine according to Claim 2, 
characterized in that the division of the oil streams in 

the drive shaft (24) takes place by means of a 
rotationally symmetrical sleeve (39) pressed into a 

longitudinal bore (53) and having a narrowed middle part 
(62) press fits of the sleeve (39) being located at its 

ends (58, 58'), thereby forming in the drive shaft (24)  
 

two coaxial oil ducts (59, 60), the length of which is 
dimensioned in such a way that the radial bores (31, 33) 

open into the ducts (59, 60) for the supply of the 
bearing (22).
