<ABSTRACT>
A liquefied gas ship has a hull and a substantially 
rectangular gas storage tank (1) whose outer surface is 

covered with an insulation material (6) and which is 
supported by a plurality of tank supports (2) arranged on 

the bottom of the inner shell (3) of the hull. Drainers 
(18) for discharging leaked liquid from the space between 

the tank (1) and the insulation material (6) are provided 
at least at each of the four corners of the lower surface 

of the insulation material below the tank. A drip tray 
(19) is arranged below each of the drainers (18) and 

sealing means (20) is arranged between each tank support 
(2) and the insulation material (6).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to liquefied gas ships and 
is concerned with that type of such ship which has a hull 
and a substantially rectangular gas storage tank whose 
outer surface is covered with an insulation material and 
which is supported by a plurality of tank supports 
arranged on the bottom of the hull. A liquefied gas ship typically has the structure shown in 
Figure 1, which is a diagrammatic transverse cross-sectional 
view, in which a tank body 1 made of aluminium 
alloy is covered on its outer surface with a relatively 
hard insulation material 6, such as polyurethane foam, 
and is supported by a plurality of heat insulating tank 
supports 2 which in turn are arranged on the bottom of 
the inner shell 3 of a double shell hull. Since the tank 
body 1 expands and contracts due to the temperature 
changes caused by the absence or presence of liquefied 
gas in it, to attach or bond the edges of the insulation 
material 6 to the tank supports 2 would cause the 
material 6 to be distorted and thus damaged. The 
material 6, which is directly mounted on the tank body 1, 
is therefore, not attached or bonded at its edges to the 
tank supports 2. Instead, as shown in Figure 2, which is 
a diagrammatic sectional view on an enlarged scale of one 
of the tank supports shown in Figure 1, a heat insulating 
material 16, such as glass wool, is filled between the 
edge of the material 6 and the tank support 2 to prevent 
the transmission of external heat to the tank body 1 
through the gap which would otherwise be present between 
the edge of the material 6 and the tank support 2. In the event of leakage of liquefied gas stored at 
extremely low temperature in the tank body 1, the inner 
shell 3 may be exposed to the leaked liquid thus brought 
to a very low temperature, thereby becoming brittle. In 
order to overcome this, it has been proposed that the  
 
inner shell 3 be made of the same material as the tank 
body 1 or that a trough 17 be arranged as shown by 
phantom lines in Figure 2, to receive any liquefied gas 
which leaks to the outer periphery of the tank support 2. However, to make the inner shell 3 of the same material 
as the tank body 1 would very substantially increase the 
cost of constructing the liquefied gas ship and this is 
therefore essentially impracticable. The provision of a 
trough 17 for each tank support 2 is also extremely 
uneconomical. In the light of the above it is the object of the present 
invention to provide a liquefied gas ship with a hull 
protection system which

<CLAIMS>
A liquefied gas ship having a hull and a 
substantially rectangular gas storage tank whose outer 

surface is covered with an insulation material and which 
is supported by a plurality of tank supports arranged on 

the bottom of the hull, characterised by drainers (18) 
for discharging leaked liquid from the space between the 

tank (1) and the insulation material (6), a drainer (18) 
being mounted at least at each of the four corners of the 

lower surface of the insulation material below the tank, 
a drip tray (19) arranged below each drainer and sealing 

means (20) between each tank support (2) and the 
insulation material (6). 
A ship as claimed in claim 1, characterised in that 
a horizontal projection (5) is formed or provided on the 

outer periphery of each tank support (2) intermediate its 
ends, the upper surface (10) of the projection (5) 

engaging a downwardly facing surface of the insulation 
material (6). 
A ship as claimed in claim 2 characterised in that 
the underside (8) of the projection (5) is coplanar with 

the underside (12) of the insulation material (6). 
A ship as claimed in claim 3, characterised in that 
the insulation material (6) is relatively hard and that 

further insulating material (14), which is relatively 
soft, is arranged on the underside of the hard insulation 

material (6) and is bonded to the side surface of the 
projection (5). 
A ship as claimed in any one of claims 2 to 4,  
 

characterised in that liquid-sealing tape is attached or 
applied to the underside of the adjacent edges of the 

projection (5) and of the insulating material (6) or the 
insulating material (14) and bridges the joint between 

them. 
A ship as claimed in any one of the preceding 
claims, characterised in that heat insulating material, 

such as glass fibre (16) is situated between the adjacent 
side surfaces of the insulating material (6) and the tank 

support (2). 
A ship as claimed in any one of the preceding 
claims, characterised in that an inwardly extending 

flange (21) for preventing splashing of leaked liquid is 
provided on the upper edge of each drip tray (19), that 

partition plates (22) in the form of a lattice are 
arranged within the drip tray on its base and that a 

plurality of heat insulating supports (23) is interposed 
between the drip tray and the hull (3).
