<ABSTRACT>
A pneumatic radial tire for heavy duty vehicles 
comprises a radial carcass (1), a belt (4), a belt 

reinforcing layer (5; 5a, 5b) and a tread (6), in which 
the belt is formed by a zigzag and continuously 

extending rubberized strip (8) containing one or more 
cords (7) therein, and the belt reinforcing layer is 

constituted by arranging a rubberized cord ply in a 
region corresponding to at least a side region of the 

tread, and the belt and the belt reinforcing layer 
satisfy a ratio h/h
O
 of not more than 65%. In the 
tire of the above structure, the occurrence of shoulder 

wear is controlled together with the avoidance of belt 
end separation and the durability is improved.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to pneumatic radial 
tires, and more particularly to a pneumatic heavy duty 
radial tire for use with trucks and buses under a high 
internal pressure which avoids separation failure at the 
belt end by specifying the arrangement of cords 
constituting the belt. As this type of the tire, JP-Y-48-96259 
discloses a tire wherein a belt having no cut surface of 
cord at its end is formed by bending cords slantly 
extended with respect to an equatorial plane of the tire 
at a widthwise end of the belt so as to zigzag extend in 
a circumferential direction of the tire for avoiding the 
occurrence of separation failure at the belt end. In such a belt, the cords are crossed with each 
other at the widthwise end of the belt and continuously 
extended at a bent state, so that there is caused no 
cord shifting between upper and lower belt layers at the 
belt end and hence the stretching of the belt end in the 
circumferential direction is very small as compared with  
 
the conventional belt structure wherein rubberized cord 
plies having a given width are laminated one upon the 
other so as to cross the cords of the upper and lower 
plies with each other. This is particularly conspicuous 
when using high elastic cords such as steel cord 
and the like. On the other hand, the distance or diameter from 
the rotational axis of the tire to the outer surface of a 
tread is smaller at a widthwise end of the tread than at the 
widthwise central portion of the tread, i.e. there is 
a difference in diameter between the tread end and the tread 
center, so that a shearing deformation in the circumferential 
direction is apt to be caused at the widthwise 
end of the tread locating within a ground contact area 
during running under load in the case of heavy duty 
pneumatic tires for trucks and buses having a large 
diameter difference. The shearing deformation creates a 
large slipping between the tread end surface and the road 
surface, and consequently bring about a so-called 
shoulder wear wherein the tread end is prematurely worn as 
compared with the other portion of the tread. To this 
end, the belt cord plies are laminated one upon the 
other so as to cross the cords of the upper and lower 
plies with each other, whereby stretching of the 
belt end in the circumferential direction is ensured to 
absorb the diameter difference between the central  
 
portion of the tread in the widthwise direction and the 
widthwise end thereof. However, when a belt having a very small 
stretching in the

idally extending between a pair of bead cores 
(2a, 2b), a belt (4) superimposed about the carcass, and 

a tread (6) laid thereon, the belt (4) being formed by a 
zigzag and continuously extending rubberized strip (8) 

containing one or more cords (7) therein substantially 
in the circumferential direction of the tread so as to 

slantly extend with respect to an equatorial plane (O)

edges of the belt through a bent state at each side 
edge; characterized in that a belt reinforcing layer (5; 

5a; 5b) is laid between the belt and the tread, and the 
belt reinforcing layer (5; 5a, 5b) is constituted by
