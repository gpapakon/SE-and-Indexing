<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a method of fitting an overload coil (44) for a 
circuit breaker onto a bobbin assembly (24). The overload coil is preformed 

into a helical coil (44) with a pair of terminals (16, 17) and a 
coil sub-assembly (76) is formed by attaching electrical leads (42) to the 

terminals of the coil. Separate base and top halves (26, 28) of a split 
bobbin are assembled so that the pre-formed coil of the coil subassembly 

is held captive therebetween. A sensing tube (18) is fitted 
through an aperture extending axially through the assembled split 

bobbin, and the sensing tube is mounted onto a magnetic cradle. 
Different top halves, such as a voltage coil top half (46) and a high 

inrush top half (60) may be fitted into a common base half. The 
invention extends to a bobbin assembly for a circuit breaker, as well as 

to an overload coil sub-assembly (76).

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a method of fitting an
overload coil for a circuit breaker onto a bobbin
assembly, as well as to a circuit breaker bobbin
assembly, according to claims 1 and 9 respectively.Circuit breakers generally make use of an overload coil
which is wound onto a bobbin carried on a magnetic frame
within the circuit breaker housing. In the assembly
procedure, a unitary double-flanged bobbin is typically
loaded onto a coil winding machine, and the overload
coil is wound onto the bobbin. The necessary coil
terminations are completed after the coil and bobbin
assembly has been removed from the coil winding machine.
A sensing tube is then passed through the coil and
bobbin assembly, which is in turn mounted on a magnetic
frame.The loading of the bobbin onto the coil winding machine
and the subsequent winding of the coil is a process
which does not lend itself to automation, and
significant setting-up time is required. In addition,
each bobbin has to be manufactured to relatively precise
tolerances in order to ensure that it fits onto the coil
winding machine. Any additional assembly steps which
need to be performed on the overload coil, such as the
application of flexible conductors and the like, have to
be performed with the bobbin already in position.US-A-3,421,127 discloses a two-part relay bobbin which
is used to retain a self-supporting coil or copper
sleeve. The spool comprises a top part in the form of
an inner tube and an integral upper flange member. A
self-supporting coil or copper tube is slid onto the 
inner tube, after which a lower flange member is fitted
to the free end of the tube. Suitable inter-engageable
formations are provided in the lower flanged free end of
the tube for joining the flange directly to the tube in
a snap or click fit so as to hold the coil or copper
sleeve captive.CH 526194 discloses a split bobbin formed from
substantially identical base and top halves. Each of
the halves includes a flange and a tubular semi-hub
extending therefrom, with each of the semi-hubs
terminating in registering formations for preventing
rotation of the semi-hubs when they are brought into
alignment with one another. During manufacture, the two
halves of the bobbin are mounted on a pin in such a way
that the registering formations meet. The two halves
are then rigidly joined to one another by means of an
insulating adhesive tape, glue or welding. Thereafter,
a winding is formed around the pre-assembled bobbin.Both US-A-3,421,127 and CH 526194 relate to relay
coils.According to a
