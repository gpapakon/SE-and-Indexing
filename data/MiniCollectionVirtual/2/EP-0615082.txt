<ABSTRACT>
A continuously variable belt and sheave drive 
mechanism for use with an internal combustion engine in an 

automotive vehicle driveline including a simplified valve 
system that responds to control commands from a 

microprocessor that receives input data from engine, turbine 
and output shaft speed sensors, an engine throttle position 

sensor and a sheave position sensor as well as other 
driveline variables so that the operating characteristics of 

the transmission are matched to the speed torque 
characteristics of the engine to produce improved driveline 

efficiency and performance while permitting the engine speed 
to be related functionally to the throttle position as well 

as vehicle speed and permitting engine speed to increase 
when rapid acceleration is desired while minimizing changes 

in engine speed for small throttle position variations.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a 
vehicle driveline as defined by the features of the 
preamble of claim 1 and 6, respectively, which are 
derivable, for instance, from EP-A 274 080. Our invention relates to improvements in a 
continuously variable belt and sheave drive for automotive 
vehicles such as the infinitely variable drives disclosed in 
U.S. Patent 4,876,920 and U.S. Patent 4,583,423. Each 
of these patents is assigned to the assignee of our 
invention. It is known in the automatic transmission art to 
provide a torque delivery driveline for a vehicle having an 
internal combustion engine wherein a wide range of ratios 
can be obtained to permit the vehicle engine to operate at 
its most efficient speed consistent with its speed torque 
characteristics. With a conventional driveline using 
multiple ratio gearing the engine is allowed to operate at 
each of several speeds depending upon the gearing ratio that 
is selected. With such geared transmissions, the vehicle 
operator controls intake combustion air delivery by 
controlling the engine throttle opening. Each gearing ratio 
then is characterized by a variety of engine speed and 
throttle opening combinations as the vehicle operator 
attempts to match the driveline performance with varying 
driving demands. The engine in such known drivelines is capable of 
achieving its optimum horsepower output throughout only a 
limited range of speeds. Thus, the fuel consumption rate 
will differ if the operating demands require an engine speed 
that is less than or more than its optimum speed. Energy 
efficiency is sacrificed to achieve improved performance.  
 It is known practice to provide an infinitely 
variable transmission in a driveline in combination with an 
internal combustion engine so that torque can be delivered 
to the traction wheels with a continuously variable ratio. 
Such infinitely variable transmissions typically include a 
control system for establishing an actual engine speed that 
is consistent with a so-called target speed at which the 
engine will operate with its most efficient specific fuel 
consumption. Improved fuel efficiency then can be achieved 
throughout the entire range of vehicle speeds made available 
by the infinitely variable driveline. It is known that for each engine net power output 
point, there will exist a throttle position at which the 
specific brake fuel consumption for the engine will be a 
minimum. There are numerous prior art teachings that 
recognize this characteristic of matching an infinitely 
variable
