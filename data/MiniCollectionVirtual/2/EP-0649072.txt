<ABSTRACT>
An image heating apparatus includes a movable 
member having an electrically conductive layer and 

movable with a recording material; an excitation coil 
for producing magnetic flux, which produces eddy 

current in said movable member to generate heat 
therein, and wherein an image on said recording 

material is heated by heat of said movable member; 
wherein said movable member has a low thermal 

conductivity material at a side nearer to said 
excitation coil than the conductive layer.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an image
heating apparatus for heating an image using
electromagnetic induction and eddy current more
particularly to an image heating apparatus suitably
usable for an image fixing apparatus for fixing an
unfixed image in an image forming apparatus such as an
electrophotographic apparatus or electrostatic
recording apparatus or the like.In such an apparatus, the heat is generated
by flowing current through halogen lamp or heat
generating resistor, and the toner is heated through a
roller or film.Japanese Patent Application Publications Nos.
9027/1993 and JP-A-62-150371 propose that eddy current produced in a
cylindrical member by magnetic flux to produce Joule
heat, thus producing heat in the cylindrical member.By using the eddy current, the heat
generating position can be made closer to the toner,
and therefore, the warming up period can be reduced as
compared with the heat roller type using halogen lamp.However, in the Japanese Patent Application
Publication No. 9027/1993, when the Joule heat is
produced by the eddy current, the excitation coil and
the excitation core are heated with the result of 
variation of the magnetic flux density, and therefore,
the amount of heat generation is not stable.If the temperature rise is large, the
excitation coil is deteriorated.Additionally, the thermal efficiency is not
sufficient due to the irradiation into the inside of
the cylindrical member.Accordingly, it is a principal object of the
present invention to provide an image heating
apparatus in which the magnetic flux produced by the
excitation coil is stabilized.It is another object of the present invention
to provide an image heating apparatus in which the
excitation coil is prevented from deteriorating.It is a further object of the present
invention to provide an image heating apparatus having
a high thermal efficiency.The object is achieved by the apparatus defined in claim 1. These and other objects, features and
advantages of the present invention will become more
apparent upon a consideration of the following
description of the preferred embodiments of the
present invention taken in conjunction with the
accompanying drawings.Figure 1 is a sectional view of an image
heating apparatus according to an embodiment of the
present invention.Figure 2 is a perspective view of an
excitation coil and a core material used in the
embodiment of Figure 1.Figure 3 is a sectional view of an image
forming apparatus according to an embodiment of the
present invention.Figure 4 is a sectional
