<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to 1-aryloxy-3-alkylamino-2-propanol 
nitrate esters of general formula I 
to the enantiomers and diastereoisomers and the therapeutically 
acceptable organic and inorganic acids salts thereof; 
where 
R1 is a chain of general formula II 
- (CH2)m - Z - R2where: m is 1 or 2; Z is an -O- ether, or -COO-ester 
function; and R2 is a C2-3 straight or branched chain 
alkyl having at least one ONO2 group as substituent; 
and 
Ar is a benzene ring. As stated above, the invention relates also to therapeutically 
acceptable organic and inorganic acid salts of general 
formula I compounds, such as hydrochlorides, maleates, 
fumarates, oxalates, succinates, etc. The following formula I compounds are of particular 
interest: 
1-isopropylamino-3-[4-(2-nitroxy)ethoxymethyl]phenoxy-2-propanol, 
1-isopropylamino-3-[4-(3-nitroxy)propoxymethyl]phenoxy-2-propanol, 
1-isopropylamino-3-[4-(2,3-dinitroxy)propoxymethyl]phenoxy-2-propanol, 
2-nitroxyethyl 4-[(2-hydroxy-3-isopropylamino)propoxy]phenyl  
 
acetate. One process for the preparation of these compounds, when 
the ether or amide function is present in R1, consists of 
reacting a phenyl derivative of general formula III 
R1 - Ar - OHwhere R1 and Ar have the same meanings as in general formula 
I with an epihalohydrin of general formula IV 
where X may be chlorine or bromine, in an aqueous or hydroalcoholic 
medium, in the presence of a base, preferably an 
alkali hydroxide, to form the epoxide of general formula V 
where R1 and Ar have the same meanings as in general formula 
I, which is finally reacted with isopropylamine VI 
in an inert polar organic, preferably alcoholic, medium to 
give compounds of general formula I. The intermediates of general formula III, the preparation 
of which is not described in this patent, may nevertheless 
be easily prepared by conventional synthesis processes. Where R1 contains an ether function, the starting products 
may be a hydroxyphenyl alcohol and a glycol (GB 
1,041,554; US 4,258,062) to give a hydroxyphenylalkoxy 
alcohol which is treated with fuming nitric acid and acetic 
anhydride, after acetylation in an alkaline medium, to introduce 
the nitroxy function (EP 0 034 461). 
This latter application pertains to similair compounds showing 
α- and β-adrenergic blocking activity, with however no mention of 
coronary dilating activity. The product is finally deacetylated by gentle hydrolysis 
with sodium bicarbonate in a hydroalcoholic medium (J. Am. 
Chem. Soc. 93, 746 (1971). See the following
