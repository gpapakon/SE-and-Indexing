<ABSTRACT>
A fiber bundle is wrapped with a tape by 
helically and entirely winding the tape around the bundle, 

while applying a constant longitudinal tension to the 
bundle; and thereafter unwinding and removing the tape 

from its last turn to gradually expose the bundle towards 
its basal end, while inserting the exposed portion of the 

bundle gradually into a cylindrical protector. The method 
keeps constant the outer diameter of the bundle by 

adjusting the tape tension, even if the bundles are 
composed of varied numbers of fibers in one protector, so 

that a wider use of the protector is realized. In the 
method, the wrapping operation does not produce any 

damaged fibers from which a fluid such as blood leaks in a 
hollow fiber apparatus, and no later adjustment is 

necessary for the wrapped bundles, thus improving the 
production efficiency.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method of
wrapping a bundle of fiber, and more particularly relates
to a method of wrapping a bundle of hollow fiber so as to
subsequently fill a tube with the bundle, wherein the
hollow fiber is such as widely used in the field of blood
treatment, reverse osmosis, heat exchange or the like.Usually, fiber bundles have been cut into
predetermined lengths to be accommodated in tubes or
cylindrical containers. For protection of the bundles
from damage during the cutting and insertion processes,
each bundle has been wrapped with a protective sheet
before cut into the lengths.
Such a method is described in US-A-4 276 687.Fig. 3 shows a fiber bundle
21 enclosed with a sheet 22, and Fig. 4 is a cross section
thereof. The protective sheet 22 is tightened and a
longitudinal edge thereof is anchored to a body portion of
the sheet at several portions by some lengths of a one-side
adhesive tape 23.When winding the sheet 22 on the fiber bundle 21,
some hollow fibers 24 included in an outer layer thereof
tend to be jammed in the piled portions of the sheet. The
jammed fibers 24 are likely to be damaged, bent and/or
broken not only during the wrapping step but also while
inserting the bundle 21 together with the sheet 22 into
the container. In use of a hollow fiber apparatus, the
damaged hollow fibers 24 in the bundle have caused certain
serious problems such as a leakage of blood flowing
through the fibers.Therefore, the wrapping of hollow fiber bundle 21
with the sheet 22 have had to be carried out carefully to
avoid the jamming of fibers 24. If such a jamming is
found in an already wrapped bundle 21, it must be repaired
manually. The repairing work has thus rendered production
efficiency low.A few pieces of the one-side adhesive tape 23
fastening the sheet edge have not been enough to ensure a 
smooth transportation of the bundles on an assembly line.
This is because some curled edges of the sheet often have
collided or interfered with any objects or parts present
along the line.The bundles 21 simply wrapped with the sheets 22
have not been of an invariable shape but of a somewhat
depressed shape in cross section. Thus, it has not been
easy to set those bundles in coaxial alignment with the
containers in hollow fiber apparatuses. A further method for wrapping a fiber bundle so as to insert the
bundle into a cylindrical case is described in US-A-5 064 496.
The bundle is wrapped there with an endless belt taking a
cylindrical form by overlapping of the longitudinal belt edges.

<CLAIMS>
A method of wrapping a bundle of fiber
comprising the steps of:


applying a predetermined tension to the bundle [1]
longitudinally thereof and at opposite ends of the

bundle;
then wrapping a tape [3] helically around the bundle [1]

and from one of the opposite ends towards the other end so
that the tape covers the bundle almost entirely, while

maintaining the tension applied thereto; and
finally unwinding the tape [3] off the bundle [1]
 so as
to expose the bundle gradually from the other end towards

the one end, while inserting the thus exposed portion of
the bundle gradually into a cylindrical protector [2]
.
The method of Claim 1, wherein the winding and
unwinding of the tape [3]
 is carried out by a taping unit [5]
which comprises a rotary and annular head [11]
 reciprocating
along and surrounding the bundle [1]
, a reel [12] for feeding the

tape [3] to the bundle [1]
 and taking up the tape therefrom, and a
torque motor [13]
 connecting the reel [12] to the annular head [11]
 and
adjusting the tension of the tape [3]
 which is being wound or
unwound.
