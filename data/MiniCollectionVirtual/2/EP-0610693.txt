<ABSTRACT>
There is proposed a screwdriver bit (1) which has at its one end a driven region (3) capable of being brought into engagement with a screw, at its opposite end a driving region (5) capable of being assigned to a driving device of a machine tool, and an intermediate region arranged between these ends and comprising a torsional zone. The screwdriver bit (1) is distinguished in that the intermediate region from the driven region (3) as far as the driving region (5) is designed as a torsion region (11), and in that the profile of the torsion region changes preferably continuously, virtually over its entire length.

<CLAIMS>
A screwdriver bit, which is provided at one of its ends with a driven region (3) which can 
be brought into engagement with a screw, and at its opposite end with a driving region 

(5) which can be associated with a drive device, and with an intermediate region situated 
between the ends and comprising a twistable zone (11), 
characterized in that
 the intermediate 
region is formed as a torsion region (11) from the driven region (3) as far as the 

driving region (5), and the profile of the torsion region changes practically over its entire 
length (
B
). 
A screwdriver bit according to Claim 1, 
characterized in that
 starting from the driven 
region (3) the maximum diameter of the profile of the torsion region (11) increases up to 

an apex (15) and from there decreases in the direction of the driving region (5). 
A screwdriver bit according to Claim 1 or 2, 
characterized in that
 the profile of the torsion 
region (11) changes in a continuous manner. 
A screwdriver bit according to one of the preceding Claims, 
characterized in that
 the 
cross-sectional shape of the torsion region (11) deviates from the circular shape to an 

increasing extent as the maximum diameter of the profile becomes greater. 
A screwdriver bit according to one of the preceding Claims, 
characterized in that
 the 
cross-sectional area of the torsion region (11) remains substantially constant over its 

length. 
A screwdriver bit according to one of the preceding Claims, 
characterized in that
 at 
least the torsion region (11) is produced by cold forming. 
A screwdriver bit according to one of the preceding Claims, 
characterized in that
 the 
cross-sectional shape of the torsion region (11) corresponds at least at its end facing the 

driven region (3) to the cross-sectional shape of the driven region. 
A screwdriver bit according to one of the preceding Claims, 
characterized in that
 the 
driven region (3) is provided with a profiling comprising ribs (13) arranged in a cruciform 

manner for engagement in Phillips-head screws.  
 
A screwdriver bit according to Claim 8, 
characterized in that
 the width and height of 
the ribs (13) change - preferably in a continuous manner - over the length of th
e torsion 
region (11). 
A screwdriver bit according to Claim 8 or 9, 
characterized in that
 the ribs (13) are 
separated from one another by grooves (17), the depth and width of which change over 

the length of the torsion region (11). 
A screwdriver bit according to one of the preceding Claims, 
characterized in that
 the 
ratio of the length of the driven region (3) to the length of the portion in which the maximum 

diameter of the profiled portion of the torsion region (11) is reduced is in the range 
of from approximately 0·36 to approximately 0·8.
