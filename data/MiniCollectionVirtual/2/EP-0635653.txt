<ABSTRACT>
A device for transmitting/absorbing a rotational torque is provided with a rotating input element (2), an output element (1) and an electrorheological friction device between the input element (2) and the output element (1), the electrorheological fluid being accommodated in a space (6) which is bounded by a rotating clutch member (4) connected to the input element and by a second clutch member (5) connected to the output element. The torque transmitted to the second clutch member (5) can be converted into a translational movement of an operating member (10) by means of a torque conversion device (9) interacting with the second clutch member (5).

<CLAIMS>
Device for actuating a clutch with a rotating input
element (2, 3), an output element (8) and an

electrorheological friction device between the input element
(2, 3) and the output element (8), the electrorheological

fluid being accommodated in a chamber (6), which is defined
by a first clutch member (4) connected to the input element

(2, 3) and a second clutch member (5) connected to the
output element (8), characterised in that the output element

(8) is connected via a torque converter device (9) to a
release element (10) for actuating a clutch of a motor

vehicle.
Device according to claim 1, characterised in that a
clutch spring (11) transfers the release element (10)

against the drag moment of the electrorheological friction
device into a basic position.
Device according to claims 1 and 2, characterised in
that the output element (8) is connected via a spindle

device as torque converter device (9) to the release element
(10) of the clutch.
Device according to claim 1, characterised in that, in
order to control the switching or adjusting force, the

electrical field between the two clutch members (4, 5) is
variable.
