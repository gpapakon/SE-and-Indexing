<ABSTRACT>
A position detector includes a magnetic recording 
medium on which a prescribed magnetic pattern has been 

formed, a magnetoresistive element the amplitude value 
of which varies in response to the magnetic pattern, an 

amplifier for amplifying the output of the 
magnetoresistive element, the offset voltage of the 

amplifier output being variable, and output observing 
element for observing the output of the amplifier. The 

offset voltage of the amplifier is set based upon the 
results of observation provided by the output observing 

element. Adjustment of the offset voltage is thus set 
automatically.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a position detector as defined in the preamble clause of claim 1 and known from DE-A-4029828.More particularly, this invention relates to a position detector which, by
means of linear encoder composed of a scale portion on
which a magnetic pattern has been recorded and a
detector portion (magnetic head) comprising a
magnetoresistive element that is moved along the scale
portion to detect the magnetic pattern, is for detecting
the position of, say, a carriage (e.g., a carriage
carrying the printing head of a serial printer) on which
the magnetic head is mounted. Since the position
detector of the present invention preferably is applied
to detection of carriage position, as set forth above,
the invention is described in relation to improvements
in a carriage position detector used heretofore. It
should be noted, however, that the invention is not
limited to such application.Fig. 6 illustrates a prior-art example of a device
for detecting the position of a carriage in a serial
printer. The position detector includes MR elements
(magnetoresistive elements) 11, 12 for reading a 
magnetic pattern formed on a magnetic recording medium
(not shown). The arrangement is such that a constant
current is supplied to these elements by operational
amplifiers 103, 104 and transistors 105, 106. A
differential amplifier 107 amplifies the difference
between the outputs of the MR elements 11, 12 at a
prescribed amplification factor. Since the outputs of
the MR elements are 180Â° out of phase, the result of
amplification by the differential amplifier 107 is a
pseudo-sinusoidal signal output that resembles a sine
wave. An inverting amplifier 108 amplifies the output
of the differential amplifier 107 to a prescribed
magnitude.The + input terminals of the amplifiers 107 and 108
are biased to prescribed values by resistors R1, R2 of
identical resistance and a variable resistor VR1,
respectively.The magnitude of the offset voltage of the output
from the inverting amplifier 108 preferably is one-half
the power-supply voltage, i.e.,  1 / 2Vdd, in order that the
maximum amplitude voltage of the inverting amplifier 108
may be utilized effectively, i.e., in order that the
dynamic range will not be reduced. However, owing to a
variance in the difference between the resistance values
of the MR elements 11, 12 and in the input offset
voltages possessed by the operational amplifying 
elements used in the differential amplifier 107 and
inverting amplifier 108, the offset voltage of the
inverting amplifier 108
