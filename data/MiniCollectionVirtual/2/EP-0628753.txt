<DESCRIPTION>
The invention generally relates to a rotary valve for 
automatic transmission, comprising a spool rotatably received 
within a valve housing and adapted to be rotatively driven by 
an actuator, so that a hydraulic pressure from a hydraulic 
pressure source is selectively supplied to each of a plurality 
of frictionally engaging elements through the spool, according 
to the preamble of claims 1 and 2. There are such conventionally known rotary valves 
automatic transmissions as described, for example, in 
the generic JP-A 63-312577. Such prior art conventional rotary valve for the automatic 
transmission suffers from a problem that line pressure supplied 
from the hydraulic pressure source through an input port formed 
in the valve housing is applied to an outer side surface of the 
spool from a radial direction and, for this reason, an opposite 
outer side surface of the spool is urged against an inner 
peripheral surface of a valve bore of the valve housing and, as 
a result, smooth rotation of the spool is prevented. To avoid such disadvantage, it can be conceived that a 
circumferential groove, to which the line pressure is 
transmitted, is formed in an outer peripheral surface to 
eliminate side force. However, the provision of such 
circumferential groove results not only in an increased 
fabrication cost for the spool, but also in a problem of 
sealing between an oil passage opened into the peripheral  
 
surface of the spool and the circumferential groove. Therefore, 
it is necessary to prolong the axial size of the spool to 
insure a sealing length, and to reduce the clearance between 
the spool and the valve housing to prevent leakage of oil. Such 
a construction, as described above, causes new problems that 
the entire length of the spool is increased, resulting in an 
increase in size of the entire rotary valve, and frictional 
force between the spool and the valve housing is increased. 
Hence, the size of a driving pulse motor must be increased. In the prior art rotary valve, in order to cope with the 
situation where the spool becomes non-rotatable for any reason, 
such as, a malfunction of the pulse motor, for rotatively 
driving the spool and a clogging of the pulse motor with dusts, 
measure is taken, such as means for providing small vibration 
to the spool for preventing any sticking of spool, and a 
provision of an emergency valve. This causes a complication of 
the structure and an increase in cost. In addition, the spool 
of the rotary valve includes a plurality of axial oil
