<ABSTRACT>
A proportional pressure control valve (10) has a metering spool (42) which selectively meters flow between an axial first port (12) and radial second ports (14). The spool (42) is axially reciprocable with a larger face (40) toward the first port (12) and a smaller face (62) opposite from the first port (12), with a pressure equalization bore (60) through the spool (42). A first spring (64) extends between the smaller face (62) of the spool (42) and an armature (66) and the armature (66) is biased to a normal position by a second spring (74) and also has a pressure equalization bore (72) through it. Radial orifices (70) are formed in the end of the armature (66) facing the smaller face (62) of the spool (42), and the end of the armature (66) seats in the main bore (46) in which the spool (42) is seated. Passageways (90) extend from the orifices (70) to the second ports (14), and two selectively and variably energizable electromagnetic coils (80, 82) coaxially encircle the armature (66), one to draw the armature (66) to one side of the normal position and the other to draw the armature (66) to the opposite side. The normal position of the armature (66) preferably biases the spool (42) to an intermediate setting so that energizing the coil (82) which is toward the closed position of the spool (42) stiffens the response of the valve (10) and energizing the coil (80) which is away from the closed position of the spool (42) softens the response of the valve (10). Energizing one or the other coil (80, 82) also varies the exposed area of the orifices (70) to change the slope of the pressure-flow rate curve (98, 99, 100, 101, 102) at the particular energization level for low flow rates.

<DESCRIPTION>
 PROPORTIONAL PRESSURE CONTROL VALVEField Of The InventionThis invention relates to pressure control devices, and particularly to a compact two-stage pressure control valve which is especially useful in vehicle suspension systems.Background Of The InventionHydraulic shock absorbers or suspension dampers are used on vehicles to dampen oscillations caused by uneven road surfaces or vehicle accelerations . Hydraulic dampers absorb vibrational energy using hydraulic principles. Dampers employ a piston within a cylinder, where the damper extends and retracts (compresses; in response to vehicle movements. Fluid is forced through a series of orifices and relief and check valves in order to control the motion of the piston and achieve damping.Unfortunately, however, such dampers are passive in that the orifices and the relief and check valves produce the same damping characteristics for all road surfaces. Dampers should optimally be able to assume different operating characteristics under varying operating conditions. To correct this shortcoming, vehicle suspension systems have incorporated selectable or adaptive control systems. In these systems, the vehicle operator is able to select between firm or soft suspension ride modes. A small direct current motor within the damper opens or closes a valve which operates in parallel with the star.-^3rd orifices and relief valves within the damper. As a re .-.it, the vehicle operator may modify the vehicle ride mode to accommodate personal preference.Adaptive control is limited, however, because the parallel valving must be set in either a fully on or a fully off position. It would be desirable for the control 

 system to be proportionally controlled, so that the characteristics of the damper could change in relation to real-time varying road conditions. It may also be deÂ¬ sirable for the control system to incorporate other factors which may affect the optimal suspension ride mode, such as vehicle speed, load, or the present position of the damper. Additionally, adaptive control systems typically require 0.25 seconds or more for the selected ride mode to take effect. Even if the operator desired to modify the ride mode for a change in road conditions, the selectable system may not be able to respond in time. For example, if the system was set for a soft ride, it may be desired to .. quickly change it to a firm ride, for example to increase the tire-to-road force when going over a series of bumps so as to improve turning ability or to negotiate a turn so as to prevent
