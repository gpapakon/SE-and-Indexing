<ABSTRACT>
A method of precision machining at least one cut into 
an article having a non-uniform surface, wherein the cut is 

of substantially constant depth relative to the non-uniform 
surface. One aspect of the invention is a machined optical wafer 

having two adjacent notches (20,16), to serve as a platform 
for a fiber optic pigtail, machined into the edge of the 

wafer. Another aspect of the invention is a method of 
automatically machining a plurality of notches into an 

optical wafer. 
For optical wafers having embedded light paths, light 
detected from these light paths may be used to compensate 

for the variation in embedded depth of the light paths.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to
a method of precision machining an
article. More specifically, the invention relates to
method of
precision machining an optical wafer.Due in large part to an increasing demand for very
accurately machined parts, precise, automated machining
has become a wide and diverse field of endeavor. The
relationship between dimensional tolerance of machined
parts and the life expectancy and performance of those
parts was recongnized early in the development of the
art. Parts machined to tight tolerances generally offered
better performance and were found to last longer. To meet
the demand for precision parts, a machining art based
upon sensors coupled to automatic machine controllers has
developed.A first example of such automated machining is found
in "IBM Technical Disclosure Bulletin", V. 33, #1A, pages
194-5. Disclosed there is a machine tool having a sensor
which locates the tool position along a line. The sensor 
sends a signal to a drive mechanism which drives the tool
toward or away from the workpiece. Although the
disclosure does not refer to a method for relating the
position of the tool relative to the surface of a
workpiece, it may be assumed that one of the methods
described immediately below is used. In any case, the
publication does not disclose a machined article made
using a method which located the workpiece surface
relative to a single tool position.In U.S. 4,954,022, Underwood et al., a workpiece of
known shape is positioned on a moveable table beneath a
movable tool. See col.1, 11.45-65. The tool is moved into
electrical contact with the workpiece and the spatial
location of the contact point relative to a reference
position is recorded. The tool then bores a hole of
preset depth into the workpiece. See col.2. 11.39-45. A
computer compares the recorded point of contact to the
expected point of contact. The expected point of 
contact is based upon the known shape of the workpiece and
its known initial position on the table. The tool
retracts, moves to a second point on the workpiece and
makes electrical contact with the workpiece. The
difference between expected point of contact is compared to
the actual point of contact at each position where a hole
is to be bored to insure uniform depth of the holes,
"...the exact positions of the workpiece with respect to
the expected positions of the workpiece are displayed to
insure that each subsequent cut was made to the same
uniform depth as the previous cuts in the workpiece." (Col.
2, 11. 21-25.) The ideal end product

<CLAIMS>
A method for machining a surface (4,10) of an article,
wherein the depth of cut into said surface has a

preselected value relative to said surface, and wherein
at least a portion of said surface is non-uniform,

comprising the steps of :

a) fixedly positioning said article relative to a single
reference position of a cutting tool (2), said reference

position being located above said surface,
b) moving said cutting tool (2) to make contact with said
surface at a point having coordinates measured from

the reference position,
c) detecting contact,
d) recording the coordinates of the contact point,
e) retracting said tool (2) from contact with said
surface (4,10),
f) moving said tool (2) to a new location above said
surface (4,10),
g) repeating steps b) through f) at multiple positions on
said surface,
h) fitting a curve to the contact point coordinates found
in steps b) through (g), and
i) machining a cut into said surface (4,10) along said
fitted curve at a preselected depth from said fitted

curve, wherein said machining is controlled by control
means (11) which uses the fitted curve data and the

preselected depth (30) of said cut.
The method of claim 1, characterized in that said
multiple positions lie along a line on said surface

(4,10).
The method of claim 1, characterized in that the
position of said contact relative to said reference

position is stored in said control means. 
The method of claim 1, wherein said cut is a notch
(20,16) further characterized by entering into said

control means (11) a target depth for said at least one
notch, said target depth being measured relative to said

surface.
The method of claim 1, characterized in that said
detecting step comprises means (8) for sensing

ultrasound.
The method of claim 5, characterized in that said
ultrasound sensing means (8) is attached to means (12)

for fixedly positioning said machined article.
The method of claim 1, said recording step further
characterized by fitting a curve (Fig. 4) to said

recorded positions through use of computing means.
The method of claim 7, characterized in that said
article is an optical wafer having embedded light paths,

said method being further characterized by ,

moving a detector to detect light from said light
paths,
recording said detector position relative to said
reference position of said cutting tool.
The method of claim 1, characterized in that the depth
of cut is controlled to a different target at different

points along the length of the cut.
