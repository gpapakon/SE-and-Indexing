<ABSTRACT>
A method and apparatus for use in formation testing instrument (13) for acquisition of a phase intact sample of connate fluid. One or more fluid sample tanks (26, 28) contained within the instrument (13) are pressure balanced with respect to the wellbore at formation level and are filled with a connate fluid sample in such manner that during filling of the sample tanks (26, 28) the pressure of the connate fluid is maintained within the predetermined range above the bubble point of the fluid sample. The sample tank (26, 28) incorporates an internal free-floating piston (46) which separates the sample tank into sample containing and pressure balancing chambers with the pressure balancing chamber being in communication with borehole pressure. The sample tank is provided with a cut-off valve (27, 29) enabling the pressure of the fluid sample to be maintained after the formation testing instrument (13) has been retrieved from the wellbore for transportation to a laboratory facility.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates generally to a method and apparatus for subsurface
formation testing, and more particularly concerns a method and apparatus for taking
samples of connate fluid at formation pressure, retrieving the samples and transporting
them to a laboratory for analysis while maintaining formation pressure. Even more
specifically, the present invention concerns sample vessels that are utilized in
conjunction with in situ multi-testing of subsurface earth formation wherein the sample
vessels are removably assembled with multi-testing instruments and are separable from
such instruments for transportation separately to a suitable site for laboratory analysis
or for on-site analysis.The sampling of fluids contained in subsurface earth formations provides a
method of testing formation zones of possible interest by recovering a sample of any
formation fluids present for later analysis in a laboratory environment while causing
a minimum of damage to the tested formations. The formation sample is essentially
a point test of the possible productivity of subsurface earth formations. Additionally,
a continuous record of the control and sequence of events during the test is made at the
surface. From this record, valuable formation pressure and permeability data as well
as data determinative of fluid compressibility, density and relative viscosity can be
obtained for formation reservoir analysis.Early formation fluid sampling instruments such as the one described in U.S.
Patent No. 2,674,313 were not fully successful as a commercial service because they
were limited to a single test on each trip into the borehole. Later instruments were
suitable for multiple testing; however, the success of these testers depended to some
extent on the characteristics of the particular formations to be tested. For example,
where earth formations were unconsolidated, a different sampling apparatus was
required than in the case of consolidated formations. Down-hole multi-tester instruments have been developed with extensible
sampling probes for engaging the borehole wall at the formation of interest for
withdrawing fluid samples therefrom and measuring pressure. In downhole instruments
of this nature it is typical to provide an internal draw-down piston which is reciprocated
hydraulically or electrically to increase the internal volume of a fluid receiving chamber
within the instrument after engaging the borehole wall. This action reduces the
pressure at the instrument formation interface causing fluid to flow from the
