<ABSTRACT>
Methods for inactivating contaminating amplicons in isothermal nucleic acid amplification 
reactions such as SDA, Qβ and 3SR. dU is incorporated into the amplicons produced by 

amplification in the place of thymine (T). If these amplicons contaminate a subsequent 
amplification reaction, they may be inactivated as templates (i.e., rendered unamplifiable) by 

treatment with UDG. As isothermal amplification does not involve elevated temperatures, the 
UDG may be inactivated during the subsequent amplification of specific target sequences by 

inclusion of the UDG inhibitor protein Ugi. Incorporation of dU has unexpectedly been found to 
enhance the amplification power of SDA as compared to conventional SDA reactions. The 

methods may also be used to detect UDG activity in reagents or samples.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to nucleic acid amplification and in particular to inactivation 
of amplicons from a previous amplification reaction which may contaminate a subsequent 
amplification reaction. Nucleic acid amplification reactions are processes by which specific nucleic acid sequences 
are amplified. They have become powerful tools in nucleic acid analysis and preparation. Several 
nucleic acid amplification methods are known. These include the polymerase chain reaction 
(PCR), self-sustained sequence replication (3SR), the ligase chain reaction (LCR), Qβ replicase 
amplification and strand displacement amplification (SDA). Unfortunately, the powerful ability of 
these nucleic acid amplification methods to amplify minute quantities of a target sequence also 
make them susceptible to contamination by target sequences (amplicons) which may be carried 
over from previous amplification reactions in reagents, pipetting devices and laboratory surfaces. 
These contaminating products of previous amplifications may themselves be amplified in a 
subsequent amplification reaction. Even a few molecules of a contaminating target sequence may 
be readily amplified and detected, resulting in falsely positive results. A recently developed method for inactivating contaminating amplicons in PCR involves 
incorporation of the nucleotide deoxyuridine triphosphate (dUTP) into amplified nucleic acid 
sequences in place of thymidine triphosphate (TTP). As deoxyuridine (dU) is not normally found 
in naturally-occurring DNA, this nucleotide serves to distinguish previously produced amplicons 
from new target sequences which have not yet been amplified. The uracil-containing DNAs, 
representing previously amplified contaminating sequences, are then treated with the enzyme 
uracil DNA glycosylase (UDG; also known as uracil N-glycosylase or UNG). In nature, uracil  
 
DNA glycosylase excises uracil bases from DNA which can arise as a result of either 
misincorporation by DNA polymerase or deamination of cytosine. For decontamination of PCR 
amplifications, UDG removes the intentionally incorporated uracil in amplified nucleic acid. 
Uracil is removed without destruction of the sugar-phosphodiester backbone, thereby producing 
an abasic site in the DNA. These abasic sites are susceptible to hydrolysis by heat or alkali, a 
process which fragments the uracil-containing DNA and renders it unamplifiable in subsequent 
PCR. As employed to decontaminate PCR, a sample is treated with UDG prior to PCR 
amplification and the
