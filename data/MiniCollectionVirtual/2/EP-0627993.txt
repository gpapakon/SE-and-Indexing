<ABSTRACT>
A process is disclosed for producing an elastic, multilayer material web made of a flexible, elastic carrier foil made of a thermoplastic elastomer and of corrugated nonwoven webs secured to the top and lower side of the carrier foil and soldered to each other. The solders are designed as spot-welding surfaces distributed in a grid over the material web and form at the same time areas of increased air permeability through the material web. The process comprises the following steps: (a) feeding and stretching the carrier foil up to at least (100 + a) % of the non-stretched length, (100 % standing for the non-stretched web); (b) separately feeding and stretching two nonwoven webs (11; 12) up to (100 + b) % and (100 + c) %, while respecting the following inequality: b 
<
 c 
<
 a, whereas the difference between the extent of stretching of the webs is large enough to corrugate the nonwoven webs, and joining the webs into a sandwich structure constituted of the central carrier foil and of the outer nonwoven webs; (c) soldering the nonwoven webs to the carrier foil by means of a cylinder carrying soldering points which is a part of a soldering station; (d) relaxing the carrier foil, to which the nonwoven webs are soldered, after it leaves the soldering station.

Process for producing an elastic, multilayer
material web (21), which comprises a flexible, elastic

carrier film (13) of a thermoplastic elastomer and
nonwoven webs (11; 12) secured in a corrugated form

respectively on the upper side and underside of the
carrier film (13), said nonwoven webs being welded to

each other and the weld connections (22) being
distributed over the material web (21) and at the same

time areas of increased air permeability through the
material web (21) being provided, having the following

process steps:

a) feeding and stretching the carrier film (13) up to
at least (100 + a) % of the unstretched length,
b) separately feeding two nonwoven webs (11; 12) and
bringing them together to form a sandwich arrangement

which comprises the carrier film (13) in the
middle and the nonwoven webs (11; 12) on the

outside,
c) welding the nonwoven webs (11; 12) to the carrier
film (13) with the aid of a cylinder (15) bearing

welding pins (25) as part of a welding station
(10),
d) relaxing the carrier film (13) with the welded-on
non-woven webs (11; 12) after it leaves the welding

station (10),

characterized by feeding and stretching the two nonwoven
webs (11; 12) to extents of (100 + b) % and (100 + c) %,

respectively, while maintaining the following
inequality:


b 
<
 c 
<
 a

great enough to produce a corrugated lie of the nonwoven

web [sic] (11; 12), and subsequently carrying out steps

c) and d), spot-welding surfaces (22) arranged in the
manner of a grid being formed in step c).
Process according to claim 1, characterized in
that the stretching b = 0, i.e. the first nonwoven web

substance of the nonwoven films (11; 12).
Process according to one of the preceding
claims, characterized in that the ratio of the sum of

the welding surfaces (22) to the stretched surface area
