<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a photo-electric
converter such as an image sensor used in
an image information processing apparatus such as a
copying apparatus, facsimile apparatus or a video
camera, or an AE/AF sensor of an automatic exposure
and/or automatic focusing device of a camera.As electronic technology has advanced
recently, high performance of products such as
cameras, copying machines and facsimile machines have
been attempted.For example, in a single reflex type camera,
almost all products are presently equipped with the
automatic exposure (AE) function and the automatic
focusing (AF) function.In the AE function, an absolute light
intensity of the entire area in one frame corresponding
to an image pickup area, or a sub-area of a
frame area, is measured to automatically control
the exposure or the shutter speed. On the other hand,
in the AF function, the distance to an object is
calculated using a correlation function of an object
pattern, to automatically control a lens position. Thus, in order to enhance precision, it is
necessary to further subdivide the image pickup area.Because the image pickup areas and the post-processing
are different between the AE and the AF,
it is necessary to use separate photo-electric
converters (sensors). While various improvements have
been made in the individual products to reduce the
cost, a significant effect has not been attained.In a known photometry sensor used for the AE
function, when the light intensity of an entire area is
to be detected, signals of respective areas are
amplified by logarithmic amplifiers and output signals
thereof are multiplexed.In a known distance measurement sensor used for the
AF function, emitters of phototransistors for the
respective photo-sensing areas are connected in common
and a peak signal is measured. With this method it is difficult
to measure an absolute light intensity of the entire
photo-sensing area and it is not used for the AE
function.By way of example, a typical example of the
former is described in detail in US-A- 5,115,124 and a
typical example of the latter is described in detail
in US-A- 4,751,559.In the former method, the signal processing in
the succeeding stage and the drive of the decoder to
multiplex the signals are complex, and the latter 
method is not suitable for the AE function.US-A-4908709 proposes a solid state electronic
imaging device having a plurality of columns of
photodiodes together with a vertical CCD for each column
of photodiodes. In order to read out an image signal,
charges from
