<ABSTRACT>
An implantable cardioverter/defibrillator and method for 
its use are disclosed. A sensing electrode (14, 16) provides 

an ECG signal to the defibrillator, this signal is amplified 
(12, 26) and evaluated for the presence of a tachyarrhythmia. 

The phase of the ECG signal is sensed during a detected fibrillation 
or tachycardia and this determines the phase of the 

stimulating output signals. The ECG may be continously sensed 
during the application of the defibrillating output and each 

output is held constant until a threshold crossing of the ECG 
is detected, whereupon the defibrillating output is changed

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a medical device for
electrically stimulating a patient's heart, comprising means
for sensing the ECG from said patient's heart, and means for
generating at least one electrical defibrillating output signal
for delivery to said patient's heart.Such a medical device is known e.g. from US-A-4,967,747. The present invention relates generally to devices for
controlling cardiac arrhythmias, and more specifically to an implantable
defibrillator for delivering defibrillating electrical signals to a
patient's heart.A number of different systems and methods have been
developed for delivering electrical shocks to a patient's heart for the
treatment of detected abnormal heart rhythms (arrhythmias). These
methods deliver specific waveform shapes or pulse sequences to the
heart in order to treat the detected arrhythmia by depolarizing the heart
tissue cells. One early waveform is disclosed in U.S. Patent No.
3,706,313 to Milani et al., which provides a circuit for delivering a
"trapezoidal" wave shape for defibrillating the heart by truncating the
output of an exponentially decaying capacitor. Others have suggested
the use of sequential pulses delivered through multiple pathways such as
is described in U.S. Patent No. 4,708,145 to Tacker, Jr. In Tacker, Jr., a
series of rectangular or truncated exponential pulses are delivered to the
heart using at least three electrodes. A first pulse is sent through a first
pair of the three electrodes and then a second pulse is sent through a
second, different pair of the electrodes. Still others have described the
use of multiphasic waveforms, such as U.S. Patent No. 4,637,397 to
Jones et al., which describes a triphasic waveform. A triphasic
waveform has three pulses of alternating positive and negative polarity.
U.S. Patent No. 3,924,641 to Weiss and U.S. Patent No. 4,850,357 to
Bach, Jr. describe the use of biphasic waveforms.Defibrillation pulses of the type described above are typically in the
range of from about 500 to 1000 volts delivered for a time of from about
2 to 12 milliseconds. Overall energy delivery to the heart for a 
defibrillation waveform may typically be from about 10 to 40 joules. A
monophasic defibrillation waveform may typically be a truncated
exponential decay with an initial voltage of about 700 volts and a
duration of about 10 milliseconds. A biphasic defibrillation waveform
may typically have an initial positive pulse of about 750 volts for a
duration of 6 milliseconds and a negative pulse of about 100 to 400 volts
