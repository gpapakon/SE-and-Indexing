Artificial nose (1) for a tracheotomy subject with a 
surgical orifice (3) joining the trachea to the skin (2), 

having, in a perforated housing (20) held on the periphery of 
the surgical orifice (3) by an annular base (10) adhering to 

the skin, a hydrophilic filtering mass (40) forming an 
alternating-circulation heat and moisture exchanger between 

the exhaled air and the inhaled air, a grid (30) being 
disposed between the filtering mass (40) and the surgical 

orifice (3), characterised in that, the grid (30) being 
disposed in the housing with front (32) and rear (31) surfaces 

which are distant in their active central part and facing 
respectively towards the filtering mass (40) and the surgical 

orifice (3), the rear surface (31) has calibrated passages, 
and is spaced apart from the front surface (32) by a distance 

such, conjointly with the calibre of the passages, that mucus 
expelled from the trachea is not, for the main part, able to 

reach the filtering mass (40). 
Artificial nose according to Claim 1, characterised in 
that the filtering mass (40) is produced from polyuretha
ne 
foam with open pores. 
Artificial nose according to one of Claims 1 and 2, 
characterised in that the base (10) has a flexible collar (11) 

surrounding a front annular rim (12) on which a complementary 
recess (21) in the housing (20) engages. 
Artificial nose according to Claim 3, characterised in 
that the annular rim (12) has a peripheral ring (13) which 

engages in a groove (22) formed in the recess in the housing 
(20). 
Artificial nose according to one of Claims 3 and 4,  
 

characterised in that the base (10) also has a rear sleeve 
(14) in line with the annular rim (12) and suitable for 

engaging in the surgical orifice. 
Artificial nose according to any one of Claims 1 to 5, 
characterised in that the base (10) is provided with a double-sided 

adhesive (15), suitable for being applied to the skin 
(2). 
Artificial nose according to any one of Claims 1 to 6, 
characterised in that the front surface (32) of the grid (30) 

is plane, whilst its rear surface (31) is curved in a dome 
shape, and consists of a grid with a square mesh. 
Artificial nose according to any one of Claims 1 to 7, 
characterised in that the housing (20) is annular in shape 

with a lattice front end. 
Artificial nose according to claim 8, characterised in 
that the housing (20) has a cap (50, 60, 70) covering the 

front end (52, 64) parallel to and at a distance from the 
latter, with lateral openings. 
Artificial nose according to Claim 9, characterised in 
that the cap (50) has a front plate (52) held by struts (53) 

at a distance from an annulus (51), which slides with friction 
on the periphery of the housing (20), with sufficient travel 

for the front plate (52) to be able to came to close off the 
front end of the housing (20). 
Artificial nose according to Claim 9, characterised in 
that the cap (60) has a lateral edge (63) which extends as far 

as the front end (64) over one semi-circumference whilst the 
other semi-circumference emerges in an orientable flat skirt 

(62). 
Artificial nose according to Claim 8, characterised in  
 

that it also includes, fitting on top of the housing (20) 
around the front end, a chamber with valves (72), with an 

inspiration valve (74) between the chamber and a pipe (73) 
suitable for being pressed against the thorax of the subject 

so as to be substantially at the same temperature as the body, 
and an expiration valve (75) opening out directly to the 

outside.
