said plate (7), driven rotationally around said vertical axis
(8) and provided with a central passage (25) for the wires,

translationally along an axis identical to the axis of

rotation (8) of the head, said support carrying said
winding/contact laying down small wheel (9) and said means (48

to 55) of driving and cutting the wires as well as sets (39,
40) of wire-guidance and non-return pulleys,

passage (25) of said rotary component (23).
Machine according to one of Claims 1 to 3, characterised
in that, with each wire (F) of each winding/contact laying down

head (T1 to T4), a drive device is associated comprising a
roller (48) mounted on a free wheel (49) driven at the same

time as the winding/contact laying down small wheel (9) but
with a peripheral speed slightly lower than that of said small

wheel and a presser roller (51) provided with means (52) of
application or not onto said roller (48) and a wire non-return

device composed of a pulley (39a, 39b, 39c; 40a, 40b, 40c)
