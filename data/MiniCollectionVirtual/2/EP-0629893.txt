<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a liquid
crystal device, in particular, a ferroelectric liquid
crystal device, used in a liquid crystal display
device or a liquid crystal optical shutter. More
particularly, the present invention is concerned with
a liquid crystal device having achieved an improvement
of display characteristics because of an improvement
of the state of liquid crystal molecular alignment.Clark and Lagerwall have proposed a display
device of the type in which the refractive index
anisotropy of ferroelectric liquid crystal molecules
is utilized and transmitted light rays are controlled
by its combination with a polarizer (see Japanese
Patent Laid-Open Gazette No. 56-107216 and U.S.
Patent No. 4,367,924). This ferroelectric liquid
crystal commonly has a chiral smectic C phase (Sm*C)
or H phase (Sm*H) of non-spiral structure in a
specific temperature range, and, under such a state,
has the properties of assuming either a first
optically stable state or a second optically stable
state in response to an electric field applied and 
also maintaining that state when no electric field is
applied, in other words, the bistable state (or two
stable states). This ferroelectric liquid crystal
also has a quick response to changes in electric
fields, and is expected to be widely utilized as a
display device of a high-speed and memory type. In
particular, in view of its function, it is expected to
be applicable as a display device with a large screen
and high detail.In order for an optical modulation device
applying such a bistable liquid crystal to exhibit
desired drive characteristics, a liquid crystal
disposed between a pair of parallel substrates is
required to be in the state of molecular orientation
that the conversion between the above two stable
states may effectively take place, independently of an
applied state of electric field.In the case of a liquid crystal device in
which the double refraction of a liquid crystal is
utilized, the transmittance under crossed nicols is
expressed by:
I/I0 = Sin2 4 sin2Δndλ π
wherein
I0:incident light intensity,I:transmitted light intensity, :tilt angleΔn:refractive index anisotropyd:film thickness of a liquid crystal layer,λ:wavelength of incident light.
Thus, the tilt angle  in the above non-spiral
structure is present as an angle in the direction of
an average molecular axis of a liquid crystal molecule
twistingly oriented in the first and second states of
alignment. According to the above expression, the
transmittance reaches a maximum when the tilt angle
