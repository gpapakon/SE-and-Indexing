<ABSTRACT>
The present invention minimizes the effects 
of capillary and inertial forces on the film profile 

for a slide hopper, thereby making the film profile 
smooth and predictable even when the transition section 

is short. The invention enables improved coating 
uniformity over the main width of the coating and 

particularly at the edges.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention concerns a curtain 
coating method and apparatus which produces improved 
uniformity in the coated product. Curtain coating is a very efficient method of 
manufacturing precision coatings of multiple layers. 
There are a number of patents that describe the method, 
such as U.S. 3,508,947. In the curtain coating 
process, particularly when multiple layers are 
involved, it is critical that the thickness of each 
layer remain uniform over the width of the web. There 
are several problems that can cause layer 
nonuniformities before the liquid layers meet the web. 
For example, problems can occur at the inlets and 
outlets of the liquid layers flowing over the slide. 
Here, the liquid layers emerge from the slots onto the 
slide and the film thickness becomes variable in the 
direction transverse to the average flow. Another 
problem area is the precise shape of the lip from which 
the liquid film plunges into free fall as a curtain. 
Here, a contact line between the slide (solid), the 
liquid and the air (gas) is formed and the shape of the 
lip is a critical part in ensuring that the contact 
line is always straight. An example of a patent which 
describes these problems is U.S. 4,109,611. Another problem area is found along each of 
the two sides of the hopper's slide, where the liquid's 
free surface meets a solid surface. These solid 
surfaces at the edge of the coating liquid layers must 
be carefully designed so that the free surface i.e.,  
 
the upper interface of the top layer, remains 
approximately flat right up to the solid edge. This is 
described in U.S. 3,289,632. One approach to achieve 
this result is to design the solid surface as an edge 
pad with its height substantially the same as the 
liquid film thickness. The free surface is then pinned 
to the corner of the edge pad and maintains a 
substantially flat free surface over the width of the 
slide. The same approach can be used on a vertical 
flat section which ends at the lip where the coating 
liquids plunge into free fall. A related issue is that 
edge pads produce better results if they are 
continuous. Further information on apparatus for 
continuous edging can be found in International 
Application PCT/US92/08497 (WO-A-93/18470). Discontinuities in the 
height of the edge pads introduce flow disturbances 
that can produce layer thickness non-uniformities. It 
is inferred from this that besides being of 
substantially the same height as the liquid film, it is 
best that any difference in height between the
