<ABSTRACT>
A device for the automatic optical evaluation of colorimetric coloration zones is to be made capable of evaluating not only a single test tube, but also a plurality of reaction zones applied successively on a common base. Also to be achieved in this case are the smallest quantities of indicator substances for the coloration zone and a sufficient signal intensity at the smallest possible power demand for the optical signal evaluation, the fault sensitivity being simultaneously reduced. Such a device is characterised by having both the transmitting and the receiving unit (19, 20, 22) mounted on a common mounting base (18), the light from the transmitter unit (19, 20) being guided via waveguides (25, 27) through the transilluminating region of the reagent support (1), and detecting, in transmission or reflection, the coloration of the reaction zones (5) applied in the form of a channel to the support (1).
