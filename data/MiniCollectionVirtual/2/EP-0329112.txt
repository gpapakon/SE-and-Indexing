<ABSTRACT>
A medical electrical lead having a polyurethane outer 
sheath (22) and one or more coiled metal conductors (32A-32D). 

The metal conductors are optimized for use in conjunction with a 
polyurethane sheath (22) and are provided with a barrier 

coating (34) of a biocompatible metal. The conductors may 
additionally be provided with an outer, insulative coating (38).

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates generally to implantable 
electrical leads, and in particular to electrical 
stimulation leads. In the early days of pacing, a cardiac pacing lead 
was viewed simply as a wire connecting the pacemaker to 
the heart. However, those skilled in the art have come to 
appreciate that a cardiac pacing lead as implanted is part 
of a complicated electrical, mechanical and chemical 
system. In an effort to improve performance, manufacturers of 
pacing leads have selected specific commercially available 
alloys which have particularly advantageous mechanical and 
electrical properties when used in pacing leads. These 
include stainless steels, Elgiloy® alloy, MP35N alloy, and 
DBS/MP. DBS is a drawn-brazed-strand, having a silver 
core surrounded by strands of stainless steel or of MP35N 
alloy. All of these conductors, when coiled, display 
appropriate mechanical and electrical characteristics for 
use in electrical stimulation leads. Although most early pacing leads were fabricated 
using silicone rubber to insulate the conductors, 
manufacturers have become aware of the superior mechanical 
properties of commercially available polyether urethanes. 
These include Pellethane 80A® and Pellethane 55D® 
polyurethanes manufactured by Dow Chemical Company. These 
polyurethanes are less thrombogenic than silicone rubber 
and higher in tensile strength. In addition, they slide 
easily against one another when moistened with body 
fluids. This property facilitates the use of two leads in 
a single vein, which was difficult with the older silicone 
rubber bodied leads. Unfortunately, recent experience has 
suggested that cobalt, chromium and molybdenum, commonly 
used in lead conductors, may accelerate oxidative  
 
degradation of polyurethane used in pacing leads. MP35N, Elgiloy and DBS/MP all 
include cobalt, molybdenum and chromium as significant constituents. To a lesser degree, 
it appears that stainless steels may also accelerate polyurethane degradation. An additional set of improvements in implantable electrical leads has been the trend toward 
fabrication of multiconductor coils, rather than separate, mutually insulated coils. 
Early leads, such as those disclosed in U.S. Patent No. 3,348,548 and U.S. Patent No. 
3,788,329 show separate conductor coils in a side by side or coaxial configuration, insulated 
from one another by sheaths covering the entirety of the coils. More recently, multipolar 
coiled conductors having individually insulated coil wires have been pursued, as 
disclosed in
