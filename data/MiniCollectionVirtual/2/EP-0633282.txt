<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a novel polyimide 
excellent in solubility and low dielectric properties, 
and the polyimide is utilized in various protective 
films for semiconductors, insulating films between 
layers, orientated films for liquid crystal elements, 
base films for flexible printed wiring boards, gas-permeable 
films, other various insulating films, resins 
for electronic parts, resins for structural materials, 
heat-resistant adhesions and the like. Polyimides are often used in electric and 
electronic fields utilizing their high heat resistance 
and excellent characteristics in respect of mechanical 
strength and electrical insulating properties. However, 
conventional aromatic polyimides have high melting 
points and are insoluble in solvents, and hence, it was 
difficult to mold the aromatic polyimides into a film or 
the like. For example, an aromatic polyimide obtained 
by condensation of 4,4-diaminodiphenyl ether with 
pyromellitic dianhydride (Kapton, a trade name of DU 
PONT in U.S.A.) has a melting point of 500°C or higher 
and is low in solubility, and hence, is usually formed 
into a film by such a method that a polar solvent solution 
of a polyamic acid which is its precursor is cast 
into a film and the film is then heated at a temperature  
 
of 300°C or higher to complete imidization. Thus, conventional aromatic polyimides are 
required to be heat-treated at a high temperature of 
300°C or higher in order to form them into a film or the 
like, and have had such a problem that electron elements, 
substrates, metal wirings and the like undergo 
heat deterioration at such high temperatures to cause a 
reduction of reliability. Also, there has been a 
problem that since films formed at such high temperatures 
shrink after the formation, stress and strain 
remain in the films, whereby the films are curled. 
Therefore, development of an aromatic polyimide which 
can be formed into a film or the like directly at a 
relatively low temperature has been desired. Also, recently, 
because of requirement of high speed electrical 
transmission of signals in a computer or the like, it 
has been desired that the polyimide is allowed to have a 
low dielectric constant in addition to the excellent 
insulating properties which conventional polyimides 
have. Under such circumstances, as a polyimide which 
is soluble and has low dielectric properties, for example, 
a fluorine-introduced polyimide has been developed 
(see, for example, Japanese Patent Application Kokai No. 
4-239,037); however, this
