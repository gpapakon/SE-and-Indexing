<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to coatings based on 
PFPE (perfluoropolyethers) having high mechanical properties, 
in particular hardness, combined with high resistance 
to photooxidative degradation and resistance to hydrolysis. These properties are required in all applications as 
top-coat, for instance in the car industry.  
 A fluorinated methacrylic ester having the general formula: 
 
is known from Derwent Abstract of JP-A-63068542. Fluorinated polyacrylates from perfluoropolyethers, in 
particular Galden(R) acrylates, are known (see US Patent 
5,011,979). Experiments carried out from the Applicant have pointed 
out that resins obtained therefrom have such poor resistance 
properties to hydrolysis, as to make them unsuitable to the 
application as top-coat. It has been unexpectedly found that it is possible to 
prepare coatings based on PFPE having the above indicated 
properties by utilizing the PFPE of the invention as hereinafter 
specified. Object of the present invention are perfluoropolyethers 
containing (meth)acrylic groups  
 
obtainable by copolymerization of: 
a) 1 - 50% by weight of a monomer having general 
formula: 
YCF2ORfCFXCH2(OCH2CH2)pOCOCR=CH2 
wherein Y = F, Cl, CF3, C2F5, C3F7, C4F9; and X = F, CF3; 
p is an integer from 1 to 5; Rf represents a radical 
having perfluoropolyetheral structure of average 
molecular weight of from 400 to 3000, formed by 
sequence of oxyfluoroalkylenic units; and R = H, CH3; b) 40 - 90% by weight of one or more monomer(s) of 
formula 
CH2=CR1 - COOA 
wherein R1 = H, CH3, F, Cl; A is an alkyl radical 
having from 1 to 12 carbon atoms or a fluoroalkyl 
radical having from 1 to 10 carbon atoms, or an 
aliphatic or aromatic cyclic group having from 6 to 
8 carbon atoms; and c) 2 - 30% by weight of one or more monomer(s) of 
formula: 
CH2=CR1-CO-W-B 
wherein R1 has the same meaning described above; W = 
O, NH; B = H, (CH2)sB1 with s = 1 - 5, B1 = -COOH, -OH, 
-CH=CH2, NCO, -CO-CH2CO-CH3, -Si(OR2)3 with alkylic R2 
groups having from 1 to 5 carbon atoms; the sum of 
the monomers a), b) and c) being equal to 100.  
 Rf consists of sequences of oxyfluoroalkylenic 
units, such as for instance the units: 
-CF2O-, -CF2CF2O-, -CF2CF2CF2O-, 
 
-CF2CF2CH2O-; 
R=H, CH3.  
The acrylated perfluoropolyethers of formula (I) 
can be obtained by using the method indicated in the US Patent 
5,011,979 which is here wholly incorporated. 
The methods to prepare the precursors are largely known in 
the art, see for instance US Patents 3,513,203; 3,847,978; 
3,810,874.
