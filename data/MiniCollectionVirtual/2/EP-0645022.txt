<ABSTRACT>
A process is disclosed of preparing silver halide emulsions containing tabular grains bounded by [100] major faces comprised of the steps of (1) introducing silver and halide salts into a dispersing medium and (2) maintaining conditions within the dispersing medium that promote the formation of tabular grains bounded by [100]
 major faces. The process is characterized in that of the tabular grains bounded by [100] major faces a portion accounting for 50 percent of total grain projected area selected on the criteria of adjacent major face edge ratios of less than 10 and thicknesses of less than 0.3  mu m internally at their nucleation site contain iodide and at least 50 mole percent chloride, at least the selected portion of the tabular grains being formed ty nucleation in a continuous double jet reaction in the presence of iodide with chloride accounting for at least 50 mole percent of the halide present in the dispersing medium and the pC1 of the dispersing medium being maintained in the range of from 0.5 to 3.5. Following nucleation tabular grain growth is undertaken in a reaction vessel which receives emulsion from the continuous double jet reactor until the tabular grains having a thickness of less than 0.3  mu m exhibit achieve a selected average aspect ratio.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to processes for
preparing radiation sensitive silver halide emulsions.During the 1980's a marked advance took place
in silver halide photography based on the discovery
that a wide range of photographic advantages, such as
improved speed-granularity relationships, increased
covering power both on an absolute basis and as a
function of binder hardening, more rapid developability,
increased thermal stability, increased
separation of native and spectral sensitization
imparted imaging speeds, and improved image sharpness
in both mono- and multi-emulsion layer formats, can be
achieved by employing high and intermediate aspect
ratio tabular grain emulsions.An emulsion is generally understood to be a
"high aspect ratio tabular grain emulsion" when tabular
grains having a thickness of less than 0.3 µm have an
average aspect ratio of greater than 8 and account for
greater than 50 percent of total grain projected area.
The aspect ratio of a tabular grain is the ratio of its
equivalent circular diameter (ECD) to its thickness
(t). The equivalent circular diameter of a grain is
the diameter of a circle having an area equal to the
projected area of the grain. The term "intermediate
aspect ratio tabular grain emulsion" is employed when,
through tabular grain thickening above 0.3 µm and/or
low grain mean ECD, an average aspect ratio in the
range of from 5-8 is exhibited. Generally, tabular
grain emulsions exhibit average tabular grain aspect
ratios of at least 2. The term "thin tabular grain" is 
generally understood to be a tabular grain having a
thickness of less than 0.2 µm. The term "ultrathin
tabular grain" is generally understood to be a tabular
grain having a thickness of 0.06 µm or less. The term
"high chloride" refers to grains that contain at least
50 mole percent chloride based on silver. In referring
to grains of mixed halide content, the halides are
named in order of increasing molar concentrations--e.g.,
silver iodochloride contains a higher molar
concentration of chloride than iodide.The overwhelming majority of tabular grain
emulsions contain tabular grains that are irregular
octahedral grains. Regular octahedral grains contain
eight identical crystal faces, each lying in a
different {111} crystallographic plane. Tabular
irregular octahedra contain two or more parallel twin
planes that separate two major grain faces lying in
{111} crystallographic planes. The {111} major faces
of the tabular grains exhibit a threefold symmetry,
appearing triangular or hexagonal. It is generally
acc
