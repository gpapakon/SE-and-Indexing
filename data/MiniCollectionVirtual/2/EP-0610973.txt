<ABSTRACT>
The present invention provides an easily fabricated optical fiber 
coupler which can be employed in applications calling for miniaturization. 

Optical fibers (24) from which a portion of the coating material has been 
removed thereby exposing the clad (22) are used and two or more of such 

component optical fibers (24) are aligned side by side in a plane and the 
exposed clad (22) of adjacent optical fibers are mutually thermally fused, 

after which the fused region is drawn out, thereby forming a fused-elongated 
region (25) which constitutes the optical fiber coupler. For such an 

optical fiber coupler (21), optical fiber material is used in which the 
softening temperature of the core is higher than that of the clad, and 

further, for the drawing out of the mutually fused sections, the tension 
employed is such that by virtue of remaining stress, the refractive index of 

the core is reduced. By so forming the optical fiber coupler, it is 
possible to reduce the difference in refractive index between the core and 

the clad, widen the mode power distribution, and thereby achieve optical 
coupling between adjacent optical fibers.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention concerns optical fiber couplers
employed in communication systems.In one type of optical fiber coupler known in the art,
two or more fibers are aligned side by side in a plane and
thermally fused and elongated, thereby forming a fused-elongated
region.In the fused-elongated region thus formed, the diameter
of each component optical fiber is reduced, as is the
diameter of the core of each fiber. To the extent that
diameter of the cores of the optical fibers are reduced, a
proportionately larger fraction of the light propagated
therein leaks through the clad which surrounds the core of
each fiber. Also, to the extent that the component optical
fibers are drawn out and thereby elongated, the distance
between the cores of adjacent optical fibers is reduced, and
due to this fact, the coupling between the propagated modes
of the individual fibers becomes extremely great. In this
way, the light signal carried by one fiber branches and is
thus caused to be multiplexed over two or more optical
fibers. However, the above described optical fiber coupling
technique has the following shortcomings:
1. When conventional quartz glass single mode optical fiber
is used to form the optical fiber coupler, because the
properties of the material are such that very little
light energy is lost through the lateral surface of the
fiber, the fused-elongated region must be quite long in
order to sufficiently achieve optical coupling. Further,
in order to form a fused-elongated region of sufficient
length, the resulting diameters of the component optical
fibers in the fused-elongated region end up being
considerably reduced. For example, starting with quartz
optical fibers having an outer diameter of 125 µm, it is
possible that in the fused-elongated region of the
resulting coupler, the fibers have a final outer diameter
of on the order of 20 µm. Because of this effect, even a
relatively small curvature in the optical fiber results
in light leaking through the side of the fiber to the
exterior with loss in light energy. With a larger amount
of bending in the optical fiber, the bending losses
become significant.2. When forming the fused-elongated region, if it is desired
to limit the amount of elongation and still achieve the
desired degree of optical coupling, the length of the
fused region must be considerable. Thus even though the
elongation of the optical fiber has been limited in such
a case, the coupler ends up being quite long.
Accordingly, in answer to applications calling for
miniaturization, such an
