channel. 
A method for cooling metal strips, said method
comprising:


wrapping the metal strip around at least one cooling roll
and adjusting a wrapping length between said strip and the

respective cooling roll by moving the roll,
using gas jet cooling equipment provided with nozzle means
which are opposite the respective roll via the strip so as to

cool the strip on its rear surface by impinging the cooling
gas from the nozzle means,

   characterized by

using one or more nozzle headers which are movable in the
moving direction of the respective roll and along the roll

axis and having a width narrower than that of the strip,
adjusting the wrapping length so as to adjust the average
strip temperature or the temperature in the strip center based

on the deviation from an objective strip temperature,
always observing a temperature distribution in the strip
width at at least one side of the inlet or outlet of the

cooling roll(s), while adjusting the separating distance
between the strip and nozzle headers in accordance with the

position of the roll(s) and the nozzle headers, and moving the
nozzle headers to a position where the temperature deviation

occurring against said objective temperature distribution,
thereby to control the strip temperature distribution based on

the deviation.
The method as claimed in claim 64, characterized by 
adjusting the pressure and the flow rate of the cooling

gas flowed into the nozzle headers based on said temperature
deviation, thereby to control the strip temperature distribution

based on the deviation.
The method as claimed in claim 64, characterized in that
the two nozzle heades are provided to the gas jet cooling equipment,

and these nozzle headers are moved with respect to controlling of the
strip temperature distribution based on the deviation occurring

against the objective strip temperature distribution, aiming at the
part of deviations occurring against the objective strip temperatures

at both strip edges, so as to cancel the deviation.
The method as claimed in claim 66, characterized by,
installing, other

than said two nozzle headers provided to said gas jet cooling
equipment, nozzle headers for the strip center at a position

corresponding to the center in the strip width, said nozzle headers
being only movable in the moving directions of the cooling roll and

immovable along the roll axis, and at the center nozzle headers only
adjusting the pressure and the flow rate of the cooling gas flowed

into the header based on the temperature deviation occurring against
the objective strip temperature distribution with respect to

controlling of the strip temperature distribution based on said
de
viation so as to impinge the cooling gas to the metal strip.

providing three or

more nozzle headers to said gas jet cooling equipment, and 

with respect to controlling of average strip temperature or
center strip temperature based on the deviation against the

objective strip temperature, adjusting the wrapping length between
the metal strip and the cooling roll, and
with respect to controlling of the strip temperature distribution
based on the deviation from the objective strip temperature

distribution, adjusting the separating distance between the metal
strip and these nozzle headers in accordance with the position of the

cooling rolls and the nozzle headers, always observing a temperature
distribution in the strip width at least at the inlet or outlet of the

cooling rolls, moving the edge-positioned nozzle headers to both
strip edges such that cooling widths are to be as shown with the under

formulae 8 and 9, moving the center position of the center positioned

The method as claimed in claim 68, characterized by using
auxiliary gas jet cooling equipment disposed at the outlet of the

cooling rolls and provided, at the upper and rear surfaces of the metal strip,
with three or more nozzle headers movable along the strip width, 

moving the
edge-positioned nozzle headers of the gas cooling equipment and the

auxiliary gas cooling equipment to both strip edges such that cooling
widths are to be as shown with said formulae 8 and 9. 
The method as claimed in claim 69, characetrized by
always observing the temperature distribution in the strip width at

the outlet of the cooling rolls, respectively obtaining positions in
