<ABSTRACT>
An electrical connector (1') has a generally C-shaped 
member (2') for electrically connecting wires (30') 

with a wedge member (12'). The C-shaped member (2') 
comprises radially arranged recesses (7') and holding 

teeth (10') which are adapted to provide tensile strength 
to the wedge member (12') for retaining the wires (30'). 

Indicia marks are provided for correct sizing of the 
connector relative to the wires (30').

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a wedge type connector for conductor
cables of electrical distribution networks, suitable for housing conductor cables of
different sizes, which are placed and secured between a first, generally C-shaped
outer member having teeth and a second wedge type inner member.An example of a known connector is shown in Brazilian Patent Application
PI 9102719, wherein teeth are provided to penetrate through the cables, thus
increasing the tensile value of the conductor cables of the connection.A further known connector is disclosed in Brazilian Patent Application PI
9202511, which is a connector provided with bumpers and a latch to prevent
shifting of the constituent parts of the connector.US-A-4 650 273 discloses an electrical connector having a generally C-shaped
member for electrically connecting wires with a wedge member. The C-shaped
member comprises recesses which are arranged on the bights of the C-shaped
member.The present invention consists in an electrical connector for interconnecting
conductor cables, in which the cables are secured between bights of a generally
C-shaped receptacle and an inner wedge member, characterised by strengthening
recesses extending about the inner peripheries of the bights of the C-shaped
receptacle and forming inwardly directed channels and outwardly directed
protuberances, and holding teeth disposed on the inner peripheries of the bights
between the recesses.Increased tensile value for retention of the wires is thereby provided.An embodiment of the present invention will now be described by way of
example with reference to the accompanying drawings, in which:
Figure 1 is a perspective view showing the C-shaped member 
of a connector, according to an embodiment of the invention,Figure 2 is a perspective view showing a sectioned portion of the
C-shaped member taken along line 2-2 of Figure 1,Figure 3 is a frontal perspective view showing the connector in
an assembled state.Figure 4 is a perspective view of the assembled connector,
showing cables arranged in the connector assembly.As shown in the Figures, connector 1' comprises two pieces
which fit together to secure conductor cables 30' between them. One of
the pieces is a member 2' of generally C-form which is stamped and
formed from a sheet, usually from sheet metal, which is bent in the shape
of a "C". In the bottom portion 3' is provided a ramp 4' adjacent to an
opening 5'.Receptacle 2' has at least two radially arranged recesses 7'
forming inwardly directed channels 8' and outwardly

<CLAIMS>
An electrical connector (1') for interconnecting conductor cables (30'), in
which the cables are secured between bights of a generally C-shaped receptacle

(2') and an inner wedge member (12'), characterised by strengthening recesses
(7') extending about the inner peripheries of the bights of the C-shaped receptacle

(2') and forming inwardly directed channels (8') and outwardly directed
protuberances (9'), and holding teeth (10') disposed on the inner peripheries of the

bights between the recesses (7').
The electrical connector of claim 1, wherein the recesses (7') generally
extend completely across the C-shaped receptacle (2')
The electrical connector of claim 1 or 2, wherein the C-shaped receptacle
(2') is made of stamped and formed sheet metal.
The electrical connector of any preceding claim, wherein the wedge
member (12') has a locking nub (17') which fits into a cooperating opening (5') in

the C-shaped receptacle upon assembly therewith to prevent unlocking of the
wedge member from the receptacle.
