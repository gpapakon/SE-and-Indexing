<ABSTRACT>
A connector for connecting a mother board to a daughter board, both having contacts arranged in a staggered fashion, comprises an insulating body having a channel for receiving the edge of the daughter board and passages for the penetration of flat electrical-connection terminals between corresponding contact areas on the two boards. Each terminal has means for catching on the insulation and a flexible arm intended to slide on one face of the daughter board during the insertion of the latter and to bear on a respective contact area. Every other contact terminal includes catching means (32) which can be snapped onto the insulating body by insertion parallel to the direction of engagement of the second board in the connector, whereas the other contact terminals (22a) can be snapped onto the insulating body by movement orthogonal to the direction of engagement of the second board (16) in the connector.
