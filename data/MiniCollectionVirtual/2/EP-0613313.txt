<ABSTRACT>
An operating system control device (AMO) in a telecommunications 
switch (14) is capable of operating under the control of software instructions 

associated with a new switch feature for executing a series of actions used to 
integrate the new switch feature with the operating system. The operating system 

control device (AMO) further provides the capability operating under the control of 
software instructions for testing the operability of the new switch feature. This 

minimizes the costs associated with the installation of new features and the amount 
of skilled craft personnel time required.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention is directed to electronic telecommunication 
switches and more specifically to the initial installation of a switch and the 
installation of new switch features which may involve additional programs, 
hardware, or both. Modern electronic telecommunication switches are versatile. Such 
switches can be configured to provide a variety of features and functions based on 
the needs of a service provider such as an telephone company. Many features are 
supported by a combination of hardware and software. Because the switches are so 
versatile, installing a new feature and especially the initial installation of a switch in 
a first time application has typically required substantial support from skilled 
installers often referred to as craft personnel. The costs involved in installing a switch may comprise a substantial 
fraction of the overall costs associated with the purchase of the switch. Because of 
the magnitude of hardware and software involved in an installation and because of 
the relatively high labor costs associated with using skilled craft personnel, switch 
installations are costly. Switch manufacturers provide detailed installation 
documentation involving both the installation of hardware and software. Following 
such detailed written documentation can be tedious and time consuming. In 
response to the desire by the switch purchaser to get the switch up and running (or 
the new feature operational), craft personnel may be tempted to rush through the 
recommended procedures or not follow some of the recommended steps or tests. 
This can lead to problems that are difficult to resolve. Although a number of tests are recommended to be made during the 
installation of a switch or a new feature, most of the tests and installation procedures 
are manually implemented by craft personnel. Test results are often monitored on a 
printer connected to the switch to provide the craft personnel with a listing of 
parameters and performance checks made during the test. Manual review of such 
output is time consuming and makes error detection and analysis time consuming. 
Thus, there exists a need for an improved telecommunications switch which 
minimizes installation time and costs by automating installation procedures and 
tests.  It is an object of the present invention to provide an improved 
telecommunications switch which automates installation processes and tests thereby 
minimizing the installation costs and the amount of support needed from craft 
personnel. In accordance with an

In a telecommunications switch including means for establishing 
communication paths between pairs of subscriber channels, and means for providing 

operating system (O.S.) control of the switch based on software instructions, an 
improvement in installing a new switch feature characterized by: 

   said O.S. control means including means operating under the control of 
software instructions associated with said new switch feature for executing a series 

of actions to integrate said new switch feature with said O.S. control means; 
   said O.S. control means including means operating under the control of 

software instructions for testing the operability of said new switch feature with said 
switch following said series of actions, the integration and testing of said new switch 

feature on the switch facilitated by capabilities of the O.S. control means on which 

the feature is installed. 
The switch according to claim 1 wherein said executing means
