<ABSTRACT>
A ditch cover made by covering the top surface of a 
steel base structure (1) with water permeable resin 

mortar (6) laid on a steel plate having water holes, 
finishing the surface to a smooth state, and adjusting 

the top edge of side plates (2) of the base structure to 
the same level as the surface of the mortar.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a cover for a 
ditch or the like, for example a catch-basin cover to be 
placed over a gutter or a drainage ditch along a road or 
in a park. Generally gutters provided on one or both sides of 
a road, and catch basins or drainage ditches in a park, 
are covered by ditch covers or catch-basin covers, and 
usually lattice covers made of concrete or cast iron or 
steel frames are used. A function required from such a 
cover is to provide a safe passage for pedestrians or 
vehicles as well as smooth drainage. Also their weight 
must allow for easy opening or closing. In the case of a concrete cover, the weight is 
generally heavy, the strength and the drainage 
performance are rather inadequate, and in addition it is 
necessary to provide water holes in the concrete base 
plate. On the other hand, in case of a cast iron 
lattice cover or a steel frame, although the strength 
and the drainage performance are adequate, the openings 
in them are large, which causes problems in pedestrian 
safety. For this reason, cast iron lattice covers or 
steel gratings having small crevices, i.e. the so-called 
small-crevice types of cover, have been devised and 
used. However, the cast iron lattice covers or steel 
gratings as described above, and the so-called small-crevice 
type of cover, all have crevices through which 
refuse, fallen leaves, cigarette ends, or other foreign 
materials can drop into the ditch and pile up therein so 
as to prevent water from draining smoothly, so that 
cleaning must be carried out periodically. In addition, 
sometimes high-heeled shoes may be caught in the 
crevices, which may injure a pedestrian. Furthermore it  
 
is difficult to manufacture the small-crevice type of 
cover. According to the present invention there is 
provided a water permeable cover for a ditch, gutter or 
the like, comprising a metal base structure, the 
periphery of which comprises side plates, topped with 
water permeable resin mortar comprising a mixture of 
granular aggregate and synthetic resin binder, the 
mortar being laid on a metal plate formed with water 
holes, and the top surface being finished to a smooth 
state. Preferably top edges of the said side plates are at 
the same level as the surface of the mortar layer. The water permeable resin mortar preferably 
comprises a mixture of aggregate with a granule diameter 
of 10 mm or less and synthetic resin binder, or a 
mixture made by mixing and kneading aggregate with a 
granule diameter of 10 mm or less, and soft

A cover as claimed in claim 1, wherein the top 
edges of the said side plates are at the same level as 

the surface of the mortar layer. 
A cover as claimed in claim 1 or 2, wherein the 
said water permeable resin mortar comprises a mixture 

made by appropriately mixing and kneading aggregate such 
as gravel, various types of debris, slug from a blast 

furnace or a converter and broken stone with a synthetic 
resin binder comprising such materials as urethane, 

epoxy, polyester, and acryl to bind the aggregate, or a 
mixture made by mixing the aforesaid aggregate with soft 

aggregate such as rubber chips or urethane chips.
