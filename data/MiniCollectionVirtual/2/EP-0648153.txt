<ABSTRACT>
A process and device for applying hard material to the teeth (12) of cutting tools, especially saw blades (10). Owing to its surface tension, the molten material (56) forms a cap (58) in a moulding cavity (40) formed around a tooth (12). The molten material (56) is cooled in the hollow (40) and then reheated until an at least approximately fluid state is attained. Only then is pressure progressively applied to the cap (58) towards the blade point (58), by means of which the cap (58) is flattened. This improves the accuracy of the shape and the durability of the teeth (12) formed from molten and subsequently hardened material (56).

<CLAIMS>
A method of applying hard material to cutting tool 
teeth (12), especially the teeth of saw blades (10), wherein 


a mold cavity (40) is defined around a tooth (12) and 
the molten material (56), due to its surface tension, forms 

a spherical segment (58) therein, and 
the spherical segment (58) is flattened under pressure 
applied progressively in a direction towards the tip (18) 

of the tooth, 
characterized
 in that
 
the molten material (56) is cooled and subsequently heated 

again until it has reached a state which is at least 
approximately liquid before the pressure is applied to 

the spherical segment (58). 
The method as claimed in claim 1,
characterized
 in that the molten material (56) 
remains in the mold cavity (40) until it has been reheated 

after the cooling. 
An apparatus for applying hard material to cutting 
tool teeth (12), especially the teeth of saw blades (10), 

and especially for carrying out the method as claimed in 
claim 1 or 2, comprising 


mold jaws (42) adapted for engagement with a tooth (12) 
and defining a mold cavity (40), 
supply means (46) for supplying the material, 
a melting device (52) for melting the material, so that 
it forms a spherical segment in the mold cavity (40),  

 
and a pressing tool (82) to exert pressure on the spherical 
segment (58) formed of the molten material (56) 
characterized
 in that
 
the pressing tool (82) is a plate and that means are provided 

to move said plate at least approximately parallel 
to itself in the direction of the tip (18) of the tooth, 

and beyond the same, along an arcuate path (84) which is 
concave as seen from the spherical segment (58). 
The apparatus as claimed in claim 3,
characterized
 in that the pressing tool (82) 
is connected firmly to a cam follower (80) which is movable 

back and forth along an arcuate guide means (76).
