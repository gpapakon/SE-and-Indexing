<ABSTRACT>
A hydrodynamic device for generating negative pressure excursions in a pulp slurry during fine screening, includes at least one half-foil member (123) disposed on a substantially cylindrical outer surface of a rotor (121). The rotor (121) is mounted within and co-axial with a substantially cylindrical screen (95) having a circumferentially continuous apertured zone to define an annular screening chamber (93) between the rotor (121) and the screen (95). The half-foil member (123) is collectively at least axially co-extensive with the apertured zone and has a leading edge which, also collectively, is inclined at a spiral angle (33) relative to the axis of the rotor (121) such that, in one embodiment, during rotation, the leading edge of the half-foil member (123) conducts large particles downwardly through the screening chamber (93). A selection of hydrodynamic foil configurations is provided in order to adapt to a wide range of pulp types and screening conditions.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a hydrodynamic device for 
generating negative pressure excursions in a pulp and more 
particularly to a screening apparatus for papermaking pulp. The quality of pulp is, to a large extent, determined by 
its freedom from contamination with shives, woody 
particles, dirt and coarse fibres. Shives and woody particles are usually small fibre bundles 
which are held together by a small amount of undigested 
lignin. Their presence to excess in commercial pulp 
results in reduced value and may cause downgrading of the 
pulp. Dirt may be of organic or inorganic composition. Inorganics 
include small pieces of sand or other grit, while organics 
may be residual particles of bark or pitch agglomerations. 
Typically, these are visible to the unaided eye and are 
usually of a different colour from the pulp. Since they 
all have various adverse effects, they also cause 
downgrading of the pulp and a consequent reduction of 
value. The presence of any or all of these is undesirable and many 
techniques for their separation have been developed with 
widely varying operating success records. These usually 
involve screening performed in a chamber in which relative 
motion is created between the screen and some agitation 
device such as a rotor or a hydrodynamic foil, one of which 
may be movable. The most common shortcomings of available 
separation machines are their inability to remove  
 
sufficient shives without also removing an undesirable 
quantity of good fibre; the tendency to block the screen 
with anything other than the lowest consistency of pulp; 
the tendency for the liquid component of the pulp 
suspension to pass more readily than the fibres through the 
screen, resulting in a progressive increase of consistency 
from the pulp feed to rejects discharge which results in 
unstable operation of the screening apparatus; the damage 
and wear caused to the screen and rotor by coarse particles 
caught between them; the consumption of excessive power for 
supplying the pulp and for screening; and the progressive 
damage to the pulp fibres caused by dissipation of the 
excessive energy used in the process. Ideally, a screening apparatus would remove all shives and 
foreign particles from high consistency pulp without any of 
the good fibres being lost, without requiring any addition 
of dilution liquor and without more than the minimum 
consumption of energy. In reality, employment of a screen 
with perforations fine enough to remove all undesirable 
material usually results in

A hydrodynamic device (100) for generating negative 
pressure excursions in a pulp slurry during fine screening, 

comprising at least one half-foil member (123) disposed on 
a substantially cylindrical outer surface (130) of a rotor 

(121), said rotor being mounted within and co-axial with a 
substantially cylindrical screen (95) having a 

circumferentially continuous apertured zone to define an 
annular screening chamber (93) between said rotor and said 

screen, said at least one half-foil member (123) having an 
axial extent at least equal to that of said apertured zone,

accelerating said pulp slurry to a desired circumferential 
velocity for screening comprises an extension (125) on one 

or more of said half-foil members, said extension
