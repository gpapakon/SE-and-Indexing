<ABSTRACT>
In a pressure-swing adsorption-type gas separation unit, a distinct intermediate gas passageway is formed between a first water retaining bed (A) and a second separating adsorbent bed (B), a controlled heat flow being supplied to prevent a very cold area being formed between both beds. Application especially in the production of oxygen from air.

PSA process for producing a gas by separating a 
gaseous mixture containing this gas in at least one 

adsorption unit comprising, combined in pairs, in 
series in a circuit for producing the said gas, a first 

bed (A) of water-retaining adsorbent and a second 
bed (B) of separating adsorbent, comprising a step of 

gas production, in which the gaseous mixture passes 
through the first bed then through the second bed in 

turn, characterized in that it comprises the following 
steps: 


forming an intermediate portion (5) for the 
passage of gas which extends only a short distance and 

makes a permanent direct communication between the 
first bed (A) and the second bed (B); and 
applying a flow of heat to the intermediate 
passage portion in order to raise its temperature. 
Process according to Claim 1, characterized in 
that it comprises the step of placing the intermediate 

passage portion (5) in a permanent heat-exchange 
relation with a hot source (6; 10; 11). 
Process according to Claim 2, characterized in 
that the hot source is a gas. 
Process according to one of the preceding 
claims, characterized in that the gaseous mixture is 

air and the gas produced is oxygen. 
Process according to one of Claims 1 to 4, 
characterized in that the temperature of the  

 
intermediate gas passage portion is maintained at a 

value not below -20Â°C. 
Adsorption unit for implementing the process 
according to one of the preceding claims comprising, in 

series in a circuit for producing the said gas, a 
gaseous mixture inlet (10), a combined pair comprising 

a first bed (A) and a second bed (B) of adsorbent, and 
an outlet (2) for the said gas, characterized in that 

it comprises an intermediate circuit portion (5) which 
extends only a short distance and directly connects at 

least a downstream part of the first bed (A) with at 
least an upstream part of the second bed (B) and which 

is associated with means (6; 10; 11; 14) for applying a 
flow of heat at least to the gas passing through the 

intermediate circuit portion. 
Unit according to Claim 6, characterized in 
that the intermediate circuit portion (5) defines a gas 

passage of small cross section between the adsorbent 
beds (A, B). 
Unit according to Claim 6 or Claim 7, 
characterized in that at least part of the intermediate 

circuit portion is in a heat-exchange relation with a 
hot source (10; 11). 
Unit according to Claim 8, characterized in 
that the hot source is a gas. 
Unit according to Claim 8 or Claim 9, 
characterized in that the hot source is a heat 

generator (7; 10; 11). 
Unit according to one of Claims 6 to 10, 
characterized in that the first bed (A) and the second 

bed (B) are arranged respectively in a first casing (3) 
and in a second casing (4) which are adjacent. 
Unit according to Claim 11, characterized in 
that the two casings are annular, the intermediate 

circuit portion being annular. 
Unit according to Claim 12, characterized in 
that the first bed (A) and the second bed (B) are 

thermally insulated (12) at their periphery.
