<ABSTRACT>
Device for connecting and blocking a support section (1) comprising a plane face (4) to be set in contact with the side (5), which is also plane, of a rafter (2) or other similar structural element, this section comprising a platform (6) forming a bearing shoulder (7) extending perpendicularly to its plane face on which the rafter rests. According to the invention, this device is characterised in that it comprises a bolt (10) made in two parts, one of which is in the form of a plate (11) and can be received in an open housing (9) made in the platform of the bearing shoulder and has a through hole (27) for the second part of this bolt, which consists of a finger (12) with shouldered head (13), solidly attached to the rafter, this passage being extended into the plate by at least one longitudinal groove (28, 29) whose direction makes a closed angle with the contact face of the supporting section, the shouldered head of the finger being applied onto the opposite surface of the plate of the bolt which is shaped into a wedge in order also to form a closed angle with the plane of the bearing shoulder.

<CLAIMS>
Assembly formed of a support profile (1) and of 
a rafter (2) or of a similar structural element, these 

being joined together by a device for connecting and 
blocking one with respect to the other, the support 

profile including a flat contact face (4) against which 
the flank (5), also flat, of the rafter is applied, this 

connection device consisting of a catch made in two parts 
one of which, in the form of a small plate (11) has a 

passage hole (27) for the second part which consists of 
a pin (12) with a shouldered head (13), this passage 

being extended into the small plate by at least one 
longitudinal slot (28, 29), the direction of which makes 

an acute angle with the contact face of the support 
profile, characterized in that the support profile (1) 

has a platform (6) comprising a shoulder (7) on which the 
rafter (2) can rest, this platform extending at right 

angles to the flat contact face (4) of the profile and 
delimiting with the rafter an open housing (9) which 

accommodates the small plate of the catch which includes 
a heel (24) bearing on the platform (6), the pin (12) 

forming the second part of this catch being secured to 
the rafter and extending therefrom to situate its shouldered 

head (13) beyond the passage (27) provided in the 
small plate (11) against the surface thereof, which is 

cut as a wedge shape in order also to form an acute angle 
with the plane of the bearing shoulder (7). 
Assembly according to Claim 1, characterized in 
that the small plate (11) of the catch (10) includes two 

identical slots (28, 29) which are symmetric and opposed 
and emerge transversely in the passage hole (27) accommodating  

 
the pin (12) secured to the rafter (2), the width 

of each of these slots being such that this finger can 
run freely along the slot in which it is fitted, shifting 

the rafter with respect to the support profile (1) so as 
to press its flank (5) tightly against the flat contact 

face (4) of this profile. 
Assembly according to either one of Claims 1 and 
2, characterized in that the small plate (11) of the 

catch (10) has a rectangular contour and includes, along 
one of its long sides, a projecting border (20) having a 

cross section of substantially circular profile which can 
be engaged in a groove (21) of the same section made in 

the housing (9) of the platform (6) of the shoulder (7) 
of the support profile (1) which accommodates this small 

plate. 
Assembly according to Claim 3, characterized in 
that the small plate (11) at the opposite end to its 

projecting border (20) includes a flat heel (24) designed 
to press against the bottom of the housing (9) in order 

to immobilize the small plate with respect to the support 
profile (1) after its border has been engaged in the 

groove (21) of the housing in a raised position and after 
this border has been pivoted towards the shoulder (7) on 

the circular profile of this groove. 
Assembly according to Claim 4, characterized in 
that the shoulder (7) of the support profile (1) has a 

flared exterior rim (31) which closes the housing (9) of 
the platform (6) beyond the heel (24) of the small plate 

(11), this rim being equipped with a deformable fin (32) 
for blocking this small plate. 
Assembly according to any one of Claims 1 to 5, 
characterized in that the pin (12) with shouldered head 

(13) borne by the rafter (2) includes a threaded end (15) 
interacting on either side of a pierced hole (16) in the 

rafter respectively with a nut (17) and a washer (18), 
immobilizing the pin in an adjustable position in which 

its shouldered head projects under the rafter for sufficient 
distance to allow it to pass through the passage 

hole (27) provided in the small plate (11) of the catch  
 

(10) while coming into contact on the opposite face (30) 
thereof, which face is cut as a wedge, in such a way that 

the shifting of the small plate with respect to the pin 
also and at the same time causes the rafter to be applied 

against the shoulder.
