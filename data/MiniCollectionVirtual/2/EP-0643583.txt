<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to medicaments for use
in improved methods for detecting tumors and lesions in
the course of intraoperative, intravascular and
endoscopic examination using a small detection probe.Surgical resection remains the primary curative
approach in the management of cancer.According to R.O. Dillman, Surgical Clinics of N. America, vol.
67 No. 5(1989) pages 592-603, brachytherapy has also been used,
in combination with laser therapy, for treating cancers such as
bronchogenic carcinoma.Radioimmunodetection (RAID) is used to locate and stage
tumors, and to monitor post-operative patients, by
external imaging, after injection of a radiolabeled
antibody. Antibodies and/or antibody fragments which
specifically bind antigens produced by or associated with
tumors ("anti-cancer antibodies") are used as carriers
for radiolabels in RAID. It will be appreciated that a
tumor antigen can serve as a target for an antibody
carrier even if it is not present in serum in a
detectable amount.Resolution is affected by several factors that can
limit the size of a tumor, especially a metastasis, which
can be imaged by RAID. Non-invasive RAID is inherently
limited by the distance between the radiation detector
and the tumor. In the case of small, deep-stated
metastatic tumors, this becomes the limiting factor in
their detection.Second-look surgery has been practiced where
recurrence of a previously excised primary tumor was
indicated by elevated levels of tumor marker, e.g.,
carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA). Recently, a small gamma
detection probe has been developed which is capable of
detecting gamma emission at short distances. Its
intraoperative use in second-look surgery has been
reported to provide important information to the surgeon 
for determining safe margins for resection and for
detecting small metastases, by Aitken et al., Dis. Colon
& Rectum, 27, 279-282(1984).Nevertheless, elevated background radiation levels
can interfere with and vitiate the advantage of short
measuring distances in this technique. In addition, non-specific
immunoglobulin uptake by tumor tissue can
complicate diagnosis.U.S. Patent 4,782,840 discloses a method for
reducing the effect of elevated background radiation
levels during surgery. The method is to inject the
patient with antibodies specific for neoplastic tissue
and which are labeled with radioisotopes having a
suitably long half-life, such as Iodine-125. After
injection of the radiolabeled antibody, the surgery is
delayed at least 7-10 days, preferably 14-21 days,
