<ABSTRACT>
An apparatus (5) is disclosed for internally holding an at least partially hollow 
substrate (35) having at least one open end. The apparatus (5) includes a member (10) 

defining a fluid passageway (15), a normally inflated porous material (25) mounted on the 
member (10) in communication (20) with the fluid passageway (15) of the member, and means, 

in communication with the member, for deflating the porous material (25), the deflating 
means being de-energized in response to the porous material (25) being disposed into the 

opening in the substrate (35) for enabling the porous material (25) to return to being normally 
inflated to hold the substrate.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates generally to an apparatus and method for internally holding a 
hollow substrate. More particularly, the invention pertains to an apparatus and method for 
holding the inner surface of a hollow substrate by employing a gripping device which normally 
engages the substrate's inner surface until the device is subjected to a suction force, in which 
case, the device releases the substrate. Conventional substrate holding devices grip the insides of a hollow substrate by 
using an inflatable member which must be inflated or expanded by a mechanical device 
including for example an air pump. Known gripping devices are disclosed in US-A-4,783,108, US-A-4,680,246, US-A-3,945,486, 
and US-A-3,777,875. There is a need, which the present invention addresses, for new apparatus and 
methods for internally gripping a hollow substrate which is simple and economical to 
implement. The present invention provides an apparatus for internally holding a substrate 
having an opening in at least a portion thereof, comprising: (a) a member defining a fluid 
passageway; (b) a normally inflated porous material mounted on the member in 
communication with the fluid passageway of the member; and (c) means, in communication 
with the member, for deflating the porous material, the deflating means being de-energized in 
response to the porous material being disposed into the opening in the substrate for enabling 
the porous material to return to being normally inflated to hold the substrate. The invention fruther provides a method for internally holding a substrate having an 
opening in at least a portion thereof, comprising: (a) reducing fluid pressure on a porous 
material to withdraw fluid therefrom to deflate at least a portion of the material; (b) inserting 
at least a portion of the deflated material in the opening of the substrate; and (c) terminating 
at least partially the reducing step so that the porous material takes in fluid and inflates to hold 
the substrate. Other aspects of the present invention will become apparent as the following 
description proceeds and upon reference to the Figures which represent preferred 
embodiments: 
Figure 1 depicts an elevational sectional view of one embodiment of the substrate 
holding device; Figure 2 depicts an elevational sectional view of another embodiment of the 
substrate holding device; Figure 3 depicts a perspective view, partially in section, of still another embodiment 
of the substrate holding device; and  Figure 4 depicts an elevational sectional view

<CLAIMS>
An apparatus for internally holding a substrate having an opening in at least a 
portion thereof, comprising: 


(a) a member defining a fluid passageway; 
(b) a normally inflated porous material mounted on the member in 
communication with the fluid passageway of the member; and 
(c) means, in communication with the member, for deflating the porous material, 
the deflating means, in use, being de-energisable for enabling the porous material to return to 

being normally inflated to hold the substrate. 
The apparatus of claim 1, further comprising a flexible barrier layer which overlays 
the porous material, the barrier layer preferably comprising rubber. 
The apparatus of claim 1 or 2, wherein the deflating means comprises a suction 
device which communicates with the fluid passageway of the member for creating a suction 

force. 
The apparatus of claim 1, 2 or 3, wherein the fluid passageway defined by the 
member (1) comprises a chamber and an opening in communication with the porous material, 

or (2) comprises pores. 
The apparatus of any of the preceding claims, wherein the member (1) has a closed 
end, (2) is tubular, or (3) is substantially rigid and is preferably made from a metal or a plastic 

material. 
The apparatus of any of the preceding claims, wherein the porous material (1) covers 
the entire outer surface of the member in a substantially continuous layer, (2) covers selected 

portions of the outer surface of the member, or (3) comprises open cell foam. 
The apparatus of any of the preceding claims, wherein the member comprises a 
substantially planar end region, with the porous material disposed on the surface of the planar 

end region. 
The apparatus of any of the preceding claims, wherein the normally inflated porous 
material has a thickness ranging from about 1 mm to about 5 cm. 
A method for internally holding a substrate having an opening in at least a portion 
thereof, comprising: 


(a) reducing fluid pressure on a porous material to withdraw fluid therefrom to 
deflate at least a portion of the material; 
(b) inserting at least a portion of the deflated material in the opening of the 
substrate; and 
(c) terminating at least partially the reducing step so that the porous material 
takes in fluid and inflates to hold the substrate. 
The method of claim 9, wherein the step (a) comprises decreasing the thickness of the 

material by an amount ranging from about 10% to about 80%, and/or step (b) comprises 
positioning the deflated material inside the substrate along a length of the substrate ranging 

from about 1/4 to about 3/4 of the substrate length.
