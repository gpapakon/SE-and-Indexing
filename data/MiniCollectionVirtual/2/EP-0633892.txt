<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a novel
polymorphic form of N-t-butyl-androst-3,5-diene-17β-carboxamide-3-carboxylic
acid.Figure I is an Infra-red Spectrum of N-t-butyl-androst-3,5-diene-17β-carboxylic
acid polymorph A.Figure II is an enhanced FT-IR spectra of the 3399-3501
cm-1 region of Polymorph A disclosing the
characteristic N-H stretch of Polymorph A.N-t-butyl-androst-3,5-diene-17β-carboxamide-3-carboxylic
acid is a compound which is disclosed and
claimed as being useful in the treatment of benign
prostatic hypertrophy in U.S. Patent No. 5,017,568,
(European 0289327A). Said compound can be prepared by
methods such as described in U.S. Patent No. 5,017,568:
Example 28(iv) describes the product being
recrystallised by dissolving a reaction product in ethyl
ether, adding ethyl acetate and concentration. Example 28 B (iv) describes the product being recrystallised from ethyl acetate at ambient temperatures. The
isolation 
and identification of the polymorphic forms of said
compound is advantageous in identifying desirable
physical characteristics of the different crystal forms
of said compound.It has now been found that a polymorphic form
(hereinafter Polymorph A) of the compound N-t-butyl-androst-3,5-diene-17β-carboxamide-3-carboxylic
acid can
be obtained in a high state of polymorphic purity by
stirring a 12-40% by weight slurry of N-t-butyl-androst-3,5-diene-17β-carboxamide-3-carboxylic
acid in ethyl
acetate for about an hour, at a temperature above 60°C,
then stirring said slurry at a temperature of from about
0-5°C with subsequent isolation of the Polymorph A. Presently, N-t-butyl-androst-3,5-diene-17β-carboxamide-3-carboxylic
acid is known to assume only
two polymorphic forms, A and B.Polymorph A and Polymorph B were individually
subjected to intense grinding in a mortar with a pestle
for a period of approximately five minutes. Infra-red
spectral absorbencies of the post-grinding Polymorph B
compound indicated that approximately 5-10% of said
polymorph had converted to the Polymorph A form. Infra-red
spectral absorbencies of the post-grinding Polymorph
A compound indicated retentiqn of polymorphic identity
and purity. The above findings indicate that the
polymorphic A form of N-t-butyl-androst-3,5-diene-17β-carboxamide-3-carboxylic
acid is thermodynamically more
stable than the polymorphic B form. The
themodynamically more stable polymorphic form of a
compound is advantageous for maintaining crystal
integrity during manufacture, storing, shipping and
handling of solid compositions of said
