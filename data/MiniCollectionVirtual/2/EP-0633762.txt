<ABSTRACT>
A fluid pervious web comprised of a nonwoven material for use as a topsheet (28) on an absorbent article (20) is disclosed. The nonwoven web has a patterned network of pigmented fluid impervious areas (36) thereon. Fluid deposited on the wearer-contacting surface (28A) of the web is moved laterally away from the pigmented fluid impervious areas (36) and transported through the fluid pervious portions of the web. Thus leaving the pigmented fluid impervious areas of the web clean and dry. This structure provides a topsheet (28) that is tactilely perceived as soft prior to the discharge of bodily fluids thereon and also clean and dry after bodily fluids have been deposited thereon.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to absorbent articles such as 
sanitary napkins, diapers, and incontinent articles, and the like, 
and more particularly, to such absorbent articles having a nonwoven 
topsheet with fluid impervious areas thereon. All manner and variety of absorbent articles configured for the 
absorption of bodily fluids are, of course, well known. Current 
types of absorbent articles include sanitary napkins, diapers, and 
incontinent articles. A topsheet is the portion of an absorbent article which covers 
one face of the absorbent article which typically contacts the skin 
of the person using the absorptive devise. It has long been known in 
the disposable absorbent article art that it is extremely desirable 
to construct absorptive devices, such as disposable sanitary napkins, 
diapers, incontinent articles, and the like, with a topsheet 
providing a tactilely soft feel to the user prior to the discharge of 
bodily fluids thereon and also provide a clean and dry surface after 
the discharge of bodily fluids thereon. U.S. Pat. No. 4,041,951 issued to Sanford on August 16, 1977 
discloses a preferred 
disposable diaper structure comprising a substantially planar, 
moisture absorbent layer disposed between a soft topsheet and a 
moisture-resistant backing sheet. The nonwoven fibrous topsheet 
preferably comprises an integral structure containing a multiplicity 
of depressed areas which intimately contact the uppermost surface of 
a substantially planar, moisture absorbent layer. The nondepressed 
areas of the topsheet contact the wearer's skin in-use. This 
nonwoven fibrous topsheet is particularly well suited for the user 
who prefers the soft feel of a nonwoven topsheet prior to the 
discharge of bodily fluids thereon. However, this nonwoven fibrous  
 
topsheet does not provide a visually clean and dry surface after 
bodily fluids, e.g., menses or blood, have been discharged thereon. EPO 449 271 discloses a disposable absorbent article comprising an absorbent padding 
positioned between a liquid permeable upper layer and a liquid impervious lower layer. The 
padding is adhered to the upper layer in a dot formation to prevent movement whilst 
retaining flexibility.  
 U.S. Pat. No. 4,798,608 issued to Meyer et al. on January 17, 
1989 discloses an 
absorbent article having a hydrophobic transport layer. A nonwoven 
topsheet is superposed in facing relation with the absorbent body, 
and has an effective average pore size therein. A transport layer is 
located between the absorbent body

<CLAIMS>
A fluid pervious web (28) comprised of a nonwoven material having a first 
surface (28A) characterised in that said first surface of said web having a patterned network of pigmented 

fluid impervious areas thereon (36), said first surface of said web (28A) adapted to move 

fluid deposited thereon laterally away from said pigmented fluid impervious 
areas (36) and to transport said fluid through said fluid pervious portions of said 

web, such that said pigmented fluid impervious areas (36) of said web are clean and 
dry. 
The fluid pervious web of Claim 1, wherein said pigmented fluid 
impervious areas are pigmented with titanium dioxide. 
The fluid pervious web of Claim 1, wherein said nonwoven material is 
a carded material. 
The fluid pervious web of Claim 1, wherein said nonwoven material is 
a spunbonded material. 
The fluid pervious web of Claim 1, wherein said pigmented fluid 
impervious areas are cellulose acetate. 
The fluid pervious web of Claim 1, wherein said nonwoven material is 
apertured. 
The fluid pervious web of Claim 6, wherein said pigmented fluid 
impervious areas cover from 10 percent to 70 percent of said first surface. 
An absorbent bandage (20) comprising a wearer-contacting topsheet (28) and an 
absorbent element (32) for absorbing bodily fluids, said topsheet (28) comprising a fluid 

pervious web comprised of a nonwoven material having a first surface (28A) for 
contacting the wearer and a second surface (28B) for contacting said absorbent 

element, characterised in that said first surface of said web (28A) has a pattern network of pigmented 
fluid impervious areas (36) thereon, said first surface of said web (28A) adapted to move 

fluid deposited thereon laterally away from said pigmented fluid impervious 
areas (36) and to transport said fluid through said fluid pervious portions of said 

web, such that said pigmented fluid impervious areas (36) of said web are clean and 
dry.  

 
The absorbent bandage of Claim 8, including a backsheet resistant to 
the passage of aqueous fluid therethrough secured to said absorbent bandage 

adjacent the surface of said absorbent element opposite said topsheet. 
The structure of either Claim 8 or Claim 9, wherein said absorbent 
bandage comprises a disposable sanitary napkin.
