<ABSTRACT>
This invention is a relay terminal which can 
accurately detect malfunctions of relays. Detection coils 

are connected in series to relay contacts on load circuits. 
By detecting the magnetic flux generated in the coils, a 

current detection circuit, which contains a Hall element, 
determines if a current is flowing in the load circuits. 

Detection signals, which indicate the presence or absence 
of a current, and outputs from the relay coils are 

processed in a transmission control circuit. A malfunction 
detection signal indicating whether or not a malfunction 

has occurred is transmitted to a programmable controller 
via a driver/receiver circuit. If a malfunction has 

occurred, display means flash on and off.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention concerns a relay terminal which is 
capable of transmitting detection signals when malfunctions 
are detected in the relay load circuits. A conventional relay terminal array consists of a 
number of relays whose contacts are connected to load 
circuits. Each load circuit is switched on or off in 
accordance with the contact state of the relay coil. Some 
conventional relay terminals are not able to transmit 
signals whether or not there is contact while other 
conventional relay terminals can. Conventional relay 
terminals of the type described above, however, cannot 
detect malfunctions. When such a relay becomes fused or a 
contact becomes intermittent, the malfunction cannot be 
immediately detected in the control center. The delay in 
detecting the malfunctioning relay causes down time and 
other problems. From EP-A-0 616 346, which is a document according to Art. 
54 (3) EPC for all designated countries, a relay terminal 
array is known having a plurality of relays, each of said 
plurality of relays having a relay coil such that excitation 
of said relay coil causes a relay contact, said relay terminal 
array comprising: a current detection circuit for detecting 
the presence or absence of a current in a load circuit 
of said relays and outputting detection signals, and a 
transmission control circuit for comparing said detection 
signals from said current detection circuit with a state 
signal from each of said relay coils, to determine if a 
malfunction has occurred in said relays, said transmission 
control circuit outputting a malfunction detection signal 
when a malfunction has occurred. FR-A-2 565 430 discloses a relay terminal having a 
relay coil such that excitation of said relay coil causes a 
relay contact, said relay terminal comprising: a current 
detection circuit for detecting the presence or absence of a 
current in a load circuit of said relay and outputting detection 
signals, and a transmission control circuit for 
comparing said detection signals from said current detection 
circuit with a state signal from said relay coil, to determine 
if a malfunction has occurred in said relay, said 
transmission control circuit outputting a malfunction 
detection signal when a malfunction has occurred. This invention considers the problem described above. 
One advantage of this invention that the relay terminal 
array is capable of detecting malfunctions and transmitting 
the status of the relay terminal to the main control unit. This invention in an embodiment, provides a
