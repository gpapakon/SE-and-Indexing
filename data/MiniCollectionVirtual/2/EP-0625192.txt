<ABSTRACT>
Nucleozymes containing ribonucleotides and deoxyribonucleotides or nucleic acid analogues are described herein. The nucleozymes have catalytic activity and are significantly more resistant to degradation than their all-RNA ribozyme connterparts. Also described are methods for preparing the nucleozymes along with methods of using nucleozymes, e.g., as therapeutic agents.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to nucleozymes, mixed
nucleic acid polymers having catalytic activity. The
invention also relates to methods of preparing and
using nucleozymes.Proteins were the only known catalysts of
cellular reactions until the discovery of RNA
catalysts (ribozymes). In some instances, the folded
structure of a ribozyme catalyses a cleavage reaction
on another part of the same molecule (cis-reaction).
In other instances (trans-reaction), the ribozyme may
also act as a catalyst on another RNA or DNA molecule
(substrate) by cleaving or ligating pieces of the
substrate without changing itself in the process.
(Zaug etal. Science, Vol. 231, pp. 470-75, 1986;
Cech Science, Vol. 236, pp. 1532-39, 1987).A well-characterized example of a ribozyme is
the self-splicing Group I intron from the nuclear
rRNA of Tetrahymenathermophila. An intron is an
intervening sequence in a eukaryotic gene which does
not encode a protein or in rare cases encodes a
different protein. Introns are transcribed along
with coding sequences (exons) to produce precursor
RNA. The introns are removed from the precursor RNA
and the exons are ligated by RNA cleaving and
splicing steps. The Group I intron or ribozyme of T.thermophila catalyzes its own removal from the
precursor RNA molecule. (Kruger etal.Cell 
31:147-157, (1982); Zaug etal. (1986)). The
self-splicing ribozyme catalyzes a variety of
phosphodiester transfer reactions. The ribozyme can
act as a ribonuclease, ligase, phosphotransferase,
acid phosphatase, polymerase and RNA restriction
endonuclease (Zaug, A.J., etal., Science231:470-475
(1986); Zaug, A.J., etal., Nature324:429-433
(1986); Zaug, A.J., etal., Biochemistry25:4478-4482
(1986); Been, M.D., etal., Science239:1412-1416
(1988); Doudna etal.,Nature339:519-522 (1989);The "hammerhead" and "hairpin" ribozymes also
have been studied and described (Perreault etal.,
Nature 344:565-567 (1990); Perreault etal.
Biochemistry 30:4020-25 (1991); Yang etal.
Biochemistry 29:11156-60 (1990); Chowrira etal.
Biochemistry 30:8518-22 (1991); Uhlenbeck Nature,
328:596-600 (1987)). The hammerhead ribozyme forms a
stem loop secondary structure to form the
catalytically active molecule. The hairpin ribozyme
has a structure resembling a hairpin.Rossi etal. WO91/03162 describe a modified
hammerhead ribozyme comprising a ribozyme catalytic
centre and deoxyribonucleotides in place of
ribonucleotides external to the catalytic centre.
Pieken etal.Science 253: 314-317 (1991) describe
modified hammerhead ribozymes incorporating 2'-fluoro-and
2'-a
