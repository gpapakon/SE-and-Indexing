<ABSTRACT>
A method and device (20) for intracorporeal knot tying. The device comprises an elongated, tubular member (22) formed of a shape memory material for carrying a suture thread (25) through an internal passage. A distal end (23) of the tube is formed with a bight (28). An outer sheath (21) supports the remaining length of the tube (22). When a knot is to be formed, a free end of the suture (25) is pulled through the performed bight (28). The tube and sheath then move relative to each other to straighten the bight (28) and throw off a knot in the suture thread (25) for subsequent tightening.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention generally relates to surgical 
apparatus and procedures and more specifically to a device 
for facilitating intracorporeal knot tying 
during endoscopic surgical procedures. In endoscopic surgical procedures, all the techniques 
of dissection, cutting, suturing and knot tying must be 
performed with various elongated instruments that extend 
through trocars into a cavity of a patient. These 
instruments include needle holders, tissue graspers, 
introducers and related instruments for facilitating both 
extracorporeal and intracorporeal knot tying during 
endoscopic surgical procedures. Many of these systems 
utilize preformed loops to form ligatures or needle 
sutures. However, when preformed loops are used for 
ligatures, they can only be applied to tissue appendages. 
They can not, for example, be tied around ducts between 
two organs. Preformed loops also have a tendency to lock 
prematurely, that is, before the ligature is finally 
cinched in place. Extracorporeal knot tying can produce 
lost insufflation and requires extra time that can extend 
the overall time for completing a surgical procedure. 
Transferring a knot from the exterior of the body to the 
suture site is subject to premature cinching of the knot 
and the knots are subject to breakage when very thin 
sutures are used. Intracorporeal knot tying has been 
difficult to master and is also very time consuming. The following patents disclose a number of apparatus 
that have been proposed for facilitating extracorporeal 
suture tying, namely US-A: 
3,580,256(1971) Wilkinson 4,961,741(1990)Hayhurst   4,957,498 (1990) Caspari et al  
 5,087,263(1992)Li 5,098,137(1992)Wardall The Wilkinson patent discloses apparatus that 
supports a suture in an overlapping loop formation so one 
end of a suture can be threaded through the loop to form a 
throw and when pulled tight, a knot. However, in the 
Wilkinson patent the suture loop must be encased in wax 
prior to the surgical procedure and a separate casing or 
structure must be formed independently for each knot. The Hayhurst patent discloses apparatus in which 
leading and trailing members guide a pair of suture knots, 
such as overhand knots, to a tissue surface. The first 
overhand knot is secured against the tissue as the second 
knot advances. The Caspari et al patent disclose a suturing 
instrument that enables an extracorporeally tied knot to 
be moved into the body. The apparatus uses a throw stick 
to advance a knot to the tissue through a cannula. The Li patent discloses a

<CLAIMS>
A device (20) for facilitating the tying of a suture at a distal, 
intracorporeal location by manipulation at a proximal location, comprising: 


A. elongate flexible means (22) formed of a shape memory 
material and formed with a bight (28) at the distal end; 
B. elongate sheath means (21) for overlying said flexible means (22) 
and being displaceable with respect to said flexible means (22) 

whereby displacement of said sheath means (21) to the distal end 
of said flexible means straightens said bight (28); and 
C. manipulation means (26, 27) for moving said flexible means (22) 
and said sheath means (21) relative to the distal location and to 

each other; 
 
   
characterised in that
 said flexible means (22) comprises flexible tube 
means for supporting a suture (25) between the proximal and distal locations, 

and proximal displacement of said sheath means (21) enables said flexible tube 
means (22) to reform said bight (28) with the bight (28) forming a loop in the 

suture (25). 
An intracorporeal knot tying device as claimed in claim 1, wherein 
said manipulation means comprises first (27) and second (26) manipulators at 

the proximal ends of said tube means (22) and of said sheath means (21) 
respectively. 
An intracorporeal knot tying device as claimed in claim 1 or 2, wherein 

said material is taken from a group of metals and metal alloys 
characterized by
 
having shape memory. 
An intracorporeal knot tying device as claimed in claim 1 or 2, wherein 
said material comprises a thermo-plastic material having shape memory.  

 
An intracorporeal knot tying device as claimed in any preceding claim, 
wherein said material comprises a composite having shape memory 

characteristics. 
An intracorporeal knit tying device as claimed in claim 5, wherein said 
material comprises a plastic and metal composite having shape memory 

characteristics. 
An intracorporeal knot tying device as claimed in any preceding claim, 
wherein said flexible tube means (22) has a predetermined length, and said 

sheath means (21) has a length that is less than said predetermined length.
