<ABSTRACT>
According to the invention, a printing machine (26) is provided, which has a forme cylinder (28, 29) which is exchangeable, together with its printing forme, for a forme cylinder (28', 29') of identical construction. In this case, the forme cylinders (28, 29; 28', 29') have permanently set interfaces for laterally and circumferentially correct in-register positioning inside the printing machine (26). The interchangeable unit has a gripper (34, 35) for exchanging the used forme cylinder (28, 29) for the other forme cylinder (28', 29'). This is taken from a storage magazine, e.g. drum storage (36) or chain storage. An imaging unit (37) is preferably present inside the storage magazine (36), in which unit the old printing image is firstly deleted and a new printing image is then applied, e.g. according to the ink jet or thermal transfer method. Instead of the forme cylinder (28, 29), other cylinders (30, 31, 32) or rollers can also be exchanged. The forme cylinder (28, 29) can also be covered by an interchangeable sleeve which forms the printing forme.

<CLAIMS>
Printing machine (16) having at least one forme 
cylinder (95) carrying a printing forme in the form of 

a sleeve (96) adhering in a force-fitting manner to its 
casing, the sleeve (96) of which forme cylinder can be 

exchanged by a replacement sleeve by removing it from 
the casing, the forme cylinder (95) being inserted in 

the printing machine (16) in a mounting (50), from 
which it can again be removed, characterised in that 

the forme cylinder (95) has fixedly predetermined 
interfaces or adapters for the accurate mounting (50) 

on the printing machine (16) with respect to lateral 
and peripheral register, the printing machine (16) has 

a removal device (90) for removing the forme cylinder 
(95) from its mounting (50), wherein in the removal 

device (90) for exchanging the sleeve (96) there is a 
holding means (92) for holding the forme cylinder (95) 

on one of its journals (520) whilst the other journal 
(520') is free, and wherein a sleeve-exchanging device 

removes the sleeve (96) from the forme cylinder (95) 
and exchanges it for the replacement sleeve. 
Printing machine (16) according to claim 1, 
characterised in that the removal device (90) has two 

gripper arms (92, 93) with which it pivots the forme 
cylinder (95) out of its mounting (50), it rotates the 

forme cylinder (95) about one of its transverse axes 
until it hangs perpendicularly on one of the gripper 

arms (92), and then the other gripper arm (93) is 
pivoted away from the forme cylinder (95) so that it 

hangs freely and its sleeve (96) can be removed in a 
downwards direction. 
Printing machine (16) according to claim 1 or 2,  
 

characterised in that the removal device (90) is 
arranged near, below or above the respective printing 

unit of the printing machine (16). 
Printing machine (16) according to one of claims 1 
to 3, characterised in that a delivery magazine with a 

drum store or a chain store is provided. 
Printing machine (16) according to claim 4, 
characterised in that the forme cylinders (95) 

mounted in the drum store or chain store are rotatable 
respectively about their own longitudinal axes and are 

cleaned by a cleaning device on their casing surface 
while the forme cylinders (95) rotate respectively 

about their longitudinal axes. 
Printing machine (16) according to one of claims 1 
to 5, characterised in that [there is]
 an imaging unit 
(14, 15; 25; 37; 48, 49) for re-imaging of the sleeve 

(96) of the forme cylinder (95), the latter being 
rotated about its longitudinal axis during imaging. 
Printing machine (16) according to claim 6, 
characterised in that the imaging unit has an erasure 

device for erasing the printed image of the sleeve (96) 
of the forme cylinder (95), and an imaging device for 

producing a new printed image on the sleeve (96) of the 
forme cylinder (95). 
Printing machine (16) according to claim 7, 
characterised in that the imaging unit additionally 

contains a fixing device for preserving the printed 
image on the sleeve (96). 
Printing machine (16) according to claim 8, 
characterised in that the imaging unit operates in  

 
accordance with the ink jet process, the laser ablation 

process or the thermal transfer process. 
Printing machine (16) according to one of the 
preceding claims, characterised in that the forme 

cylinder (95) has receiving means (51, 52) for the
