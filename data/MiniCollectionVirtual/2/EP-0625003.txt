<ABSTRACT>
Apparatus and methods for handling sod (15) and soil removal which includes a sod washing system or machine in which the water from nozzles on the spray bars (40) is recycled and the soil removed from the sod is delivered for reuse. The system also provides a cradle (14) with driven roller(s) to deliver and take up the rolls of sods (15) in a manner that the peripheral speed of the roll remains constant regardless of the roll diameter. The washing system also has various methods of physical working the sod by water nozzle sprays, brushes, conveyors, vibrators, compressed and/or pulsed air to remove soil therefrom; and methods of handling the sod by supporting it with a sheet of flexible mesh material where there is likely to be stress on the sod.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to sod handling and is particularly
applicable to sod washing systems but can also be applied to
harvesting and other processing of sod.The term sod in this specification, which is used in some
countries in the world, can be considered to be identical to
turf, which is used in other countries, and in each case is the
upper stratum of soil which contains the roots of grass and,
indeed, the processes which we will be describing have to do with
the harvesting and the handling of grasses and in particular to
grasses which are grown for this purpose.There is a recognised primary industry of sod growing and the sod
so grown is harvested by the use of a cutter blade which passes
through the sod at a predetermined depth to ensure that a
required quantity of the root mass is retained and two such
harvesting systems, which are purely exemplary, can be seen in
US Patent No 4944352 of Brouwer et al and US Patent No 5064000
of Dover et al.It is also known to take the sod so harvested and to remove from
the sod the soil, which may include sand and other organic matter
by a washing process and the original form of this process is
illustrated in US Patent No 4063384 of Warren et al.The present invention is not directed specifically to the
harvesting step but can provide, in one aspect, in association
with a harvester, means whereby some or all of the soil (and in
this specification we shall henceforth refer to soil to include
sand, humus and other organic or non-organic matter which is
enmeshed in the root mass) can be removed as part of the
harvesting step or separately therefrom.Whilst the Warren type process has been further developed by
Strathayr and now provides an end product which is satisfactory, 
it does have two ancillary aspects which
are less than satisfactory.The first of these is that it uses very substantial
quantities of water. This, of course, is not
desirable if water supplies are restricted and, even
where there is substantial water it can in itself
lead to difficulties.The wash water, after it has been used to remove soil,
can often have relatively high nutrient values and may
also have weed seeds or vegetative plant material and,
for these reasons, it may not be acceptable, or even
legal, to pass the waste water into natural water
courses as the nutrients and other foreign material
can be most undesirable. For example, nutrients can
feed blue/green algae and other undesirable organisms
and undesirable plants can be spread along the water
course.The second is that the water

<CLAIMS>
A sod washing system having an input conveyor
means (10), a horizontal washing station (11), and an

output conveyor means (12), the washing station
including means (13) to deliver water to the station,

nozzles (41) at the washing station connected to the
delivery means and facing downwardly to direct water

at sods passing through the washing station beneath
the nozzles to remove soil from the sods and a tank

(84) disposed below the washing station to collect
water/soil from the sods for subsequent separation;

   characterised in that the input conveyor means is
inclined and extends up to the horizontal washing

station, and the output conveyor means is declined and
extends down from the horizontal washing station;


in that a receiver (30) is provided at the
washing station to receive water and soil removed from

the sod, the receiver being connected to an inlet (70)
of the tank to deliver the water and soil to the

inlet;
in that the tank has two lower portions (75,76)
which are separated by a higher portion (77), outlets

(79,80) associated with each lower portion and a
baffle (78) extending from the top of the tank between

the inlet (70) and the first lower portion (75), so
that water passing into the inlet is caused to pass

beneath the baffle and tends to rise because of the
higher portion beyond the baffle, the arrangement

being such that the velocity of the water through the
tank changes and soil entrained in the water falls out

of suspension and due to the shape of the tank moves
towards the second outlet (80) in the second lower portion from whence it can be

removed from the tank, and
in that means (82) are provided for pumping water 
from the tank to the washing station nozzles.
A sod washing system as claimed in claim 1 ,
characterised in that the washing station (11) is

disposed above the tank (84) so that the water and
soil in the receiver pass to the tank by gravity.
A sod washing system as claimed in claim 1 or
claim 2, characterised in that humus and larger sized

solid materials are removed from the water before the
water and soil pass to the tank.
A sod washing system as claimed in any of the
preceding claims, characterised in that the washing

station (11) has a plurality of nozzles (41) located
above a conveyor (21) along which the sod to be washed

passes; and in that the station is shrouded to
minimise water waste.
A sod washing system as claimed in claim 4,
characterised in that at least the nozzle or nozzles

(41a) adjacent the output end of the conveyor are fed
from a water source (43) separate from the tank (84).
A sod washing system as claimed in claim 5,
characterised in that the water source (43) separate

from the tank initially obtains water from the tank
and includes means to treat the water to remove solid

and/or chemicals therefrom.
A sod washing system as claimed in either claim 5
or claim 6, characterised in that the water fed to the

nozzle or nozzles (41a) adjacent the output end is
chilled. 
A sod washing system as claimed in any of claims
1 to 7, characterised in that the conveyors (10, 12,

21) run at the same linear speed so that no stress is
placed on the sod as it passes between conveyors.
A sod washing system as claimed in any of the
preceding claims, characterised in that there is a

delivery or take up cradle (14) to deliver or receive
sod to or from the conveyor means.
A sod washing system as claimed in claim 9 for
handling sod in rolls including a number of rollers

(93 to 96) so located that the roll, no matter what
size is supported by some at least of the rollers and

means to drive at least one roller so that a sod can
be delivered from or taken up by the cradle at a

constant linear speed.
A sod washing system as claimed in claim 10,

characterised in that the rollers (93, 96) are each
driven at the same speed.
A sod washing system as claimed in claim 11,
characterised in that the rollers (93, 96) are driven

from a conveyor (10) to which or from which the
cradle is to deliver or receive sod so that regardless

of the conveyor speed, the peripheries of the cradle
rollers, and thus the sod moves at the linear speed of

the conveyor.
