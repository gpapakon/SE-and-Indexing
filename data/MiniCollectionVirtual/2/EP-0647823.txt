of fins (22) disposed on the peripheral surface of the pipe barrel (21) 

at least on either a heat collecting section side or a 
radiating section side, each of the fins is attached to the 

pipe barrel on a plane perpendicular to the axis of the pipe 
barrel, and each of the fins is composed of a metal plate (23) and 

net-like material (24) adhered to both surfaces of the metal plate (23). 
A heat exchanger (2) of gas-liquid contacting plate type 
includes: a plurality of heat transfer plates (4), disposed 

vertically at certain intervals, defining air flow passages (20) 
therebetween which allow air to rise, and each of the plates 

has a heat medium flowing passage (10) thereinside for allowing a 
heat medium to flow therethrough while the side surfaces of 

each of the heat transfer plates, which define the air flow 
passages, are adhered with nets (30) for allowing a liquid to flow 

downward along the nets and plates.

<DESCRIPTION>
(1) The present invention relates to a heat pipe (a first
configuration of the present invention) and gas-liquid
contacting apparatuses (second and third configurations of the
present invention) which are able to perform both gas-liquid
contact and heat exchange simultaneously by utilizing the heat
pipes. More specifically, the present invention relates to a
heat pipe with fins of certain surface structure and to gas-liquid
contacting apparatuses utilizing the heat pipes. The
gas-liquid contacting apparatus of the present invention is
able to perform both heat transfer (or exchange) and gas-liquid
contact at the same time, so that the apparatus lends itself to
applications to various fields of chemical engineering
processes.A heat pipe is able to perform heat transfer between a
heat collecting section (evaporation section or high-temperature
side) and a radiating section (condensation section
or low-temperature side) by utilizing the evaporation and
condensation of a heat transfer medium called as an operating
liquid which is confined inside the heat pipe. The heat pipe 
of this kind is capable of conveying a large amount of heat in
a short period of time despite that the temperature difference
between the two sides is very small, so that this device has
been used in various fields.Heat exchangers with heat pipes applied thereto may be
used for heating cold air by utilizing, for example, the heat
of exhaust gas. In this case, a large number of heat pipes 41
are put together, as sectionally shown in Fig.7, inside a case
44 in the form of panels. Provided on the peripheral surface
of each heat pipe 41 is fins 42 attached at close intervals so
as to enlarge the heat-transfer surface area. The case 44 is
parted vertically at an appropriate level by a partitioning
plate 43 so that air circulating passage for each air is
isolated from the other.The heat exchanger using the heat pipes is desirably
mounted in such a manner that axes of heat pipes are oriented
vertically as seen in Fig.7. But, even if the heat exchanger
is mounted so that the heat pipes are oriented horizontally as
perspectively shown in Fig.8, heat transfer inside the heat
pipes can be achieved. In the configuration shown in Fig.8,
the case is also separated in the middle into right and left
portions by means of the partitioning plate 43 so that air
circulating passage for each air is isolated from the other.In the heat exchanger utilizing the conventional heat
pipes, typically, two fluids, different in temperature, are 
brought into contact
