<ABSTRACT>
A circumferential flow path (86) is established about an axis of rotation, while the circumferential flow path (86) is rotated about the axis. Blood is introduced into the rotating circumferential flow path (86) through an inlet port (122) having an axis that is parallel to the axis of rotation. The axial inlet flow together with the circumferential separation flow creates a vortex region (148) that circulates about the port axis and stretches across the circumferential flow path (86). The vortex region (148) perfuses the blood uniformly into the circumferential flow path (86) for separation into constituent parts.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a centrifugal 
processing chamber and method. Today blood collection organizations 
routinely separate whole blood by centrifugation into 
its various therapeutic components, such as red blood 
cells, platelets, and plasma.  
 Conventional blood processing systems and 
methods use durable centrifuge equipment in 
association with single use, sterile processing 
chambers, typically made of plastic. The centrifuge 
equipment introduces whole blood into these chambers 
while rotating them to create a centrifugal field. Whole blood separates within the rotating 
chamber under the influence of the centrifugal field 
into higher density red blood cells and platelet-rich 
plasma. The platelet-rich plasma is then further 
separated into platelet concentrate and platelet-poor 
plasma. The invention provides, as set out in claims 1 and 4, an 
improved blood processing chamber and method that create unique 
dynamic flow conditions within the processing chamber. 
The dynamic flow conditions serve to maximize exposure 
of the blood components to the centrifugal separation 
forces, enhancing separation efficiencies. The pre-amble of claim 1 is based on US-A-4934995. The invention provides a processing chamber 
and associated method for separating blood components. 
The invention establishes a circumferential flow path 
about an axis of rotation, while rotating the 
circumferential flow path about the axis of rotation. 
The invention introduces blood into the rotating 
circumferential flow path through an inlet port having 
an axis that is parallel to the axis of rotation. The axial inlet flow coupled with the 
circumferential separation flow create a vortex region 
within the chamber. The vortex region circulates 
about the port axis and stretches across the 
circumferential flow path. The vortex region perfuses 
the blood uniformly into the circumferential flow path 
for separation into constituent parts.  
 Mention below of an axial flow chamber is not according to the invention, 
but has been included to aid understanding of the invention, which relates 
to a circumferential flow chamber.

yield axial flow processing chamber, not according to the 
invention; Fig. 2 is a diagrammatic view of the chamber 
shown in Fig. 1 operating in a centrifugation field; Fig. 3 is a diagrammatic view of the 
interior of the chamber shown in Fig. 1 when

<CLAIMS>
A chamber (84,86) for rotation about an axis to separate a blood substance 
into its components comprising: 


a low-G side wall (64) radially spaced from the axis, a high-G side 
wall (66) radially spaced from the axis farther than the low-G side wall, 

end walls spaced apart circumferentially about the axis so that a separation 
zone is formed, 
means (68,122,138) including an inlet (68,138) for introducing the 
blood substance into the separation zone along a path that extends generally parallel 

to the axis of rotation, 
means (122,142) for conveying the blood substance that is introduced into the 
separation zone along a path that extends generally circumferentially about 

the axis of rotation for separation into its component parts, 
 
   wherein the inlet (68,138) opens into the separation zone above the 

bottom thereof, so that in use, a non turbulent vortex region (148) is produced that 
stretches from the inlet, longitudinally across the circumferential flow path 

of the chamber,
 
   characterised by a collection passage (126,146) for receiving a 

blood component that is separated in the separation zone, the collection 
passage (126,146) being axially spaced below the bottom of the separation 

zone and including an entrance circumferentially spaced from the inlet 
(68,138) and at the bottom of the separation zone for conveying the 

separated blood component from the separation zone and into the 
collection passage (126,146), wherein a second non turbulent vortex region (148) is 

produced, circumferentially spaced from the first vortex region (148), that 
stretches from the entrance to the collection passage (126), longitudinally 

across the circumferential flow path, the vortex regions (148) being 
aligned with the axis of rotation and having the same direction towards the bottom 

of the separation zone.  
 
The chamber of Claim 1, wherein the inlet (138) opens into the top 
of the separation zone. 
The chamber according to Claim 1 or 2 including means (124,126) 
for conveying at least one of the separated component parts from the 

separation zone along a path that extends generally parallel to the axis of 
rotation. 
A method for separating blood components using the chamber of 
any preceding claim, wherein the circumferential flow path is rotated 

while blood is introduced through the inlet into the separation zone along 
the or the first flow path that is parallel to the axis of rotation to create a 

vortex region that circulates about the inlet (68,138) axis and stretches 
across the circumferential flow path and that perfuses the blood uniformly 

into the circumferential flow path for separation into constituent parts.
