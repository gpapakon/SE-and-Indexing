<ABSTRACT>
The invention refers to a machine to form a sling with a wire loop (27) at the end of the wire (8) and with a clamping sleeve (2) serving as a wire lock for the loop (27). In the machine feed wheels (7) are included for feeding in the wire (8) at one side of a press device (5), through a clamping sleeve (2) introduced in the press device (5) and out at the opposite side of the press device (5). Further an elongated duct (10) is contained in the machine, situated on the output side of the press device (5), which duct is provided to guide the front end portion (13) of the wire (8) in the feeding direction during the continued feed of the feed wheels (7) of the wire (8). In front of the duct (10) outlet port a clamping device (14) is situated, which is arranged to seize the wire (8) a paragraph behind its front portion and by means of a revolving means (15) revolve round the end portion of the wire (13) substantially half a turn for formation of a wire loop (27) as well as lead back the same against the press device (5) as far, that the end portion of the wire penetrates through the clamping sleeve (2) in the main parallel to the portion of the wire (8) extending through the clamping sleeve (2). A first indicating device (29) is arranged to detect correct feeding position for the end portion of the wire in the clamping sleeve (2) after the formation of the wire loop (27) and to give signal to reversing of the wire feeding. A second indicating device (31) is arranged to detect correct calculated size of the wire loop (27) and subsequently give signal to the press device (5) for pressing of the clamping sleeve (2).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention refers to a machine to form a sling, 
that consists of a wire, the end portions of which each 
forms a loop and with its outer end portions is held each 
in a clamping sleeve applied on the wire. Different types of machines have been developed to form 
such slings, which are used for different purposes within 
the load handling. Such a machine is known through the 
Swedish patent application SE-A-8902250-3, 
corresponding to publication SE-B-464044, published 25 Febr. 1991. Through the invention a machine has been developed, that 
constitutes a further development of the prior art and 
that exhibits advantages compared with earlier known 
techniques. The characterizing features of this machine 
will be illustrated by the following claims. The invention will now be closer described with reference 
to the enclosed drawings, in which fig. 1 discloses the 
machine perspectively at an angle from the side, fig. 2 
discloses perspectively at an angle from the top and at an 
enlarged scale substantial parts included in the machine 
in one position and in fig. 3 is shown the same view with 
the parts of the machine in another position and fig. 4-7 
disclose different sequences of the wire feed. In the machine a sleeve magazine 1 with a number of 
clamping sleeves 2 and a feeding mechanism 4 actuated by a 
piston cylinder 3 are included for loading these clamping 
sleeves 2 provided in a press device 5. On the input side of the press device 5 is provided a 
guide flap 6, that is pivotable upwards-downwards. Outside 
the guide flap 6 are provided four feed rollers 7, between 
which a wire 8 is feedable, which wire is arranged on a 
table 9 serving as a bed.  
 On the opposite side of the press device 5, the output 
side, a duct 10 is provided, which consists of two parts 
10a and 10b. The part 10a, located nearest the output side 
of the press device 5, can be swung away in the manner 
shown in fig. 3. This part 10a of the duct 10 has a hinged 
lateral wall 11 which can be opened. The other part 10b of 
the duct 10 is stationary and provided with an upper part 
12 which can be folded up. The duct 10 is intended to 
guide the front end portion 13 of the wire 8 during the 
feed of the wire through the press device 5. In front of 
the outlet port of the drum 10 is provided a clamping 
device 14, that is arranged to grip the wire 8 at some 
distance behind its front end. The clamping device 14 
preferably is constituted by a hydraulic driven tightening 
cylinder. The clamping device 14 is rigidly
