A brewing device (1) for a household espresso coffee 
machine including a piston (25), vertically slidable in a 

housing part (19), and a filter basket (29) to be filled 

with ground coffee (39) which is retained in a 
horizontally movable filter basket holder (2) and which, 

when the piston (25) is lowered and reaches into the 
filter basket (29) (working position), forms with it a 

pressure chamber (40) in which the ground coffee (39) is 
enclosed, and into which, on the piston side, hot water 

under pressure is urged through a conduit (20), and from 
which, on the filter basket holder side, the prepared 

espresso coffee beverage is discharged through at least 
one outlet opening (38),
characterised
 in that the filter basket 
holder (2) with the filter basket (29), when the piston 

(25) is lifted, can be swung about a vertically extending 
tilting axis (4) out of the range of effect of the piston 

(25), in that the tilting range of the filter basket 
holder (2) reaches from its working position to its feed 

position in which the filter basket (29) is accessible 
from the outside, and in that the filter basket holder 

(2), in its working position only, is secured with respect 
to the housing part (19) against movement in a vertical 

direction by supporting elements (43, 42) provided on both 
the filter basket holder (2) and the housing part (19). 
A brewing device as claimed in claim 1,
characterised
 in that the position of the 
tilting axis (4) is determined by two points of support 

(31) which are provided on the housing part (19) and are 
disposed outside the range of effect of the piston (25). 
A brewing device as claimed in claim 1,
characterised
 in that the supporting elements 
(42, 43) are arranged at the housing part (19) and the  

 
filter basket holder (2), spread around the pressure 

chamber (40). 
A brewing device as claimed in claim 3,
characterised
 in that those supporting 
elements (43, 42) which are disposed on top of the 

sectional plane (A-A) of filter basket holder (2) and 
housing part (19), when the filter basket holder (2) is 

swung into the housing part, are arranged in the closing 
direction (Y) in the front area (49), and in that those 

supporting elements (43, 42) which are disposed below the 
partition plane (55) of filter basket holder (2) and 

housing part (19), when the filter basket holder (2) is 
swung into the housing part, are arranged in the closing 

direction (Y) in the rear area (50). 
A brewing device as claimed in claim 4,
characterised
 in that the supporting elements 
(43, 42) extend substantially concentrically in relation 

to the tilting axis (4). 
A brewing device as claimed in claim 5,
characterised
 in that the supporting elements 
(42, 43) extend in parallel to the sectional plane (A-A), 

and in that they are provided with reinforcing ribs (45, 
46) which extend transversely to the sectional plane (A-A). 
A brewing device as claimed in claim 2,
characterised
 in that the filter basket 
holder (2) is furnished with a pivot pin (28), the ends of 

which can be hung into the mounting lugs arranged at the 
housing part (19), whereby it is secured against movement 

in a vertical direction.  
 
A brewing device as claimed in claim 1,
characterised
 in that the piston (25) is 
provided with a press-on arrangement (3) which is slidable 

in opposition to the effect of a displacement force and is 
guided in the housing part (19). 
A brewing device as claimed in claim 8,
characterised
 in that the press-on 
arrangement (3) of the filter basket holder (2) is 

slidably accommodated, in opposition to the effect of a 
spring (9), in a guide (6) of the housing part (19) 

extending upwardly in the direction of motion of the 
piston (25). 
A brewing device as claimed in claim 9,
characterised
 in that the guide (6) for the 
slidable accommodation of the press-on arrangement (3) of 

the filter basket holder (2) is a cylindrical bore (7), 
which is provided in the stationary housing part (18) of 

the espresso coffee machine. 
A brewing device as claimed in claim 10,
characterised
 in that the guide (6) forming 
the bore (7) extends in parallel to the tilting axis (4) 

of the housing part (19). 
A brewing device as claimed in claim 11,
characterised
 in that the press-on 
arrangement (3) with the associated piston (25) can be 

moved to adopt automatically a locking position by 
displacing the press-on arrangement (3) at least in a 

position in which the ground espresso coffee (39) is 
compressed.  

 
A brewing device as claimed in claim 8,
characterised
 in that the spring (9) of the 
press-on arrangement (3) is mounted on a pin (8), 

incorporated slidably in the bore (7) and attached to the 
press-on arrangement (3), and, with its one end, moves 

into abutment with a handle (12) furnished at the pin (8) 
and, with its other end, moves into abutment with the 

upper side (11) of the injection tip (13) provided in the 
housing part (19). 
A brewing device as claimed in claim 13,
characterised
 in that a locking lever (14) is 
provided at the housing part (19) which extends 

transversely to the pin (8) and is swivellable about a 
supporting surface (51), in that the locking lever (14), 

by way of a fitting bore (52), tightly encloses the pin 
(8) and forms a friction-type lock with it, so that the 

pin (8) is freely adjustable when the locking lever (14) 
is depressed into an unlocking position and, when the 

adjusting pressure is removed to cause a locking position, 
the pin (8) is undisplaceably coupled to the housing part 

(19) by the locking lever (14). 
A brewing device as claimed in claim 14,
characterised
 in that the effect of a 
compression spring (16) constantly keeps the locking lever 

(14) in its locking position, in which the pin (8) is held 
to be undisplaceable. 
A brewing device as claimed in claim 1,
characterised
 in that the piston (25) 
includes a jet (20), which is open towards the pressure 

chamber (40), and which is connected with a supply device, 
subjecting the hot water to pressure, through a conduit 

provided between the piston (25) and the housing part 
(11).  

 
A brewing device as claimed in claim 1,
characterised
 in that the piston (25), for 
its displacement, is provided with a press-on arrangement 

which is composed of a threaded arrangement provided at 
the housing part (19) and the piston (25). 
A brewing device as claimed in claim 1,
characterised
 in that a handle (62) is 
provided at the filter basket (29) so as to project 

radially therefrom.
