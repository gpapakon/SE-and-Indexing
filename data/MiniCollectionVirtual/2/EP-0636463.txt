<ABSTRACT>
A method of producing a sandwich plate that consists of a foamed 
core layer and two fiber-reinforced cover layers, comprising the steps 

of
 

   providing a sheet of a thermoplastic plastics material, such as 
polyetherimide, containing an amount of a suitable solvent or blowing 

agent;
 

   placing said sheet between two fiber-reinforced layers of a 
similar thermoplastic material, such as polyetherimide; placing the 

core web and cover layer assembly between two pressure plates;
 

   supplying heat and pressure to the pressure plates to cause 
foaming of the core web and

 
   cooling the pressure plates when a predetermined foam layer 

thickness is obtained. 
According to one aspect of the invention one of the cover layers 
has a remaining percentage of solvent that does not exceed 0,1% of 

weight. 
According to a second aspect of the invention the thermoplastic 
material in at least one of the cover layers is a modification 

having a higher chemical resistance than the thermoplastic material of 
the core layer.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a method of producing a sandwich plate
that consists of a foamed core layer and two fiber-reinforced cover
layers, comprising the steps of
providing a sheet of a thermoplastic plastics material, such as
polyetherimide, containing an amount of a suitable solvent or blowing
agent;placing said sheet between two fiber-reinforced layers of a
similar thermoplastic material, such as polyetherimide; placing the
core web and cover layer assembly between two pressure plates;supplying heat and pressure to the pressure plates to cause
foaming of the core web andcooling the pressure plates when a predetermined foam layer
thickness is obtained.Examples of a thermoplastic sandwich plate consisting of a
foamed core layer and two fiber-reinforced cover layers are disclosed
e.g. in EP 0264495 and EP 0313171. Such sandwich plates are e.g.
suitable starting material for shaping (interior) parts for aircrafts,
spacecrafts and ships, as well as for rail and road vehicles. For
sandwich plates of this type are relatively easily mouldable under
pressure and heat (vide also EP 0269148) and result in relatively
light-weight parts having excellent strength properties, which is of
particular importance in the aircraft and spacecraft field. Furthermore
the selection of a specific thermoplastic material, such as
polyetherimide, leads to good fire resisting or fire retarding
properties.In the above prior art documents various methods are described
for producing such sandwich plates. According to a method that is
described in more detail, a completed foam core layer (such as a
polyetherimide foam layer) is assembled with two completed cover
layers (e.g. consisting of a polyetherimide impregnated fabric of
aramide fibers), while supplying heat and pressure. To improve the
bond between core and cover layers it is proposed to provide the foam
core layer with shallow grooves and to apply a web of a thermoplastic
material (polyetherimide), which may have been pretreated by a
solvent, between the grooved foam layer and the cover layers.As an alternative the possibility of a production in situ is
mentioned EP 0313171. This alternative method, which is actually used
in practice, involves a method as defined herein above. As soon as the 
core web and cover layer assembly has reached a uniform temperature
that is required for foaming of the plastic material, the pressure
plates are permitted to space apart in accordance with a certain
foaming curve that is determined by the type of plastic material, the
solvent and the

A method of producing a sandwich plate that consists of a foamed

providing a sheet of a thermoplastic plastics material, such as

agent;
placing said sheet between two fiber-reinforced layers of a similar
thermoplastic material, such as polyetherimide;
placing the core web and cover layer assembly between two pressure
plates;
supplying heat and pressure to the pressure plates to cause foaming
of the core web and effect bonding between the foamed core and the cover

layers by diffusion from solvent from the core layers into the cover
layers;
cooling the pressure plates when a predetermined foam layer
thickness is obtained,

characterized in that one of the cover layers has a remaining
percentage of solvent that does not exceed 0,1 % of weight.
A method according to claim 1, characterized in that the thermoplastic
material in at least one of the cover layers is a modification 

having a higher chemical resistance than the thermoplastic material of
the core layer.
