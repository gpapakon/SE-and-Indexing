<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates generally to portable 
rescue tools of the type used at an emergency scene 
such as an accident or a fire. More particularly, 
the invention relates to a portable rescue tool that 
is fluid powered and capable of applying a high 
magnitude force to perform a rescue operation. Typical of the portable rescue tools to which 
the invention relates are the rescue tools 
manufactured by Hurst Emergency Products division of 
Hale Products, Inc. including, for example, cutting 
tools, spreading tools, rams, and the like. 
Presently, the rescue tools of the indicated type 
are provided as part of a system which includes a 
power unit for providing hydraulic power for 
operating the tools, there being provided gasoline,  
 
diesel, electric, and pneumatic power units. These 
power units are incorporated as a separate portable 
unit and include a positive displacement hydraulic 
pump. The portable rescue tool is also made as a 
separate unit and is connected to the hydraulic pump 
of the power unit by means of two hydraulic lines, 
namely, a supply line and a return line. The rescue 
tools are commonly provided with a manually operable 
control valve for controlling the flow of the 
hydraulic fluid from the pump in a manner to control 
operation of the rescue tool mechanism. While the above-described rescue systems 
including a separate portable power unit and 
portable rescue tool are very satisfactory in most 
applications, they do limit the freedom of movement 
of the tool operator by reason of the use of the two 
hydraulic hose lines which extend between the power 
unit and the portable rescue tool carried by the 
tool operator as he performs the rescue operation. It is the general object of the present 
invention to provide a rescue tool of the indicated 
type which is self-contained in that both the tool 
operating mechanism and the hydraulic power means 
for operating the same are incorporated into a 
single portable structure. This object is achieved  
 
by the features specified in claim 1. Other features of the invention include the 
following: 
(1) There is provided a convenient three 
position air operated "rocker switch" type of valve 
for controlling operation of the tool. (2) The tool is constructed to be light in 
weight and easily carried by a single person.  
 (3) The tool is designed to operate off of any 
compressed air source, such as SCBA bottles, air 
compressors, cascade systems, or the like.  (4) The tool can be adapted to operate off of 
any compressed inert gas,
