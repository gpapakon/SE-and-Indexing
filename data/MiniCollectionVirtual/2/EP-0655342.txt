<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a stamp device, and
particularly to a stamp device including a stamp member
having a print face portion that is formed of a heat
sensitive stencil paper.There has been utilized various
kinds of stamps each of which serves to print a company
name, an address or other character arrays on the surface
of a sheet and has a print face portion formed of rubber.Usually, this type of stamp is individually made
to order. Hence, they are expensive and a user must wait
for a long time to receive them from an order.On the other hand, a heat sensitive stencil paper
has been used for printing in which a
desired pattern can be perforated by irradiation of
infrared rays or a thermal head, and ink is transmitted
through a perforation array to print various kinds of
patterns of character arrays, figures, marks or the like.In U.S. Patent No. 5,285,725, the applicant of the
present application proposed a stencil plate that mainly
contains a heat sensitive stencil paper as described above
and an impregnation member impregnated with ink. The
stencil plate is suitable to prepare a stamp in place of
the conventional stamp having the print face portion
formed of rubber as described above.The stencil plate is formed as follows. An
impregnation member impregnated with ink and a frame
member surrounding the impregnation member are adhesively
attached to a synthetic resin film, and a heat sensitive
stencil paper is adhesively attached onto the surfaces of
the impregnation member and the frame member.When the stencil plate as described above is
applied to a stamp, the stencil plate is adhesively
attached to the lower surface of the base portion of a 
stamp member having a grip portion through a cushion
member, and a desired pattern of a character array or the
like is perforated on a heat sensitive paper by
irradiation of infrared rays or a thermal head. With this
construction, a stamp that comprises a stamp member and a
stencil plate and can print the desired character-array
pattern or the like on sheets over many times can be
obtained.In U.S. Patent No. 5,253,581, the applicant of the
present application proposed a stamp device comprising a
stamp member and a thermal perforating device for
perforating the print face portion of the stamp member.The stamp member comprises a grip portion, a body
case, a supply reel and a take-up reel that are
accommodated in the body case and serve to supply and wind
a tape-shaped heat sensitive stencil paper, and an ink pad
for supplying ink to perforated portions of the
