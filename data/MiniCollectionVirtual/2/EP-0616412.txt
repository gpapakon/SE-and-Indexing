<ABSTRACT>
An electromechanical transducer is formed by a first 
member (132) electromagnetically coupled to at least a 

portion of a second member (131), the first member and the 

second member being relatively slidable along a path having 
spaced end points. The first member (132) has a plurality 

of substantially contiguous windings (144) each for 
producing a magnetic field having a significant component 

orthogonal to the path and penetrating the second member. 
The second member includes at least one element (142) for 

interacting with the magnetic field and the first and 
second members are substantially symmetrical about a 

surface parallel to the path. The second member has a 
plurality of substantially contiguous permanent magnets of 

alternate polarity along the path, for establishing a 
magnetic field that reacts with the first member magnetic 

field to produce force along the path.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates in general to 
electromechanical transducing along a path and more 
particularly concerns an along-path controllable transducer 
for actively absorbing energy from a vehicle wheel assembly 
moving over a rough surface so as to facilitate 
significantly reducing forces transmitted to the vehicle 
body supported on the wheel assembly. Conventional vehicle suspensions employ a spring and 
shock absorber to isolate wheel motion from body motion. 
Advances have been made in suspensions by making 
suspensions variable and adaptive to driving conditions. 
For example, it is known to use electrically controlled 
active suspension members, such as a hydraulic piston 
actuator containing gas or fluid whose pressure may be 
electrically controlled, to achieve a predetermined 
characteristic, such as a hard or soft ride, while avoiding 
bottoming. A typical active control system uses wheel forces, car 
accelerations, or other vehicle parameters to determine 
when to open/close valves which allow fluid to flow, 
thereby moving the piston of the actuator in such a manner 
as to absorb shock. The article "Active Suspensions with Vibration 
Absorbers and Optimal Output Feedback Control" by A.G. 
Thompson et al, SAE Transactions paper no. 841253, 1985, 
New York discloses an active suspension using an 
electrohydraulic transducer. DE-A-2654075 and DE-A-3031781 disclose details of 
linear motors. FR-A-1418751 discloses an active vehicle 
suspension in which a "voice-coil" type motor is used as an 
along-path controllable electromechanical transducer for 
providing a controllable force between a sprung and an 
unsprung mass; and having a suspension interconnecting the 
sprung and unsprung masses; a source of a control signal;  
 
and a controller which controls the transducer in response 
to the control signal. According to the present invention, there is provided 
an electromechanical transducer comprising:
 
   a first member electromagnetically coupled to at least 
a portion of a second member, the first member and the 
second member being relatively slidable along a path having 
spaced end points;
 
   the first member having a plurality of substantially 
contiguous windings each for producing a magnetic field 
having a significant component orthogonal to the path and 
penetrating the second member;
 
   the second member including at least one element for 
interacting with the magnetic field;
 
   the first and second members being substantially 
symmetrical about a surface parallel to
