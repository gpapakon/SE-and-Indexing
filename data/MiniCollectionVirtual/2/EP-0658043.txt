<ABSTRACT>
A gradation output 
adjusting method wherein a gradation correcting section 64 corrects 

a gradation value of input data in accordance with a 
predetermined gradation correcting curve and applies the data 

after the correction to a printer output section 66. In 
preparing a gradation correcting curve, test data for forming 

a gradation scale is inputted to the printer output section 66 
from a CPU 70. An image corresponding to the test data is 

read by a scanner section 1. A proper gradation value to be 
applied to the printer output section 66 is found with respect 

to some gradation values of the input data on the basis of the 
result of the reading. A pre-gradation correcting curve is 

prepared on the basis of the proper gradation value. The pre-gradation 
correcting curve and a plurality of types of curve 

patterns previously stored in a ROM 72 are matched. A curve 

pattern which is best matched to the pre-gradation correcting 
curve is set as a detailed gradation correcting curve. Since 

the pre-gradation correcting curve and the curve pattern are 
matched to set the gradation correcting curve, therefore, the 

amount of operation may be small and processing time is 
reduced.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an image forming
apparatus comprising image reading means for reading an image
to output data each represented by gradation values and image
forming means for forming an image on the basis of the data
each represented by gradation values, and a gradation output
adjusting method which is applied to the image forming
apparatus.A color copying machine so adapted as to optically read a
color document by a CCD (Charge Coupled Device) scanner or the
like to convert the color document into signals representing
the three primary colors (additive), red (R), green (G) and
blue (B) and form a color image on the basis of the signals
has been conventionally used. The signals representing the
three primary colors R, G and B which are outputted from the
scanner are converted into data corresponding to the three
primary colors (subtractive), cyan (C), magenta (M) and yellow
(Y) which are the additive complementary colors of red, green
and blue. Each of the data corresponding to the three primary
colors C, M and Y is 8-bit data represented by 256 gradation
values, for example. The data corresponding to the three 
primary colors are subjected to suitable correction, and data
corresponding to black (BK) is further produced on the basis
of the data after the correction.For example, the surface of a photoreceptor is scanned by
a laser beam which is subjected to modulation based on the C
data, to form an electrostatic latent image corresponding to
cyan on the surface of the photoreceptor. The electrostatic
latent image is developed into a toner image using cyan toner
particles, and the cyan toner image is transferred onto copy
paper. In the same manner, toner images in the respective
colors, that is, magenta, yellow and black are transferred
onto the copy paper on which the cyan toner image have been
transferred one over the other with respect to the M data, the
Y data and the BK data. Finally, the toner particles are
heated and fixed to the copy paper, to achieve color copying.In terms of the property of the copying machine, a
document and a copy image can be easily compared with each
other, whereby a demand for the reproducibility of the
document is rigid. However, development characteristics and
sensitivity characteristics of a photoreceptor differ among a
plurality of copying machines, and the characteristics are
affected by the use environment of the copying machine.
Further, the development characteristics also differ based on
cyan, magenta, yellow and black. In order to faithfully
