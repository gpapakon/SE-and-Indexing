<ABSTRACT>
Device for tensioning a track in a motor vehicle, comprising a rotary jack mounted inside the body of the vehicle, the cylinder (34) of which jack can move and is rotationally secured to a crank shaft (24) on which the pulley (54) for tensioning the track (56) is mounted, it being possible for the driver of the vehicle to adjust this tension from the driver's seat of the vehicle. The invention applies particularly to armoured vehicles for military use and to civil engineering work vehicles.

A track tensioning device for an automotive 
vehicle, such as in particular an armoured vehicle or 

plant for engineering works, this device comprising a 
guiding pulley (54) for the track (56), a crankshaft (24) 

to support the pulley, means using a hydraulic jack to 
drive this shaft in rotation, and supply and control means 

for the jack, characterised in that the hydraulic jack is 
a revolving jack comprising two element (32, 44) 

respectively forming a cylinder and piston, one of which 
is attached to the vehicle body and the other is able to 

rotate around the rotational axis (30) of the shaft (24) 
supporting the pulley and is integral in rotation with 

this shaft, the latter being itself supported and guided 
in rotation par the fixed element (10, 44) of the 

revolving jack. 
A device according to Claim 1, characterised in 
that the cylinder (34) and the piston (44) of the 

revolving jack are of a toric shape. 
A device according to Claim 1 or 2, 
characterised in that the cylinder (34) of the jack is 

integral with the shaft (24) supporting the pulley whereas 
the piston (44) of the jack is fixed and is formed in a 

single piece with an attachment casing (10) on the body 
(14) of the vehicle. 
A device according to Claim 3, characterised in 
that the mobile element (32) of the jack comprises a first 

hollow toric part (34) to accommodate the piston (44) and 
a tubular cylindrical second part (36) through which the 

shaft (24) supporting the pulley passes. 
A device according to Claim 4, characterised in 
that the inner cylindrical surface of the second part (36) 

of the mobile element of the jack comprises longitudinal 
ribs (38) engaged in longitudinal ribs (40) formed on the 

outer cylindrical surface of the shaft (24) supporting the 
pulley.  

 
A device according to one of Claims 3 to 5, 
characterised in that the casing (10) of the revolving 

jack comprises two axially aligned sleeves (16, 18), 
arranged on either side of the piston (44) and in which 

bearings (20, 22) are mounted to support and guide the 
shaft (24) carrying the pulley. 
A device according to one of Claims 3 to 6, 
characterised in that the casing (10) of the jack is 

attached on the body on the inside of the latter, at an 
opening (26) through which the shaft (24) carrying the 

pulley passes. 
A device according to one of Claims 3 to 7, 
characterised in that a supply channel (46) in liquid 

under pressure passes longitudinally through the piston 
(44) of the jack. 
A device according to Claim 8, characterised in 
that the piston (44) of the jack comprises housings (50) 

connected to the supply channel (46) and accommodating the 
hydraulic components which are constituted by a pressure 

relief valve, a distributor and a pressure sensor, or by 
the connector elements joined to these components. 
A device according to one of the above Claims, 
characterised in that the supply and control means of the 

jack comprise a hydraulic pump (62) whose outlet is 
connected to the jack by means of a hydraulic circuit (64) 

incorporating a distributor and a pressure relief valve, 
one inlet (70) of the circuit (64) being connected to an 

outlet (72) of a logic circuit (74) whose inlets are 
connected to a pressure sensor (80) sensitive to the 

internal pressure of the jack, to a position sensor (82) 
sensitive to the angular position of the mobile element of 

the jack or of the shaft (24) supporting the pulley and to 
control means (76) which can be activated by the vehicle's 

driver.
