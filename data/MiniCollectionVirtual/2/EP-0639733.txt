<ABSTRACT>
A hydraulic control circuit for a hydraulically 
operated vehicular transmission (1) has at least five 

forward transmission trains (G1 - G5). The hydraulic 
control circuit is made up of three sets of first through 

third solenoid valves (17₁, 17₂, 17₃) and three sets of 
first through third shift valves (10, 11, 12) to be 

controlled for changeover by the three sets of solenoid 
valves (17₁, 17₂, 17₃) such that each of the transmission 

trains is established by changeover combinations of each 
of the shift valves (10, 11, 12). The first shift valve 

(10) controls a condition of communication between an oil 
supply passage (L1, L3) which is in communication with a 

hydraulic oil pressure source (7) and a first oil passage 
(L8) and a second oil passage (L11) which are both on a 

downstream side of the oil supply passage (L1, L3). The 
second shift valve (11) controls a condition of 

communication between the first oil passage (L8) and a 
third oil passage (L10) which is on a downstream side of 

the first oil passage (L8) and also controls a condition 
of communication between the second oil passage (L11) and 

a fourth oil passage (L12) and a fifth oil passage (L13,  
 

L14) which are both on a downstream side of the second oil 
passage (L11). The third shift valve (12) controls a 

condition of communication between the fifth oil passage 
(L13, L14) and a sixth oil passage (L15) and a seventh oil 

passage (L16) which are both on a downstream side of the 
fifth oil passage (L13, L14).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a hydraulic control 
circuit for a hydraulically operated vehicular 
transmission having at least five forward transmission 
trains. A hydraulically operated vehicular transmission is 
so arranged that, by using a plurality of hydraulic 
engaging elements (clutches and brakes), the supply of 
hydraulic oil to, and discharge thereof from, these 
hydraulic engaging elements are controlled by a plurality 
of shift valves so as to establish each of the 
transmission trains. In this case, there are provided 
shift valves that are smaller in number by one than the 
number of transmission trains. For example, in the case 
of five transmission trains, four shift valves are 
provided, i.e., 1-2 shift valve, 2-3 shift valve, 3-4 
shift valve and 4-5 shift valve. These shift valves are 
respectively made to be capable of being changed over 
between the two positions of a low-speed side and a high-speed  
 
side. At the low-speed position of each shift 
valve, a hydraulic engaging element for the transmission 
train to be taken care of by each of the shift valveS is 
connected to an oil passage which is communicated with an 
oil passage on an upstream side of the shift valve. At 
the high-speed position of each shift valve, the oil 
passage on the upstream side thereof is connected to an 
oil passage that is communicated with a shift valve on the 
downstream side. In this arrangement, when the 1-2 shift 
valve is at the low-speed position, the first-speed 
transmission train is established, when the 1-2 shift 
valve is at the high-speed position and the 2-3 shift 
valve is at the low-speed position, the second-speed 
transmission train is established, when the 1-2 shift 
valve and the 2-3 shift valve are at the high-speed 
position and the 3-4 shift valve is at the low-speed 
position, the third-speed transmission train is 
established, when the 1-2 shift valve, the 2-3 shift valve 
and the 3-4 shift valve are at the high-speed position and 
the 4-5 shift valve is at the low-speed position, the 
fourth-speed transmission train is established, and when 
all of the shift valves are at the high-speed position, 
the fifth-speed transmission train is established. In order to effect an automatic transmission or 
speed-changing by using an electronic control circuit such 
as a microcomputer or the like, there is conventionally  
 
known a transmission in which the shift valves are 
controlled for changeover by solenoid valves to be opened 
or closed by the electronic control circuit. In
