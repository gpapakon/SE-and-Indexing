<ABSTRACT>
A wheelchair comprises a main frame (10) carrying 
front wheels (18), a battery pack (22), and a foot rest 

assembly (32, 34). The wheelchair is driven by means of a 
pair of rear wheel units each comprising a drive motor (24) 

and a rear wheel (20) mounted on a sub frame (42). Each 
rear wheel unit is removable, as a unit, by releasing 

fastenings (42,46) which secure the sub frame to rearwardly 
projecting extensions (66,68) of the wheelchair main frame. 

Preferably, kerb climbers are mounted on the foot rest 
assembly whereby the kerb climbers and foot rest assembly 

can be removed from the main frame as a unit. The kerb 
climbers are preferably pivotally mounted on the support 

members (34) and may be located either in a use 
configuration or in a storage configuration in which the 

kerb climbers do not extend forwardly beyond the pivotal 
connections with the support members (34).

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to wheelchairs and more particularly to power
driven unitary wheelchairs.It is well known to provide power driven wheelchairs with arms, foot
rests and a battery pack which can be removed from the main frame of the
chair. However, the remaining main frame with the wheels and the motors is
still a very heavy and bulky single item for lifting, transportation and storage.In DE 2729267, there is disclosed a power driven wheelchair
comprising left and right drive wheel assemblies and a battery pack that are
manually removable, however the wheel units are mounted simultaneously
and have to be placed facing upwards so that the wheelchair frame is lowered
onto the wheel units and then the whole arrangement is rotated through 90Â°
so that the wheel units can be fastened thereto. The whole procedure is
cumbersome and unwieldy.According to one aspect of the present invention there is provided a
wheelchair comprising a main frame having two front wheels, a battery pack
and a drive unit, comprising two rear wheel units, each rear wheel unit being
individually removably mountable on the main frame by means of quick
release fastener means, and being releasably connectable to the battery
pack.Preferably, each rear wheel unit is provided with a drive motor.In a preferred embodiment, the frame incorporates longitudinal support
members which extend horizontally when the chair is in the use position, each
rear wheel unit being mountable on at least one support member by means of 
mutual insertion in the direction of extension of the at least one support
member.In a particularly preferred embodiment, each rear wheel unit is
mounted on two support members, the two members being vertically spaced
apart when the chair is in the use position. Each rear wheel unit may be
releasably mountable on one of the two support members by means of a
spring-loaded catch.Each rear wheel unit may be mounted on the other of the two support
members by means of a screw connection.Preferably the spring-loaded catch is provided on the upper of the two
support members.In a particularly preferred embodiment the main frame is additionally
provided with removably mountable back, seat, arms and foot rests.According to another aspect of the present invention there is provided
a wheelchair comprising a number of components including a main frame
having two front wheels, a battery pack, and two rear wheel units, each rear
wheel unit being provided with a drive motor, wherein said components are
detachable for dismantling the

<CLAIMS>
A wheelchair comprising: a main frame (10) having two front wheels
(18); a battery pack (22); and two rear wheel units, each rear wheel unit

including a wheel (20) and a drive motor (24) which, in use, drives the wheel
(20) by means of power derived from the battery pack (22),

Characterised in that
the rear wheel

units being individually removably mounted on the main frame (11) by means
of quick release fastener means (42, 46), and being releasably connected to

the battery pack (22).
A wheelchair according to Claim 1 wherein the frame (11) incorporates
longitudinal support members (66, 68) which extend horizontally when the

chair is in the use position, each rear wheel unit being mountable on at least

one support member (66, 68) by means of mutual insertion in the direction of
extension of the at least one support member (66, 68).
A wheelchair according to Claim 2 wherein each rear wheel unit is
mounted on two said support members (66, 68), the support members (66,

68) being vertically spaced apart when the chair is in the use position.
A wheelchair according to Claim 3 wherein each rear wheel unit is
releasably secured to one of its associated support members (66, 68) by

means of a spring loaded catch (44).
A wheelchair according to Claim 3 or Claim 4 wherein each rear wheel
unit is releasably secured to the other of its associated support members (66,

68) by means of a screw-threaded connection (46).
