<ABSTRACT>
In an electronic package, a solder connection (14) for bonding faying surfaces (31, 40) is formed of tin-bismuth alloy comprising a tertiary metal, preferably gold or silver, in an amount effective to increase the melting temperature of the alloy and enhance mechanical properties of the connection at elevated temperatures typically encountered during operation. A process for forming the solder connection comprises applying a film (36) of the tertiary metal onto at least one faying surface (31) and thereafter applying tin-bismuth solder paste (38) onto the film. Preferably, a plate (26) of tin-bismuth alloy is first electroplated onto the faying surface (31), onto which the tertiary metal is plated. During heating to reflow the solder, the tertiary metal dissolves to produce a uniform liquid that forms the connection.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a solder connection formed of a 
tin-bismuth solder alloy and, more particularly, to such solder 
alloy comprising a tertiary metal, preferably gold or silver, to 
enhance high temperature properties. In one aspect, this 
invention relates to a process for forming a solder connection 
by reflowing tin-bismuth solder paste, wherein the tertiary 
metal is deposited onto the faying surface and dissolves into 
the solder liquid during reflow to improve high temperature 
properties of the product connection. In the manufacture of a microelectronic package, it is 
common practice to attach a component onto a printed circuit 
board or the like by surface mounting utilizing a solder 
connection formed from a solder paste. For this purpose, the 
board features a circuit trace that includes a solder-wettable 
bond pad that constitutes a first faying surface for the 
connection. Similarly, the component includes a second, solder-wettable 
faying surface, for example, a contact. The solder  
 
paste comprises particles of solder alloy dispersed in a 
vaporizable vehicle and containing an expendable organic 
binder. The paste is applied to the faying surface, after which 
the component is assembled with the second faying surface in 
contact with the deposit. The assembly is then heated to melt 
and reflow the solder alloy. Upon cooling, the solder alloy 
resolidifies and bonds to the faying surfaces to complete the 
connection. The solder connection not only physically attaches 
the component to the board, but also electrically connects the 
trace on the board and the contact of the component to conduct 
electrical current to or from the component for processing. The circuit trace in the board is commonly formed of 
copper. In order to protect the copper surface from oxidation 
and thereby enhance wetting by the solder alloy, which 
wetting is essential to forming a strong solder bond, it is 
common practice to electroplate solder alloy onto the bond pad 
prior to applying the solder paste. During reflow, solder liquid 
from the plate and the paste interfuse to form a uniform 
connection. Common solder is composed of tin-lead alloy. It has been 
proposed to form a lead-free solder connection composed of 
tin-bismuth alloy. However, tin-bismuth alloy in the form that 
is electroplated or is commercially available in paste exhibits 
poor mechanical properties at elevated temperatures of the  
 
type typically encountered by microelectronic packages during 
use. In particular, such solder
