<ABSTRACT>
Photochromic oxazine compounds are obtained by condensing an aldehyde which bears a halogen or hydroxyl group in the  alpha -position relative to the aldehyde group (first reaction partner) with (substituted) orthoaminohydroxyaromatic compounds (second reaction partner),

Method for production of photochromic oxazine compounds, in which a diphenyl-,
phenylnaphthyl- or dinaphthylacetaldehyde or an acetaldehyde which is substituted

with heteroaromatics, which acetaldehyde carries a halogen- or hydroxy group in
-position relative to the aldehyde group and which can be substituted, is condensed

with an orthoaminohydroxyaromatic which can be substituted.
Method according to claim 1, in which the carbon atom which carries the aldehyde-and
the halogen- or hydroxy group is part of a ring system.
Method according to claim 2, in which the ring system is fluorene, dibenzosuberone,
xanthene or thioxanthene.
Method according to claim 2, in which the ring system is an aliphatic, monomial alior
heterocycle.
Method according to claim 4, in which the ring system is cyclohexane or
tetrahydropyrane.
Method according to claim 2, in which the ring system is a polycyclic hydrocarbon.
Method according to one of the claims 1 to 6, in which the
orthoaminohydroxyaromatic is a 1-amino-2-naphthol or 2-amino-1-naphthol which

can be substituted.
Method according to one of the claims 1 to 6, in which the
orthoaminohydroxyaromatic is 5-amino-6-hydroxyquinoline or

6-amino-5-hydroxyquinoline.
Method according to one of the claims 1 to 6, in which the
orthoaminohydroxyaromatic is 5-amino-6-hydroxyisoquinoline or 

6-amino-5-hydroxyisoquinoline.
Method according to one of the claims 1 to 6, in which the
orthoaminohydroxyaromatic has an orthoaminohydroxy grouping on an aromatic ring

system which is benzol, naphthalene, phenanthrene, anthracene, quinoline or
isoquinoline which can be further substituted.
