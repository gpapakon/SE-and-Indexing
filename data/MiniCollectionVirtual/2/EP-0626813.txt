<ABSTRACT>
A claimping device for a textile edge (14) comprise an inner wedge shaped casing (2) with an insertion opening for the textile edge (14) and a slide element arranged in the casing slidably away from and toward the wedge point of the casing to a clamping position, wherein the slide element and the one inner side (10) of the casing having a mutually low friction against said displacement, and the other inner side (12) of the casing has a relatively higher friction against a textile material. Since the inner sides (10, 12) of the casing (2) diverge against the insertion opening, and the slide element (6) forms a supporting means for the casing and is provided with a connecting means (8) for fastening of the clamping device to a suspension means (18) for the clamping device, is achieved - in addition to the clamping device in a known way adapting itself to a clamping force proportional to the pulling force attempting to pull the textile edge out of the clamping device - that the mounting of the clamping device on a textile edge and the removal thereof from the textile edge is facilitated, since the slide element of the clamping device forms the suspending means itself for the casing.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a clamping device for an 
elongated textile edge, such as a waistband, a tarpaulin edge 
or the like, which edge preferably is longer than the width 
of the clamping device, and comprising an inner wedge shaped 
casing with an insertion opening for the textile edge and a 
slidably displaceable slide element arranged in the casing 
slidable away from and towards the wedge point of the casing 
for a clamping position, said slide element and the one inner 
side of the casing have a mutually low friction against said 
displacement, and the other inner side of the casing having 
a relatively higher friction against a textile material, the casing 
being shaped like an U, having a U-bottom and two U-legs, and the 
inner surfaces of the U-legs extend divergingly towards the insertion opening. Such clamping device is known from DE-PS 858,234, 
wherein the inner sides of the casing converge towards the 
insertion opening, and the casing itself forms the supporting 
means for the slide element and the textile edge clamped in 
the clamping device. The wedge shaped casing is provided with 
a connecting means in the shape of a ring for securing the 
clamping device to a suspension means for the clamping device 
in the shape of a strap. In US-PS 2,260,378 a belt buckle is disclosed, in 
which the wedge forming sides of the casing diverge against 
the insertion opening, but said buckle is able only to clamp 
or pinch a belt and not e.g. a tarpaulin edge. A clamping device according to the preamble of claim 1 is known from 
FR-A-1 508 297. Contrary to said known art the clamping device 
according to the present invention is characterized in that 
the slide element forms 
a supporting or anchoring means for the casing, and that the 
slide element is provided with a guiding and fastening 
connecting means extending perpendicularly to the bottom of 
the U for the fastening of the clamping device to a suspension 
means for the clamping device, so that the slide element, 
when the clamping device is thus in connected condition, is 
slidably displaceable between the inner bottom surface of the  
 
U and at least to the mouth of the insertion opening. As a 
consequence of the fact that the inner surfaces of the legs 
of the U diverge against the insertion opening, is achieved - 
beyond the clamping device in a known manner is adapting 
itself to a clamping force proportional to the pulling force 
attempting to pull the textile edge out of the clamping 
device - that the mounting of the clamping device

Clamping device for an elongated textile edge (14), such 
as a waistband, the edge of a tarpaulin or similar edge, 

which edge preferably is longer than the width of the 
clamping device, and comprising an inner wedge shaped casing 

(2) with an insertion opening for the textile edge (14) and 
a slidably
 displaceable or movable slide element (6) arranged 
in the casing slidably away from and towards the wedge point 

of the casing for a clamping position, wherein said slide 
element and the one inner side (10) of the casing have a 

mutually low friction against said displacement, and the 
other inner side (12) of the casing having a relatively 

higher friction against a textile material, the casing (2) 
being shaped like a U, having a U-bottom and two U-legs, and

insertion opening, 
characterized in
 that the slide element (6) forms a 
supporting or anchoring means for the casing, and the 

slide element (6) is provided with guiding and fastening 
connecting means (8) extending perpendicularly to the bottom 

of the U-shaped casing for fastening of the clamping device to a suspension 
means (18) for the clamping device in such a way that the 

slide element (6), when the clamping device thus in the 
connected condition, is slidably displaceable between from the 

inner bottom surface of the U and at least to the mouth of 
the insertion opening. 
Clamping device according to claim 1, 
characterized in
 
that where the casing material is flexible and resilient, 

only the innermost inner surface parts close to the U-bottom 
of the casing (2) diverge, while the outermost inner surface 

parts at the insertion opening are parallel. 
Clamping device according to claim 1 or 2, 
characterized 
in
 that the connecting means (8) of the slide element (6) is formed 
to allow fastening of 

the clamping device to one of a trousers suspenders or to a  
 

strap of a stocking suspender, and that the casing (2) and 
the slide element (6) are dimensioned to enable pinching or 

clamping of the common thicknesses of textile edges (14) of 
trousers or stockings. 
Clamping device according to claim 1 or 2,
