<ABSTRACT>
The present invention provides a rotatory GAMMA radiation unit which adapts to medical GAMMA systems 
especially. The radiation source bodies carrying sources can rotate by 360° within a radiation protection 

case. The trace of the radiation line forms several rotating pyramids with tops at the common focus. In this way 
the single successive radiation in the stationary focus manner is changed to multiple-points pulse radiation. 

Therefore, while ensuring the radiation amount, it is possible to decrease the number of the radiation sources and 
simplify the manufacturing engineering. In this way it is possible to kill the disease organisms near the focus, 

and prevent the nuclear radiation line from injuring the healthy organisms outside the focus.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a radiating unit of Gamma cutter
system, and more particularly, to a rotable Gamma-ray radiating unit.The existing Gamma-ray radiating unit, as a key component of a
medical device used in nuclear actinotherapy-Gamma cutter system, in
regard to its configuration, includes a source body consisting of a
number of radiation sources, and the source body is mounted in an
antiradiation protection shielding case with its beam channels being
directed radially toward a common focal point, such as what is
described in European Patent Publication EP-248774. Since the
Gamma cutter employs multiple radiation sources each with only a
small dosage of radiation, it provides the maximum radiation energy
only at the common focal point, so that the tissue with pathological
changes at the focal point will be effectively killed without any harm
to its surrounding healthy tissues in certain period of time. Based on
this consideration, the existing Gamma-ray radiation unit uses as many
radiation sources as possible, for example, in Leksell Gamma Cutter 
produced by Swedish ELEKTA Company, there are 201 radiation
sources arranged regularly on a hemisphere. With quite a number of
radiation sources and the correspondingly increased use of heavy
metallic shielding materials, both the weight and the volume of such
Gamma cutter will be enormous. In terms of manufacturing, to orderly
and accurately make hundreds of holes having a common focal point
on a hemisphere with quite a large diameter calls for rigorous technical
measures and technological equipment. And since the source body is
fixed in the shielding case, and its Gamma rays, even with smaller
radiation energy, statically focus on the tissue of pathological
changes, still needing to continuously get through healthy tissues
to reach the focus of infection, harms will inevitably be caused to
healthy tissues due to the progressive accumulation of radiation time.The object of the present invention is to provide a rotational
coniformly-focused Gamma-ray radiation unit with a simple
configuration and less radiation sources, so as to ensure effective
beam radiations and reduce harms to healthy tissues.The task of the present invention is accomplished in the following
way: the source body of the rotational coniformly-focused Gamma-ray 
radiating unit is a geometrical solid of revolution symmetrical to the
central axis of the radiating unit, several radiation sources and beam
channels are set up in the source body to radially aim at a common
focal
