<ABSTRACT>
The present invention relates to an injectable solution for administration of one or more active compounds. According to the invention the active compound, which is in its neutral form, is solved in a biologically acceptable solvent whereby the active compound by administration precipitates, forming a solid phase of the solution in situ. Thus, said solution, which is easy to sterilize, is acting like a suspension when injected.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention is directed to an injectable solution for
administration of one or more active compounds and a process for
the preparation thereof.Sterile suspensions, i.e. formulations containing at least two phases,
a solid and a liquid phase, are difficult to manufacture in large scale.
Suspensions are by definition thermodynamically instable, and
separation of the different phases will occur with time. Steam
sterilization of such formulations often speeds up the separation.
Aseptic preparation by filtration through a 0.2 µm filter is not
applicable on suspensions. There are few suspension products on the
market of this type. Novalucol® and Roxiam® are examples of
mixtures for oral administration. Oil containing suspensions for
injection are available for CNS indications. There is a need for an
injectable suspension which can be sterilized either by steam
sterilization or by filtration through a 0.2 µm filter.In NL 9000634 stable aqueous suspensions of water-soluble local
anaesthetics and/or narcotic analgesics are disclosed where the local
anaesthetics and/or narcotic analgesics have a specific particle
diameter and said aqueous suspensions also containing a non-ionic
surface-active agent. These suspensions are being sterilized by steam
sterilization or with the aid of gamma rays. When sterilized by 
heating the suspended particles melt and wholly or partly flow
together. To obtain the suspension again the residence is cooled
down to a temperature below the freezing point of the aqueous
medium while shaking. However, this is a complicated way of
sterilizing, it takes time and it is not possible to control the sizes of
the particles recovered.Also in EP 197 308 a ready made suspension including a water
insoluble local anesthetic for injection is disclosed. During steam
sterilization of the suspension the same problem as mentioned above
arises, i.e. the particles of the local anesthetic melts and have to be
resuspended.EP 213 851 discloses injectable semi-solid matrices, which
mechanically hinder the release of the active compound. In fact, it is
the matrice that will be degraded once injected. Also the formulation
here is semi-solid and not solid.It is well-known that solutions can be obtained by chelation with
metal ions. This is disclosed in e.g. US 4 259 331. Here the mixed
metal chelate releases an amount of active compound by injection.
However it is desirable to prepare an injectable solution not
including metal ions, but which solution still precipitates the active
compound once
