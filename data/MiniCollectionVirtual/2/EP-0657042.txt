<ABSTRACT>
This invention describes a way of controlling a plant with multiple inputs and multiple outputs but allowing an operator to direct the control as if each controlled variable had a direct connection to operator controlled variables. An interference network cross fertilizes information from multiple subcontrollers amongst themselves, to allow for enhanced control based on user defined criterion.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to system or process controllers and more specifically to 
nonlinear, time-variable predictive controllers in general, and particularly those based 
on Rate Optimal Control (hereinafter ROC). This will enhance operator control 
because each plant output will appear to be effectively controlled by an individual 
setpoint. Moreover, this invention teaches a unified and systematic approach to 
building robust high-performance control systems that can involve hundreds of control 
loops exhibiting mutual coupling. Previously, there have been two approaches to designing control systems. The 
first approach, called the conventional approach, designs a control system 
incrementally from the bottom up. Starting with individual loops, each process 
variable is assigned a closed loop driven by a single input single output (SISO) 
controller, whose set point represented the desired value of the variable. Due 
to physical interactions between process variables, these loops are not independent of 
each other. Failure to account for this mutual coupling degrades overall controller 
performance, and thus, system performance. To reduce these coupling effects, 
feedforward links and cascade loops are added on an ad hoc basis after the first design 
pass. This procedure often needs to be repeated several times to achieve satisfactory 
system behavior. Moreover, considerable control expertise and in-depth knowledge 
of the controlled process are required to use this approach. The second approach to control system design is based on modern control 
theory which suggests there is, and supplies an exact theoretical solution to the design 
problem. Using this approach, the plant that the controller is being designed for, can 
be treated as a multiple input multiple output (MIMO) system which allows all of the 
characteristics of the process variables to be determined. This "text-book" approach 
however, has not yet been commercially viable because it does not meet several 
important engineering criteria. First, for plants with hundreds of process variables, 
the design algorithms are computationally intractable on current hardware. Secondly 
a controller based on this approach cannot be developed incrementally, nor does it 
support modular design or distributed architectures. Some relevant prior art to help the reader understand the present invention are 
two European Patent Applications, the first "Time-Discrete Adaptive Switching On-Off 
Controller" (EP-A-0 128 491) to Omron Tateisi Electronics Co.,
