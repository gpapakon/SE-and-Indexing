<ABSTRACT>
A security arrangement (1) against forcible entry is arranged on access-closing means, such as windows, window shutters, roller shutters and/or doors of buildings, or lids, doors and/or drawers of cabinet-like elements having at least one openable and closable part (7) and a frame (4). This arrangement (1) consists of a bolt holder (3) secured to the frame (4) and provided with a bolt which may be brought to a locked and to an unlocked position, as well as a bolt receiving part (8) secured to part (7) which cooperates with the bolt receiving part (3). When part (7) is pushed, the bolt receiving part (8) may be moved in relation to the bolt holder over a predetermined distance (a) at least in the opening direction of part (7) between end positions. The end positions of the distance (a) are monitored by surveillance means. When the end positions are reached, the surveillance means emit a signal which actuates an alarm installation (42).

<CLAIMS>
Installation for securing an access against break in, comprising
access closing means (2), such as windows, shutters, roller-shutters and/or

doors of buildings, or covers, doors and/or drawers of elements forming
cupboards

which means (2) consist of at least

one part (7) to be opened and closed having a closing mechanism and a fixed
frame part (4), containing a locking device, which is composed of a bolting

means holding element (3), mountable on the part (7) to be opened and closed
or on the frame part (4), with a bolting means (25) which can be brought into a

locked and an unlocked position, and a bolting means receiving element (8),
mountable on the part (7) to be opened and closed or on the frame part (4), in

which the bolting means (25) engages in the locked state, and monitoring
means (10, 14, 15, 41) and an alarm device (42), characterised in that the

bolting means (25) is held pivotable in at least the direction of opening of the
part (7) to be opened and closed, and is pivotable by a predetermined distance

(a) toward a stop position upon pressing up of the part (7) together with the
bolting means receiving element (8) with respect to the bolting means holding

element (3), and the reaching of the stop position of the distance (a) is
monitored by the monitoring means, which monitoring means transmit a signal

upon the reaching of the stop position of the bolting means (25), which
activates the alarm device (42).
Installation according to claim 1, characterised in that the bolting
means (25) is held by elastic means (35, 36) in resting position in a middle

position of the pivoting out.
Installation according to claim 1 or 2, characterised in that the locking
and the unlocking of the bolting means (25) takes place through an actuator

(22), in that the locked position and the unlocked position of the bolting means 
(25) are detectable by sensors (28, 29) and the position of the closed part (7)

by a further sensor (38).
Installation according to claim 3, characterised in that the actuation of
the actuator (22) for the bolting means (25) takes place by remote control, and

in that control electronics (41) are provided, which are connected to a current
supply (37), and which receive the signals supplied by the remote control and

by the sensors, and transmit corresponding output signals and check-back
signals.
Installation according to one of the claims 1 to 4, characterised in that
the bolting means holding element (3) is fixed to the frame part (4), and the

bolting means receiving element (8) is fixed to the part (7) to be opened and
closed, and in that the bolting means holding element (3) is provided with a

covering (5) which has a slot (6) for receiving the bolting means receiving
element (8) consisting essentially of a vertical plate (43), in which an opening

has been made, and a fastening plate (44).
Installation according to one of the claims 1 to 5, characterised in that
the bolting means consists of a bolt (25) which is displaceable in the direction

of its longitudinal axis essentially transversely to the opening direction of the
part (7) to be opened and closed, which bolt (25) in the locked state projects

through a first opening (32) of a first crosspiece (14) of the bolting means
holding element (3), and in a second opening (33) of a second crosspiece (15)

of the bolting means holding element (3) disposed essentially parallel to the
first crosspiece (14), and in that the bolt (25) goes through an opening (34),

which is made in the bolting means receiving part (8), which lies between the
first crosspiece (14) and the second crosspiece (15).
Installation according to claim 6, characterised in that the bolt (25) is
disposed longitudinally displaceable in a holding element (16, 24), which

holding element (16, 24) is disposed in the bolting means holding element (3)
pivotable about a pivot axis (18), which runs essentially parallel to the

longitudinal axis of the bolt (25), and in that the holding element (16) is 
maintained in the middle position by the elastic means (35, 36), so that the bolt

(25) in the locked position comes to lie essentially centred in the first opening
(32) and in the second opening (33).
Installation according to one of the claims 6 or 7, characterised in that
the bolt (25) with the first crosspiece (14) and/or the second crosspiece (15) is

designed as part of an electric circuit, which electric circuit is closed when the

bolt (25) touches at least one of the two crosspieces (14) or respectively (15),
the closing of the electric circuit leading to the transmission of a signal by the

control electronics (41) to set off an alarm.
Installation according to one of the claims 6 to 8, characterised in that
the shifting of the bolt (25) in the direction of its longitudinal axis takes place by

means of an electromotor (22) provided with a screw rod (23), which screw rod
(23) co-operates with a link (30) having an opening with corresponding screw

thread, which link is adjustably connected to the bolt (25).
Installation according to one of the claims 4 to 9, characterised in
that a battery (37) accommodated in the bolting means holding element (3) is

provided as the current supply.
