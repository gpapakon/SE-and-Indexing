<ABSTRACT>
Noise reduction circuitry, in a video signal compression 
apparatus of the predictive DPCM compression type includes a 

simple nonlinear processing element (500) within the DPCM loop 
(12,15,16,18,1333) to eliminate residu
es between predicted and 
real image signals, which are smaller than a predetermined value. 

Elimination of such residues dramatically reduces the amount of 
compressed data generated for signals including even modest 

amounts of noise.

<DESCRIPTION>
This application relates to noise reduction for
differential pulse code modulation DPCM video signal compression
apparatus, and more particularly to noise reduction apparatus for
use within the DPCM loop.Predictive coding for compression of video signal
functions best when current images are easily predicted from
temporally adjacent images. However when the source images
contain noise, accurate prediction becomes difficult and the
compression efficiency declines or the reproduced image quality
degrades or both. It is therefore desirable to minimize noise in
the video signal to be compressed prior to the compression
process.Consider FIGURE 1 which illustrates a prior art
predictive image coding system. Elements 12-22 form the actual
predictive coder which will be described herein after. Noise
reduction, in such prior art systems typically include a recursive
noise reduction filter 10 to preprocess the video signal prior to
compression. Field or frame recursive filters tend to have been
preferred because they can effectively reduce noise components
within the bandwidth of the active signal. However, such filters
are also very memory intensive and require relatively
sophisticated processing circuitry in order to perform significant
noise reduction without introducing undesirable artifacts around
moving image features. US-A-4 179 710 and EP-A-0 346 636 disclose predictive video encoders using a non-linear noise limiter in the DPCM loop.It is an object of the present invention to provide a
highly effective noise reduction apparatus and method for MPEG-like
encoders with minimal additional hardware.This object is achieved by the subject-matter of claim 1. The dependent claims relate to preferred embodiments.The claimed MPEG-like
encoding apparatus uses a simple nonlinear processing
element included in the DPCM loop to eliminate residues
between predicted and real image signals, which are smaller than
a predetermined value. Elimination of such residues will
dramatically reduce the amount of compressed data generated for
signals including even modest amounts of noise. FIGURE 1 is a block diagram of prior art DCPM
compression apparatus.FIGURES 2 and 4 are block diagrams of alternative
compression apparatus including noise reduction apparatus
according to the present invention.FIGURES 3 and 5 are pictorial diagrams of exemplary
nonlinear transfer functions for the noise reduction apparatus of
FIGURES 2 and 4.The present invention will be described in the context
of video compression similar to that described in
