<ABSTRACT>
A sorter having a stapler incorporated therein is provided 
for an image forming apparatus. The sorter includes a 

plurality of vertically arranged bins (21), where at least 
the ends of the bins holding the trailing edges of the 

sheets are vertically movable. Sheet supplying means (24) 
are provided for transporting the sheets from the image 

forming apparatus to the sheet bins (21). A stapler (22) is 
disposed above the sheet supplying means (24) for stapling 

a stack of sheets while stored in each bin (21). Further 
provided are storage bin transporting means (25) for moving 

the plurality of bins (21) in vertical succession while 
maintaining predetermined spacings (S1, S2) between 

successive bins when moved into a position corresponding to 
the stapler (22). The storage bin transporting means (25) 

also is adapted to maintain a spacing (S3) above each bin 
(21) when it comes into position corresponding to the sheet 

supplying means (24).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates generally to sorters. More 
specifically, it relates to a sorter incorporating a stapler for 
stapling stacks of sheets. A conventional copying machine may be provided with a sorter 
for sorting and storing image-formed sheets, and a type of sorter 
includes a stapler for stapling stacks of sheets. Japanese Patent Laying-Open No. 231757/1989 discloses one of 
the conventional sorters which incorporates a stapler. This 
sorter is provided with a plurality of receiving bins into which 
sheets are sorted in order. The bins are vertically disposed and 
vertically movable. A sheet supplier provided near the lower end 
of the bins supplies sheets discharged from a copying machine 
into the bins. A stapler for stapling the stacks of sheets 
stored in the bins is provided in the sheet supplier. In this conventional sorter, a predetermined gap is provided 
between adjacent bins through which sheets are transported from 
the sheet supplier into the bins. The stack of sheets stored in 
each bin is stapled by the stapler. The stapler is rotatable 
through a predetermined angle between a drawn position, to clear 
the movement of the bins, and a stapling position at which the 
stapling operation is executed.  Japanese Patent Laying-Open No. 23154/1990 discloses another 
sorter having a plurality of bins each of which is immobile. 
Sheets from a copying machine are transported into the bins by 
corresponding claws provided in a transporting mechanism. In the 
sorter is a vertically movable stapler. The stapling operation of the sorter is performed as 
follows: the stapler is moved vertically; a nipper draws a stack 
of sheets from a bin into a stapling position; the stapler 
staples the stack of sheets; and the nipper moves the stack of 
sheets back into the bin. In the sorter disclosed in Japanese Patent Laying-Open No. 
231757/1989, the stapler is provided in the sheet supplier, 
wherein the stapler is potentially an obstruction to the vertical 
movement of the bins. Consequently, it is necessary to provide a 
mechanism for rotating the stapler between the stapling position 
and the drawn position, which thus complicates the structure. In 
the sorter disclosed in Japanese Patent Laying-Open No. 
23154/1990, it is necessary to provide, in addition to the 
stapler, a device which draws each stack of sheets from, and 
returns each stack into the bins, therein complicating the 
structure as well. These two conventional sorters, however, cannot accommodate 
any number of stacks of sheets

<CLAIMS>
A sorter having a stapler for sorting and stapling 
sheets discharged from a discharger of an image 

forming apparatus, comprising: 
a plurality of sheet storages (21) arranged 

vertically, whereby at least those ends of the 
storages holding the trailing edges of sheets are 

vertically movable; 
means (24) for supplying the sheets from the 

discharger of said image forming apparatus to said 
plurality of sheet storages (21); 

stapling means (22) disposed above said sheet 
supplying means (24) for stapling a stack of sheets 

while stored in each sheet storage (21); and
