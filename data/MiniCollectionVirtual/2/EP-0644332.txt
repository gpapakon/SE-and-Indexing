<ABSTRACT>
Liquid ring (fluid ring) gas pump with a flow path for the gas-liquid mixture leaving the pumping chamber and a noise suppression (silencing) device which is formed by a buffer chamber (4) which, with its opening, adjoins the flow path and is otherwise essentially closed, and which partially fills with gas and acts as a pressure pulse attenuator and silencer with respect to the gas-liquid mixture flowing past. To this end it expediently extends vertically, with a length which is large compared with its width and its opening cross-section.

<CLAIMS>
A liquid ring gas pump with a flow path for the gas-liquid 
mixture emerging from the delivery chamber and with 

noise-suppressing means, characterised in that the opening 
of a buffer chamber (4) adjoins the flow path, which buffer 

chamber extends upwards from this opening and which, 
moreover, is substantially closed, wherein 


the buffer chamber is longer than it is wide 
and/or the length of the buffer chamber is at least 
1.5 times as great as the root of the cross-sectional 

area of its opening 
and/or the opening cross-section of the buffer 
chamber is not greater than 0.8 times the square of 

the third root of its volume. 
A liquid ring gas pump according to Claim 1, 
characterised in that the buffer chamber provides a calmed 

flow at least in its upper region. 
A liquid ring gas pump according to Claim 1 or 2, 
characterised in that the buffer chamber is elongated 

vertically. 
A liquid ring gas pump according to any one of Claims 1 
to 3, characterised in that the volume of the buffer chamber 

corresponds at least approximately to 0.2 times the volume 
of the delivery chamber of the pump. 
A liquid ring gas pump according to any one of Claims 1 
to 4, characterised in that the volume of the buffer chamber 

is at least equal to the third power of the unobstructed 
diameter of the delivery connector.  

 
A liquid ring gas pump according to any one of Claims 1 
to 5, characterised in that delivery openings are provided 

which can be closed by valves and which discharge into the 
buffer chamber. 
A liquid ring gas pump according to Claim 6, 
characterised in that only the gas-liquid mixture emerging 

from the region of the delivery slot which cannot be closed 
by valves moves past the buffer chamber. 
A liquid ring gas pump according to any one of Claims 1 
to 7, characterised in that a double-walled pipe extending 

from the delivery connector projects into the delivery 
chamber with a compartment forming the buffer chamber 

between the two pipe walls. 
A liquid ring gas pump according to any one of Claims 1 
to 8, characterised in that the size of the opening of the 

buffer chamber (4) is at a ratio of 0.5 to 2 relative to the 
unobstructed diameter of the delivery connector at the level 

of its connecting flange.
