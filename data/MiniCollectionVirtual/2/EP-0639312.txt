<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a digital TDMA/FDMA (Time Division Multiple Access/Frequency Division Multiple Access) cellular network system, comprising (i) base stations (11) forming radio cells (C1 to C62), each of said base stations having a determined static frequency of a control channel of the cell and comprising a first transceiver (TRX1) transmitting continuously control data of the system concerning said cell at said control channel frequency at least in one predetermined time slot (TSO) of a TDMA frame (40), the TDMA frame of said first transceiver including traffic channels at least in a part of the other time slots, and at least one second transceiver (TRX2...TRX4) for the traffic channels, and (ii) mobile stations (12) connected to the base stations (11) via a radio path. To provide a system suitable for a microcellular network and to maximize the advantage to be gained from interference diversity, the traffic channels of said second transceiver units (TRX2...TRX4) use frequency hopping at least in a part of the radio cells in such a way that, on those traffic channels aligned with the predetermined time slots (TSO) of the control data of the cell in said first transceiver (TRX1), substantially all frequencies of the available frequency band, except said control data transmission frequency determined for the cell, belong to the hopping sequence, and on those traffic channels which are in the other time slots, (TSN, N NOTEQUAL 0), substantially all frequencies of the available frequency band belong to the hopping sequence.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to cellular network systems
according to the preambles of the attached
claims 1, 5 and 9. The cellular network systems according
to the invention may conform to the GSM system
known per se, for instance.New requirements arise when mobile phone services
are offered in urban population centres: the
system is supposed to have a large capacity, base
station equipment should be small-sized because of
the very limited possibilities of providing equipment
rooms in urban areas, and the system should operate
on low radio power levels to make small-sized sub-scriber's
units possible. Moreover, the system is
expected to cover also the interior of buildings and
to offer a good coverage in spite of the fact that it
is difficult to predict the radio coverage of antennas
to be positioned at low elevations. In addition
to the above, the system is supposed to offer an
easier frequency planning of a radio network than
before. Such cellular networks are built of so-called
short-range microcells.To build a mobile phone network in an environment
as described above is a task very different from
realizing a classic cellular network. While the primary
object of a cellular network is to minimize the
number of base station sites by increasing the range
of the cells to the technical maximum and by installing
the maximum number of transceiver units permitted
by the frequency band of the network on each base
station site, the primary object of microcellular
networks is to achieve low radio powers and small installation
units suitable for outdoor deployment.However, conventional cellular technique (cell 
splitting) does not meet the requirements of a microcellular
network. This is due to the fact that with
the cell radius decreasing and the radio coverage at
the same time becoming more difficult to predict than
before (because antennas are positioned below roof-tops
to restrict the cell size) either the overlapping
of the cells increases or the coverage of the
system is compromised (depending on a shadowing caused
by buildings or natural obstacles in each direction).
An increasing degree of overlapping of the
cells makes it necessary to widen the reuse pattern,
which eliminates at least part of the additional capacity
supposed to be obtained by means of cell
splitting.The object of the present invention is thus to
provide a digital TDMA/FDMA (Time Division Multiple
Access/Frequency Division Multiple Access) cellular
network system, e.g. a TDMA/FDMA cellular system according
to the GSM system, in order to comply
