<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to an apparatus for 
subsequently transporting articles of predetermined 

dimensions, said apparatus comprising: a frame (1,10); at least two 
conveyors (T₁,T₂T₃), each of which comprising 

an endless belt element (16) 
and at least two reversing wheels (12,14), the parallel rotation 

axes (6) of which coincide for the conveyors (T₁,T₂,T₃); 
and a drive (2,3,4,5) for 

the belt elements (16), wherein each conveyor (T₁,T₂,T₃) 
has a body (10) 

supporting the upper part of the belt element (16), wherein at 
least one supporting body (10) is coupled by means of displacing 

elements (V₁,V₂,V₃) to at least two guides (19) 
placed parallel to the 

rotation axes (6) of said reversing wheels (12,14), whereby the or each 
conveyor (T₁,T₂,T₃) is displaceable along said guides 

(19) transversely of 
the transporting direction of said belt elements (16). 
With an apparatus according to the invention it is 
possible to obtain optimum support of the article to be 

transported by the conveyors (T₁,T₂,T₃) in terms of 
robustness and 

stability, since the conveyors are adjustable (V₁,V₂,V₃) 
in the direction transversely of the transporting direction, 

wherein the distances between two adjacent conveyors 
(T₁,T₂,T₃) are 

equal for each pair of conveyors (T₁-T₂;T₂-T₃) 
at any distance occurring 

between the outer conveyors. It is likewise possible to 
adapt the conveyors (T₁,T₂T₃) in an apparatus 

according to the 
invention to the length in the transporting direction of the 

articles to be transported in order to prevent shifting of 
the articles.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an apparatus
for consequently transporting articles of predetermined
dimensions, said apparatus comprising:
a frame with at least two guides, at least one of which
is rotatable;at least two conveyors each comprising:
an endless belt element;at least two reversing wheels the parallel
rotation axes of which coincide for the conveyors; anda body supporting the upper part of the belt
element, wherein at least one supporting body of said at
least two conveyors is connected by means of displacing
elements to said rotatable guide arranged parallel to the
rotation axes of said reversing wheels to displace at
least one of said at least two conveyors transversely of
the transporting direction of said belt element upon
rotation of said guide, and drive means for said belt elements and said rotatable
guide.An article transporting apparatus of the type
described above is known from the Japanese patent
application JP-A-6105407, where the distance between
separate conveyors is adjusted by means of a connection
of said conveyors to a guide with a screw thread. The
conveyors are displaceable along the guides.The known apparatus has the disadvantage, that
displacement of the conveyors is limited to the extent,
to which the guides are screw threaded. Also, the known
apparatus has the disadvantage, that the conveyors are
only arranged for displacement to or from each other, so
that only two conveyors can be used in such a known
device. If further support for an article, which is wide 
in comparison to the direction of transport, is necessary
in case the distance between the conveyors has become
large as a result of the dimensions of the article, no
further support is provided, and neither are measures to
position such a further support.The present invention relates to an apparatus
of the type described above, in which the disadvantages
described above are obviated. According to the present
invention this is achieved, in that said guide is rod-like
and arranged for driving thereof to rotate, and that
each displacement element comprises a housing for at
least two rollers, said rollers each being arranged to
roll over said guide upon rotation thereof, where a
displacement along said guide resulting from said
rotation is predetermined by means of the angle between
rotation axes of rollers of one of said conveyors and a
rotation axis of said guide.With an apparatus according to the present
invention possible displacement of the conveyors along a
guide is not limited by screw thread along the

Apparatus for consequently transporting
articles of predetermined dimensions, said apparatus

comprising:

a frame (1) with at least two guides (19), at least one
of which is rotatable;
at least two conveyors (T1, T2, T3), each comprising:

an endless belt element (16);
at least two reversing wheels (11, 12; 14), the
parallel rotation axes of which coincide for the

conveyors; and
a body (10) supporting the upper part of the belt
element, wherein at least one supporting body of said at

least two conveyors is connected by means of displacing
elements (V1, V2, V3) to said rotatable guide arranged

parallel to the rotation axes of said reversing wheels to
displace at l
east one of said at least two conveyors
transversely of the transporting direction of said belt

element upon rotation of said guide, and
drive means for said belt elements (2-5) and for said
rotatable guide (27),
characterized in that

said guide (19) is rod-like and arranged for driving
thereof to rotate, and that each displacement element

(V1, V2, V3) comprises a housing (24, 25) for at least
two rollers (23), said rollers each being arranged to

roll over said guide upon rotation thereof, where a
displacement along said guide resulting from said

rotation is predetermined by the angle between rotation
axes of rollers of one of said conveyors and a rotation

axis of said guide.
Apparatus as claimed in claim 1, 
characterized
in that
 the angle enclosed by said rotation axis of
each roller of said displacing elements of one of said

conveyors and the centre line of said guides varies by a
factor of two from that of an adjacent conveyor.
Apparatus as claimed in claims 1 and 2,

characterized in that
 said guides are supported in the frame
at least at one end.
Apparatus as claimed in claims 1-3,

characterized in that
 said belt element of at least one
conveyor has bodies in the form of protrusions engaging the

leading side of said articles to be transported and the belt
element of each of the at least two other conveyors has 

protrusion-like bodies engaging the trailing side of said
articles to be transported.
Apparatus as claimed in claims 1-4,

characterized in that
 said belt elements having protrusion-like
bodies engaging said trailing side of said articles to

be transported or said belt elements having protrusion-like
bodies engaging said leading side of said articles to be

transported are adjustably in said transporting direction
coupled to the drive.
Apparatus as claimed in claims 1-5,

characterized in that
 said protrusion-like bodies engaging
said articles to be transported are vulcanized onto said

belt elements.
Apparatus as claimed in claims 1-6,

characterized in that
 each substantially L-shaped body
