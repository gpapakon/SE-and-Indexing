<ABSTRACT>
Methods and compositions are disclosed utilizing the pure S(+) isomer of fluoxetine which is a potent antidepressant and appetite suppressant substantially free of unwanted, adverse toxic or psychological effects. In addition, methods and compositions are disclosed utilizing the pure S(+) isomer of fluoxetine which is useful in treating migraine headaches, pain, in particular chronic pain, and obsessive-compulsive disorders. Further, methods and compositions for treating a condition alleviated or improved by inhibition of serotonin uptake in serotonergic neurons and platelets in a human using optically pure S(+) fluoxetine are disclosed.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a novel
composition of matter which possesses potent
antidepressant activity as a serotonin uptake
inhibitor while avoiding the usual detrimental
factors, unwanted effects and adverse toxic or
psychological effects associated with such agents.
Also disclosed are methods of using said composition
to treat depression while avoiding the usual
detrimental factors, unwanted effects and side effects
associated with such agents.The invention further relates to a
composition of matter containing optically pure S(+)
fluoxetine which has activity as a weight loss agent
while avoiding the usual detrimental factors, unwanted
effects, and adverse toxic or psychological effects
which are associated with the racemic mixture of
fluoxetine. In addition, these compositions possess
potent activity in the treatment of migraine
headaches,
while avoiding the usual detrimental factors, unwanted
effects and adverse toxic or psychological effects
associated with the racemic mixture of fluoxetine.
Also disclosed are methods of using these
compositions of matter
for the preparation of medicaments
for the treatment of
migraine headaches,
in a human by administering pure S(+) 
fluoxetine. These methods also avoid the usual
detrimental factors, unwanted effects, and adverse
toxic or psychological effects associated with
administration of the racemic mixture of fluoxetine.The active compound of this composition and
method is an optical isomer of the compound fluoxetine
which is described in U.S. Patent Nos. 4,018,895 and
4,194,009 to Molloy, et al. Chemically, this isomer
is (+)N-methyl-3-phenyl-3-[(α,α,α-trifluoro-p-tolyl)-oxy]-propylamine,
herein after referred to as S(+)
fluoxetine.Many organic compounds exist in optically
active forms, i.e., they have the ability to rotate
the plane of plane-polarized light. In describing an
optically active compound, the prefixes D and L or R
and S are used to denote the absolute configuration of
the molecule about its chiral center(s). The prefixes
(+) and (-) or d and 1 are employed to designate the
sign of rotation of plane-polarized light by the
compound, with (-) or 1 meaning that the compound is
levorotatory. A compound prefixed with (+) or d is
dextrorotatory. For a given chemical structure, these
compounds, called stereoisomers, are identical except
that they are mirror images of one another. A
specific stereoisomer may also be referred to as an
enantiomer, and a mixture of such isomers is often
called an enantiomeric or racemic mixture.Stereochemical purity is

<CLAIMS>
Use of S(+)fluoxetine or a pharmaceutically
acceptable salt thereof, substantially free of its R(-)

stereoisomer, for the manufacture of a medicament for use
in the treatment of migraine headaches, said treatment

comprising the administration of S(+)fluoxetine or a
pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof in an amount

sufficient to have a therapeutic effect but insufficient
to cause unwanted, adverse toxic or psychological effects

of racemic fluoxetine.
A use as claimed in claim 1, wherein the medicament
is adapted for oral administration, intravenous

delivery, transdermal delivery, or parenteral
administration.
A use as claimed in either claim 1 or claim 2,
wherein the amount of S(+)fluoxetine or pharmaceutically

acceptable salt thereof is administered at a rate of 1mg
to 100mg, preferably 20mg to 80mg and most preferably

25mg to 75mg per day.
A use as claimed in any of the preceding claims,
wherein the amount of S(+)fluoxetine or pharmaceutically

acceptable salt thereof, comprises at least about 90%
and, preferably, at least about 99% of the total amount

of fluoxetine therein. 
A use as claimed in any of the preceding claims,
wherein the S(+)fluoxetine is in admixture with a

pharmaceutically acceptable carrier.
A use as claimed in any of the preceding claims,
wherein the medicament comprises a hydrochloride salt of

S(+)fluoxetine.
A use as claimed in any of the preceding claims,
wherein the amount of S(+)fluoxetine or a

pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof is 1mg to
100mg and, preferably, 1mg to 20mg.
A use as claimed in claim 7, wherein the medicament
is administered from one to four times a day and, in

preferred options, once or twice a day.
