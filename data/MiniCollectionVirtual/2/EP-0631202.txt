<ABSTRACT>
A method of presetting the time for automatically checking a copying machine and 
making quality adjustments in the machine by an image quality monitoring element including 

the steps of providing a plurality of presetting time options (114) on a screen display of a user 
interface, selecting (116, 122) a set of preset times (118) to initiate checking the machine by the 

image quality monitoring element, storing in the controller the set of preset times to initiate 
checking the machine by the image quality monitoring element, and responding to the set of 

preset times to activate the image quality monitoring element.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to image quality adjustments and more particularly, to customer
schedulable machine quality adjustment in an image reproduction machine.It is important in the operation of complex electronic equipment such as reproduction
machines to maintain the quality of the finished copy sheets. Today's copiers must routinely perform
a copy quality (CQ) check to insure that copies will be of the highest quality for the customer. Due to
process control requirements, these copy quality checks may occur several times a day. The time
when these CQ checks are performed may interrupt the customer's use of the copier for several
minutes. This can not only be annoying and inconvenient for the operator, but may impede machine
productivity as well. It is important for machine efficiency to minimize the time spent in these CQ
checks and adjustments, especially during peak productivity periods. The need for quality
adjustments becomes even more crucial in machines adapted for highlight color or full color
reproductions since these machines often require more extensive or more frequent analysis and
correction to produce a quality color product.It is known in prior art machines for the machine to cycle down in the middle of a
reproduction job to initiate a needed copy quality adjustment. Sometimes manual operator
intervention is needed to initiate the quality adjustment or to cycle up and return the machine from
the adjustment phase to resume completing the reproduction job. This type of required operator
attention is particularly inefficient. Also, in prior art machines, the machine may simply cycle down
after completion of a job when a quality adjustment is needed and require operator initiation of the
quality adjustment.US-A-5 245 389 discloses image reproduction apparatus in which image quality
adjustment is executed by detecting the state of components in the apparatus and determining
proper values for the operation thereof. Image quality adjustment can be executed either
automatically or manually.While quality adjustments are necessary to maintain machine quality standards, a truly
productive machine must minimize machine downtime for quality checks during peak productivity
hours. It would be desirable, therefore, to minimize machine lost productivity during machine quality
adjustments. It would also be desirable to be able to automatically initiate a quality adjustment at
preset times of known machine inactivity and machine non use. It would also be desirable to allow a
machine key operator to

<CLAIMS>
An image quality adjustment method in an image processing apparatus (30)
having image processing components (32, 34) for forming images on a

medium, and a controller (33) for directing the operation of the image
processing components (32, 34) including a user interface (36) and an image

quality analyzing and adjusting element for effecting image quality adjustment
in the apparatus (30) in one or more modes, the method comprising:


providing a plurality of preset time slot options,
selecting one or more preset time slot options to set one or more options
for effecting image quality adjustment in the apparatus (30) by the image

quality analyzing and adjusting element,
storing the selected time slot options for effecting image quality
adjustment in the apparatus (30) in the controller (33), and
responding to said selected time slot option or options to activate the
image quality analyzing and adjusting element for effecting image quality

adjustment in the apparatus (30).
The method of claim 1 wherein image quality adjustment is effected by
recognizing a deviation from predetermined image quality standards, and

providing a quality adjustment to the image processing apparatus (30) in
response to said deviation from said predetermined image quality standards at

said time slot options.
The method of claim 1 or 2, further including:

scrolling through said time slot options on a screen display (51).
The method of claim 3, further including:

highlighting particular time slot options for deletion.
The method of claim 3, further including:

highlighting particular time slot options for alteration.
An image processing apparatus (30) having:

image processing components (32, 34) for forming images on a medium;
and
a controller (33) for directing the operation of the image processing
components (32, 34), including:


a user interface (36),
an image quality analyzing and adjusting element for checking the
operation of the apparatus (30),
means for providing a plurality of preset time slot options,
a selector for selecting one or more of a plurality of time slot options
for checking the apparatus (30) by the image quality analyzing and

adjusting element,
means for storing the selected plurality of time slot options in the
controller (33), and
means for responding to said selected plurality of time slot options to
activate the image quality analyzing and adjusting element for

checking the apparatus (30).
