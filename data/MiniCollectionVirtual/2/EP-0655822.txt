<ABSTRACT>
A splashproof cover 7 for a miniature motor comprises a plastics material body having 
a connector 15 moulded thereon for connection to a power supply. Two conductors 

17 are moulded in the body 8 and each comprise a terminal 16 disposed within the 
connector 15, and a body part 18 from which a tongue 19 projects. The tongues 19 

are received in female terminal slots 6 in the motor end cap 3 to make electrical 
contact with the motor terminals 5 and have serrated edges which engage end walls of 

the slots 6 to secure the cover to the end cap. A skirt 9 on the body 8 surrounds the 
periphery 10 of the end cap 3.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a miniature electric motor and in particular to a 
miniature motor with a splashproof cover. Small permanent magnet d.c. motors may be used in situations where they may be 
exposed to water, for example, in vehicles. To prolong efficient motor operation, a 
splashproof or waterproof sleeve can be put over the can-like motor casing. However, 
it is not easy to cover the motor end cap due to the presence of the terminals. 
Different vehicle manufacturers require different terminal configurations which obliges 
the motor manufacturer to provide end caps with different configurations. A prior design proposed by the present applicant is described in GB2225672. The 
cover was designed specifically for the end cap of an electric motor having male motor 
terminals and also required the end cap to be manufactured with separate slots formed 
in the end cap to receive mounting or locking pins. Accordingly, the splashproof 
cover had apertures in the body of the cover adapted to receive the male motor 
terminals and electrically connect them with the external terminals of the splashproof 
cover. While this cover performed satisfactorily, it did have a disadvantage in that a 
significant number of motor terminals were damaged during assembly of the 
splashproof cover to the motor end cap resulting in unsatisfactory connections 
between the motor terminal and the terminals of the cover. This was caused by a slight 
misalignment between the motor terminals and the apertures in the cover during 
assembly. Due to the thinness of the cover in the area of the apertures, there was not 
sufficient material to provide an adequate lead-in to the apertures for the motor 
terminals to accommodate the misalignment during assembly. Making the cover 
thicker to provide this lead-in increased the length of the motor. The present invention aims to at least reduce the disadvantages of known splashproof 
covers for miniature motors and in particular, to provide a splashproof cover for a 
miniature motor having female terminals. This is achieved by providing the 
splashproof cover with axially extending male terminals adapted to engage the female 
motor terminals located within slots formed in the end cap and the cover terminals 
having serrated or sawtooth like edges which bite into the end walls of the slots to 
secure the cover to the end cap. This does away with the apertures on the splashproof  
 
cover and the need for separate mounting or holding pins to secure the cover to the 
end cap. This

<CLAIMS>
A miniature electric motor comprising a can-like casing (2) having one open 
end, an end cap (3) closing the open end of the casing and supporting motor terminals 

(5), a rotor including a shaft (4) rotatably mounted in bearings fitted to the end cap (3) 
and casing (2), and a splashproof cover (7) covering the end cap (3) and connecting 

the motor terminals (5) to an external connector (15) formed on the cover (3), 
characterized in that the motor terminals (5) are female terminals disposed in slots (6) 

formed in the end cap (3) and the cover (7) has tongue-like terminals (19) with 
serrated edges (20) disposed within the slots (6) and making electrical contact with the 

female terminals (5), the serrated edges (20) of the cover terminals (19) being engaged 
with end walls of the slots (6) to resist removal from the slots, thereby securing the 

cover (7) to the end cap (3). 
A motor as defined in Claim 1 wherein the cover has a dependent peripheral 
skirt (9) which extends axially of the motor along an outer periphery of the end cap. 
A motor as defined in Claim 2 wherein the peripheral skirt (9) extends axially 
of the motor to cover at least a portion of the casing (2) and is adapted to sealingly 

engage with a housing of an appliance to which the motor is fitted. 
A motor as defined in any one of the preceding claims wherein the cover (7) 
comprises a generally circular solid moulded plastics material planar body (8) integrally 

formed with the external connector (15) and embedding conductors (17) integral with 
the tongue-like terminals (19) and forming terminal elements (16) in the external 

connector. 
A motor as defined in any one of the preceding claims wherein means (22) 
formed between the cover (7) and the end cap (3) allows fitting of the cover (7) to the 

end cap (3) in only one orientation.
