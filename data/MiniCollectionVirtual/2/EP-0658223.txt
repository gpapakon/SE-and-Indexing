<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a heald control system, in
particular, a heald control system for selectively moving individual heald
rods to an upper or lower shed position.Examples of heald control systems of the type described above are
disclosed in GB 1467231 and EP 0556165.In GB 1467231 there is disclosed a heald control system for moving
individual heald rods to an upper or lower shed position, the system
including a plurality of stiff heald rods, at least one motive assembly
oscillating between upper and lower positions corresponding to said upper
and lower shed positions, the motive assembly including for each
individual heald rod selectively actuatable engagement means which on
actuation engages the heald rod to connect it to the motive assembly and
cause it to be moved toward one of said positions.In GB 1467231 the engagement means are in the form of
electromagnets which magnetically engage the upper end of the associated
heald rod.In EP 0556165 the motive assembly oscillates along a path which
is displaced laterally from the longitudinal axes of the heald rods and
includes engagement means in the form of latches which on actuation
move toward the associated heald rod to connect it to the motive unit.According to the present invention there is provided a heald control
system for moving individual heald rods to an upper (US) or lower shed
(LS) position, the system including a plurality of stiff heald rods, each of
which is reciprocally movable along their longitudinal axis between said
upper and lower shed positions, at least one motive unit oscillating
between upper and lower positions corresponding to said upper and lower
shed positions, the motive unit including for each individual heald rod
selectively actuatable engagement means which on actuation connect an
associated heald rod to the motive unit and cause it to be moved toward 
one of said positions characterised in that, during oscillation, the motive
unit is arranged to travel along a path located laterally to the longitudinal
axes of the heald rods, each engagement means on actuation being
movable toward the associated heald rod to connect the heald rod to the
motive unit, each motive means including a plurality of elongate carriers
for the actuatable engagement means, the elongate carriers being arranged
such that they extend longitudinally along said path of travel of the motive
means, a group of engagement means being mounted on each carrier in a
linear row extending along the length of the carrier, the linear row being
inclined

<CLAIMS>
A heald control system for moving individual heald rods to an
upper (US) or lower shed (LS) position, the system including a plurality

of stiff heald rods (11), each of which is reciprocally movable along their
longitudinal axis between said upper and lower shed positions, at least one

motive unit (30) oscillating between upper and lower positions
corresponding to said upper and lower shed positions, the motive unit

including for each individual heald rod selectively actuatable engagement
means (33) which on actuation connect an associated heald rod to the

motive unit and cause it to be moved toward one of said positions
characterised in that, during oscillation, the motive unit is arranged to

travel along a path located laterally to the longitudinal axes of the heald
rods, each engagement means on actuation being movable toward the

associated heald rod to connect the heald rod to the motive unit, each
motive means (30) including a plurality of elongate carriers (36) for the

actuatable engagement means, the elongate carriers being arranged such
that they extend longitudinally along said path of travel of the motive

means, a group of engagement means (33) being mounted on each carrier
in a linear row extending along the length of the carrier, the linear row

being inclined to the longitudinal axes of the rods (11) such that
neighbouring engagement means in said linear row co-operate with

neighbouring heald rods.
A heald control system according to claim 1 wherein a pair of
motive units (31) are provided each having selectively actuatable

engagement means engageable with each individual heald rod, one motive
unit operating 180Â° out of phase with the other unit.
A heald control system according to claim 1 or 2 wherein the
engagement means (33) for each heald rod comprises a latch member (63)

movably mounted on the associated carrier (36) and electrically actuatable 
drive means (90) also mounted on the associated carrier (36) for moving

the latch member from a first position whereat it engages the heald rod
and a second position whereat it is clear of the heald rod.
A heald control system according to claim 3 wherein the electrically
actuatable drive means comprises a piezo-electric strip (90).
A heald control system according to claim 1 or 2 wherein the
engagement means (33) for each heald rod (11) comprises a latch member

(60) movably mounted on the associated carrier (36), each latch member
(60) being caused to move by electrically actuatable drive means (70), the

electrically actuatable drive means (70) comprising an upper assembly (75)
of electromagnets (70) for co-operating with said latch member (60) when

the heald rods are at their upper shed position (US) and a lower assembly
(76) of electromagnets (70) for co-operating with said latch members (60)

when the heald rods are at their lower shed position (LS).
A heald control system according to claim 5 wherein each latch
member (60) includes a body (61) consisting of a permanent magnet

slidably mounted in its associated carrier (36).
A heald control system according to claim 5 wherein each latch
member (60) comprises a resilient rod (69) on which is mounted a

permanent magnet (68).
A heald control system according to any preceding claim wherein
the carriers (36) of each motive unit depend side by side from a common

support bar (35), each carrier (36) being connected to the support bar via
a link (39).
