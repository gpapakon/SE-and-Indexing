<CLAIMS>
A solenoid valve comprising: 

a) a vertically movable valve rod (7) carrying a closure member (9); 
b) a solenoid armature (4) supported above said closure member by said valve 
rod; and 
c) valve guiding means (11) surrounding said valve rod (7) and located between 
said armature (4) and said closure member (9), 
characterized in 
that
d) an umbrella-shaped collar (12) is provided at said valve rod (7) in a position 
between said valve guiding means (11) and said armature (14), with the outer 

diameter of said collar being essentially larger than the internal diameter of 
the valve-guiding means (11); and 
(e) the front surface of the valve-guiding means (11) facing said collar (12) is 
provided with a surrounding recess (13), which is open only in the direction 

to said colloar, whereat the diameter of its internal edge is essentially smaller 
than the outer diameter of the collar (12). 
The solenoid valve according to claim 1, 
characterized in that
 the 
internal wall (14) of said recess (13) facing said valve rod (7) is inclined from the 

upper surface of said valve guiding means (11) ) facing the collar (12) to the 
bottom (15) of the recess (13). 
The solenoid valve according to claim 1 or 2, 
characterized by
 a 
coil spring or conical spring (8) provided between said collar (12) and the 

bottom (15) of said recess (13).
