<ABSTRACT>
There is described a woven bandage which exhibits a crepe effect and which contains composite warp yarns (1) comprising a staple fibre yarn (2) and a textured filament yarn (3) twisted together. The staple fibre yarn (2) forms loops (4) which gives the bandage a crepe effect. There is also described a process for the manufacture of such woven bandages.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to bandages which exhibit a 
crepe effect and to processes for the manufacture thereof. Crepe bandages are normally used to provide light support 
and low compression for example in the treatment of sprains and 
strains and varicose veins. These bandages have sufficient 
elasticity to enable them to conform to the bandaged area and when 
secured, to allow limited movement and swelling to take place so 
that the circulation is not adversely affected. Crepe bandages 
normally comprise a woven fabric strip or tape containing high twist 
cotton warp yarns which are usually present in pairs with opposite 
twist in approximately equal numbers. These high twist warp yarns 
shrink when the woven fabric is treated for example by boiling in a 
vat to provide the bandage with elastic stretch and properties and a 
crepe appearance. However, high twist cotton yarns provide the 
bandage with a relatively harsh "feel" which can irritate sensitive 
skin areas. Furthermore, high twist cotton yarns used in 
conventional crepe bandages usually comprise in excess of 2000 
turns per metre of yarn and are thus relatively expensive to 
manufacture. US Patent No.4236550 describes a bandage which comprises 
elastic and non-elastic threads. However, the bandages described 
therein possess relatively high elasticity and are therefore not 
suitable for use as support dressings in the same manner as a 
crepe bandage. Indeed US'550 describes the disclosed dressings 
as being useful as "a fixing band". EP-A-0066072 
which represents the closest prior art 
describes a woven 
bandage which exhibits a crepe effect and which contains warp 
yarns comprising a textured yarn. The crepe effect fabrics produced 
therein are generally non-twisted, made of high count filaments and 
have high shrinkage under hot conditions. However, such fabrics 
do not possess sufficient loft or elasticity to mimic natural crepe 
bandages.  
 We have now found a woven bandage which avoids the inconveniences of 
of known bandages 
and exhibits a crepe effect.  
 According to the present invention we provide a woven 
bandage which exhibits a crepe effect and which contains textured 
filament warp yarns characterised in that the warp yarns are 
composite yarns comprising a staple fibre yarn and a textured 
filament yarn twisted together. The bandage according to the invention may comprise warp 
yarns which are only made of the aforementioned composite. 
However, in addition, cheaper and more lightweight bandages may 
be prepared by
