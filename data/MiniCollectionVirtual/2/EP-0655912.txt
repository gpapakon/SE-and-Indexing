<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a new medical use for compounds having selective agonist activity at 5-HT1-like receptors and to pharmaceutical compositions containing them. In particular it relates to a new medical use of 3-(2-(dimethylamino)ethyl)-N-methyl-1H-indole-5-methanesulphonamide and physiologically acceptable salts and solvates thereof for the treatment or prevention of elevated intraocular pressure, in particular glaucoma.

<DESCRIPTION>
MEDICAMENTS FOR THE TREATMENT OR PREVENTION OF ELEVATED INTRACULAR PRESSUREThis invention relates to a new medical use for compounds having selective agonist activity at 5-HT-| -like receptors and to pharmaceutical compositions containing them. In particular it relates to a new medical use of 3-[2-(dimethylamino)ethyl N-methyl-1 H-indole-5-methanesulphonamide and physiologically acceptable salts and solvates thereof.5-HT like receptors are located, for example, in the dog saphenous vein and the 5-HTrlike receptor agonists with which the present invention is concerned contract the dog saphenous vein. Such compounds may therefore be identified by their contractile effect on the dog isolated saphenous vein strip as described, for example, by Apperley et al.. Br. J. Pharmacol, 68, 215-224 (1980). Compounds which are selective 5-HTyiike receptor agonists have also been found to selectively constrict the carotid arterial bed of the anaesthetised dog.A variety of compounds which selectively constrict the dog isolated saphenous vein strip and which constrict the carotid arterial bed of the anaesthetised dog have been described in the art. These include indole derivatives such as those disclosed inter alia in published British Patent Specifications Nos. 2082175, 2081717, 2083463, 2124210, 2150932, 2162522, 216834?, 2168973, 2185020, 2186874, 2191488, 2208646, published European Patent Specifications Nos.147107, 237678, 242939, 244085, 225726, 254433, 303506, 313397, 354777, 382570, 464558, 506363, 506369, 450238, 451022, 451008, 478954, 438230, 494774, 497512, 501568 and published International patent application Nos. WO92/11013, W092/11014, WO92/06973, WO93/00086, W092/13856, WO93/00094, W091 /18897 and WO93/00333.The compounds disclosed in the aforementioned patent specifications have been described as useful in treating and/or preventing pain resulting from dilatation of the cranial vasculature, in particular migraine and related disorders such as cluster headache. 

We now find that such compounds are also of use in the treatment of certain ocular disorders.Glaucoma is a serious progressive clinical condition caused by an imbalance in the flow of intraocular fluids, leading to elevated intraocular pressure, optic nerve degeneration and eventual blindness. Current medical therapy for glaucoma is dominated by pharmacological agents which act by reducing the flow of fluid into the ocular chamber, for example beta blockers, and the side- effect profiles of such drugs severely limit their clinical use. Thus,

Claims
1. Use of a selective 5-HT-|-like receptor agonist or a physiologically acceptable salt or solvate thereof in the manufacture of a medicament for the treatment or prevention of elevated intraocular pressure.
2. Use as claimed in claim 1 wherein the medicament is for the treatment or prevention of glaucoma.
3. Use as claimed in claim 1 or claim 2 wherein the selective 5-HT-j-like receptor agonist is 3-[2-(dimethylamino)ethyl]-N-methyl-1 H-indole-5- methanesulphonamide or N-methyl-3-(1-methyl-4-piperidinyl)-1 H- indole-5-ethanesulphonamide.
4. Use as claimed in claim 3 wherein the selective 5-HT-|-like receptor agonist is 3-[2-(dimethylamino)ethyl]-N-meth l-1 H-indole-5- methanesulphonamide.
5. Use as claimed in any one of claims 1 to 4 wherein the medicament is adapted for oral administration.
6. Use as claimed in any one of claims 1 to 4 wherein the medicament is adapted for topical administration to the eye.
7. Use as claimed in any one of claims 1 to 6 wherein the medicament contains a unit dose of 0.1 to 300mg of a selective 5-HT-|-like receptor agonist or a physiologically acceptable salt or solvate thereof.
8. A selective 5-HT-j-like receptor agonist or a physiologically acceptable salt or solvate thereof for use in the treatment or prevention of elevated intraocular pressure.
9. A medicament for the treatment or prevention of elevated intraocular pressure comprising, as active ingredient, a selective 5-HT-|-like receptor agonist or a physiologically acceptable salt or solvate thereof. 


10. A method of treatment of a mammal, including man, suffering from or susceptible to elevated intraocular pressure which comprises administering an effective amount of a selective 5-HT-|-like receptor agonist or a physiologically acceptable salt or solvate thereof.
