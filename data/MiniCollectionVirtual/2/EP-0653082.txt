<ABSTRACT>
Electrical contact surfaces (54), especially connected to a chip (56), are designed purely functionally. According to the invention, the contact surfaces are designed in such a way that their external shape is that of a visible letter or symbol with a meaningful content. These contact surfaces may, for example, be placed on cassette casings for recognition. In a stripe or bar code unit consisting of several code components, i.e. bars, individual bars are made electrically conductive to facilitate additional coding. The electrically conductive bars or the contact surfaces are preferably connected to the terminals of an integrated circuit (56).
