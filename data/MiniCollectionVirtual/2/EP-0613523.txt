<ABSTRACT>
An electronic fuel injection system for providing variable injection timing for a compression ignition engine having a per cylinder displacement volume of at least 5.5 liters includes individual fuel delivery mechanisms, such as a fuel pump having a constant displacement fuel pumping chamber, and fuel injector for each corresponding cylinder, and has a timing signal generator, such as a multi-track optical encoder coupled to a camshaft, for generating a timing signal and a cylinder index signal. The invention also includes an electronic controller device, such as a plurality of individual controllers, which are responsive to various sensor inputs which include the timing signal and the cylinder index signal, for electronically controlling the individual fuel delivery mechanisms. The fuel delivery mechanisms are responsive to an output signal from the electronic controller device and provide a fuel flow volume range of between 100-1600 mm3/stroke over a fuel injection pression range of between approximately 10-20 k.p.s.i. to a corresponding fuel injector. Each fuel delivery mechanism has an electronically controlled solenoid valve responsive to an output signal, in conjunction with a shuttle valve in fluid communication with the solenoid, which provide a high spill fuel volume from the constant displacement fuel pumping chamber.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates generally to electronic 
fuel control systems for compression ignition 
engines, and more particularly to fuel injection 
control systems for compression ignition engines 
having cylinders with large displacement volumes 
such as locomotive or marine type engines. Currently, no variable injection timing systems 
for diesel locomotive engines are known. Known 
locomotive engines typically have fixed injection 
timing through a governor and mechanical linkages 
which actuate a series of fuel delivery devices 
simultaneously. Fuel amounts and/or timing of fuel 
injection are generally predetermined for any given 
engine operating point and typically cannot be 
modified for varying conditions. Fuel delivery 
systems may include pump-line-nozzle configurations 
or unit injection configurations. Strict emission requirements will soon be 
imposed on the locomotive engine industry to reduce 
exhaust fuel emissions to suitable levels. Although 
electronic fuel control systems for reducing fuel 
emissions have been developed for diesel truck 
engines, these types of systems are generally not 
suited to the unique designs of much larger diesel 
engines. For example, the single cylinder displacement 
for a large sixteen cylinder locomotive diesel 
engine may be on the order of 11 liters whereas the 
single cylinder displacement for a typical diesel 
truck may be on the order of only 2 liters per 
cylinder. Therefore a single cylinder for a large  
 
locomotive engine may easily be more than five times 
larger than that of a large diesel truck. This 
generally translates into very different design 
constraints since high injection pressure levels (on 
the order of 10-20 k.p.s.i.) are required in 
conjunction with much higher volume fuel flow rate 
ranges (100-1600 mm3/stroke) to effectuate proper 
combustion in the larger locomotive engine. A problem arises with such large engines since 
both low fuel volume demand conditions, such as 
during idle (on the order of 100 mm3/stroke), and 
high volume demand conditions (on the order of 1600 
mm3/stroke) must be accommodated during normal 
operating conditions. Therefore the fuel delivery 
system must be capable of providing a wide range of 
fuel flow volumes at high injection pressures. 
Accommodating such requirements becomes increasingly 
difficult where the fuel delivery mechanisms use a 
constant displacement type system as known in the 
art. These systems typically fill a pumping chamber 
with the same amount of fuel irrespective of the 
actual
