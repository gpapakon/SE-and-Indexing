a string of tubing 31 is passed through a string of 

pipe 24 to a location within an inflatable packer 19. 
The inflation tool is located within the packer by a 

locating means 26 of the tool cooperating with a 
locating means 27 of the packer. The packer includes 

an inflation valve 36 for admitting inflation fluid to 
the packer and the tool includes a valve means 38 for 

controlling flow of inflation fluid to the packer.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to method and apparatuses for inflating an
inflatable packer. More particularly, the invention has a specific application to
systems for selectively injecting liquid cement slurry or a liquid mud in a string
of tubing into an inflatable packer device in both a vertical and horizontal or
non-vertical well bore for inflating the packer device.Horizontal drilling of well bores is a relatively recent technology where
an initial segment of a well bore extends in a generally vertical direction and
then is angled in a direction which can be normal to a vertical or with other
angular relationships with respect to the initial vertical segment of the well
bore. Where a horizontal or non-vertical section of the well bore traverses
earth formations which contain hydrocarbons it is desirable to isolate selected
formations from one another along a segment of the well bore from other
sections along the well bore.A practical system for obtaining a cement type sealing mechanism in
the annulus between a well pipe and a well bore in horizontal or non-vertical
sections of a well bore is thus desirable.In US Patent 5,082,062 and EP-A-0502133 a system is disclosed
where an inflatable packer in a string of pipe has a latching profile. An
actuating tool carried on a string of tubing is receivable in the inflatable packer
and is mechanically arranged to have latching fingers for selectively engaging
the latching profile so that downward motion on the string of tubing can be
used to set the inflation tool in the inflatable packer and permit use of cement
or mud slurry to inflate the inflatable packer. This system has a certain
mechanical complexity and requires the latching profile to be located below the
inflatable packer and uses weight set packing elements.Where multiple inflatable packers with different lengths are utilized, the
location of a latching profile above the packer permits a single tool to be
uniformly applicable in actuating the packers because the profile and actuating
valve can be uniformly spaced irrespective of the length of the packer. Also
the tool is considerably shorter which is always an advantage. US-A-5012871 discloses positioning a straddle assembly in a sliding
sleeve valve using a locking key on the straddle assembly which locates in
grooves in an upper housing of the valve. The valve is connected between two
well tubing sections, the assembled valve and tubing being positioned inside a
casing in a well bore. Packers are disclosed extending between outer surfaces
of the well

<CLAIMS>
A method for inflating an inflatable packer (19, 20, 21) in a well bore
where the inflatable packer is on a string of pipe (22, 23, 24) in the well bore

and is inflatable in response to an inflation liquid being admitted through a
pressure inflation valve (36) in the inflatable packer (19, 20, 21), said method

comprising the steps of:

lowering an inflation tool (30) on a string of tubing (31) to a location
within the inflatable packer (19, 20, 21);
sealing off the pressure inflation valve (36) to said inflatable packer
(19, 20, 21);
coupling the inflation tool (30) to said inflatable packer (19, 20, 21) to
prevent movement by locking drag elements (26) on the well tool (30) in a

profile recess in the upper end of said inflatable packer (19, 20, 21) so that
manipulation of the string of tubing (31) can be used to operate a flow valve

(38) in said inflation tool (30);
opening the flow valve (38) in said inflation tool by a longitudinal
movement of the string of tubing (31) and supplying an inflation liquid through

said string of tubing (31) to said flow valve (38) in said inflation tool (30) to
the pressure inflation valve (36) in said inflatable packer (19, 20, 21); 
after inflating said inflatable packer (19, 20, 21), closing the flow valve
(38) in said inflation tool (30) by a reciprocating movement of said string of

tubing (31); and
uncoupling the inflation tool (30) from said inflatable packer (19, 20,
21) so that said inflation tool (30) can be moved with the string of tubing (31)

to another location.

members (32, 34), and the well tool (30) has an open bore while going in the
well bore, and after locating the well tool (30) in the inflatable packer (19, 20,

21), the further step is performed of dropping a first plug member (74) into the
string of tubing (31) and applying pressure to liquid in the string of tubing

behind the first plug member (74) while the flow valve (38) in the inflation tool
(30) is open and the first plug member (74) closes off the open bore to test the

integrity of the sealing of the cup members (32, 34) in the inflatable packer
(19, 20, 21).
A method as claimed in claim 2 wherein the first plug member (74) is
removed from the bore of the well tool (30) and a second plug member (86)

follows the inflation liquid and closes off the bore in the well tool (30).

liquid cement slurry.
A method as claimed in any one of the preceding claims wherein the
inflation tool (30) is moved in the well bore to another inflatable packer
