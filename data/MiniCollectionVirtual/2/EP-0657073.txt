<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a method and an arrangement in mobile telecommunications systems comprising, on the one hand, one or more cells operating with channels/frequencies, which cells belong to one or more base stations, and, on the other, one or more first and second mobile units, for producing one or more first representations of traffic intensity within one or more geographic areas. One or more second mobile units are provided with elements for measuring and evaluating signal strength. The measurements are carried out at a number of geographic positions on transmission from one or more first mobile units to a base station. In those cases where the said signal strength exceeds a predetermined value, this value is stored, together with information on frequencies and geographic positions. One or more second representations of the traffic intensity in a respective geographic position are established in dependence on the number of stored values which have been obtained when measuring at the said geographic positions. The said first representation of the traffic intensity within a respective geographic area is produced in dependence on the second representations compiled in the measuring and storing elements, whereby the said first representation provides for improved cell planning by forming a better basis for cell planning.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method and an
arrangement in mobile telecommunications systems which
operate with channels/frequencies. These mobile telecommunications
systems usually comprise, on the one hand, a
number of base stations operating with channels/
frequencies, which stations are connected to one or more
mobile telephone exchanges, constituting a network
system, and, on the other, of a number of mobile units.
The mobile telecommunications system operates with a
large number of channels/frequencies. As an example, the
NMT system can be mentioned in which several hundred
channels/frequencies are used. In areas with high
traffic, however, this number of channels/frequencies is
not sufficient. These areas are therefore provided with
so-called microcell technology. Microcell technology
involves a reduction in the size of the cells. That is to
say, the output power is reduced, which leads to it being
possible to reduce the distance to base stations with the
same channel/frequency. The result is that the channels
can be utilised in a more efficient way. The number of
channels/frequencies which are allocated to an affected
base station is related to the degree of utilisation of
the base station. In addition, the method and arrangement
are of the type which utilises elements for measuring and
evaluating the signal strength which is transmitted from
one or more mobile units.It has already been known to carry out measurements
of the traffic loading within the coverage area of
a base station, here called a cell. The measurement
values which have been obtained in association with these
measurements provide a conception of a total traffic 
loading within the cell of the affected base station. The
measurement values have not provided any conception of
how the traffic is then distributed within the cell of
the affected base station.GB 2236457 discloses a method for cell planning, but is focused on
determining the degree of coverage in a mobile radio system. According to the
method of that document, field strength from the base stations is measured and
compared with a predetermined coverage limit value.It is charactacistic of these measurements that
they have been carried out at an affected base station
from the mobile telephone exchange side to the mobile
unit side. These measurements have not provided a
satisfactory basis for cell planning in mobile telecommunications
systems.Today's mobile telecommunications systems
presuppose accurata cell planning in association with
setting up new base stations or

A method for a mobile telecommunications system comprising base
stations (1, 1', 1") having respective coverage areas, cells, (2, 2', 2"), and first

mobile units (4, 4', 4") devised to communicate with said base stations within the
respective cells using frequencies within a frequency band, the method being used

for cell planning within a geographic area by measuring signals strength at
geographic positions withi
n the geographic area by means of measuring and
evaluating elements which are included in one or more second mobile units, and

comparing them with threshold values, 
characterised by
 the steps of

setting the level for said threshold value according to the size of a part area
around the geographic position to be measured, which value can be varied;
measuring the strength of the signals coming from one or more first mobile units
on all of said frequencies within the frequency band;
storing, for each frequency at which the measured signal strength exceeds said
threshold value, the geographic position where the measurement was obtained,

along with said threshold value and said frequency;
generating, for part-areas at each of said geographic positions, second
representations (11) of the system's traffic loading, in dependence on the number

of measurements exceeding the threshold value at the respective position;
generating a first visual representation (10), composed of a number of second
representations compiled in the measuring and storing elements, of the traffic

loading for said geographic area, the number of second representations being a
factor in determining the geographic resolution for said first representation.
The method as recited in claim 1, in which the size of such a part-area
is determined by the threshold level used;
The method as recited in claim 1 or 2, in which signal strength is
measured at a geographic position at one or more time points, and that a mean value

of the traffic loading is produced from the values which have been stored at said
time points for the respective geographic position, that said mean value is used to

generate said second representations for the affected geographic position.
The method as recited in any of the preceding claims, in which the
number of calls in progress in the said part-area is directly related to the number of

stored values.

means for measuring the signal strength of one or more first mobile units on all
of said frequencies in the frequency band;
means for storing, for measurements exceeding the threshold value, the
geographic position at which the measurement was obtained, the frequency of

the measured signal and the threshold value;
means for setting the level for said threshold value according to the size of a part
area around the geographic position to be measured, and for varying the level of

said threshold;
