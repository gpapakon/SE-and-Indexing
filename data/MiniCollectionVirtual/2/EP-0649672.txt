<ABSTRACT>
The ball trough is of a unitary construction such that 
it is mounted directly to the underside of the playfield as a 

single piece. The ball trough consists of a generally U-shaped 
channel that is mounted to the underside of the playfield and 

extends between the drain hole and the shooter lane. The bottom 
surface of the channel is inclined relative to the horizontal 

such that a ball entering at the drain hole will roll under the 
force of gravity toward the shooter lane. When activated, the 

solenoid plunger will kick the ball located adjacent the shooter 
lane up through an aperture in the playfield and into the shooter 

lane. A series of optical switches are mounted on the channel 
and arranged such that each switch will detect the presence or 

absence of the ball in the queue.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates, generally, to pinball games and,
more particularly, to an improved ball trough for such games.Pinball games typically consist of an inclined
playfield supporting a plurality of play features such as
targets, ramps, bumpers and the like. Player controlled flippers
are pivotably mounted on the playfield near the bottom thereof.
The player manipulates the flippers to direct the ball at
selected play features thereby to control play of the game and
score points.To begin play of the game typically the player
manipulates a spring loaded plunger that propels the ball up a
shooter lane and onto the playfield. Play continues until the
ball drains from the playfield via a drain hole. In the typical
pinball game the drain hole is located behind the flippers such
that if the player misplays the ball it will roll between the
flippers into the drain hole and exit the playfield to terminate
play of that ball. As will be appreciated, the player is usually
provided with three, four or even five balls per game. Thus,
when one ball drains from the playfield another ball will be
loaded into the shooter lane. Located in the playfield, out of sight of the player,
is a ball trough. The ball trough extends from the drain hole to
the shooter lane and is the mechanism by which the balls are
retrieved from the drain hole and delivered to the shooter lane.The prior art ball trough is a multicomponent assembly
that must be assembled on the playfield during the manufacture of
the game. Referring to Figures 1-3, the assembly consists of a
cutout 1 in the playfield 3 in which base member 5 is fixed.
Base member 5 includes a central aperture 7 that defines a pair
of rails 9a and 9b on which the ball rides. Base member 5 is
formed as a ramp with a peak in the middle thereof (best shown in
Figure 3) such that a ball does not freely roll from the inlet
end 11 to the outlet end 13.A substantially v-shaped rail 15 is secured to the top
of playfield 3 and forms one side rail of the ball trough and
Straight rail 17, also secured to the top of playfield 3, forms
the opposite side rail for the ball trough.Located at inlet end 11 is a first mechanical (leaf)
switch 19 that provides a signal to the game microprocessor
indicating that a ball has entered the ball trough. Four
additional mechanical switches 21, 23, 25 and 27 are provided
between switch 19 and outlet end 13 and are arranged such that 
each switch will detect the presence or absence of balls queued
on base member 5.Mounted to the playfield adjacent the inlet end

<CLAIMS>
In combination a pinball game having an inclined playfield (10) supporting a
rolling ball (34), a plurality of play features, a shooter lane (8) for putting a ball (34)

in play and a drain hole (6) allowing the ball (34) to exit the playfield (10), and a ball
trough (2), said ball trough (2) comprising:


a channel (4) fixed to the playfield (10) and having a first end (20) adjacent the drain
hole (6) and a second end (22) adjacent the shooter lane (8), said channel (4) having a

surface (18) adapted for supporting a row (49) of balls (34) thereon and positioned to
cause the balls (34) to roll from the first end (20) to the second end (22) by force of

gravity;
kicker means (26, 28) mounted proximate to said second end (22) for kicking a ball
(34) out of the channel (4) onto the playfield (10);
means (36) for guiding the kicked ball (34) from the channel (4) to the shooter lane
(8); and
means (52, 54) for detecting the presence or absence of a ball (34) in said channel (4)
comprising a switch positioned to sense a ball (34); characterised in that
said means for detecting (52, 54) comprises a plurality of optical switches (52, 54)
arranged along the length of the channel (4), each of said plurality of optical switches

(52, 54) being positioned to sense one of said balls (34) of said row of balls (49).
The combination of claim 1, wherein each
of said plurality of

optical switches (52, 54) comprises
a light emitter (52) and a light receptor (54) mounted opposite one another on either 

side of the channel (4), each light emitter (52) and light receptor (54) being aligned
with an aperture (46, 48) in a respective side (14, 16) of the channel (4).
The combination of claim 1 or claim 2, wherein the surface (18) of the ball
trough (2) includes means (32) for centering balls (34) in said channel (4).
The combination of claim 3, wherein said means (32) for centering includes a
groove (32) formed along the length of the channel (4).
The combination of any preceding claim, wherein said channel (4) is fixed to
the underside of the playfield (10).
The combination of any preceding claim, wherein said kicker means (26,28)
includes a solenoid (26) having a reciprocating plunger (28), the solenoid (26)

mounted to the channel (4) such that the plunger (28) can extend through an aperture
(32) formed in the channel (4) to contact a ball (34) located at said second end (22).
The combination of any preceding claim, wherein said means (36) for guiding
extends through said playfield (10).
The combination of any preceding claim, wherein the kicker means (26, 28) is
a solenoid (26) mounted below said channel (4), said solenoid (26) including a

plunger (28) which is projected outwardly to strike the ball (34) when the solenoid
(26) is activated thereby to propel said ball (34) from said channel (4), said plunger

(28) positioned in line with the initial path of the ball (34) after being struck by the
plunger (28).
The combination of any preceding claim, further including means (53) for
detecting the misfiring of the kicker means (26, 28) and for automatically refiring the

kicker means (26, 28) to eject a ball (34).
