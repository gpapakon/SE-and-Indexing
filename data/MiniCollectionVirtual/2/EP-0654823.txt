<ABSTRACT>
An electrostatic discharge (hereafter referred to as 
"ESD") protection device (46) is disclosed for use with 

semiconductor chip packaging (hereafter referred to as 
"SCP"). The electrostatic protection device comprises 

electrically conductive shorting devices (50) that may be 
removably connected to the SCP (12) during the manufacture 

to short selected pins (22,24) from the SCP. The ESD 
protection device (46) remains in place to provide ESD 

protection during all phases of handling and shipping and 
may be either automatically unshorted or be manually 

removed during final assembly when the SCP is installed in 
its end product.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to an electrostatic discharge
(hereafter referred to as "ESD") protection device for
various semiconductor chip packages (hereinafter referred
to as "SCP") of the type having a plurality of connector
pins which are either (a) continuously shorted and then,
upon insertion of the connector pins into complementary
receptacles, automatically unshorted or (b) continuously
shorted until the physical removal of the ESD protection
device from the SCP.For a plurality of connector pins of a SCP which mates
with a corresponding plurality of receptacles in a
connector, typically, a printed circuit board, it is
frequently necessary to short together the connector pins
of the SCP until they are inserted into complementary
receptacles in the connector in order to protect the
semiconductor's circuity from ESD. Present ESD protection
devices consist primarily of ESD packaging of the SCP in
electrically conductive strips, pellets, boxes and plastic
tubing which provides effective ESD protection until the
user is about to insert the connector pins of the SCP into
the complementary receptacles in the connector. At that
point, however, the user must remove this ESD packaging
from the SCP, thus rendering the SCP vulnerable to ESD, in
order to position and insert the connector pins into the
receptacles. Accordingly, as the user inserts the
connector pins of the SCP into the receptacles, the
semiconductor dies housed within these SCP's could be
destroyed by ESD and would have to be replaced. Moreover,
certain types of SCPs typically EPROMs, UVPROMS, and DRAMs,
are plug-in devices which have connector pins which are
repeatedly inserted into and then removed from the
receptacles. These types of SCPs require ESD protection
during the repeated insertions into and removals from the
receptacles. Specifically, the connector pins of these
SCPs require ESD protection from the moment that their
connector pins are removed from the receptacles till their 
connector pins are again inserted therein. Consequently,
a need still exists within the semiconductor chip packaging
industry for a true ESD protection device, rather than ESD
packaging, which effectively protects the semiconductor die
from ESD until the connector pins of the SCP are inserted
into the receptacles of the connector and then protects the
semiconductor die from ESD again when the connector pins
are removed form their respective receptacles.Navy Technical Disclosure Bulletin, vol.6, no.3, March 1981, p.33-36, discloses a device for
protecting a SCP from

<CLAIMS>
An electrostatic discharge protection device (46) in
combination with a semiconductor chip package (12) of the

type having a top surface (14) and opposite bottom surface
(16) and a pair of interface surfaces (18,20) disposed

between the top and bottom surfaces, each interface surface
having a plurality of connector pins (22,24) disposed

thereon in a substantially parallel and spaced apart
relationship with respect to each other, each connector pin

having a portion extending outward from the interface
surface and downward at its distal end so as to extend

beyond the bottom surface, the electrostatic discharge
protection device including a base section (48) secured to the semiconductor chip package and a plurality of shorting arms (50) integral to the base section, each shorting arm being in

electrical engagement with a respective connector pin for shorting
between the plurality of connector pins via the shorting

arms and the base section, each shorting
arm further including means for yieldably biasing each

shorting arm so as to urge the distal end portion thereof
against its respective ones of the connector pins thereby

creating an electrical connection therebetween, the protection device being characterised in that:


a) said base section (48) is secured to the bottom surface
of the semiconductor chip package; and
b) said shorting arms (50) extend outward from the base section with the distal
end portions (52) in spaced apart relationship with respect

to each other and transversely disposed with respect to the
plurality of connector pins, each shorting arm comprising a

first portion (54) fixedly secured to the base section and
extending outwardly from the bottom surface, a knee portion

(56) extending from the first portion to define a bend in
the shorting arm, and an intermediate portion (58)

extending from the bend towards at least one of the
connector pins so that the distal end portion extends over

the respective ones of the connector pins.
A device according to claim 1, characterised by an
adhesive for securely mounting the base section to the

semiconductor chip package.
A device according to claim 1, characterised by end
portions extending from opposite ends of the base section

and integral therewith, each end portion defining a clip
(60,62) which can be removably secured around the top and

bottom surfaces of the semiconductor chip package so that
the base section is securely mounted to the semiconductor

chip package.
An electrostatic discharge protection device according
to any of the preceding claims in combination with a connector (38) including a plurality of receptacles (44) for receiving said plurality of connector pins (22, 24) of said semiconductor chip package (12), wherein the shorting arms

and the connector (38) are constructed so that the shorting arms (50) automatically move out of
engagement with the plurality of connector pins (22,24)

when the plurality of connector pins (22,24) are inserted
into said receptacles (44).
