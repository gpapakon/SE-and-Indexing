<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates generally to the field of implantable prosthetic systems for 
overcoming male erectile impotence and more specifically to 
a penile prosthesis having a unique inflation valve assembly and concomitant improved 
means for inflating and deflating said prosthesis. A number of devices are available for enabling those with erectile impotency to 
achieve an erection. These devices are generally implanted within the corpus 
cavernosum of the penis. Normally two such devices are utilized, one implanted into 
each corpus cavernosum. Generally speaking, the penile prostheses which are 
available, or which have been described, include a reservoir, a pump and a pressure 
chamber. Fluid is pumped from the reservoir by the pump to the pressure chamber to 
achieve an erection. Illustrative of the early devices are those disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 
3,853,122 to Strauch, et al., which discloses an external pump and a single tube and 
valve mechanism, and U.S. Pat. No. 3,954,102 to Buuck, et al. which discloses a device 
located in the scrotum and 
manually operated through the use of bypass valve means. Further illustrative of the devices available is that disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 
4,590,927 to Porter and Kuyaya. This patent relates to a unitary penile prosthesis which 
comprises a tubular enclosure having a distal portion which includes a pump, a medial 
portion including a pressurizable chamber which contains an internal tubular, 
substantially non-distensible portion and a concentric tubular sleeve, and a proximal 
portion defining a fluid reservoir therewithin. The non-distensible portion of the 
pressurizable chamber is typically crimped so that it may expand in diameter. The 
tubular sleeve may elastically bias the non-distensible portion to its flaccid state. A 
passageway fluidically connects the reservoir and the pump and is in fluid isolation from 
the pressurizable chamber of the medal portion. In U.S. 5010882 to Polyak and Pugh there is described an implantable penile 
prosthesis employing a unique deflation valve mechanism which provides an improved 
means for returning the prosthesis from the erect to the flaccid state. In its preferred 
embodiment, the prosthesis of the patent is of a unitary type in which the pump bulb, 
reservoir, pressurizable chamber, and inflation and deflation valves are in a self-contained 
unit which is inserted into the corpus cavernosum.  
 While unitary penile prosthetic devices have distinct advantages, and have 
achieved substantial success and

flow from the pump bulb to the pressurizable chamber, from the reservoir back to the 
pump bulb, and back again to the pressurizable chamber until the latter is filled to 

capacity causing the prosthesis to assume the erect state. 
A penile prosthesis according to claim 1, wherein said means of said 
inflation assembly comprises normally tightly fitting but distensible sleeves (94), (46),

cavernosum of the penis said tubular closure comprising:
