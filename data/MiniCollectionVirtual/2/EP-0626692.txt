<ABSTRACT>
A transport and storage cover for flat, brittle objects, 
such as compact discs and data diskettes, incorporating a 

comparatively shape stiff, multi-layer plate (15), which in 
one of its flat sides is provided with an opening (7,4) with 

an outer dimension and shape (7) substantially corresponding 
to the outer dimension and shape of an object (16) intended 

to be positioned in said opening, the depth of the opening 
(7,4) being substantially equal to the thickness of an 

object, that the inner part of the opening (4) is congruent 
with the outer part of the opening (7) but is somewhat 

bigger than this, and that at the outer part of the opening 
(7) there is at least one tab (8) or flap (9) projecting 

inwards, and adapted to contribute to the retainment of the 
object positioned in the opening.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention refers to a transport and storage cover for 
flat, fragile objects, such as compact discs and data 
diskettes and also to method for manufacturing such covers. With the ever increasing datorization of the society the 
number of data diskettes to be handled is also increased. Handling of compact discs for music recordings, information 
storage and the like, is also increasing in the smae manner. Such diskettes and discs are rather sensible to outer 
damage, and at data diskettes particularly in the area of 
the "shutter", i.e. the movable metal cover, which protects 
the aperture in the plastic housing of the diskette, and 
discs and diskettes therefore should be handled thus that 
they will not be cracked or damaged in other way by impacts 
or pressure. With the increasing demand of conveyance of such discs and 
diskettes there is a requirement for an appropriate 
transport package, whereby earlier used padded envelopes and 
blister packs certainly give a rather good protection, but 
are comparatively bulky and furthermore allow disc, diskette 
or diskettes to move within the package, which is less 
desirable. Particularly within modern postal handling with 
franking machines it is of utmost importance that the parcel 
is completely planar, as otherwise the machines can not 
produce correct prints. If the object in the parcel is not 
positioned in an accurately defined position there is 
furthermore a big risk that the franking machine, at its 
hard impact against the envelope surface, will tear up the 
envelope surface, if the stamp hits the edge of the object,  
 
which means that disc or diskette may fall out of the parcel 
whereupon it in many occasions can not be delivered to the 
correct addressee. Furthermore it is important that the parcel is not bent, and 
finally it is essential that static electricity is not 
generated in the parcel, as this might result in demagnetizing 
of a data diskette. The risk for generation of 
static electricity is evident with a plastic diskette, which 
can move in the parcel. Data diskettes earlier have been stored, to a large extent, 
in especially manufactured register boxes, but there is also 
a need for a storage system, which can be combined with 
conventional storage folders and ring binders or the like. 
There are similar needs for compact discs. The purpose of the present invention is to provide a simple 
and inexpensive but at the same time efficient cover for 
flat or planar objects, such as compact discs and data 
diskettes, which can be

<CLAIMS>
A transport and storage cover for flat objects, such as 
compact discs and data diskettes,characterized therein, 

that it incorporates a comparatively shape stiff, multilayer 
plate (15), which in one of its flat sides is provided 

with an opening (7,4;21) with an outer dimension and shape 
(7;21) substantially corresponding to the outer dimension 

and shape of an object (16) intended to be positioned in 
said opening, the depth of the opening (7,4;21) being 

substantially equal to the thickness of an object, that the 
inner part of the opening (4) is congruent with the outer 

part of the opening (7) but is somewhat bigger than this, 
and that at the outer part of the opening (7;21) there is at 

least one tab (8) or flap (9;22) projecting inwards, and 
adapted to contribute to the retainment of the object 

positioned in the opening. 
A cover according to claim 1,characterizedtherein, 
that the material in the plate (15) consists of a number of 

layers (1a,1b,1c) of corrugated fibreboard, whereby the 
outer opening (7;21) extends through one of the layers (1c), 

whereas the inner part of the opening (4) extends through 
another layer (1a). 
A cover according to claim 2,characterized therein, 
that the layers (1a,1b,1c) of the plate (15) consist of a 

continuous disc (1), which is folded to multi layer form 
with a number of mutually substantially parallel folding 

lines (12). 
A cover as claimed in claim 3,characterized therein, 
that the flute tops (2) of the corrugated fibreboard extend 

essentially perpendicularly to the folding lines between 
said layers (1a,1b,1c). 
A cover according to claim 4,characterizedtherein, 
that the folding lines are constituted by bands (12) of 

crushed portions of the flute tops of the corrugated 
fibreboard, made perpendicular to the extension of the flute 

tops. 
A cover as claimed in anyone of claims 2-5,characterizedtherein, 
that the tab (8) projecting into the opening, on its side 

turned inwards, is provided with a thinner portion (13), 
situated at the outer part of the tab and constituted by 

crushed portions of the flute tops (2) of the corrugated 
fibreboard. 
A cover as claimed in anyone of claims 2-6,characterizedtherein, 
that the portion (1c) carrying the tab (8) is provided with 

a thinner material portion (14) immediately below said tab, 
and in form of crushed portions of the flute tops (2) of the 

corrugated fibreboards, said thinner material portion having 
a height corresponding to the distance between the adjacent 

edge of the opening (7) in this portion (1c) and the 
adjacent edge of the opening (4) in the first portion (1a). 
A cover as claimed in anyone of the preceeding claims,characterizedtherein, 
that the layer (1b) or layers situated behind the two cover 

layers (1a,1c) equipped with openings (4,7;21), is/are 
equipped with a through-hole (11;22) for allowing simple 

removal of the object from the cover. 
A method for manufacturing transport and storage covers 
according to claim 1,characterizedtherein, 

that the cover is manufactured from a planar disc of 
corrugated fibreboard (1) by being given in a single 

punching operation a number of through-punchings 
(4,7,11,5,6,10) arranged in continous portions (1a,1b,1c) 

separated by folding lines, 
that during the punching operation by means of crushing 

members inserted in the blanking tool at the same time is 
made portions (12,13,14) of crushed flute tops of the 

corrugated fibreboard, some of which portions are made as 
elongated bands (12) forming said folding lines, 

that the corrugated fibreboard disc (1), which is subdivided 
in portions (1a,1b,1c) by said folding lines, are provided 

with adhesive, and 
that the corrugated fibreboard disc (1) thereupon is folded 

to a multilayer form along said folding lines, and is 
compressed until said adhesive has been cured and thereby 

causes the layers (1a,1b,1c) to be held together to a cover 
(15).
