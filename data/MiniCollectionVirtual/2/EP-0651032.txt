<ABSTRACT>
Herein disclosed are a filler surface modifier which 
comprises a phosphoric ester and/or pyrophosphoric ester having 

a substituent group with a terminal double bond, a filler 
treated with such a surface modifier, and an unsaturated 

polyester resin composition and an acrylic resin composition 
blended with such a surface-treated filler. Such a filler 

surface modifier eventually not only can increase strength of, 
namely, provide rigidity for, unsaturated polyester resins 

filled with CaCO₃ and the like fillers and acrylic resins filled 
with Al(OH)₃ and the like fillers, but also can reduce viscosity 

of such resins before curing, thus resulting in improved 
processability and high filling capacity.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a surface modifier which can 
improve processability and rigidity of filler-filled unsaturated 
polyesters and filler-filled acrylic resins. Titanate-based, aluminium-based, silane-based, phosphoric 
acid-based, and the like surface modifier have been used as an 
additive to the system of an inorganic filler and an organic 
matrix. Of these, the titanate-, aluminium-, and phosphoric 
acid-based surface modifiers are mainly used as a viscosity 
reducing agent and a high filling agent with a view to improving 
pre-curing workability, and the silane-based one is used as a 
rigidity providing agent in order to improve physical properties 
after curing. With respect to thermosetting resins as the 
organic matrix, however, there have been known no applicable 
surface modifiers which have simultaneously the required 
characteristics of both kinds of surface modifiers. Actually, 
there are many systems including unsaturated polyesters which 
systems require viscosity reduction and rigidity provision. 
Phosphoric acid-based surface modifiers have been disclosed in 
Japanese Patent Application Laid-Open (Kokai) No. Sho 57-108164, 
Japanese Patent Application Laid-Open (Kokai) No. Sho 59-170131 
and Japanese Patent Application Laid-Open (Kokai) No. Hei 3-103413, 
but they were not satisfactory in terms of the reduction  
 
of viscosity and provision of strength (rigidity) in organic 
matrices. Accordingly, an object of the present invention is to 
provide a surface modifier which can show a viscosity reducing 
effect when a filler is filled in thermosetting resins, 
especially unsaturated polyester resins and acrylic resins, and 
also can provide the resulting moldings with rigidity. The present invention thus provides filler surface 
modifiers which satisfy the above object of the invention and 
other objects which will become apparent from the description of 
the invention given hereinbelow. In an aspect of the present invention, there is provided a 
filler surface modifier which comprises phosphoric esters and/or 
pyrophosphoric esters having substituent groups with a terminal 
double bond. In another aspect of the present invention, there is 
provided a filler surface-treated with such a surface modifier. In a third aspect of the present invention, there is 
provided an unsaturated polyester resin composition or an 
acrylic resin composition, each blended with such a surface-treated 
filler. And, in a fourth aspect of the invention, there are 
provided some novel compounds which can
