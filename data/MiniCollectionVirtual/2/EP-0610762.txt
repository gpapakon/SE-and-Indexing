<ABSTRACT>
The present invention discloses a planishing method for 
jo
ined sheets made of a thermoplastic material. Welded ends (38) 
of the plastic sheets (28,30) are placed between two platens (22,24). The 

platens are heated to raise the temperature of the plastic 
material a sufficient amount to soften the plastic material 

without disturbing its molecular structure. The platens are 
pressed together with a sufficient pressure while applying 

heat until the sheets are pressed together providing a 
relatively smooth, continuous joint having a thickness similar 

to the thickness of a single sheet. Finally, the platens are 
cooled thereby cooling the joined sheets.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention is generally directed to a method for
smoothing an existing joint between adjacent thermoplastic
sheets. More particularly, the invention contemplates
smoothing a joint between sheets which may then be further
processed.Conventional techniques, such as hot knife welding, to
join two sheets of plastic together have provided an unequal
sheet thickness at the joint. In a hot knife welding
technique, the ends of the sheets are placed in an overlapping
relationship. A conventional hot knife is then used to form a
splice by fusing the two ends together. Thereafter, the fused
sheet is further processed such as, for example, by slitting
into individual straps for use in strapping applications.The hot knife welding technique creates a non-planar
joint between the two sheets at the splice. This non-planar
joint must be manually knife scraped or otherwise mechanically
worked to smooth out and to lessen the overall weld thickness
to a predetermined specification value in order to satisfy PSM
clearances.The present invention is intended to overcome or minimize
all of these problems, as well as to present several other
improvements. From CH-A-291 255 it is known to join the ends of recording
tapes being composed in the main of hot deformable
synthetic material by welding together the overlapped ends
under pressure and heat which is yielding a reduced
thickness of the overlapping area. This weld joint requires
such high temperatures that the molecular orientation of
the synthetic material and hence the strength of the joint
are influenced unfavourably. Nearly the same procedure for
the opposite ends of webs of thermoplastic covering
material, especially high molecular weight, high viscosity
materials such as fluorinated ethylene polymers (e.g.
Teflon FEP), is disclosed in US-A-3 707 428. A general object of the present invention is to provide
an improved method for reducing thickness and smoothing a weld
for joining plastic sheets.Another object of the present invention is to provide a
smooth joint of plastic sheets by using a planishing method.It is a further object of the present invention to
provide an improved method of smoothing a joint between two
plastic sheets that eliminates the need for manual knife
scraping of the joint.A specific object of the present invention is to provide
an improved method for smoothing a joint between two plastic
sheets that does not disturb the molecular orientation of the
plastic material during the planishing process.Briefly, and in accordance with the foregoing,

<CLAIMS>
A method of planishing a welded joint of pre-welded end
portions of thermoplastic material sheets (28, 30) having a

predetermined thickness and generally parallel molecular
orientation, said welded joint having a first length and a

double thickness of material, said method comprising:

heating and pressing said welded joint area (40) for softening
the thermoplastic material and flowing said thermoplastic

material for reducing said double thickness and increasing
the length of said welded joint area, said heating being

insufficient to materially disrupt the molecular
orientation of the thermoplastic material.
A method as defined in claim 1, which includes cooling

the welded joint area (40) after the double thickness has been
reduced while maintaining pressure on said welded joint

area.
A method as defined in claim 1 or 2, wherein platens (22, 24) for
heating and pressing the welded joint are electrically

heated at a temperature between 135째C (275째F) to 162,7째C (325째F).
A method as defined in any one of the claims 1 to 3,
wherein platens (22, 24) for heating and pressing the welded joint

are applied at a pressure between 9.07 x 10
3
 kg (10 ton) to 1.81 x 10
4
 kg (20 ton).
A method as defined in any one of the claims 1 to 4,
wherein the heat and pressure are applied to the platens (22, 24) 

for a predetermined amount of time which is between 15
seconds and 60 seconds.
A method as defined in any one of the claims 1 to 5,
wherein a step of cooling includes cycling water through

the platens (22, 24) and cycling air through the platens.
A method as defined in any one of the claims 1 to 6,
wherein the sheet material is polypropylene.
