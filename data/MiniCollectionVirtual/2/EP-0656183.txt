<ABSTRACT>
A patient care system comprises a bed including an 
inflatable mattress supported on a platform of 

articulatable links by a support system mounted on a 
weigh frame. The platform (822) is configured to 

support a person and includes first and second panels 
(824, 826) having respective upwardly facing support 

surfaces and adjacent edges (824a, 826a), and means 
(828) for varying the angle of said first panel (824) 

relative to said second panel (826) and changing the 
distance between said respective adjacent edges (824a, 

826a) of said first and second panels (824, 826).

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates generally to beds, and more
particularly, to a bed and associated features
facilitating care of a patient supported on the bed.Hospital bed designs have recently been undergoing
a transformation. Early beds were very basic devices
providing limited patient support and care features.
More recently, bed designs have been taking advantage
of technological developments to provide improvements
in bed articulation, mattress inflation, patient
access, convenience and control. The following
paragraphs illustrate some of the designs that are
currently known.Healthy people typically spend approximately one
third of their time sleeping. People of what may be
considered less than optimum health spend even greater
amounts of time reclining. Beds of various forms have
been developed in order to provide comfort to the user. 
This is particularly true of patients in hospitals and
health care facilities, as well as those in homes who,
for various reasons, are bed ridden.Once one is in bed for extended periods of time in
a situation or condition that does not allow movement
in order to maintain comfort, complications, such as
bed or pressure sores may develop. One way that this
condition has been alleviated is to build beds having
support surfaces that can be moved into various
orientations and configurations. Representative
examples of such beds are disclosed in U.S. Pat. Nos.
3,081,463 issued to Williams et al.; 4,038,709 issued
to Kerwit; 4,099,276 issued to Hunt et al.; 4,371,996
issued to Nahum; 4,745,647 issued to Goodwin; 4,935,968
issued to Hunt et al.; and 5,023,967 issued to Ferrand;
and French Pat. No. 87 16722 issued to Pupovic.Each of these patents disclose beds having
platforms formed of a set of panels that pivot for
assuming configurations corresponding to various
positions of a person's legs and torso. Each of these
provide a back panel that supports a person's torso and
a seat portion that supports the person's hips or hips
and thighs.These panels are typically hinged together or
caused to pivot about a fixed joint corresponding to
the hip joint. It has been observed that the surface
length of the buttocks increases when a person moves 
from a flat reclining position to a sitting position.
Fixed joints do not allow for this variation in body
surface length, thereby requiring the reclining person
to adjust her or his body to accommodate it. If the
person is immobile, such accommodation is not possible.
There therefore remains a need for a bed interpanel
joint that is not fixed, but

<CLAIMS>
A bed for supporting a person comprising a
support platform (822) coupled to a bed frame and having

first and second panels (824, 826) with upwardly facing
support surfaces, one longitudinal edge (824a) of the

first panel positioned substantially parallel to and
adjacent to a longitudinal edge (826a) of the second

panel, and an articulating seat joint assembly (828)
coupling the first panel to the second panel, said

assembly varying the distance between the edges of the
panels as the angle between the panels is varied,


characterised in that
 said joint assembly includes a
drive assembly (834) pivotally connected between the

first and second panels, the drive assembly rotating the
first panel about its longitudinal edge (824a) relative

to the second panel, and a separation-varying hinge
assembly (836) for altering the distance between the

adjacent panel edges while moving the longitudinal edge
of the first panel along a predefined arc (835).
The bed of claim 1 wherein the drive assembly
includes a first support (838) attached to the first

panel, a second support (840) attached to the second
panel, said first support and second support each having

a distal portion spaced from said respective panel, and
an extension rod and drive cylinder (846, 848)

connecting the distal portions of said first and second

support whereby the distance between the distal portions 
of said first and second support is varied as the rod

and cylinder are operated.
The bed of claim 1 or claim 2 wherein the
separation-varying hinge assembly includes a base member

(850), a first link arm (852) pivotally connecting the
base member to the first panel, and a second link arm

(854) pivotally connecting the base member to the second
panel, and a coupling member connecting the first and

second link arms such that the distance between the
panels is varied and the longitudinal edge of the first

panel moves along the arc (835) upon movement of the
base member relative to said panels.
The bed of claim 3 when dependant from claim 2
wherein the base member is slidably mounted to the

extension rod.
The bed of claim 3 or claim 4 wherein said
coupling member includes a coupling link (884)

interconnecting said first and second link arms.
The bed of claim 3 or claim 4 wherein said
coupling member comprises a first pinion (852a) fixedly

attached to said first link arm and a second pinion
(854a) fixedly attached to said second link arm, said

first and second pinions having meshing teeth.
The bed of claim 1 wherein the longitudinal
edge of the first panel and the longitudinal edge of the

second panel are continuously positioned along the
predefined arc.
The bed of claim 1 wherein the predefined arc 
is defined by the dimensions of the first link arm and

the second link arm.
