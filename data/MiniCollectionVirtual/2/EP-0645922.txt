<ABSTRACT>
Time division multiplex telecommunication exchange. In a test mode, a check bit combination, in which one bit has one binary value and the remaining bits have the other binary value, is fed continuously to the inputs of the space stage unit (MUXS0 to MUXS15). One bit is switched through to each output (SLT0 to SLT15) in succession. The operations are then repeated with an inverted check bit combination. The procedure is repeated until a single bit of one and the other binary value is switched through from each input to each output. Monitoring for the occurrence of the expected check bit combinations is carried out on the output side.

<CLAIMS>
Method for checking the switching elements in a
space-switch unit in a switching matrix in a digital

time-division multiplex telecommunication exchange,
characterized

in that
 a test mode active as an alternative to a
switching mode involves the inputs of the space-switch

unit each being continuously supplied with, instead of
telecommunication information, a bit of a first test

bit combination in which all the bits except for one
have the same binary value, in that, in a first step,

this bit combination is respectively connected a
plurality of times such that, during correct operation,

each connection involves one bit which has the other
binary value being passed to another of the outputs of

the space-switch unit, in that such connections are
repeated in a second step using a second test bit

combination in which the binary values of the inverse
of the first test bit combination, with the respective

bit combinations which appear at the outputs of the
space stages being supplied to a check for the presence

of an expected bit pattern instead of being forwarded
to continuing time-division multiplex lines, as occurs

in switching mode, and in that the first and second
steps are repeated using appropriately changed test bit

combinations until every input in the space stage has
connected a test bit whose binary value differs from 

that of the rest of the test bits in the test bit
combination.
