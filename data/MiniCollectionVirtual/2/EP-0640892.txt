<CLAIMS>
Timepiece including at least one indicating organ 
(3), in particular for dates, and a correction mechanism 

for said indicating organ, said correction mechanism 
comprising at least, on the one hand, a control stem (7) 

movable between at least two axial positions, and, on the 
other hand,, a sliding pinion (9) and a correction pinion 

(17) mounted on said stem, said correction pinion being 
free to rotate and one of its faces being formed so as to 

be able to cooperate with one of the faces of the sliding 
pinion (9) and to permit driving of said correction pinion 

by the sliding pinion when said control stem (7) is in a 
first one of said axial positions, said face of the 

sliding pinion exhibiting at least one spur (28a, 28b) 
arranged at a distance from the rotation axis of said 

sliding pinion, said spur (28a, 28b) being intended to 
come into engagement in an opening (25a, 25b) formed in 

said face of said correction pinion, so as to cooperate 
with a side of said opening in a manner to drive said 

correction pinion in rotation. 
Timepiece according to claim 1, characterized in 
that said correction pinion (17) appears in the form of a 

toothed disc pierced in its center by a generally circular 
hole (24) in which said control stem (7) is engaged and in 

that the periphery of said generally circular hole (24) 
includes at least one notch (25a, 25b) provided to receive 

said spur (28a, 28b) of the sliding pinion. 
Timepiece according to claim 2, characterized in 
that the periphery of said generally circular hole (24) 

includes two notches (25a, 25b) arranged diametrally 
opposite one another, and in that the sliding pinion 

includes two spurs (28a, 28b) symmetrically arranged on 
either side of said control stem (7) and provided so as to 

engage respectively in said two notches.
