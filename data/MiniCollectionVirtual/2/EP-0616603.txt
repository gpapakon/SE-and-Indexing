<ABSTRACT>
Heavy metals are separated from aqueous media containing the same by contacting the said medium with finely divided iron oxide (Fe3O4) and finely divided ferrous sulphide, maintaining said contact until at least a substantial proportion of said heavy metal has become bound to said iron oxide and ferrous sulphide, and then separating the iron oxide and ferrous sulphide having heavy metal bound thereto from the aqueous medium.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to the separation of heavy 
metals, especially toxic metals, from aqueous media 
containing the same, e.g. industrial effluents. There is a need for simple and effective methods for 
removing heavy metals, especially toxic heavy metals such 
as cadmium, from industrial effluents and other aqueous 
media which contain them. Treatment to remove heavy metals 
is necessary before effluent can be sent to waste and there 
are increasingly stringent requirements for acceptably low 
levels of such metals. In our European specification 0186445A we described a 
process for the separation of metals from aqueous media in 
which an aqueous medium containing a paramagnetic metal is 
contacted with cellular particles, e.g. bacteria, in the 
presence of a compound converted by the particles into a 
product which interacts with the metal and causes the metal 
to become bound to the particles which are then separated 
magnetically. In one embodiment of this process 
Desulphovibrio bacteria which reduce sulphate to sulphide 
are used. When the aqueous medium containing the 
paramagnetic metal is contacted with Desulphovibrio in the 
presence of dissolved sulphate, a water-insoluble sulphide 
of the metal is formed on the cell wall of the 
Desulphovibrio and is thereby removed from the aqueous 
medium.  
 The present invention provides an improved method for 
removing heavy metals, which need not be paramagnetic, from 
aqueous media containing them. The new method is simple to 
use, can be operated without the use of microorganisms and 
rapidly removes a very large proportion of the heavy metals 
present in the aqueous medium. The process of the present invention for the 
separation of a heavy metal from an aqueous medium 
containing the same comprises contacting the said medium 
with ferrous sulphide physically attached to finely divided synthetic iron oxide (Fe3O4) having a particle size less than 1 µm 
maintaining said 
contact until at least 90% of said 
heavy metal has become bound to the said 
ferrous sulphide, and then separating magnetically the iron oxide and 
ferrous sulphide having the heavy metal bound thereto from 
the aqueous medium. The iron 
oxide used in the present invention is Fe3O4, sometimes 
called magnetite, a term which however includes both 
mineral and synthetic Fe3O4. Only synthetic Fe3O4 is used 
in the present invention. The iron oxide used in the present invention must be 
very finely divided and must in particular have a particle 
size less than about 1 µm. Iron oxide
