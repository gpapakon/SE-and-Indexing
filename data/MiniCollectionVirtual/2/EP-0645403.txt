A process for the preparation of pulverulent 
polyethylenes having a viscometrically measured 

molecular weight of at least 10
6
 g/mol and a bulk 
density of 350 to 460 g/l, in particular 430 to 460 

g/l, by polymerization of ethylene at temperatures of 
30 to 130°C and pressures of 0.05 to 4 MPa in the 

presence of a mixed catalyst, comprising a titanium 
component and an organic aluminum compound, and a 

molecular weight regulator, which comprises that in a 
first stage the titanium component of the mixed 

catalysts is prepared by reaction in two steps, 
wherein in a first step a Ti(IV) compound being 

reacted with an organic aluminum compound at -40 to 
140°C in a molar ratio of titanium to aluminum of 1 : 

0.1 to 1 : 0.6 to give a titanium(III) compound and 
in the second step, the reaction product of the first 

step being aftertreated with an organic aluminum 
compound at -10 to 150°C in a molar ratio of titanium 

to aluminum of 1 : 0.01 to 1 : 5 and the titanium 
component being formed into the mixed catalyst with 

an organic aluminum compound in a molar ratio of 
titanium to aluminum of 1 : 1 to 1 : 15 and that in a 

second stage ethylene is polymerized at temperatures 
of 30 - 130°C and pressures of 0.05 to 4 MPa in the 

presence of the mixed catalyst prepared in the first 
stage and the molecular weight regulator.
