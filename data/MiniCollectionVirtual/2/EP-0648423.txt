<ABSTRACT>
The intention is to design a holder for gathered natural sausage skins in such a way that it is supplied rolled up on a drum and can be cut to the required length before the application of gathered natural skins. This is achieved in that the holder is composed of a flexible strip which is longitudinally folded in the middle and rests, with both its parts taking the form of planar legs, astride the sausage meat filling pipe in a rooflike fashion.
