<ABSTRACT>
An ignition timing control system for an 
internal combustion engine is associated with a fuel 

injection amount control system for calculating an 
amount of fuel to be supplied to the engine, based on 

operating conditions of the engine, correcting the 
calculated amount of fuel, based on an adherent amount 

of fuel adhering to the inner wall surface of the 
intake passage, and a carried-off amount of fuel to be 

carried off from the adherent fuel into each combustion 
chamber of the engine, and injecting the corrected fuel 

amount into the intake passage. The ignition timing 
control system comprises an ECU which detects whether 

the engine has been recovered from a fuel cut state to 
a fuel supply state, and calculates ignition timing of 

the engine, based on operating conditions of the engine 
detected by engine operating parameter sensors, 

including pressure within the intake passage. A retard 
amount by which the ignition timing is to be retarded 

is calculated based on the detected operating 
conditions of the engine when it is detected that the 

engine has been recovered from the fuel cut state to 
the fuel supply state. Further, the ignition timing is 

corrected based on the calculated retard amount.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to an ignition timing
control system for internal combustion engines, and
more particularly to an ignition timing control system
for an internal combustion engine equipped with a fuel
injection amount control system which calculates a fuel
injection amount so as to compensate for an amount of
fuel (liquid fuel) adhering to the inner wall surface
of the intake pipe of the engine after being injected
into the intake pipe.In an internal combustion engine wherein liquid
fuel such as gasoline is injected into the intake pipe
of the engine, part of the injected fuel adheres to the
inner wall surface of the intake pipe so that
unfavorably a required amount of fuel is not supplied
to the combustion chamber of the engine. A fuel supply
amount control method for internal combustion engines,
which eliminates the above inconvenience, has been
known, for example, from Japanese Patent Publication
(Kokoku) No. 3-59255, which estimates an amount of fuel
(adherent fuel amount) adhering to the inner wall
surface of the intake pipe and a fuel amount carried
off (drawn) from the inner surface of the intake pipe
into the combustion chamber of the engine due to
evaporation of adherent fuel or a drawing force of
intake air, to thereby control the fuel injection
amount for the engine in a manner compensating for the 
adherent fuel amount and the carried-off fuel amount.The above-mentioned proposed method has
eliminated a drawback of a conventional fuel injection
amount control method which is based on the premise
that injected fuel is drawn in a sufficient amount into
the combustion chamber of the engine, more
specifically, a drawback that an insufficient amount of
fuel is supplied to the engine due to a larger amount
of fuel adhering to the inner surface of the intake
pipe immediately after fuel cut, i.e. interruption of
fuel supply to the engine has been completed.However, according to the proposed fuel supply
amount control method, which controls the fuel
injection amount to be supplied to the engine in a
manner compensating for the adherent fuel amount and
the carried-off fuel amount, when the engine is
recovered from a fuel-cut state into a fuel supply
state (hereinafter referred to as "the recovery from
F/C"), the following inconvenience arises:That is, according to an ordinary fuel supply
amount control method which does not take into account
the adherent fuel amount and the carried-off fuel
amount, at the recovery from F/C, part of the injected
fuel adheres to the inner wall surface of the
