<ABSTRACT>
A permanently installed metal retainer for an air bag gas 
generator igniter tube end closure is tapered press fit for 

ease of installation, sealing, and enhanced retention, and 
includes a final crimp into a suitably positioned groove 

(78) on the end of the igniter tube (28) for positive 
retention.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to an improvement in the 
mechanism for igniting a gas generator or inflator of the 
type that utilizes the combustion of a solid fuel gas 
generant composition for the generation of a gas to inflate 
an inflatable crash protection air bag or cushion. The 
invention is particularly advantageous for use in a gas 
generator provided on the passenger side of an automotive 
vehicle. Typically, a solid fuel gas generator for the 
passenger side of an automotive vehicle is elongated. In 
one embodiment, the gas generator has a length of 30.02 cm (11.82 
inches) and an overall diameter of 6.77 cm (2.43 inches). 
An elongated tubular outer housing for the 
generator advantageously may be made of aluminum. For most 
of the length thereof, the outer housing has a relatively 
thin cylindrical wall in which a plurality of gas exit 
holes or ports are provided. One end of the outer housing, termed the stud end, 
is closed by material formed integrally therewith and 
includes a threaded stud projecting therefrom. The other 
end of the outer housing, termed the base end, is closed by 
a flange. The flange member is attached in a sealing 
manner to the base end of the outer housing by a suitable 
process such as inertia welding. A welding process that 
may be employed is described in US-A- 4,547,942 
to Adams et al. 
The flange member 
serves as a squib and initiator holder. Extending for a substantial portion of the length 
of the outer housing and centrally thereof so as to be  
 
generally concentric therewith, is an elongated generally 
cylindrical tubular member comprising an igniter tube. The 
igniter tube contains ignition granules of an appropriate 
pyrotechnic material capable of providing rapid 
deflagration. A squib and initiator are provided in 
operative relation with and close to the end of the igniter 
tube that is adjacent to the base end of the housing. At 
the stud end of the housing the igniter tube is closed by a 
rubber boot. The rubber boot incorporates an ignition 
granule retention disk. A tube locator cap comprising a silicone pad is 
positioned adjacent to the inner side of the integrally 
formed end at the stud end of the housing and a retaining 
cup is positioned adjacent the inner side of the base end 
of the housing for facilitating positioning of the igniter 
tube and for retaining it in place. A retainer disk is 
provided to keep the retaining cup and the gas generant 
material in place within the housing during the assembly 
operation, suitably spaced from the

<CLAIMS>
An igniter tube boot for closing an air bag gas 
generator ignition system igniter tube, comprising a tube 

(70,70') having a leading end (76) and a trailing end (74), 
and further including a retainer disk (72) having a 

diameter that is substantially the same as that of the 
trailing end (74) of the igniter tube boot, characterised 

in that the tube (70, 70') has a tapered cylindrical shape, 
said leading end having a larger diameter than said 

trailing end, and said trailing end being radially inwardly 
curved and slightly inverted. 
An igniter tube boot as claimed in claim 1 wherein 
said tube (70,70') is made of a non-pyrotechnic, non-flammable 

material. 
An igniter tube boot as claimed in claim 1 or claim 
2 wherein said leading end (76) of the tapered cylindrical 

tube (70') is flared slightly. 
An igniter tube boot as claimed in any preceding 
claim, wherein said tapered cylindrical tube (70,70') is 

made of a metal. 
An igniter tube boot as claimed in claim 4, wherein 
said tapered cylindrical tube (70,70') is made of aluminum. 
An igniter tube boot as claimed in any preceding 
claim, wherein said leading end (76) of the tapered 

cylindrical tube is bendable to allow crimping thereof into 
a suitably positioned notch or groove (78) on the end of 

the igniter tube (28) on which said tube boot is to be 
installed. 
An igniter tube boot as defined in claim 6, wherein 
said retainer disk has an interference fit into 

substantially the full depth of said tapered  
 

cylindrical tube when installed therein from said leading 
end (76) thereof, and seating against the end of the 

igniter tube when so installed, being forced thereagainst 
by the slightly inverted trailing end (74) of said 

cylindrical tube. 
An igniter tube boot as claimed in claim 7, 
wherein said retainer disk (72) comprises a wire cloth 

mesh. 
An air bag gas generator ignition system comprising 
an igniter tube (28) containing ignition granules (59), 

said igniter tube being closed at one end by a boot as 
claimed in any preceding claim. 
An air bag gas generator ignition system as claimed 
in claim 9, wherein said leading end (76) of the tapered 

cylindrical tube is of slightly larger diameter than the 
ignition tube (28) and is crimped into a notch or groove 

(78) at the end of the igniter tube.
