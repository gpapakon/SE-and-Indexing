semiconductor power device against overvoltages comprises at 

least one first diode (D1) and at least one second diode (D2) 
defined in a lightly doped layer (1) of a first conductivity 

type in which the power device is also obtained; the first 
diode (D1) has a first electrode connected to a control 

electrode (G) of the power device and a second electrode 
connected to a second electrode of the second diode (D2); the 

second diode (D2) has a first electrode connected to a load 
driving electrode (D) of the power device; the second diode 

(D2) has the second electrode represented by a first buried 
region (11) of a second conductivity type which is buried in 

the lightly doped layer (1) and the first electrode represented 
by a first dope
d region (12) of the first conductivity type 
which extends from a semiconductor top surface into the lightly

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an integrated structure
active clamp for the protection of power semiconductor devices,
such as power MOSFETs, IGBTs or power BJTs, against
overvoltages.Dynamic clamp circuits are generally used in conjunction
with power semiconductor devices which drive inductive loads to
protect the power devices against overvoltages which are
generated when the load current is switched off.Dynamic clamp circuits are divided into two broad
categories: active and passive clamp circuits.A typical active clamp circuit comprises two zener diodes
connected by their anodes, and a resistor; a first or reverse
zener diode has the cathode connected to the terminal of the
power device to which the inductive load is also connected, for
example the drain terminal of a power MOSFET or the collector
terminal of an Insulated Gate Bipolar Transistor (IGBT) or of a
power Bipolar Junction Transistor (power BJT); a second or
forward zener diode has the cathode connected to the driving
electrode of the power device, i.e. the gate electrode of a
power MOSFET or of an IGBT or the base electrode of a power
BJT; the resistor is connected between the driving electrode of
the power device and a driving terminal to which a driving
signal is applied.Referring for example to a power MOSFET, when the driving
terminal is driven low, the power MOSFET is turned off; due to
the inductive nature of the load, an overvoltage appears on the 
drain terminal; provided that the zener voltage Vz of the first
zener diode is lower than the breakdown voltage of the power
MOSFET, when the voltage on the drain terminal exceeds Vz (more
precisely, when the drain voltage exceeds Vz plus the forward
voltage necessary to turn the second zener diode on), the first
zener diode breaks down, and an electrical current can flow
through the two zener diodes and the resistor to the driving
terminal; said current gives rise to a voltage drop across the
resistor, thus raising the voltage on the gate terminal of the
power MOSFET; this causes the power MOSFET to turn on again, so
that the overvoltage is limited. The second zener diode is used
to prevent current from flowing from the driving terminal to
the drain terminal when the driving terminal is driven high
(i.e. when the power device is switched on), so that a full 5 V
signal can be applied to the gate electrode of the power
MOSFET.A clamp circuit such that described works better if it is
integrated in the same chip of the power semiconductor device:
in this case parasitic inductances are
