<ABSTRACT>
A double-effect distribution sequential valve shaft 
assembly for use within a cylinder head cover of internal 

combustion engines or other valve-type distribution systems, 
includes a rotating valve shaft with openings from side to 

side in the vertical plane and a jacket supporting the valve 
shaft for rotation therein. An opening in the valve shaft 

communicates through diametrically opposed openings in the 
jacket with the combustion chamber twice during every turn 

of the valve shaft to regulate the flow of gases into and 
out of the combustion chamber. The jacket is provided with 

a series of labyrinths etched into an inner surface thereof 
to create a barrier to gases flowing out of the combustion 

chamber during the compression and explosion strokes. The 
jacket is also provided with a plurality of circumferential 

grooves formed in the inner surface thereof to form a high 
pressure fluid seal when lubricating oil is introduced 

therein under pressure. The sequential valve shaft thus has 
a very high closing efficiency and heat transfer properties 

in all phases of operation.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a device to be used in
any machine which uses a valve distribution system and
especially for use in internal combustion engines. More
particularly, the present invention relates to a double
effect distribution sequential valve shaft assembly with a
high closing efficiency for use in an internal combustion
engine (See EP-A- 59047).The present invention will be described by illustrating
its operation in an internal combustion engine with spark
ignition. Thus, as background, one of the most common valve
distribution systems for a four stroke gasoline engine will
be described briefly. The valve in such a system is a rod
with a small plate on one extreme which has a conical seat
for shutting the opening to the cylinder head, due to the
effect of a spring fixed to it. The valve slips inside a guide, and the opening and
closing of the cylinder is done by a rocker arm which pushes
it to its extreme or, when the pressure of the rocker arm
ceases, it closes the conduit by the effect of the spring.
The movement of the rocker arm is carried out by a camshaft
which transmits the sequence of opening and closing of each
one of the intake or exhaust valves. The camshaft is moved
by the crankshaft by means of a chain, cogwheels or a dented
belt with a rotational speed equal to 1/2 that of the
crankshaft in a four stroke engine (Otto cycle).While the above-described conventional system is
currently used in a large majority of four-stroke gasoline
engines manufactured today, an alternative valve arrangement
has also been provided. For example, in European Patent No.
0 059 047 issued to Baldwin, a rotary valve arrangement is
disclosed having two longitudinal valve shafts rotatably
mounted within the cylinder head cover and aligned with the
engine axis. The valve shafts are cylindrical in shape and
each include a radial passageway for controlling the flow of
fluid into and out of the combustion chamber as the valves
rotate. One of the valve shafts communicates with an inlet
port leading into the combustion chamber, and the other
communicates with an exhaust port.In operation of the device of Baldwin, since the radial
passageways extend through the valve shafts from side to
side, the valves open twice for each complete rotation of 
the valve shaft. For this reason, the valve shaft is
typically called a "double effect sequential valve shaft."
Because of this double effect, one complete turn of the
crankshaft need only correspond to 1/4 of the turn of the
double effect distribution sequential
