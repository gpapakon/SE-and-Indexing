<ABSTRACT>
According to the invention, in order to assemble at least one first electronic component (1) equipped with at least one first electrical contact region (5) and at least one second electronic component (10) equipped with at least one second electrical contact region (13), a loop of conducting mircowire is produced (7), having at least one end on the first region, a solder element is produced on the second region, the components are positioned in such a way that the loop is opposite the solder element, the assembly is heated to melt the solder element (15b) and to fix the loop onto it, and the assembly is cooled.
