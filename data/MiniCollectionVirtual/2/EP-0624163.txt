<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to novel compounds, processes for preparing them,
pharmaceutical compositions containing them and their use in therapy. More particularly
this invention concerns novel calcitonin derivatives.The calcitonins are a class of pharmacologically active peptides, of both natural and
synthetic origin, which contain approximately thirty two amino acids, and which have the
ability to regulate serum calcium levels. Examples of naturally occuring calcitonins include
rat, salmon, eel, chicken, ox, pig, sheep and human calcitonins. Examples of synthetically
modified calcitonins include 1,7-dicarba-calcitonins such as eel 1,7-dicarba-calcitonin
(elcatonin), salmon 1,7-dicarba-calcitonin and human 1,7-dicarba-calcitonin. Various
calcitonins, including e.g. natural human, salmon and eel calcitonins and the synthetic eel
calcitonin analogue elcatonin are now commercially available and commonly employed, e.g.
in the treatment of Paget's disease, Sudeck's disease and osteoporosis. J. Org. Chem.
(1989), 54 (17), 4224-4228 describes the synthesis of certain atrial natriuretic factor
analogues having inter alia a dehydro-L-α-aminosuberic acid bridge.We have now found a group of novel, synthetically modified calcitonins, having interesting
hypocalcaemic activity.In a first aspect therefore the present invention
provides compounds of formula (I):

wherein:
(X-Y)represents CH=CH or C≡C;Arepresents represents fragments 2-6 of a naturally
occurring calcitonin, or a modified variant thereof which is a peptide residue:
 
wherein A2 represents Ser, Gly or Ala and A3 represents Asn or Ser;Brepresents fragments 8-32 of a naturally
occurring calcitonin, or a modified variant thereof, which modified variant has the
formula:

in which
C represents -Leu-Gln-Thr-Tyr; Gln-Thr-Tyr; or a bond;D represents -Asn-Thr; -Asp-Val; -Ala-Thr or -Ala-Val; andE represents Ser or Ala;m and neach independently represent 0, 1 or 2; andR1, R2, R3, and R4independently represent hydrogen or a substituent group e.g. a C1-4 alkyl group.In the compounds of Formula (I) modified variants of fragments A and B, refer to such
modified fragments as are known in the art, and include fragments wherein one or more
amino acids in the naturally occurring sequence have been replaced or deleted.Preferably fragment (A) represents fragments 2-6 corresponding to those found in naturally
occurring pig, ox, sheep, human, rat, eel, salmon or chicken calcitonins for example:

or
Most preferably (A) represents:
 
Fragment (B) preferably represents
