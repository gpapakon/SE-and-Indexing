<DESCRIPTION>
THE PRESENT INVENTION relates to a bin for collecting 
cigarette stubs, hereinafter called a cigarette disposal 
bin. The invention also relates to a cigarette disposal 
bin formed with an area adapted for stubbing out cigarettes 
for disposal in the bin. Conventional cigarette disposal bins, which may be, 
for example, mounted on walls or upon stands, have a front 
facia which is hinged towards the top of the bin such that 
the interior of the bin can be accessed by hinging the 
front facia open. The conventional bins have a sloping 
bottom such that the cigarettes which have been placed 
inside the disposal bin automatically slide out from the 
bin when the front facia is opened. The person emptying 
the bin has no control over the emptying of the bin and, 
when it is windy or when the bin is extremely full, the ash 
and cigarettes within the disposal bin may not fall neatly 
within a collection bin but may fall or be blown on to the 
floor thus creating a mess on the floor area around the 
cigarette disposal bin. Conventional cigarette disposal bins have a planar 
front facia formed with a series of apertures. Many 
smokers stub out their cigarettes on the cigarette disposal 
bins before placing their cigarette in the disposal bin, 
thus creating a certain amount of ash and debris around the 
cigarette disposal bin. It is an object of the present invention to provide 
a means for reducing the amount of ash and debris around a 
cigarette disposal bin.  Accordingly, one aspect of the present invention 
provides a cigarette disposal bin comprising an outer shell 
formed with at least one aperture through which a cigarette 
may be inserted into the bin, a separate collection device 
located within the outer shell for collecting cigarettes 
inserted into the bin, a baffle provided within the bin 
below the at least one aperture for preventing smoke from 
a cigarette from escaping through the at least one aperture 
and for extinguishing a cigarette in the collection device, 
which baffle defines an opening into the collection device, 
the collection device retaining cigarettes in the cigarette 
disposal bin when the cigarette disposal bin is opened. A further aspect of the present invention provides 
a cigarette disposal bin comprising an outer shell formed 
with at least one aperture through which a cigarette may be 
inserted into the bin, a stubbing out portion located 
adjacent the at least one aperture such that ash falling 
from a cigarette when stubbed out on the stubbing out 
portion falls through

<CLAIMS>
A cigarette disposal bin comprising an outer shell 
(2,3,7,8) formed with at least one aperture (10) through 

which a cigarette may be inserted into the bin, a separate 
collection device (12) located within the outer shell 

(2,3,7,8) for collecting cigarettes inserted into the bin, 
a baffle (13) provided within the bin below the at least 

one aperture (10) for preventing smoke from a cigarette 
from escaping through the at least one aperture (10) and 

for extinguishing a cigarette in the collection device 
(12), which baffle (13) defines an opening (G;19) into the 

collection device (12), the collection device (12) 
retaining cigarettes in the cigarette disposal bin when the 

cigarette disposal bin is opened. 
A cigarette disposal bin according to Claim 1, 
wherein the collection device (12) comprises a box 

dimensioned to be received within the cigarette disposal 
bin, the cigarette disposal bin being opened by hinging 

open a front facia (3) to allow access to the collection 
device (12). 
A cigarette disposal bin according to Claim 1, 
wherein the collection device (12) comprises a box 

dimensioned to be received within the cigarette disposal 
bin, the bottom surface (5) of the collection device 

comprising the bottom surface (5) of the cigarette disposal 
bin and the collection device (12) being accessed by 

unlocking locking means (11) to allow the collection device 
(12) to drop from the cigarette disposal bin. 
A cigarette disposal bin according to any preceding 
Claim, wherein the collection device (12) has a first 

opening (19) defined by the baffle (13) for receiving 
cigarettes and a second opening (21) under the baffle (13) 

through which cigarettes may be ejected when the collection 
device (12) is turned upside down. 
A cigarette disposal bin according to any preceding 
Claim, wherein the baffle (13) comprises a hingeable baffle 

(13,15) mounted on the collection device (12) such that the 
baffle (13) prevents smoke escaping from the collection 

device (12) and extinguishes a cigarette in the collection 
device (12) and such that, when the collection device (12) 

is removed from the cigarette disposal bin, the collection 
device (12) can be tilted upside down allowing the hinged 

baffle (13,15) to open thereby allowing discarded 
cigarettes to be emptied from the collection device (12). 
A cigarette disposal bin according to any preceding 
Claim, wherein a stubbing out portion (23) is provided on 

the bin located adjacent the at least one aperture (10) 
such that ash falling from a cigarette when stubbed out on 

the stubbing out portion (23) falls through the at least 
one aperture (10) into the cigarette disposal bin. 
A cigarette disposal bin according to any one of 
Claims 1 to 5, wherein a stubbing out portion (23) is 

provided on the bin and comprises an aperture (10) covered 
with a wire mesh such that a cigarette being stubbed out on 

the mesh would be at least partially extinguished and ash 
falling from the stubbed out cigarette would fall through 

the aperture (10). 
A cigarette disposal bin according to any preceding 
claim, wherein a plurality of baffles (13) are provided 

 
below the aperture (10) to reduce further the amount of 

smoke escaping from the aperture (10). 
A cigarette disposal bin comprising an outer shell 
(2,3,7,8) formed with at least one aperture (10) through 

which a cigarette may be inserted into the bin, a stubbing 
out portion (23) located adjacent the at least one aperture 

(10) such that ash falling from a cigarette when stubbed 
out on the stubbing out portion (23) falls through the at 

least one aperture (10) into the cigarette disposal bin.
