<ABSTRACT>
Manipulator for articles, especially reels (51) of wound packaging material, in association with packaging machines, having at least one long-stroke telescopic member (10) which serves for the automatic movement of a supporting journal (50) for the reel (51). The telescopic member (10) is extendable by means of compressed air and retractable by means of a pull member (20). The pull member (20) is arranged outside the telescopic member (10), is firmly anchored at one end and can be wound up and unwound at the other end. The pull member (20) runs over a deflecting wheel (23) arranged at the free end of the telescopic member (10), namely on a piston rod (15) of the latter.

Handling apparatus for objects, in particular 
bobbins of wound material webs, having at least one 

telescopic member (10) comprising a basic cylinder (11), 

a plurality of retractable and extendable, pressure-medium-actuated 
telescopic cylinders (12, 13, 14) and a 

likewise retractable and extendable, pressure-medium-actuated 
piston rod (15), which is guided in the inner, 

or lower, telescopic cylinder (14), it being possible for 
the telescopic member (10) to be retracted by means of an 

open-ended tension member (20), and it being possible for 
a tensile force to be transmitted to at least one end of 

the tension member (20) in order to retract the 
telescopic member (10), characterized by the following 

features: 

a) the tension member (20) runs over a deflection 
roller (23) which is fitted centrally on the piston 

rod (15), the axis of rotation of the deflection 
roller (23) being located on the longitudinal 

central axis of the telescopic member (10), 
b) the tension member (20) is anchored fixedly by one 
end and, for this purpose, is connected directly to 

the telescopic member (10), namely is fastened on 
the outside of the outer, or upper, basic cylinder 

(11), 
c) the tension member (20) can be wound up onto a 
winding drum (26), and unwound therefrom, by the 

other end, the winding drum (26) likewise being 
fitted on the telescopic member (10), namely on that 

side which is located diametrically opposite the 
fixedly anchored end of the tension member (20), on  

 
the outside of the basic cylinder (11). 
Handling apparatus according to Claim 1, characterized 
in that the tension member (20) is a toothed 

belt, and in that the tension member (20) forms approximately 
parallel strands (28, 29) on both sides of the 

telescopic member (10) by supporting the strands (28, 29) 
on supporting rollers (30, 31) on both sides of the telescopic 

member (10). 
Handling apparatus according to Claim 1, characterized 
in that the extension length of the telescopic 

member (10), or the relative position thereof, can be 
measured with reference to the retraction and extension 

length of the tension member (20), in particular by an 
angular increment transducer which determines the 

retracted or extended length of the tension member (20) 
with reference to the revolutions of a deflection wheel 

(25) for the tension member (20), and in that the telescopic 
member can be controlled in dependence on the 

measurement result. 
Handling apparatus according to Claim 1, characterized 
in that one end of the tension member (20) is 

elastically anchored, in particular in an anchorage piece 
(21) which can be displaced counter to spring force, 

measuring members for sensing the relative position of 
the anchorage piece (21) in accordance with the tensile 

stressing in the tension member (20) being assigned 
preferably to the end of the tension member (20) or to 

the anchorage piece (21). 
Handling apparatus according to Claim 1, characterized 
in that the deflection wheel (23) is mounted, by 

means of a transversely directed rotary pin, in the 
region of an end piece (16) of the piston rod (15), 

between webs, centrically with respect to the longitudinal 
central axis of the telescopic member (10). 
Handling apparatus according to Claim 1, characterized 
in that the telescopic parts, in particular the 

telescopic cylinders (11, 12, 13), are guided non-rotatably 
one inside the other by virtue of mutually corresponding 

shaping, and in that the corresponding shaping is  
 

provided by flattenings (43) on inner surfaces (42) 
and/or outer surfaces of cylinder tubes (35, 35a) of 

adjacent telescopic cylinders (12, 13, 14). 
Handling apparatus according to Claim 6, characterized 
in that the outer cylinder tube (35) is supported, 

in the lower or free end region in each case, on 
the inner cylinder tube (35a) by a bearing bush (44), 

arranged between the two adjacent cylinder tubes (35, 
35a), and in that the contour of the bearing bush (44) 

corresponds to the contour of the respectively abutting 
cylinder tube (35, 35a), such that the bearing bush (44) 

is provided with an outer surface and/or inner surface 
which exhibits the flattening (43). 
Handling apparatus according to Claim 6 or 7, 
characterized in that the inner surface (42) of the
