<ABSTRACT>
A remote meter reading system for example for domestic water meters, operates through an inductive coupling over two lines. A sinusoidal power signal is transmitted from a reader to the meter to power up encoding circuitry in the meter. The encoding circuitry then transmits data by intermittently shorting the input terminals to cause an asynchronous voltage modulation at the reader.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to the remote reading of meters and
in an important example to the remote reading by public utilities of
water or other meters.There already exist systems for the remote reading of water
meters. Typically, each water meter is provided with an encoder
capable of deriving a digital encoding of the meter reading. In the
case of a water meter having conventional number wheels, the encoder
may operate to sense electrically the position of the number wheels.
Since each water meter is read relatively infrequently, the encoder
means is not normally powered but derives the power necessary for
encoding from the remote reader. The encoder may be situated entirely
at the meter site or may include an interface connected with the meter
but positioned for more straightforward access.In one known arrangement, the encoder interface and the
portable reader are connected by a plug and socket arrangement. In
this way it is a simple matter to establish the necessary connections
for the supply to the encoder of power and the necessary clock signal,
and for transmission of data from the encoder to the reader. Plug and
socket connections are regarded as inconvenient, however, and
alternative prior proposals operate through inductive coupling.
Suitable arrangements of coils in the encoder interface and the
portable reader allow for the supply of power and clock information to
the encoder and the transmission from the encoder of data. One
particular prior proposal (see for example EP 0 131 732) enables the
use of a single pair of coils. This has the advantage of significantly
reducing the component cost at the encoder interface. In this prior
proposal, there is developed a combined power and clock signal which
comprises a relatively high frequency periodic signal within a square
wave envelope. Thus the power signal comprises a regular succession of
high frequency bursts. The encoder is arranged through careful timing
to transmit during the gaps between these high frequency bursts. In
fact, the transmission from the encoder takes the form of a like-burst
of high frequency signal with the presence of such a burst between
adjacent bursts of the power signal representing a binary "0" and the
absence "1". An alternative arrangement, disclosed in EP 0 463 893, is intended to
operate under both plug and socket and inductive couplings. In the
inductive coupling, or so-called "two wire" mode, data is transmitted by
varying the current drawn by the meter interface, in synchronism with the
interrogating clock signal.
