<ABSTRACT>
2.1. In the production of cigarette packs, glue units (14) having glue nozzles (15) are increasingly used, in order to provide with glue pack folding tabs which are to be glued to one another. The glue units (14) or glue nozzles (15) require careful maintenance. For this purpose, the packaging machine is equipped with a maintenance station (16) which allows the necessary manipulations on the glue units (14) in a position favourable for servicing. 2.2. The maintenance station (16) or a holding device (17) is designed so that glue units (14) can be positioned alternatively in a testing position and in a cleaning position.

<CLAIMS>
Packaging machine, especially for the production 
of cigarette packs, with at least one glue assembly (14) 

for coating glue onto pack folding tabs to be adhesively 
bonded to one another, each glue assembly (14) having at 

least one glue nozzle (15), characterized in that the 
packaging machine has a maintenance station (16) for the 

glue assembly, in that the glue assembly (14) is attached 
removably to a working mounting located on the machine, 

and in that the glue assembly (14) can be removed from 
the working mounting for maintenance and repair purposes 

and can be attached to a holding device (17) in the maintenance 
station (16) in a region of the packaging machine 

convenient for tending purposes. 
Packaging machine according to Claim 1, characterized 
in that the holding device (17) in the maintenance 

station (16) is set for the simultaneous reception 
of a plurality of glue assemblies (14), in particular of 

two. 
Packaging machine according to Claim 1 or 2, 
characterized in that the holding device (17) in the 

maintenance station (16) allows different relative positions 
of the glue assemblies (14), namely at least one 

cleaning or repair position, in which the glue nozzles 
(15) are exposed to the tending side, and at least one 

testing position, in which the glue nozzles (15) can be 
fed with glue and actuated. 
Packaging machine according to Claim 3, characterized 
in that the glue assembly (14) in the testing 

position is arranged in the correct position above a  
 

collecting container (20) for the interception of glue. 
Packaging machine according to Claim 4, characterized 
in that glue assemblies (14) in the testing 

position are attached to the holding device (17) in a 
position which is directed obliquely downwards in such a 

way that two glue assemblies (14), which are attached on 
opposite sides of the holding device (17), point with 

their glue nozzles (15) in the direction towards the 
common collecting container (20). 
Packaging machine according to Claim 4, characterized 
in that, in the maintenance station (16), the 

glue assemblies (14), in the cleaning or repair position, 
are arranged in a relative position offset at 90Â° in 

relation to the testing position, especially with glue 
nozzles (15) directed obliquely upwards and exposed to 

the tending side. 
Packaging machine according to Claim 1 or one of 
the other claims, characterized in that the holding 

device (17), like the working mounting located on the 
machine, has holding members for the positive positioning 

of the glue assemblies (14) in a predetermined relative 
position, especially support pieces (21, 29) which 

penetrate positively into a correspondingly designed 
recess or depression (22) of the glue assembly (14), the 

glue assembly (14) preferably being capable of being 
fastened to the support piece (21, 28) by means of an 

anchoring bolt (23) actuable by hand. 
Packaging machine according to Claim 1 or one of 
the other claims, characterized in that supply conduits, 

especially compressed-air conduit (30) and/or glue 
conduit (31), leading to the glue assembly (14) are 

designed and arranged in such a way that the glue 
assembly (14) can be moved out of the working position 

into the maintenance station (16), with the connections 
being maintained. 
Packaging machine according to Claim 1 or one of 
the other claims, characterized in that, in the region of 

the maintenance station (16), separate connections for 
the supply of the glue assembly are formed on the holding  

 
device (17), especially connections for the current 

supply, namely at least one plug socket (32). 
Packaging machine according to Claim 1 or one of 
the other claims, characterized in that in the region of 

the working mounting located on the machine and/or in the 
region of the holding device (17) of the maintenance 

station (16) are mounted monitoring members, epecially 
contactless sensors (33), which can be activated by a 

glue assembly (14) in such a way that the packaging 
machine works or the maintenance station can be operated 

only when the glue assembly is present.
