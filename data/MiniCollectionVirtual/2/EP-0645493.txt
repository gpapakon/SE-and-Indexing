<ABSTRACT>
A drilling machine for railroad rail in which a railroad 
rail (8) is clamped crosswise with respect to a main body case (1) by 

a clamp means comprising a locating frame (6) and a clamp arm (7); a 
cutter (2) is advanced perpendicularly with respect to the middle 

part of a rail (8a) by turning the rotating handle (16a) of a link 
mechanism (16) to drill boltholes (13) in specific positions; and the 

drilling position of the bolthole (13) to be drilled in the middle 
part of the rail (8a) is set by means of height gauge (10), secured 

on locating frame (6), and pitch gauge 20, mounted on railroad 
rail (8).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to drilling apparatus and drilling
machines, and particularly concerns a device for drilling boltholes for
the fastening of connecting plates or fishplates between abutting railroad
rails during the laying and repair of railroad track.Connecting plates are positioned for reinforcement on railroad
rails and fastened to them with bolts during the laying of railroad track
and the replacement of worn track. During this process, a specified
number of boltholes is drilled in the central web of the rail, but since
the drilling height and pitch of the bolt insertion holes on the
connecting plates are predetermined for each type of rail, holes must be
drilled in the rails to match the bolt insertion holes on the connecting
plates.The conventional method of drilling boltholes in railroad rails
was to first determine the position of the holes to be drilled in each
rail and then make punch marks, after which a drill was directed to the
marks and the holes were drilled. Marking and punching each rail is
time-consuming and tedious, and the heavy drilling machine is cumbersome.
There is thus a demand for a drilling machine capable of simple and rapid
operation particularly needed when changing railroad rails in emergencies.There is known from US-A-4 753 556 a drilling apparatus for
repeatedly drilling holes in elongate workpieces, especially a portable
rail drill and a light-weight clamping mechanism for securing the
apparatus to the rail.The object of the present invention is to provide a drilling
apparatus and a drilling machine for railroad rails which requires none of
the marking and punching of conventional rail drilling procedures, and
which permits simple and rapid adjustment of the drilling machine on, and
drilling of, all types of rail.According to the present invention there is provided a drilling
apparatus for forming transverse bores through the vertical web of a
railroad rail, comprising clamping means formed by a locating frame having
abutments positioned to engage the surface of the rail at spaced 
locations, a clamping jaw movable relative to the locating frame, a pair
of parallel bars extending from the locating frame in a direction
perpendicular to the web of the rail when the locating frame engages the
rail, and a body mounted to the bars for reciprocal sliding motion
therealong, the body including drive means and a drilling cutter
engageable with the rail web to form an opening therein, wherein said
clamping jaw is pivotable relative to the locating frame , and wherein

A drilling apparatus for forming transverse bores through the
vertical web of a railroad rail, comprising clamping means formed by a

locating frame (6) having abutments positioned to engage the surface of
the rail at spaced locations, a clamping jaw (7) movable relative to the

locating frame, a pair of parallel bars (5) extending from the locating
frame in a direction perpendicular to the web of the rail when the

locating frame engages the rail, and a body (1) mounted to the bars for
reciprocal sliding motion therealong, the body including drive means (3)

and a drilling cutter (2) engageable with the rail web to form an opening
therein characterised in that said clamping jaw (7) is pivotable

relative to the locating frame, and

A drilling apparatus according to Claim 1, characterised in that
a pitch gauge (20) is provided fixable to the rail and having a plurality

of locating recesses (21) spaced in the axial direction of the rail,
wherein the locating frame (6) or the clamping jaw (7) includes an

embossment or projection sequentially cooperable with the locating
recesses to fix the drilling apparatus in a plurality of axially spaced

locations along the rail.
