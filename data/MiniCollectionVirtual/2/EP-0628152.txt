<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a method of destroying explosive substances in which the explosive substances are converted to a pumpable liquid or suspension which is not detonatable but combustible and which can be burned in conventional boilers intended for energy production. The explosive substance is dissolved or suspended in a combustible liquid which contains no available oxygen or only a small amount of available oxygen, preferably fuel oil, wherein the amount of liquid present is so large as to reduce the energy content of the mixture to 1 MJ/kg or less in the absence of available atmospheric oxygen. The mixture is burned in a combustion apparatus, by delivering the mixture to the combustion apparatus via a liquid fuel burner or a burner for solid fuel/liquid fuel suspensions. The grain size of the explosive substance in suspension is selected so that each grain will be incinerated during its residence time in the flame of the burner concerned.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method of destroying explosive substances, 
and more specifically to a method of destroying explosive substances 
by combustion in a combustion apparatus. Large quantities of supernumerary, out-of-date and functionally deficient 
or otherwise unusable ammunition are destroyed each year. The quantities 
concerned are significant and constitute several hundreds to 
several thousands of tonnes per year and nation. Earlier, ammunition was 
dumped in lakes or oceans, or exploded or burned in the open air on 
firing ranges or the like. It is no longer permitted to dump ammunition 
in lakes or oceans. Destroying by explosive processes on a large scale 
requires extensive safety distances, among other things because of the 
noise that is generated thereby, therewith placing a geographic limitation 
on the use of this method. Similar to explosive processes, the 
burning of explosive substances in the open air releases reaction products 
which are environmentally harmful, for instance such products as 
carbon monoxide and nitrogen oxides. Attempts have earlier been made to incinerate explosive substances in a 
solid form (lumps) in furnaces, such as cement kilns, which although 
enabling the flue gases to be cleaned also incurs the risk of explosion 
due to agglomeration of explosive substances. Furthermore, when the 
explosive substances are charged to the furnace in a solid state, it is 
difficult to control the flow of explosive substances in a manner which 
will enable the flue gases to be cleaned effectively. The handling of 
solid explosive substances, in powder or lump form, see for example document US-A-3 916 805, according to the preamble of independent claim 1 is also combined 
with the risk of explosion. An object of the present invention is to destroy explosive substances 
by incineration in a combustion apparatus in a safe manner. Another object of the invention is to destroy explosive substances by 
incineration in a manner which will enable the combustion gases to be 
cleaned effectively. Yet another object of the invention is to destroy explosive substances 
by incineration in a manner which will enable the energy content of the 
explosive substances to be utilized.  
 These objects are achieved with an inventive method defined in the 
Claims. The inventive method comprises dissolving or suspending the explosive 
substance in a combustible liquid which has no available oxygen or only 
a small amount of available oxygen, wherein the proportion of liquid 
used is

explosive substance to be destroyed is firstly dissolved or suspended in a 

combustible liquid by obtaining and maintaining an homogenous mixture, wherein 
the combustible liquid has no available oxygen or only a small amount of available 

oxygen and the proportion of combustible liquid used is so large as to reduce the 
energy content of the mixture to 1 MJ/kg or less in the absence of available 

atmospheric oxygen; and that said mixture is burnt in a combustion apparatus by 
delivering the mixture to said combustion apparatus via a liquid fuel burner or a 

burner for solid fuel/liquid fuel suspensions.
