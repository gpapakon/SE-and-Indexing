<ABSTRACT>
Vacuum dryer device (10) comprising at least a heatable work
surface (12), on which the product to be dried is suitable

to be arranged, and cover means which can be coupled with
said work surface (12) so as to define an air-tight chamber

inside which a depression is created, a condensation
apparatus being included comprising at least a bundle of

tubes (27) wherein cooling fluid circulates, cooperating
with each work surface (12), said bundle of tubes (27)

comprising inlet collectors (28a) and outlet collectors
(28b) connected to each other by respective conduits (29),

said bundle of tubes (27) having a substantially rectilinear
longitudinal development extending substantially for the

entire length of the relative work surface (12), said inlet
collector (28a) and said outlet collector (28b) being

arranged axially aligned with each other in correspondence
with two opposite sides (12d) of the relative work surface

(12).

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention concerns a vacuum dryer device as set forth
in the main claim.The invention is used to eliminate water, liquids or
humidity from products of different nature, and particularly
to dry skins which have undergone industrial processing such
as, for example, dyeing.The state of the art includes various devices used to dry
skins; among these, those of the vacuum dryer type are
greatly appreciated by businessmen working in this field due
to the rapidity of the work cycle and because they preserve
the peculiarities of the skin treated.The functioning of said vacuum dryer devices is based on
the fact that the skin is simultaneously heated and
subjected to depression, so as to facilitate and accelerate
the removal of liquids in the form of steam which is then
condensed and discharged.Conventional vacuum dryer devices include at least one
work surface equipped with heating means and a cover, and
can have one or more superimposed work surfaces.The skin to be dried is laid on the heated work surface
and then pressed by the cover or by the overlying work
surface which, as it closes, forms an air-tight chamber
inside which the vacuum is created by means of a pump.The cover cooperates with mesh-type filter means to allow
the passage and discharge, in the form of steam, of the
liquids removed.The steam removed is made to pass through a condensation
apparatus with bundles of tubes inside which a cooling fluid
(normally cold water) circulates and cools the steam, making 
it condense. The bundles of tubes comprise a delivery
collector and a return collector inside which the cooling
fluid is respectively introduced into and discharged from
the bundle of tubes.In conventional dryer devices, the delivery and return
collectors are arranged on the same side of the work
surfaces.For this reason, each bundle of tubes comprises a
plurality of delivery conduits which cross the work surface
in one direction, and a plurality of return conduits which
cross the work surface in the opposite direction.This travel of the cooling fluid causes a plurality of
disadvantages concerning mainly the considerable load losses
which occur inside the bundle of tubes due to the inversion
of flow of the cooling fluid.This entails a reduction in the delivery and therefore of
the speed at which the cooling liquid circulates, with a
reduced capacity to remove heat and therefore a reduction in
performance of the condensation apparatus.In its return travel, moreover, the cooling fluid has
already acquired heat from the steam which has to be
