<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a device with telescopic tubular parts (1, 2) in the form of hollow rods which can be locked together at different depths of insertion by means of a catch element (4) held in the locked position by the force of a spring (3) and, at their free ends, each have a socket (5) for the outer sleeve of the actuating cable, which extends through the tubular part (1, 2) in the form of a hollow rod. In order to allow rapid adjustment without the risk of overloading of the brake cable, a sleeve-shaped part (7) can be pushed over the tubular part (1, 2) in the form of a hollow rod and is connected to the tubular part (2), the sleeve-shaped part (7) having, in the region of the part (1) in the form of a hollow rod, a conical contact surface (8) against which the catch element (4), which is of annular design and is pushed over the part (1) in the form of a hollow rod, slides with a radially outer contact surface (9) and is held in the locked position on the part (1) in the form of a hollow rod by means of the compression spring (3).

Device for length adjustment of flexible mechanical remote actuators 
or the like, in particular for brake cable pulls of motor vehicles, with 

a part (1) in the shape of a hollow rod and a tubular part (2), which are 
pushable one into the other and fixable each relative to the other in 

different depths of insertion, wherein the part (1) in the shape of a 
hollow rod at its free end displays a receptacle (5) for the outer 

sleeve of the actuating pull, the inner pull of which extends through the 
part (1) in the shape of a hollow rod and the tubular part (2), a sleeve-shaped 

part (7) is pushed over the part (1) in the shape of a hollow rod 
and the tubular part (2) and the sleeve-shaped part (7) for fixing at the 

part (1) in the shape of a hollow rod displays a conical bearing surface 
(8), which is in the region of this part (1) in the shape of a hollow rod 

and at which an annularly shaped detent element (4), which is pushed over 
the part (1) in the shape of a hollow rod, slides by a radially outer 

conical bearing surface (9) and is retained in detent setting at the part 
(1) in the shape of a hollow rod by means of a compression spring (3), 

characterised thereby, that the tubular part (2) at its free end displays 
a receptacle (5) for the outer sleeve of the actuating pull, the 

compression spring (3) is fixed at its one end with respect to the 
sleeve-shaped part (7), the sleeve-shaped part (7) and the tubular part 

(2) are connected together by means of a screw connection (10) and the 
tubular part (2) displays a prolongation (11) or - in a given case - an 

intermediate member, by means of which the detent element (4) in the case 
of a corresponding screw-in d
epth of the tubular part (2) into the 
sleeve-shaped part (7) comes out of engagement with detent means (12) of 

the part (1) in the shape of a hollow rod. 
Device according to claim 1, characterised thereby, that the part (1) 
in the shape of a hollow rod is insertable by its one end into a recess 

(6) of the tubular part (2). 
Device according to one of the claims 1 and 2, characterised thereby, 
that the sleeve-shaped part (7) is rotatable relative to the part (1) in 

the shape of a hollow rod.  
 
Device according to one or more of the preceding claims, 
characterised thereby, that a securing element (13) is provided, which 

limits the screw-in depth of the tubular part (2) and which is retained 
at the sleeve-shaped part (7) or at the tubular part (2) to be 

detachable. 
Device according to one or more of the preceding claims, 
characterised thereby, that the detent means (15) of the detent element 

(4) are formed as detent toothing and counterdetent means of the part (1) 
in the shape of a hollow rod are executed as radial toothing. 
Device according to one or more of the preceding claims, 
characterised thereby, that the parts (1, 2, 7), which are in the shape 

of a hollow rod, tube and/or sleeve, are sealed off one against the other 
to be dust-tight and/or liquid-tight. 
Device according to one or more of the preceding claims, 
characterised thereby, that a sealing ring (17), which is preferably 

made in a composite of elastomer and metal and engaged behind at its free 
end by a beaded-over rim (18) of the sleeve-shaped part (7) and against 

which the compression spring (3) acting on the detent element (4) acts in 
a given case, is arranged in the region of the part (1) in the shape of a 

hollow rod. 
Device according to one or more of the preceding claims, 
characterised thereby, that the tubular part (2) on its outer envelope 

displays a marking (22) fixing the mid-position of the fine adjustment. 
Device according to one or more of the preceding claims, 
characterised thereby, that the sleeve-shaped part (7) on its outer 

envelope displays a grooving, knurling (16) or the like means for 
improving the grip.  

 
Device according to one or more of the preceding claims, 
characterised thereby, that the part (1) in the shape of a hollow rod at 

its end lying opposite the receptacle (5) displays an abutment cooperating 
with the detent element (4) against a pulling of the part (1) 

in the shape of a hollow rod out of the detent toothing (15) of the detent 
element. 
Device according to one or more of the preceding claims, 
characterised thereby, that the detent element (4) is formed of several 

circle segments which lie against the conical bearing surface (8) of the 
sleeve-shaped part (7) and which are retained in detent position at the 

part (1) in the shape of a hollow rod by means of the compression spring 
(3).
