<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a fluid mass flowmeter.Fluid mass flowmeters are known for providing an output
representative of the mass flow of a target fluid through a conduit.
The known flowmeters comprise a transducer for location in the
conduit, means for supplying heating power to the transducer, means
for measuring the rate at which power is supplied to the transducer,
means for measuring the temperature of the fluid within the conduit,
means for measuring the temperature of the transducer, and means for
calculating the mass flow from the measured rate of power supply,
fluid temperature and transducer temperature. The underlying
principle of operation is that, the greater the rate of flow, the
greater is the rate of heat loss from the transducer.The known flowmeters once calibrated provide accurate results.
Unfortunately calibration is a major problem and the calibration
process represents a large proportion of the cost of flowmeters which
are generally delivered to the end user calibrated for a specific target
gas. Typically, the end user specifies to the flowmeter supplier the
identity of the target gas or mixture of gases, operating parameters
such as minimum and maximum flow rates, and the required meter
accuracy. The manufacturer calibrates the flowmeter by obtaining a
supply of the target gas or mixture of gases and running that supply
through a test rig to which the flowmeter is connected. In this way
calibration data is obtained directly in a test environment which is a
near as possible identical to the intended conditions of use of the
flowmeter.The above calibration procedure is easy to execute if the target
gas is air. It is also relatively easy to execute if the target gas is
a readily available inert gas which can be purchased at a relatively
low price and can be handled using simple procedures. Where the
target gas is not readily available, or is for example potentially
explosive or poisonous and therefore must be handled with great care,
the test procedures become very expensive and inconvenient.The transducers which are used in the known flowmeters
generally have a cylindrical outer wall which is in contact with the 
target gas. There has been much research into heat loss from
cylinders in gas flows and this indicates that there is no simple
relationship that is independent of the nature of the target gas.
Fortunately, the available literature has been thoroughly surveyed in
the document "The Overall Convective Heat Transfer from Smooth
Circular Cylinders" by V. T. Morgan. PP199
