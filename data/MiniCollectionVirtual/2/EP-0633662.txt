<ABSTRACT>
A ring oscillator circuit has two series circuits of 'n' drive stages (1-3, 4-6). Interconnections are made between drive stages in the form of inverters (7-12). The combination of drive stages and inverters is assigned to oscillator stages (1, 4, 7, 8, etc.). Outputs from the final stage are cross coupled back to the inputs of the first drive stages. The drive stages are formed from FET devices. The signals are generated with flattened flanks to reduce the unwanted electromagnetic radiation.
