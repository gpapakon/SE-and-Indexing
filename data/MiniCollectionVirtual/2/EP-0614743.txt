<ABSTRACT>
Injection molding apparatus for valve gating in 
which the valve member (80) extends through a locating insert (42) 

mounted at the front end (30) of the nozzle (14). The locating 
insert (42) has a pair of spiral blades (104) extending inwardly from 

an outer collar (100). The spiral blades (104) have curved inner 
edges (108) 

which encircle the valve member (80) sufficiently to maintain 
the valve member (80) in accurate alignment with the gate (16) as it 

reciprocates between the open and closed positions.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates generally to injection
molding and more particularly to valve gated apparatus
having a locating insert mounted at the front end of each
nozzle having an inwardly extending spiral blade or blades
to accurately locate the reciprocating valve member in
alignment with the gate.Valve gated injection molding with actuating
mechanism connected to the rear end of the valve member is
well known. Often the valve member is located in alignment
with the gate by the bore where it passes through the
manifold and a sealing bushing near its rear end. An
example of this is shown in U.S. Patent number 5,022,846 to
Schmidt which issued June 11, 1991. However, this has the
disadvantage that the location of the reciprocating valve
member is not always maintained sufficiently accurately,
particularly if the gate is cylindrical.It is also known to provide three inwardly
extending locating pins or fins to guide the valve member
near its front end. An example of this is shown at page 43
of D-M-E brochure OVG2 entitled "D-M-E/OSCO Valve Gate 
Runnerless Molding Systems." While this improves location
of the valve member, the pins or straight fins have the
disadvantage that flow lines can be produced in the product
by the melt parting to flow past the locating pins or fins.A nozzle tip having spiral channels extending
around the valve member to impart a swirling motion to the
melt entering the cavity is also known. This is seen in
the applicants' U.S. patent number 4,303,382 which issued
December 1, 1981.JP-A-03069327 shows an injection molding apparatus in accordance
with the preamble of claim 1.Accordingly, it is an object of the present
invention to at least partially overcome the disadvantages
of the prior art by providing valve gated injection molding
apparatus having a locating insert mounted at the front end
of the nozzle having at least one inwardly extending spiral
blade to accurately locate the reciprocating valve member
in alignment with the gate.To this end, in one of its aspects, the invention
provides valve gated injection molding apparatus according
to claim 1. Further objects and advantages of the invention
will appear from the following description taken together 
with the accompanying drawings.Figure 1 is a sectional view of a portion of a
multi-cavity valve gated injection molding system showing
apparatus according to a preferred embodiment of the
invention, andFigure 2 is a cut away isometric view showing the
valve member extending through the locating insert seen in

<CLAIMS>
Injection molding apparatus to convey melt to a gate
(16) extending through a mold (20) to a cavity (18)

comprising a heated nozzle having an outer surface (26),
a rear end (28), a front end (30), a melt bore (32)

extending longitudinally therethrough from the rear end
to the front end, and a seat (44) extending around the

melt bore at the front end, the nozzle seated in a well
(70) having an inner surface (78) in the mold with an

insulative air space (76) extending between the outer
surface (26) of the nozzle and the inner surface (78) of

the well in the mold, an elongated valve member (80)
having a cylindrical outer surface (82) mounted to

extend centrally in the melt bore (32) through the
nozzle, and valve member actuating means connected to

the valve member whereby the valve member is
reciprocated between an open position wherein the melt

flows through the gate from the melt bore into the
cavity (18) and a closed position wherein the gate is

sealed off by the valve member, which is positioned by a

valve member locating insert while at least one spiral
blade is provided to impart a swirling motion to the

melt, 
characterized in that
 said valve member locating
insert (42) comprises an outer collar (100) and at least

one spiral blade (104) attached thereto, said spiral
blade extending inwardly from the outer collar (100),

forming a curved inner surface (108) with said valve
member (80) slideably received therein with the curved

inner surface (108) of the at least one spiral blade
(104) encircling the valve member (80) sufficiently to

locate and maintain the valve member in accurate 
alignment with the gate (16) as the valve member

reciprocates and melt flows around the valve member and
through the locating insert (42) past the at least one

spiral blade. 
Injection molding apparatus as claimed in claim
1 wherein the locating insert has a pair of spiral blades

extending symmetrically inward from the collar to encircle
the valve member.
Injection molding apparatus as claimed in claim
2 wherein the seat at the front end of the nozzle has a

threaded inner surface, the outer collar of the locating
insert has an intermediate portion extending between a

threaded cylindrical rear portion and cylindrical front
portion, the intermediate portion being engageable to

removably screw the cylindrical rear portion of the outer
collar into the seat at the front end of the nozzle, and

the cylindrical front portion of the outer collar being 
received in a circular opening in the mold whereby the

outer collar bridges the insulative space extending between
the nozzle and the mold.
Injection molding apparatus as claimed in claim
3 wherein the engageable intermediate portion of the outer

collar of the locating insert has an outer surface with a
plurality of flat surfaces.
