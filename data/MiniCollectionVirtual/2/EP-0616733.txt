<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method and 
apparatus for selectively oxidizing the carbon 
monoxide present in a mixture of gases, including 
hydrogen, to carbon dioxide. In the present 
invention, oxygen or an oxygen-containing gas 
-mixture is introduced at locations along the latter 
portion of the isothermal reaction chamber 
containing catalyst to selectively oxidize the 
carbon monoxide to carbon dioxide and to suppress 
the reverse water-shift reaction, which produces 
carbon monoxide and water from carbon dioxide and 
hydrogen. Electrochemical fuel cells convert fuel and 
oxidant to electricity and reaction product. In 
electrochemical fuel cells employing hydrogen as 
the fuel and oxygen as the oxidant, the reaction 
product is water. Recently, efforts have been 
devoted to identifying ways to operate 
electrochemical fuel cells using other than pure 
hydrogen as the fuel. Fuel cell systems operating 
on pure hydrogen are generally disadvantageous 
because of the expense of producing and storing 
pure hydrogen gas. In addition, the use of liquid 
fuels is preferable to pure, bottled hydrogen in 
mobile and vehicular applications of 
electrochemical fuel cells.  
 Recent efforts have focused on the use of 
impure hydrogen obtained from the chemical 
conversion of hydrocarbon fuels to hydrogen. 
However, to be useful for fuel cells and other 
similar hydrogen-based chemical applications, 
hydrocarbon fuels must be efficiently converted to 
relatively pure hydrogen with a minimal amount of 
undesirable chemical byproducts, such as carbon 
monoxide. Conversion of hydrocarbons to hydrogen is 
generally accomplished through the steam 
reformation of a hydrocarbon such as methanol in a 
reactor sometimes referred to as a reformer. The 
steam reformation of methanol is represented by the 
following chemical equation: 
CH₃OH + H₂O + heat = 3 H₂ + CO₂Due to competing reactions, the initial 
gaseous mixture produced by steam reformation of 
methanol typically contains from about 0.5% to 
about 20% by volume of carbon monoxide and about 
65% to about 75% hydrogen, along with about 10% to 
about 25% carbon dioxide, on a dry basis (in 
addition, water vapor can be present in the gas 
stream). The initial gas mixture produced by the 
steam reformer can be further processed by a shift 
reactor (sometimes called a shift converter) to 
reduce the carbon monoxide content to about 0.2% to 
about 2%. The catalyzed reaction occurring in the 
shift converter is represented by the following 
chemical equation:
