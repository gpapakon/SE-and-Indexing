<ABSTRACT>
The invention concerns reinforcing rings comprising a bearing ring (3) that is made of an insulating material which is compression proof even at high working temperatures and a metal clamping ring (4) into which the bearing ring is fitted to form a double body; said reinforcing rings are used in electric motor collectors with lamellar inner webs (6) that are used for bracing the individual lamellae, that project inward running at least predominantly parallel to the collector axis (2) and that have undercut surfaces (8, 7) for rear engagement by the reinforcing rings. In this way reinforcing rings can be made from two subrings that are simple to manufacture and simple to press together, or by using an injection process to insert the bearing ring in the clamping ring, thus forming a unit of extremely high thermal and mechanical load-bearing capacity and giving the collector a very high stability and fatigue strength.

A commutator for an electric motor with, distributed fanwise
on the periphery, copper bars (5) which have inner webs (6)

comprising undercuts and by which they are anchored in an
insulating carrier made from a moulded synthetic plastics

composition, there being enclosed in the carrier a
reinforcing ring (1,19,27,22,16) surrounding at least one

metallic clamping ring (4,20,23,28), the carrier engaging
around the inner webs at extensions in the area of the

undercuts and which has an insulating intermediate layer at
least on its inside face which is towards the extensions,


characterised in that
 the intermediate layer consists of a
bracing ring (3,17,24,29,30) of an insulating material which

is compression resistant even at high working temperatures
and which is made to fit the clamping ring (4,20,23,28) and

which forms a double member with the clamping ring
(4,20,23,28).

characterised in that
 the
bracing ring (3,17,24,29,30) consists of an insulating

material which is compression resistant at temperatures
above 250°C.

characterised in that
 the bracing ring (3,17,24,29,30)
consists of a highly-filled composite material with

insulating compression resistant and high temperature
resistant material fractions.
A commutator according to Claim 6, 
characterised in that
 the
bracing ring (3,17,24,29,30) consists of a highly-filled

composite fibre material in which the fibres bear
substantially rigidly on one another.

characterised in that
 the
composite fibre body consists of a wound body which is wound

under high tension.

characterised in that
 the fibres are at least for the most
part glass fibres.
A commutator according to one of Claims 1 to 10,

characterised in that
 the bracing ring (3,17,24,29,30)
projects axially and at least on one side beyond the

clamping ring (4,20,23,28). 
A commutator according to Claim 11, 
characterised in that,

on the other side, the clamping ring (4) projects axially
beyond the bracing ring (3) and bears axially against this

latter via an abutment shoulder (15).
