<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a stopper
integral type bottle cap made of soft and hard
synthetic resin, and more particularly to a highly
hermetically sealing synthetic resin made bottle cap
capable of using without receiving any limitation for
carbonated or non-carbonated beverage and which can be used
to easily open the bottle without any opener and
excellent in sealing effect.It is known to use caps of various beverage bottles or
bottles for filling alcoholic liquors made by
steel or aluminum.In case of caps made of steel, the cap can be
taken off from a bottle only having to necessarily use
an opener, and in the distributing course, since the
cap is easily oxidized and corroded, not only it is bad
in hygienic but also unpleasantness is given to a
consumer in visual as well and hence value of commodity
is fallen.And, in case of caps made of aluminum, it has
the advantage that the cap can be taken off from the bottle
without separate opener, but after the cap is taken off 
from the bottle, a portion of that cap taken off from the bottle is very sharp and it has a
worry about to hurt a finger, and the aluminium itself is expensive but its strength is
weak whereby the sealing effect is reduced, therefore it has limitation in use that it is
almost not in use for the carbonated beverage bottle and mainly can be used for a cap of
non-carbonated beverage or alcohol bottle and the like.And, the cap made of steel or aluminium as above is more than one hundred
years in all in their oxidising speed and is semi-permanent, therefore in case being
thrown away around near place, they have been also a principal offender polluting a
peripheral environment or soil.French Patent No. 1600882 describes a plastic bottle cap according to the first part of claim 1 having a top surface
portion, a side surface portion and a stopper integrally formed at its centre and passing
into the interior of a bottle. A cut out portion is provided across the side and top
surfaces of the bottle cap with a pulling tab integrally formed at the end of the cut out
portion. The sides of the cap pass around the edge of the bottle to define a circular
inserting groove between the sides of the cut out portion and the stopper.Swiss Patent No. 442056 shows a plastic bottle cap having a top surface portion
and a side surface portion which passes around the edge of a bottle to define a circular
inserting groove between the side surface portion and an integrally formed stopper
passing into the interior of the bottle. A cut out portion is provided
