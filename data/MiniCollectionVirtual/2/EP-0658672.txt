<ABSTRACT>
A remote-control key (1) for use in a remote-control system 
is provided with a transmission circuit (4) in a key grip (3) and used 

for transmitting an atmospheric propagation signal as an 
locking or unlocking signal containing an ID code. When the 

key (1) is inserted into an IG key cylinder and detected by an IG 
key position switch (8), a control unit (7) on the automobile side is 

adapted to accepting the atmospheric propagation signal 
received via an antenna (7a) for a predetermined period, verifying 

the ID code, outputting a signal for effecting an engine-starting 
operation when the key is proper, and permitting an 

engine being started. It is thus prevented to start the engine 
unlawfully with a mechanically-copied key.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to an automobile engine starter
according to the preamble part of claim 1.Such an engine starter is described in "RF transponder
embedded in auto ignition keys stymies car thieves" by Milt
Leonard (Electronic Design, vol. 41, no. 25, 2 December 1993,
Hasbrouck Heights, New Jersey USA, pp. 35-36). This document
discloses an RF registration and identification system which
comprises an RF reader mounted in a steering column and an RF
transponder in an auto ignition key. When the ignition key is
inserted and turned the reader continuously sends out an RF
pulse. The transponder's antenna picks up the pulse
transmissions from the reader and stores the charge in a
capacitor. After a 1 ms delay, the transponder transmits its
unique code which is stored in an EEPROM by means of a
frequency-modulated RF signal back to the reader. The reader
compares this code with its own code. If the codes match, the
module activates either the fuel-pump relays or the car's
electronic engine control. The entire transaction occurs in
less than a second. If, on the other hand, the reader does not
receive the correct signal from the transponder when the
ignition key is turned, the car's fuel systems won't function.An automobile engine starter of the sort stated above
is designed to check a key inserted into an ignition key
cylinder to see if it is a right key so as to justify the
attempt to start the engine when it is the right one or vitiate
the attempt when it is a wrong one, and further to perform the
operation of informing those around an automobile of an
unlawful act being committed by issuing warning, for example. In order to decide whether the key inserted in the
ignition key cylinder is right or wrong in that case, there is
a known arrangement in which the key plate of a key is
furnished with a resistor having a specific resistance, whereas
an ignition key cylinder is fitted with a detector or the like
for reading the resistance of the resistor provided therein
when the key is inserted.Another arrangement that has been proposed is to
provide a resonance circuit having a specific frequency in the
key grip of a key so that resonance may occur at the specific 
frequency, and a detecting device for reading the resonance
frequency of the resonance circuit of the key.A resistance and a resonance frequency are respectively
set in the resistor and the resonance circuit on the key side
as a physical quantity proper to an automobile, whereas the
device for detecting the physical quantity is installed on the
igni

<CLAIMS>
Automobile engine starter comprising:

transmission means for transmitting an atmospheric propagation signal
containing an identification code;
reception means (7a) for receiving the atmospheric propagation signal, the
reception means provided on a car body side;
key detecting means (8) for detecting the insertion of the key into an ignition
key cylinder, the key detecting means provided for the ignition key cylinder;

and
control means (7) for outputting an effecting signal for effecting the operation of
starting the automobile engine if the identification code contained in the

atmospheric propagation signal conforms to a prestored identification code;
characterized in that
 said control means are adapted to output said effecting signal only if the atmospheric
propagation signal is received during a period of time, said period of time

starting when the key detection means (8) generates a reception signal upon
the insertion of the key and ending either after a preset period of time or ending

when an IG Key ACC switch (9) detects that the key is turned.
