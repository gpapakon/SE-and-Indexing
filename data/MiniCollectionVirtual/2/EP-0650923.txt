Reactor for catalytically removing CO from gas rich in H
2
 with a 
selective CO oxidation catalyst containing precious metal, 


characterised in that
 the reactor is of a structure that produces a 
turbulent flow and is conducive to the transfer of heat, the structure 

being coated with the CO-oxidation catalyst. 
Reactor as claimed in claim 1, 
characterised in that
 the structure is a 
metal or ceramic support with a crossed-passage structure. 
Reactor as claimed in one of the preceding claims, 
characterised in 
that
 the structure is a metal or ceramic support with a sponge or fibre 
structure. 
Reactor as claimed in one of the preceding claims, 
characterised in 
that
 the reactor wall forms the structure. 
Reactor as claimed in one of claims 2 to 4, 
characterised in that
 the 
surface structure of the metal or ceramic support or the reactor wall 

is adapted to match the dimension of the catalyst powder. 
Reactor as claimed in one of the preceding claims, 
characterised in 
that
 the thickness of the layer of CO oxidation catalyst is determined 
by the concentration of CO at the input.  

 
Reactor as claimed in one of the preceding claims, 
characterised in 
that
 the CO oxidation catalyst is Pt/Al
2
O
3
. 
Reactor as claimed in claim 7, 
characterised in that
 the Pt-cluster of 
the catalyst powder is of a size in the range of 3 to 10 nm. 
Reactor as claimed in one of the preceding claims, 
characterised in 
that
 the CO oxidation catalyst is Ru/Al
2
O
3
 or Pt-zeolite. 
Application of the reactor in conjunction with a fuel cell, in particular 
for mobile applications.
