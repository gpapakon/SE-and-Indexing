Method of accelerating electrically charged particles from a pulsed
plasma reservoir of high particle density comprising the steps:


the particles are accelerated via an electrode system (2, 3) into a
dielectric tubular chamber (5) and in this dielectric tubular chamber (5)

and retained therein via an electrostatic focussing by means of a residual
gas filling present therein,
with an acceleration voltage of between 10 and 20 kV between the
two electrodes, a current density of between 10
3
 and 10
4
 A/cm
2
 and a
mean energy of the electrodes between 11 and 12 keV are achieved,

characterised by the additional method steps:
the residual gas pressure p in the dielectric tubular chamber (5) is
kept in the range of between 0.1 and 1.5 Pa, and the residual gas filling in

the tubular chamber (5) is ionised and electrically polarised by the
electrically charged particle stream (7),
the acceleration path in the tubular chamber (5) is shortened by an
auxiliary electrode (9), which is connected to the electrode (3) via a

resistor (10) or an inductance (10) and is mounted around the tubular
chamber (5), or the potential variation between the electrodes (2, 3) is set

via a voltage divider (6), auxiliary electrodes (13) lying around the tubular
chamber (5) being connected to the intermediate branches of said divider.
Particle accelerator for effecting the method according to claim 1,
comprising a pulsed source which delivers the charged particles, a

reservoir which is provided with the charged particles. and an acceleration
device, characterised in that 


at least one dielectric tubular chamber (5) is installed between two
electrodes (2, 3), of which one (2) partially defines the reservoir (1) and

the other (3) lies outside, said chamber beginning with an opening in the
electrode (2) and being directed towards the other electrode (3),
the dielectric tubular chamber (5), beginning at the electrode (2),
has a minimum length of three times its internal diameter,
to achieve the axial electrical insulation in the event of
contamination, the dielectric tubular chamber (5) between the two

electrodes (2, 3) is partially or wholly formed by a system of dielectric
tubular segments (16) which are disposed in alignment with one another

and are connected by an internally radially (or respectively
topologically optionally) slotted dielectric body (18, 19, 20) having an

aligned internal bore, so that internal surface streams cannot flow between
the tubular segments (16).
Particle accelerator according to claim 2, characterised in that the
radial or topologically opti
onal slotted configuration of the
dielectric body (18, 19, 20) additionally contains a depression (22), so that

the rear chamber, being connected after the depression, is protected from
contamination and surface conductivity.
Particle accelerator according to claim 3, characterised in that, at the
end of the dielectric tube (5) extending to the counterelectrode (3, 8), a gas

supply (24) can flow in the direction of the reservoir (1) as well as into the
receptacle (8) in which the counterelectrode (3, 8) is situated.
Particle accelerator according to claim 4, characterised in that a
small dielectric tube (27) is introduced into the gas supply pipe (25) 

between the tube end (24) and the gas source (26) to prevent a parasitic
gas discharge towards the gas source (26), said small tube having a

maximum internal diameter of Â½ d and being metallised or provided with
electrodes (28) on both sides at the end faces so that the electrode (28),

pointing towards the gas source (26), is earthed and the other floats freely.
Particle accelerator according to claim 2, characterised in that the
reservoir (1) is a pulsed solid plasma.
Particle accelerator according to claim 2, characterised in that the
source is a pulsed hollow cathode, and the reservoir (1) is a hollow

cathode plasma.
Particle accelerator according to claim 2, characterised in that, in
the case of a potentially high reservoir chamber (1), a trigger plasma (29)

or particle streams of low energy is conducted through the dielectric
tubular chamber (30), with a substantially identical internal diameter and

identical length as the accelerator tube, into the reservoir chamber (1).
Particle accelerator according to claim 8, characterised in that the
dielectric tube (30), which the trigger plasma (29) or the particle streams

of low energy transports or transport into the reservoir chamber, is earthed
at the other end via a resistor (32), so that the secondary discharge to the

trigger source (31) can cause no damage.
