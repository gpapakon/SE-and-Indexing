<ABSTRACT>
A dispenser (1) for simultaneously dispensing and mixing 
a pair of fluid products (50,52) such as chemically reactive resins, 

from a pair of axial adjacent front and rear chambers (15,16). A 
piston is mounted within each of the chambers (15,16) and is moveable 

with respect to the hollow interior of the respective chamber 
for dispensing the fluid product (50,52) therefrom. Telescopic 

movement of the rear chamber (16) within the front chamber moves 
the pistons synchronously through the chambers (15,16) to provide for 

controlled discharge of the products (50,52) through a front discharge 
nozzle (12). A fixed hollow delivery tube extends through the 

interior of the front chamber and telescopically receives 
therein a post which is mounted on a rear wall of the rear 

chamber (16). The rear chamber (16) has a relatively tight sliding fit 
within the front chamber (15) so that a partial vacuum is formed 

within an annular space (55) which forms between the two pistons 
as they move apart upon discharge of the two products (50,52) to 

produce a "suck back" effect on product remaining in the 
discharge nozzle (12).

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to dispensing a plurality of 
fluid materials, which when mixed together chemically react 
to produce a desired end product such as an adhesive, potting 
compound, sealer, encapsulant or the like. More particularly, 
the invention relates to a dispenser for dispensing two fluid 
products in preset amounts, which products are maintained 
separate until they are mixed prior to being discharged from 
the dispenser through a nozzle. Various types of dispensers have been developed for 
dispensing a plurality of fluid materials such as chemically 
reactive resins, or a resin and a hardener, which products 
must be maintained out of contact with each other within the 
dispenser so that when mixed, they chemically react to form 
a final product. It is desirable that the dispenser dispenses 
the two products in a preset accurately controlled 
relationship to ensure that the proper chemical reaction takes 
place when forming the final product, since the final product 
can be greatly affected by an unbalanced ratio of the two 
component products. It is desirable for many applications that the 
dispenser be a relatively simple and inexpensive device, which 
preferably can be discarded after discharge of the two 
components, thereby making it suitable for jobshops, 
residential users, and the like. Therefore, when intended for 
use in such applications, the user will normally be unskilled 
in the dispensing art and will not be concerned with or about, 
nor experienced in the correct mixing of the two components 
in forming the final product. Therefore, it is necessary that  
 
upon operation of the dispenser, the two products are mixed 
in the desired relationship without requiring any skill on the 
part of the dispenser operator. Examples of the most pertinent prior art dispensers 
with respect to the dispenser of the present invention are 
shown in the following patents. US-A-4,014,463, 
which represents the prior art as referred to in the preamble of 
claim 1, 
discloses a dual component 
dispenser which uses a hollow delivery tube which extends 
through a flexible sealing disc at the forward end so that the 
discharged contents from one of the chambers mixes with the 
second product discharged from the second chamber at a static 
mixer nozzle. US-A-4,050,612 discloses a dispenser 
containing two different materials such as creams, wherein an 
upper chamber is telescopically slidably mounted and moved 
into a lower chamber for simultaneously discharging products 
from each of the containers
</DESCRIPTION>
<CLAIMS>
A dual product dispenser including: 

first and second chambers (15,16) having hollow interiors, 
each of said chambers (15,16) having a piston 
(40,33) for discharging a first and a second product 

(50,52) respectively, from the interiors of said 
chambers (15,16), 
said second chamber (16) being slidably mounted 
within the interior of the first chamber (15) wherein 

movement of the second chamber (16) effects synchronous 
movement of both pistons (40,33) with respect 

to their respective chambers (15,16) for discharging 
the products (50,52) therefrom, 
each of said chambers (15,16) having an exit port 
(37,43) through which the respective products 

(50,52) are discharged upon movement of the second 
chamber (16) into the first chamber (15), and 
a product delivery tube (30) extending through the 
interior of the first chamber (15), said delivery 

tube (30) having a first open end (41) communicating 
with the interior of the second chamber (16) and a 

second open end providing the exit port (43) for 
said second chamber (16), 
characterized by
 
an elongated post (45) mounted on the second chamber 

(16) and being movable into the delivery tube (30) 
of the first chamber (15) upon movement of the second 

chamber (16) into said first chamber (15). 
A dispenser as defined in claim 1 in which a mixer 
nozzle (12) communicates with the exit ports (37,43) 

of the first and second chambers (15,16) for receiving 
first and second products (50,52) upon discharge 

from the respective chambers (15,16). 
A dispenser as defined in claim 1 or 2 in which each 
of the chambers (15,16) has an elongated cylindrical 

outer wall (17,23), and in which said walls (17,23)

A dispenser as defined in one of claims 1-3 in which 
the second chamber piston (33) is fixedly mounted on

partition therebetween. 
A dispenser as defined in claim 4 in which an outer 
edge of the second chamber piston (33) forms an annular 

opening with the cylindrical wall (17) of the 
first chamber (15), and in which a free end of the
