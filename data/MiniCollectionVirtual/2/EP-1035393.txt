<ABSTRACT>
The continuous kiln for heat treatment of articles, such
as ceramic articles includes a controlled temperature

heat treatment chamber (3) designed for receiving
materials to be treated. A plurality of burners (4) are

associated to the heat treatment chamber (3), so as to
generate increasing temperatures thereinside. A roller

conveyor (5) extends between the inlet end (3a) and the
outlet end of the heat treatment chamber (3). The kiln

includes also means (6) for collecting exhaust fumes, and
releasing means (7), which communicate with said

collecting means (6), so as to expel the exhaust fumes in
the atmosphere. The collecting means (6) communicate with

the heat treatment chamber (3) in the region of intake
mouths (9a, 9b), situated in an intermediate area (3b) of

the heat treatment chamber (3). The intermediate area
(3b) has a constant temperature (T1) higher or equal to

the burning temperature of toxic and/or polluting
substances present inside the chamber (3).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to heat treatment of
articles for modifying and improving their physical and
structural characteristics.In particular, the present invention relates to an
improved continuous kiln for heat treatment of these
materials.Many articles of common use, as well as for particular
industrial use, must be heat treated, so as to define
and/or improve some of their physical and structural
characteristics.For instance, the heat treatment is necessary in
production of ceramic articles like tiles, sanitary
fixtures, or in production of components of sintered
ferrite used in electronics.Moreover, the heat treatment is used in many other cases
in which a high temperature treatment is required.There are also different types of kilns, in which heat
treatments are executed.One of the most used is the so-called continuous kiln,
i.e. a kiln, in which the heat treatment is gradual, the
material to be treated is introduced into a "cold" end of
the kiln, then it passes thereinside toward the hotter
And hotter areas and finally, it is withdrawn from the
"hot" end of the kiln.The temperature inside the kiln usually varies from about
300째C to above 1500째C.Actually, kilns of this type have usually the shape of a
modular tunnel and are equipped with a plurality of 
burners.The burners are spaced out along the tunnel, so as to
create a temperature gradient therealong, which increases
in a more or less linear way.This allows to obtain a gradual increase of the
temperature of the treated materials, which is
particularly advantageous for the treatment quality.The exhaust fumes are collected at the cold end of the
kiln, and then sent to a chimney to be dispersed in the
atmosphere.Substantially, a current is thus created, so as to carry
the exhaust fumes from the hot end of the kiln toward the
cold one, in direction opposite to the transport
direction of the materials being treated.In this way only a minimum quantity of heat is dispersed
in the atmosphere together with the exhaust fumes.A considerable disadvantage of the above described kiln
derives from the fact that exhaust fumes very often
contain highly toxic and/or polluting chemical
substances, produced in the kiln coldest area or released
by the materials during the first steps of heat
treatment.For instance, during tiles treatment, organic substances
present in the paints used for decorating the tiles or in
the glues used for the first decoration gluing, are
released.In fact, fixing agents containing polyglycolic substances
are very often used to

temperatures;
collecting means (6) which communicate with the inside of
said heat treatment chamber (3) and are aimed at

collecting exhaust fumes produced by said heat generating
means (4);
releasing means (7), which communicate with said
collecting means (6) and are aimed at receiving said

exhaust fumes therefrom and releasing them in the
atmosphere;
said kiln characterised in that said means (6) for
collecting the exhaust fumes communicate with said heat

treatment chamber (3) in the region of at least one
intake mouth (9a,9b), situated in an intermediate area

(3b) of said heat treatment chamber (3), with said
intermediate area (3b) having a constant temperature (T1)

higher or equal to the burning temperature of toxic
and/or polluting substances present inside said chamber

(3).
