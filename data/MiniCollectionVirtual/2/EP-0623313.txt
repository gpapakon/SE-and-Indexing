<ABSTRACT>
A sealed surgical stapling instrument (50) for performing 
a circular anastomosis stapling operation is provided. 

The surgical instrument (50) includes a stapling head assembly (60) 
mounted by a curved shaft (70) to an actuator handle assembly (80) 

and incorporates an improved actuator mechanism for 
transmitting the required operating forces and movements 

from the actuator handle assembly (80) through the curved shaft (70) 
to an anvil (100) and staple driver (62) of the stapling head 

assembly (60). Various mechanisms (72,76) for sealing the instrument (50) 
are disclosed.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention generally relates to
a surgical stapling instrument for applying surgical
staples to tissue and, more particularly, to a surgical
stapling instrument for performing a circular anastomosis
stapling operation. More specifically, this invention
relates to a surgical instrument in which a stapling head
assembly is mounted by a curved shaft to an actuator
handle assembly and to an improved actuator mechanism for
transmitting the required operating forces and movements
from the actuator handle assembly through the curved shaft
to the stapling head assembly. Also, this invention
relates to an improved stapling head assembly provided
with a detachable anvil and a retractable staple driver.
Further, this invention concerns an improved actuator
mechanism which permits adjustment of the anvil gap to
produce a desired staple height and precludes actuation of
the stapling head assembly if the anvil gap is outside of
a predetermined range.The field of surgical stapling has seen substantial
advances in the past decades. Specifically, in the area 
of internal anastomotic stapling the advances have been
quite dramatic. Devices such as the Proximate™ ILS
stapler, produced by the assignee of the present
invention, Ethicon, Inc., Somerville, New Jersey, have
enabled surgeons to perform operations and procedures
which were heretofore perceived as difficult, if not
impossible, with relative ease.Generally, in the performance of a surgical
anastomotic stapling operation, two pieces of lumen or
tubular tissue, e.g., intestinal tissue, are attached
together by a ring of staples. The two pieces of tubular
tissue may be attached end to end or one piece of tubular
tissue may be attached laterally around an opening formed
in the side of another piece of tubular tissue. In
performing the anastomosis with a stapling instrument, the
two pieces of tubular tissue are clamped together between
an anvil provided with a circular array of staple forming
grooves and a staple holder provided with a plurality of
staple receiving slots arranged in a circular array in
which the staples are received. A staple pusher is
advanced to drive the staples into the tissue and form the
staples against the anvil. Also, a circular knife is
advanced to cut the excess tissue clamped between the
anvil and the staple holder. As a result, a donut-shaped
section of tissue is severed from each lumen and remains
on the anvil shaft. The tubular tissue joined by the
circular ring of staples is unclamped by advancing the
anvil shaft distally to

<CLAIMS>
A surgical stapling instrument (50) for applying one or
more surgical staples (90) to tissue (52, 54), comprising


a stapling head assembly (60) including a staple holder
(68) for receiving one or more surgical staples (90), an

anvil (102) for clamping the tissue against said staple
holder, and driver means (62) for driving the staples from

said staple holder;
an actuator handle assembly (80) for actuating said
staple driver (62);
a shaft assembly with a generally hollow interior and
including a support shaft (70) for mounting said stapling

head assembly (60) on said actuator handle assembly (80);
and
a first transmission member (92) contained in said
support shaft (70) capable of transmitting work from said

handle assembly (80) to said stapling driver (62) ;

   characterised in that said instrument further includes
a first elastomeric seal (500) placed about said
transmission member (92) and against said hollow interior.
A surgical stapling instrument (50) according to
claim 1, wherein said transmission member (92) comprises a

compression member for transmitting a compressive force from
said actuator handle assembly (80) to advance said staple

driver (62) to drive the staples (90) from said staple
holder (68) into the tissue and to form the staples against

said anvil (102);

and wherein said instrument further comprises a tension
member (94) contained within said support shaft (70) for

transmitting tension from said actuator handle assembly (80)
to said anvil (102) to resist the forces exerted on said

anvil when the staples are formed;
said first elastomeric seal (500) being placed around
said tension (94) and compression (92) members.
A surgical stapling instrument according to claim 2, 
comprising a second elastomeric seal (600) placed around

said tension member (94) and held in place by said
compression member (92).
A surgical stapling instrument according to any of
claims 1 to 3, further comprising a shrink wrap plastic seal

(700) placed around said shaft assembly (70).
A surgical stapling instrument according to any
preceding claim, comprising


a casing (61) for supporting said stapling head assembly
(60), said casing including a hollow connector (64);
a ferrule (72) overlapping said support shaft (70) and
said connector (64), said ferrule being compressed radially

inward over said support shaft and said connector; and
an O-ring placed between said ferrule (72) and said
support shaft (70).
A surgical stapling instrument according to any
preceding claim, comprising


a tubular extension (74) at the distal end of said
handle assembly (80),
a ferrule (76) overlapping said support shaft (70) and
said tubular extension (74), said ferrule being compressed

radially inward over said support shaft and said tubular
extension; and
an O-ring placed between said ferrule and said support
shaft (70).
