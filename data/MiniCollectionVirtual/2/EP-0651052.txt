<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to particulate solid
machine dishwashing detergent compositions containing
a coated percarbonate bleach component, a bleach
activator component, an acidification agent and a
means for enabling delayed release of said
acidification agent into the wash solution.Detergent compositions designed for use in automatic
dishwasher machines are well known, and a consistent
effort has been made by detergent manufacturers to
improve the cleaning and/or rinsing efficiency of said
compositions on dishes and glassware, as reflected by
numerous patent publications.The inorganic perhydrate bleach most widely used in
machine dishwashing detergent compositions is sodium 
perborate in the form of either the monohydrate or
tetrahydrate. However, concerns about the impact of
boron salts on the environment have led to an
increasing interest in other perhydrate salts, of
which sodium percarbonate is the most readily
available.Detergent compositions containing sodium percarbonate
are known in the art. Sodium percarbonate is an
attractive perhydrate for use in detergent
compositions because it dissolves readily in water, is
weight efficient and, after giving up its available
oxygen, provides a source of carbonate ions to the
wash solution.The inclusion of percarbonate salts in detergent
compositions has been restricted hitherto by the relative
instability of such salts in the detergent matrix
environment. In particular, percarbonate salt components
of such detergent compositions decompose rapidly when
stored in moist and/or warm atmospheres. It is known that
acceptable storage characteristics may however be obtained
through the protection of the percarbonate by coating the
crystalline product, or by the inclusion of stabilizing
agents during its manufacture, or both. A variety of
suitable coating agents have been proposed including
silicates and mixtures of inorganic sulphate and carbonate
salts.Laundry washing and bleaching methods using compositions
containing a hydrogen peroxide source and peroxyacid bleach
precursor (bleach activator) and involving an initially
alkaline (e.g.: pH 10 - 11) wash solution, and delayed
release of acid into the wash solution to provide a final
wash solution of lower pH are known in the art, having been
disclosed for example, in EP-A-396,287 and EP-A-290,081. Hereinafter such washing methods are referred to generally
as 'controlled pH release washing methods'.It is desirable in controlled pH release washing methods
that release of the hydrogen peroxide into the wash
