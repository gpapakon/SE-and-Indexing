<ABSTRACT>
The vehicle roof folds into a compact storage behind the rear seat and occupies the forward part of the rear luggage space. A movable wall (6) separates the folded roof from the luggage. When the roof is erected the additional luggage space is available after the wall has been removed. A simple fitting for the wall has it hinged about a transverse axis. The wall either hinges down onto the floor of the luggage space or hinges about its top edge to swing up to cover the space between the normal boot lid and the rear seat. Interlocks prevent the roof from being folded while the wall is in the wrong position.

<CLAIMS>
A retractable top system for motor vehicles with a box to 
house the folding top, in the region of a boot space, the 

top box having a device for its demarcation in respect of 
the boot space, characterised in that the demarcation device 

is an intermediate wall (6) which is pivotable between a 
closed position delineating the top box (3) from the boot 

space (4) and an open position which when the top (2) is 
closed allows the top box (3) to be used as a boot space 

(4). 
A retractable top system according to Claim 1, characterised 
in that the intermediate wall (6) is disposed crosswise to 

the longitudinal axis of the motor vehicle (1) and is 
positioned substantially vertical in the closed position and 

substantially horizontal in the opened position. 
A top system according to Claim 1 or 2, characterised in 
that the intermediate wall (6) is pivotally mounted in the 

bottom part of the boot space (4). 
A top system according to Claim 1 or 2, characterised in 
that the intermediate wall (6) is pivotally mounted in the 

upper part of the boot space (4). 
A top system according to one of the preceding Claims, 
characterised in that it comprises a means of determining 

the positions of the intermediate walls (6) and/or of the 
rear seat back (5) and/or of the top (2). 
A top system according to Claim 5, characterised in that the 
means comprises at least one contact switch (8 or 9) on the 

intermediate wall (6) and/or on the rear seat back (5) 
which, when the intermediate wall (6) is opened and/or when 

the rear seat back (5) is folded down, generates a signal 
which prevents the top (2) being opened.  

 
A top system according to one of the preceding Claims, 
characterised in that it comprises an interlocking means 

with a mechanism for locking the intermediate wall (6) in 
the closed condition and/or a mechanism for locking the rear 

seat back (5) in the raised position when the top (2) is 
opened and for releasing the intermediate wall (6) and/or 

the rear seat back (5) when the top (2) is closed.
