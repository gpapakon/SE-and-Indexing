<ABSTRACT>
An acoustic production system having multiple 
signal sources (20,22) and a power amplifier (28) driving an 

acoustic transducer (32) such as a loudspeaker includes an 
arbitrator in a power limiter circuit to selectively limit 

the input level of one of the sources to the power amp (28) 
in response to an overdrive signal from the amplifier. The 

input level to the power amplifier (28) is automatically 
reduced in response to the overdrive signal until a 

predetermined level of limiting has been attained. Once the 
predetermined level of limiting is reached, the 

arbitrator (62) outputs a second overdrive signal to prompt 
additional limiting of the power amplifier output. 

Preferably, the arbitrator (62) is included in an interior 
active noise cancellation module (22) combined with an audio 

entertainment system for a passenger compartment of a motor 
vehicle. The audio system (12) also preferably separates 

the audio reproduction into high frequency and low frequency 
branches, whereby the arbitrator (62) acts upon the signals 

output in the frequency ranges of active noise cancellation 
and the bass output of the audio entertainment system that 

are most likely to overdrive an amplifier.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates generally to acoustic
production systems, and more particularly to a DSP system
arbitrating audio reproduction and active noise cancellation
for selectively limiting power amplifier output.To improve acoustic reproduction systems, digital
signal processing (DSP) systems have been used to control
processing of input signals to generate drive signals for
the acoustic production emitted by a loudspeaker.One previously known form of acoustic production system
comprises an active noise control (ANC) production system.
Such a system may be conveniently employed in the passenger
compartment of the motor vehicle to compensate for the noise
of the power train as well as road noise generated as the
vehicle travels. In such a system, a sensed signal is input
to an adaptive filter that generates an opposing phase
signal that cancels out the sensed primary noise signal.Another known production system often used in vehicles
comprises an audio entertainment reproduction system. Since
both the audio entertainment system and an interior active
noise cancellation system operate to affect the sounds
perceived by passengers in the passenger compartment, it
would readily appear desirable to consolidate both systems
using the same output transducer, for example, one or more
loudspeakers, within the passenger compartment to perform
both functions. Moreover, the structural simplicity of DSP
components and the ease of functional changeover by software
modification, renders the combination of noise cancellation
and audio reproduction a most practical combination.
Such a combined system is disclosed in the European patent application EP-A-0 461 801.Nevertheless, the use of a single power amplifier to
drive the transducers in response to both active noise
cancellation signals and audio reproduction signals may
overdrive the power amplifier and substantially disrupt the
signal being delivered to or emanating from the
loudspeakers.In order to avoid distortion in the amplified signals
and acoustic response when signal peaks of the output of the 
overdriven power amplifier are clipped, it has been known to
detect the clipping of the output signal and then limit the
input to the amplifier or the gain of the amplifier in order
to eliminate the clipping and the resultant distortion. For
example, U.S. Patent Nos. 5,001,440, 5,068,620, 4,048,573
disclose apparatus for detecting and limiting clipping of
amplifier outputs. U.S. Patent No. 4,912,424 also
recognized that wideband input signal limitation may be
unde
