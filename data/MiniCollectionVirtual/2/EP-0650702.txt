<ABSTRACT>
A method for registration of the position of a dental restoration (3) with regard to the mould surface is distinguished in that there is pictorial recording of the position of the model on the funnel former (6) before embedding. Expediently, this is carried out with simultaneous pictorial fixation of a mark (11) which represents the position of the surface of an allocated mould in relation to the cast object or to the funnel former. This may be a mark which is physically connected to the funnel former. However, it may also be contained in the recording apparatus or stored in the evaluation unit of the recording apparatus. If different sizes are used, allocation of the particular mark to the funnel former of predetermined size can take place automatically. Instead of using such a mark it is also possible in addition to make a pictorial record of the mould after embedding in order to relate the position of the object to the position of the mould surfaces by comparing the records made before and after embedding. Instead, it is also possible to register the model in the actually used muffle mould or to register the model or the mould cavity of the ready-made muffle.
