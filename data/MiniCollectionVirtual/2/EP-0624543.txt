<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a device for taking up, transporting and positioning vehicles or other objects of similar dimensions. The vehicles are to be rotated in an axis by a certain angle by means of the device in order to permit a certain working position at the vehicle. The object of the invention is to remove the disadvantages of the known working devices and create a device which enables spatial separation of working space and travel way of the device and, through free accessibility, permits the use of dismantling aids and lifting gear. This object is achieved with the device according to Claim 1.

<CLAIMS>
Apparatus for receiving, transporting and
positioning vehicles or similar objects, having a

receiving, rotating and lifting arrangement, a vertically
adjustable rotating mechanism (9) being disposed on a

travelling means (1) and being provided with drive
assemblies (4), which retain and guide at least one rigid,

circular rotary carrier (5), which is disposed in an
arcuate manner over the travelling means (1) and is open in

the chord, and the rotary carrier (5) being angularly
adjustable in a form-locking manner via a pair of toothed

wheels (3) disposed on the outer circumference of said
carrier, characterised in that at least one rotary carrier

(5), in the receiving position, has a linearly displaceable
retaining structure (7) in the upper portion of the arc

and linearly displaceable retaining structures (6) on the
ends of at least one arc.
Apparatus according to claim 1, characterised in
that the vertical adjustment of the rotating mechanism (9)

is effected by a displaceable lifting mechanism (2)
disposed laterally on the travelling means (1).
Apparatus according to claims 1 and 2,
characterised in that the rotary carrier (5) is retained in

an arcuate manner over the travelling means (1) by a
plurality of wheels, rolls, balls or rollers, which engage

in the side walls of the rotary carriers (5).
Apparatus according to claims 1 to 3, characterised
in that a collecting device (8) is disposed in the lower

side of the rotary carrier (5) when viewed with respect to
the pivotal position. 
Apparatus according to claims 1 to 4, characterised
in that the 
travelling means (1) is a rail-guided vehicle
or a linear guide.
