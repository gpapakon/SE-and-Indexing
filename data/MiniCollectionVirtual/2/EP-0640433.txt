<ABSTRACT>
A gripper carrier (9) with two pivotable grippers (10A, 10B) is rotatably mounted on the free end of a swivel arm (8) and can be swivelled via a toothed belt (13). During this swivelling movement, control rollers (a, b) run in a cam (19) of a cam plate (15) which can alternatively be coupled via a spindle (14) to the swivel arm (8) or the gripper carrier (9). By relative rotation between the cam plate (15) and the gripper carrier (9), the grippers can be reliably swivelled in a purely mechanical manner into the respectively required position for receiving and transferring tools. Remote control and corresponding feedback and monitoring of the gripper swivelling can be dispensed with in this case. Positive gripper control is possible here in the sense that tools held in the two grippers cannot collide with one another, even if the swivel axes of the grippers are offset from one another only by about 90 DEG .
