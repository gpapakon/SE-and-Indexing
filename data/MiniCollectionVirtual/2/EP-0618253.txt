<ABSTRACT>
Polyurethane foam of low thermal conductivity 
is prepared by employing carbon dioxide as a blowing agent, 

preferably in combination with a halogenated compound, 
typically a halocarbon or halohydrocarbon such as 

monofluorotrichloromethane or 1,1-dichloro-1-fluoroethane, 
and incorporating in the foam a carbon 

dioxide-reactive reagent. Sodium hydroxide and soda lime 
are illustrative carbon dioxide-reactive reagents. The 

carbon dioxide is preferably formed in situ by the reaction 
of water with the diisocyanate precursor of the 

polyurethane, and the carbon dioxide-reactive reagent is 
preferably introduced in admixture with a portion of the 

polyol precursor.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to insulating foams, and
more particularly to polyurethane foams having unusually
low thermal conductivity.Insulating polyurethane foam is an indispensable
constituent of many refrigerators and similar cooling units.
By reason of increasingly strict Federal Government energy
conservation standards, it is of interest to develop foams
having substantially lower thermal conductivity than those
presently available.Conventional insulating polyurethane foam is
generally prepared by the reaction of at least one polyol
with at least one diisocyanate in the presence of suitable
catalysts, surfactants and blowing agents. Among the
blowing agents employed are halogenated compounds, which
may be halocarbons such as monofluorotrichloromethane
and/or halohydrocarbons such as 1,1-dichloro-1-fluoroethane.
They remain in the cell voids of the foam
after blowing, and their presence therein is beneficial since
they have very low thermal conductivity and thus contribute
to the insulating quality of the foam.Also usually present in the reaction mixture is
water, which serves at least three purposes. First, in small
quantities it is effective to improve the flow properties of
the mixture. Second, it reacts with a minor proportion of
the diisocyanate to form carbon dioxide, which is also
effective as a blowing agent. Third, it reacts to form
substituted urea crosslinking moieties, thus stabilizing the
foam as it is produced.It is apparent, therefore, that the presence of
water is advantageous for many purposes. Its presence is 
also disadvantageous, however, in that the carbon dioxide
produced therefrom, which remains in the foam cell voids,
has a high thermal conductivity. Thus, a foam prepared with
the use of a blowing agent combination including 15% and
50% (by volume) carbon dioxide has a thermal conductivity
approximately 5% and 15%, respectively, higher than a
corresponding foam prepared without the use of carbon
dioxide.It would thus be of considerable interest to
devise methods for producing insulating foam which employ
carbon dioxide as a blowing agent, but which also produce a
foam free from carbon dioxide or containing only very minor
proportions thereof.US-A-4426488 discloses a method and composition
for preparing elastomeric polymers containing a
particulate rubber filler which permit the molding of a
wide variety of rubber-like goods. The composition
comprises a polyol, an organic polyisocyanate, an
alkaline carbon dioxide absorbent and a water carrier in
amounts sufficient to form a
