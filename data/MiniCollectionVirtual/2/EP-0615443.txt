painful and/or inflammatory, and also febrile, disorders, 

containing flurbiprofen in addition to customary pharmaceutical 
excipients and auxiliaries, characterized in 

that the flurbiprofen is present in the form of a pharmaceutically 
administrable nanosol which essentially 

contains gelatin, a collagen hydrolysate or a gelatin 
derivative as the excipient, the nanosol

particle size of 10 - 800 nm and possesses a surface 

charge, 
b) an outer phase of gelatin, a collagen hydrolysate or 
a gelatin derivative, which is oppositely charged, 

and 
c) an approximate or complete isoionic state of charge 
of the inner and outer phase and 
d) being physiologically absorbable. 
Medicament according to Claim 1, characterized in 
that the flurbiprofen is present as a racemate. 
Medicament according to Claim 1, characterized in 
that the flurbiprofen is present as a pseudoracemate or 

as a mixture of the racemate with its enantiomers. 
Medicament according to Claim 1, characterized in 
that the flurbiprofen is present as pure S- or R-enantiomer. 
Medicament according to Claim 1, characterized in 
that the flurbiprofen is present as a mixture of S- and 

R-enantiomers of different content. 
Medicament according to Claim 3, characterized in  
 

that the flurbiprofen is present in the form of a mixture 
of the previously separated enantiomers. 
Medicament according to one of Claims 1 to 6,

inflammatory, and also febrile, disorders, containing 
flurbiprofen in addition to customary pharmaceutical 

excipients and auxiliaries, characterized in that it is 
partly present as an immediate-effect form and partly as 

a sustained-release form containing flurbiprofen in the 
form of a pharmaceutically administrable nanosol, the 

nanosol 

a) having an inner phase of flurbiprofen which has a 
particle size of 10 - 800 nm and possesses a surface 

charge,
