<ABSTRACT>
This invention is directed to an improved 
thermoplastic molding composition having an admixture 

of thermoplastic polymer or blends thereof 
and a particular mineral additive having needle 

like particles and a high aspect ratio of length 
to diameter. The composition when molded with the 

final article has improved surface characteristics, 
even a Class A surface, a lower coefficient of 

thermal expansion, as well as other improved properties, 
particularly impact as determined by 

Dynatup testing. The mineral additive can range 
from 5 to 70 weight percent. The polymer portion 

can be a copolyetherimide ester, a copolyether 
ester, an aromatic polycarbonate, a rubber modified 

homopolymer, or copolymer of a vinyl aromatic 
monomer, a polyphenylene ether, a polyamide, and 

blends thereof or blends with other polymers. The 
preferred mineral additive is calcium meta silicate, 

also known as wollastonite.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention is directed to an improved
moldable thermoplastic composition having in admixture
a particular polymer or blends of particular
polymers and a particulate mineral additive. The
particulate mineral additive of this invention has
needle like particles of a relatively small diameter
and having a high aspect ratio of length to
diameter. A molded article employing the composition
of this invention can have a lower coefficient
of thermal expansion (CTE) and/or a high distinctness
of image (DOI), which results in a molded
article that can have a Class A surface, or an
improved surface, as well as other improved properties,
particularly impact when compared to
other mineral additives.A class A surface has been defined in many
different ways with no universal definition. One
accepted definition is a glossy, smooth and
polished surface which should be as smooth as that
of a current automobile exterior part made from
sheet metal. Another definition is that the
visible surface of the article in the finished
state is free of exposed glass fibers, flash,
sharp edges, visible parting lines, crazing,
porosity, hair line cracks, blisters, and obvious
repairs. In the present invention, another way of
determining a Class A surface is based on the distinctiveness 
of image (DOI), which is a determination
or measurement of reflective light waves.The compositions of the present invention are
useful in many applications, but particularly in
automotive exterior body panel applications such
as fascia and side cladding parts, and can even
find use in such parts as fenders, hoods, panels,
trunk lids, door panels, etc. Due to the bake oven
temperatures employed during painting of the automobile,
as low a coefficient of thermal (CTE)
expansion is wanted so as to obtain as close tolerances
as possible between molded thermoplastic
parts or between plastic and metal parts but still
retain all other valuable properties of the thermoplastic
parts being used. In other words, the
parts would have predictable finished dimensions.
In addition, the parts made with the compositions
of this invention can have a Class A surface as
measured by distinctness of image (DOI), which is
a measure of reflective light waves.U.S. Patent 5,091,461 discloses and claims an
amorphous polymer matrix and an organic filler
having improved properties of reduced coefficient
of thermal expansion, high falling dart impact
resistance and good resistance to heat under load.
The composition consists of an aromatic polycarbonate,
a rubber modified
