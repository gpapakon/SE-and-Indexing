<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a blocking device for cabriolet tops. The latter has a four-joint construction with a bearing frame (4) which is connected to the tip (2) of the roof, a handle (6), an articulated clip (7, 7') and a lever (5, 5'). A locking hook (9) which can pivot about an axis (10) is mounted on the elongate end of the lever. This locking device is modified so that a precise control of the locking hook (9) und thus a comfortable control sequence when closing the cover is made possible and, in addition, protection against accidents is improved. For this purpose, a link guide (8) and a spring (13) which exerts a torque on the hook (9) are provided for the locking hook (9).

A device for locking cabriolet tops, and comprising a four-bar structure with a
mounting frame (4) connected to the roof apex (2), a handle (6), a hinge member (7, 7')

ad a lever (5, 5') on the lengthened end of which there is a locking hook (9) adapted to
pivot about a spindle (10), characterised in that for controlling the pivoting movement of

the locking hook (9) there is on the hook (9) a spring (13) exerting torque in the direction
of closure and a connecting link guide (8) providing a guide curve (12), so that a guide

bolt (11) provided on the locking hook (9) is maintained bearing on the guide curve (12)
by the force of the spring (13).
A device according to claim 1, characterised in that the guide curve (12) of the
connecting link guide (8) and the spring (13) are so attuned to each other that when the

handle (6)is actuated in order to close the cabriolet top, there is imparted to the locking
hook (9) a movement which compels its tip to travel forwards and upwards into the end

support (16).
A device according to claim 1 or 2, characterised in that the guide curve (12) of
the connecting link guide (8) is formed substantially as a hyperbola in its portion through

which the guide bolt (11) passes.
A device according to one of claims 1 to 3, characterised in that the guide curve
(12) of the connecting link guide (8) is constructed in the front part of the mounting

frame (4).
A device according to one of claims 1 to 4, characterised in that the spring (13)
is disposed on the pivot axis (10) of the locking hook (9) and pretensions this latter in the

direction of closure.
