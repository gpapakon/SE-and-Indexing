<ABSTRACT>
Disclosed is an apparatus (10) and process for magnetizing permanently magnetizable strip and sheet material (50) to form a pattern of band-like poles on the material. Two parallel stacks (14, 16) of permanent magnets (18) are used, each magnet in each stack having a direction of magnetization which is perpendicular to a slot-like air gap (30) between the stacks. The magnets (18) in each stack are parallel to one another, with unlike poles (N.S.) of adjoining magnets proximate so that they mutually attract one another. Unlike poles of the respective magnets (18) in opposite stacks are positioned diametrically opposite each other across the air gap (30). The apparatus does not use electromagnetic coils and can form very narrow, contiguous band-like poles on magnetizable sheet or strip material (50) which is passed through the air gap (30).

<DESCRIPTION>
Conventional magnetization produces only two 
poles at opposite ends of a magnet, one north and the 
other south. For many types of permanent magnet 
materials it is most commonly carried out by use of an 
electromagnet. The electromagnet simply comprises an 
iron yoke with high permeability pole pieces and coils 
wound about either the yoke or the pole pieces between 
which the material to be magnetized is positioned. A 
direct electric current is passed through the coils to 
create a magnetizing field. The magnetizing field 
strength varies (though non-linearly) with the amplitude 
of the current, if all other factors remain the 
same. The magnetization of modern materials which 
require unusually strong magnetizing fields, such as 
samarium cobalt and the neodymium iron class of rare 
earth permanent magnets, frequently requires the use  
 
of an "impulse" type magnetizer. Impulse magnetizers 
are also widely used where complex pole patterns (such 
as band-like or "multiple" poles) are needed. A 
special power supply is an essential part of the 
impulse magnetizer; it must accomplish more than 
merely rectify AC to DC current. For band-like poles, 
special magnetizing fixtures are often used, with 
windings shaped like a potato masher of relatively 
short overall wire length. The number of turns of 
wire and wire sizes that can be employed in such 
devices are limited by the need to accommodate the 
current required to produce the needed magnetizing 
field. High currents are required for the conventional 
magnetization of older magnetic materials 
(e.g., barium ferrite) when the magnets are large 
and/or require a saturation field (HS) in excess of 
about 5000 oersteds. Extremely high currents, to 
produce fields up to about 45,000 oersteds, are 
required to saturate magnets of the rare earth type as 
well as to form complex multiple pole patterns, even 
for older materials. At present, the especially high 
currents needed to produce multiple poles in very 
narrow band-like patterns can only be developed by the 
sudden discharge of a large capacitor into the turns 
of a properly designed coil. The impulse magnetizer 
comprising the power supply and the fixture containing 
the magnetizing coil into which the current is  
 
suddenly discharged, creates a strong but transient 
field which lasts only for a period of a few milliseconds. It is frequently desirable to magnetize 
barium, strontium and/or lead ferrite strip and 
sheet-like materials so that they have multiple poles, 
that is, poles which are
