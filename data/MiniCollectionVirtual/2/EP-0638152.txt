<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention broadly concerns gaskets which are 
adapted to be interposed between joined pieces in a flow line 
that is operative to convey a flow of fluid. More 
specifically, however, the field of the present invention is 
directed to isolation gaskets which serve both as a seal 
between connected pieces in a flow line, such as between two 
pipe sections, as insulator operative to electrically isolate 
the joined pieces from one another. The present invention 
even more specifically concerns isolation gaskets used in 
critical service applications wherein operating pressures 
and/or temperatures are elevated. The oil and gas production industry provides an example 
of an industry that requires critical service gasket 
technology due to the pressures and temperatures involved as 
well as to corrosive forces inherent in the extraction of oil 
and/or gas and the transportation of the produced oil/gas to 
refineries, gas plants, etc. The continued need for improved 
technology for these pipeline systems is three-fold. First, 
the pipeline systems employed in the oil and gas industry 
represent a huge capital investment so that the protection 
against damage of the various components of the system is cost 
effective. Second, there are high labor costs associated with 
the repair and maintenance of such pipeline systems where 
damage due to corrosion or gasket blowout occurs; these costs 
result from the amount of time involved to repair the system 
as well as in the expenses often associated where such 
pipeline systems are in remote geographic locations, as is 
increasingly becoming the case in the oil and gas production 
industry. Third, and perhaps more significant, is the 
potential for environmental damage which can occur, especially 
in remote, pristine environments, should a pipeline system 
leak due to deteriorated pipeline components or connections 
therebetween. Such leakage in the presence of an electric  
 
field also creates the environmental danger of fire. Damage to and deterioration of components in a oil 
and/or gas pipeline system is a problem that has long time 
been recognized and stems from several forces, including 
oxidation, mechanical breakdown, chemical breakdown, and 
electrolysis breakdown. The latter two, chemical breakdown 
and electrolysis breakdown being the most problematic. 
Numerous substances in the production environment serve to 
stimulate the corrosion process of metal components, for 
example, carbon dioxide, hydrogen sulfide and saltwater which 
are all
