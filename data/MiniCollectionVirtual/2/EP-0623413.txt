<ABSTRACT>
Quick-clamping device for jigsaw blades, with a receptacle in the plunger (1) of the jigsaw as well as holding means which reach behind lateral projections (4a) on the jigsaw blade (4) and thereby secure the jigsaw blade (4) at the bottom to prevent it from falling out, characterized in that a rotary sleeve (5) preloaded rotatably in the peripheral direction is mounted on the plunger (1). Inner surfaces of the rotary sleeve (5) form control paths (5a) for the holding means, designed as radially movable locking elements (7), for the saw blade (4). Sitting on the plunger (1) is a sleeve-shaped ball carrier (8) which mounts the locking elements (7), designed as retaining balls, in radial passage openings and rotatably accommodates the rotary sleeve (5) to the outside. The rotary sleeve (5) is preloaded in the second angular position by a torsion spring (6) mounted between it and the ball carrier (8) in an intermediate space. The control paths (5a) in the inner wall of the rotary sleeve are formed in such a way that the angle of the control paths, with increasing positional displacement of the retaining balls to the inside, runs flatly in such a way that, supplemented by the restoring action of the torsion spring (6) acting on the rotary sleeve (5), at least self-locking or ever-increasing infeed of the retaining balls comes into effect.

A quick-action clamping device for compass-saw blades, with a receiving means in the
plunger (1) of the compass saw, and with holding means which engage behind side projections

(4a) on the compass-saw blade (4) and thereby prevent the compass-saw blade
(4) from falling downwards, wherein a rotary sleeve (5) rotatably pre-stressed in the peripheral

direction is mounted on the plunger (1), inner surfaces of the rotary sleeve (5)
forming control paths (5a) for the holding means - in the form of radially movable

arresting elements (7) - for the saw blade (4), 
characterized in that
 the plunger (1) has
mounted thereon a sleeve-shaped ball carrier (8) which supports the arresting elements

(7) in the form of locking balls in radial through openings and receives the rotary sleeve
(5) in an outwardly rotatable manner, the rotary sleeve (5) being pre-stressed into the

second angular position by a torsion spring (6) mounted between it and the ball carrier
(8) in an intermediate space.
A quick-action clamping device for compass-saw blades, with a receiving means in the
plunger (1') of the compass saw, and with holding means which engage behind side projections

(4a) on the compass-saw blade (4) and thereby prevent the compass-saw blade
(4) from falling downwards, wherein a rotary sleeve (5') rotatably pre-stressed in the

peripheral direction is mounted on the plunger (1'), inner surfaces of the rotary sleeve (5')
forming control paths (5a') for the holding means - constructed in the form of radially

movable arresting elements (7) - for the saw blade (4), 
characterized in tha
t the
receiving means for the arresting elements (7) constructed in the form of locking balls is

formed directly by the plunger (1') which on the outside supports only the rotary sleeve
(5') with its control paths (5a') and with the pre-stressing by a spring, wherein the locking

balls (7) are mounted in an opposite transverse bore in the plunger shaft.
A quick-action clamping device according to Claim 1 or 2, 
characterized in that
 in a
pre-set first angular position of the rotary sleeve (5, 5') the passage of the compass-saw

blade part to be clamped with an upper tip (4b) and side projections (4a) into the
receiving means is possible, and in a second angular position automatically occupied by

the rotary sleeve (5, 5') on account of pre-stressing by a spring after being released the
arresting elements protrude below the side projections (4a) on the compass-saw blade (4).
A quick-action clamping device according to one of Claims 1 to 3, 
characterized in that

in addition to the fastening of the side saw-blade projections by the arresting elements (7) 
upper edges of the side projections (4a) are received by centring receiving grooves (1b)

on the plunger (1, 1').
A quick-action clamping device according to one of Claims 1 to 4, 
characterized in that

a counter holding means (3) mounted axially in the plunger (1, 1') under pre-stressing by
a spring is provided.
A quick-action clamping device according to one of Claims 1 to 5, 
characterized in that

the counter holding means (3) grips and secures the upper saw-blade tip (4b) with a
centring opening (3a).
A quick-action clamping device according to one of Claims 1 to 6, 
characterized in that

the diameter of the locking balls (7) on the one hand and the height of the side projections
(4a) on the compass-saw blade (4) on the other hand as well as the distance of the

receiving grooves (1b) converging upwards in a tapered manner on the plunger (1,1') are
dimensioned in such a way that the respective compass-saw blade is held in its seat with

positive locking and without play in the locked position with an upwardly directed pressing
force which acts constantly by way of the locking balls and which pre-stresses the

side projections (4a) of the compass-saw blade in the receiving grooves (1b) against the
pressure of the counter holding means (3).
A quick-action clamping device according to one of Claims 1 to 7, 
characterized in that

the control paths (5a, 5a') in the inner wall of the rotary sleeve are constructed in such a
way that the control-path angle extends flat with a position displacement - orientated

inwards to an increasing extent - of the locking balls in such a way that, increased by the
restoring action of the torsion spring (6) acting upon the rotary sleeve (5, 5'), at least selflocking

or increasingly powerful locking of the locking balls comes into effect.
A quick-action clamping device according to Claim 2, 
characterized in that
 the transverse
bores (17a, 17b) for receiving the locking balls (7) in the plunger shaft (1') extend

inwards from the outside at an oblique upward inclination.
