<ABSTRACT>
In order to take an image of the mouth region (2) of a bottle (1), a luminous surface (3) is arranged under the mouth region to be imaged. The luminous surface (3) is illuminated by means of an illumination device (4) and the image of the illuminated mouth region (2) is sent to a camera by a mirror arrangement (5,6,11). Using the luminous surface it is possible to image the mouth region using transmitted light, which provides improved detectability of defects and contaminations in the mouth region, and thereby easier evaluation of the image taken by the camera.
