<ABSTRACT>
In an underground borer with down hammer 
having a vehicle body 1. a guide stilt 2 standing on the 

vehicle body, and a rotary machine 4 having its bottom 
coupled with a screw shaft 3 and a down hammer B. a 

supply unit 5 is interposed between the rotary machine 4 
and the screw shaft 3, a fluid conduit 6 is formed 

centrally of the screw shaft 3, compressed air conduits 
7 and 7' are formed to surround the fluid conduit 6. 

and a fluid jetting pipe 8 is arranged centrally of the 
down hammer B to extend until the inside of a bit body 9 

so that water may be discharged, along with high-pressure 
compressed air, from a central portion of the 

bottom surface of the bit body during boring to cool the 
bit body, promote anti-wear properties, suppress powdery 

dirts, reduce noises and increase the boring speed.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an underground 
borer with a down hammer and more particularly 
to an underground borer in which a fluid jetting pipe is 
arranged centrally of a down hammer of the borer so that 
fluid may be discharged. along with compressed air, from 
the bottom portion of a bit body to the outside of the 
borer. A conventional underground borer with 
down hammer or a method of construction using 
the same is disclosed in Japanese Patent Application 
Laid-open No. Sho 55-119885 wherein a hammer excavating 
head is coupled to a ram of an oil pressure cylinder 
suspended so as to be free to ascend and descend. a 
circuit for feeding pressurized oil is connected to the 
oil pressure cylinder and that circuit is connected 
with a high pressure relief valve and with a low 
pressure relief valve through a switching valve. whereby 
by determining setting pressures of the two relief 
valves to proper values, ground pressure received by a  
 
spiking bit can be adjusted to a value which allows the 
spiking bit to move vertically. A technique is disclosed 
in Japanese Utility Model Application Laid-open No. Sho 
55-113786 wherein an air hammer having a spiking bit 
attached to the fore end of a screw auger is mounted on 
its outer periphery with a spiral screw blade whose 
diameter is increased upwardly gradually and the screw 
blade is mounted with an excavating cutting edge, 
whereby even with a small-diametered or size-reduced air 
hammer, a hole of a large diameter can be excavated. A 
method of construction for boring has also been known as 
disclosed in Japanese Patent Application Laid-open No. 
Sho 55-23272. according to which in a borer wherein a 
piston operated by compressed air is attached to the 
bottom of a drill pipe and a bit is mounted to the 
piston so as to be moved vertically, a nozzle having a 
check valve directed laterally is disposed in the lower 
end of the drill pipe so that as excavation effected by 
the borer proceeds. mortar or the like is blown from the 
nozzle against a bored hole wall so as to be forcibly 
deposited thereon. In the conventionally known underground borers 
the bit body inside the down hammer is reciprocated 
under the application of compressed air to bore a rock 
by the hammer action but heat is generated by friction  
 
between the bit body and the rock to raise the 
temperature of the bit body and as a result anti-wear 
properties of the bit body is degraded within a 
relatively short period of time. In addition. since 
powdery dirts are

<CLAIMS>
An underground borer having a vehicle body, a 
guide stilt standing on said vehicle body, and a rotary 

machine having its bottom coupled with a screw shaft and 
a down hammer, wherein a supply unit is interposed 

between said rotary machine and said screw shaft, a 
fluid conduit is formed centrally of said screw shaft, 

compressed air conduits are formed to surround said 
fluid conduit, and a fluid jetting pipe in commuincation 

with said fluid conduit is arranged centrally of said 
down hammer, whereby fluid is discharged, along with 

compressed air, from a central portion of the bottom 
surface of a bit body to the outside of said borer. 
An underground borer according to claim 1 
wherein in said supply unit, flanges are coupled to 

upper and lower portions of a rotary member so as to 
permit said rotary member to be connected between said 

rotary machine and said screw shaft, an annular member 
is applied around the outer periphery of said rotary 

member, bearings are attached to upper and lower 
portions of said annular member, caps are fixed by means 

of screw bolts, and a semicircular annular groove formed 
in a middle part of contact surface of said rotary 

member faces a semicircular annular groove formed in a 
middle part of contact surface of said annular member, 

 
said one annular groove being in communication with a 

compressed air supply source and the other annular 
groove being in communication with said compressed air 

conduits formed in said screw shaft.
