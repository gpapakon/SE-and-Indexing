<ABSTRACT>
An abrasive tool insert (10) comprises a cemented substrate (11) 
and a polycrystalline diamond layer (12) formed thereon by high 

pressure, high temperature processing. The interface between 
the substrate and the diamond layer comprises at least one 

angled profile (14) wherein said profile slopes downwardly and 
outwardly toward the periphery of the insert.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to the field of
abrasive tool inserts and, more particularly, to such
inserts having at least one angled contour at the
diamond/substrate interface to provide improved
durability and reduced susceptibility to spalling,
cracking and wear of the diamond layer.Abrasive compacts are used extensively in cutting,
milling, drilling and other abrasive
operations. The abrasive compacts typically consist of
polycrystalline-diamond or cubic boron nitride particles
bonded into a coherent hard conglomerate. The abrasive
particle content of abrasive compacts is high and there
is an extensive amount of direct particle-to-particle
bonding. Abrasive compacts are made under elevated
temperature and pressure conditions at which the abrasive
particle, be it diamond or cubic boron nitride, is
crystallographically stable.Abrasive compacts tend to be brittle and, in use,
they are frequently supported by being bonded to a
cemented carbide substrate. Such supported abrasive
compacts are known in the art as composite abrasive
compacts. The composite abrasive compact may be used as 
such in the working surface of an abrasive tool.
Alternatively, particularly in drilling and mining
operations, it has been found advantageous to bond the
composite abrasive compact to an elongated cemented
carbide pin to produce what is known as a stud cutter.
The stud cutter is then mounted in the working surface of
a drill bit or a mining pick.Fabrication of the composite is typically achieved
by placing a cemented carbide substrate into the
container of a press. A mixture of diamond grains or
diamond grains and catalyst binder is placed atop the
substrate and compressed under high pressure, high
temperature (HPHT) conditions. In so doing, metal binder
migrates from the substrate and "sweeps" through the
diamond grains to promote a sintering of the diamond
grains. As a result, the diamond grains become bonded to
each other to form a diamond layer, and that diamond
layer is bonded to the substrate along a conventionally
planar interface. Metal binder remains disposed in the
diamond layer within pores defined between the diamond
grains.A composite formed in the above-described manner may
be subject to a number of shortcomings. For example, the
coefficients of thermal expansion and elastic constants
of cemented carbide and diamond are close but not exactly
the same. Thus, during heating or cooling of the
polycrystalline diamond compact (PDC), thermally induced 
stresses occur at the interface between the diamond layer
and
