<ABSTRACT>
The mixture of natural microorganisms proposed has a biodegradation action on petroleum and petroleum products. It contains Pseudomonas putida and Geotrichum candidum in the ratio 5:1 to 1:1 by number of cells. The mixture is induced by cultivation in the presence of oleic acid. The mixutre is then allowed to act on hydrocarbons in a supply of oxygen in the presence of stimulators at a pH of 4.5 to 7.5 and a temperature of 5  DEG C to 35  DEG C.
