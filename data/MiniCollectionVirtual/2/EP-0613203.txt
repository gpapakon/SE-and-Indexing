<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a device for 
indicating the residual capacity of nickel-cadmium 
cells and to a method of indicating the residual 
capacity of nickel-cadmium cells. Secondary cells such as nickel-cadmium cells and 
nickel-hydrogen cells are recharged many times 
throughout their service life. The recharging 
operation must be carefully controlled in order to 
minimize the harmful effects that have been known 
among people skilled in the art (see, for example, 
"Charging Storage Cells: Life-Extending Ability", Bob 
Williams, Cellular Business, April, 1989, pp. 44-49). 
In the early stage of the secondary cell recharging 
technology, the recharging operation consumed a time 
as long as several hours. As consumer devices powered 
by the secondary cells became more widely used, 
however, it was necessary to develop a system that was 
capable of recharging the secondary cells not in hours 
but in minutes. Though it is possible to "quick 
charge" the secondary cells, more careful monitoring 
and control are necessary for the cell recharging 
process in order to prevent irreversible damage to the 
cells (see, for example, "Latest Information on 
Nickel-Cadmium Cells", September, 1990 Report in 
Brussels Seminar, Cadmium Association, November, 
1990, London, U.K.). There have heretofore been developed a variety of 
secondary cell recharging systems for quickly 
recharging secondary cells. These systems generally 
employ an electric circuit that monitors the voltage 
and/or the temperature of the cell that is being  
 
recharged and interrupts the supply of a charging 
current and/or changes the charging current to the 
cell when the temperature or the voltage thereof has 
reached a predetermined level. A representative prior 
art has been disclosed in U.S. Patent No. 4,006,397 
assigned to Catotti et al. Furthermore, Japanese Patent Publications 
Nos. 23528/1987 and 23529/1987 disclose methods of 
recharging secondary cells such as nickel-cadmium 
cells wherein, during the recharging operation, 
attention is given to a change in the voltage waveform 
of the cells, a plurality of inflection points 
appearing in the voltage waveform are stored in 
advance, and the charging operation is interrupted 
when the plurality of the stored inflection points 
have occurred in a predetermined order. According to 
the above methods, however, changes in the voltage 
waveform during the charging operation must be 
recorded in advance for each of various kinds of the 
cells, and the stored content must be
