<ABSTRACT>
A photoelectric switch, comprising:
 

a heating unit (24) formed around a beam transmission 
part (23) of a light transmitting plate (22) provided on a body (21) 

having a light receiving part;
 

a received light quantity decision circuit (27) for 
generating an electrical signal corresponding to a 

quantity of light received on said light receiving 
part (28), comparing the electrical signal with a set lev­

el to decide whether or not it is on the set level 
or below;

 
a temperature circuit (25) for generating an electri­

cal signal corresponding to a change in ambient tem­
perature of said body (21);

 
a driving circuit for actuating said heating 

unit (24) to heat on condition that the electrical signal 
of the temperature circuit (25) has reached a level of set 

temperature or below, and that said quantity of re­
ceived light has come to the set level or below.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a photoelectric switch 
with a dewing preventive applied to a front light 
transmitting plate provided on a body. A photoelectric switch is utilized as a vision 
sensor in FA field and others, operating for detect­
ing presence and position of an object. The photo­
electric switch is a superior sensor for its long 
detection distance and other characteristics as com­
pared with other contactless switch (electromagnetic 
induction type/electrostatic capacity type contact­
less switch), however, a problem is yet inherent in 
endurance to environment. In particular, an errone­
ous operation due to water splash to prevent a light 
transmission, dewing, freezing and the like will be 
problematical. To solve such problem, there is a photoelectric 
switch provided with a heating hood 12 for dewing 
prevention on a body 11 as shown in Fig. 5 and Fig. 
6. Here, Fig. 5 exemplifies a recurrent reflection 
type photoelectric switch, wherein a light emitting 
part and a light receiving part are incorporated 
within the body 11. That is, a light such as infra­
red ray or the like is projected toward a reflecting 
plate 13 from the light emitting part in the body 11,  
 
and a reflected light from the reflecting plate 13 
is received on the light receiving part provided in 
the body 11 likewise. Then, when the projected light 
or reflected light is intercepted by an object 14 to 
be detected, the interception is taken as a change 
in the quantity of received light at the light re­
ceiving part, and thus a presence of the object 14 
at a predetermined position is detected. The heating hood 12 has a contour part 15 fitted 
in an outer periphery of the front of the body 11, 
and a light transmitting plate 16 provided within the 
contour part 15 and covering the front of the body 
11 when installed on the body 11. A heating unit 17 
by carbon resistance, heating wire or the like is 
provided on a peripheral edge portion of the back of 
the light transmitting plate 16, which is actuated 
to heat by carrying a current thereto from a power 
source 18 through a lead wire 19, thereby preventing 
the light transmitting plate 16 from dewing. In the above construction, the heating hood 12 
for dewing prevention is mounted on the front of the 
body 11 when using the photoelectric switch under 
the environment where dew, splashed water or the like 
sticks, and a current is carried to the heating unit 
17 independently of an operation of the body 11, or  
 
light projection and reception, and thus
