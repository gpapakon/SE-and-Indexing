<ABSTRACT>
A binding device for binding and depositing piles (2) of documents in files with a binding mechanism is provided with a base strap (5) to be arranged below the pile (2) of documents, with a covering strap (6) to be arranged on the pile (2) of documents, with at least one flexible binding tongue strip (7) attached to the base strap (5), and with a covering profile rail (8) which can be pushed onto the covering strap (6) enclosing the ends (13', 14') of the two binding tongues (13, 14). The base strap (5), the covering strap (6) and the covering profile rail (8) each have further perforations (10, 16, 33) which are flush with one another in pairs for the passage of the binding mechanism of a file.

Binding device for binding and filing piles of documents (2) in folders 
having a binding mechanism, comprising 


a base flap (5) to be disposed under the pile of documents (2), 
a cover flap (6) to be disposed on the pile of documents (2), 
at least one flexible binding-tongue strip (7), which is fixed to the base 
flap (5) and forms two binding tongues (13, 14) for binding the pile of 

documents (2) by the binding tongues (13, 14) reaching through a pair of 
punched holes of the pile of documents (2) and of the cover flap (6) and 

by the ends of the binding tongues (13', 14') that project over the pile of 
documents (2) being folded down on the cover flap (6), and 
a profiled covering bar (8) to be slipped on the cover flap (6), enclosing 
the ends of the binding tongues (13', 14'), 
characterized in that
 
the base flap (5), the cover flap (6) and the profiled covering bar (8) each 

having pairs of punched holes (10, 16, 33), in alignment with each other, to 
reach through the binding mechanism of a folder, the profiled covering bar 

(8) having a clamp-type cross-sectional shape with a covering part (22) at 
the top in the position of use and with gripping ribs (24) which are bent 

inwards, adjoining the covering part (22) on both lengthwise sides (23), and 
which, in the position of use, enclose the longitudinal edges (38) of the 

cover flap (6) and, together with the covering part (22), form an insertion 
passage (25) for the cover flap (6) and the ends of the binding tongues (13', 

14'). 
Binding device according to claim 1, 
characterized in that
 the pair of 
punched holes (18) of the cover flap (6) for the binding tongues (13, 14) to  

 
reach through is situated within, and in line with, the pair of punched holes 

(16) of the cover flap (6) for the binding mechanism to reach through. 
Binding device according to claim 1 or 2, 
characterized in that
 approximately 
centrally between its punched holes (16,
 18), the cover flap (6) has 
a guide rib (20) for the folded ends of the binding tongues (13', 14'), the 

guide rib (20) projecting upwards and running at an angle to the line connecting 
the punched holes (16, 18). 
Binding device according to one of claims 1 to 3, 
characterized in that
 
the upper edge (21) of the guide rib (20) is convex. 
Binding device according to one of claims 1 to 4, 
characterized in that
 an 
insertion stop (30) projecting into the insertion passage (25) is disposed at a 

transverse end (29) of the profiled covering bar (8). 
Binding device according to one of claims 1 to 5, 
characterized in that
 a 
handling strip (31) projecting at right angles to the bar (8) is disposed on at 

least one lengthwise side (23) of the profiled covering bar (8). 
Binding device according to one of claims 1 to 6, 
characterized in that
 at 
least in the vicinity of one transverse end (29), the profiled covering bar (8) 

is provided with a fluting (32) on its upper side.
