<ABSTRACT>
Single channel remote control and regulation device, in particular for electrical motor systems, lighting systems and the like, comprising a transmitter and a receiver. The transmitter includes means for varying current strengths which produce a signal which is coded in a one-to-one way by a coder, the latter producing a signal which is transmitted by radio frequency transmission means to a receiver. The receiver has means for receiving and for decoding the radio frequency signal, and drives reversible means of linking between a mains power supply and an electrical load. The transmitter and the receiver are powered independently.
