<ABSTRACT>
Fork for spit (200) of a grill unit, the fork comprising two parallel prongs (111,112) connected by a crosspiece (120) containing a hole (121) with which to guide said spit. According to the invention, said fork also has a guide lug (130) containing a second hole (131) with which to guide the spit (200), this lug being attached to one side (122) of the crosspiece (120), and an elastic locking/releasing lug (140) containing a hole (141) with which to lock/release the spit (200), this lug being attached to the second side (123) of the crosspiece, opposite the first side (122), and tending to exert a locking force on the spit which immobilises said spit (200) against the edges (124,134) of the guide holes (121,131), the locking force being removed, in order to release the spit, by an opposite action exerted on the locking/releasing lug (140). For the electrical and household goods industry.
