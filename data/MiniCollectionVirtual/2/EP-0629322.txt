<ABSTRACT>
A radio receiver is described which detects the presence of adjacent channel interference in either the lower adjacent channel or the upper adjacent channel and shifts the received signals to remove the adjacent channel interference from the intermediate frequency passband, but only if the other adjacent channel is clear. A maximum amount of the desired signal is retained so that modulation distortion is low. Frequency limits for shifting of the desired signals prevent undesirable amounts of phase distortion from being introduced into the audio signal.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates in general to 
detecting and reducing adjacent channel interference in a 
radio receiver, and more specifically to determining the 
presence of an upper adjacent channel or a lower adjacent 
channel and shifting the frequency of a mixing signal to 
reduce adjacent channel interference. It is well known that the commercial AM and FM 
broadcast bands include a plurality of evenly spaced 
channels. A particular broadcast station is allocated a 
channel for broadcast within an assigned frequency range. The power spectrum of a transmission depends on the 
energy content of a radiated signal at each frequency. Even 
though most energy in a transmission can be limited to its 
assigned channel, efficient use of all the channels implies 
that some radiated energy will be at frequencies outside the 
assigned channel. Assignment of broadcast channels to transmitters is 
determined according to geographic location and other 
factors to minimise interference between transmissions in 
adjacent channels. However, demand in populous areas is 
high for the limited number of channels. A radio receiver 
must therefore cope with the situation where a strong signal 
on an adjacent channel creates signal components in the 
desired channel which interfere with reception of the 
desired signal. Interference has been found to be 
objectionable when the total power in the adjacent channel 
signal is about 30dB greater than the total power in the 
desired channel signal.  
 Some prior art radio receivers have detected the 
presence of an objectionable adjacent channel signal by 
various methods including: separately tuning each channel 
and measuring its signal strength; detecting beat components 
caused by an adjacent channel in the desired channel; or 
detecting the difference in signal levels of a narrow band 
portion of the desired signal and the full wide band signal 
in the desired channel. If no adjacent channel signals are 
found in the prior art receivers, then a wide band 
intermediate frequency (IF) filter is used to give the 
maximum signal quality to the desired signal. If an 
adjacent channel signal is found, then a narrow band IF 
filter is switched into the signal path to eliminate 
adjacent channel interference at the expense of introducing 
modulation distortion which reduces the desired signal 
quality. The prior art also teaches a receiver wherein 
narrow band and wide band IF signals are blended together in 
accordance with the relative strength of the adjacent 
channel signals
