<ABSTRACT>
This invention provides a method for examining the geometry of the disposition of a plurality of sources (18-24) and receivers (10-16) over an area to be surveyed with a view to optimizing the array to avoid data shadow zones and to optimize the resulting seismic image. The method depends upon studying the statistical distribution of dip polarity in dip bins along selected CMP azimuths.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates generally to seismic data processing and more particularly
to a method for optimizing the spatial geometry of a seismic data-acquisition array to
insure adequate data sampling and to avoid singularities,.In the art of seismic exploration, an acoustic wavefield (a shot) is generated by
an acoustic source. The wavefield propagates through the earth from a source location.
The wavefield is reflected from earth layers beneath the surface whence it returns to
the surface. A plurality of seismic detectors are distributed on or near the surface of
the earth, remotely from the source location, along lines of survey or in large areal
patches. Preferably, the detectors, which constitute discrete wavefield sampling
stations, are uniformly distributed spatially so that the wavefield can be uniformly
sampled both areally and temporally. The sampled data are quantized and archivally
recorded for further processing.With respect to seismic exploration in general, the ideal uniform distribution is
sometimes not possible because of obstructions such as buildings, roads or other
culture. In the case of marine exploration, the distribution is irregular because of errors
in the assumed detector locations due to cable drift because of currents and wind or due
to the presence of drilling and production platforms. The seismic data are often not
only locally under-sampled, they also may be locally excessively densely sampled.Well-known seismic data-processing algorithms such as stacking, multi-channel
filtering, dip moveout correction (DMO), prestack migration, velocity analyses,
anisotropy studies, migration and wavefield extrapolation, all assume that the data are
uniformly sampled. However, in operation, as has been explained, the data gathered
may be irregularly sampled whether because of obstructions or to missing shots or to
inoperative detectors or receivers. When such irregular or inadequately spatially
sampled data are not corrected, unwanted computational artifacts may result that are
superimposed upon the processed output data. Optimum computational results often can 
be obtained with proper design of the array geometry, that is, by optimizing the
distribution of the seismic sources and receivers to minimize or eliminate singularities
in the data.U.S. Patent No. 5,206,837, issued April 27, 1993 to C. Beasley et al. and
assigned to the assignee of this disclosure, addresses a method for compensating for
the effects of irregular spatial sampling of seismic wavefields.
One of the purposes of that

<CLAIMS>
A method for multichannel wavefield gathering, the method comprising:

(a) selecting an initial geometry for the disposition of a plurality of
acoustic sources and sampling stations;
(b) propagating an assumed wavefield from a source location;
(c) spatially sampling said assumed wavefield at a preselected
plurality of discrete sampling stations distributed along a preselected azimuth to provide

a raw input data gather;
(d) applying a DMO equalization operator to said raw input data
gather;
(e) analyzing the DMO-equalized data input gather for undesired
singularities; and
(f) perturbing the initial array geometry in the presence of an
undesired singularity.
The method as defined by claim 1, comprising:

optimizing the array configuration by iteratively executing steps (a)
through (f).
The method as defined by claim 2, wherein the step of analyzing
includes the sub steps of:


(1) sampling the dips for every x along said preselected CMP
azimuth over the range between h and -h, where h is one-half the source receiver

offset, and binning the sampled dips to form dip weight distribution tables;
(2) forming selected statistics in skew and standard deviation from
the dip weight distributions; and 
(3) defining an undesired singularity as a preferential skew towards
dips of a single polarity.
The method as defined by claim 2, comprising:

(1) forming dip weight tables;
(2) executing statistical analyses of said dip weight tables; and
(3) defining undesired singularities by analyses of said statistics.
The method as defined by claims 3 or 4, comprising:

optimizing said initial geometry by iteratively repeating steps (c) through
(e)(3) and (f).
The method as defined by claim 5, comprising:

executing steps (a) through (e)(3) and (f) during the conduct of active
survey operations in the presence of changing environmental field conditions.
