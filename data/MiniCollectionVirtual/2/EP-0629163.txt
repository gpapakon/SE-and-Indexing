Method of operating a motor vehicle brake 
containing a braking value pick-up (1) which, during 

actuation, generates a signal U which depends on the 
actuation path s and relays it to a brake pressure 

control unit (2), which in turn actuates an actuator 
(8) and feeds a pressure dependent on the signal U to 

the wheel brake (9) (friction brake), and containing an 
actuable wear-free sustained-action brake (10), 

characterized in that the brake pressure control unit 
(2) actuates the friction brake with a delay (s01) and 

with a relatively small slope as a function of the 
actuation path s but actuates the sustained-action 

brake (11) relatively rapidly and with a large slope as 
a function of the actuation path, in that a 

determination is made in the brake pressure control 
unit of how large the rise (ΔU/ΔT) of the signal U is 

with respect to time, and in that when a limiting value 
(G) is exceeded by the rise of the signal U with 

respect to time, the control unit (2) makes a type of 
operation effective in which the friction brake is 

actuated rapidly (s02) and with a relatively large 
slope as a function of the actuation path s. 
Method according to Claim 1, characterized in 
that the sustained-action brake (11) is also a
ctuated 
when the limiting value G is exceeded. 
Method according to Claim 1, characterized in 
that the sustained-action brake (11) is made 

ineffective when the limiting value is exceeded. 
Method according to Claim 1, characterized in 
that the characteristic values of U
R
 (S₀₁ and slope)  
 

are continuously displaced to more rapid braking as a 
function of ΔU/ΔT when the limiting value is exceeded. 
Method according to Claim 1 or Claim 4, 
characterized in that the beginning of braking (S₀₁) is 

displaced. 
Method according to Claim 1 or Claim 4, 
characterized in that the slope of U
R
 is changed.
