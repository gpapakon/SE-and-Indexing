<ABSTRACT>
A dispenser (10) for liquid and pulverulent materials provides a cabinet (30) with a pressurized chamber for electrical control equipment. Materials to be dispensed are controlled by a pilot valve (110) and a dispense valve (22), for each different material to be dispensed. A dispense head (174) is cantilevered from the cabinet, so as to overhang a container receiving the dispensed material.

<DESCRIPTION>
 DISPENSING APPARATUSBACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION1. Field of the InventionThe present invention pertains to apparatus for dispensing liquid and pulverulent materials.2. Description of the Related ArtThe assignee of the present invention has provided a number of commercially successful automatic dispensing machines. These machines have found ready acceptance in the paint and coatings art. Examples of these machines are shown in U.S. States Letters Patent Nos. 4,813,785; 4,967,938; 5,078,302; and 3,851,798.The machines referred to above are especially adapted for dispensing materials into containers which can be carried by hand, or which can also be delivered by conveyors to points remote from the dispensing station. For very high volume production runs, or when unusually large containers are to be filled, an unusually large source of material to be dispensed must be kept on hand at the dispensing station, and must be readily replenished, if necessary, during a work shift to keep the dispensing station fully operational with a maximum utilization. One example of such a situation is found in paint production facilities or where basic ingredients of a paint formulation are manufactured or otherwise produced. It has been found advantageous to provide what may be called "continuous" material supply, theoretically a supply of infinite size compared to the amount of material required during prolonged production runs. A typical situation may be visualized as a "tank farm" of containers coupled together through manifold arrangements to produce a source for a pipeline which runs through the production plant, with the pipeline being coupled to a dispensing apparatus. Special 

arrangements must be made to accommodate these so-called "infinite sources" of material and improvements in dispensing machinery for such installations have been sought.SUMMARY OF THE INVENTIONIt is an object of the present invention to provide dispensing apparatus for large sources of materials to be dispensed.Another object according to principles of the present invention is to provide dispensing apparatus with externally-located material storage facilities which are coupled to dispensing apparatus on board the machine.A further object according to principles of the present invention is to provide improved high volume dispensing apparatus which provides and which reduces the risks associated with dispensing materials which may be explosive or which may lead to explosive conditions under certain circumstances. These and another objects

<CLAIMS>
WHAT IS CLAIMED IS:
1. Apparatus for dispensing material into a container, comprising: , a housing defining an interior volume; a dispense head in said housing for directing a flow of material therethrough in response to control commands; a plurality of pilot valves; pneumatic coupling means for coupling a pneumatic pressure source to said pilot valves; electrical control means coupled to the pilot valves so as to operate the pilot valves in response to user-determined control commands; a plurality of dispensing valves, each having inputs for receiving a flow of material, and a metering output for delivering a controlled amount of material to said dispense head and each dispensing valve having a pneumatic command input; inter-valve conduit means coupling said pilot valves to the pneumatic command inputs of respective ones of said dispensing valves; inlet conduit means coupling the inputs of said dispensing valves to an external supply source of material; and metering output conduit means coupling the metering outputs of said dispensing valves to said dispense head.
2. The apparatus of claim 1 wherein pressure within said dispensing valves is relieved through the inter-valve conduit means.
3. The apparatus of claim 1 wherein pressure within said dispensing valves is relieved directly to the housing interior. 


 4. The apparatus of claim 1 wherein the dispensing valves further include outputs for directing a flow of material through the dispensing valves, and the apparatus further comprises outlet conduit means coupling the outputs of said dispensing valves to to an external supply source of material.
5. The apparatus of claim 1 wherein the housing further defines a pressurized compartment for enclosing the electrical control means.
6. The apparatus of claim 1 wherein the pilot valves are located between the pressurized compartment and the dispensing valves so as to remove the electrical control means from the immediate vicinity of the dispensing valves.
7. The apparatus of claim 1 wherein the apparatus further includes a hood cantilevered from said housing, with said dispense head and dispensing valves located within said hood so as to overhang a container being filled.
8. Apparatus for dispensing material into a container, comprising: a first housing defining an interior volume; a dispense head in said housing for directing a flow of material therethrough in response to control commands; a plurality of dispensing valves, each having inputs for receiving a flow of material, and a metering output for delivering a controlled amount of material to said dispense head; connection means for connecting the first housing to an external supply source of pressurized gas; pressure venting means for releasing pressure within the first housing; 


 user settable pressure monitoring means coupled to the connection means and to the pressure venting means for monitoring and maintaining pressure in the first housing at a preselected level.
9. The apparatus of claim 8 further comprising: a second housing; hollow conduit means coupling the first and second housings so as to pressurize the second housing; and the hollow conduit means supporting the second housing with a cantilever support from the first housing.
10. The apparatus of claim 9 wherein the second housing includes a second pressure venting means mounted to the second housing, for releasing pressure within the second housing.
11. The apparatus of claim 8 wherein the dispensing valves further include outputs for directing a flow of material through the dispensing valves, and the apparatus further comprises outlet conduit means coupling the outputs of said dispensing valves to to an external supply source of material.
12. The apparatus of claim 8 wherein the housing further defines a pressurized compartment for enclosing the electrical control means.
13. The apparatus of claim 8 wherein the user settable pressure monitoring means is also coupled to the second pressure venting means so as to maintain pressure in the second housing at a preselected level.
