<ABSTRACT>
A rotation detecting mechanism for a tape recorder includes a 
movable shut-off lever (74) for setting at least a reproducing lever 

(24) or a head base (80) at a stop state position, with the reproducing 
lever (24) or the head base (80) being previously set to a reproducing 

state position, a movable changeover lever (46) for interchangeably 
setting forward or reverse transporting directions of magnetic tape 

(3), and a switching device (53, 54) for selectively shifting and 
setting the shut-off lever (74) or the changeover lever (46). A 

movable trigger lever (56) is provided for selectively triggering the 
switching device (53, 54), and a rotation detection lever 65 is 

rotationally biased in a direction which is in accordance with the 
rotation and the rotational direction of a reel block (6, 7) of the 

tape recorder. A cam gear (30) rotatable perpetually in one direction 
includes a first cam surface (71a) guiding one end (68a) of the 

detecting lever (65) when the detecting lever is rotationally biased in 
one direction, a second cam surface (71b) guiding the one end (68a) of 

the detecting lever (65) when the detecting lever is rotationally 
biased in the other direction, a detecting pawl (72) protrudingly 

formed between and independently of the first and second cam surfaces 
(71a, 71b), and a centre ring section (71c) responsive to cessation of 

rotation of the reel block (6, 7) to guide the one end (68a) of the 
detecting lever (65) released from rotational biasing towards a 

rotational trajectory of the detecting pawl (72). The detecting pawl 
(72) thrusts the one end (68a) of the detecting lever (65) so that the 

other end (70) of the detecting lever (65) actuates the trigger lever 
(56).

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to rotation detecting mechanisms for tape 
recording and/or reproducing apparatus, and in particular to such 
mechanisms suitable for use in so-called auto reverse mechanisms for 
automatically reversing the running direction of a magnetic recording 
tape when the end of the tape is reached in the recording or 
reproducing mode, or in so-called auto shut-off mechanisms for 
automatically setting the apparatus to a stop mode when the end of the 
tape is reached. There has been proposed apparatus (hereinafter referred to as a 
tape recorder) for recording and/or reproducing information signals on 
a recording tape, such as a magnetic recording tape, wherein the tape 
recorder is provided with an auto-reverse function for reversing the 
tape feed direction or with an auto shut-off function for establishing 
a stop mode when the end of the tape is reached in the recording or 
reproducing mode. This type of tape recorder is provided with rotation sensing or 
detecting means whereby cessation of rotation of rotatable members such 
as reel blocks, gears or pulleys which rotate with the transporting of 
the recording tape may be sensed. One known type of rotation sensing or detecting means is an 
optical sensing means for sensing rotation of a rotatable member in 
which the rotatable member is provided with portions of different light 
reflectivity or slits, light is irradiated on these portions or slits, 
and changes in the intensity of the light reflected from or transmitted 
through the rotatable member are detected, thereby sensing the rotation 
or cessation of rotation of the rotatable member. Also known are 
magnetic or electrical sensing means for sensing the rotation of a 
rotatable member. In order to sense the rotation of a rotatable member by optical 
means in a tape recorder, it is necessary to use light emitting and 
light receiving elements as well as the electrical circuitry for 
driving the sensing elements, thus complicating the construction of the 
tape recorder. EP-A-0 215 627 discloses a tape recording apparatus employing a  
 
mechanical rotation detecting means. According to the present invention there is provided a rotation 
detecting mechanism for tape recording and/or reproducing apparatus, 
the mechanism comprising: 
   a movable shut-off lever for setting at least a reproducing lever 
or a head base at a stop state position, said reproducing lever or the 
head base having been previously set to a reproducing state position; 
   a movable changeover lever for
