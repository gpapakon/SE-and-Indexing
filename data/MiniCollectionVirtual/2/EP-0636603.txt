<ABSTRACT>
A process for producing aminocarnitine is described, wherein 
methanesulfonylcarnitine is converted to a lactone which is reacted with 

an azide to give azidocarnitine. The catalytic hydrogenation of 

azidocarnitine gives aminocarnitine.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a process for producing R- and S-aminocarnitine. Recently, the discovery of pharmacological properties of 
aminocarnitine (I, R=H) and certain acyl derivatives of aminocarnitine (I, 
R=acetyl, N-caproyl, palmitoyl) has aroused substantial interest. 
   For example, D. L. Jenkins and O.W. Griffith have described 
antiketogenic and hypoglycemic effects of compounds (I) in their 
racemic form. Also, US-A-4,521,432 (Takeda) describes the 
antiketogenic activity (with the accompanying possibility of applications 
in the treatment of diabetes) of an optically active derivative, (-)-N-acetyl 
aminocarnitine, inner salt ([α]D²⁵ = -17.4°, c = 1, H₂O). Analogous activity 
has been described for (+)-aminocarnitine chloride hydrochloride ([α]D²⁵ 
= +6.3°, c = 1, 1N AcOH)  
 
   Therefore, we feel that it is necessary to have available a process 
that provides both enantiomeric forms of aminocarnitine. Actually, R(+)-aminocarnitine chloride can be obtained by acid 
hydrolysis of R(-)-N-acetyl aminocarnitine, isolated as a product during 
the cultivation of microorganisms of the genera Emericella or Aspergillus, 
or via a complex chemical procedure as described in the aforecited 
US-A-4,521,432 (Takeda). The synthesis of R(+)- and S(-)-aminocarnitine chloride starting 
from L- and from D-asparagine was described by Schinagawa in J. Med. 
Chem., 30: 1458 (1987). However, this synthetic method is rather 
complex. Indeed, it includes seven steps and involves the use of 
particularly dangerous reagents, such as diazomethane. Therefore, it is 
not a method suitable for industrial production, and was of value only 
insofar as it permitted assignment of the absolute configurations of (+)-aminocarnitine 
and (-)-aminocarnitine as R-aminocarnitine and S-aminocarnitine, 
respectively. R-aminocarnitine chloride and S-aminocarnitine chloride can also 
be obtained by resolution of a racemic mixture of (±)-N-acetyl 
aminocarnitine, as described in SIGMA-TAU's Italian patent 1,205,758 
corresponding to EP-A-287,523. However, in this case the starting 
material, (±)-N-acetyl aminocarnitine, was synthesized as described by D. 
Jenkins in J. Biol. Chem., 260: 14748 (1985), using a rather complex  
 
five-step procedure starting with a uracil derivative. Alternatively, R(+)- and S(-)-aminocarnitine chloride can be 
obtained by resolution via silica gel chromatography or fractional 
crystallization of a diastereoisomer mixture consisting of N-[S(-) α-methylbenzyl]R(+) 
aminocarnitine benzylester chloride

<CLAIMS>
A process for producing aminocarnitine inner salt which comprises 
the steps of: 


(1) converting methanesulfonylcarnitine to a lactone by treating 
methanesulfonylcarnitine in a basic environment; 
(2) converting the lactone to azidocarnitine inner salt by treating the 
lactone with an azide for 2-6 hours, at 20-30°C; and 
(3) converting the azidocarnitine to aminocarnitine inner salt via 
catalytic hydrogenation in the presence of 10% Pd/C, at 2-4 bar (2-4 

hydrogen atmospheres), for 8-18 hours. 
The process of claim 1 for producing R-aminocarnitine inner salt, 
wherein in step (1) methanesulfonylcarnitine is R-methanesulfonylcarnitine. 
The process of claim 1 for producing S-aminocarnitine inner salt, 
wherein in step (1) methanesulfonylcarnitine is S-methanesulfonylcarnitine. 
The process of claims 1, 2 or 3, wherein in step (2) the azide is 
selected from lithium azide, sodium azide, diphenylphosphorylazide 

and trimethylsilylazide.
