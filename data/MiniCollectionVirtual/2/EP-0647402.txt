<ABSTRACT>
Machine for kneading dough is composed of a vat (1) which is driven in a rotary fashion and has a level floor and a cylindrical vat wall and of two kneading tools (2, 3) which engage in the vat from above in an eccentric fashion and circulate synchronously in opposite directions while being driven around spindles which are parallel to the axis of the vat and are approximately in the same plane as the latter. The kneading tools are composed of two bows, the diameters of the working regions of the two kneading tools being of different sizes.

A machine for kneading dough, consisting of a rotatingly driven tank (1) with a flat 
bottom and a cylindrical wall and two kneading tools (2, 3) engaging into the tank (1) 

eccentrically from above and which rotate being driven in opposite directions and in 
synchronism about axes (6, 7) disposed parallel and substantially in a common plane 

therewith and which consist of two curved members which comprise, disposed 
symmetrically of their axis of rotation (6, 7) and which are respectively connected at their 

ends facing the bottom of the tank by a transverse arm(14, 15) while having at their upper 
ends, fixed to a carrier hub (4, 5) longitudinal arms (16, 17) which pass through working 

areas (12, 13) portions of which overlap one another and which are cylindrical being fixed 
at their top ends to a carrier hub (4, 5), whereby the longitudinal arms (16, 17) are twisted 

in helical form in relation to the direction of rotation (9, 10) of the curved member which 
they form, the transverse arms (14, 15) of the curved members being offset in their angle 

of rotation in respect of one another, the curved member which faces the middle of the 
tank wiping over the tank axis (8) while the curved member (2) facing the walls of the 

tank has its working area adjacent the tank walls and also a direction of rotation opposite 
to that of the direction of rotation (11) of the tank (1), characterised in that the diameter 

of the working areas (12, 13) of the two kneading tools (2, 3) are of different sizes. 
A machine for kneading dough according to claim 1, characterised in that the kneading 
tool (3) which faces the middle of the tank has a greater diameter of working circle than 

the kneading tool (2) which is adjacent the tank wall. 
A machine according to claim 1 or 2, characterised in that the larger diameter kneading 
tool has a working circle diameter about 5% to 15% greater than that of the smaller 

kneading tool. 
A machine according to one of claims 1 to 3, characterised in that the difference in 
diameters amounts to about 10% related to the diameter of the smaller kneading tool.  

 
A machine according to one of claims 1 to 4, characterised in that the axial distance 
between the tool axes (6, 7) is about 15 to 25% and preferably about 16 to 20% smaller 

than the working circle diameter of the larger kneading tool (3). 
A machine according to one of claims 1 to 5, characterised in that the angle of rise of 
the longitudinal aims (16, 17) of the kneading tools (2, 3) is less than 53%.
