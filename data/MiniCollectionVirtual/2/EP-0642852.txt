<ABSTRACT>
A CVD diamond wire drawing die (11) has smaller diamond grains 
adjacent an initial diamond growth surface (13) with larger diamond 

grains adjacent an opposing surface (15) with an opening (12) having a 
wire bearing portion (17) of substantially circular cross-section 

determinative of the diameter of the wire positioned more 
closely adjacent to the opposing surface (13) in a region of larger 

grains than to the initial growth surface (15).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to diamond wire dies. Wires of metals such as tungsten, copper, iron, 
molybdenum, and stainless steel are produced by drawing the 
metals through diamond dies. Single crystal diamond dies are 
difficult to fabricate, tend to chip easily, easily cleave, and often 
fail catastrophically because of the extreme pressures involved 
during wire drawing. With reference to single crystal wire dies, it is reported in 
Properties and Applications of Diamond, Wilks et al, 
Butterworth-Heinemann Ltd 1991, pages 505-507: "The best 
choice of [crystallographic] direction is not too obvious because 
as the wire passes through the die its circumference is abrading 
the diamond on a whole 360Â° range of planes, and the rates of 
wear on these planes will be somewhat different. Hence, the 
originally circular hole will not only grow larger but will loose its 
shape. However, <110> directions offer the advantage that the 
wire is abrading the sides of the hole with {001} and {011} 
orientations in abrasion resistant directions." Diamond dies which avoid some of the problems 
attendant with natural diamonds of poorer quality comprise 
microporous masses compacted from tiny crystals of natural or 
synthesized diamonds or from crystals of diamond. The 
deficiencies of such polycrystalline hard masses, as indicated in 
U.S. patent 4,016,736, are due to the presence of microvoids/pores 
and soft inclusions. These voids and inclusions can 
be more than 10 microns in diameter. The improvement of the 
patent utilizes a metal cemented carbide jacket as a source of  
 
flowable metal which fills the voids resulting in an improved 
wire die. European Patent Application 0 494 799 A1 describes a 
polycrystalline CVD diamond layer having a hole formed 
therethrough and mounted in a support. As set forth in column 
2, lines 26-30, "The relatively random distribution of crystal 
orientations in the CVD diamond ensures more even wear 
during use of the insert." As set forth in column 3, lines 50-54, 
"The orientation of the diamond in the polycrystalline CVD 
diamond layer 10 may be such that most of the crystallites have 
a (111) crystallographic axis in the plane, i.e. parallel to the 
surfaces 14, 16, of the layer 10. Other crystal orientations for CVD films are known. U.S. 
patent 5,110,579 to Anthony et al describes a transparent 
polycrystalline diamond film as illustrated in Figure 3A, 
substantially transparent columns of diamond crystals having a 
<110> orientation perpendicular to the base. Because

<CLAIMS>
A die for drawing wire of a predetermined diameter 
comprising a CVD diamond body having a first surface in a 

region of larger diamond grains and a second surface in a region 
of smaller diamond grains, an opening extending through said 

body and having a wire bearing portion of substantially circular 
cross-section determinative of the diameter of the wire 

positioned more closely adjacent to said first surface in said 
region of larger grains than to said second surface in a region of 

smaller diamond grains. 
A die for drawing wire in accordance with claim 1 wherein 
said second surface corresponds to an initially diamond growth 

surface. 
A die for drawing wire in accordance with claim 1 wherein 
said opening extends entirely through said body along an axial 

direction from said second surface to said first surface, said 
body including diamond grains having a 
<
110
>
 orientation 
extending substantially along the axial direction. 
A die for drawing wire in accordance with claim 3 wherein 
said wire bearing portion comprises a straight bore section 

having a circular cross section. 
A die for drawing wire in accordance with claim 3 wherein 
said opening tapers outwardly in one direction from said 

straight bore section toward said first surface and tapers 
outwardly in the opposite direction toward said second surfaces. 
A die for drawing wire in accordance with claim 5 wherein 
said outward taper in said one direction forms a exit taper for 

the wire and said outward taper in the other direction toward 
said second surface forms an entrance taper. 
A die for drawing wire in accordance with claim 6 wherein 
said entrance taper extends for a greater distance along the axial 

direction than exit taper. 
A die for drawing wire in accordance with claim 5 wherein 
said body has a thickness as measured from one surface to the 

other surface of about 0.3-10 millimeters. 
A die for drawing wire in accordance with claim 5 wherein 
said diamond is grown by chemical vapor deposition on a 

substrate by a filament process. Selected from the group 
consisting of Si, Ge, Mo, Hb, V, Ta, W, Ti, Zr or Hf or alloys 

thereof. 
A die for drawing wire in accordance with claim 5 wherein 
said diamond comprises a film of substantially transparent 

columns of diamond crystals having a 
<
110

 orientation 
perpendicular to the second surface.
