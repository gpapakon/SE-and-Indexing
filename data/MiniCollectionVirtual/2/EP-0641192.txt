<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to mucosal adhesives. 
In another aspect this invention relates to 
compositions that adhere to oral mucosa. In yet 
another aspect this invention relates to methods of 
transmucosal drug delivery. Buccal tablets and like devices are known 
and disclosed for example in U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,740,365 
and 4,764,378. These devices adhere to mucosal 
surfaces and dissolve or otherwise disintegrate over 
time, thus delivering drug into the mouth of the 
patient in a sustained fashion. It is also known that 
delivery of drugs across the oral mucosa avoids hepatic 
first-pass inactivation, inactivation by 
gastro-intestinal fluids, and other modes of 
inactivation characteristic of oral drug ingestion. 
Sustained release adhesive bandages, patches, and the 
like that contain drugs and adhere to mucosal surfaces 
are known to the art. This invention provides a transmucosal drug 
delivery device in the form of a sheet material having 
a surface intended to be adhered to a mucosal surface, 
comprising: 
1) a particulate polymeric resin 
comprising carboxylic acid containing monomer 
units and having an average particle size of 
less than or equal to 100 µm; 2) from 10 parts to 200 parts 
by weight of a polytetrafluoroethylene support  
 
matrix based on 100 parts by weight of the 
resin; and 3) an amount of a drug effective to 
provide a desired therapeutic result;  
   which composition contains less than 
10% water by weight based on the weight of the 
polymeric resin, and adheres to a mucosal surface for a 
time sufficient to release the drug to the mucosal 
surface. A device of this invention exhibits good 
adherence to human oral mucosa. Also, the drug is 
released in sustained fashion over a prolonged period 
to a mucosal surface or to the vicinity of a mucosal 
surface for, for example, local or systemic treatment. In a preferred embodiment the device further 
comprises a flexible film backing adhered to one side 
of the device. This invention also provides therapeutic 
methods. One such method is a method of achieving 
and/or maintaining a therapeutically effective blood 
level of a drug in a mammal, comprising the steps of: 
a) adhering a device of the invention to a 
mucosal surface of a mammal; and b) allowing the device to remain adhered for 
a time sufficient to release the drug such that a 
therapeutically effective blood level of drug is 
achieved and/or maintained. Another such method is a method of delivering 
a drug to a mucosal surface of a mammal or to the 
vicinity of a
