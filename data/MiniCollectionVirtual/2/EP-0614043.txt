<ABSTRACT>
A fluidized bed reactor (10) in which a 
bed of particulate material (25) is supported in a furnace 

section. A portion (25b) of the bed receives a greater amount 
of fluidizing gas to increase the stoichiometric 

conditions in the bed portion, strip relatively fine 
material from the particulate material in the bed portion 

and increase the amount of heat transferred to the flue 
gases. A cooler (40) is located adjacent the furnace section 

for receiving particulate material from the bed portion.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a fluidized bed reactor and
method for operating same and, more particularly, to a
fluidized bed reactor utilizing a strip-air system for
reducing the heat content of, and removing the relatively
fine particulate material from, the waste solids drained
from the furnace section of the reactor while at the same
time increasing the reactor's combustion efficiency.Reactors, such as combustors, steam generators and
the like, which utilize fluidized beds as their primary
source of heat generation, are well known. In these
arrangements, air is passed into the furnace section of
the reactor and through a bed of particulate material
contained therein which includes a mixture of a fossil
fuel, such as coal, and an adsorbent, such as limestone,
to adsorb the sulphur generated as a result of the 
combustion of the coal. The air fluidizes the bed and
promotes the combustion of the fuel.To improve the pollution characteristics of fluidized
bed reactors, it is known to stage the combustion of the
fuel by controlling the amount of oxygen in various
regions of the fluidized bed. In general, the lower
region of the fluidized bed is operated under fuel rich or
substoichiometric conditions such that nitrogen oxides
emissions are reduced. The upper region is then operated
under oxygen rich or oxidizing conditions to complete the
combustion of the fuel.Each region of the fluidized bed is comprised of a
homogenous mixture of particles of fuel and adsorbent,
with a portion of the fuel particles being unburned, a
portion being partially burned and a portion being
completely burned; and a portion of the adsorbent being
unreacted, a portion being partially reacted and a portion
being completely reacted. The particulate material must
be discharged from the system efficiently to accommodate
the introduction of fresh fuel and adsorbent. To this
end, a portion of the particulate material is usually
passed from the lower region of the bed through a drain
pipe to remove that portion from the reactor system. It has been found, however, that the particle size
distribution in a fluidized bed, an important operating
parameter, can be effectively controlled by recirculating
part of this removed particulate material back to the
furnace section. This is often accomplished by blowing
air through the removed particulate material to strip away
and entrain the finer portions of the particulate material
and returning them to the furnace section.For example, in U.s. Patent No. 4,829,912

A fluidized bed reactor comprising a furnace section
(12), supporting means (78) for supporting a bed (81) of

particulate material in the furnace section (68), plenum
(76) extending immediately below the supporting means (78),

passing means for passing gas from the plenum (76) through
the supporting means (78) and into bed (81), means (82a,

82b) for supplying gas at different gas flows to two
sections (81a, 81b) of the bed selectively to fluidize the

respective bed portions in the two sections (81a, 81b) and combust the fuel therein,
means (66) for removing particulate material from the bed

portion (81b) in the furnace section (12) having the
greater gas flow relative the other bed portion (81a), and

a vessel (40) for receiving the removed particulate
material, whereby partition means (86) extend

above the supporting means (78) for partitioning
the furnace section (12) extending above the

supporting means into the said two sections (81a, 81b) the
partition means (86) including openings (86a, 86b) to allow

the passage of particulate material between said two
sections (81a, 81b) and means are provided to cool the

removed particulate material in the vessel (40).
The reactor of Claim 1 in which the means for
supplying gas at different gas flows comprise two gas

sources respectively connected to the two plenum portions,
and two valves connected to the said sources.
The reactor of Claim 1 in which nozzles (82a, 82b)
extend from the plenum (26) through the supporting means

(78) to supply gas to the bed, those nozzles (82b)

a relatively larger cross-sectional area than the other
nozzles (82a).

means (86) have openings (86a, 86b) to allow passage of the

particulate material between the bed portions (81a, 81b).
The reactor of any preceding claim in which the means

(66) for removing particulate material comprise a duct (66)
connecting the furnace section (12) to the vessel (40) for

permitting the removed particulate material to pass from
the furnace section (12) to the vessel (40).
The reactor of any preceding claim further comprising

section (68) containing the bed (81) of particulate material being divided into two
sections (81a, 81b) by partition means (86), the partition means (86) including
