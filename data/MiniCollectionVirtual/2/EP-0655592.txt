<ABSTRACT>
In an arrangement for cooling of foodstuffs (1), especially in an aircraft, which are stored in transport containers (8) generally known, the transport containers (8) occupying prescribed reserved places (8) inside the aircraft, preferably in at least one onboard kitchen (airplane kitchen), the invention comprises assigning a heat exchanging device (9) to the transport container (8) for approximately every reserved place (7). A secondary circuit which absorbs cooling energy at the heat exchanging device (9) and outputs the cooling energy again to the transport containers circulates chiefly in heat carrier lines in the walls of the transport container (8). The invention also provides that the heat exchanging device (9) is connected to a cooler (4) and that the heat exchanging device (9) and at least one side of the transport container (9) are provided with contact surfaces (10, 14') which are in contact with one another in order to guarantee the conduction of heat. It is advantageous that a substantially improved efficiency is achieved in the cooling circuit. There is a reduction in leaks and leaky locations inside the arrangement.

Arrangement for cooling foodstuffs, particularly in an
aircraft, which are stored in generally known transport

containers (8) and the transport containers (8) adopt
predetermined positioning locations (7) inside the

aircraft, preferably in at least one galley (3a to 3e),
wherein a heat-exchanging apparatus (9) is associated

with the transport container (8) at a positioning
location (7) in each case, the heat-exchanging apparatus

(9) is connected to a cooling plant and there circulates,
in heat carrier lines (15) in the transport container

(8), a secondary circuit which takes on a cooling
exergonic property at the heat-exchanging apparatus (9)

and gives off the cooling exergonic property again to the
transport container (8),
characterised in that

heat carrier lines (15) extend in the outer walls of the
transport container (8), and the heat-exchanging

apparatus (9) and at least one wall of the transport
container (8), in which wall heat carrier lines (15)

extend at least partially, are provided with contact
faces (10, 14') which are in contact with one another in

order to guarantee the conduction of heat between the
heat-exchanging apparatus (9) and the heat carrier lines

(15).
Arrangement for cooling foodstuffs, in accordance with
claim 1,
characterised in that

a regulating apparatus (11) is associated with the
