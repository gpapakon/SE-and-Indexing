<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to generally to 
inspection of irregularity or unsteadiness possibly 
appearing on the surface of objects, specimens and the like, 
and more specifically to a method and apparatus for 
detecting surface irregularity of objects, e.g., less 
conspicuous spots with imperceptible boundary scattered on 
an object surface, blot zones of differing density often 
present on the patternless homogeneous surface of a 
monolithic object, flaws on a patternless sheet-like 
specimen, and positional defects in an array of objects 
arranged at a predetermined pitch. Even more particularly, 
the instant invention is directed to a method and apparatus 
capable of examining stains or stain areas, minute flaws 
and crosswise defects of unclear boundary with no 
remarkable brightness difference, frequently appearing on 
the surface of various articles. As is conventional, in the liquid crystal display 
hereinafter referred to as "LCD", there occurs an occasion 
that the color filters 
thereof partially become bright or dark due mainly to the 
presence of dyeing stains. Likewise, spots of, e.g., 
differing density or thickness may be created in case of a 
monochromic patternless woven fabric attached to the  
 
ceiling of motor vehicles or a similar nonwoven fabric 
patch used as a drug carrier. This holds true for the 
shadow mask of 
a color cathode ray tube. Namely, electron beam 
penetration holes formed through the shadow mask may have 
irregular configuration or may be distributed in an 
erroneous spacing or pattern. In addition to the above, 
minute defects or alien matters are often found in a 
patternless film or an aluminum sheet for use in making 
beverage cans. In accordance with the prior art approach, such a 
surface irregularity of object articles has been detected 
through the use of an inspection apparatus that includes a 
line sensor and an image processor associated therewith. 
The inspection apparatus is designed to find out surface 
defects by way of first scanning the surface of the object 
articles to obtain brightness information for each and 
every pixel and subsequently determining whether the 
respective brightness information falls within a 
permissible range. As a more specific prior art example, the surface 
examination device shown in Fig.1 has been used to detect a 
stain 2 possibly present on a LCD color Filter 1. This 
device comprises a line sensor 10, an image processor 11 
and a display 12 wherein the image process 11 is, in turn, 
provided with a plurality
