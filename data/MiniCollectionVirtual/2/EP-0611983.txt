<ABSTRACT>
A photo-printing apparatus is provided which 
includes projection exposure means for projection-exposing 

an image formed on a film, digital exposure means for 
exposing a digital image, reader means for reading print 

size data and image data of one roll of film, and control 
means for calculating a digital exposure position on the 

basis of the print size data and image data read by the 
reader means and conveying a photosensitive material to 

the digital exposure position, whereby a series of 
printing operations of the projection exposure means is 

achieved in parallel with a series of digital printing 
operations of the digital exposure means.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a photo-printing apparatus and, more particularly,
to a photo-printing apparatus capable of printing by projection exposure
in parallel with printing by exposure of a digital image such as index
printing, for one roll of film.With a conventional photo-printing apparatus, digital printing is unable to be
performed during ordinary printing, and vice versa. Further, while either of
the digital printing and the ordinary printing is performed, the other functions
of the apparatus including the printing function for the rest are unable to be
used effectively. Moreover, since index print and ordinary print must be separately
exposed and developed, lengthy operations are needed to complete a
series of printing processes.The US-A-5,184,227, which is the starting point of the present invention, discloses
a photographic printer having a print station for generating photographic
prints from photographic film frame images and an exposure determination
film frame image scanner used in determining print exposure operating
conditions at the print station. The printer is provided with an index print
signal generator responsive to the output of the exposure determination film
scanner to produce a matrix of film frame image signals from which index
prints are produced by the print station. Thus both printing operations,
printing the photographic film frame images and printing of the index print,
are done sequentially one after the other,The EP-A-0 308 967 discloses a photographic printer having a print station
for printing photographic film frame images and means for electronically taking
and filing the image data of each frame. After the ordinary printing of
each frame on the photographic paper is finished the index print is printed
onto the photographic paper using the filed image data and part of the
aforementioned print station.Therefore the process of printing photographic film frame images and printing
the index print, as disclosed in US-A-5,184,227 and EP-A-0 308 967, needs
filing all index print data in separate memories for separate printing and thus
is complicated and time consuming. It is, therefore, an object of the present invention to overcome the foregoing
problems and to provide a photo-printing apparatus in which exposure time
is remarkably reduced.In accordance with the present invention, there is provided a photo-printing
apparatus comprising projection exposure means for projection-exposing an
image formed on a film, digital exposure means for exposing a digital image,

</DESCRIPTION>
<CLAIMS>
A photo-printing apparatus comprising:

projection exposure means (3) for projection-exposing an image formed on a film (F),
digital exposure means (2) for exposing a digital image,
characterized by
means being disposed between the digital exposure means (2) and the
projections exposure means (3) for sagging the continuous photosensitive

material (P) to stock a portion of the continuous photosensitive material (P),
reader means (6) for reading print size data and image data of one roll of film
(F), and
control means (7) for calculating a digital exposure position on the basis of
the print size data and image data read by the reader means (6), for conveying

a first part of a continuous photosensitive material (P) to a projection exposure
position and a second part of the continuous photosensitive material

(P) to a digital exposure position, and for controlling printing operations of
the projection exposure means (3) to the first part of the continuous photosensitive

material (P) at the projection exposure position simultaneously with
controlling printing operations of the digital exposure means (2) to the second

part of the continuous photosensitive material (P) at the digital exposure
position.
The photo-printing apparatus of claim 1, wherein said means for sagging
are provided with conveyor means (14, 15) for partially

sagging the continuous photosensitive material (P) to stock the continuous
photosensitive material (P), and wherein said control means (7) controls said

conveyor means (14, 15), said projection exposure means (3) and said digital 
exposure means (2) to convey said continuous photosensitive material (P)

and to projection-expose simultaneously with the digital exposure.
The photo-printing apparatus of claim 1 or 2, wherein said digital exposure
means (2) exposes a digital image of an index print by digital exposure based

on said image data of the one roll of film (F) read by the reader means (6), and
wherein said control means (7) controls the conveyance of the continuous

photosensitive material (P) so that the second part of the continuous photosensitive
material (P) is made continuous with one end of a series of projection-exposed

prints of said one roll of film (F).
