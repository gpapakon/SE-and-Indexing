<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to novel pharmaceutically active aminooxy compounds, 
processes for the preparation of these compounds, pharmaceutical compositions 
comprising these compounds, these compounds for use in a prophylactic, therapeutic or 
diagnostic method for the treatment of the human or animal body, and the use of these 
compounds for the prophylactic or therapeutic treatment of the human or animal body and 
for the preparation of pharmaceutical compositions. According to the current state of knowledge, there are a number of states of the human or 
animal body which can be influenced favourably by inhibition of polyamine biosynthesis. The enzyme ornithine decarboxylase (ODC) is one of the key enzymes of polyamine 
biosynthesis. A reduction in the activity of ODC leads to a reduced polyamine 
biosynthesis and therefore to reduced polyamine levels in the cell. If inhibition of the 
activity of this enzyme by ODC inhibitors can be achieved, the polyamine concentration 
in mammalian cells (including human cells) can be influenced, i.e. lowered, with the aid 
of such ODC inhibitors. In mammalian cells, ODC catalyses the synthesis of putrescine, an intermediate in 
polyamine biosynthesis. The breakdown of putrescine in the cell is effected in particular 
by diamine oxidase (DAO). If the DAO is active, excess putrescine can be broken down, 
which further promotes the action of an ODC inhibitor. The less an inhibitor of ODC 
inhibits DAO, i.e. the higher its specificity, the more advantageous its properties. The compound of the formula 
  
 
with the name 1-aminooxy-3-aminopropane (APA) is known. This compound is a potent 
inhibitor of ODC, but is not selective with respect to diamine oxidase. Furthermore, 
according to Eloranta et al., Life Chemistry Reports Volume 9, 163-169 (1991), it has 
practically no action in whole animal tests. EP-A-0 369 944 described substituted aminooxy compounds carrying substituents which are bonded to the central chain by a polar atom. It has now been found, surprisingly, that the compounds according to the invention 
described in this invention which carry, on the central carbon chain, substituents which are 
bonded directly to the central carbon chain merely by a non-polar carbon atom belonging 
to the substituent, and the terminal polar groups of which are partly sterically hindered and 
protected from metabolic breakdown by the substituents mentioned, have advantageous 
pharmacological properties. The compounds are potent inhibitors of ornithine decarboxylase.
