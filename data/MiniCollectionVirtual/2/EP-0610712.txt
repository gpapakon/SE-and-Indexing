<ABSTRACT>
A method for attaching a grooved precured tread 
12 to a tire casing 10 and an apparatus to facilitate 

the attachment is described. A precured rubber tread 
12 is applied to the tire casing 10 having a cushion 

gum layer 16 disposed between them. An envelope 
system 18 is placed over the tread 12 and casing 10 

combination. The envelope system 18 includes a 
flexible membrane 18 and an air venting rigid body 40. 

The use of the rigid body 40 permits the evacuation of 
air from under the envelope 18 without requiring an 

air permeable membrane to be attached over the tread 
12.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates generally to a method for 
attaching a grooved precured tread to a tire casing. Traditionally, and as illustrated in Figure 1, a 
precured rubber tread 12 is applied over the crown 
region 14 of the tire casing 10 in which a layer of 
vulcanizable rubber based material 16 or cushion gum 
is interposed between the tread 12 and the tire casing 
10. A flexible airtight member or envelope 18 is then 
placed over the tread 12 to cover at least a portion 
of the sidewalls 20 of the tire casing 10. This 
envelope 18, by evacuation, allows air to be removed 
from the region between the tread and casing and helps 
to provide pressure to the tread 12 to enhance the 
bonding of the tread 12 to the tire casing 10. It has 
been found that this method does not insure that air 
entrapped between the envelope and the tread carcass 
assembly is adequately removed. To facilitate removal 
of this entrapped air, many have employed a wick pad 
30 or a perforated layer between the tread 12 and the 
flexible membrane 18. These air permeable layers 30 
allow the air to escape through the air permeable 
layer 30 to an envelope valve stem 24 which is 
provided on the outer periphery of the envelope. This 
valve stem is then attached to a hose which will 
permit the evacuation of this entrapped air. Such a 
system is described in Witherspoon, U.S. Patent No. 
4,309,234. These wick pads 30 are commonly wrapped around 
the circumference of the tread 12 and stapled to it. 
It has been determined that such stapling can lead to 
premature failures of the flexible envelope 18. When  
 
the flexible envelope fails during the curing 
procedure a resultant infiltration of air, steam or 
other contaminants between the tread and the tire 
casing will likely occur resulting in the loss of the 
tire. Additionally, the wick systems 30 currently 
employed have a limited useful life. As a result, the 
use of such wicks 30 increase the cost of the finished 
product. A variety of methods to cure a precured tread to 
a tire casing have been developed over the years. 
Several such systems are disclosed in Schelkmann et 
al. U.S. Patent Nos. 3,325,326 and 4,151,027 and 
Brewer U.S. Patent No. 4,434,018 and Lindsey et al. 
U.S. Patent No. 5,055,148. In these described methods 
for curing a tread to a tire, it is often found 
desirable to provide the wick pad as described above 
for facilitating the removal of entrapped air between 
the tread carcass assembly and the flexible envelope. 
The present invention permits the removal

<CLAIMS>
A method for attaching a precured, grooved 
tread (12) to the casing (10) of a pneumatic tire, the 

method including the steps of: 

a) applying a layer of curable material (16) 
circumferentially about the exterior of the tire in its 

crown region; 
b) applying the precured, grooved tread (12) 
circumferentially about the exterior of the tire (10) in 

its crown region, the curable material (16) being between 
the tread (12) and casing (10); 
c) placing an envelope (18) over the tread 
(12) and a portion of each sidewall (20) of the tire 

casing (10) to form an assembly, the envelope (18) being 
circumferentially sealed with the tire on both sides of 

the tire; 
d) placing the assembly in a curing chamber; 
e) pressurizing and heating the chamber; and 
f) evacuating the region between the envelope 

(18) and tread (12); 
 
   the method being characterized by carryout of the 

evacuation of step f) above by withdrawing air from 
between the envelope (18) and tread (12) through a 

passage (42) in a rigid body (40), the rigid body (40) 
being narrow in width placed between the envelope (18) 

and tread (12) and the passage (42) in the body (40) 
communicating with at least one of the grooves (32) in 

the tread (12). 
The method of claim 1 wherein the rigid body 
(40) extends from tread edge (28) to tread edge (28) 

communicating with a plurality of circumferentially 
extending grooves (32).  

 
The method of claim 1 wherein the rigid body 
(40) has a width occupying less than one percent of the 

circumferential length of the tread (12). 
The method of claim 1 wherein the rigid body 
(40) has a width of less than 10 cm. 
The method of claim 1 wherein during evacuation 
the envelope (18) is free to extend into the location of 

the circumferential grooves (32) to apply chamber 
pressure to the walls of the grooves (32) except at the 

location of the rigid body (40).
