<ABSTRACT>
A connection terminal includes a pair of connection 
portions (2A,2B) interconnected through a fusion portion (3), and each of 

the connection portions is defined by a bottom plate (5A,5B), opposite 
side plates (6A,6B,7A,7B) formed respectively on opposite sides 

of the bottom 
plate, and a top plate (8A,8B). A spring portion (9A,9B) extending 

from the 
top plate is folded back from a front side thereof to be 

disposed within the connection portion so that a mating 
connection terminal can be held between the spring portion and 

the bottom plate. The connection terminal is stamped from an 
electrically-conductive metal sheet in such a manner that the 

spring portion extending from the top plate is extended along 
and disposed generally adjacent to the fusion portion before 

the spring portion is folded back.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a connection terminal with a
fuse according to the preamble of claim 1 used in an automobile or the like for protecting a load
circuit against an excess current and to a method for manufacturing such
a connection terminal.A fuse element made of a copper alloy or the like has
heretofore been used for protecting a circuit through which an
excess current several times larger than a stationary current
flows immediately after starting the operation as in a motor
load circuit of an automobile. Such a fuse element integral
with a terminal portion has been stamped from a copper alloy
sheet.However, such a copper alloy has a high fusion
temperature, and therefore when a minimum operating current
which causes the fuse to be fused, or a current close to it is
caused to flow for a long period of time, the fusion portion is
maintained at high temperatures for a long period of time, so
that a problem with fuse characteristics has been encountered.Under the circumstances, there has been made an attempt
(as in a fuse disclosed in Japanese Utility Model Unexamined
Publication No. 3-35640) in which a fuse is provided as a
separate element, and only this element is made of low-melting
metal. However, this increases the number of steps of the 
manufacturing process, and therefore is disadvantageous in that
the cost becomes high.Therefore, there has been made an attempt in which an
integral construction is formed from a sheet of a metal alloy
having a high fusion temperature, and contrivance is applied to
a fusion portion, as shown in Fig. 5. Fig. 5(a) is a bottom
view of a conventional connection terminal 51 for a fuse. The
conventional connection terminal 51 for a fuse includes a
fusion portion 53 of a projected configuration provided between
connection portions 52A and 52B having respective curl portions
54A and 54B. Fig. 5(b) is a developed view of this connection
terminal, and those portions (having a length Lc in their flat
form) to be formed respectively into the curl portions are
curled during a shaping operation to respectively form the curl
portions 54A and 54B having a curvature as shown in Fig. 5(c)
which is a front-elevational view.In the manufacture of this connection terminal, a
copper alloy sheet is stamped by a press into a developed
configuration as shown in Fig. 5(b). However, it has been
difficult to effect the stamping in such a manner that the
fusion portion 53, as well as narrow interconnecting portions
extending right and left respectively from the fusion portion
53, is

<CLAIMS>
A connection terminal (1;11) with a fuse comprising:

a pair of connection members (2A,2B;12A,12B) interconnected through a
fusion portion (3;13) each of said connection members (2A,2B;12A,12B) including

a bottom plate (5A,5B;15A,15B) and opposite side plates (6A,7A,6B,7B;
16A,17A,16B,17B) formed respectively on opposite sides of said bottom

plate (5A,5B;15A,15B);
characterized
 in that each of said connection members (2A,2B;12A,12B)
further includes


a top plate (8A,8B;18A,18B) extended continuously from one of the opposite side
plates (6A,7A,6B,7B;16A,17A,16B, 17B); and
a spring member (10A,10B;20A,20B) disposed within the top plate
(8A,8B;18A,18B) and extending from a front side thereof so as to hold a

terminal (60) between said spring member (10A,10B;20A,20B) and said
bottom plate (5A,5B;15A,15B).
A method of manufacturing a connection terminal with a fuse as claimed in
claim 1, wherein said connection terminal (1;11) is stamped from an

electrically-conductive metal sheet in such a manner that a spring portion
(9A,9B;19A,19B) in which said spring member (10A,10B; 20A,20B) is formed, extending from the corresponding top plate (8A,8B;18A,18B) is extended along and disposed generally adjacent to said fusion portion (3;13)

before said spring portion (9A,9B;19A,19B) is folded back inwardly at the
front end of the top plate (8A,8B;18A;18B), whereby the spring

portion (9A,9B;19A,19B) is disposed within the connection
members (2A,2B;12A,12B) and the spring member (10A,10B;20A,20B)

is resiliently projected toward the bottom plate (5A,5B;15A,15B).
