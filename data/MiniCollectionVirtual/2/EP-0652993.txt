<DESCRIPTION>
 ARCHIVAL APERTURE CARD BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTIONThe present invention relates generally to card stock for photosensitive film mounts. In particular, the present invention is an aperture card (ie. , a paper card with an opening in which a frame of film is mounted) suitable for archival storage.Aperture cards such as that shown in FIG. 1 are commonly used for the handling and storage of photosensitive film such as microfilm frames bearing images of engineering drawings or other information. Aperture cards are typically of standard data processing punch card size, and include an aperture or hole sized to receive the microfilm frame. Strips of adhesive tape or other fasteners are used to mount the microfilm frame within the aperture or otherwise to the card.Cameras, plotters, printers, duplicators and other types of equipment are used to process the information stored on aperture cards. Mechanical handling mechanisms drive the aperture cards within this equipment. To ensure consistent and reliable operation of the handling mechanisms, the aperture cards are manufactured to relatively strict specifications such as ANSI specification X311- 1969. By way of example, some of the specifications and properties of conventional aperture cards commercially available from 3M of St. Paul, Minnesota, U.S.A., the assignee of the present invention, are as follows:PROPERTY LIMITSThickness 0.007" Â± 0.004Burst (Mullen) 55 minimumStiffness (Taber V-5) 17.0 minimum M.D. 8.0 minimum CD.Folding Endurance(MTT) 100 minimum M.D.100 minimum CD.

The bulk of the formulation is a slurry of bleached hardwood and softwood chemical pulp, generally in a 60/40 to 80/20 hardwood to softwood ratio. Alum (Aluminum Sulfate) is added to the slurry for pH control, retention of additives such as internal sizing agents, and formation improvement. Retention and formation aids such as
