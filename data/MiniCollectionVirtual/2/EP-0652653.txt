<ABSTRACT>
Optical waves (W1, W2) carrying a signal to be transmitted (S) are guided in a line consisting of optical fibres exhibiting chromatic dispersion. In order to compensate for the effects of this dispersion, a phenomenon of four-wave mixing is caused at an intermediate point of the line, by the use of a pumping light injected into a mixing fibre (8). According to the invention, this pumping light consists of two pump waves (P1, P2). The polarisations (V1, V2) of these two waves are orthogonal. Their optical frequencies (@P1, @P2) are substantially symmetric to one another with respect to a neutral frequency (@o) cancelling the chromatic dispersion of this mixing fibre. The invention applies particularly to links of great length.
