<ABSTRACT>
The gas pressure controller has a housing (1) with an input (2), an output (3) and an actuator (4) arranged between them. A diaphragm (9), which effects or controls the movement of the actuator (4), delimits a chamber (10) which is connected, via at least one opening (12), to the output (3) or a control pressure source. According to the invention, the opening (12) opens into a gas distributor annular channel (11) arranged concentrically with respect to the diaphragm and is arranged and designed in such a manner that pressure equalisation between the gas distributor annular channel (11) and the chamber (10) essentially takes place uniformly over the periphery of the chamber (10). Preferably, a plurality of openings (12) are provided, which are designed as channels which are arranged with respect to one another in a star shape with a peripheral spacing from one another.
