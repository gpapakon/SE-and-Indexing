<ABSTRACT>
In a mixing chamber, a gaseous secondary stream is injected into a gaseous ducted main stream. The secondary stream has a significantly smaller mass flow rate than the main stream. The main stream is conducted via vortex generators (9) of which a plurality are arranged adjacently over the width or the periphery of the duct (20) through which the flow passes. The height (h) of the vortex generators is at least 50 % of the height (H) of the duct through which flow passes. The secondary stream is introduced into the duct (20) in the immediate vicinity of the vortex generators (9). By means of the novel static mixer, which the three-dimensional vortex generators represent, it is possible to achieve extremely short mixing paths in the mixing chamber with simultaneously low pressure drop.
