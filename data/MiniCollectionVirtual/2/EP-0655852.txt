<ABSTRACT>
The present invention provides a facsimile apparatus 
which enables the printer section and document original 

reading section thereof to be used as a printer means and 
image reading means, respectively, for a personal computer. To 

use the reading section (2) for reading a document original as 
the image reading means for the personal computer (15), the 

operation mode of the facsimile apparatus (20) is switched 
from an ordinary operation mode to a PC-FAX mode. When a 

document original is read by the reading section (2) in the 
PC-FAX mode, the facsimile apparatus (20) behaves as if it 

received a call-in of facsimile correspondence, and sends 
image data to the personal computer (15). Further, by 

operating an operation section (7), a printer function call 
number is registered for an external input printing function 

which enables information input to an interface (10) to be 
printed out. When a call-out command designating a phone 

number is sent to the facsimile apparatus (20) from the 
personal computer (15), a control section (1) judges if the 

phone number agrees with the printer function call number. If 

the input number agrees with the printer function call number, 
information input from the personal computer (15) is printed 

out by a printer section (6).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a facsimile apparatus
capable of connecting with information processing apparatus
such as a personal computer and performing data communications
therebetween.A function of carrying out a direct facsimile
transmission of a document prepared by means of a personal
computer and receiving image data transmitted from a facsimile
apparatus via a telephone line is referred to as PC-FAX. To
realize the PC-FAX function, a personal computer is connected
through a fax modem having a facsimile communication function
to a telephone line or, alternatively, connected to a
facsimile apparatus having a data communication interface such
as RS-232C. An example of such an apparatus is described in WO-A-93/20647.An operation of taking information received by a facsimile
apparatus into a personal computer is as follows. First, the
operation mode of the facsimile apparatus is switched from an
ordinary operation mode to a PC-FAX mode. The PC-FAX mode can
be set by sending an instruction in a form of a control
command called AT command from the personal computer. In the 
PC-FAX mode, information received in accordance with a
facsimile communication procedure is sent to the personal
computer. On the other hand, information received in the
ordinary operation mode is printed out in a printer section of
the facsimile apparatus.The procedure of transmitting via the facsimile apparatus
a document prepared by means of the personal computer is as
follows. First, a document file to be transmitted is prepared
by means of the personal computer. Then, the personal
computer controls the facsimile apparatus by way of a control
command called AT command to give the facsimile apparatus a
phone number of a recipient facsimile apparatus and an
instruction to carry out a facsimile transmission. In
response thereto, the facsimile apparatus calls out the
recipient facsimile apparatus, and carries out facsimile
transmission of data sent from the personal computer via a
data communication interface.The facsimile apparatus typically comprises a document
original reading section for reading a document original to be
transmitted and a printer section for printing out an image
transmitted via a telephone line. On the other hand, the
personal computer to be connected to the facsimile apparatus
is typically connected to a printer, and sometimes connected
to an image scanner for reading an image.Since the facsimile apparatus includes the printer 
section having a printing function, the printer separately
connected to the

<CLAIMS>
A facsimile apparatus comprising:

an information input/output section (10) capable of
communicating with an external information processing

apparatus such as a computer (15);
a memory means (19) for storing a predetermined phone number
registered therein; characterized by,
a judging means (1, S3, S13) for judging, when a phone
number is input, whether or not the input phone number agrees

with said predetermined phone number registered in said memory
means (19); and
a special processing means (1, S5, S15) for performing a
predetermined processing other than an ordinary facsimile

communication processing in response to a judgment made by
said judging means that the input phone number agrees with

said predetermined phone number.
A facsimile apparatus as set forth in claim 1, further
comprising:


a printer means (6) for printing an image;
said printer means (6) being adapted to be actuated by
said special processing means (1, S5), in response to a

judgment made by said judging means (1, S3) that said
predetermined phone number agrees with a phone number which is

input along with transmission information via the information

input/output section (10), to print out the input transmission 
information.
A facsimile apparatus as set forth in claim 2, further
comprising:


a facsimile function performing means (1, 8, S4) for
