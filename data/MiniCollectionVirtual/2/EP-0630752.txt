<ABSTRACT>
An ink jet recording method using a number of 
ejection outlets for ejecting ink includes grouping a 

number of ejection outlets into a plurality of groups 
such that ejection regions are partly overlapped; and 

supplying driving signals in such an order that 
ejection regions of groups of ejection outlets are 

partly overlapped.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an ink jet
recording method and apparatus in which ink is ejected
from a recording head to a recording material to effect
the recording.In a recording apparatus such as a printer, copying
machine, facsimile machine or the like, an image
constituted by a dot pattern is recorded on a recording
material such as paper or a thin sheet of plastic
material in accordance with image information. The
recording apparatus is classified depending on the
recording system into an ink jet type, a wire dot type,
a thermal type, a laser beam type and the like. Among
them, the ink jet type (ink jet recording apparatus) is
such that ink (recording liquid) droplets are ejected
through ejection outlets of a recording head, to effect
the recording by deposition of the ink on the recording
material.US-A-4809016 and W091/08902 disclose methods of ink
jet recording where dots printed on a recording material
are partly overlapped. EP-A-0308272 discloses a
recording head having staggered nozzle groups in the scan
direction. Nozzles overlapping between parallel lines
and adjacent lines of ejection head outlets are disclosed
in EP-A-0339926 and US-A-4611219 respectively.Recently, various types of recording apparatuses are
used, and high speed recording, high resolution, high 
image quality, low noise or the like are desired for
these recording apparatuses. To meet the requirement,
the ink jet recording apparatus is suitable. Since non-contact
printing is possible because of ejecting the ink
from the recording head, very stabilised images can be
printed.However, it uses ink which is liquid, and therefore,
if the recording head is driven at or adjacent a critical
printing speed, various hydromechanism inconveniences
arise. In addition, since the ink is liquid, the
physical states thereof such as viscosity or surface
tension or the like change due to ambient temperature or
the time period in which it is not used. For example,
even if printing is possible in an initial state,
printing may become difficult due to the increase of the
vacuum due to the decrease of the ambient temperature
and/or the decrease of the remaining quantity of the ink
in the container, or the like.In many of prior art printers, a plurality of
nozzles are all driven in as short period as possible so
as to record a vertical line as a straight line. In most
cases, several tens of nozzles are grouped into blocks
each containing several nozzles, and they are
simultaneously driven to accomplish high speed operation.
In this case, if the
