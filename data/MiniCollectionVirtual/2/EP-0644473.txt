<ABSTRACT>
A system for controlling a bipolar constant current when 
the current is being supplied to an active or reactive element. 

Tracking is extended to either sink or source modes. A switchable 
driven ground state is also provided. An operational amplifier 

buffer senses the voltage amplitude at the junction of the system 
output and active or reactive load element. This relatively low 

impedance output is summed or offset with a regulated voltage. 
This level is again buffered to present a low output impedance and 

series connected with a current limiting resistor.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a current source and sink, and
more particularly to a precision tracking, switchable bipolar
current source/sink with ground clamping (zeroing) at the discrete
circuit level.A variety of constant current devices and circuits are
known in the art. The fundamental textbook constant current
circuit is a constant voltage source series connected to a load
through a high impedance (usually resistive) device. This type of
device has several limitations. It generally requires high
voltages with high power dissipation in the resistor. Also, the
current is not readily programmable or controllable over a range
by means of another voltage. To overcome these problems,
transistors may be used, taking advantage of the base-emitter
voltage (Vbe) match of two or more bipolar transistors (e.g.,
current mirrors, Wilson mirrors and extensions) or the pinch mode
operation of field effect transistors (FET's). These
implementations are programmable and fairly compliant, but are
practical only when used on an integrated circuit where transistor
characteristics can be closely matched.One discrete device solution is the constant current
diode, which is essentially a FET with its gate tied to source or
a pair of cross-coupled FET's. Another very practical, adjustable,
compliant and often-used current sink places the base-emitter
junction of a transistor into the feedback loop of a operational
amplifier. Unfortunately, tight regulation at low current usage
is poorly controlled due to operation near cut-off. Errors are
especially noted with thermal variations.Currently, common current sources and sinks use the
variable impedance of an active semiconductor device in conjunction 
with a fixed voltage to vary the output current
depending on load conditions in an effort to stabilize
the current to some preset value. However, since
semiconductor impedance devices of the type described are
polarity sensitive, these devices may act as current
sources or sinks, but not both.EDN ELECTRICAL DESIGN NEWS, vol. 35, no. 9, April 26,
