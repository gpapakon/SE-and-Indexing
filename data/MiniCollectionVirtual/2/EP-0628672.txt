<ABSTRACT>
An insulating glazing (1) for glass or similar facades composed of glass sheets (4, 5) bonded to each other with a frame (2) inserted between them, the peripheral border seal (7) comprising fixing elements for the application of retention pins (trunnions) (11) and of fixing anchors (10), the gap between the fixing elements and the glass sheets being filled with a sealing material (6). In order to obtain particularly favourable bearing conditions, the fixing elements consist of various U-shaped sectional profiles (8) which are arranged at some distance from the corners of the elements spaced apart and leaving a gap free between the insert frame (2) and the said sectional profiles filled with sealing material.

<CLAIMS>
Insulating glazing for glazed facades having at least two glass sheets
(4, 5) bonded to one another and spaced by a spacer frame (2) and by a

border joint (7) filled with sealing material (6), in which are embedded
fixing elements (8a), which are spaced from one another and separated from

the spacer frame (2), characterized in that the fixing elements (8a) comprise
a hook-like projection, which engages in a front recess (14) of the

external glass sheet (4).
Glazing according to claim 1, characterized in that the fixing elements
have at least one U-profile part (8, 8a).
Glazing according to one of the claims 1 or 2, characterized in that
the fixing elements are located at points remote from the angles.
Glazing according to one of the preceding claims, characterized in that
the fixing elements (8) are separated from the spacer frame (2) by the

sealing material (6).
Use of a glazing according to one of the preceding claims as a building
facade covering, the fixing elements (8a) being linked to facade attachment

means or to a facade-integral structure.
