<ABSTRACT>
A reinforcer 130, 230, 330, 430, 530 of a 
material rich in elasticity is joined to an inside portion 

114, 314, 317 of a stone bar 110, 310 of an L-shaped cross 
section. A groove 115, 315 is formed on one flat surface 

112, 312 as an outside exposed surface. The groove is 
attached with a strip 121, 221, 321 as a coloring material 

which is made of a synthetic resin or synthetic rubber or 
the like of a color different from a color of the stone. 

Thus, a stone finished corner can be given a good strength 
and a user is prevented from slip on steps of stairs.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a corner building stone 
of a bar shape that is provided on a corner of a building 
material. Such corner building materials are used at the 
time of sticking stones like marble or granite to corners 
of stairs, gateposts, building materials, etc. The 
inventive stone is particularly arranged on a corner of a 
building material having a sectional form of an acute, 
right or obtuse angle or a curved sectional form. Figs. 17 and 18 respectively show a conventional 
corner building stone. Fig. 17 is a perspective view of 
the corner building stone. Fig. 18 is a cross-sectional 
view of a corner with the corner building stone stuck 
thereto. In the figures, a bar shaped angular stone 31 has 
substantially a square cross-section with their corners 
chamfered. It finishes a remaining exposed area at a 
corner of a building material after sticking work of plate 
stones 32 to a surface of the building material. The flat 
plate stones 32 are disposed at both sides of the angular 
stone 31 so that they contact respectively with two hidden 
surfaces of the angular stone 31. A work base 40, which is 
an object for sticking the stones, is made of concrete, 
reinforcement, a steel frame, etc. Mortal 41 covers a 
surface of the work base 40 to join the angular stone 31 
and the plate stone 32 to the work base 40, thereby forming 
the corner of the stone stuck building material. However, the angular stone 31 which is used for 
finishing the corner of the building material has a large  
 
portion hidden by the other members, so that such a hidden 
portion is not actually used for decoration and may be 
economised. However, if the thickness of the angular stone 
31 is made smaller, strength of the angular stone 31 is 
made smaller accordingly, thereby possibly causing the 
stone 31 to be broken in transport or a sticking work. Moreover, since the angular stone 31 has 
generally a square cross-section, it has only two sides 
joined to the plate stones 32 or the mortal 41. 
Accordingly, the joining strength between the stone 31 and 
the mortal 40 is relatively small, and, in case of making 
up corners of stairs or the like, the joining strength may 
lessen due to time or mechanical wear, thereby causing the 
angular stone 31 to come off in a short period of time. Furthermore, a border or a corner of a step of 
the stairs is seen as if adjacent two sides are continuous 
without such a border, so that it is hard to distinguish 
the steps, thereby possibly causing a user, e.g. to fail to 
see the
