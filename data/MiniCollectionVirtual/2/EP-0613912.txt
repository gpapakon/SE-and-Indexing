<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a process for
producing ethylene-propylene block copolymers.In polymerization of olefins such as ethylene,
propylene, etc., the performance characteristic of the
polymerization catalyst used therefor has markedly
advanced and the yield of polymer per unit weight of
catalyst component has drastically improved in recent
years. As a consequence, little of the transition metal
catalyst component remains in the resulting polymer and.
the elimination of catalyst residue removal step has
become possible.Processes in use for the polymerization of
these olefins include the slurry polymerization process
conducted in inert hydrocarbon solvents, the bulk
polymerization process conducted in liquified monomers
such as liquified propylene, and the gas phase
polymerization process conducted in a gas phase.For producing block copolymers of ethylene
and propylene, there is known a process which comprises
the first step of polymerizing propylene or propylene
containing a small amount of ethylene to form a
propylene polymer or a propylene-ethylene copolymer and 
the second step of copolymerizing ethylene, or propylene
containing a higher amount of ethylene than in the first
step, with the first step polymer or copolymer.In the above-mentioned process, however,
usually the polymerization velocity in the second step
is higher than in the first step and hence the control
of polymerization ratio in the second step is difficult,
which tends to yield an increased amount of polymer of
low stereospecificity or amorphous polymer in the
second step. Resultantly, the quality of the product
polymer is adversely affected. In particular, in
gas-phase block polymerization process, in which the
second step polymerization is conducted in a gas
phase, lumps of polymer due to sticking of individual
polymer particles to one another tend to form in the
polymerization vessel, build-up of polymer onto the
polymerization vessel tends to take place, and fouling
of piping and sticking of polymer in silos and hoppers
are apt to occur. This not only makes it difficult to
maintain normal operation but adversely affects the
quality of products.In view of such situations of prior art, the
object of the present invention is to provide a process
for producing ethylene-propylene block copolymer which
can maintain a stable polymerization reaction and can
give ethylene-propylene block copolymers excellent in 
appearance, elongation and impact resistance when
molded.This and other objectives will become apparent
from the
