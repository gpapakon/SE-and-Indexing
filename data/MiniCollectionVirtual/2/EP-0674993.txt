<ABSTRACT>
An ink-jet printing system includes a print head which, due to 
mechanical misalignment, produces images having a rotational ϑ-Z 

error if left uncorrected. The printing system has an error 
correction circuit which causes sets of nozzles within the print head 

to fire at slightly different times. The result of this is a printed 
image having one portion offset relative to another portion. The 

relative offset has the visual effect of reducing the ϑ-Z error. 
Several techniques for achieving the time spaced nozzle firing and 

resultant image offset are described. A method for correcting the 
ϑ-Z error in a printed image is also described.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to ink-jet printers, and more particularly, 
to an ink-jet printing system, error correction circuitry, and a method 
for electronic correction of pen misalignment in ink-jet printers. An ink-jet printer is a type of non-impact printer which forms 
characters and other images by controllably spraying drops of ink 
from a print head. The print head ejects liquid ink through multiple 
nozzles in the form of annular drops which travel across a small air 
gap and land on a recording media. The drops are very small as 
ink-jet printers commonly print within a range of 180 to 600 dots 
per inch (dpi). The ink drops dry shortly thereafter to form in 
combination the desired printed images. The print head is commonly ported back and forth over the 
media by a movable carriage. As shown in Fig. 1, print head 10 
is carried by a carriage (not shown) over recording media 12 along 
an x-axis in the "carriage scan direction". The print head has one 
or more vertical arrays of multiple nozzles (e.g., 48 nozzles) which 
simultaneously apply one or more columns of drops as the print head 
is moved over the media. The nozzles are closely aligned according 
to the desired dot-to-dot pitch (e.g., nozzle separation is 1/300th of  
 
an inch for a 300 dpi resolution). In this manner, the print head 
can deposit multiple rows of dots in a single swath in the carriage 
scan direction. Upon completion of a carriage scan, the media 12 is advanced 
along the y-axis in the "media advance direction" by the number of 
rows that the printer is capable of printing in one swath. Printing 
can be unidirectional (which is common for printing graphics) or 
bidirectional (which is common for printing text). Today, most ink-jet print heads are constructed in the form of 
removable and replaceable print head cartridges or pens. In general, 
these pens have inherent mechanical variances due to imprecise 
manufacturing tolerances. Each disposable pen therefore mechanically 
differs from the others. Due to these mechanical variances, each 
pen rests within the printer carriage in a slightly different manner. 
Additionally, the printer carriage has its own set of tolerances which 
introduce another set of mechanical variances. As a result, the print 
characteristics and output patterns are non-uniform among the pens. A primary problem associated with the replaceable pens 
concerns misalignment of the nozzle array due to mechanical rotation 
of the pen about the z-axis. In Fig. 1, the z-axis is shown at the 
origin of the
