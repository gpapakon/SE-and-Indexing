<ABSTRACT>
Carboxylic polymers useful in detergent compositions contain keto structural units incorporated into the polymer backbone. The units may be introduced by means of the compound 2,2'-diphenyl-4-methylene-1,3-dioxolane. The polymers show better biodegradability than the acrylic and acrylic/maleic polymers commonly used in detergent compositions, while the detergency building (calcium binding) is comparable or better.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention is concerned with novel 
polycarboxylate polymers and their use as builders in 
detergent compositions. Polycarboxylate polymers, especially acrylic and 
maleic polymers, are well-known ingredients of detergent 
compositions and provide various benefits. They are 
used, for example, as antiredeposition and 
antiincrustation agents; for detergency building, 
especially in conjunction with water-insoluble 
aluminosilicate builders; and for the structuring of 
detergent powders.  
 Published documents describing the use of acrylic 
and maleic polymers in detergent compositions include 
GB 1 460 893 (Unilever) which discloses polyacrylates; 
EP 25 551B (BASF) which discloses acrylic/maleic 
copolymers; and EP 124 913B (Procter & Gamble) which 
discloses detergent compositions containing combinations 
of polyacrylate and acrylic/maleic copolymer. Although various polycarboxylate polymers have been 
disclosed in the literature as detergent ingredients, 
only polyacrylates and acrylate/maleate copolymers have 
found widespread use in commercial detergent products. 
These polymers, however, are not biodegradable. The present invention is based on the discovery that 
the incorporation of ketone units into the backbone of 
such carboxylic polymers results in improved 
biodegradability without loss of detergency building 
(calcium binding) capacity. These units may be 
introduced into the polymer by means of the compound 
2,2'-diphenyl-4-methylene-1,3-dioxolane or a related 
compound. The polymerisation reaction is controllable, 
may be readily carried out at atmospheric pressure, neat 
or in aqueous or non-aqueous solution, to give high 
yields of biodegradable polymers of good calcium binding 
capacity. US 3 761 412 and US 3 764 586 (Lancelot et al/ 
FMC Corporation) disclose poly-beta-keto acids, useful as 
detergency builders, which are copolymers of carbon 
monoxide gas and maleic anhydride. The polymerisation 
reaction requires high pressure and the presence of an 
organic solvent, and yields are poor (typically 12-24%).  
 EP 281 139A (Mitsubishi) discloses terpolymers of 
ethylene (or other lower olefin), maleic anhydride and 
carbon monoxide which are useful as biodegradable 
detergency builders. The presence of the olefin 
facilitates the polymerisation process and improves 
yield, but the polymerisation process still requires high 
pressure and high temperature, and is not consistently 
reproducible. A different approach is described in JP 02 073 811A 
(Hitachi) which discloses a
