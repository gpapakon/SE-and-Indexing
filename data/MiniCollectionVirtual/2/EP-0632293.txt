<ABSTRACT>
Disclosed is a method for processing geophysical 
data that have been gathered over irregular topography. 

According to the method, a datum is established that 
lies above the highest topographic peak. The data are 

time-shifted from the surface to the datum using a 
replacement velocity that is an extrapolation of the 

underlying formation velocity. The wavefields beneath 
the surface are forwardly modeled using a modeling 

velocity substantially equal to zero. Between the 
surface and the datum, the wavefields are upwardly 

modeled using the replacement velocity.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to seismic data processing.Ordinarily, geophysical exploration of large areas
is most readily conducted by emplacing the
physical-measurement instrumentation on the surface of
the earth. In some land areas, such as the Front Range
of the Rocky Mountains, the topographic relief is a bit
irregular. In other land areas, such as the Alberta
syncline, the surface may be flat prairie but the
underlying Paleozoic surface is severely eroded.
Devonian reefs form a disconformity with respect to the
underlying Silurian formation. At sea, the surface is
usually flat but the sea floor may be topographically
rugged with a substantial velocity contrast across the
water/formation boundary.Unless properly corrected, the raw geophysical
measurements are distorted by the irregular topography
of the earth at the surface or by raypath bending that
occurs at the formation interfaces subsurface. That
is, the quantitative geophysical measurements tend to
display the approximate topography of the irregular
interface instead of the desired topography of the
underlying target formation.By way of example but not by way of limitation,
this disclosure will be narrated in terms of seismic
exploration geophysics but the basic concepts apply
equally well to other geophysical studies such as
potential field or electromagnetic measurements.As is well known in seismic surveying a plurality
of transducers are distributed over the surface of an
area under study. A separate source, or a certain
transducer selected as a source, is used for generating
an acoustic wavefield while the remaining transducers 
serve as receivers of the acoustic waves after
reflection from subsurface formations. The traveltime
from the source to each of the respective receivers,
corrected for non-vertical raypaths and multiplied by
half the average earth velocity, is a measure of the
distance between the receiver and the reflecting
interface. If the reflecting interface is flat and the
surface is irregular, the travel time will vary in
proportion to the surface elevation, producing an
incorrect image.Traditionally, to correct for surface topography,
a horizontal datum is established, usually at an
elevation above the tallest topographic feature. The
seismic travel times are extrapolated upwards from the
surface to the datum by applying a static time
correction equal to the vertical distance between
surface and datum divided by one-half of a preselected
replacement velocity. The replacement velocity may be
selected as an extension of the
