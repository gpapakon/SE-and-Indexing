<ABSTRACT>
Method and apparatus for diagnosing a cushioning device (44) 
of a press, wherein an optimum range of a blank-holding 

force acting on a pressure member (28) through a cushion 
platen (26), balancing hydraulic cylinders (30) and cushion 

pins (22) is determined on the basis of a rate of change of 
the detected hydraulic pressure in the hydraulic cylinders 

with a change of the blank-holding force, or on the basis of 
the detected blank-holding force and hydraulic pressure and 

according to a predetermined formula formulated on the basis 
of specifications of the cushioning device. Where the rate 

of change of the detected hydraulic pressure is used for 
diagnosing the cushioning device, the optimum range of the 

blank-holding force is determined if the rate of change of 
the hydraulic pressure with the blank-holding force is 

substantially constant, or is substantially equal to a 
reference value determined on the basis of the 

specifications of the cushioning device.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method of and an apparatus
for diagnosing
a cushioning device for even distribution of a blank-holding
force to a blank to be processed on a press according to
the preambles of claims 1 and 13 respectively. More
particularly, the present invention is concerned with a
method and an apparatus that permits easy and accurate
diagnosis on a range of the blank-holding force within which
the blank-holding force is substantially evenly distributed
on the blank.A press has a slide with an upper die attached
thereto, which is lowered toward a lower die to perform a
pressing operation on a blank or workpiece while the blank
is held by and between the upper die and a pressure member.
For holding the blank during a pressing cycle, there is
known a cushioning device which includes (a) a cushion
platen or pad which receives a blank-holding force
(cushioning force) produced by suitable force generating
means, (b) a plurality of balancing hydraulic cylinders
disposed on the cushion platen and having respective fluid
chambers which communicate with each other, and (c) a
plurality of cushion pins linked at their lower ends with 
the respective hydraulic cylinders and supporting at their
upper ends the pressure member, so that the blank-holding
force produced by the force generating means is applied to
the pressure member through the cushion platen, hydraulic
cylinders and cushion pins. The mutually communicating
hydraulic cylinders function to assure substantially even
distribution of the blank-holding force on the cushion pins,
that is, substantially even distribution of the
blank-holding force on the pressure member.An example of such cushioning device is disclosed
in laid-open Publication No. 1-60721 (published in 1989) of
unexamined Japanese Utility Model Application. This
cushioning device is adapted to apply the blank-holding
force to the pressure member such that the blank-holding
force acts on the pressure member substantially evenly over
the entire surface area of the pressure member to thereby
assure substantially uniform distribution of the surface
pressure of the pressure member with respect to the blank,
for permitting pressing cycles to be performed with high
stability of accuracy, irrespective of a length variation or
difference of the cushion pins, tilting of the cushion
platen with respect to the nominal plane, and other
undesirable fluctuating factors of the cushioning device.For substantially even distribution of the
blank-holding force on the pressure member, it is
