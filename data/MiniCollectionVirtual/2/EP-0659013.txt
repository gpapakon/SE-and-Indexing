<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to scanning an object. Light sources used in scanning objects vary in brightness, color, 
and dispersion over time. These variations include rapid flutters of 
plasma discharge, path or filament oscillation, responses to 
environmental changes such as temperature, and aging of the light source 
and light sensor. When these light variations occur during a scan, such 
as in a line scanning device, waves are generated across the image. In 
addition, longer term variations result in inefficient use of dynamic 
capture range, drift and image quality. Prior art scanners typically require the light source to be stable 
to avoid these problems. This results in expensive lamps and power 
supplies for expensive scanners and degraded images when economics 
require using less expensive lamps and power supplies. Prior art methods 
of stabilizing lamps include using more rigid filaments, preheating gas 
discharge bulbs for 10 minutes before a scan would begin, using 
temperature control ovens, using very stable power supplies, using 
multiple photocells, using feedback signals through the power supply, 
carefully designing lamps to limit plasma turbulence, and frequently 
recalibrating the equipment to compensate for aging. In accordance with the present invention, there is now provided an 
apparatus for generating an image from an object comprising: means for 
using a first portion of a light sensor to generate image data of an 
object; means for using a second portion of the light sensor to generate 
illumination data of an illumination source concurrently with the 
generation of image data by the first portion of the light sensor; and 
means for correcting the generated image data using the concurrently 
generated illumination data. Viewing the present invention from another aspect, there is now 
provided a method for generating an image from an object comprising the 
steps of: using a first portion of a light sensor to generate image data 
of an object; using a second portion of the light sensor to generate 
illumination data of an illumination source concurrently with the 
generation of image data by the first portion of the light sensor; and 
correcting the generated image data using the concurrently generated 
illumination data.  The present invention also extends to a data processing system for 
generating an image from an object comprising: (a) a scanner including: 
i) means for using an first portion of a light sensor to generate image 
data of an object; and ii) means for using a
