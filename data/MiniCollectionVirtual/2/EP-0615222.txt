<ABSTRACT>
Successive pixels representing video data in 
successive lines in a raster scan are buffered. Each of the 

lines has a sync pulse defining the line beginning. A phase 
adjustment is determined between the sync pulse, preferably at 

a particular level in the sync pulse, and an adjacent one of 
system adjacent clock signals at a particular frequency. The 

actual or expected phase adjustment between the pixels at the 
end of each line is also determined. The difference between 

the phase adjustments at the beginning and end of each line is 
then determined. Progressive adjustments are made in the 

phase of each successive pixel in the line relative to the 
system clock signals in accordance with the number of system 

clock signals in the line and the determined difference in the 
phase adjustment between the line beginning and end. In this 

way, the pixels of video data are synchronized with the system 
clock signals. When the actual phase adjustment relative to 

the system clock signals is determined at the end of each 
line, the difference in the phase adjustments at the beginning 

and end of such line is determined from the phase adjustment 
for such line and the phase adjustment stored for the previous 

line. When the expected phase adjustment is provided for the 
end of each line, this estimated value is altered for each 

line by an amount equal to the actual phase adjustment at the 

beginning of such line and the estimated phase adjustment at 
the end of such line.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to apparatus for
synchronizing incoming video data in the form of pixels in
successive lines in a raster scan to coincide with successive
system clock signals at a particular frequency. The invention
is especially adapted to be used in a graphics system.Video data in the form of successive pixels in each
line of a raster scan is often provided for use in a graphics
system. For example, graphics data may be displayed on the
face of a video monitor and the video may be displayed on a
window on the face of this video monitor. The pixels are
often presented from an external source such as from a tape at
a frequency different from the clock in the graphics system in
which the video data is to be displayed. Furthermore, the
frequency of the video data sometimes varies somewhat. This
results from the fact that the lengths of the successive lines
of the pixels tend to vary somewhat.From EP-A2-096 628 it is known to use a signal display for
overlaying or separately displaying computer generated
graphics/text and video data. It is described to lock the
synchronisation of an apparatus for combining a video signal
with graphics and text from a computer to the timing of the
video image source when video data is displayed. US 5 027 212 relates to a
system for combining video signals and graphic signals on a
common display. Both signals are combined using the
synchronisation from the computer graphics generator. To
achieve conversion of the video input signal to a signal
synchronised to the computer graphics generator, field/frame
stores are used which have different video data input and
output rates wherein the input rate corresponds to the video
clock rate and the read-out of the video data corresponds to
the clock rate generated by the computer.Conventionally, the frequency of the system clock
signals has been varied to attempt to have this frequency
conform to the frequency at which the pixels in the'video data
are presented. This has presented complications. For
example, since the frequency of the video data is not
constant, the frequency of the system clock signals tends to
vary with time. Furthermore, since the operation of the
system is tied to the frequency of the system clock signals,
variations in the frequency of the system clock signals tends
to produce complications in the operation of the system.In addition to the horizontal sync signal at the
beginning of each line, there is also a burst of sinusoidal
signals at a sub-carrier frequency. In the NTSC system used 
in the United
