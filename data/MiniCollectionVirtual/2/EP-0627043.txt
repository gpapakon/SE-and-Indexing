Valve actuating mechanism for an internal combustion 
engine, comprising at least two intake valves (E) to 

each cylinder, which are actuated by cams on a 
camshaft (5) via first and second valve levers (6 and 

9 respectively), the first valve levers (6) being 
adapted to swivel about a common shaft and 

respectively cooperating with an intake valve (E) and 
its own first cam (2, 3, 4) for a first engine speed 

range, and the second valve levers (9) being adapted 
to swivel about a common shaft and cooperating with 

their own second cams (8) for a second engine speed 
range, and comprising coupling means (13; 24) between 

the first and second valve levers in order to couple 
the latter with one another in the second engine 

speed range and to decouple them from one another in 
the first engine speed range, characterised in that 


there are three intake valves (E) and three first 
valve levers to each cylinder 
associated with the three first valve levers are 
two second valve levers (9) which are each arranged 

between two neighbouring first valve levers 
the two second cams (8) with which the two second 
valve levers (9) cooperate are identical. 
Valve actuating mechanism according to claim 1, 
characterised in that the longitudinal centre axes 

(6a and 21 respectively) of each first valve lever 
(6) and of the valve (E) actuated thereby are 

situated in a common plane. 
Valve actuating mechanism according to claim 1 or 2, 
characterised in that the two second valve levers (9)  

 
are joined rigidly to one another or are made in one 

piece. 
Valve actuating mechanism according to any of claims 
1 to 3, characterised in that the second valve levers 

(9) are swivel-mounted on the common (7) shaft of the 
first valve levers (6). 
Valve actuating mechanism according to any of claims 
1 to 4, characterised in that the cams (2, 3, 4) 

actuating the first valve levers (6) have different 
cam contours. 
Valve actuating mechanism according to claim 5, 
characterised in that at least one of the cams has a 

no-stroke contour. 
Valve actuating mechanism according to any of claims 
1 to 6, characterised in that the valve axes (21) of 

the intake valves (E) intersect the rotational axis 
(D) of the camshaft (5) or cross a short distance 

therefrom. 
Valve actuating mechanism according to claim 3, 
characterised in that the free ends of the two second 

valve levers (9) are joined to one another by a cross 
member (10) situated in front of and a short distance 

from the free ends of the first valve levers (6), 
that in the first valve levers (6) and in the cross 

member (10) are provided bores (11 and 12, 

respectively) which are in alignment with one another 
when the valves are shut, that the bores (11) in the 

first valve levers (6) receive pistons (13) which are 
adapted to be displaced by oil pressure against the 

force of a spring (15) into the bores (12) in the 
cross member (10), that the springs (15) are arranged 

in the bores (11) in the first valve levers (6) and  
 

rest on the one hand against a pipe (17) connected to 
the piston (13) and on the other hand against an 

insert (16) fixed in the bore and penetrated by the 
pipe (17), and that in the shaft (7) of the first 

valve levers (6) there is provided an oil feeder duct 
(14) which communicates with the bores (11) in the 

first valve levers (6). 
Valve actuating mechanism according to claim 1 or 2, 
characterised in that the first and the second valve 

levers (6, 9) incorporate bores (22, 23) which extend 
parallel to their rotational axes and which extend 

coaxially when the valves are shut, that a controller 
barrel (24) is provided which extends through all the 

bores and is mounted in the bores (23) of the second 
valve levers (9) and in the vicinity of the bores 

(22) in the first valve levers (6) incorporates cut-outs 
(25), that the bores (22) in the first valve 

levers (6) are open towards the bottom across a subregion 
(24), and that the controller barrel (24) is 

adapted to rotate between a first position in which 
it is able to exit from the bores (22) in the first 

valve levers (6) thanks to the cut-outs (25), and a 
second position in which it couples together the 

first and the second valve levers. 
Valve actuating mechanism according to claim 9, 
characterised in that the ends of the controller 

barrel (24) incorporate eccentric continuations (28) 
with respect to the longitudinal centre axis of the 

controller barrel, 

that swivel-mounted on the ends of the common rotary 
shaft (7) are rings (30) which respectively 

incorporate a continuation with a slot (29) into 
which engages an eccentric continuation (28) of the 

controller barrel (24), and  
 
that the rings (30) are held by a spring (36) in a 
first position which corresponds to the first 

position of the controller barrel (24), and are 
adapted to be swung by at least one hydraulic piston 

(34) against the spring force into a second position 
in which the controller barrel (24) finds itself in 

its second position. 
Valve actuating mechanism according to claim 10, 
characterised in that the two rings (30) are joined 

to one another by a crosspiece (31) and that in each 
of the two second valve levers (9) there is provided 

a hydraulic piston (34) which operates on the 
crosspiece and is adapted to be activated by a 

pressure medium which can be supplied along a 
longitudinal duct (14) in the common shaft (7) in 

dependence on operating parameters of the internal 
combustion engine. 
Valve actuating mechanism according to claim 10, 
characterised in that the second valve levers (9) are 

swivel-mounted on a fixed shaft (7) and the first 
valve levers (6) on a shaft (40) which passes through 

the second valve levers and is parallel to the fixed 
shaft.
