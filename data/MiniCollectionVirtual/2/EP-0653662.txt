<ABSTRACT>
An optical isolator (10) comprises a non-reciprocal rotator (12) disposed 
between a pair birefringent wedges, an input wedge (14) and an output wedge (16). 

In order to reduce walk-off between the ordinary and extraordinary rays at the output 
of the isolator in one embodiment, the input signal (11') is made incident on the 

input wedge at an angle (ϑ
c
) above the normal to wedge. At a particular angle 
related to various parameters of the isolator the relative walk-off can be reduced to 

essentially zero. In another embodiment, the input angle and various isolator 
parameters are mutually adapted so that the ordinary and extraordinary rays intersect 

within the isolator.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an optical isolator designed to reduce 
the displacement (walk-off) between the ordinary and extraordinary rays transmitted 
through the isolator. Reflections in optical systems often generate noise and optical feedback 
which may degrade the performance of various system components, particularly 
signal sources such as semiconductor lasers and fiber amplifiers. Therefore, the 
ability to optically isolate lasers and other sensitive components from these 
reflections is often critical to the performance of the system. In general, a 
conventional optical isolator comprises a non-reciprocal rotator (e.g., 45° Faraday 
rotator encased within a bias magnet) disposed between a pair of polarization 
selectors (e.g., linear polarizers, birefringent plates, or birefringent wedges). Input 
signals passing through the isolator in the transmitting, forward direction are 
essentially fully coupled through the polarization selector and Faraday rotator to the 
output device (e.g., fiber). However, the polarization of reflected signals passing 
through the isolator in the reflecting, reverse direction is rotated such that essentially 
none of the reflections are coupled back into the signal source. In many important system applications, in particular those where the 
polarization of the signals cannot be fully controlled throughout the system (e.g., in 
most fiber optic systems), it is important that the isolator operate effectively 
regardless of the polarization state of the signal. A common isolator design which addresses this problem includes a 
Faraday rotator slab disposed between a pair of birefringent wedges. See, for 
example, W. Emkey et al.. Proc.OFC, Abstract THF2 (1989). The input signal is 
incident on the oblique surface of the input wedge at essentially the wedge angle. 
(For comparison purposes, we note that this incident angle is measured below the 
normal to the oblique surface; that is, from the normal toward the thicker end of the 
wedge.) Although this design may be polarization independent under certain 
conditions, it does exhibit a phenomenon called relative walk-off. That is, the input 
signal splits into ordinary and extraordinary rays which are displaced from one 
another at the isolator output. When the output is lensed into an aperture (e.g., a 
fiber core), the power coupled into the fiber from each ray can be different, and the 
total coupled power is less than that possible if the relative walk-off did not occur.  Thus, a need remains in the optical
