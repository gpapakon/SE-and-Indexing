<ABSTRACT>
In plant for the production and processing of an aromatic carboxylic acid such as terephthalic acid, at least some of the plant components (especially those exposed to an acidic reaction medium at elevated temperatures and pressures in excess of 180  DEG C and 8 bara respectively) are fabricated from duplex stainless steels and the conditions under which such plant components are exposed to the reaction medium are controlled to maintain a low corrosion rate.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to the oxidation of substituted aromatic
compounds to aromatic carboxylic acids using a catalyst which
comprises bromine or a bromine-containing compound. The invention has
particular application in the production of terephthalic acid.Aromatic carboxylic acids such as terephthalic acid have
commonly been produced by the oxidation of substituted aromatic
compounds such as p-xylene by means of molecular oxygen in a lower
aliphatic monocarboxylic acid solvent (preferably having from 2 to 8,
and more preferably from 2 to 6, carbon atoms, for example acetic
acid) and in the presence of a catalyst comprising one or more heavy
metal compounds and bromine or a bromine-containing compound.It is widely recognised that the chemicals involved in this
chemical reaction are particularly corrosive especially under the
conditions of temperature and pressure usually employed to realise
high yields. This necessarily leads to the extensive use of suitable
corrosion resistant materials for construction of the reactor vessel
and associated items of plant. Accordingly, expensive titanium and
titanium alloys have figured extensively as construction materials in
plant for effecting oxidation of for example p-xylene to terephthalic
acid especially in circumstances where the oxidation reaction is
carried out using a lower aliphatic monocarboxylic acid solvent in
the presence of bromine or a bromine-containing compound. Thus, to
quote from US-A-4330676 (Column 4, lines 47 to 54): "Where the
catalyst contains a bromide a material must be used capable of
withstanding the resulting highly corrosive reaction mixture, for
example titanium, but in the absence of bromide less expensive
materials such as stainless steels are suitable".With a view to allowing the use of less expensive materials of
construction such as stainless steels, proposals have been made from
time to time involving modification of the reaction conditions, ie
the materials employed in the oxidation reaction and/or parameters
such as temperature and pressure under which the oxidation reaction
is carried out. For instance, US-A-4278810 and GB-A-2094800 disclose
processes for the production of terephthalic acid in which bromine is
deliberately excluded from the oxidation reaction, water is used as a
substitute for acetic acid and the reaction is carried out under
relatively low temperature conditions. The Japanese document JP-53071026 discloses the use of duplex stainless steel SUS 329J,
which is not a nitrogen containing duplex stainless steel,
