<ABSTRACT>
In the method proposed, grooves (2, 3) which are connected to each other are machined in a base mould (7), the minimum width of the grooves corresponding to the "mesh size" (a) and the maximum width of the grooves corresponding to the maximum width of the lands (12) of the stencil carrier. The grooves (2, 3) are filled with liquid plastic which is allowed to cure while still in the grooves (2, 3) and then separated from the mould (7). This method makes it possible to produce plane stencil carriers simply, and is less complicated than prior art methods.

Process for producing a flexible and dimensionally stable carrier (11) 
for silk screen printing, whereby a base mould (1,7) made from a 

dimensionally stable material is provided with interconnected grooves 
(2,3) on the surface (15), whose inner width matches that of the required 

"mesh width" (a) and their maximum width (c) is that of the required 
bridge width (b) of the stencil carrier (11), the grooves (2,3) on this base 

mould (1,7) are at least partly filled with a liquid, curable polymer, the 
polymer is cured whilst still in the grooves (2,3) and then removed from 

the base mould (1,7), further characterised in that a rotatable cylinder (7) 
is used as a base mould, on which the grooves (2,3) run in the direction 

of the circumference and along the length of the cylinder (7). 
Process according to claim 1, further characterised in that at least the 
grooves (2) in the direction of the circumference are equipped with 

reinforcements (9) made from, as far as possible, non-stretch threads or 
wires. 
Process according to claim 2, further characterised in that the 
reinforcement (9) is laid in the grooves (2,3) filled with liquid pol
ymer. 
Process according to claims 1 to 3, further characterised in that the 
thickness (d) of the stencil carrier (11) is regulated by varying the solid 

content of the liquid polymer. 
Process according to claims 1 to 4, further characterised in that the 
grooves (2,3), at least in one direction, are provided with a conically 

widened cross-section. 
Process according to claim 5, further characterised in that the grooves 
(2,3) are provided with a V-shaped cross-section.  

 
Process according to claims 1 to 6, further characterised in that the 
grooves (2,3) are provided with an asymmetrical cross-section. 
Process according to claims 1 to 7, further characterised in that the 
grooves (2) in the direction of the circumference differ from those (3) 

along the length of the cylinder (7) in terms of division, shape and depth. 
A base mould for carrying out the process according to one of the 
previous claims, further characterised in that it is a cylinder (7) with a 

metal casing surface (15) which is provided with grooves (2,3) running in 
the direction of the circumference and along the length of the cylinder 

(7). 
A base mould according to claim 9, further characterised in that the 
edge areas on at least two opposite sides have a stepped depression 

(10). 
A base mould according to claim 10, further characterised in that a 
reinforcement (9) is laid in the depression (10). 
A stencil carrier for silk screen printing made according to the 
process in at least one of the claims 1 to 8.
