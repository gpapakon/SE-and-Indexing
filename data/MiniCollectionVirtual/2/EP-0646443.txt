<ABSTRACT>
A device for making undercut cavities in articles made of clay, in particular in roof tiles, has shaping slides with free shaping ends which have the negative contour of the cavities to be made and which, by means of a drive, can be displaced into a shaping position for making the cavities in the soft clay mass and can be drawn back therefrom into a rest position again.

A device for forming cavities in articles of clay, 
more particularly in roof tiles, comprising at least 

one forming slide (27, 29, 31; 28, 30, 32) having a 
free forming end (29 - 32) having the negative contour 

of the required cavity, the forming slide being movable 
with non-positive guidance into a forming position for 

forming the cavities in the soft clay material, the 
movement being provided by means of a cam (12) which is 

adapted to be driven in rotation about a spindle (16) 
fixed to the device, and withdrawable therefrom back 

into a position of rest, characterised in that the cam 
(12) is articulated on the free end of the piston rod 

(6) of a fluid cylinder (2) so as to be pivotable by 
way of a lever (14). 
A device according to claim 1, characterised in 
that the cam (12) has two diametrically opposite 

camming surfaces (24, 26) which between them form the 
maximum diameter of the cam and, when actuated, spread 

opposite forming slides apart from one another. 
A device according to claim 2, characterised in 
that two parallel fluid cylinders (2) are arranged with 

their piston rods (6) disposed in opposition to one 
another, said piston rods each acting on two separate 

cams (12) for synchronous actuation of pairs of 
opposite forming slides. 
A device according to claim 3, characterised in 
that each forming slide has in each case two forming 

ends (29, 31; 30, 32) at the opposite ends of a slide 
rod (27, 28) on which the two cams (12) act.  

 
A device according to any one of claims 1 to 4, 
characterised in that the resetting device (34, 36) is 

provided for resetting the or each forming slide after 
the completed forming operation. 
A device according to claim 5, characterised in 
that the resetting device is formed by at least one 

spring. 
A device according to claim 5 or 6, characterised 
in that the resetting device comprises two tension 

springs (34, 36) which act on two parallel slide rods 
(28, 28). 
A device according to any one of claims 1 to 7, 
characterised in that it is adapted to be lowered into 

an upwardly open trough (52) of a roof tile (50) to 
accommodate a solar cell panel and in that the cavities 

(54, 56) are adapted to be formed in opposite side 
walls of the trough for mounting the solar cell panel. 
A device according to any one of claims 1 to 8, 
characterised in that it is integrated into a lifting 

and de-burring device with a suction plate (1) for a 
roof tile (50).
