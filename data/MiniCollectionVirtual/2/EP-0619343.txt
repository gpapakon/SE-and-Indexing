<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention concerns a process for the coating
of metal pipes with polyolefin materials.Metal pipes usually made of steel and coated with plastic
materials are widely used for the construction of pipe-lines
destined for the conveyance of fluid materials, such as oil,
natural gases or water, even for long distances.Said pipe-lines must be able to withstand the most varied
environmental conditions, and in some cases, the high
temperatures which are maintained in the vicinity of pumping
stations, for example, or may be typical of certain fluids
which are extracted directly from the subsoil. Therefore the
coatings must be carefully selected in order to obtain high
levels of corrosion resistance. Some types of coatings made
with polyolefin materials have been found to be particularly
suited for this purpose.Moreover, in order not to create weak points in the line
(at the welded points between the pipes, for example) one must
be able to repair the damaged or removed portions of the above
mentioned coating in such a way as to obtain mechanical
properties which are as similar as possible to those of the
original coating.EP-A-0 444 446
teaches
that the removed or damaged portions of polyolefin material
coatings of metal pipes can be efficiently repaired by using
patches or strips of polypropylene materials which are fastened 
to the pipes by way of specific adhesive polymer compositions.
However, the above mentioned polypropylene materials based on
polymers which are not crosslinked are not suited for coating
large segments of metal pipes, and require accurate application
procedures. In particular, given the low viscoelasticity of
the above polymers in the molten state, their heating step,
which is protracted until the softening or melting point is
reached in order to obtain optimal adhesion, must be carried
out in such a way as to avoid nonhomogeneity and/or lacerations
in the final coating.For this purpose heat sources are used which allow one to
obtain homogeneous heat and avoid the use of flame in direct
contact with the polymer, such as, for example, radiant panels,
electric heating coils, induction ovens or infra-red lights.The above mentioned devices, moreover, allow one to obtain
good heat diffusion inside the layer of the polyolefin coating.
However, said devices are relatively complex and expensive, and
are not always readily available at the sites where the pipes
are being laid.This invention provides a new process for coating metal
pipes based on the use of certain partially crosslinked
