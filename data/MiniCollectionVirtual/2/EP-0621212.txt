<ABSTRACT>
A container used for transporting dry bulk 
product which can be loaded and unloaded using a 

pneumatic mechanism and without need for tipping 
the container, comprising a plurality of hoppers, 

an external frame, a unique method of connecting 
the hoppers to the frame using skirt rings at the 

ends of the frame and side sills, and internal 
stiffeners between the hoppers, all of which act to 

provide sufficient strength to the container.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates in general to shipping 
containers used to transport flowable dry bulk 
goods. In order to economically transport dry bulk 
goods, it is necessary to use a sufficiently large 
container that can be transported by a variety of 
means, including by truck, sea or rail, and the 
container must be easily loaded and unloaded using 
commonly available apparatus. It is known in the 
art to use hoppers, tanks and similar containers 
for transporting both dry goods and liquid product. 
However, such known containers suffer from design 
flaws which make them difficult and/or uneconomical 
to use. Specifically, the dry goods containers 
presently on the market require that the container 
be tipped to unload the product. Such a design is 
undesirable because of the problems inherent in 
tipping such a large device. Furthermore, in order to be commercially 
acceptable, such a freight container must be 
designed and built to internationally recognized 
standards such as those issued by the United 
Nations, the International Standards Organization  
 
(ISO) and the Association of American Railroads 
(AAR). These organizations promulgate standards 
for such containers relating to all facets of 
handling and carriage, including, among other 
things, strength, size, weight and materials used 
in the construction of the container. Applicable 
standards for containers such as the one disclosed 
herein include the ISO 1496/IV, AAR M-930, the 
United Nations' Council for Safe Containers (CSC) 
and Customs/TIR. In order to withstand the testing dictated by 
the above standards to simulate actual operation of 
the container, such containers require additional 
support. Many containers known in the prior art 
use internal stiffener rings and similar structural 
support members. However, these designs create 
internal cavities or pockets which can trap product 
and which reduce the internal size of the 
container. Other designs use an internal frame for 
additional support. However, an internal frame 
reduces the internal volume in the container and 
thus makes the container less efficient.  
 
Therefore, it is preferred to use an external frame 
with such containers. Shipping containers which are cylindrical in 
shape and which are commonly used with liquid 
product are unacceptable for use with dry product 
because the cylindrical shape does not allow a 
sufficient amount of cubic space within the frame. Other currently available containers on the 
market use heavier, non-corrosion resistant 
materials

<CLAIMS>
A container for storing and transporting dry 
bulk product, comprising 


a) a vessel for holding and storing said dry 
product, said vessel having a top, bottom and 

plurality of sides; 
b) means for unloading said product from the 
bottom of said vessel; and 
c) an external frame secured to said vessel, 
wherein said frame is comprised of 


i) a first end piece and a second end 
piece located opposite of said first end 

piece, each said end piece having a top 
portion, a bottom portion and at least a 

first and second side portions connecting 
said top portion to said bottom portion; 
ii) a plurality of longitudinal members 
connecting said end pieces; 
iii) at least one longitudinal member 
having a sill securely connected thereto, 

and said sill being securely connected to 
one of said sides of said vessel; and 
iv) an attaching means securely fastened 
to each of said end pieces and to a 

portion of said vessel. 
A container as set forth in Claim 1, wherein 
said vessel is composed of a plurality of hoppers 

joined to one another, each said hopper having a 
generally trapezoidal shape and an opening disposed 

towards the bottom of said vessel, and a beam 
disposed between said hoppers and extending from 

one side of said vessel to the opposite side of 
said vessel. 
A container as set forth in Claim 2 further 
comprising an arch located between each said hopper 

on the internal portion of said vessel and secured 
to said beam between said hoppers. 
A container as set forth in Claim 1, wherein 
said vessel is composed of stainless steel. 
A container as set forth in Claim 1, wherein 
said vessel is composed of aluminum. 
A container for storing and transporting dry 
bulk product, comprising 


a) a vessel for holding and storing said dry 
product, said vessel having a top, bottom and 

plurality of sides; 
b) means for unloading said product from the 
bottom of said vessel using a pneumatic 

mechanism; and 
c) an external frame secured to said vessel, 
wherein said frame is comprised of 


i) a first end piece and a second end 
piece located opposite of said first end 

piece, each said end piece having a top 
horizontal member and a bottom horizontal 

member and at least a first and second 
vertical member connecting said top 

member to said bottom member; 
ii) a plurality of first longitudinal 
members connecting said end pieces near 

the top thereof; 
iii) a plurality of second longitudinal 
members connecting said end pieces near 

the bottom thereof; 
iv) at least one first center 
longitudinal member connecting said first 

vertical member of said first end piece 
to said first vertical member of said 

second end piece, and a first sill 
securely connected to said first center 

longitudinal member and to one of said 
sides of said vessel; 
v) at least one second center 
longitudinal member connecting said 

second vertical member of said first end 
piece to said second vertical member of 

said second end piece, and a second sill 
securely connected to said second center 

longitudinal member and to one of said 
sides of said vessel; 
vi) a first skirt ring securely fastened 
to said first end piece and to a portion 

of said vessel; 
vii) a second skirt ring securely
