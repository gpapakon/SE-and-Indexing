<ABSTRACT>
A multi-mode position location method detects the location 
of movable detection devices (31') which are attached to movable 

carriers (31) in a simulated battlefield. The multi-mode position 
location method employs three modes of position location of the 

detection devices. The first mode is a Global Positioning System 
(GPS) differentially corrected position (72) of the detection device 

(31'). The second mode is a multilateration determined position 
(84) of the detection device. The third mode is an autonomously 

determined GPS position (78) of the detection device. The 
autonomously determined position (78) is determined without any 

differential GPS corrections. The most accurately determined 
position of the detection device (31') may be used for area weapons 

effects simulation (10) and carrier tracking by transmitting the 
carrier's position to a master control station (11).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention pertains to the location of detection 
device carriers within a bounded area and more particularly to a 
multi-mode position location method for providing accurate 
positions of detection devices within a simulated battlefield. Currently, to locate troops and vehicles within a simulated 
battlefield, multilateration systems exist to provide such 
information. Multilateration systems provide a certain level of 
accuracy in their position determination. However, since such 
systems are highly dependent upon the moving vehicles or soldiers 
to receive signals from stationary relays or transmitters, uneven 
terrain and foliage may interfere with the ability for position 
location determination by the moving of troops and vehicles. Global Positioning System (GPS) is able to provide highly 
accurate position location determination. However, modes of high 
resolution GPS position determination are or may be unavailable 
for general usage. The Department of Defense intentionally 
"dithers" the signals transmitted by GPS satellites since 
extremely accurate position location may be used for illegal 
purposes. Further, the GPS system may be unavailable sometimes for 
use due to satellite failure. In addition, the transmission relays of 
multilateration systems may fail also. Therefore, in order to avoid the high cost of amassed troops 
and vehicles which are unable to perform in "war game" exercises, 
a highly reliable and accurate position location system would be 
advantageous.  In accordance with the present invention, a novel multi-mode 
position location method for locating detection devices first 
determines by a processor whether the Global Positioning System 
(GPS) position is valid for a particular detection device. Next, if 
the GPS position of the detection device is valid, the processor 
provides a differentially corrected GPS position of the detection 
device to a master control station. Then, if the Global Positioning System position of the 
detection device is not valid, the processor determines whether a 
multilateration system position of the detection device is valid. If 
the multilateration system position of the detection device is 
valid, the processor provides this position to the master control 
station in place of the Global Positioning System position. FIG. 1 is multi-mode position location system in accordance 
with the present invention. FIG. 2 is a block diagram of a vehicle detection device in
