<ABSTRACT>
An arrangement for securing nibless tiles on a roof provides spaced-apart pegs (14, 16) formed integrally with a mounting (2) of moulded plastic adapted for use with a conventional wooden batten (8) or in a modified arrangement spaced-apart pegs (14a, 16a) are integrally moulded with a plastics batten (30). In use, complementary apertures of tiles fixed on a roof are force fit on the pegs (14, 16 or 14a, 16a) whereby the tiles are positively affixed to the roof.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention is concerned with improvements in or relating to 
a roof structure and tile mountings included therein, in particular 
a roof structure according to the preamble of claim 1. Conventionally, concrete and clay roof tiles have adequate 
provision for enabling the hanging of the tiles on a roof. For 
example, such tiles are provided with hanging nibs which, in 
use, are hung on the battens of the roof structure. Some plain tiles as herein defined are not provided with conventional 
hanging nibs and are usually fastened to the battens 
using nails for which purpose one or more apertures are normally 
provided, i.e. pre-punched, through headlap portions of the 
tiles. It will be readily appreciated that while the hanging 
nibs of conventional tiles enable the accurate positioning 
lengthwise of a roof of such tiles, uniformity in laying tiles 
without a hanging nib is a hit-and-miss affair. The disclosure of FR-A-2461072 relates 
to an arrangement for securing corrugated panels or shakes to 
a roof in overlapping relationship with the arrangement 
comprising a preformed metal batten adapted in use to accommodate 
an upper end portion of an associated panel or shake. 
Spiked portions formed integrally with said battens and 
upstanding therefrom pierce like panels or shakes extending in 
overlapping relationship to secure said panels or shakes on a 
roof. An arrangement as proposed in 
FR-A-2461072 cannot be adapted for use with clay or concrete tiles 
because the batten spikes would damage the tiles rather than 
pierce them. FR-A-1 382 637 discloses a roof structure in which plastic 
tiles are provided with perforated ribs. Pegs extending parallel to 
the plane of the roof structure are provided on tile battens to engage 
the perforations in a push-fit relationship. Such an arrangement is 
not suitable for clay and concrete tiles.  
 The present invention seeks to overcome or at least mitigate the 
shortcomings met hitherto in hanging concrete or clay tiles 
without hanging nibs or equivalent provision. Thus, the present 
invention conveniently provides a roof structure comprising a 
mounting for a tile, wherein the mounting comprises tile 
engaging means upstanding from tile battens and provided by 
spaced-apart pegs, said pegs being received, 
in use, in a push-fit relationship within associated apertures 
formed in a tile mounted on said mounting, characterised in that 
said pegs extend normally, or substantially so, to the plane of 
the roof structure. Conveniently, the spaced-apart pegs are

<CLAIMS>
A roof structure comprising a mounting (2) for a tile, wherein 
the mounting comprises tile engaging means upstanding from 

tile battens (8,30) and provided by spaced-apart pegs (14,16,14a,16a), said pegs being received, in use, in a 
push-fit relationship within associated apertures formed 

in a tile mounted on said mounting, characterised in that said 
pegs (14,16,14',16') extend normally, or substantially so, to the 

plane of the roof structure. 
A roof structure according to Claim 1 wherein the spaced-apart 
pegs (14,16) are provided on a support mounted on a conventional 

wooden tile batten (8). 
A roof structure according to either one of Claims 1 and 
2 wherein the support is provided by a unitary moulding 

with the pegs (14,16) formed integrally therewith. 
A roof structure according to Claims 2 and 3 wherein the 
pegs (14,16) are of rounded cross-section or substantially so. 
A roof structure according to either one of Claims 3 and 
4 wherein the moulding is formed from a plastics material. 
A roof structure according to Claim 5 wherein the plastics 
material is polyethylene. 
A roof structure according to Claim 1 wherein the spaced-apart 
pegs (14a,16a) are provided on a tile batten (30) of mouldable 

material. 
A roof structure according to Claim 7 wherein the pegs (14a,16a) are 
moulded integrally with the tile batten (30).  

 
A roof structure according to Claim 8 wherein the pegs (14a,16a) are 
of rounded cross-section or substantially so. 
A roof structure according to any one of Claims 7, 8 and 9 
wherein the tile batten (30) is formed from a plastics 

material. 
A roof structure according to Claim 10 wherein the 
plastics material is polyethylene. 
A method of tiling a roof comprising the steps of: 

a) providing on or associated with the tile battens (8,30) of 
a roof a series of tile engaging means provided by 

spaced-apart pegs and, 
b) tiling the roof with tiles by mounting said tiles on 
associated ones of the spaced-apart pegs,
 
whereby the tiles are retained on the roof, 

characterised in that said pegs (14, 16, 14a, 16a) extend normally, or substantially 
so, in use to the roof on which the tile 

battens are affixed and said tiles are provided with apertures 
which enable the mounting of the tiles onto said pegs in 

a force-fit relationship.
