<ABSTRACT>
Electrochemical sensor comprising many measurement zones (34) that can be isolated in turn and are located around the perimeter of an isolating disc (1), the zones being connected to each other by means of current collectors (16, 17) leading to central zones forming the contacts (23, 24) with a measuring apparatus. The contact disc also comprises disc rotating means (6), and markers of position (11) and of isolation (7) of the measurement zones (34) and can be housed in a case (40). For use in glucose determination.
