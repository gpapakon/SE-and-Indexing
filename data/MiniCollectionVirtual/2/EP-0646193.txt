<ABSTRACT>
The plane composite material of the invention consists of a thermoplastic film (2) having one side pierced to form a number of small perforated crater-like depressions (4), while the other smooth side is covered with predominantly thermoplastic fibres linked substantially continuously to one another or to the film (2). The material is useful as a breathable film for absorbent sanitary articles, especially trainers. The method of manufacture consists in a) dispersing a predominantly thermoplastic layer of fibres (3) onto a thermoplastic film (2), or extruding a thermoplastic film onto a non-woven fabric includng such fibres; b) placing the whole on a surface (12) provided with holes; and c) heating to a temperature in the region of the temperature for softening both thermoplastic materials while creating suction through the openings, so that the film bursts at the holes. The method can also include a preliminary stage, where the film is precoated with 0.2 to 5 g/m
<
2
>
 of adhesive, particularly, using to the melt-blown process.

A composite plane material constituted by a thermoplastic film
(2) covered in fibers, most of which are thermoplastic and that are bonded

to one another and to the film, said film having a multiplicity of craters (4) of
small dime
nsions on one of its faces, the material being characterised in
that the film comprises a smooth face and in that the fibers are bonded to

the film in substantially continuous manner over said smooth face.
A material according to claim 1, characterised in that the fibers
(3) are bonded to one another and to the film, even on the inside walls (5) of

the craters (4).
A material according to claim 1 or 2, characterised in that it
includes perforations at a density lying in the range 10 per cm
2
 to 100 per
cm
2
, the size of said perforations lying in the range 0.1 mm to 1.5 mm.
A material according to claim 1, characterised in that the
thermoplastic film (21) is covered with fibers (20) most of which are

thermoplastic and that are bonded to one another and to the film also on the
other face (21a) that has perforation craters (23).
The use of the composite plane material according to one of
claims 1 to 4, as a breathing film in the manufacture of absorbent hygiene

articles, in particular diapers and sanitary napkins.
A method of manufacturing the composite plane fiber material
according to claim 1, characterised in that it consists:


a) in dispering a sheet of fibers (3) most of which are thermoplastic
on a thermoplastic film (2);
b) in presenting the assembly made up in this way on a surface (12)
that is provided with orifices (14);
c) in heating said assembly to a temperature close to the softening
temperature of the thermoplastic materials constituting the fibers (3) and the

film (2) while simultaneously establishing suction through the orifice, so as
to cause the film over said orifices to puncture.
A method of manufacturing a composite plane fiber material
according to claim 1, characterised in that it consists in dispersing a sheet

of thermoplastic fibers on a perforated thermoplastic film having a
multiplicity of perforation craters of small dimensions on one of its faces, the

fibers being dispersed at least over the smooth, other face of the film while 
the fibers are at a temperature that is high enough to cause them to adhere

naturally to the surface of the film after it has cooled.
A method according to one of claims 6 or 7, characterised in that
it includes a prior step of pre-coating adhesive on the face of the film (2)

onto which the fibers (3) are dispersed.
A method according to one of claims 8 or 9, characterised in that
the adhesive is a thermoplastic adhesive resin that reacts at the

temperature at which the fibers come into contact with the film.
A method according to claim 9, characterised in that the pre-coating
is implemented by the melt-blown technique at a rate of 0.2 g/m
2
 to
5 g/m
2
 of adhesive.
A method according to one of claims 6 or 7, characterised in that
it consists in stretching the thermoplastic film while the fibers are being

dispersed on said film.
A method of manufacturing a composite plane fiber material
according to claim 1, characterised in that it consists:


a) in extruding a thermoplastic film on a non-woven fabric
constituted by a sheet of fibers most of which are thermoplastic;
b) in presenting the assembly constituted in this way onto a
surface (12) that is provided with orifices (14);
c) in heating said assembly to a temperature close to the
softening temperature for the thermoplastic materials constituting the fibers

(3) and the film (2) while simultaneously establishing suction through the
orifices so as to cause the film overlying said orifices to puncture.
A method according to one of claims 6 or 12, characterised in
that the surface on which the film/fiber assembly is presented is constituted

by the peripheral surface of a rotary drum (12) fitted with an internal suction
system.
