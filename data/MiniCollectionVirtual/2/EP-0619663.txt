<ABSTRACT>
A packet data transmission system is used to link a number of remote hand-held 
data-gathering units such as bar code readers to a central computer which maintains a 

database management system. Data packets are sent from the remote units by an RF 
link to intermediate base stations, then sent by the base stations to the central computer 

by a serial link. A frequency-hopping transmission method is used for the RF link. 
The remote units and base stations are all synchronized to a repeating pseudo-random 

sequence of frequencies in a band (902-928 MHz) which allows this type of transmission. 
The remote hand-held units initiate an exchange using RF transmission to and 

from the base stations, receiving only during a rigid time window following a 
transmission from the remote unit. The base stations cannot initiate communication to 

the remote units, but instead send data to the remote units only as part of the exchange. 
The reply messages from the base stations to the remotes contain synchronizing 

information to maintain coherence with the pseudo-random sequence.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to data communication systems, and more particularly to
an RF packet communication system in which a number of remote units send data to
a central computer via intermediate base stations.In US-A-5,029,183,
a packet data communication system is disclosed using a message-exchange
protocol in which a base station only sends a message to a remote terminal
in response to a message from the remote terminal. The remote terminal sends a
message to the base station only at a time of its own choosing, so the transceiver of the
remote terminal need not be continuously powered. The base station responds to a
message from a remote terminal within a rigid time window following the message
from the remote terminal. If there is a need to send a message originating at the base
station (or at a central computer), then the base station must wait until a message is
received from the remote before it can send the waiting message as part of its response
in the fixed time window. The system of US-A-5,029,183, in an example embodiment,
employs spread spectrum RF transmission.The system of US-A-5,029,183 provides a great improvement in the power drain
on a battery in a remote terminal, and thus allows construction of smaller, lighter, and
cheaper remote terminals.It is a feature of the present invention to provide an improved, low-cost, low-power,
packet data communication network in which a number of remote terminal units
are in a form of two-way communication with a central station, preferably a network
using an RF link or the like so that the remote units may move about freely in an area
to be covered by the network. Another feature is to provide an improved packet
transmission network in which remote terminal units may be of low cost, low power 
and small size, yet provide reliable and fast response, as may be needed in a
commercial facility (usually indoor) using bar code scanners or the like for data
gathering. Another feature is to provide an improved protocol for use in a packet data
transmission network which results in reliable and high-performance operation, low
power consumption and low cost implementation. A particular feature is to provide an
RF data link for portable terminals usable without site licensing under F.C.C. regulations,
so that the expense and delays incident to such licensing are eliminated or
minimized. Another feature is to provide a method of reducing the delay between
message initiation at a base terminal and message receipt at a remote terminal in a
system in which only
