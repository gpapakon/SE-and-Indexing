<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a copolymer of at least one lactone and at least one cyclic carbonate, the carbonate being polycyclic. This makes it possible to obtain cross-linked copolymers. The mechanical properties of objects obtained with these are considerably better than the mechanical properties of objects on the basis of non-cross-linked copolymers. The material is tough - in particular the tensile strength is higher -, impact resistant, less crystalline than non-cross-linked copolymer and it is biodegradable.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a copolymer of at least 
one lactone and at least one cyclic carbonate, 
characterized in that the carbonate is a polycyclic 
carbonate with at least two cyclic structures that 
contain a carbonate group. Such a copolymer is known from US-A-4.705.820, 
which patent specification discloses a copolymer of 
glycolide and trimethylene carbonate (TMC). Such polymers and copolymers are applied, inter 
alia, in the medical world, where objects on the basis of 
these materials are implanted in the human or animal body. 
If the implanted material is to fulfill a (temporary) 
supporting function, good material properties, such as 
toughness and stiffness, are required. One way of obtaining a good toughness and stiffness 
is to use semi-crystalline material. Semi-crystalline 
material can be obtained, for instance, by the use of 
controlled polymerization conditions or special after-treatments, 
both as known from literature. Such polymers and copolymers further are 
interesting mainly because the material is biodegradable. 
This implies that the polymer hydrolyzes and disintegrates 
into its constituent parts under certain biological 
conditions, such as for instance physiological conditions. An implanted object based on such polymers or 
copolymers should not stay in the body for too long so as to 
avoid any tissue reactions and give the body-specific 
structure, which the implant was meant to support, the 
chance to regain its own firmness. This means that rapid 
degradation and resorption are required as soon as the 
temporary support function of the implant is no longer 
needed.  
 The drawback of copolymers with a high 
crystallinity is that they disintegrate into high-crystallinity, 
possibly needle-shaped fragments during 
degradation, which are resorbed only very slowly, on account 
of which tissue reactions may occur that are harmful to the 
patient. It is the object of the invention to furnish a 
copolymer that possesses good mechanical properties, has a 
good resorption velocity and does not cause troublesome 
complications upon degradation. According to the invention this is achieved in that 
the carbonate is polycyclic. This renders it possible to obtain cross-linked 
copolymers. The mechanical properties of objects based on 
these copolymers are significantly better than those of 
objects on the basis of non-cross-linked copolymers. The 
material is tough - in particularly the tensile strength is 
higher -, impact resistant, less crystalline than non-cross-linked 
copolymer
