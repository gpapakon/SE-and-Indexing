<ABSTRACT>
The oligomers of the present invention are polyureas, polycarbonates, polyesters or polyamides having a number average molecular weight of 
<
 10,000. These oligomers are water-soluble, have a rigid backbone with a predictable anion spacing, and are pharmaceutically-acceptable. The oligomers are useful for inhibiting angiogenesis and can be used in the treatment of tumors and metastasis.

<DESCRIPTION>
 ANTIANGIOGENIC OLIGOMERSThe invention relates to the use of certain anionic oligomers which inhibit angiogenesis. These compounds can be used in the treatment of, for example, atherosclerosis, tumors, and metastasis.Angiogenesis or neovascularization is the process by which new blood vessels originate as capillaries. This process is necessary in certain beneficial processes, such as wound healing and embryogenesis. Angiogenesis is also believed to be an essential prerequisite to certain deleterious effects, such as tumor growth and diabetic retinopathy. Nonvascularized tumors remain small in size, typically less than a few millimeters in diameter. The size of such tumors, both primary solid tumors and metastatic tumors, is limited by the ability of nutrients to diffuse into the tumor. Once vascularized however, tumors can grow rapidly and quickly become a clinical problem. Evidence suggests that tumors release a substance, termed tumor angiogenesis factor, which stimulates nearby endothelial cells to produce capillaries. Thus, if the ability of the tumor cell to release tumor angiogenesis factor could be suppressed or if the substance, once released could be rendered ineffectual, primary and metastatic tumor implantation or growth once implanted could be prevented and disease suppressed. 

 Other deleterious conditions are known to be associated with neovasularization, such as neovascular diseases of the eye, such as retrolental fibroplasia, diabetic retinopathy, and neovascular glaucoma. Such conditions, as well as tumors and tumor metastasis, could be treated by administration of an anti-angiogenesis agent. Heparin and heparin sulfate have been reported to be effective for these purposes.Applicants have discovered that a class of synthetic oligomers are heparinmimetic in that this class of oligomers inhibits proliferative activity by means of anti¬ angiogenic activity. Such oligomers would thus be useful in the treatment of a variety of diseases and conditions associated with angiogenesis.SUMMARY OF THE INVENTIONThis invention relates to the use of anionic polyamide and polyurea oligomers of formulae la and lb, respectively.wherein
