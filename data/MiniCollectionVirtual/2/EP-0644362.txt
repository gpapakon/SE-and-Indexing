<ABSTRACT>
A control system/method (104) for controlling execution of selected shifts of 
a mechanical transmission system (10) is provided. The control system includes 

a central processing unit (106) for receiving input signals indicative of engine or 
input shaft (11/98) speeds and of output shaft or vehicle speed (VS) speeds and 

from a driver control console (108) indicative of manual or automatic selection of 
upshifts or downshifts from a currently engaged gear ratio and processing the 

same in accordance with predetermined logic rule to issue command output signals 
to a transmission actuator (112, 70, 96) to implement the selected shifts upon a 

manually or automatically caused torque break of the transmission and manually 
or automatically caused substantial synchronization of the transmission thereafter. 

The predetermined logic rules include a strategy for sensing conditions indicative 
of a potentially dangerous downhill free-wheeling situation and for immediately 

causing the forced engagement of a gear ratio (GR
FE
) determined as a function of 
vehicle speed regardless of the presence or absence of substantially synchronous 

conditions.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to vehicular automatic or partially automatic 
mechanical transmission systems and, in particular, to partially automatic 
mechanical transmission systems of the type providing partially automatic 
implementation of manually or automatically selected changes or shifting of 
mechanical transmission gear ratios. More particularly, the present invention relates to a control system which 
enhances recovery from missed shifts in a partially automatic shift implementation 
requiring the vehicle operator or system controller to create synchronous or 
substantially synchronous conditions for engagement of the transmission 
nonsynchronized jaw clutches. Fully automatic transmission systems, both for heavy-duty vehicles such as 
heavy-duty trucks, and for automobiles, that sense throttle openings or positions, 
vehicle speeds, engine speeds, and the like, and automatically shift the vehicle 
transmission in accordance therewith, are well known in the prior art. Such fully 
automatic change gear transmission systems include automated transmissions 
wherein pressurized fluid is utilized to frictionally engage one or more members to 
other members or to a ground to achieve a selected gear ratio as well as automated 
mechanical transmissions utilizing electronic and/or pneumatic logic and actuators 
to engage and disengage mechanical (i.e. positive) clutches to achieve a desired 
gear ratio. Examples of such transmissions may be seen by reference to U.S.  
 
Patent Nos. 3,961,546; 4,081,065 and 4,361,060. Such fully automatic change gear transmissions can be unacceptably 
expensive, particularly for the largest heavy-duty vehicles which are not typically 
sold in high volumes. Additionally, those automatic change gear transmissions 
utilizing pressurized fluid and/or torque converters tend to be relatively inefficient 
in terms of power dissipated between the input and output shafts thereof. Semi-automatic transmission systems utilizing electronic control units which 
sense throttle position, engine, input shaft, output shaft and/or vehicle speed, and 
utilize automatically controlled fuel throttle devices, gear shifting devices and/or 
master clutch operating devices to substantially fully automatically implement 
operator manually selected transmission ratio changes are known in the prior art. 
Examples of such semi-automatic transmission systems may be seen by reference 
to U.S. Patent Nos. 4,425,620; 4,631,679 and 4,648,290. While such semi-automatic mechanical transmission systems are very
