characterised in that

it contains amines of the general formula I together with amines of
the general formula II.
A disinfectant solution according to claim 1 or 2, 
characterised in
that
 it contains amines in which, in the general formulae, R has 8
to 18 C atoms and n + m together have a value of 6 and
 p has a
value of 3. 
A disinfectant solution according to claims 1 to 3, 
characterised in
that

A disinfectant solution according to claims 1 to 6, 
characterised in
that
 it is present in water as a solvent or in substantially aqueous-alcoholic
solutions.
A disinfectant solution according to claim 7, 
characterised in that

the aqueous-alcoholic solvents contain ethanol, isopropanol, n-propanol,
glycols or glycerol.
A disinfectant solution according to claims 1 to 8, 
characterised in
that

0.01 wt.% up to the solubility limit.
A disinfectant solution according to claims 1 to 9, 
characterised in
that
 it additionally contains surfactants and/or corrosion
inhibitors and/or defoaming agents and/or wetting agents and/or

complexing agents and/or thickeners and/or colorants and/or
perfumes.
Use of disinfectant solutions according to claims 1 to 10 for waste-collecting
toilet systems, 
characterised in that
 the application 
concentration is at least 0.005 to approximately 5 wt.% based on

the total amine content.
Use of disinfectant solutions according to claims 1 to 10 for
collecting containers for animal excreta, 
characterised in that
 the
application concentration is at least 0.005 to approximately

12 wt.% based on the total amine content.
