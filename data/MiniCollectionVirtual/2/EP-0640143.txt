<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention is in the field of recombinant DNA technology. This
invention is directed to a gene sequence and a protein capable of inhibiting DNA
synthesis in a recipient cell. This invention was supported with Government funds.
The Government has certain rights in this invention.Normal human diploid cells have a finite potential for proliferative growth
(Hayflick, L. et al., Exp. Cell. Res.25:585 (1961); Hayflick, L., Exp. Cell. Res.
37:614 (1965)). Indeed, under controlled conditions in vitro cultures human cells can
maximally proliferate only to about 80 cumulative population doublings. The
proliferative potential of such cells has been found to be a function of the number a
cumulative population doublings which the cell has undergone (Hayflick, L., et al.,
Exp. Cell. Res25:585 (1961); Hayflick, L. et al., Exp. Cell. Res.37:614 (1985)).
This potential is also inversely proportional to the in vivo age of the cell donor
(Martin, G. M. et al., Lab. Invest.23:86 (1979); 
Goldstein, S. et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. (U.S.A.)64:155
(1969); Schneider, E.L., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. (U.S.A.)
73:3584 (1976); LeGuilty, Y. et al., Gereontologia19:303
(1973)).Cells that have exhausted their potential for
proliferative growth are said to have undergone "senescence."
Cellular senescence in vitro is exhibited by morphological
changes and is accompanied by the failure of a cell to respond
to exogenous growth factors. Cellular senescence, thus,
represents a loss of the proliferative potential of the cell.
Although a variety of theories have been proposed to explain
the phenomenon of cellular senescence in vitro, experimental
evidence suggests that the age-dependent loss of proliferative
potential may be the function of a genetic program (Orgel,
L.E., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. (U.S.A.)49:517 (1963); De Mars,
R. et al., Human Genet.16:87 (1972); M. Buchwald, Mutat. Res.
44:401 (1977); Martin, G.M. et al., Amer. J. Pathol.74:137
(1974); Smith, J.R. et al., Mech. Age. Dev.13:387 (1980);
Kirkwood, T.B.L. et al., Theor. Biol.53:481 (1975).Cell fusion studies with human fibroblasts in vitro have
demonstrated that the quiescent phenotype of cellular
senescence is dominant over the proliferative phenotype
(Pereira-Smith, O.M et al., Somat. Cell Genet.8:731 (1982);
Norwood, T.H. et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. (U.S.A.)71:223
(1974); Stein, G.H. et al., Exp. Cell Res.130:155 (1979)).Insight into the phenomenon of senescence has been gained
from studies in which senescent and young (i.e. non-senescent)
cells have been fused
