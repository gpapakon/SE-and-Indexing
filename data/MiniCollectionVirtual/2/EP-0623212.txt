<ABSTRACT>
Diacetyl, especially resulting from spoilage of chilled red meat, is monitored by exposing an aromatic ortho-diamine at acidic pH to an environment containing, or possibly containing, diacetyl and detecting any change in absorption or reflection of electromagnetic radiation due to the ortho-diamine.

<DESCRIPTION>
 FOOD SPOILAGE DETECTION METHODThis invention relates to a method of detecting food(Including beverage) spoilage and Is particularly, although not exclusively, concerned with the detection of spoilage In chilled foodstuffs, such as red meats, during processing, transportation and/or storage.The monitoring and control of the condition of fresh foodstuffs, which have been given enhanced, but not indefinite, shelf life by chilling and refrigerated storage, poses a major problem in our health conscious society. Thus the consumer demands fresh food, conveniently packaged, and with all-the-year round availability in shops and supermarkets, while at the same time insisting that there is no danger of spoilage leading to impaired looks or flavour, or, more importantly, health risk, in the purchased foods.Oxidation of lipids, nucleotide degradation by endogenous enzymes and bacterial growth processes involving the metabolism of a wide range of food constituents including carbohydrates and amino adds can all contribute to losses in sensory qualities of foods and their ultimate rejection by the consumer. The relative importance of these various spoilage processes may vary from product to product, with conditions of transportation and storage, with intended use etc., but the consequences of bacterial growth are commonly an important contributory factor. This is especially the ca 9 for chilled-fresh foods.Determinations of trie extent and/or precise nature of spoilage may be required for routine quality assurance, for regulatory purposes or for establishing the cause for any particular condition and hence appropriate remedial action. Sensory and microbiological criteria are traditionally used for these purposes, but both have their limitations. The subjectivity of sensory data poses many problems in routine use, not least because of the difficulties In assigning meaningful criteria for differentiating "acceptable from non-acceptable" 

 (or "spoiled from non-spoiled") product. While total bacterial numbers often bear some relationship to acceptability, there are still problems in their use. Not all bacteria growing on food necessarily contribute to spoilage, nor is there a consistent relationship between bacterial numbers and spoilage. Thus, high pH meat (dark, firm, dry: DFD), spoils at lower cell densities than normal-pH meat under identical storage conditions whereas, on vacuum-packaged meat, bacterial numbers may reach a maximum and then remain unchanged for significant periods without obvious sensory

CLAIMS
1. A method of monitoring the presence of diacetyl comprising exposing an aromatic ortho-diamine at acidic pH to an environment containing, or possibly containing, diacetyl and detecting any change in absorption or reflection of electro¬ magnetic radiation due to the ortho-diamine.
2. A method according to claim 1 wherein the aromatic ortho- diamine has the general formula (I)
wherein each X and Y, which may be the same or different, represents -N- or -CH-, R
1
 is a conjugated system which may be linear or cyclic or a combination thereof, R
2
 is a conjugated system, which may be linear or cyclic or a combination thereof, or a hydrogen atom or a non-conjugated monovalent substituent group or R- and R
2
 together form a cyclic or multicyclic conjugated system; or, when X and/or Y is -CH-, R
1
 and X and/or R
2
 and Y together form a cyclic or multicyclic conjugated system.
3. A method according to claim 2 wherein R
2
 is hydrogen and R- is a phenyl or benzoyl group, which may be substituted.
4. A method according to claim 3 wherein the ortho-diamine is 3,4-diaminobenzophenone or 3,3'-diaminobenzidine.
5. A method according to any one of the preceding claims wherein the ortho-diamine is present as a transition metal complex.
6. A method according to claim 5 wherein the ortho-diamine is a complex of nickel chloride with 3,3'-di minobenzidine.
7. A method according to any one of the preceding claims intended for the monitoring of diacetyl produced during spoilage or change in condition of fresh foodstuffs.
8. A method according to claim 7 intended for the monitoring of diacetyl produced during spoilage of red meat. 


 9. A method according to any one of the preceding claims wherein the detection of change in absorption or reflection of electromagnetic radiation due to the orthodiamine is carried out using fibre optics. 10. Transition metal complexes of compounds of formula I as defined in claim 2.
11. A nickel or cobalt transition metal complex of 3,4-diamino- benzophenone or 3,3'-diaminobenzidine.
12. A complex of nickel chloride with 3,3'-diaminobenzidine. 13. An apparatus, suitable for use in the monitoring method as defined in any one of claims 1 to 9, comprising a source of electromagnetic radiation of wavelength covering the region in which the change is to be detected, means for transmitting such radiation to an aromatic ortho-diamine, means for exposing the ortho-diamine to the environment to be monitored and means for detecting a change in absorption or reflection of the electro¬ magnetic radiation due to the ortho-diamine. 14. An apparatus according to claim 13, wherein the means for transmitting radiation comprises one or more optical fibres. 15. A foodstuff package, at-- least a portion of which incorporates an aromatic ortho-diamine, the diamine being positioned so as to be in contact with the environment surrounding the foodstuff.
16. A device intended for handling foodstuff known on spoilage or change in condition to generate diacetyl, at least a portion of which device incorporates an aromatic ortho-diamine, the diamine being positioned so that, in use, it will be in contact with the environment surrounding the foodstuff.
17. A foodstuff package according to claim 15 or a device according to claim 16 wherein the diamine is borne by a patch forming part of or applied to the package or device.
18. A foodstuff package or device according to any one of claims 15 to 17 wherein the diamine is as defined in any one of claims 2 to 6. 19. A foodstuff package or device according to any one of claims 15 to 18 wherein the foodstuff is selected from red meat, game and citrus fruit products.
