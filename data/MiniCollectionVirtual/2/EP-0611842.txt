<ABSTRACT>
An elongated element or sewing thread (7) has a portion 
thereof formed with at least one fluorescent latent marking (12) 

containing a fluorescent substance. Passage of the fluorescent 
latent marking past a detecting position is detected by a non-contact 

photoelectric detecting system (15). The photoelectric 
detecting system (15) includes a light emitting element (17) for emitting 

a beam of light towards the elongated element (7), and a light 
detecting element (18) for sensing light emitted from that portion 

of the elongated element or sewing thread upon excitation of 
the fluorescent substance by radiations from the light emitting 

element. The non-contact photoelectric detecting system (15) is so 
designed that, upon receipt of the light emitted from that 

portion of the elongated element or sewing thread, the light 
detecting element may issue a signal (S₁) indicative of the passage 

of that portion of elongated element past the detecting position 
at which the radiations from the light emitting element 

reach. The signal (S₁) outputted from the light detecting element 
(18) and, hence, the photoelectric detecting system (15) may be utilized 

as representing a condition of the elongated element or sewing 
thread (7), for example, the amount of the elongated element or 

sewing thread left on a bobbin or reel (8), or an approach of 
exhaustion of the thread element or sewing thread from the 

bobbin or reel.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a detecting mechanism 
in the sewing machine which detecting the presence or 
absence of a thread wound around a under thread bobbin, and is 
applicable in both industrial and home sewing machines. As is well known to those skilled in the art, when 
for example, bobbin thread wound around a bobbin accommodated 
beneath the needle plate has been completely exhausted, the 
empty bobbin must either receive a supply of bobbin thread 
wound again around the empty bobbin or it must be replaced with 
another bobbin around which thread has been wound beforehand. 
It has been a long established practice either to remove the 
empty bobbin from the sewing machine so that the empty bobbin 
can be wound with bobbin thread by the use of a bobbin winding 
device, or to prepare a number of bobbins in anticipation of 
the replacement. In the case of the conventional industrial sewing 
machine, due to mechanical limitations the length of the bobbin 
thread wound around the bobbin is relatively short, say, about 
200 meters whereas that of the upper or needle thread runs 
about 5,000 meters. For this reason, a frequent replacement of 
the empty bobbin with another bobbin is required before the 
upper or needle thread is exhausted. Not only is this 
cumbersome, but also the sewing efficiency tends to be 
decrease.  No means for detecting the time elapsed until the 
bobbin may be emptied, that is, the point at which the bobbin 
is replaced with another bobbin, have hitherto been installed 
in any conventional sewing machine. Under these circumstances, 
the determination of the necessity of bobbin replacement depends 
on the use of imagination and skill of worker operating 
the sewing machine. If the worker continues the sewing job 
without knowing that the bobbin thread has completely been 
used, that is, the bobbin has been emptied, a piece of cloth 
being sewn is fed idle past the sewing needle with no lock 
stitch formed thereon. Once this occurs, the attendant worker 
is forced to re-try the sewing operation. This involves a 
problem in that perforations left by the sewing needle with no 
thread passed therethrough may impair the appearance of the 
piece of cloth. In order to substantially eliminate the problems discussed 
above, an attempt has been made to count the number of 
revolution of the bobbin within the sewing machine in the hope 
that a cue for the amount of bobbin thread remaining on the 
bobbin can be available. This attempt has, however, been found insufficient.
