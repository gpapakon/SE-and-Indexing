<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a machine for the continuous manufacture of wrappers, pouches, envelopes and similar products (1'), consisting in particular of paper, having at least one front part (2), one rear part (4) and having a stationary bottom consisting of at least one bottom flap (7, 10) and optionally having a closure flap (9), the machine (44) including a plurality of stations for the production of precreases (13-18, 25-27 or 31-34, respectively), for trimming the contour and for gluing and folding and for cutting off web-shaped material (40) or, respectively, for the corresponding processing of an individual blank (1) or preform (1''). The nucleus of the invention lies in the fact that a fold-back device (45, 45') is provided for the backwards displacement of a bottom flap (10) in a zig-zag shape, directed opposite to the transport direction.

A process for the production of envelopes, bags, despatch
pouches and the like products (1'), in particular comprising paper, with or

without side folds (23, 24), wherein the products (1') have at least a
front portion (2), a rear portion (4) and at least one bottom flap (7, 10)

for a bottom for the product to stand upon, and possibly a closure flap
(9), for which purpose material (4) in web form or individual blanks (1) or

blank portions (1'') are processed, provided for that purpose with
preliminary breaks (13-18 or 25-27 or 31-34), the contour is cut to size

and the individual blanks (1) or blank portions (1'') are folded and
provided with glue, and wherein material forming a bottom flap (10) is

moved back in a zig-zag shape,

   characterised in that the material forming the bottom flap (10) is
moved back in a zig-zag shape in opposite relationship to the direction of

transportation movement in continuous further transportation movement of a
tubular web portion (42) or a tubular blank portion (1'') which has already

been cut into individual pieces.
A process according to claim 1 characterised in that upon
continuous transportation movement of the material (40) the bottom flap

(10) is engaged, then lifted and then lowered again upon further continuous
advance movement of the blank portion (1'') or a tubular web portion (42).
A process according to at least one of the preceding claims
characterised in that the bottom flap (10) is lifted by means of suction

air at its rear side and then lowered again by means of the suction air
element (55) while the blank portion (1'')/the tubular web portion (42) is

continuously moved further along in the direction of transportation
movement.
A process according to at least one of the preceding claims
characterised in that the bottom flap (10) is lifted, moved back and

lowered, while the blank portion (1'')/the tubular web portion (42) is
passing over a working roller (48). 
Apparatus for carrying out the process according to claim 1
comprising at least one folding-back device (45, 45') which lifts the

bottom flap (10) and which has at least one suction element (55), wherein
the suction element (55) is provided for lif
ting the bottom flap (10),

   characterised in that the suction element (45) is provided for
moving back the bottom flap in a zig-zag shape in the opposite direction to

the direction of transportation movement and at the same time for lowering
the bottom flap (10).
Apparatus according to claim 5 characterised in that the suction
element (55) is arranged and driven to engage the bottom flap (10), lift it

in a parallel position with respect to the plane of transportation movement
and upon further transportation movement of the tubular web portion

(42)/the tubular blank portion (1'') to move it back and then lower it.
Apparatus according to at least one of the preceding apparatus
claims characterised in that the folding-back device (45, 45') includes a

working roller (48).
Apparatus according to at least one of the preceding apparatus
claims characterised in that the suction element (55) is movable forward

and back radially relative to the working roller (48) and that a folding
blade (56) is movable forward and back tangentially with respect to the

working roller (48).
Apparatus according to at least one of the preceding apparatus
claims characterised in that there are provided a plurality of suction

elements (55) and a plurality of folding blades (56).
Apparatus according to at least one of the preceding apparatus
claims characterised in that the suction elements (55) and the folding

blades (56) are respectively arranged on arms (57, 58) and are mounted
pivotably about the arms (57, 58) as a radius. 
Apparatus according to at least one of the preceding apparatus
claims characterised in that the arms of the suction elements (55) and the

arms (58) of the folding blades (56) are each arranged approximately
perpendicularly relative to each other in the waiting position and in the

working position.
Apparatus according to at least one of the preceding apparatus
claims characterised in that the pivot axes (59, 60) of the suction

elements (55) and the folding blades (56) are arranged parallel to the
plane of transportation movement of the tubular web portions (42)/tubular

blank portions (1'') and transversely with respect to the direction of
transportation movement of the web portions (42)/blank portions (1'').
Apparatus according to at least one of the preceding claims
apparatus claims characterised in that the folding blade (56) has a folding

blade cutting edge (65) which faces in the direction of transportation
movement.
Apparatus according to at least one of the preceding apparatus
claims characterised in that the folding blade (56) is so arranged that it

engages a preliminary fold-back break (33, 34) of a rear fold-back portion
(43).
Apparatus according to at least one of the preceding apparatus
claims characterised in that the suction elements (55) perform an at least

partially linear stroke movement.
