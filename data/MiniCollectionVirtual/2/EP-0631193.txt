<ABSTRACT>
A color toner for developing an electrostatic 
image contains a binder resin and a colorant. The 

color toner has a weight average particle diameter of 
from 3 µm to 7 µm. The color toner contains from 10% 

to 70% by number of color toner particles with a 
particle diameter of 4.00 µm or smaller, not less than 

40% by number of color toner particles with a particle 
diameter of 5.04 µm or smaller, from 2% to 20% by 

volume of color toner particles with a particle 
diameter of 8.00 µm or larger, and not more than 6% by 

volume of color toner particles with a particle 
diameter of 10.08 µm or larger. The color toner has 

such a coloring power that an image having been fixed 
on a transfer medium has an image density (D
0.5
) of 
from 1.0 to 1.8 when an unfixed color toner on the 

transfer medium is in a quantity (M/S) of 0.50 mg/cm².

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a color toner used
in a developer for developing an electrostatic image
in image forming processes such as electrophotography,
electrostatic recording and electrostatic printing.
It also relates to a process for its production.It is conventionally known to form an image on
the surface of a photoconductive material by an
electrostatic means and develop the image.A large number of methods are known, as
disclosed in U.S. Patent No. 2,297,691, Japanese
Patent Publications No. 42-23910 and No. 43-24748 and
so forth. In general, an electrostatic latent image
is formed on a photo-sensitive member, utilizing
a photoconductive material and various means, and
subsequently a toner is caused to adhere onto the
latent image to form a toner image corresponding to
the electrostatic latent image.Next, the toner image is transferred to an
image holding medium such as paper if necessary,
followed by fixing by the action of heat, pressure,
heat and pressure, or solvent vapor. A copy is thus 
obtained. In a case where the process comprises a
toner-image transfer step, the process is usually
provided with the step of removing the toner remaining
on the photosensitive member.As developing methods by which the
electrostatic latent image is formed into a visible
image by the use of a toner, known methods can be
exemplified by the powder cloud development as
disclosed in U.S. Patent No. 2,221,776, the cascade
development as disclosed in U.S. Patent No. 2,618,552,
the magnetic brush development as disclosed in U.S.
Patent No. 2,874,063, and a method in which a
conductive magnetic toner is used, as disclosed in
U.S. Patent No. 3,909,258.As toners used in these developing methods, a
fine powder obtained by mixing and dispersing a
colorant in a thermoplastic resin has been commonly
used. The thermoplastic resin most commonly includes
polystyrene resins. Besides, polyester resins, epoxy
resins, acrylic resins and urethane resins are also
used. As the colorant, carbon black is most widely
used in the case of non-magnetic toners. In the case
of magnetic toners, black magnetic powder of an iron
oxide type are widely used. In a system in which a
two-component type developer is used, the toner is
usually used in a mixture with carrier particles such as 
glass beads, iron powder and ferrite powder.The toner image finally formed on a copy image
holding medium such as paper is fixed onto the image
holding medium by the action of heat, pressure or heat
and pressure. In this fixing, the step of fixing by
heat has
